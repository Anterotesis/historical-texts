            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

This Promiſe was fulfilled in the great Muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Change, which was made by the Goſpel, in which this Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt was an excellent Inſtrument: Some attribute it to the Secrecy and Sublimity of that matter which he delivereth, as having more familiarity with Chriſt, then others, for he uſed to lean on his Breaſt, and ſo might receive ſome peculiar inſtruction from Chriſt.

Whatſoever therefore we finde delivered by this Divine Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, we are with much reverence and awfull reſpect to receive it.

               </gap>, the Divine Nature of Christ, although the <hi>Socinians</hi> have ſacrilegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly perverted the beginning of that first Chapter of <hi>John</hi> to another ſenſe, then of Chriſts Eternal Deity (which yet was uſed inſtrumental<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to convert <hi>Junius</hi> from his Atheiſme.) Now although the whole matter delivered thus by this Evangeliſt be ſo admirable and excellent, yet this Seventeenth Chapter, wherein is related the Prayer of Christ for believers, not long before his Death (and mentioned onely by him) hath ſome appropriated Reaſons for a more peculiar Attention and Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction towards it; Hence it hath alwayes had a peculiar Preſidency in the hearts of Believers: So that the opening of this <hi>precious Box of Ointment,</hi> muſt needs ſend forth a <hi>refreſhing fragrant ſmell to thoſe that are ſpiritual;</hi> For it is truly ſaid by <hi>Melancthon</hi> concerning this Prayer, <hi>Nec digniorem, necſanctiorem, nec fructuoſiorem, nec magis patheticam vocem in Coelo ac Terrâ unquam fuiſſe audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam, quam hanc ipſius Filii precationem;</hi> There was never a more excellent, more holy, more fruitfull, and more affectionate voice ever heard in Heaven or Earth, then this Prayer. So that we may call this Chapter, as ſome of the Pſalms are, <hi>A Chapter of Degrees,</hi> If this reaſon may be admitted of that Inſcription, becauſe they did ſurpaſſe other Pſalmes in Excellency, as alſo thereby the ſoul was like <hi>Elijah</hi> carried up in a <hi>fiery Chariot to Heaven,</hi> At the end of every verſe we may write <hi>Selah.</hi> There was a very ſuperſtitious Cuſtome among Chriſtians in <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi>'s time, which he doth ſeverely inveigh against, that they would hang this Goſpel of <hi>John,</hi> or part of it about their necks, as an Anulete, nor a Spell againſt malignant things: But cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, a gracious heart, preſerving this Prayer of Chriſt, and making a wiſe and skilfull improvement thereof, will finde it wonderfully ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious, both for the increaſe of Godlineſſe and Comfort, here will be both Bread to nouriſh, and Wine to refreſh and comfort. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though therefore multitude of Books be complained of, as glutting the world; So that we may justly think there are more Books then Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, yet the Excellency, perpetual Uſefulneſſe, and raviſhing Conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the matter delivered by our Saviour in this Valedictory Prayer, have prevailed with me to publiſh theſe Expoſitory Sermons to the world, and the rather, not knowing of any Engliſh Writer, who hath purpoſely made it his buſineſse to explicate and practically improve this Chapter, whereas ſome other parts of Scripture have been diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:65216:3"/>
diſcuſſed. In the managing of this Work, I have occaſionally enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into ſome <hi>Socinian</hi> and <hi>Arminian</hi> Diſputes, ſome Verſes in this Chapter being the proper ſubject for them. Although the greateſt part of my Work is to make Honey rather then to ſting; to informe us how to believe and walk in a Chriſtian life, then to diſpute and digladi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate about Controverſies, for we ſeldome <hi>gather Grapes from ſuch Thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles;</hi> Yea ſometimes in ſtead of Conviction, they work confirmation in thoſe Errours, the mindes of men are prepoſſeſſed with. And here I ſhall take leave to enter into a ſhort Digreſsion, which would have come out more ſeaſonably long before this time, but I had no opportunity till this occaſion was offered to me.</p>
            <p>Not long ſince I publiſhed <hi>The Second Part of the Treatiſe of Juſtification,</hi> wherein among other particulars, my Work was to prove, <hi>That Works, though done by Grace, are not the Condition of our Juſtification, but that we are juſtified alone by Faith, as the Means or Inſtrument receiving of it.</hi> Theſe two kindes of Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation (viz. <hi>by Faith receiving, or Faith and Workes as a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi>) I conceive to differ ſpecifically one from the other, and that he who is justified the one way cannot be the other. The former way, as the Scripture doth maintain, ſo generally the Reformed Churches have readily inſiſted in; The latter way the Remonstrants have vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pleaded for, oppoſing <hi>Faiths inſtrumentality in Juſtification,</hi> with whom <hi>Vorſtius</hi> and <hi>Grotius</hi> in this, Opinion aſſociate themſelves, as alſo one or two late Engliſh Writers, Doctor <hi>Hammond, Pract. Catech.</hi> lib. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. Sect. <hi>3.</hi> Now when I had endeavoured to ſtate the Queſtion in a moſt candid and fair way between thoſe that deny Works to be a Condition <hi>ſine quâ non</hi> of our Juſtification, and thoſe who affirme. A Reverend and Learned Brother, judging himſelf to be concerned in this Opinion likewiſe, doth complain of the want of candor and truth (<hi>Confeſſ. Preface</hi>) in my ſtating of the Queſtion, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I rather expected thanks for my ingenuity: For first, I ſaid, All Merit and Efficiency was with great diſtaſte removed from theſe works of Grace in our Justification: Therefore the Question was, <hi>Upon what account theſe are required in Juſtified perſons, Whether in ſome Cauſality or Concurrence, as Faith is, onely not with ſuch a Degree of Excellency</hi>? Now let any Judicious Reader, that is acquainted with this Controverſie decide, wherein any candour or truth may be deſired herein: For I ſay Cauſality (which is a general word) not Efficiencie or Merit. Againe, I ſay, Some Cauſalitie, <hi>Cauſalitas quaedam,</hi> which is <hi>Terminus diminuens;</hi> Yea, I added the word Concurrence, which might eaſily ſatisfie any, how low I brought the Queſtion; Yea, as if this had not been enough, I propounded it in other termes, <hi>Whether good Workes be required, as well as Faith</hi>? Yet when I had done all this, he complaineth, as if wrong were done. I am ſtill more confirmed, and that by this inſtance, in what I delivered in that Preface, That it is not a compendious or proper way to finde out truth, and diſcover an Errour, by dealing with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb facs="tcp:65216:4"/>
according to their particular expreſsions, or to attend to perſonall reflexions, but to abſtract the Queſtion, and to handle it in <hi>Theſi,</hi> For how many words upon words may be multiplied in this very parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular. My Reverend Brother ſaith, <hi>He vehemently diſclaimeth all Cauſality of Workes in Juſtification:</hi> Surely his meaning is all Proper Cauſall Efficiency (and ſo did I in the ſtating of it) but to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Cauſality in a large ſenſe is plainly to contradict himſelf: For in his <hi>Aphoriſme 74 Theſis, They both</hi> (viz.) <hi>Faith and Works juſtifie in the ſame kinde of Cauſality,</hi> viz. as <hi>Cauſae ſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </note> And my Learned Brother ſaith, <hi>Some conditions</hi> (and moſt among men) <hi>are Morall Impulſive cauſes.</hi> I finde ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing urged likewiſe, as not fair dealing, and that is, To fasten
<pb facs="tcp:65216:4"/>
upon his Opinion, that we may ſay a <hi>Juſtifying Repentance,</hi> as well as <hi>Juſtifying Faith,</hi> and alſo <hi>Juſtifying Love</hi>; Indeed in my Book it is <hi>Law,</hi> and that was the Printers fault, which I am ſorry for, becauſe I ſee my Learned Brother ſo much moved at that, as if he were charged to hold a <hi>juſtifying Law,</hi> it ſhould have been <hi>Love:</hi> But why doth this offend my Reverend Brother? He doth not ſay, It is not true to ſay, <hi>juſtifying Repentance,</hi> or <hi>juſtifying Love,</hi> but it is not fit to ſay, <hi>(Confeſſ. in the Pref.)</hi> Why is it not fit, if it be true? It may be ſuch an expreſsion would be offenſive to godly eares, and therefore not fit: Can Love be a Condition of Juſtification, and yet not Juſtifying Love as a Condition? This ſeemeth very ſtrange. But it's ſaid, <hi>Faith hath a peculiar fitneſſe and aptneſſe to receive Chriſt, which Love hath not.</hi> It is true, and therefore Faith onely Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth, and not Love: Thus it maketh againſt him, and not for him. Beſides with him, Faith juſtifieth as a Condition, not from its peculiar aptneſſe, and therefore Love and Repentance being Conditions, muſt ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie <hi>aequè</hi> with Faith, though not <hi>aequaliter,</hi> Faiths aptneſſe is the remote reaſon, as it is a Condition, that is the proxime and formall reaſon: Now Repentance and Love have this formall reaſon, for they are Conditions: Certainly, if <hi>Brutum</hi> were <hi>Animal rationale,</hi> he would be <hi>Homo,</hi> as well as man is. Some other minute and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Objections are alſo brought in, but they are not worthy of a conteſt.</p>
            <p>I therefore return again from this Digreſsion to the Subject in hand, which is to take notice of the great Uſefulneſs and Excellency of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter contained in this Prayer of Christs. <hi>Luther</hi> did juſtly call <hi>John</hi> the Evangeliſt for this Book, <hi>Malleus Pelagianorum,</hi> the hammer of <hi>Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians,</hi> we may adde alſo of <hi>Socinians</hi> and <hi>Arians.</hi> Hence <hi>Sixtus Senenſis</hi> ſpeaketh of ſome Heretiques called <hi>Alogi</hi> (a name that <hi>Epiphanius</hi> did justly put upon them) becauſe they rejected this Goſpel of <hi>John,</hi> and could not endure this <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>the Word,</hi> ſo often mentioned by him; What is thus ſaid of the whole Goſpel, may alſo be applied to this Prayer. For</p>
            <p>Firſt, Here is the Systeme, as it were, of moſt exact and pure Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, eſpecially the <hi>Socinian</hi> and <hi>Arminian</hi> Errours are moſt power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and evidently profligated by it; <hi>Poſſevine</hi> chargeth it under his head of Atheiſme upon the Heretiques, that <hi>Luther</hi> ſhould ſay, There was no other Goſpel but that of <hi>John,</hi> as if the Books of the other E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelists did not deſerve that Name; but till I can finde that expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in <hi>Luther,</hi> I ſhall not be ſollicitous for an anſwer; This is certain, that this very Chapter I am treating of, is enough to put to flight and conquer the Armies of the chiefeſt Heretiques; there being ſcarce any Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of weight in Religion, which may not from hence be ſtrongly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> maketh this Chapter <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> not <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a Sermon, not a Prayer, but it may have this inſtructing matter in it, though pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out prayer-wiſe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, As this Chapter is thus, the Compendium and Marrow of Divinity, ſo it is alſo the Foundation of the Miniſtry, yea and of the
<pb facs="tcp:65216:5"/>
Church alſo; For as at the Creation by that word of bleſsing, <hi>Increaſe and multiply,</hi> all things have their being, and are continued therein, ſo from the vertue and efficacie of this Prayer, the Miniſtry, the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the Church it ſelf have their exiſtence and preſervation.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Whereas the life and comfort of believers lieth in their U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with Christ, and Communion one with another. This precious truth is largely mentioned by our Saviour, which giveth occaſion to treat of a Believers Union with Chriſt, as alſo of the Unity which ought to be amongst Believers, from which Foundation we treat concerning the means to preſerve Unity, as alſo the cauſes of Diviſions amongst them, and likewiſe how farre a Forbearance and Toleration in a Church-way (for that Queſtion of a Politicall and Civil one, is not ſo perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to our Saviours words) is to be yeelded unto in reſpect of erring Brethren.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, This Prayer of Chriſt may be compared to a <hi>Land flowing with milk and honey,</hi> in reſpect of that treaſure of Conſolation which is contained therein: For as <hi>Chryſoſtome (Praefat. ad</hi> Johan.) ſaith, <hi>Though he be the Sonne of Thunder, yet his voice is ſweeter than any Melody;</hi> therefore at the <hi>13<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
               </hi> verſe he relateth, that our Saviour ſaid, <hi>Theſe things have I ſpoken in the world that my joy might be fulfilled in them.</hi> It is obſerved, that when Chriſt did in a more extraordinary and ardent manner pray unto God, he went into ſome ſecret place, and was alone; And <hi>Caſaubon</hi> leaveth it to be conſidered by the Learned <hi>(Exerc. 16. cap. 62.) Whether our Lord did not alſo pray this Prayer privately.</hi> But this expreſsion <hi>[I ſpeak theſe things in the world]</hi> doe plainly demonſtrate, that it was at leaſt ſpoken in the preſence of the Diſciples, and that for their Edification and Conſolation. Seeing therefore this is ſuch a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain for healing and refreſhing, Come with a ſpiritual thirſt to be repleniſhed thereby: Seeing here is the <hi>Honey and the Honey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comb,</hi> doe not with <hi>Jonathan taſte a little onely,</hi> but eat freely and abundantly thereof, thou wilt by a ſerious and conſtant Meditation finde this heavenly matter in Chriſts Prayer make thee heavenly alſo, and aſsimulate thee into his own likeneſſe: How vain and empty will all the Glory of the world appear to thee, when thou ſhalt be lifted up upon this Mount of Transfiguration? They that live under the Torrid Zone never feel any cold, and thou who ſhalt finde this Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Chriſt active and vigorous in thy breaſt, wilt never have cauſe to complain of that Dulneſſe, Formality and Coldneſse which many others groan under. The Lord grant that thou mayeſt finde this ſavoury Power, and experiment all Efficacie upon thy heart in the reading thereof.</p>

            <p>The Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> of all the Evangeliſts is compared to an Eagle, becauſe he treateth of the higheſt and moſt ſublime matter; For as it is commonly recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, He outliving all the other Apoſtles, there were damnable <hi>Hereticks</hi> riſen up that denied Chriſt to be God, at the Churches entreaty therefore he wrote this Book, mainly aſſerting Chriſts Godhead, and handling thoſe things eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially which the other Evangeliſts had left out, eſpecially inſiſting upon thoſe excellent diſcourſes and dialogues Chriſt had with the Phariſees; As alſo thoſe divine Inſtructions and conſolations he gave his Diſciples at his departure from them, of which the other Evangeliſts record nothing at all: Now when our Saviour had been large in inſtructing and confirming them, he bends himſelf to earneſt praier for them, that what he had ſaid might take place in their hearts, ſo that in the Chapter you may take notice of,

            <p>For the Introduction, there we have 1. The order of Chriſts Praier, and 2. the deſcription of his geſture.</p>
            <p>The Order is, <hi>Theſe words ſpake Jeſus,</hi> that is, after Chriſt had finiſhed thoſe admirable and comfortable Inſtructions, then he betakes himſelf to praier, From whence obſerve,</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">To all Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and Conſolations Praier is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for their good effect.</note>
               <hi>That to all Inſtructions and Conſolations Praier is neceſſary for their good effect.</hi> Chriſt himſelf doth not think it enough to plant, but he prays there may be a watering from above; Thus all Miniſters and all hearers are to take Chriſts way; Even as at other times we reade that Chriſt ſpent the day in Preaching, and the night in Praying; For if the Apoſtle 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.5. ſay of every creature for nouriſhment, <hi>it is ſanctified by Praier,</hi> when yet the creatures have in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a naturall ſtrength to nouriſh, how much more is this to be ſeen in the means of grace, which work not by inherent but inſtituted efficacy altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? If therefore we would have our preaching and your hearing doe any good, be powerfull to an heavenly alteration and change, then look up with your eyes to heaven; It's from God that this muſt do me good, It's from God that this muſt teach my heart; In vain is a Teacher without if there be not alſo a Teacher within, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. You ſee the Apoſtle there taking beleevers off from all Miniſters and Inſtruments, and to reſt on Jeſus Chriſt; They are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary but as Miniſters by whom we do beleeve, not as authours of our faith.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Reaſons.</hi>
               </note>Let us conſider, Why Praier is thus neceſſary in the uſe of all other means, And</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">I. On Gods part.</note>Firſt, From God in theſe reſpects.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <note place="margin">1. God is the ſole fountain and authour of all grace.</note>1. <hi>He is the ſole author and fountain of all grace</hi>; It's not the gifts or parts of Men and Angels that remove the ſtone of the heart, that can make the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered dry bones to live again, unleſſe the Spirit of God breathe upon us, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. <hi>Every good and perfect gift</hi> is ſaid to <hi>come from above,</hi> That as the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall Philoſophers ſay, The Sun and Stars are the cauſe of all the life and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection which is in theſe things below, inſomuch that without them all things would be deſtroyed; This is much more true in heavenly and ſupernaturall
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65216:17"/>
effects, therefore he is called the <hi>God of all grace, and the God of all conſolations,</hi> 2 Cor. 1.3. There is no godlineſſe, no comfort can ſtream in the heart, but from this Fountain; we lie like ſo many lumps of earth, like ſo many noiſome <hi>Lazaruſſes</hi> in the grave, till God bid us Come forth; So then to have any do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine or truth enter into thy heart, to have the Miniſtry effectuall and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful to thee, is of greater conſequence then thou art aware of. There muſt be much ſtrugling and ſtriving with God ere thou canſt behold him in his glory in the Ordinances; Thou muſt be <hi>Jacob</hi> ere thou canſt be <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as an Ancient ſaid; Wonder not, if you ſee men living in the ſame luſts, and roving in their former exceſſe of riot, though the clouds drop upon them daily, yet they are a barren wilderneſſe; Alas, all the rain in the world would not make the Earth ſpring forth and encreaſe, had not God at firſt commanded the earth to doe ſo, and certainly if God can by his Word make the dull, dead earth ſo glorious, that <hi>Solomon</hi> is in his greateſt ſtate not like the glory thereof, how much rather can he make a heavy, dull, earthly, carnall people, glorious and admirable in variety of graces, he can make them a Paradiſe who were a parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed heath; Praier therefore is neceſſary becauſe God onely hath the command over all Ordinances to bleſſe as he pleaſeth.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>On Gods part we are therefore to pray,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. That all the praiſe may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound to him.</note> 
               <hi>that ſo all the glory and praiſe in every thing may redound to him,</hi> ſo 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. <hi>that he who glorieth may glory in God only</hi>; Hence it is that as in the Old Teſtament we reade of many good wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and they were moſt of them barren, to humble them, and that they might ſee it was not their goodneſſe but Gods glory and power to give them children; So it is here, God many times cauſeth not the beſt and choiceſt Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, to be fruitfull in converſion of others, to be able to ſay, <hi>Behold I and the Children which thou haſt given me,</hi> that hereby all the glory may be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to God onely.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Therefore after all doctrinall Inſtructions is <hi>Praier to be uſed,</hi>
               <note place="margin">3. Becauſe God in anger many times doth blaſt the Word to men for their ſins.</note> becauſe <hi>God in anger many times for mens ſins doth blaſt the Word to them,</hi> doth not give them a tender and an underſtanding heart; Oh then how much is he to be ſought to that hath the key of all mens hearts, that <hi>openeth and none can ſhut that ſhutteth and none can open,</hi> Rev. 3.7. Obſerve that expreſſion, it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noteth Gods abſolute Soveraignty, that all the devils in hell, and all the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Inſtruments in the world are not able to hinder the good effect that God hath appointed ſuch a Sermon, or ſuch a Miniſtry to produce; What then, though we ſow all the day long, though we exhort, entreat and beſeech, yet if God be angry with thee, and will let thee alone in thy ſins, thou ſhalt die and be damned in thy obſtinacy and unbelief: Though <hi>Solomon</hi> with all his wiſedom were here to perſwade thee, thou wouldſt be wilful in thy iniquities; <hi>The ſeeing eye, and the hearing ear</hi> are both ſaid to be <hi>the gift of God,</hi> Pro. 20.12. and what a terrible expreſſion is that to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> where after all the miracles and wonderfull works that God had done before them, it's ſaid, God had not given them an heart to underſtand till that day, <hi>Deut.</hi> 19.4. and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous is that place <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6. thrice repeated in the New Teſtament, of <hi>blinding their eyes, and hardening their hearts, leſt they ſhould underſtand and be convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>; Who then is there but muſt neceſſarily conclude, that God is earneſtly to be praied unto, leſt he be left to a ſpirit of ſlumber and giddineſſe, leſt God ſware in his wrath, that no preaching ſhall ever do thee good? How did <hi>Paul</hi> rejoice to be at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> becauſe an <hi>effectual and large door was opened to him,</hi> 1 Cor. 16 9 It was opened by God, the Miniſters themſelves,<note place="margin">II.

            <p>Secondly, <hi>If we conſider the nature of all Preaching, and what kinde of cauſe the Word is of converſion, that will alſo compell to Praier.</hi> It's diſputed among
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:65216:18"/>
Divines what kinde of cauſality the Preaching of the Word hath in regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating of men. I ſhall not now lanch into that deep Ocean, but two waies are wholly to be denied.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <note place="margin">1. The Word converts not neceſſarily.</note>1. The Preaching of the Word doth not convert <hi>neceſſarily,</hi> as the Fire doth neceſſarily burn, the Sun doth neceſſarily ſhine; No, for then where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the Word is preached, all their eyes would be opened, all their hearts ſoftened that hear it, but experience doth wofully confute this; We ſee Chriſt who preached <hi>as one having authority,</hi> and <hi>no man ever ſpake like him,</hi> yet he threw in his Net and catched few fiſh, yea, we doe not reade of ſo many converted by his Miniſtry as by ſome of the Apoſtles.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <note place="margin">2. Nor as a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural cauſe.</note>2. As it doth not work neceſſarily, ſo neither as a <hi>natural cauſe,</hi> that hath inward power to produce its effects; As the fire hath an inherent ſtrength to burn, the Earth an inherent power to bring forth fruit, or as a two edged Sword pierceth: For though the Word be compared to it, yet</p>
            <p n="3">
               <note place="margin">3. Its efficacy is only by Gods Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion according to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and good pleaſure.</note>3. <hi>This efficacy is only by Inſtitution, according to the command and good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of God</hi>: Of it ſelf it worketh no more then Exhortations to a dead man, but when cloathed with divine authority, then it beateth down every thing that oppoſeth it ſelf; If then we are bound to pray to God that he would make naturall cauſes, though with ſo much inherent proneneſſe, to cauſe their effects, as that our bread may nouriſh us, our cloaths may warm us, how much rather when there is no ſuch naturall efficiency; <hi>If man lives not by bread alone, but by every word proceeding out of Gods mouth,</hi> much leſſe is man converted, enlightned, or regenerated by Preaching of the Word only, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the power of God manifeſted from heaven; Yet oh the ſecurity, the ſenceleſneſſe of moſt people herein, They do not earneſtly contend in praier with God before they come hither; What earneſt wraſtlings and ſtrivings haſt thou had with God to day, that thy ſoul might be put into an heavenly tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell, and Chriſt be formed in thee? This is the true reaſon why you heare your ſelves into damnation, and we preach you into greater and greater ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall judgements daily, becauſe few are diligent in praying for a bleſſing upon that which ſhall be delivered to them.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">III. Becauſe of mans inability to what is good.</note>In the third place, <hi>After doctrinal Inſtruction there is great need of praier to God, becauſe of the utter inſufficiency and inability that is in every man to what is good</hi>: Such is the contrariety and enmity in every mans heart againſt Truth preached, that we had need pray and pray again that God would open our eyes, and ſoften our hearts; The Scripture in ſeverall places doth deſcribe mans Impotency, and his utter averſeneſſe to what is holy; He is a Tyger, a Lion, a wilde Bear, he is a meer briar and bramble; There cannot be any good wrought in him, till God make dead men to riſe out of their ſinnes; We doe not hear Sermons as the Heathens did their morall Orations, for they had ſome imbred ſtrength to doe thoſe things that were civilly good, but when we have to doe with ſupernatural things, there all muſt be planted in us: There is nothing in us to love or embrace it, yea, whatſoever we are, think, or will, it all riſeth up in rebellion againſt God; and certainly if the godly them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, though endowed already with an heavenly life do yet earneſtly pray that God would open their eyes, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 119. That he would <hi>quicken them,</hi> and make them to grow up in an higher ſtature, how much more do men deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of Gods Spirit need this help, yea, we may take notice, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.18. that when the childe of God is fully compleated with the whole Armour of God, he hath his helmet, his ſhield, his breſtplate upon him, yet he muſt not truſt to this, but after all this he is to pray alwaies with all praier and ſupplication; So that you ſee in all holy exerciſes, we are to be as the little childe who lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth only upon his Father, we are like the Fowl, when we have drunk down a little, preſently to lift up our heads to heaven, that it may work on us.</p>

               </note> and you in hearing what we ought to do, know it muſt be Praier that will ſanctifie every Sermon; According as thou haſt laid up Praier beforehand, ſo do thou expect to ſpeed; What a wofull thing will it be if God make this Heaven braſſe and iron, theſe helps of ſalvation furtherances to damnation, and all becauſe thou doſt not carefully ſeek to him. Canſt thou pray in other things and not here? Is not every Sermon of eternall conſequence? Is not heaven or hell delivered at this time, why then are we ſuch ſtupid blocks as not to lay faſt hold on God, and ſay, I will not let thee go till thou giveſt me a bleſſing; It's taken up as a ſad Queſtion, Why in theſe latter daies the Word preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed makes no more wonderfull works? At firſt Propagation of the Goſpel, ſo many fiſh were caught in the Net, that it was ready to break; And at the firſt Reformation out of Popery, the Kingdom of God ſuffered violence, but now he that is prophane is prophane ſtill, the blinde are blinde ſtill, the proud proud ſtill: What is the matter? Is not the Word of God as powerfull as ever? Is not the Lords arm as ſtrong as ever? Yes, but the zeal of people is grown cold; There are not ſuch fervent praiers, ſuch high eſteems of the means of grace; Men do not beſiege Heaven, giving God no reſt day or night till he come with ſalvation into their ſouls, and truly the Spirit of prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is a ſure fore-runner of ſpirituall mercies to be beſtowed, <hi>Optat dare qui mandat orare,</hi> when God will bleſſe the Word and Miniſtery to thee, he will ſtir up thy appetite, make thee hungry and thirſty, fill thee with daily pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings after his grace. And thus much of the order.</p>
            <p>I proceed to the geſture uſed in praier, <hi>He lifted up his eyes to heaven</hi>: In the Scripture we reade of ſeverall geſtures in praier, one of the Publican clean contrary, <hi>He caſt his eyes upon the earth,</hi> and that did ariſe from the great and reall ſence he had of his unworthineſſe, and of the multitude of ſins that were upon him, but yet that which is moſt commendable and indeed moſt natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, is to <hi>lift up the eyes to Heaven,</hi> the place of Gods ſpeciall preſence, though he be alſo every where, for the eye in this caſe ſhould be the demonſtration of the heart, <hi>Cor in oculis,</hi> that if it were poſſible we would both in ſoul and body, while praying, be lifted up into heaven; Now how our Saviour, who was God as well as man, could pray, and what kinde of Praier this was, will hereafter be cleared. From this geſture Obſerve,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That all our Praiers ſhould come from a ſpiritual and heavenly heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It's the very definition of praier, that it's <hi>Elevatio mentis ad Deum,</hi>
               <note place="margin">

Praier is the Key to open hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, if that be empty and unprofitable, how canſt thou be repleniſhed? You ask, and pray, and have not; <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.2. No ſins are removed, no ſpirituall mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies are beſtowed on thee, and all becauſe thy praier is not heavenly;<note place="margin">The requiſites to ſpiritual praier.</note> Now theſe things make an heavenly Praier.</p>

The Spirits enabling and moving the ſoul to this duty.</note> It is the Spirit of God that helpeth againſt our infirmities, and enableth us with <hi>groans unutterable.</hi> The heart is but as ſo much dull earth, till the Spirit of God inflame thee; Thy praier is a body without a ſoul, if there be words but not Gods Spirit in the heart; But oh what ſhall we then think of moſt mens praiers that have nothing but cuſtome and formality in them: No won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

            <p n="2">
               <note place="margin">2. An heavenly heart.</note>2. <hi>An heavenly Praier muſt have an heavenly heart,</hi> that which pants after and delights in heavenly things, but <hi>Pſ.</hi> 4.6. <hi>Many ſay, Who will ſhew us any good?</hi> Every one can pray for earthly and temporall good things, for health, ſtrength, peace, and outward plenty, but few with <hi>David, Lift thou up the light of thy countenance.</hi> In the Lords Praier we are firſt to pray for thoſe ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all things that relate to Gods glory, before we are to ask for our temporall comforts; yea, while we pray for temporall mercies we are to do it in a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly manner, for this end, that we may be more inſtrumental to Gods glory, and be brought nearer to him; <hi>Difficile eſt erare, quia difficile eſt deſiderare,</hi> ſaid <hi>Aquinas.</hi> It is a very hard thing to deſire heavenly things, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as hard to pray for them; how happy then is it when the matter praied for and the frame of the heart are both heavenly; Now like Chriſt he is gone up to the Mount, and praieth alone, he is above all earthly things, alone with God himſelf.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <note place="margin">3. When the heart and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified and made fit for the enjoyment of God.</note>3. <hi>That Praier is heavenly when the heart and affections are purified and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied fit for the enjoyment of God</hi>: In praier we have an immediate approach un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to and fellowſhip with God; There cannot be greater honour vouchſafed unto a creature then to be admitted to pray to him, but who is ſufficient for this duty? The Heathens did often preſſe this, that God was to be worſhiped <hi>prae mente,</hi> but the Apoſtle more divinely, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.8. <hi>Lifting up holy or pure hands,</hi> Mat. 6. <hi>Bleſſed are the pure in heart for they ſhall ſee God</hi>; A ſore eye with corrupt humours is not fit to look on a bright object, and truly in all our praiers we ſhould think nothing ſo comely as to have heavenly hearts for heavenly work; If the godly mans converſation even in buying, ſelling, and all other lawfull emploiments, is to be heavenly, much more in praier, then there ſhould be <hi>Sabbatum mentis</hi> the reſt of the Soul, there ſhould be no diſtractions, no debaſings of it by earthly affections, we ſhould have a garden readily dreſſed for the Spouſe to walk in; If Chriſts body was to be in a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre where none ever lay btfore, how much rather will whole Chriſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide in a clean heart; The devil would not come into his Lodgings but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were ſwept and ready garniſhed for him, how much rather will Chriſt expect that the ſoul ſhould be in an holy and heavenly manner fitted for to enjoy him.</p>

Thus the ſoul that is heavenly in Praier to God, leaveth an excellent and ſpiritual luſtre upon all his actions, his conferences, his converſation ſpeaks the mighty glory of this praier; oh what godly man may not fall down with ſhame and confuſion to think how far ſhort he comes of this heavenly praier.</p>

            <p>THE Introduction hath already been diſpatched, which contained the Order and Method of Chriſts Praier, as alſo his geſture; We now come to the praier it ſelf, <hi>he ſaid, Father,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>To open this Conſider, That Praier is of two ſorts,</p>
            <p>Either 1. <hi>Mentall,</hi> which is only in the ſoul and ſpirit, for God being a Spirit and omniſcient, knoweth all the thoughts and deſires of the heart; Thus <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>the ſpirits of juſt men perfected in heaven</hi> do pray, <hi>The ſouls under the Altar cried for an holy</hi> avenging on their enemies, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6.9.</p>
            <p>Or elſe there is 2. a <hi>vocall</hi> Praier, when our deſires are manifeſted by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſigns of words, and thus Chriſts praier here is a vocall praier, neither may ſuch kinde of praying be thought needleſſe,<note place="margin">Why we ſhould pray with the tongue.</note> for we do not uſe words as if God needed theſe ſigns, in which ſence <hi>Eliah</hi> derided <hi>Baals</hi> Prieſts, bidding them <hi>cry aloud,</hi> it may be <hi>Baal</hi> was <hi>aſleep,</hi> or in a <hi>journey,</hi> 1 King. 8.27. but hereby to excite and ſtir up our affections, for the ſoul and body do mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally help each other, and partly becauſe we are to glorifie God with our body, and with our ſoul, and laſtly what is ſtrongly in the heart cannot but
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:65216:20"/>
empty it ſelf in words: Hence are thoſe expreſſions, <hi>I cried unto the Lord with a loud voice,</hi> ſo that a vocall praier is commanded as well as a mentall, only in that we muſt remember there ought to be a threefold attention, firſt unto God the object unto whom we pray that our thoughts be not diſtracted. 2.<note place="margin">In vocal praier there muſt be a threefold at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention.</note> To the matter that it be lawfull and according to Gods will. 3. To the words, that they be ſober, grave and decent in ſo religious a duty. And thus much from that expreſſion, Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">How Chriſt being God could pray.</note>In the next place let us conſider, how Chriſt could pray, for being God it ſeemeth praier is as incompatible to him as to God; The anſwer is in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of his divine nature, ſo he could not pray, but in his humane nature and as he was in the ſtate of humiliation, ſo he did not only pray, but he praied wirh <hi>agonies and ſtrong cries,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.7. for in this conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration he was capable of many mercies which God did beſtow upon him, and alſo upon all the Elect, for he praied for them alſo, yea, he did not only pray in the ſtate of humiliation, but in his glorified eſtate; Now whileſt he is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted on his Throne, <hi>he makes interceſſion for us,</hi> Heb. 7.15. 1 Joh. 2.1. Though this Interceſſion in Heaven is not in that humble way of ſupplication, as while he was in the fleſh, but a preſenting of his ſufferings and obedience to the Father, with an earneſt will that all his Elect ſhould partake the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits thereof; But of this Point, how Chriſt could be ſaid to pray, more in its due time. This praier Chriſt powred forth, ſo far as it relateth to the Church of God and all beleevers, is part of his Prieſtly office, for the Prieſt was to doe two things, firſt to pray, then to offer a ſacrifice; Now Chriſt in this Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter he praieth and afterwards offereth up himſelf an holy and unſpotted ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for the ſins of his people, and as the High-Prieſt was to carry the names of the twelve Tribes in his breaſt to preſent them to God, ſo doth Chriſt here, he preſents all his children unto God the Father by this praier; There is no godly man ſo mean, ſo weak, ſo inconſiderable but he is commended unto the Father, and may juſtly expect the fruit of this praier.</p>
            <p>

                  <hi>Doct.</hi> That all the godly are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the benefit of Chriſts Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatory praier.</note>
               <hi>That all the Children of God are under the fruit and benefit of Chriſts Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory praier</hi>: Take up theſe two forementioned places, 1 <hi>Joh</hi> 2.1. <hi>If any ſin, we have an Advocate with the Father</hi>; Here is ſuppoſed that upon every ſinne we commit, there is an inditement, an impleading of us, an accuſing of us unto God; Thou thinkeſt nothing of thy ſinnes when committed, they are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently out of thy minde, but oh the charge and Inditement that is againſt thee before God, only the godly they have Chriſt an Advocate, he dosh conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pleade for them, he takes their parts and he is ſure to prevail; What trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of comfort are here for the godly, when thou art not thinking or mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thy own ſelf, Chriſt in heaven is pleading for thee; It's good to have this Friend in the Court of heaven, ſo <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25. <hi>He everliveth to make interceſſion for them</hi>; he ever-liveth, and this he attends unto, When thou art ſleeping and canſt not pray for thy ſelf, he maketh Interceſſion for thee; So that Chriſt though exalted and made glorious in heaven, hath not laid aſide his love and earneſt affections for thy good; But as <hi>Joſeph</hi> when lifted up in <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Court ſent for his Father and Brethren to give them the good things of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gipt</hi>; Thus it is here, Chriſt ſaid, he went to his Father to provide manſion places in heaven for them, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.2. Oh the unſpeakable dignity and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to be under Chriſts Interceſſion; If we do ſo much eſteem the praier of a godly man on earth, and the effectuall praier of one righteous man pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaileth much. The excelltncy of praier appearing in that it only is compared to Frankincenſe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. &amp; <hi>cap.</hi> 6. ſignifying as this doth recreate and refreſh man, ſo doth a true right praier pleaſe God;) what then will the praier of Chriſt himſelf do? If a <hi>Job,</hi> If a <hi>Daniel,</hi> If a <hi>Moſes</hi> could do ſo much in praier, when yet their praier needed Chriſts praier for acceptation and impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:65216:20"/>
how prevalent muſt Chriſts praier be for his beleevers?</p>
            <p>To open this Doctrine, Conſider</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>The matter of Chriſts Praier for his Children,</hi> and that is,</p>
            <p n="1">1. For the accompliſhing of all grace here and glory hereafter;<note place="margin">I. The matter of Chriſts praier for his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</note> There is no heavenly or ſpirituall mercy but Chriſt hath praied for it; Thou doſt not only pray for it, (alas what are thy praiers?) but Chriſt hath praied for it, thy converſion and ſanctification is praied for; There is no man to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted by the Word but Chriſt praied for that mans converſion, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.20.<note place="margin">1. All grace.</note> It was ſaid of <hi>Auſtin,</hi> becauſe his Mother <hi>Monica</hi> praied ſo earneſtly about him, that it was impoſſible a childe of ſo many praiers ſhould periſh, but that is not neceſſary, though all the men in the world ſhould pray for ſuch a mans converſion, it might not be, only we may ſay, It's impoſſible a childe of Chriſts praiers and tears ſhould periſh.</p>
            <p>Again, 2. <hi>Pardon and forgiveneſſe of ſinne, and that as oft as it is committed is the matter of his prayer</hi>: We have an Advocate, as you heard. Alas,<note place="margin">2. Pardon of ſin.</note> upon the committing of any ſinne, if there were no more ſtrength to do them away then is in the praiers and tears of the godly, if all the guilt lay upon them to diſcharge, how inſupportable would it be? but there is no ſinne at any time committed by thee, if repented of and forgiven, but Chriſt hath praied that it may be forgiven thee: ſo then though there be weakneſſe, unbelief, and dullneſſe in thy praiers, yet there was no fault to be found <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n Chriſts praiers; In all thy agonies, deſertions and temptations, pleade the Interceſſion of Chriſt;</p>
            <p n="3">3. Further, Another main ſpirituall mercy praied for, is preſervation from ſin, <hi>v.</hi> 15. <hi>I pray not thou ſhouldeſt take them out of the world,</hi>
               <note place="margin">3.</note> 
               <hi>but that thou ſhouldeſt keep them from the evil</hi>; Oh admirable and neceſſary praier; we are in the world as in an infected Hoſpitall, as in a fiery furnace: Now to be here and not diſeaſed, not to be burned therein, is the wonderfull expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Gods power and goodneſſe, for this River to run into the Sea, and not to partake of the ſalt taſte thereof is beyond expreſſion, Chriſt hath not prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that we ſhould have no afflictions or troubles in the world, but that we ſhould be kept from the evil of them; He did not pray for <hi>Peter</hi> that he ſhould not have wofull and ſad temptations, but that his <hi>faith might not fail</hi> in the midſt of them; O what a comfortable cordiall may it be in times of great commotions and violent temptations! how do the godly fear leſt their ſtrength ſhould fail them, leſt one time or other they ſhould yeeld to ſinne, and be overwhelmed? Now in the midſt of all theſe fears Chriſt hath praied for thee as well as for <hi>Peter,</hi> that thy faith may not fail: Inſomuch that we may ſay, Chriſts praier for beleevers is all their hope and foundation; In ſome ſad ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>igences how carefull are we to have the praiers of all Gods people, to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred in ſuch and ſuch a Congregation, but if all the Churches in the world ſhould pray for a man, it would not amount to ſo much as Chriſts praier; therefore let the godly comfort one another with theſe things.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, <hi>He hath praied for their glorification</hi>; Thus he praied,<note place="margin">4. Glorification.</note> that they may be one even as he and the father are one, and that they be where he is, <hi>viz.</hi> that they may enjoy that glory which Chriſt had purchaſed for them; Therefore he is called the <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> Job. 11.25. becauſe he will raiſe up ſuch at the laſt day: The body though dead and conſumed to aſhes ſhall not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies be in the grave, neither ſhall the ſoul have ſuch rags and deformities upon it continually, but ſhall be cloathed with glorious robes; Thus you ſee the chief and main matter of Chriſts praier, not ſo much earthly and tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall things, as heavenly: for although Chriſt did comfort his Diſciples even in earthly ſtraits, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.25. that they had a Father in Heaven, and if he did provide for all the creatures in the world, they might much rather be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded of his care to them, and <hi>Paul</hi> argued <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. he gave his only Son for
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:65216:21"/>
them, how ſhall he not give all things elſe? Yet the great things that Chriſt before his ſufferings thought fit to commend unto God, were ſpirituall and heavenly benefits. And that is the firſt conſideration, The matter of Chriſts Praier.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">II. The nature of his praier by way of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.</note>Secondly, <hi>Take notice of the nature of this Praier, it's by way of Mediation</hi>; It's a Mediatory Praier, and ſo differs from all the praiers of other men: As they are bare meer men, ſo their praiers are bare meer praiers; There is no merit, no mediation in thee, but Chriſts praier is of a farre more tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent nature, Even as the bloud of the Martyrs came farre ſhort of Chriſts; Their bloud was not expiatory, it was not by way of a Sacrifice for ſinnes, whereas Chriſts was; Thus there is a vaſt difference between praiers and prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, God may regard one mans praier more then anothers, it may be more effectuall, as in that ſuppoſition, though <hi>Daniel</hi> and <hi>Job</hi> ſtood and praied, they ſhould not be heard; <hi>Job,</hi> you know was commanded to pray for his Friends, and his praier was accepted of more then theirs, and <hi>Daniel</hi> was ſaid to be a man <hi>greatly beloved,</hi> becauſe his praiers were ſo readily heard; Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the praier of many, or a Church, is more prevalent then the praier of one ſingle perſon; So a Praier from one in office as a Miniſter, is more then of one in a private condition: but yet the praier of Chriſt as in the office of a Mediatour doth farre ſurmount all. So then in Chriſts praier we are eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to look to the Mediatory power, to the impetratory efficacy of it; It's not a meer ſupplication as ours are, but a powerfull obtaining of what is deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; His praier can be no more refuſed then his bloud, they both are in the ſame nature, they go along under the ſame reſpect, his bloud may as well be without advantage as his praier; The high-Prieſts praier for the people was of greater concernment for the people then their own praiers; I tell thee all thy own praiers are not of that conſequence to thee as Chriſts praier is, all Mediatory and impetratory efficacy is from that.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">III. The dignity of the Perſon praying.</note>Thirdly, <hi>Conſider the dignity of the Perſon who did pray for beleevers, and thereby cometh an infinite efficacy and worth to it.</hi> Chriſt who praied for us being God and man, in regard of his divine nature, there cometh an infinite worth upon his praier, his praier is like himſelf, and from this account it is, that it is <hi>meritorious</hi> with God, that it is juſt with God to grant him his Requeſts; his Supplications are put up in his own name, he needeth no Mediatour, there is none to make way for his acceptance with God, ſo that this Meditation affords unſpeakable conſolation, though all thy praiers and duties be nothing worth, yet Chriſts is of infinite value: The dignity and merit whereby any good cometh to us, is not for our praiers but for Chriſts; Certainly the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God do not live ſo chearfully upon this conſideration as they ought; They are careful to pour out their own praiers, but not by faith to reſt on Chriſts; What needeſt thou fear who canſt bring praiers of infinite merit? The Lord Chriſt hath praied that I might have this mercy; he hath praied that this grace ſhould be vouchſafed unto me; What fault can be found with Chriſt? What blame or imperfection is to be ſeen or found in him? how can Chriſt be denied in juſtice? It is his right to have his Requeſts an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">IV. His relation to God the Father.</note>Fourthly, <hi>Conſider the reſpect and relation Chriſt ſtands in towards God the Father,</hi> And then you will ſtill ſay, his praier is of great concernment to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, Now his relation is, <hi>the only Son of God, and dearly beloved by him, This is my well-beloved Son in whom I am well-pleaſed,</hi> Mat. 3.17. So that his praiers are heard unqueſtionably upon a twofold ground, the one of <hi>juſtice</hi> becauſe infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite in worth, the other of <hi>love</hi> becauſe the only begotten Son; This <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.7. He is ſaid, while he praied, to be heard in what he feared, and <hi>Joh.</hi> 11.12. Chriſt thanks the Father that he <hi>heard him alwaies,</hi> and often doth he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:65216:21"/>
that the Father loveth him the Sonne, and that the Father and the Son are one. This alſo is very comfortable to meditate upon, Thou haſt the prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of him who is the only begotten of the Father, whom the Father heareth alwaies, and to whom he denieth nothing, if we are able to ſay, Lord, this is not my praier only, This is not my deſire only, but its the requeſt of Chriſt ſo beloved of thee, then thou maiſt juſtly beleeve thou ſhalt be accepted of; O Lord, though I have no lovelineſſe, no comelineſſe, yet Chriſt hath; Some have doubted whether Chriſt was heard in every thing he praied for,<note place="margin">Whether Chriſt was heard in every thing he prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for, or no.</note> and they inſtance in his praier, that <hi>the cup might paſſe from him,</hi> but that was only conditionall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If it be thy will, and therefore he added, Not my will but thine be done; That which he abſolutely praied for, was Gods ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and preſervation of him, as alſo the raiſing him out of the grave. That which ſeemeth to have gteat difficulty is his praier, <hi>Luke</hi> 23.34. <hi>Father, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give them, for they know not what they do,</hi> but of the efficacy of this we need not doubt of, becauſe the Phariſees and others they ſinned againſt their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and conſcience, and for ſuch Chriſt praied not, but others that knew not what they did, many of them were converted afterwards, and did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve in him, whom they had pierced, ſo that we need not doubt of ſpeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when we bring Chriſt with us. Hence <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.24. <hi>Whatſoever you ſhall ask the Father in my Name, he will give it you</hi>; If we were to draw nigh in our Name, If we did appear in our own Name, we might juſtly look for anger in ſtead of mercy, but God is not angry with Chriſt, he doth not frown upon Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">V. Chriſts praier had all the qualifications requiſite to acceptation.</note> 
               <hi>The praier of Chriſt had all thoſe internall qualifications that are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to acceptation</hi>: For firſt, There was holy faith and confidence, the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face is <hi>Father,</hi> which is not a bare Title, but an expreſſion from inward affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, indeed Chriſt was not capable of juſtifying faith, he was too perfect a ſubject to need ſuch a grace, yet as the habit of faith doth include no imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in the ſubject, but a full dependance and affiance on God, ſo Chriſt did beleeve, and in this ſence he cried, <hi>My God, My God, why haſt thou forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken me?</hi> My God, My God, were acts of fiduciall dependance; As for repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and ſorrow for ſinne, which is requiſite in all our praiers, ſuch alſo Chriſt was not capable of, but then for love and zeal to God, for heavenly affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Sea is not fuller of water then his ſoul was of ſuch enlargements; No diſtraction, no deadneſſe, no imperfection did cleave to his praier, but as he himſelf was without ſinne, ſo alſo was his praier; Beſides the extrinſecall dignity and worth of Chriſts praier there was an inherent perfection and full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of all graces in him: Oh then though the godly labour and groan un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der manifold weakneſſes; Their praiers are ſo imperfect that they need to be praied over again, and confeſſion is requiſite for our imperfect confeſſion, yet remember the perfection of Chriſts praiers, There was no ſpot, no blemiſh in this Sacrifice of his lips. At the end of thy praier, when thy heart ſmiteth thee for thy roving thoughts, thy dulneſſe, thy diſtractions, comfort thy ſelf with this, there was no ſuch defect in Chriſts praier; Chriſts praier was like that curious confection and ointment, which had ſo many precious ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents in it.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, <hi>Conſider this Praier of Chriſts had that generall nature in it,</hi>
               <note place="margin">VI. A condition or medium of good things. Why Praier is needfull not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding Gods know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeableneſs</note> 
               <hi>which all our praiers have, to be a condition and</hi> medium <hi>to bring about the good things we deſire:</hi> For ſome have diſputed about praier, What uſe is there of it, ſeeing God knoweth all things before we ask, and he is unchangeable, our praiers cannot alter his purpoſe; To this it's anſwered, That our praiers are not to acquaint God with that he knew not, or to change his will, only God who hath decreed to do ſuch things, he hath appointed praier as a condition or means for the accompliſhment of them; Even as God hath ordained the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:65216:22"/>
earth to bring forth fruit, but it muſt be tilled and ſown, and as mankinde is to be multiplied, but by marriage, ſo good things are appointed for the godly but by praier, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.7. This is therefore called the golden chain reaching from earth to heaven, <hi>Aſcendit precatio, deſcendit miſeratio</hi>; and for this end is both a command of praier and a gracious promiſe to it, ſo that he who prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not preſumeth groſly, if he expect the fullfilling of any good thing to him; As it is thus with praier in the general ſo alſo with Chriſts praier, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever Chriſt was to purchaſe at Gods hand for his people, the ſame he was to pray for, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 2.8. <hi>Ask of me and I will give thee the Heathen for thine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance,</hi> And thus in this Chapter he praieth for that glory which yet was from the beginning appointed for him, ſo that Chriſts Praier was a ſpeciall means to bring about all thoſe admirable mercies promiſed to his people.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">VII. Chriſts praier ſanctifieth our praiers.</note>Seventhly, <hi>Take notice of this, that this Praier of Chriſt ſanctifieth all our Praiers</hi>; They become accepted of through him, He is the Altar upon which the incenſe of the Churches praiers is offeted, <hi>Rev.</hi> 8.4. As our tears need waſhing in his bloud, ſo our praiers need Chriſts praier, he praied that our praiers may be received; There is not any one Praier could ever aſcend to heaven were it not for Chriſts Interceſſion; The Popiſh doctrine therefore is very injurious to Chriſt, which inventeth other treaſures beſides the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of Chriſt; They tell us of a treaſure or bank of praiers, which may be applied to this or that neceſſitous perſon; They tell us of other Mediators in heaven beſides Chriſt, Mediators not of expiation but interceſſion, whereas you ſee it's Chriſts expiation and interceſſion that go together to work our redemption.</p>
            <p>But if Chriſts praier be thus all in all, what need we pray, are not our prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ſuperfluous?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> No, for they are not to that end which Chriſts was, not for merit or mediation; Even as though Chriſt ſuffered for our ſinnes, yet we alſo are afflicted, but not for that end, ſo our praiers are for other ends, to ſet up God, to debaſe our ſelves, to quicken up our graces, to give us an holy Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and fellowſhip with him, to ſhew our obedience to his command, who doth in ſo ſpeciall a manner require this duty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe,</hi> Are the people of God under the benefit of Chriſts praier, then how happy and bleſſed are they, what can be denied them? There is no fear of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their requeſts granted, for God looks upon them and Chriſt as one my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall perſon, as the head and members; Who is able to preach of this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject? It is too glorious, Chriſt is in heaven making Interceſſion for thee; Wo unto thee every day, every hour, Were it not for this Advocate, wo to thy own praiers, though never ſo laudable, were they not put up in Chriſts Name; Oh how little do the people of God run to this Fountain when their hearts are like a dry wilderneſſe; This is indeed the Key of heaven that opens it for thee and thy duties, if not for my ſake, yet for Chriſts ſake, Though I am unworthy yet Chriſt is worthy to be heard; But oh the terrible eſtate of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men, <hi>I pray not for the world,</hi> They have no benefit in this Mediation.</p>

Hence Chriſt <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. and <hi>Mat.</hi> 7, 11. laieth all the ground of confidence and hope to ſpeed on this, becauſe he is our Father, an heavenly Father, farre above all earthly Fathers; <hi>Nemo tam Pater,</hi> as one in another caſe; I need not tell you that God is a Father, either by <hi>Creation,</hi> in which ſence <hi>Paul</hi> alloweth that of the Poet, <hi>We are his Offspring</hi>; for this it makes not any thing to confidence in Praier, for ſo the devils and wicked men had their being from God; But 2. He is a Father by <hi>grace,</hi> by adoption, and reconciliation through Chriſt; This is the relation that ſweetens all, This is that which makes us confident he cannot or will not deny any thing that is good to us; When the Prodigal Sonne came with this Title in his mouth, <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>

It's blaſphemy, and an high diſhonour to God to think ſo. No, the Scripture telleth us of another Father to ſuch, <hi>Ye âre of your Father the devil,</hi> Joh. 8.44. There are many may ſay, Our Father which art in hell, not which art in heaven; This I would preſſe upon you that you may not blaſpheme God by calling him Father, when you do the works of the devil; If children only and not dogs muſt eat the meat on the Table, much more muſt they only be taken into the Fathers boſome; The Scripture will inform you that none may preſume to take this excellent Title into his mouth, unleſſe he ſhew his filiall fear and obedience. <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.6. <hi>If I be a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther where is mine honour.</hi> 1 Pet. 1.15. <hi>If ye call on the Father, paſſe the time of your ſojourning here in fear</hi>; Hence it is reſolved by <hi>Auſtin,</hi> that none but a juſt and righteous man may pray the Lords Praier, becauſe God is not a Father to any but thoſe that walk holily; Oh that this might ſtrike to the very heart of every ungodly man, Thou hopeſt in thy praiers, and truſteſt in thy praiers, when yet thou haſt no right to call God thy Father; He owneth no ſuch ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies as thou art for his Sonne.</p>

The ſtate of Sonſhip is pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed by Chriſt.</note>Secondly, <hi>This ſweet relation of Sonſhip to God the Father is purchaſed at a dear rate by Chriſt</hi>; He ſhed his precious bloud that we might be put into ſo happy a relation; We that were afar off are made neer by him: Hence it is that Chriſt is the Elder brother, the Heir, and we made coheirs with him, ſo that we had nothing to do with God in any comfortable way, we could not have praied to him, but had been like the devil in hell, had not Chriſt pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed this ſure and comfortable condition for us; It coſts the mother much ere ſhe be mother of a childe; In ſorrow ſhe was to bring forth, but Chriſt

Among Brethren what envy is there apt to be, yea, what murthers have been committed by one brother upon another, that they might ſolely enjoy the dignity and great eſtate. but how farre was Chriſt from this, who though only beloved of the Father, and heir to all glory, yet grudgeth not to take in others to a copartnerſhip, well then, This word Father, or to be able to call God Father coſt Chriſt dear, even more then to make a world, for there was but a word, here were great ſufferings.</p>

               <hi>He hath ſent the Spirit of his Sonne into our hearts, crying Abba Father.</hi> Although it be eaſie for a preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuous ſelf-juſtifying man to call God Father, yet take the afflicted mourner for ſinne, who is ſenſible of the great diſhonour he puts upon God, it's the hardeſt thing in the world to think God is a Father to him, becauſe therefore it is ſo great a work, God ſends his Spirit into our hearts that enableth us to cry boldly, vehemently, and notwithſtanding all oppoſition, Abba, Father; Where then we would uſe this compellation with power and life, with ſucceſſe and heavenly advantage, there the Spirit of God muſt inflame the heart, there all our ſervile fears and tormenting doubts muſt be removed; Now who but the Spirit of God can command theſe windes and waves to be ſtill.

If then God be a Father, if thou maiſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude on this, then expect every thing elſe; Now this is a great ſinne in the children of God, they doe not improve this relation; They do not think with themſelves, behold, I am a Father, I am a Mother, will my bowels let me deny my poor children (if afflicted) any thing that I can give them? why then ſhall I have ſuch low thoughts of God?

As men that are pulling any weight, the more they feel it coming, the more earneſt they are in pulling. This divine hope puts wings to the ſoul, addeth legges to its journey; Indeed a bold preſumption that God will vouchſafe him the matter of our requeſts is careleſſe of praier, becauſe that looketh for the end without the means, but an holy confidence that God will give us the good things we want, but by earneſt and fervent praier, that makes the godly ſoul

Chriſt had an hour of ſuffering and paſſions, ſo that all the endeavours to take away his life could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail till that time came, yea, and Chriſt himſelf before his time came hid himſelf, and went from place to place to avoid death; whereas when that hour was come, he willingly gave up himſelf to be a Sacrifice. <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.30. <hi>They ſought to take him, but no man laid hands on him, becauſe his hour was not yet come,</hi> So <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8.20. Laſtly, There is the hour of his glorification upon his paſſions and ſufferings, and that is meant here, <hi>Father, the hour is come, glorifie thy Sonne</hi>; although indeed this hour may comprehend both his Sufferings and his glory.</p>
            <p>Doct. <hi>That God in his wiſedom doth appoint times and ſeaſons both of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens afflictions and their mercies</hi>: They fall not out by chance,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Doct.</hi> That God doth appoint times and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for his great works.</note> they come not at unawares, but God hath decreed the particular times and ſeasons, before which they cannot come, and in which time they are ſure to come: The time of <hi>Iſraels</hi> Captivity was ſeventy years, Though all the godly on earth had praied to God, there would not have been a ſhortning of that time; A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, when thoſe years were expired, all the power in the world could not ſtop or hinder their deliverance; Their very enemies procure it for them; Therefore that of the Pſalmiſt is very pertinent, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 102.13. <hi>The time to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour her, yea, the ſet time is come</hi>: Hence you have in the Prophecies of <hi>Daniel</hi> and <hi>Revelation,</hi> the determinate fixed times for the great troubles and great deliverances of the Church, though expreſſed obſcurely; A time and half time, as alſo ſo many daies putting daies for years.</p>
            <p>Let us firſt conſider this as <hi>relating to Chriſt</hi>; and obſerve the ſpeciall times and hours God had appointed concerning him,<note place="margin">I. In relation to Chriſt.</note> and then treat of it more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally.</p>
            <p>And 1. The time of Chriſts coming into the world was wholly determined by Gods wiſedom and his good pleaſure; Why Chriſt did not come ſooner or later, who is able to give any other reaſon but the good pleaſure of God? Hence it's called <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.6. <hi>a due time,</hi> and <hi>Gal.</hi> 4 6. <hi>the fulneſſe of time.</hi> There was no ſuch convenient time as that appointed by God, and it's obſerved as one reaſon, that then Chriſt came rather then at another time, becauſe the devils power was ſo great over men; We never reade in any age of ſo many
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:65216:26"/>
poſſeſſed by devils as was while Chriſt abode upon the earth; If therefore the wiſe man obſerve a time appointed by God for every work and purpoſe under heaven, then muſt this much more be true concerning that great and maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peice of all Gods works: The ſending his Sonne into the world, our Saviour judged it a bleſſed thing to live in thoſe daies, and ſee thoſe times wherein Chriſt lived, doing the work of a Redeemer, <hi>Luk.</hi> 10.23, 24. It was <hi>Auſtins</hi> deſire to have ſeen Chriſt in the Fleſh, but though it was ſo happy a thing to have ſeen theſe things, therefore <hi>Simeon</hi> deſired to depart as having happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe enough when he had ſeen Chriſt the ſalvation of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> yet unleſſe alſo they did behold him with the eye of faith at the ſame time, they are ſo farre from being the more happy, that they were the more miſerable, as appeareth by what is ſaid to <hi>Chorazin</hi> and <hi>Bethſatha.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. To take up what was hinted before, <hi>There was an hour and time for Chriſts diſcharging the work of a Prophet, and doing ſuch Miracles as might confirm him to be a Meſſias,</hi> as you heard, <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.4. and certainly in that Chriſt did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore publiſh himſelf to the world, but ſtaid till Gods call came, till the time appointed by him; This ſhould teach all, eſpecially thoſe that undertake a publike Miniſtery to follow his example in humility and modeſty; Chriſt himſelf though endowed with all wiſedom took not his own time, but Gods time; and <hi>Paul</hi> would not have a novice taken into the Miniſtry, leſt he ſhould be <hi>puft up with pride and fall into condemnation of the devil</hi>; 1 Tim. 3.6. We may juſtly wonder what Chriſt did all that time, as ſome have; What God did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he made the world, and although the Papiſts have feigned many things yet we muſt conclude he lived a private life, following the trade and profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his Father, which made them ſay, <hi>Is not this the Carpenters Sonne?</hi> Mar. 6.5. And it's good to obſerve how diligent our Saviour was, while he had this hour to work, <hi>I muſt work while I have day, the night cometh and none can work,</hi> Joh. 9 4. Thus we ſhould be like Bees gathering honey, while we have the Spring; get Manna in the morning while it falleth.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>The third hour of Chriſt was the time of his ſufferings,</hi> concerning which he often ſaid, <hi>My hour is not yet come,</hi> and when it was come, he moſt readily yeelded himſelf; Now in this hour many things are obſervable, as</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That all the power and policy that his enemies did uſe were not able to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail over him till his hour came</hi>: Though he preached every day, and went up and down doing good, by all which his enemies were the more provoked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, yet they were not able to take an hair from him, and how obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable is that when ſome bid him depart, for <hi>Herod</hi> would kill him, <hi>Go</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and tell that fox, behold I do miracles, to day, and to morrow, and the third day I ſhall be perfected; Nevertheleſſe I muſt work to day and to morrow:</hi> The mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, that maugre all his malice and power<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet he ſhould do his work, and be preſerved till his hour did come, ſo that all endeavours, all counſels are fruſtrated which meet not with Gods appointed time, only Chriſt knew when his hour was, which God keepeth ſometimes ſecret from his people. Again</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Obſerve the wiſedom and prudence of Chriſt when danger was come, becauſe then it was not his hour</hi>; Sometimes he departed ſecretly, and went from place to place to avoid the malice of his enemies, yea, his father and mother fled with him while a childe to eſcape death, This teacheth us, That it is our duty to preſerve our ſelves from ruine, when we have not a call or obligation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; So the Prophets in <hi>Jezabels</hi> time were hid by many in a cave, and thoſe Noble Worthies recorded by the Apoſtle that fled and hid themſelves in caves and mountains, they are ſaid to do it by faith; It was not ſinfull fear but faith, ſo that we are diligently to conſider when it is our call, our duty, when God requireth of us, as the time and hour of our affliction, that we muſt loſe
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:65216:26"/>
all for him, and in this we muſt not conſult with fleſh and bloud; for that ſaith as <hi>Peter</hi> to Chriſt, <hi>Maſter, ſave thy ſelf,</hi> who had that ſevere Rebuke, <hi>Get theee behinde me Satan.</hi> Then on the other ſide, when the time of Chriſts ſufferings did come, every thing brought it about; A <hi>Judas,</hi> a Diſciple of his own he betraieth him, and all his adverſaries do eaſily inſult over him, and then he doth not as before depart out of the way, no, but though be knew he was to ſuffer at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> yet he ſet his face to go thither, and though he could have commanded Legions of Angels to have reſcued him, and we reade that thoſe who come to ſurpriſe him fell down immediatly being ſtricken with his Majeſty, yet he will not deliver himſelf; No, though his enemies did with ſo much ſcorn bid him ſave himſelf, which teacheth us, that when the hour of our afflictions is come, when God manifeſtly diſcovers it muſt be the time of our trouble, that then we do with all patience and chearfulneſſe reſign our ſelves into his hands.</p>
            <p>And thus much as it relates to Chriſt,<note place="margin">II. Gods other diſpenſations.</note> Now let us conſider of it in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, and we ſhall ſee how God hath hours and times either of anger, or mercy in the world.</p>

            </p>

There is his Mediatory glory; That which he hath not as God but as Mediatour; This God beſtowed upon him after he had been in the ſtate of humiliation, for after all that debaſement and miſery he willingly undertook, God did exalt him to glory, and gave him a name above all principalities and powers: yea, giving all power in heaven and earth to him; The government of the whole Church, and a command over all Ordinances and duties there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, to bleſſe and give ſucceſſe to them, of which the Scripture ſpeaketh often.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It hath been greatly diſputed,<note place="margin">Whether Chriſt did me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit glory for himſelf.</note> Whether this glory and exaltation was by Chriſt truly merited at Gods hands, whether from his ſufferings he merited at Gods hand all that glory he ſpeaks of; All confeſſe he did not merit to himſelf the hypoſtatical Union nor his habituall grace, or the happineſſe of his ſoul, becauſe no merit could precede theſe, only this is diſputed, Whether all that honour and glory which accrewed to him after his birth, and before and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his death, he did truly merit at Gods hand by his active and paſſive obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience: Some not only of the Papiſts but of the Orthodox, as <hi>Zanchy,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend he did truly merit this, though here he praieth for it; Others as reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely deny it, becauſe Chriſt had no reſpect to him, but to us only in this work of redemption; Others think it is but raſhneſſe and curioſity to buſie our ſelves in the Point; but I have ſpoken to this more fully in the doctrine of Juſtification, and ſhall ere we come to the end of this Chapter more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly conſider the Socinian errours in this Point. This is plain, the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture affirmeth God hath appointed ſuch an order, that firſt he muſt ſuffer, and then enter into glory, as <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.8. <hi>Luk</hi> 24.26. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.9<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Here is an order, but whether it be of meer antecedency, or cauſality and merit, that is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly ſaid, I ſhall not trouble you in it, it's enough, that we ſee God did an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer this Petition he praieth for, and that in every reſpect to the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, <hi>Father, glorifie thy Sonne.</hi>

               <hi>That it was the holy and wiſe will of God the Father to exalt and glorifie Chriſt.</hi> Gods great purpoſe from all Eternity was to give honour and glory to Chriſt: Indeed Chriſt while he was here on the earth, had ſome beam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of this glory, ſome irradiations now and then, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.28. Therefore the Father told Chriſt <hi>he had both glorified his Name, and would glorifie it</hi>; Gods purpoſe to glorifie Chriſt was above that purpoſe to glorifie men, for they are but members, and he is the head<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yea, ſome ſay, this deſign to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie Chriſt is ſo immutable and abſolutely intended by God, that though man had not fallen, yet they ſay Chriſt would have been incarnated and exalted by the Father: But if we conſult with Scripture we have no other reaſon there aſſigned of Chriſts coming into the fleſh, but of ſaving ſinners: Now leſt it ſhould be thought that while we preach of Chriſts glory,<note place="margin">Chriſts being inveſted with glory redounds to the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of his members.</note> this is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to us, and what comfort or profit is that to us, to hear that Chriſt in his own perſon is inveſted with ſuch glory, you muſt know that this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounds to our profit and advantage much every way; For</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Chriſts glorification is a plain demonſtration of his Conqueſt over all our Enemies</hi>; For had death and the grave, or the Prince of this world been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing over him ſtill, he could not have been glorified,<note place="margin">1. It's a demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of his conqueſt over all our enemies</note> and ſo that would have been true, he did not ſave himſelf, and therefore could not ſave others; Therefore it's a moſt comfortable ſaying, and worthy of all acceptation, to hear that Chriſt is glorified, for this proclaimeth to all, that no enemy could have any power over him, that all our adverſaries are vanquiſht; That our <hi>David</hi> hath killed the <hi>Goliah,</hi> ſo then hear this Truth with comfort, with attention, it concerneth all the godly; It's bleſſed news to hear Chriſt is glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified,

for then thy ſinnes, thy guilt, thy death, and every thing thou feareſt is conquered; If any of theſe do accuſe thee, ſay, if a diſcharge had not been fully made, how could Chriſt be glorified?</p>

               <note place="margin">2. Becauſe of rhat near relation that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us.</note>2.

How ſhall theſe corrupt and weak ſouls ever be made happy and bleſſed? The anſwer is eaſie, What is already done to Chriſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, will in time be fulfilled to us; Death and the grave had no dominion over him, no more ſhall it have over us: Hence it is that the Scripture ſaith, We are <hi>already ſet down with Chriſt in heavenly places,</hi> Eph. 2.6. becauſe he is our head; Fear not then, ſuch a glorified head will not forget his members: He ſaid, <hi>He went to provide a manſion place,</hi> Joh. 14.2. It cannot then be but that Chriſt will ſet you on Thrones of his glory as well as he himſelf is ſet; So that this doctrine is wholly for thy comfort.</p>

            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:65216:29"/>In the next place let us conſider the nature of this glory,<note place="margin">The nature of this glory which Chriſt praied for. There were three degrees to it.</note> which Chriſt prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> And 1. There were three degrees to it.</p>
            <p>The firſt and immediate beginning of this glory, <hi>was upon his Reſurrection</hi>: After the black and diſmall clouds this Sunne had been in, the firſt glory of it began to appear in its Reſurrection from the grave: By this he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror of death and the grave; By this he judged the Prince of the world; Till this was, in all mens thoughts Chriſt ſeemed to be overcome, in all appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance he was now brought under the power and command of death and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan. He was judged weak till this power diſcovered it ſelf, and this reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction being not only by the Fathers power but his own. He being the <hi>Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> that brake the barres and bonds of death, it was thereby made manifeſt to all the world, that he was the Sonne of God; Reſurrection is ſuch an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible thing to humane reaſon, and ſo incredible, that <hi>Paul</hi> was cried down, for a vain babler, <hi>Act.</hi> 17.18. in promulging ſuch doctrine, and only in the Church of God, Was ever ſuch a thing heard of? But this Reſurrection was remarkable in Chriſt who not only raiſed himſelf from the dead, but alſo cauſed many others to riſe with him, here was the firſt degree of his glory.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſecond degree was his aſcenſion into heaven, and this did exceed his Reſurrection, for though he was riſen, yet he converſed with his diſciples, did eat and drink with them occaſionally, ſo that he was to partake of greater and fuller glory, when he aſcended into heaven. This Aſcenſion of his into Heaven was great matter of wonderment and aſtoniſhment to his Diſciples; They all ſtood admiring when he was carried up thither, <hi>Act.</hi> 1.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The laſt and chiefeſt degree of this glory, was ſitting down at the right hand of God; By which expreſſion is meant that great and wonderfull honour which God put upon him, he ſitteth at the right hand, that demonſtrateth a full and compleat victory over all his enemies, and a quiet poſſeſſion of this glory: In theſe three things lieth all the glory Chriſt praieth for, Reſurrection, Aſcenſion, and ſitting down at Gods right hand, all which immediatly followed his paſſions and ſufferings, and God had appointed ſuch an order, that one muſt be before the other, and ſuch a way God alſo doth take with his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: They muſt have a Crown of thorns before they have a Crown of glory.</p>
            <p>In the third place let us conſider ſome of the moſt eminent and chiefeſt particulars, wherein this glory of Chriſt doth manifeſt it ſelf.<note place="margin">Wherein this glory of Chriſt doth conſiſt.</note>
            </p>
            <p>And 1. It <hi>lieth in that ſpirituall command and authority which he hath in his Church</hi>; This is expreſſed when he ſaith, <hi>All power is given to me in heaven and earth, therefore go make diſciples, and baptize.</hi> Here you ſee the Inſtitution of Sacraments is founded upon that power given to Chriſt, and from this it is <hi>Eph.</hi> 4, That upon his Aſcention, <hi>He led captivity captive, and gave gifts to men:</hi> By this power the Church of God is like <hi>Solomons</hi> Queen richly attired in all curious needle-work; It's from this glory of Chriſts that he putteth ſuch glory on the Church, ſo that for all the Ordinances and diſpenſations thereof, for all the ſucceſſe and benefit to be reaped by them, We are to look up to Chriſt, hereupon we ſay, that to bring any other doctrine, any other Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or worſhip then Chriſt hath appointed, is a capitall crime; It's to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade the <hi>Jura regalia,</hi> which Chriſt hath obtained of God, and therefore to deſpiſe the Ordinances, the gifts, the Miniſtery that Chriſt hath appointed in his Church, is to neglect and contemn a great part of that glory God put on Chriſt for this end <hi>Col.</hi> 3. You have the Apoſtle running out into ſuch full and large expreſſions concerning Chriſt, making him the head of the Church, in whom God hath put all fulneſſe, that he is to have the preheminence in all
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:65216:30"/>
things; Let us not then deſpiſe but magnifie all the Ordinances, Offices, and gifts Chriſt hath appointed, for when he aſcended in his triumph to heaven, he ſcattered theſe gifts as great Emperours do uſe to do large bounties to their people, and they are for heavenly and ſpirituall advantages, All power he hath is to bleſſe, to convert. to comfort, to ſanctifie every Ordinance about which we are emploied.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Another particular of his glory, is <hi>to make all things ſubject to him</hi>; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever dignities or principalities there are, that all ſhould acknowledge and bow to him; This is the Sunne to which all the Stars do their obeiſance; This is the name that God gave him above all Names, that every knee, every creature ſhould ſubmit to him, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. By <hi>name</hi> is not meant bowing the knee at the name of it, that was never heard of till many years after Chriſt in the Church, but by name according to Scripture cuſtome is meant Chriſt himſelf; Even as the Name of God is God himſelf, glorious, manifeſted, beleeved on, and every way exalted; Now this ſubjection all give to him as the King of Kings and Lord of Lords, is twofold, in ſome it is <hi>voluntary</hi> and <hi>willing,</hi> Pſa. 110. <hi>Thy people ſhall be willing in the day of thy power,</hi> Chriſt doth by his glorious pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er change and alter their natures, whereby they are full of love and chearfulneſs in taking him to be their Lord and King; They do readily obey his commands, ſo that the glory of Chriſt is magnified by all his Children; But then there is a neceſſitated and forced ſubmiſſion, ſuch whom he is ſaid to rule with a rod of iron, and the devils who are under the earth, they by conſtraint ſubmit unto him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This glory vouchſafed unto Chriſt is, that all things ſhould be done in his Name; All Church-meetings, all Church-cenſures, all Church-duties, ſhould be wholly performed in and by him; Thus for praier, whatſoever ye ſhall ask in my name, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.13. For Church-meetings, when two or three are gathered together in my Name, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.20. For Church-cenſures, When you are met together in Chriſts Name to deliver ſuch an one to Satan, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. Thus the glory of Chriſt is wonderfully magnified in the Aſſembly of the Saints, for every thing that is due is accepted of in Chriſts Name; No praier is received but in Chriſts Name, no performance hath its due effect, but in Chriſts Name; This heavenly and holy Court is kept in Chriſts Name only; We are to preach in his Name, we bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize in his Name, all things have their ſucceſſe and efficacy, as they come out in his Name; Thus (beloved) you ſee that all our thoughts and deſires ſhould be to glorifie Chriſt, If it be the Fathers will to glorifie him, it ſhould be ours much more.</p>
            <p n="4">4. This glory given to Chriſt will be wonderfully expreſſed in the day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for 1. then he ſhall make known his power and majeſty to all the world; what glorious deſcriptions have we in the Scripture of Chriſt coming to judge? with what terrour and trembling to all beholders? what great alterations and changes will be upon the whole world? What a glorious train of Angels ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying him? never was ſuch a ſight ſeen, No words can expreſſe it; Now all this is to be managed by the Sonne. The Fathar hath given all judgement to him, and he hath appointed to judge the world by that man Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>Act.</hi> 17.21. Howſoever then while he was in the fleſh, he was judged by others, he was as a <hi>worm</hi> and <hi>no man,</hi> yet then a great alteration will be made; He that was a Lamb ſhall then be like a roaring Lion; The day of Judgement is the greateſt day that ever was or ſhall be, called therefore the day and that day, and the day of the Lord, and the judgement of all things and perſons in the world is given to Chriſt the Sonne of God, and this tends to his exceeding great glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, for then his friends and loyall Subjects ſhall receive their full and finall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and then his ſtubborn and obſtinate enemies ſhall receive their compleat puniſhments, all the honour <hi>Ahaſhuerus</hi> could put on his favorites was nothing
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:65216:30"/>
to this ſpiritual and heavenly glory, which the Father will put on the Son, for it is a ſpiritual glory, that was a temporall in earthly things only; There are thoſe who would make the kingdom and glory of Chriſt to be in a great manner tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall, and conſiſting in a Monarchy here on earth, but as Chriſts Prieſthood was wholly ſpiritual, ſo alſo is his kingly glory, for as he hath made the godly Kings and Prieſts only in a ſpiritual ſence, thus was he alſo; Here then is work for the eyes of Faith, Come with the Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> to ſee all the glory Chriſt hath, not with a bodily eye, but an eye of faith, and thy admiration will be greater then hers was.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>This glory is eternall,</hi> not like the glory of the world, which the devil ſhewed in a moment, it quickly paſſed away, but this will abide for ever; not but that Chriſt ſhall at laſt give up this Kingdome into his Fathers hands again; He ſhall no more diſcharge the acts of an Advocate or Interceſſor for us in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, only the glory of this ſhall alwaies continue; It ſhall to all Eternity be recorded, that he was the Mediatour; That he is the Saviour who hath brought us to life and immortality; Thus to all eternity the tongue of all the Saints ſhall be employed in celebrating this glory.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> of Inſtruction, Is Chriſt thus glorified by the Father? then take this as a ſure pledge of thy glorification in time; It cannot be that he ſhould have glory alone himſelf; No, in this praier he ſaith, Father, I will, that they be where I am; Oh let this comfort and animate thee, my glorified head is in heaven, and will in time make a glorified member ſutable to him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Is it Gods purpoſe to glorifie the Sonne? then let us alſo glorifie him, our hour is continuall, we have occaſion every day, we glorifie him.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By bleſſing and praiſing God for him, God never did ſo much for us, as when he gave Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We glorifie him when we live to him, when we wholly ſet up Chriſt, give him the glory of all the comfort and grace we doe partake of.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We glorifie him when we can part with and leave all things for his ſake, when we can ſay, All things are but droſſe in compariſon of him.</p>

            <p>THE next thing in order is the laſt Argument or motive Chriſt uſeth in this Praier, for Glory, and that is, the end and motive why he deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth it, which is altogether pure and ſincere: He deſireth it not for himſelf, or in reference meerly to his own advantage, but thereby to glorifie God; O admirable example of modeſty and humility! He that thought it no robbery to be equal with God, yet as Mediatour challengeth nothing for himſelf ultimately: He that in other places is called <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> now denieth that prerogative, and giveth it ſolely to God his Father, ſo truly did he ſay, <hi>Nulla Creatura humilior Deo,</hi> that is, Chriſt, you ſee then this Sun of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe making himſelf like one of the inferiour Starres, borrowing all light, and returning the ſame again to God, and certainly if Chriſt himſelf as Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour will not take to himſelf the glory due to God, then this will highly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn all that arrogance in man, who ſhall deſire any earthly or heavenly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages meerly for his own ſake; That ſhall deſire riches, honours greatneſſe, or heaven it ſelf, for any other end but to glorifie God thereby: It's not the much eating but the good digeſting that gives health, and it's not the poſſeſſing of great abundance but the wiſe improving of all for Gods glory that makes happy, ſo then this example of Chriſt ſhall be conſidered by us as an argument <hi>a majori ad minus</hi>; That if Chriſt praied for all that heavenly and tranſcendant glory principally to glorifie God thereby, and did not chiefly aim at himſelf, then how much more ſhould man deſire either heavenly or earthly glory, not ſo much that it is his own good, as that thereby it will be inſtrumentall to Gods glory? and hence obſerve.</p>

That is the Pirate which doth intercept the golden Fleete of our praiers, that they return not again fraughted with good things for us, yea, that is remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.5. Chriſt is there ſaid not to glorifie himſelf, he did not undertake that office of a ſpirituall Prieſt till he was called by God, he glorified not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; And as for his paſſive obedience, all thoſe ſufferings and ignominious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches which he did undergo, it was only thereby to glorifie the wiſedom and goodneſſe and infinite love of God to man, which made the Apoſtle call Chriſt crucified, <hi>the power and wiſedom of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.24, 25. Joh. 13.31. There we have Chriſts glorifying of God, and Gods glorifying of Chriſt both put together;. When <hi>Judas</hi> was gone out to accompliſh Chriſts death, Now (ſaith he) <hi>the Son of man is glorified and God is in him</hi>: Chriſts ſufferings were his glory, and Gods glory, and then mark the connexion, If God be glorified by him God will glorifie him again, he ſhall be no loſer, and that in himſelf, Oh how admirable and different is that glory which God himſelf giveth from that which either Men or Angels can beſtow! ſo then we ſee all the end of Chriſts humiliation, both in his active and paſſive obedience, was to glorifie God.</p>

If our eyes were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened with the Prophets Servant, we ſhould ſee more were with us then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us; And then all things, the inanimate and animate creatures are under his power; The Diſciples wondred at it, when they ſaid, <hi>What manner of man is this whom the windes and Seas obey?</hi> Mat. 8.27. So that this power of Chriſt is farre more comprehenſive then this Text expreſſeth, for Chriſt only ſpeaks of men, becauſe he inſtanceth in that part of power whereby he giveth eternall life to thoſe that beleeve, and ſuch are only men.</p>

               <hi>yet the adminiſtration and exerciſe of it is by his ſpirit called therefore the Spirit of Chriſt,</hi> by that he convinceth, by that he converteth, by that he comforteth; Inſomuch that Chriſt told his Diſciples, It was expedient he ſhould bodily <hi>depart from them,</hi> but he would <hi>ſend the Comforter to them,</hi> Joh. 15.26. ſo that not the Pope but the Spirit of God is <hi>Vicarius Chriſts,</hi> in Chriſts ſtead; Hence it is that all the ſame glorious and ſpirituall effects in the Scripture, are ſometimes attributed to the Father, ſometimes to Chriſt, and ſometimes to the holy Ghoſt in their peculiar appropriation; Chriſt by his Spirit is to be expected and praied for as the authour of all that grace and comfort we ſtand in need of.</p>

               <hi>yet that which in the Text is conſiderable, is, that it reacheth to the hearts and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of men</hi>; And this is more then any temporall power can do, He bids <hi>Matthew the Publican</hi> Follow him, and he leaveth all to follow him; He caſts an eye upon <hi>Peter,</hi> and he preſently goeth out and weepeth bitterly; It's up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſpirits and conſciences of men this power of Chriſt is moſt converſant; It's by this their mindes are enlightned, their hearts changed, their luſts ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued, and they made new creatures, which made him ſay, he was the <hi>life, the truth,</hi> and <hi>the way,</hi> Joh. 14.6.) he is all things efficiently for our ſalvation, ſo that the great things we are to expect from this power is convictions of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience and converſions of heart; If the blindneſſe of thy minde, if the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of thy heart be too heavy a ſtone for thee to remove, then lift up thy eyes to Chriſt, Say O Lord thou haſt power over all fleſh, Thou canſt ſubdue and conquer every mans heart; No man, no Angel can do this, Therefore take thou the ſole glory in doing of it.</p>

Though Chriſt as God made the world, all things are ſupported and born up by him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. yet theſe things are not ſo conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as what is done to mans ſalvation; Therefore he makes the great end of his coming into the world <hi>to ſave that which is loſt,</hi> he came to diſſolve the works of the devil. His Titles that he hath are in reference to heavenly advantages; He is called <hi>Jeſus</hi> becauſe he ſaveth his people from their ſins, and Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe furniſhed with all fitneſſe and fullneſſe to be a Saviour; The Jews in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed

they looked for a Meſſias that ſhould deliver them out of the captivity and bondage they were in; They hoped for ſuch a power over all fleſh, that ſhould reſtore them to their ancient temporall glory; But this carnal preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice was their undoing.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">V. It is infinite power.</note>Fifthly, <hi>This power muſt needs be infinite,</hi> for although it doth not follow that becauſe he hath power over all fleſh, that therefore he is omnipotent and infinite, yet if you do regard the end why he hath all this power, it muſt neceſſarily be infinite, for it's to gather and ſave a people out of the world, to juſtifie their perſons, to ſanctifie their natures, It's to judge all men at the laſt day; Now how can he be judge of all mens lives, yea, their ſecret and heart ſinnes, if he have not infinite knowledge, and although the humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Chriſt be not capable of infinity and omniſciency, yet the perſon that is the Judge muſt be ſo qualified; This infinite power which Chriſt hath on one ſide proclaimeth unſpeakable terrour to Chriſts enemies, and on the other ſide ineffable joy to his friends.</p>

               <note place="margin">VI.

When Chriſt had acknowled that ſoveraign arbitrary power of God in revealing the Myſteries of ſalvation to babes, and hiding them from the wiſe of the world, he addeth, <hi>All things are delivered me of my Father, No man knoweth the Father but he to whom the Sonne will reveal him</hi>; So then this gracious power of Chriſt is not indifferently exerciſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all; To ſome Chriſt revealeth the will of God effectually, to others not; There were many Publicans beſides <hi>Matthew,</hi> yet to him Chriſt makes known himſelf and not to others.

               <note place="margin">1. In appointing a Miniſtry for the converſion of ſouls.</note>And Firſt, <hi>This is a remarkable Inſtance of his power to appoint a Miniſtery for the converſion and ſaving of peoples ſouls</hi>: Whatſoever thy thoughts may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the nullity or uſeleſneſſe of it, yet this is a clear effect of his power, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. when he ſaid, All power was given him in heaven and earth, then he giveth his Apoſtles Commiſſion to go teach and baptize all Nations; Obſerve the reaſon why Chriſt beginneth with this Preface, All power is given me, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and therefore Go and baptize; Becauſe it's of high concernment to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and imbolden the Miniſters of God to conſider whoſe Servants they are, whoſe work they go about; They come from him who is able to defend them againſt the whole world, how eaſily might the Apoſtles be dejected with the greatneſſe of the work<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and their utter unfitneſſe? What are ſuch poor and deſpicable men as they are to ſet againſt the lives and manners of the whole world? but he that hath all power in heaven and earth bid them Go preach, Go baptize, and thus <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11. The Miniſtry is there made the great and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble work Chriſt did, upon his Aſcenſion to heaven, ſo that to oppoſe Chriſts Miniſtery, to ſet againſt this is to ſet againſt Chriſt himſelf; It's not their power but Chriſts power thou wouldeſt deſtroy.</p>

In giving ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe to the means of grace</note>Secondly, This power goeth further then to appoint a meer Miniſtery, <hi>he bleſſeth it,</hi> he giveth ſucceſſe, he makes it to bring forth much fruit. This makes the Apoſtle in his firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> ſo much exalt Chriſt and advance him, While one cried up this Teacher, another that, he bid them remember that all the <hi>Pauls</hi> and <hi>Apolloes</hi> in the Word though never ſo emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, were but Miniſters by whom they did beleeve, yea <hi>Col.</hi> 3.19. thoſe that did ſo much admire and ſet up Angels, who eaſily may be thought to do more

then the beſt Miniſters, yet <hi>Paul</hi> throweth all ſuch doctrine down to the ground, and bids them hold the head Chriſt, from whence all parts of the body receive their nouriſhment; Oh this cannot be preſſed enough on you, Many are not ſo prophane to deſpiſe the Miniſtery, to cry down Ordinances (though there be ſuch in the world) but then they are without Chriſt in the Miniſtery, without Chriſt in the Ordinances: As the Apoſtle ſpake of ſome <hi>without God in the world,</hi> So theſe are without Chriſt in the Church: It's not the Miniſtery or Ordinances but Chriſt in them and by them which commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicateth vertue and efficacy.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Chriſts power is ſeen in convincing and enlightning mens underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings ſo farre as to ſee their ſinful and damnable eſtate,</hi>

               <hi>as alſo the abſolute neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a remedy through Chriſt.</hi> Thus Chriſt doth exceed the Sunne, for though the Sunne give light to the world, yet it doth not give eyes or ability to ſee, but Chriſt doth not only make the bodily blinde to ſee, and deaf to hear, but thoſe that are ſpiritually darkened in their underſtandings, he makes them to know Chriſt he doth ſo teach, that the ſoul cannot but learn, it cannot refuſe or gainſay, O Lord, I feel ſuch light in my heart, ſuch evidence upon my conſcience, that I cannot hide this light any way; But as thoſe glorious apparitious of light which <hi>Paul</hi> had and others, came with great amazement, filled them with trembling and aſtoniſhment, ſo doth Chriſts power upon the hearts of Beleevers; Oh then enquire who are they, where are they that have found Chriſts power thus upon their mindes and conſciences?

And it was wonderfull in the beginning of the Goſpel yea, in the firſt beginnings of Reformation out of Popery, the glorious workings of Chriſt were admirable to this purpoſe; Then Chriſt and the Miniſtry went along to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; No ſooner did the Trumpet blow, but <hi>the wals of Jericho fell down</hi>; When Chriſt thus powerfully taught them, they were quickly perſwaded to leave their Idols and their luſts to follow him: The firſt Reformers were ſo many divine <hi>Orpheus</hi>'s that made the very beaſts and trees to move, the illiterate and ſtupid people to ſeek out for wiſedom and heavenly underſtanding, You may ſay then, Why doth not Chriſt ſtill come with the ſame power? Why are not our Churches Chriſts Schools, wherein every day he teacheth ſome or other, many learn by the Miniſter, but few are taught by Chriſt? They do not know the truths as they are in Jeſus; There are many go to falſe cauſes; But thoſe impediments which indeed reſiſt this Point are</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The atheiſm and unbelief reigning every where,</hi> ſo that we may take up that old complaint, <hi>Lord, Who will beleeue our report?</hi> It's ſaid of ſome, Chriſt could do no miracles there, becauſe <hi>of their unbelief,</hi> Mar. 6.5, 6. Not but that he had power, but to ſhew what an obſtacle unbelief was; When they inſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over Chriſt at the Croſſe, <hi>Let him come down and ſave himſelf, if he be the Sonne of God let him deliver him,</hi> Heb. 4.2. Chriſt did not theſe things not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he wanted power but they were wicked; ſo Chriſts power is not ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; It's not becauſe there is no Miniſtry, but becauſe the unbelief of man is great.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Chriſt demonſtrates not his power it may be becauſe <hi>Cuſtomarineſſe under the Word breeds contempt and negligence</hi>: At the firſt mens affections are quick, but when accuſtomed to the world all the excellency and livelineſſe of it is taken away. A blinde man upon the firſt recovery of ſight would admire the Sunne, but thoſe that are uſed to it regard it not, though ſo glorious a creature.</p>

Though there are not ſo many yet there are ſome few in moſt places that have found this mighty power of Chriſt on their ſouls; Though there were not many raiſed out of the grave by Chriſt, yet one <hi>Lazarus</hi> is enough to demonſtrate the glorious power of Chriſt; One in a Family, one in a Town, yea, one in a whole Nation, is enough to prove that Chriſt though now in heaven hath this power over men in the earth; Let ſuch then who have been thus taught, ſo as no man, no book could teach them, give glory to Chriſt, bleſſe Chriſt for good Sermons, good Books, eſpecially the Word of God, but above all that vertue cometh from Chriſt by theſe to heal thee; Though the woman had touched the hem of Chriſts garments a thouſand times, yet if Chriſt had not cauſed vertue to come out of him, ſhe had not been cured, ſo it is here.</p>

But this Chriſt worketh; Alas the heart troubled for ſinne, rageth and is like an hell, till Chriſt bids it be quiet and ſtill: Hence he promiſeth to ſend the Comforter, and it's his Spirit which is ſent into our hearts, making us to cry <hi>Abba Father,</hi> Gal. 4.6. Oh then let the grieved and perplexed ſoul through the guilt of ſin, that can finde no reſt, no eaſe, go to him that hath power indeed to command theſe waves to be ſtill, See with what love and power <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.28. this is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, <hi>Come to me ye that are heavy laden, and I will eaſe you</hi>: Chriſt will give eaſe; See how imperiouſly he ſpeaks, Let your ſinne be never ſo terrifying, your conſcience never ſo diſquieted, The devils never ſo much troubling and tempting of you, yet I will give you eaſe; <hi>You ſhall finde reſt for your ſouls</hi>: No earthly power in the world can ſay thus truly; Therefore this is to direct the godly in their black temptations; They cry out, It cannot be I ſhould have peace, I ſhould have joy; There may as ſoon come fire out of water as peace and quietneſſe out of my heart; Oh remember this Text, <hi>The power Chriſt hath over all fleſh,</hi> Is thine excepted? Chriſt can eaſe and quiet every mans heart but thine; Be aſhamed to think thy weakneſſe more then Chriſts power; Thy guilt more then his conſolations. The other fruit of a godly life is <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal happineſſe</hi>; and this Chriſt doth alſo beſtow upon thoſe that are his; At the day of judgement we reade of him putting them into poſſeſſion, <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Father inherite the Kingdom prepared for you,</hi> Mat. 25. Heb. 5.9. he is called <hi>The authour of eternal ſalvation,</hi> he cals himſelf the <hi>bread of life,</hi> he that eateth on him ſhall never die more, ſo that all that happineſſe and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſſe which is in the life to come is attributed unto Chriſt, both the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe and authour of it: It's he that will ſay, <hi>Well done, good and faithfull Servant, enter thou into thy Maſters joy</hi>: For thoſe Parables that ſpeak of a great King employing his Servants in ſuch work, and then ſo abundantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warding of them, is Chriſt. This ſhould be a great encouragement in Chriſts ſervice; What a glorious and powerful Maſter do ye ſerve? one who is able to requite thee with eternal glory and everlaſting happineſſe, <hi>If we ſuffer with him we ſhall reign with him,</hi> Rom. 8.17. The greatneſſe and bounty of the Maſter doth quicken the Servant; <hi>Haman</hi> was glad of <hi>Ahaſhuerus</hi> his emploi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, becauſe he could put ſuch honour upon him; But oh how ſhould our hearts be enflamed to work for Chriſt, what cannot ſuch a Maſter do for us? Ask any thing in earth or heaven he can beſtow it on thee: How unworthy is it when we grudge at the work Chriſt requireth, when we repine at the Croſſe he would have us take up, This is not to attend whom we ſerve; how great our Maſter is, what Treaſuries he hath out of which he can bountifully reward us.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">VII. Forgive and pardon ſin.</note>Thirdly, <hi>Chriſts power is ſeen in that he can forgive and pardon ſinne,</hi> Which is acknowledged by all, that God only can do it, <hi>Mar.</hi> 2.7. You have this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Chriſt particularly oppoſed by his enemies, but vindicated by him, and that he hath power to forgive ſinnes, he proveth by his power to <hi>work Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi>: Not that to bid a lame man riſe, and take up his bed and walk, is a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er thing then to forgive him, but to their ſence and in outward appearance it was ſo; yea, he doth not only remit ſinne, but he appointeth the Miniſters of the Goſpel to remit and forgive ſins, <hi>viz.</hi> by declaration and application of the Promiſes, and this he ſaith ſhall be confirmed in heaven; Certainly no power can be denied him who can authoritatively and of himſelf pardon ſinne, ſinne being an infinite injury and diſhonour to God, he muſt be equall with God that can remit this, for it's a ſure Rule, <hi>Nemo poteſt remittere de jure
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:65216:37"/>
alieno.</hi> Oh how comfortable is this to meditate on by faith, he hath power to forgive ſinne, who died for thy ſinne, who was crucified that it might be done away: If then thy ſinnes are a burthen to thee, if thou doſt leave and forſake them, doubt not of thy pardon; Oh do not ſay, whether will Chriſt pardon or no, for ſeeing he hath power, his will was abundantly manifeſted in the ſacrificing of himſelf on the Croſſe: Now ſinne is the ſting in every thing, remove ſinne and death is no death, hell is no hell, if Chriſts power takes this away, it takes all away.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>Christs Power is ſeen in giving Laws,</hi>
               <note place="margin">VII. The great Law-giver.</note> 
               <hi>and preſcribing duties to all according to which they ſhould live</hi>: Therefore he cals them his Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the Apoſtle urgeth, <hi>If they died without mercy that refuſed</hi> Moſes <hi>ſpeaking, of how much ſorer puniſhment ſhall they be thought worthy who refuſe him ſpeaking from heaven?</hi> In this reſpect it is that he is ſo often called a <hi>King,</hi> and a Kingdom is attributed to him, becauſe he maketh Laws, and enjoyneth the obſervation of them under higher penalties then any earthly power can do, and that is eternall damnation, and this conſideration is a two edged Sword to many hypocrites; They love Chriſt they ſay, they truſt in him their Redeemer, but they do not obey him as a King; This is a Law-giver who hath power to damn and to ſave; Oh that the prophane and ungodly wretch, who yet hopes for mercy by Chriſt, would lay this to heart more: Art thou obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to him as Lord and King? He ſaith, <hi>Swear not at all,</hi> Doſt thou give obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience? give over thy curſing and ſwearing: He ſaith, <hi>Let not your hearts be overcharged with ſurfeting and drunkenneſſe,</hi> Do you obey this Law? and ſo of <hi>adultery and uncleanneſſe, He that doth but luſt after a woman is guilty of eternal death</hi>; What think you of theſe Laws? Are not theſe holy and juſt? Do you think Chriſt hath not power to be avenged on you? Oh take heed of making this power againſt thee; It's able to undoe thee without hope.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, <hi>Chriſts power is remarkably ſeen, in enabling and ſtrengthening his Children in all their afflictions, ſo that they doe not only bear them,</hi>
               <note place="margin">IX. And ſupporter and comforter of his people.</note> 
               <hi>but triumph therein with joy unſpeakable and full of glory.</hi> This hath magnified the power of Chriſt in heaven more then any thing elſe; Men have wondred and been amazed at the patience of the Saints, and the joy of the Martyrs: But whence came they to be thus endowed with power? Had not they fleſh and bloud as well as others? Was not death with the exquiſite torments of it in it ſelf dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to them as well as others? yea, certainly but Chriſts power in them made them above themſelves: <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking of this wonderfull diſpoſition, to know how to abound and how to want, addeth, <hi>He can do all things through Chriſt that ſtrengthneth him,</hi> Phil. 4.13. So that hereby he will rejoyce in his infirmities, becauſe Chriſts power is thereby more manifeſted, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.5. Oh then here is a good ſubject for the Children of God to dwell on, God doth not call them ſometimes to lay down their lives to a bloudy agony, he doth but exerciſe them with ordinary calamities, ſuch as are common to man, Every carnal natural man hath the like, and their natural ſtrength bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them up in it, yet thou though promiſed the ſtrength of Chriſt crieſt out, Thou ſhalt be overcome, Why art thou ſo weak and full of unbelief? Is not Chriſts power for thy good? Hath he not all this power in heaven and earth for the good of his Children? Doth not thy diffidence make thee doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chriſt be able, whether he can ſupport thee or no? Alas, if theſe leſſe troubles be ſo irkſome, what wouldſt thou do if thou wert called to more fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery trouble? If thou canſt not bear rods, how wilt thou Scorpions? Be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, yea, and afraid of this unbelief, for Chriſt giveth his power only to thoſe that truſt and hope in him; Beleeve and all things will be poſſible to thee.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:65216:38"/>
               <note place="margin">X. The Judge of the world.</note>Sixthly, <hi>If all Inſtances were ſo ſignally demonſtrating the power Chriſt hath over all fleſh as this, that he is appointed to judge the whole world,</hi> both quick and dead are to ſtand at his Tribunal; Two things in this do manifeſt his exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great power, 1. The immediate preparation to it. 2. The Act of judging the preparation to it, for Chriſt by his power ſhall raiſe up all out of their graves, thoſe that for many years have been conſuming into duſt, ſhall then by his power come out of their graves, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.22. <hi>As in</hi> Adam <hi>all died, ſo by Chriſt ſhall all be made alive</hi>; The godly they ſhall riſe becauſe they are mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers to him the head; Hence the Apoſtle argueth the Reſurrection of the one from the other; And the ungodly they ſhall be raiſed by him as a Judge, What temporall power can be imagined like this? and then his ſolemn coming to judgement, in what power Majeſty and trembling will it be, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.7, 8, <hi>Christ ſhall come with his mighty Angels in flaming fire of vengeance</hi>; So then it cannot enter into the heart of man to conceive, how glorious and yet how dreadfull this manifeſtation of Chriſts power will be: And as for the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it ſelf, Chriſt is the Judge, and therefore it's called <hi>the judgement ſeat of Chriſt,</hi> and the day of Chriſts coming; Then ſhall the ſins of all men, yea, the ſecret counſels and purpoſes of heart be manifeſted, Oh what a day will this be; Though Chriſt in the fleſh was contemned, vilified and reproached, yet then he ſhall come in power; At that time he ſhall give finall ſentence concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the ſalvation and damnation of men; This is the great inſtance of his power, Though now we beleeve it only and not ſee it, yet then we ſhall ſee and behold it with our bodily eyes; Oh tremble at this you who will not now in obedience and humility ſubmit your ſelves to him, then look for Chriſt to be a Judge; You look for him only as a Saviour, you think he came only to forgive; No, he cometh as well to deſtroy, He will judge righteous judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; They in the <hi>Revelation</hi> cried to the Mountains to cover them from the wrath of the Lamb.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">XI. And the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duer of his and his Churches enemies.</note>Laſtly, <hi>Chriſts power over all fleſh is ſeen even in this life, by overruling, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering, and ſubduing his enemies</hi>; Chriſt though in heaven hath his enemies, all thoſe that are enemins to the Church, to his Children, they are enemies to Chriſt; <hi>Saul, Saul, why perſecuteſt thou me?</hi> Act. 9.4. We oppoſe Chriſt while we oppoſe his members; Do but hurt the feet, and the head in heaven pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently feels it; But mark what is added, <hi>It's hard for thee to kick againſt the pricks</hi>; Chriſt will reign, his power will be exalted, maugre all the malice in the world, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 2.2. The rage of the Heathens and all their Imaginations were but a vain thing, <hi>God will ſet his Sonne upon the holy hill of Sion,</hi> therefore the Judges of the world are exhorted to <hi>kiſſe the Sonne,</hi> to give him hearty and humble obedience, for they are not able to bear, though but a little of his anger; Hence <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.27. Chriſt is ſaid <hi>to rule the Nations with a rod of Iron, and he will break them in pieces like a Potters veſſell</hi>: Chriſt can as eaſily break all the power and greatneſſe that is lifted up againſt him, as we can break an earthen pot with an Iron rod; And if you ſay, Why then is the power of Turk and Pope ſtill lifted up againſt him? The Apoſtle tels us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.

            <p>THE ſeveral Inſtances or Acts of Chriſts power have been diſpatched, I ſhall only name one Title uſually given him, which will ſerve great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to illuſtrate this power; For although he be compared to many things that denote him the root of all our grace, <hi>To the bread of life,</hi> Joh. 6.35. To <hi>Manna,</hi> To <hi>the Vine,</hi> Joh. 15. To the <hi>Olive tree,</hi> Rom. 11. In na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural things, ſo alſo things of power and love in civill things; To <hi>an husband,</hi> 2 Cor. 11.2. to a <hi>King,</hi> to a <hi>Lord,</hi> yea, <hi>a King of Kings, and Lord of Lords,</hi> yet that which I ſhall pitch on as being moſt comprehenſive, and the Scripture moſt delighting in, is, <hi>That he is an Head to his Church</hi>; The Apoſtle doth fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently uſe this property, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.3. <hi>The head of every man is Chriſt.</hi> Eph. 1.22. He is there <hi>ſet to be Head over all things.</hi> Col. 2.20. <hi>The head of all Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pality.</hi> He is there made head of the Angels, not properly, for Angels cannot be called members of his body, but improperly, as head is uſed for the chief Governour: Seeing then many places to expreſſe this tranſcendent power of Chriſt over all fleſh, uſe this word <hi>Head</hi>: Let us conſider what that implieth, and the reſt ſhall be ſpent in practicall improvement of this Point, Chriſt then is appointed an head, and ſo hath power over all things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>In regard of his eminency and dignity,</hi> for he is exalted above every name, any thing that hath the greateſt fame and glory either in this world or that to come, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.18. <hi>That he might have the preheminence in all things.</hi> So that we ſhould account nothing great in compariſon of Chriſt: All the great men with their great power that in their generations have made ſuch wonderfull changes in the world, in reſpect of Chriſt, ſhould be but as a Mole-hill to the vaſt Heavens: As God hath ſet him above every Name, ſo ſhould we: We reade of ſome Chriſtian Emperors and great Lords that they would not be called <hi>Domini</hi> Lords, as being too great a Title, only <hi>Domni,</hi> by diminution, yea, it's ſaid of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> in whoſe Reign Chriſt was born, that he prohibited himſelf to be called <hi>Dominus.</hi> Some make a peculiar Providence of God in this, becauſe then Chriſt came into the world, who was the Lord of the world, <hi>The world was made by him,</hi> and in this particular there is a great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between a naturall head, and this myſtical, for a natural head doth not make the other parts of the body, but is made proportianably with them, only this myſtical head makes all his members, he doth not only give nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment but create their very being: It's true, Chriſt in the ſtate of his humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was a little lower, or as the word is to be interpreted <hi>for a little while
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:65216:39"/>
lower then the Angels,</hi> Heb. 2. But after this he was <hi>lifted up above all principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and power,</hi> and certainly this is a wonderfull thing, that ſo great part of the world ſhould ſet up that Chriſt as their God in whom they beleeve, that was crucified, dead, and buried, and though now aſcended into heaven, yet we ſee him not with bodily eyes, neither is his Kingdom and power after an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and pompous adminiſtration, yet for what a long ſeaſon, with ſo many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands and millions of men, rich men, great men, Learned men, Kings and Emperours of the world, hath he been worſhiped, This ſheweth the Name God hath given him: Only the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. tels us of many that blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme this Name of our God, by reaſon of the wickedneſſe of Chriſtians; You who profeſſe your ſelves Chriſtians, and yet live in beaſtly and bruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh luſts, you keep off Heathens and Pagans from coming in to owne Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Chriſt is an head in respect of his ſpirituall influence and powerfull commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of his grace and strength to thoſe that are his members,</hi> Col. 2.19. The Apoſtle there and in other places doth much dwell on this; That as the head is the Fountain of all life and motion (for the Scripture ſeemeth to go with them that make the head, not the heart, the Fountain of all life and motion,) From that every part hath its proper nouriſhment, ſo it is with the Church of God, ſo that this ſimilitude affordeth many precious Meditations: for is the godly man fearfull his ſins will overcome, this luſt or that luſt will be too ſtrong for him, he ſhall not have grace enough to conquer it? Let him conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Fulneſſe of his head; is there ſuch a ſinne that Chriſt himſelf is not able to ſubdue? Again, do the godly complain they cannot grow, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue dwarfs, They do not finde any progreſſe, Oh let them conſider, that Chriſt is the head, and he will have his members grow up to their due pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion. Further, Is there any one ſinne, any paſſion, or luſt that is apt to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail over them, to captivate them? here alſo they may have ſtrong confidence in praier, ſaying, O Lord, how unſeemly is ſuch a member to ſo glorious a head, ſuch an ulcerous noiſome part to ſuch an eminent head, if not out of love to me, yet for thy own honour cure me; What head is there that would ſuffer a leprous, noiſome part in the body, if it could help it? Again, Do the godly ſay, they cannot perform their relative graces, their general calling they are able to diſcharge comfortably, but as a Miniſter, as a Husband, as a Wife, herein they fail; O the weakneſſe and imperfections there, Conſider this <hi>head</hi> gives nouriſhment to every part ſutably; The hand hath a nouriſhment of the hand, the eye of the eye, and thus there is in Chriſt a particular ſutable ability for thy proper wants; And if you are not enabled in theſe things, it's not becauſe there is not fulneſſe enough in Chriſt, but thy faith is weak; There is Oil enough but thou haſt no cruſe.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, If the meanneſſe and lowneſſe of thy condition trouble thee, ſaying, though Chriſt the head may communicate to ſuch worthy and eminent Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, they are enabled to doe him great ſervice, yet will he look on ſuch a dead dog as I am? If thou art but the foot, the loweſt part in the body, yet the head mindes that, and procureth its welfare as well as other parts, ſo that this very conſideration is a <hi>Catholicon,</hi> It's a Remedy againſt every Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>This relation of a Head implieth a near <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion and Conjunction</hi>; What can be nearer then the head and the body? yet ſuch a communion and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction there is between Chriſt and the godly, and this very conſideration proveth the perſeverance of the godly; Shall Chriſt loſe one member of his body totally, and ſuffer it to be damned in hell? Oh the comfortable and hopeful thoughts the children of God ſhould have from this relation, from Wife, from Husband, though they be bone of thy bone, and fleſh of thy
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:65216:39"/>
fleſh, thou muſt part, but not from Chriſt; This Union with Chriſt is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of all our comfort and hope againſt Apoſtacy; Again, becauſe of this conjunction we may expect protection and proviſion even in outward things: Doth not the Apoſtle ſay, <hi>No man yet ever hated his own fleſh, but cheriſhed it,</hi> Eph. 5.29. Shall Chriſt then the head forget thee? Shall he withhold his e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e from his own fleſh? Will the head ſuffer the foot to ſtarve? Certainly this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration ſhould wonderfully ſupport againſt all diſcouragements and neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties whatſoever.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Becauſe of this conjunction Chriſt hath a ſympathy and f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

               </gap>l<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with us; What is done againſt the Saints on earth is alſo againſt Chriſt; If one part ſuffers the head condoleth with it, and for this end Chriſt endured thoſe many temptations, that he might know how to pity thoſe that were in the ſame condition, <hi>Heb</hi> 4.15.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Chriſt is the head in respect of government and direction, he is the King of Saints, and the King of Nations:</hi> You reade he had a Rod of Iron to bruiſe his enemies, only this government though it be in the world, yet it is not in a worldly man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; The b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſt and choiceſt part of it is in preparing and fitting thoſe whom the Father hath given him to eternall life, and to theſe his ſpiritual government is full of ſweetneſs and full of power admirable in poſitive and preventing mercies; It's from this gracious government that nothing ſhall fall out either through the malice or policy of hell, that ſhall be able to hinder them from their crown; He is the ſtrong one that hath conquered all the enmity againſt his people; Oh what treaſures of comfort are in this; Thou art under Chriſts ſpiritual govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſo all conditions, all neceſſities, all occurrences in the world they fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thy ſpiritual good; There is nothing can befall thee againſt his will; Thus you ſee all his power ſummed up in this, that he is the head.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now ſpend the other part in practical Inferences, for it's a womb big with many ſuch Concluſions.</p>
            <p>As in the firſt place, Hath Chriſt this power over all? <hi>then let us take heed how we refuſe him ſpeaking or commanding</hi>; If his goodneſſe and mercy will not win you, he hath power enough to awe you: If not love, let fear bring you in, and that quickly, leſt it be too late; The Apoſtle <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.17. aggravateth this, <hi>that if they that deſpiſed</hi> Moſes <hi>died without mercy, of how much ſorer judgement ſhall they be thought worthy who refuſe Chriſt speaking.</hi> Think ye (ſaith the Apoſtle) any one that hath reaſon may gather this, that he ſhall die and be damned with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mercy: But where is Chriſt? You will ſay, how can we refuſe him ſpeaking? The Apoſtle tels you, Thoſe that hear not his Miniſters declaring his will, they do not hear him; Ye that live againſt the Scripture, you whoſe lives are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Word, you are enemies to Chriſt; It's not we that are refuſed, but Chriſt by us; As if an Embaſſadour be contemned, it's not he but the great Perſon that ſends him, whoſe Embaſſadour he is; Well then, we muſt lay this down for an undoubted Axiome, Every man that liveth in the conſtant practiſe of his wickedneſſe, he refuſeth Chriſt who hath all this power; Now let theſe Motives from his power terrifie thee: 1. If it were but an earthly worldly power, what fear, what ſubjection will that put thee in, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. <hi>If thou do evil, be afraid, for he beareth not the ſword in vain</hi>; Oh then know much rather, if thou do evil, be afraid, for Chriſt hath not this power in vain; Doſt thou fear a Priſon and not hell? Art thou afraid of loſing thy outward eſtate, and not thy ſoul, and all happineſſe? Thou feareſt earthly power, but can that damn thee, Can that throw body and ſoul into hell? <hi>Ignoſce O Imperator,</hi> ſaid one, <hi>tu car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerem Deus gehennam minatur</hi>; Well then for every prophane act of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, for drunkenneſſe, uncleanneſſe, unjuſt dealing, there is worſe then any Legall fine or mulct. Chriſt hath appointed everlaſting torments for thoſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of pleaſures; Be not then ſo bruitiſh and athieſticall as to think nothing
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:65216:40"/>

Why doſt thou ſtop thy ear? Why doſt thou ſtifle thy Conſcience? Why doſt thou labour to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe theſe thoughts within?

That there are but ſome that the Father hath given Chriſt. 2. All thoſe that are given they are ſure to have eternal life, becauſe none is greater then the Father, So that thoſe two dangerous doctrines, Univerſal Redemption, and the total and final apoſtacy of the true Saints are evidently confuted by that place. This is ſo clear that we need not matter their many diſtinctions to obſcure the truth. That there are ſome whom the Father hath thus committed to Chriſt to be their Mediatour, appeareth by this expreſſion, <hi>us'd at other times</hi>; The foremention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed place, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.37, 39. is conſiderable; The occaſion of that expreſſion was from the unbelief of the <hi>Capernaits,</hi> who though they had ſeen Chriſts won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders yet beleeved not, but it was no wonder, for ſaith he, <hi>All that is given me of my Father ſhall come unto me</hi>; If you had been thus given to me you would beleeve; Now becauſe it's inviſible and altogether a ſecret, known only to God, who they are that are given to Chriſt, he ſheweth a ſure and certain fruit of this, <hi>They will in time come to him,</hi> i. e. beleeve in him and receive him, ſo that we may invert the Saying, all that do truly beleeve in Chriſt they are given unto him of the Father, and for their encouragement he ſaith, <hi>He will in no wiſe caſt them out,</hi> a Metaphor from the Maſter that takes a Scholar though dull and weak, yet he will forbear and not caſt him out, and leſt it ſhould be thought that though it be well with them, thus for the preſent, yet for the future they may be undone, he addeth <hi>v.</hi> 39. <hi>It's the Fathers will, of all which he hath given me, I ſhould loſe nothing, but raiſe it up again at the laſt day</hi>; Oh the divine and unſpeakable conſolations that are here treaſured up for the godly, So <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.29. which you heard before; One place there is that may be a ſtumbling-block, and ſeem to weaken all, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.12. <hi>Thoſe that thou gaveſt me I have kept, and there is none lost but the Sonne of Perdition</hi>: But the anſwer is, The Apoſtles are ſaid to be given to Chriſt in a twofold reſpect, 1. Of ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification and glorification, and thus <hi>Judas</hi> was not. 2. In reſpect of their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and calling, as when he ſaid, <hi>Have not I choſen twelve, and one of you is a devil?</hi> Joh, 6.10. So that there was a twofold giving of ſome to Chriſt. The one of Juſtification to eternal life, the other of office and ſervice, and that this is meant here is plain, becauſe he is called <hi>the Sonne of perdition,</hi> implying the reaſon why though he was given to him, yet he was not ſaved becauſe he was never ſo given, but he remained a Son of perdition ſtill: Thus it is anſwered by ſome, but the full diſcuſſion of it will be when we come to that verſe. Let us explain the doctrine.</p>
            <p>And firſt we ſee here, that <hi>God the Father hath power to appoint and determine concerning the everlaſting ſalvation and damnation of men</hi>: It's plain, for you ſee it is as the Father wils, whom he chooſeth he giveth to Chriſt, and others they are left by him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8, 19, 20, You ſee there the Apoſtle purpoſely pleading
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:65216:42"/>
this Soveraign power of God, and withall checking theſe bold and curious ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, that men may make againſt it; Hence <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. and in other places, <hi>Election</hi> of ſome to Eternal life is attributed unto him, before the foundation of the world, and this was not for any good thing foreſeen in us, but according to the counſell of his good will, which expreſſion is often uſed otherwiſe, as <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi> obſerved, a notable Patron of the Truth againſt Pelagians, as the Apoſtle ſaid, <hi>It is not of him that willeth or runneth, but of him that ſheweth mercy,</hi> Rom. 9.16. He might have ſaid the contrary, It's not of him that ſheweth mercy but of him that willeth and runneth. This diſparity of Gods grace chooſing ſome and leaving others, is plainly aſſerted by Scripture, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. where Chriſt maketh a ſolemn acknowledging of it: Yea, we ſee the means of grace denied to thoſe of <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon,</hi> who would have repented in ſackcloth and aſhes, yet vouchſafed to thoſe of <hi>Chorazin,</hi> who abuſed and contemned this; This is dreadful to conſider of, But <hi>Austin,</hi> and after him others do excellently curb this bold Interrogation, Why God the Father draweth this man and not the other, do not (ſay they) ſearch curiouſly if thou wilt climbe higher, <hi>caveat precipitium</hi>; And again, if this Anſwer of the Apoſtle, <hi>Who art thou O man, that replieſt againſt God?</hi> will not ſatisfie, <hi>Quaerat doctiorem, ſed caveat, ne inveniat preſumptiorem.</hi> Take we then this Truth for a foundation, it is in the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign power of God to chooſe whom he pleaſeth to Salvation, and to leave the reſt in their damnable eſtate: <hi>Neither is this any cruelty or injuſtice in God,</hi> for he might have forſaken all mankinde, and not recovered one of them, why then ſhould we ſo wickedly murmure at Gods ſecret but righteous diſpenſation of theſe things, and not rather admire the grace of God that any are ſaved?</p>
            <p n="2">
               <note place="margin">How warily the doctrine of predeſtination ſhould be preached.</note>2. <hi>This Truth although it be not wholly to be buried, yet it ought to be preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with much ſobriety and circumſpection, that ſo no juſt offence be given</hi>; It ought to be preached though there are thoſe that would have this light under the buſhell, For we ſee the Apoſtle <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. and in many other places doth greatly encourage and comfort the godly with that mercy of God in chooſing of them before the Foundation of the world, Certainly if this be not known, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſet forth the riches of his glory and grace, as the Apoſtle implieth. The godly are hindred from much of their duty and much of their comfort, while they do not attend to this, yet becauſe this is not milk but ſtrong meat, we muſt regard the auditory and ſubject to whom it is preached; It's <hi>Nazian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens</hi> excellent Rule, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, two or three qualifications as ſo many battlements he muſt build to this roof, leſt men fall down, as 1. <hi>That notwithſtanding this predeſtination, the Fathers giving of ſome to Chriſt, yet as eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man is ſaved by the grace of God, ſo every man is damned from his own proper fault and demerit</hi>; So that we ſee the Scripture is clear in theſe three things, that God from all Eternity did chooſe ſome to eternal ſalvation, which cannot be fruſtrated, and that theſe he will in time effectually call, and change their hearts, nothing ſhall prohibit or hinder their converſion; and 3. Thoſe who die and are damned, have cauſe to blame none but themſelves, <hi>Thy deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is of thy ſelf,</hi> Death and hell is alwaies made the <hi>Wages of ſinne</hi>: Now if you ſay, how can Gods Election and converting grace in time be reconciled with the uſe of means, this is clear, the Scripture aſſerts one and commands the other, and if we could not untie this knot, it were our weakneſſe, not any diſparagement to the Truth.</p>
            <p>Therefore 2. <hi>This is ſo to be preached as that all diligence and care is to be uſed in the means</hi>; For we cannot think that the Scripture ſpeaks contradiction ſo notoriouſly; For in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> the beginning of the firſt Chapter is to deſcribe this great work of God from all Eternity, yet in the latter part he exhorts them to put off all ſinne, and to be diligent in all their
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:65216:42"/>
relation graces, and at another time <hi>Work out your ſalvation with fear and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, for it's God that worketh in you</hi>; Yea, <hi>Paul</hi> who was ſo aſhamed of his Election, and that the Arminians grant he had an abſolute Election, yet he kept down his body that he might not be a Reprobate, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.27. This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is the difficulty how to reconcile theſe, that abſolute Election is not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the means, nor the uſe of means contradict an abſolute Election is affirmed by the Orthodox, ſeveral waies have been attempted by the Learned for the concord of them, but ſuppoſe we could not be ſo comprehenſive, as <hi>Cajetan,</hi> and ſome of the Schoolmen confeſſe it an unſearchable Myſtery, and therefore adviſeth Preachers to teach their people to ſubmit to it, as to the Myſtery of the Trinity, yet ſeeing the Scripture affirmeth one and commands the other, it's plain they are conſiſtent and compoſſible one with another, though we could not finde out the manner how.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Nor to dwell at this time long on this Subject which is but obliquely touched on, <hi>Gods giving of ſome only to Chriſt, is ſo to be preached, that it doth not diſcourage any humble Penitent, or troubled man for ſinne, that ſeeks and thirſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth after the grace of God</hi>; The weakneſſe of this Doctrine lieth here as it is thought; Therefore the adverſaries thereof do continually batter at this place; As if like <hi>Pharaoh</hi> we demanded bricks, and gave no ſtraw, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed duty, when at the ſame time they are excluded by God, Therefore ſay they, this caſteth into the bottom of deſpair, for the troubled heart may think I am none of thoſe that are given to Chriſt, though I pray and ſeek for pardon, yet I may be a dog and not a childe, and ſo none of the Childrens bread be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to me; To this we eaſily anſwer, that all thoſe who thus repent of ſinne and ſeek after Gods favour, they are to be aſhamed that this is an effect of their being given to Chriſt, as you heard, <hi>Joh.</hi> 18.6. To be given unto Chriſt is indeed a ſecret Myſtery tranſacted in heaven, but to come unto Chriſt, that is the ſure effect of thoſe that are given to him, and <hi>thoſe that come to Chriſt he will in no wiſe caſt out</hi>; So that the grieved contrite ſpirit ought to be ſo far from having any trouble herein, that he ought exceedingly to rejoyce at it, for the efficacy of all the promiſes will be to ſuch, <hi>They are bleſſed that hunger and thirſt after Righteouſneſſe,</hi> Mat. 5.</p>

No cauſe to doubt of Gods accepting of Chriſts Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.</note>Thirdly, <hi>Hence it is that there is no cauſe of doubt to be made by the people of God, whether God the Father will accept of Chriſts Mediation for them, for it is as amongſt men</hi>; as if he ſhould offer to lay down a ſufficient prize to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem ſuch a captive, conſidering that all this agreement came originally from the Father; So that Chriſt ſaith, The Father gave him theſe to he a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour to them, yea, that the Father loveth him, becauſe he laid down his life for his Sheep: This followeth unqueſtionably, that whom Chriſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents to his Father, the Father will not refuſe; Oh then ſtand and admire at the felicity which the Scripture hath aſſured thee of; Thoſe whom Chriſt brings to the Father, it was his will and antecedent purpoſe that Chriſt ſhould mediate, and is there any doubt then whether God the Father will embrace thee or no?</p>

forſaken both of God and man, ſo then ſtand and admire the terms upon which theſe are given to Chriſt, God the Father ſaith thus to him, I will that thou procure the ſalvation of theſe men, but it can be no otherwiſe then by thy own bloud, whatſoever curſes juſtice would have inflicted on them, thou muſt undergo; Oh the tongue of men and Angels is not able to expreſſe this; Were we not ſuch cold clods of earth, this love of Chriſt would ſet our hearts all on fire, who would not part with his luſts, with his ſins, for Chriſt who hath thus loved us to the death of the Croſſe? Shall he part with his bloud, and wilt not thou with a ſinne which will breed nothing but torment hereafter? Though it be now honey in thy mouth, yet it will be gravell in the belly.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>This ſuppoſeth the ſecurity and ſafety of the godly,</hi> Nothing can hinder them of this ſalvation, <hi>Our life is hid with Chriſt in God,</hi> Col. 3.3.<note place="margin">2.

To ſay that Chriſt ſhould loſe any of thoſe jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els that were put into his cuſtody? indeed if our ſalvation and happineſſe were in our keeping, we ſhould be prodigal of it every day, we are found unfaithful in every temptation, but ſo is not Chriſt: As he is yea and Amen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <p>He is an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite object.</p>
               </note> though ſpirituall and immaterial, yet ſo farre as ſeeing doth imply enjoying and immediate fruition of God, ſo farre they are ſure to partake of it; Now then conſider how great a mercy this is, To have God the Object of all our love, joy, and delight, <hi>For he only is that univerſal and infinite object which can ſatiate and comfort the heart</hi>: All theſe earthly comforts they are too nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, too little for the ſoul: Divines ſay, The ſoul of a man hath an infinite ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, it deſireth this, and it deſireth that, and nothing but God is ſuch an u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal good that can fully repleniſh it; Now <hi>David</hi> even in this life he ſaith, <hi>Whom have I in heaven and earth but thee?</hi> Pſa. 13.35. how much rather will this be true in heaven? God is the center of the ſoul, it is unquiet and reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe till it fix there: Take all the men in the world, who have drunk deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in the ſtreams of theſe earthly comforts, yet ſtill they thirſt; There is a dropſie on them, ſtill they would have more and other objects, They have a feavori<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

From hence it is that the godly do ſo long for this time of enjoying him, <hi>I deſire to depart,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> Phil. 2.23. The Church cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for Chriſt to <hi>Come quickly</hi>: Thoſe Patriarchs looked on themſelves as Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims, and deſiring a <hi>better City</hi> then that of this world; ſo then you can but judge of this happineſſe by the footſteps, by the drops of it; If there be any attractive good in the creature, it's but a drop, God the Fountain he is the Ocean: Now in this object God enjoyed, there are theſe remarkable properties of his goodneſſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>He is the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal good,</hi> he is the <hi>bonum in qua omnia bona,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He is the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal good.</note> There cannot be any deſirable perfection but it is in him; The Creatures have their particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar limited goodneſſe, health hath its, wealth hath its, learning its, but now God is the <hi>Jehovah,</hi> all beings are eminently in him; As the Pſalmiſt argueth, <hi>He that made the eye, ſhall not he ſee? he that made the ear, ſhall not he hear?</hi> Pſal. 94.9. He then that makes this and that thing deſirable, is not he much more deſirable? Is there a ground to love Father, Mother, Wife, or Children, and not much rather to love God? ſo that that Command <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. hath the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt reaſon, where God willeth to be loved <hi>with all the heart, all the ſoul, all the might</hi>; for there is nothing hath any good which is the Object of love, but it's in God, or from him, <hi>There is none good but God</hi> ſaith Chriſt, ſo then what are Stars to the Sunne? The Starres cannot diſpell the night, only the light of the Sun can do that; Thus only God and the light of his countenance can make the heart happy, as having all things.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That good which God is, it is an unmixed ſincere good</hi>;<note place="margin">He is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed ſincere good.</note> He is ſo good that there is no trouble in him, for that is the imperfection of all earthly good things, as there is a drop of honey, ſo there is a drop of gall; Every Roſe hath its thorn; If God gives thee any mercy in this life, yet ſtill there is a ſting as well as hony, ſo that no condition, no mercy hath every thing in it; Though they have this, yet they want another, and hence <hi>Solomon</hi> who gave himſelf to finde out this Philoſophers ſtone, to obtain an happineſſe if it could be in this world, yet upon experience he giveth this Motto of every thing, <hi>Vanity of vanities, all is vanity</hi> Eccl. 1.1.

in heaven? Of this honey in the world we muſt not eat too much leſt we ſurfet; But there is fullneſſe without nauſeating; There is repleniſhing and yet alwaies hungring, God is as much deſired after millions of years as at the firſt moment in heaven; Hence this life is to be ſpent only in joy, in praiſes, and gladneſſe of heart; Oh that we could affect our hearts more with this eternal life, it would be a great comfort in afflictions, and a quick ſpur to all duties.</p>

            <p>Come we in the next place to the <hi>properties of this life,</hi>
               <note place="margin">And it hath theſe proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</note> for we can better ſpeak of them then the life it ſelf, as we can better look upon the Sun-beams then the Sun it ſelf.</p>

            <p n="1">1. Occurrent adverſities, contrary miſeries, our health is taken away by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes, our wealth by poverty, our hopes by fears, ſo that every mans life hath more gall then hony.</p>
            <p>And 2. If there were no oppoſite calamity, as there was not to <hi>Adam,</hi> yet there is a naturall intermiſſion of it by ſleep, ſo that if we were never ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, yet as often as we ſleep our Sun would be ecclipſed, but this happy life we ſpeak of admits of neither of theſe Interruptions; There cannot be any miſery or grief there, for <hi>God will waſh away all tears from their eyes,</hi> and it muſt needs be ſo, becauſe all the cauſe of miſery which is ſinne, is there taken away, ſo that as there cannot be any thunder or lightning in the upper Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, becauſe the vapours which are the materials of it cannot aſcend ſo high, can have no entrance there, ſo becauſe no unclean thing, no ſinful thing can enter heaven, therefore no evil, no miſery, or affliction can come there; This ſhould make us all deſpiſe this valley of tears for that Mount of Viſion or tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figuration, What is this Wilderneſſe to that <hi>Canaan?</hi> What are theſe husks to that Manna? Why are we ſo hardly plucked out of this world that hath ſo many thorns and troubles with it, to enter into heaven? where there is no grief, no complaining or diſcontent at all.</p>
            <p>Again, <hi>There is not the ſecond intermiſſion of this happineſſe</hi>; for there is no night, no ſleep nor drouſineſſe, but it is a waking, joyful life to all Eternity: Alas, if here we ſhould have the moſt deſirable comforts that can be, yet we would call for a time to ſleep, they could not keep us alive without this bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily Rect; but there the body is made ſo glorious a body that it's no more capable of ſleep, then it is of hunger or thirſt; Oh then happy and thrice hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py is that life where thou ſhalt not for a moment be taken off from God. It's impoſſible for the godly in this life to have an actual love and complacency in God, never to be diſtracted or diverted by other thoughts, ſomething or other comes and ſteals the heart away, and laieth the dead childe in the room of the living one, but then we ſhall have a conſtant intuitive beholding of God, and nothing ſhall withdraw us from him, Thus it is not to be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted.</p>

it is not one or two, or twenty good things can make a man happy, but there muſt be all things; And for this reaſon it is that the Scripture hath ſo many variety of reſemblances to repreſent this bleſſedneſſe; To ſhew you, that it hath all deſirable things; It's called a <hi>Kingdom,</hi> a <hi>Crown of glory,</hi> a <hi>Feaſt and Banquet,</hi> a place of joy; Heaven is ſaid to be paved with all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſtones; Now why doth the Scripture uſe ſuch expreſſions?

               <note place="margin">6. It's an eternall life.</note>ETernal life in the nature and ſome properties of it hath been treated on; There remains one more, which I ſhall mention, <hi>viz.</hi> that in the Text <hi>Eternall</hi>; Therefore take the beſt wine at the laſt, That which crowneth all, and without which whatſoever happineſſe or glory might be had, it would in time fall as the leaf from the Tree, and this is <hi>Eternity</hi>; And here again we muſt be more in our acclamations and divine amazements at it then deſcriptions of it. The Schoolmen they tell us, that Eternity is like a fixed ſtarre now, whoſe whole is altogether; There is no ſucceſſion, no for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer or latter in Eternity, but all is together: I ſhall not perplex you with ſuch intricacies, Eternity it ſelf being only a fit ſpace to know what Eternity is This only take notice of, That a thing may be ſaid to be eternal in a twofold ſence, 1. Abſolutely and ſimply, ſo that it hath neither beginning or ending, and thus only God is eternal. Thus <hi>Deut.</hi> 33.27. God is called <hi>the Eternall God</hi>: Or elſe Eternal is uſed for that which had a beginning but never ſhall have an end, this is called <hi>Eternum a poſteriori</hi>; and ſo this bleſſed life is called eternal, for although it had a beginning, yet it ſhall never have an end, but after millions and millions of imaginary years, they are to continue in this life, as if it were the firſt moment; Let us then conſider as much as we are able what an infinite and incomprehenſible happineſs this is, which ſhall be for ever, <hi>Then ſhall we be with the Lord for ever,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Theſ. 4.17. Who is not put into extaſies and raptures, while he ſeriouſly meditateth on theſe things? Alas in this life if we had the confluence of all deſirable comforts, yet becauſe our life is ſhort and uncertain, our joy alſo can be no longer; But there, whatſoever glory thou doſt once partake of, thou ſhalt never loſe it; It will be thy Crown for ever, thy Kingdom for ever, thy glory is ever laſting glory; O the depth and unſearchableneſſe of this grace and love of God: well might Chriſt ſay, he would <hi>give it,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> call Eternal Life <hi>the gift of God,</hi> Rom. 6.23. For who can think that theſe duties which we do here are meritorious of ſuch eternal glory, for grant they were perfect, and had no droſſe in them, yet there is no proportion in the time, for thy faith, thy repentance, they were tranſient acts, ſuch as do paſſe way, but this Eternity abideth for ever. So in that it is eternal, the freeneſſe of it is neceſſarily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied; What hath a cup of cold water given in the Name of Chriſt of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignity
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:65216:47"/>
with an eternal reward: Oh then that by faith we could fix our hearts upon this eternal life, that we could ſay, what do we here? What is this life that we now live to that eternal life? Why have I not this more in my thoughts and deſires? Why do I not riſe and go to bed with hungrings and thirſtings after this? eſpecially let wicked men, who for to fulfill every baſe and unworthy luſt, loſe this eternal life, to go home weeping and how<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ing, and making bitter Lamentations; For they for a luſt that paſſeth in a moment, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do themſelves to all Eternity.</p>
            <p>Thus you have heard the properties of it:<note place="margin">II. Eternal Life conſidered comparatively with this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent life.</note> In the next place conſider it <hi>comparatively with this preſent life,</hi> and you will ſee what a Mole-bill is to the vaſt heavens, that is, this life to eternal life.</p>
            <p>For 1. <hi>This life is but ſhort, fading, and fleeth away as a ſhadow</hi>; It's not a life but a ſhadow of a life; We live but in a dream, We act a life upon a Stage, There is but a life repreſented not really lived;<note place="margin">1. This life is but ſhort.</note> Hence the Scripture uſeth ſo many ſimilitudes to expreſſe this nothing; Sometimes this life is called <hi>a flower,</hi> Pſa. 90. which though ſweet for a while, preſently dieth; Sometimes a <hi>Floud,</hi> that makes a ſudden noiſe, and is immediately ſwallowed up in the earth; Sometimes to a <hi>bubble,</hi> to a <hi>vapour,</hi> to a <hi>ſhadow,</hi> to a <hi>threed</hi>: Now why are all theſe expreſſions? but to tell us. This life is no life, it deſerveth not the name of a life, and yet as poor and ſhort as it is, what an imbred de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire have we to it? <hi>Skin for skin, and all that we have we would exchange for it</hi>; how welcome then and deſired ſhould eternal life be, which compared with this life, is like the Ocean to a drop? Now lay up both theſe lives together, this fading moment, and that enduring Eternity, and admire the madneſſe of wicked men, who ſay, Give me this life, Let me here live in my pleaſures and luſts, though I be deprived of eternal life, This fooliſh choice is made by eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry wicked man.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>This life as it is ſhort ſo it is full of troubles and miſeries;</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Full of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries.</note> 
               <hi>Few and evil have my daies been,</hi> ſaid <hi>Jacob,</hi> Gen. 49.9. though a godly man who had ſometimes the preſence of God immediatly refreſhing him in this Pilgrimage. It hath been the ſaying of ſome, That if they were to live the life they have lived, over again; They would not accept of ſuch an offer, becauſe the water of it hath been more then the wine, the gall then the honey: Hence <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, <hi>Man that is born of a woman is for adverſity as the ſparks fly upwards,</hi> Job 5.7. Nothing is ſo connatural and proper for man as to be miſerable: Compare then Eternity with this where all evil is done away: Nothing but glory and fulneſſe of abundance; Eternal and happy may the Saints glorified ſay, their daies are; Yet here again is a great diſcovery of every wicked mans madneſſe, To have a few evil daies, wherein thou haſt more vexation then comfort, thou wilt loſe this eternal bleſſed life, and if thou ſaiſt, I hope not ſo, I do not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to do ſo, that will not avail thee, for this eternal life is vouchſafed to none, but thoſe that repent of, and wholly forſake their ſinnes; Never then blinde thy eyes, and delude thy ſelf with vain hopes; Thou for thy ſinnes ſake doſt voluntarily refuſe this eternal life.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>This life is full of fears,</hi> We are obnoxious unto death from principles of corruption within, as alſo from violence without;<note place="margin">3. Full of fears.</note> So that if we could ſuppoſe an univerſal good in this life, That we had mercies and no ſorrow mingled with them, yet the fear of loſing them or our death no longer to enjoy them, may juſtly be the death in the pot, or the root of bitterneſſe in all our joys: There is no ground we can ſhadow our ſelves under, but a worm will ariſe either from it, or from our ſelves, or God will create one to deſtroy it, ſo that when all things are to our hearts deſire, yet we are not able to ſay, I fear not the loſſe of it, neither death, or the violence of man can deprive me of it, but ſtill we are ſubject every moment to an alteration, ſet we then this eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal

life by it, and there we ſhall ſee how glorious that is comparatively, for as there is an univerſal good, ſo there is a quiet, full, and ſecure poſſeſſion of it; There is no danger from within or from without: <hi>Adam</hi> though created happy, yet was mutable, The devil ſeduced him out of all his felicity; but now there is a confirmation of the Saints in heaven, if once in poſſeſſion of glory there cannot be any to eject them, unleſſe there could be a ſtronger then God: It's not ſo much happineſſe as ſecurity in happineſſe that makes a man bleſſed, Fear to loſe it takes off from the enjoying of it, but it's not ſo with this eternal life, There is all quietneſſe, all ſecurity, and eaſe, and certainly if the Apoſtle <hi>Rom</hi> 8. even in this life can make ſuch a glorious charge: <hi>Who ſhall ſeparate us from the love of God through Chriſt? Neither death, nor things preſent, nor things to come.</hi> How much more ſhall they in heaven triumph after this manner? If thoſe that are toſſed up and down in the Sea have ſuch ſecurity, what may they have who are in the haven? Upon this account it is that our Saviour bids them <hi>treaſure up that wealth,</hi> Mat. 6.20. <hi>where theeves cannot break through and ſteal</hi>; By that he means no ſecret craft or open violence can get away that treaſure; Here again we ſee the madneſſe of wicked and earthly men; They venture their ſouls, and God, and heaven and all to get this uncertain wealth, theſe uncertain pleaſures, which when they have they may fear every moment that voice from heaven; <hi>Thou Fool, this night thy ſoul ſhall be taken from thee</hi>; Thus they do when a ſecure, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and permanent treaſure is to be tendered to them: It's a rule which all commend for the wiſedom of it, <hi>Tene certum, &amp; dimitte incertum,</hi> and this they will keep too in earthly affairs, but then for heaven and eternal happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, there they are devoid of all underſtanding.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <note place="margin">4.

            <p>ETernall Life is the glorious gift mentioned in the Text, and though I was concluding this verſe, yet the conſideration of this glorious matter ſhall make me once more endeavour throughly to poſſeſs your hearts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. It was the fault of one of the Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> that he did not ſtrike arrows often enough to the ground, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 13.19. for then he ſhould have obtained more victories. It ſhall therefore be my endeavour, if poſſible, that the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows of this truth may be ſtricken often even through and through your hearts. And that I may further quicken you hereunto, conſider theſe particulars, as ſo many effectuall concluſions upon this ſubject.</p>
            <p>And firſt,<note place="margin">1. The great queſtion that all ought to put is, How may I have eternall life?</note> 
               <hi>The chief and moſt principall and neceſſary queſtion which every one ſhould ſeriouſly propound, ought to be that</hi> Luk. 18.18. <hi>What ſhall I do to inherit eternall life?</hi> Not indeed upon ſuch a corrupt opinion as he did, who thought by his own works meerly to obtain this eternall life; No, that cannot be, it's the gift of God: and when we have done all, this eternall life is of grace, not merit, but in a right ſenſe, <hi>viz.</hi> what way ought we to walk in, what is to be done that at laſt we may not eternally periſh. This (I ſay) is a moſt noble and neceſſary queſtion, if this were more ſtudied and practiſed, it would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage the ſoul ten thouſand times more then other unneceſſary and imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent diſputations. The beſt method in morall Philoſophy is to begin firſt with the end, becauſe that is the chiefeſt, there muſt be firſt a knowledge and deſire of that: Now all Divinity agreeth with morall Philoſophy in this, it's wholly practicall. The firſt thing then in your thoughts and meditations ſhould be, What is that end for which I was made? how may I obtain that eternall life for
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:65216:50"/>
which I came into this world? Oh why are we buſie in unneceſſary things? for what end and purpoſe were you made? Was it to heap up wealth? To ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the luſts and pleaſures of the fleſh? No, it was at laſt to injoy this eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life. The Heathen did well call man the orizon of time and eternity; for in reſpect of his body, he partaketh of time, in reſpect of his ſoul eternity: So then the chief and more excellent part of thee, that which makes thee differ from a beaſt, it is that which relateth to eternity, ſo that the firſt and the laſt thing thou haſt to think on is, how to come to this eternall life. The Apoſtle uſeth an emphaticall word, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.12. <hi>Lay hold on eternall life</hi>; as a man that runneth in a race, at the end thereof ſtreacheth out himſelf to lay hold on the garland; ſo that as he who runneth in a race neglects all the pleaſant objects he runneth by, and hath his eye only upon the prize: Thus it ought to be with us, neither riches, honours, friends or earthly advantages ought to be inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately minded by us, but eternall life that is the prize, upon that our eye is to be, after that we are to pray and ſtrive: But who may not blame himſelf, and judge himſelf for neglect herein? Oh how little is this eternall life in thy affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and hopes; thy cares about thy body, about thy eſtate will greatly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn that ſluggiſhneſs about eternall life.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <note place="margin">2. We muſt take the right way to anſwer that queſtion.</note>2. <hi>As this ought to be the great queſtion we are to riſe with and go to bed with, ſo we muſt take the right way to anſwer it.</hi> It's not enough to make the queſtion as <hi>Pilate</hi> did to Chriſt, <hi>What truth was?</hi> and never matter an anſwer; but we are to be reſtleſſe in our ſouls till we have a full anſwer, till we know the way. Now that we can only be inſtructed in from Gods Word, <hi>John</hi> 6.68. <hi>Whither ſhall we go, thou haſt the words of eternall life.</hi> The Scripture then is this Tree of Life, the fruit thereof and the leaves likewiſe are for eternall healing. Hence our Saviour in the next verſe tels us, what is the way to have this eternall life, even by knowing of God and Jeſus Chriſt. As all the Heathens were in dark confuſed thoughts about immortallity, ſo they were in Egyptian darkneſſe, or like the blinde Sodomites, groping and feeling for a way to it, but could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver get in. Wouldſt thou therefore be reſolved in this, How may I have this eternall life, betake thy ſelf then to the Scriptures, make them thy counſellers; do not attend to the waies of the world, matter not what they ſay, or what they do, for that telleth thee the way to heaven is clean contrary to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and practiſes of the world. If you do not rectifie your ſelf by the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and reſolve to follow the light of this ſtarre, though you ſhould hear many hundred Sermons of eternall life, yet they would do you no good; ſay then, let me conſider what way the Scripture would put me into, my life I yet live is wholly repugnant to Gods Word, whatſoever courſe that preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth, though never ſo contrary to my luſts, to my former practiſes, yet I will gladly renounce all. Do this and then expect eternall life.</p>

Oh the ſearchings and turnings of heart this particular ſhould make in you; My everlaſting condition, that eſtate which is to be for ever and ever, it wholly hangs upon this uncertain life. It may be thou haſt but a day, an hour to live longer, and all thy eternity depends on this: Oh men fooliſh and unwiſe, who will not lay theſe things more to heart. God hath given us a candle to work by, a ſhort day we have to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, and if this paſſe over thy head, then comes unchangeable eternity. As at thy death thou art caſt for eternall life or everlaſting torments, ſo it muſt be without ever any recovery or alteration. Oh how precious ſhould thy time be, how dear ſhould every day every hour be, all this hath influence into eternity. Well might the Apoſtle, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.16. command us to redeem the time. Time is the moſt precious jewell in the world, eternity depends on it,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:65216:50"/>
and therefore wilt thou let thy luſts or wicked companions ſteal away this jewel that is more worth then all the world? Oh let us ſo live every day, every hour as thoſe that ſay, as I do now, ſo will eternity be to me.</p>

Many periſh in the broad way, few enter in the ſtrait way: What will make thee caſt off preſumption, ſecurity and negligence, if this do not? The number of thoſe who ſhall have this eternall life is very few, a little flock they are comparatively to thoſe many millions that are caſt into everlaſting flames. Oh how long ſhall we hear theſe things and yet be void of all ſpirituall underſtanding. If ſuch an aſſeveration ſhould be uſed concerning any temporall miſery or calamity, Many ſhall dye of the plague, few ſhall eſcape; Many ſhall be cut off by famine or the ſword, and a very few ſhall be preſerved, who would not fear leſt he ſhould be one of the many?

               <hi>as if thou wert already in eternity:</hi> For if the damned in hell that ſee no eſcape from thoſe everlaſting flames were asked, what they thought of their ſinne, how they loved it? would they not make miſerable howlings, it's that which hath undone us, oh that is the ſting that enters into the very bowels, that's the ſcorpion which pierceth to the very heart: Oh we mad men and void of all underſtanding, who though forewarned of this, and threatned about it, yet regarded nothing, beleeved nothing; but now, oh now, after millions of years in this tormented place, we are as unlikely to come out, as at the firſt. Think you they are not then altered and changed, do they not cry out of thoſe bitter ſinnes which were once ſo ſweet? Should God give them leave to be here again upon the earth, would they not repent in ſackcloth and aſhes? would they not day and night mourn after God and his forgiveneſſe? Oh that every wicked man, who findes pleaſure and delight in his ſinnes, would think and ſay, Do the damned in hell judge it ſo? Do they feel ſinne ſo ſweet? And thus alſo deſire to have the ſame inlarged affections and delight in God, as thoſe glorified Saints in heaven have. Doſt thou finde thy heart worldly, unruly, diſtempered, ſay, Do thoſe in eternall life rejoyce no more? have they no more enlivened flames of zeal for God then I have? Thus to judge as thoſe who are in eternity, would be an excellent ſpurre to all piety.</p>

If the gout, the ſtone be thus grievous, what is everlaſting torment? Should not we judge him a mad man, that to have one night of quiet reſt and ſweet ſleep, would all his life after be tormented with reſtleſſe nights and terrifying dreams? ſuch folly is in all wicked men, They to have this ſhort life of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and jollity, which is but a dream, will undo themſelves for ever in this endleſſe and eaſeleſſe wo: Oh remember this eternity is ſo incomprehenſible by thee, that when thou haſt thought and thought ten thouſand millions of imaginary years, yet it is to hold as long as at the firſt beginning. Some have repreſented it thus, Imagine, ſay they, that all that vaſt ſpace which is between heaven and earth were full of ſand, and once in every thouſand year, no oftner, a bird carry away one crum of it in her bill, what a long while would it be ere this vaſt huge heap would be carried quite away; yet if the damned in hell might have eaſe at the period of ſuch a time, though ſo infinitely long, yet there would be ſome hope; but now it's everlaſting fire, it's a fire that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be quenched, but as long as God is God, ſo long ſhall they be in their chains of darkneſſe. God you heard was properly eternall, becauſe he had neither beginning or end; therefore he was ſaid by the Heathens to be a circle, whoſe center was every where, his circumference no where. Hence the Heathens repreſented his eternity by a ſnake, or a ring, that hath no begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning or end. The Romans built their Temples round, and <hi>Pythagoras</hi> rule was when to worſhip, turn thy ſelf round: Here they had confuſed notions about eternity; but the Scripture doth moſt clearly affirm his eternity: Now our life is eternall only becauſe it ſhall have no end, and ſo for the future it will abide for ever, and never change: What a great word is this, never to change; thy happineſſe will never change, thy miſery will never change.

            <p>The duty is <hi>To know.</hi> Among other diſtinctions, this is very obvious in Scripture to ſpeak of a twofold knowledge.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That which is meerly <hi>ſpeculative</hi> and <hi>apprehenſive; If ye know theſe things, happy are you if ye do them,</hi> Joh. 13.17.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Which is <hi>practicall</hi> and operative, for it's a known Rule, that among the Hebrews, <hi>Words of Knowledge are put for all the affections and effects that uſe to follow ſuch Knowledge</hi>; Thus God is ſaid <hi>to know the way of the righteous</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Pſa. 1. That is, ſo to know as to approve and preſerve the righteous, and in this ſence <hi>To know the true God</hi> is taken ſo to know as to do all thoſe things that are commanded by him, and the reaſon why the Scripture comprehends all under knowledge, is, becauſe this is the Introduction and gate to all practicall piety: Although to know here is more particularly taken for <hi>beleeving,</hi> for it's a good Rule that Divines have, whereas Faith hath three acts ingredient to it: 1. <hi>Knowledge.</hi> 2. <hi>Aſſent.</hi> 3. <hi>Fiducial application.</hi> The Scripture de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribeth the whole nature of Faith ſometimes by one act, ſometimes by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: In other places it's deſcribed by <hi>aſſent,</hi> and moſt frequently by <hi>truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> but here by <hi>knowledge</hi>; For whereas the Papiſts would make ignorance rather of the definition of faith then knowledge, they ſhew plainly what an ignorant faith and Religion they would have people take up with.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond place there is the object which is twofold, 1. <hi>The only true God.</hi> 2. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> That is both God in reſpect of his nature and attributes, oppoſitely to thoſe Heathens who worſhiped Idols; and 2. Jeſus Chriſt, that is oppoſite to the Jews, who knew the true God but not Chriſt, and withall that the knowing of the true God as a Creator by the creatures is nothing at all without the latter: It muſt be, as he is Father in Chriſt, ſo that hereby is implied that the knowing of God abſolutely is not ſaving, it muſt be relative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the glorious diſpenſation and myſtery which is by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not explain further on this, only remove an Argument which the Arians and Socinians uſe to triumph in from this Text as their <hi>Achilles</hi>;<note place="margin">

                  <p>The Text vindicated.</p>
               </note> Oh ſay they here it's plain; That Chriſt is not a true God, becauſe they are diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed; God is the only true God, and therefore Chriſt is not; But this is abſurd, That the only true God is oppoſed to Idols and to the heatheniſh gods which were worſhiped by them, in which ſence he is ſometimes called <hi>The Holy One of Iſrael,</hi> and not to Chriſt, for if he were not God likewiſe how could eternal life be ſaid to be both in knowing of God and Chriſt, and that Chriſt is truly God, take inſtead of many, two undeniable places, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.5. <hi>Of whom after the fleſh came Chriſt, who is over all God bleſſed for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more</hi>; And the other which is an excellent Comment upon this place, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.20. <hi>We are in him that is true, even in his Sonne Jeſus Chriſt; This is the true God, and eternal life</hi>; and then addeth, <hi>Keep your ſelves from Idols</hi>; So that God the Father is the true God and Chriſt the Son is the true God, and all other made gods are Idols.</p>
            <p>This Anſwer is ſufficient, and indeed the Socinians themſelves may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, for they grant this Rule, that the word <gap reason="foreign">

the <hi>incluſa</hi> or ſubordinate, for they acknowledge Chriſt to be truly God, though not eſſentially; Whereas by their Argument Chriſt as true God ſhould be excluded, and nothing is more ordinary then to uſe the word <hi>ſolus,</hi> not to exclude what is concomitant or homogeneall but diverſe, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.16. <hi>None knoweth the Father but the Sonne,</hi> where the Father himſelf is not excluded, nor the holy Ghoſt, for it's ſaid, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.11. <hi>None knoweth the things of God but the Spirit</hi>; Others of old made this order of the words, <hi>To know thee and Jeſus Chriſt whom thou haſt ſent,</hi> to be the true God, but this may ſeem too much forced.

Thus in Popery they do ſinfully nouriſh people in their ignorant praiers, for ſeeing their praiers are in Latine, it's all one whether they pray good matter or blaſphemy; The Apoſtle 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. doth expreſly argue againſt praying in an unknown tongue, ſaying for himſelf, <hi>He will pray in the ſpirit, and with underſtanding alſo.</hi> What terrour then doth this proclaim? ignorant people, pray they cannot, they do not, no not when they pray; If that Queſtion ſhould be put to them which <hi>Philip</hi> put to the <hi>Eunuch, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtandeſt thou what thou readeſt?</hi> So Underſtandeſt thou what thou praieſt?

            <p>THe Doctrine obſerved was, that without the knowledge of God and Chriſt there cannot be any eternal life obtained; The firſt ground or reaſon of this was from thoſe ſeveral duties that are required of us towards God, which without ſome knowledge could never be acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptably performed.</p>

From thoſe duties we owe unto Chriſt.</note>The ſecond ground <hi>ſhall be from thoſe duties we owe to Chriſt</hi>; And herein damnable ignorance will farre ſooner poſſeſſe us then in the former, for there are ſome common notions and dictates about a god, which made <hi>Tertullian</hi> cry out, <hi>O animam naturaliter Chriſtianam</hi>; But in reſpect of Chriſt, we have not the leaſt implanted notion about him, ſo that the doctrine of Chriſt is far more ſupernatural then that about God, for the <hi>hoti quod ſi Deus</hi> is, I diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by natural light, but who he is, and how to be worſhiped this is meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſupernatural, but concerning Chriſt both the <hi>quod ſit</hi> and the <hi>quid ſit</hi>: That there is a Chriſt, and what he is are both by divine manifeſtation; So that whatſoever we have of Chriſt, it muſt only be by the Revelation of God, and in this reſpect though moſt people may have ſome generall appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions about God, yet about Chriſt they have none at all unleſſe by hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay: It behoveth us therefore who are called Chriſtians to know what that Chriſt is whom we worſhip, and truſt in for ſalvation, and the great igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Chriſt is preſent death; He is the <hi>door,</hi> he is the <hi>truth,</hi> the <hi>way,</hi> and the <hi>life,</hi> Joh. 14.6.

            <p>For 1. <hi>Where this ignorance of Chriſt is, there cannot be any hiſtorical faith,</hi> which is the leaſt degree of faith that can be, and where there is no hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical faith there cannot be any juſtifying, for how can a man truſt in Chriſt for ſalvation, whom he doth not beleeve to be, ſo that hiſtorical, or as ſome

call it dogmaticall faith, whereby we beleeve that there was a Chriſt both God and man, is the firſt ſtone that muſt be laid in our Chriſtian building, and without this we have not ſo much as learned the Alphabet of our Religion, yet this is the caſe of thouſands that have no explicit formal faith in this funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Point, I grant they have a traditional forme, whereby they ſay they beleeve in Chriſt, but they have no expreſſe faith concerning the perſon and natures of Chriſt; Now that traditional form is not a reaſonable worſhip of God, as the Scripture expreſſeth it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. where we are commanded to <hi>give up our ſelves as reaſonable ſacrifices,</hi> But here men are as bruit beaſts in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of any expreſſe, formal faith, inſomuch that hundreds of people if they be asked what they beleeve concerning Chriſt, they cannot give any know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or expreſſe anſwer; Oh how near are ſuch fooliſh and ſtupid perſons to the very brink of hell<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="2">2. <hi>Where groſſe Ignorance is, if there cannot be hiſtorical Faith about Chriſt, much leſſe can there be ſaving and juſtifying Faith, a fiducial relying and reſting of the ſoul upon him as the Mediatour appointed by God</hi>: The Scripture doth of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſpeak <hi>that we are juſtified by faith,</hi> Rom. 5.1. that we have <hi>remiſſion of ſinnes through Faith in Chriſts bloud,</hi> Rom. 3.25. So that Juſtification and Faith are inſeparably joyned together, but where ignorance of Chriſt is, there cannot be any of this ſaving faith, for can any man truſt in that which he doth not know of; yea, though ſuch ignorant men ſay they truſt in Chriſt, yet becauſe they know not Chriſt, theſe are but traditional and cuſtomary words; They ſpeak falſly and ſay they do not know what; Philoſophers ſay there is <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctio hominis,</hi> and <hi>actio humana,</hi> an humane action is that which comes expreſly or impliedly from reaſon, but <hi>actio hominis</hi> is that which is done by a man, but not as a man, as the moving of the foot or lifting up a ſtraw which came from the imagination meerly, So truly we may ſay, there is <hi>actio Chriſtiani,</hi> and <hi>actio Chriſtiani,</hi> a Chriſtian action is that which comes from knowledge and faith, either directly or indirectly, but that is an action of one that is a Chriſtian in name and profeſſion only, that doth ſuch actions as others doe, but not from any knowledge or faith within, only from cuſtome and meer tradition; if then knowledge be in all the hiſtoricall and juſtifying acts of Faith, where ſhall the ſtupid and ignorant man appear?</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>The groſſe ignorant man cannot admire, bleſſe, and praiſe God for Jeſus Chriſt the Medtatour</hi>; This is evident, he that knoweth not the nature, office, and uſe of Chriſt, what he was, and why he came into the world, what was that which he did for us, it's impoſſible he ſhould ever be affected with the love of God, or with the love of Chriſt, This made the Apoſtle pray that they might know <hi>the breadth and depth of the love of God through Chriſt,</hi> Eph. 3. For without this knowledge all Gods love and Chriſts love is diſregarded; We reade of <hi>Pauls</hi> divine raptures, and holy extaſies, becauſe of Chriſt, <hi>I deſire to know nothing but Jeſus Chriſt and him crucified,</hi> 2 Cor. 2.2. It is impoſſible in a lively manner to know this divine truth of God the Fathers love in ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his only begotten Sonne to die for us, and not break out in heavenly praiſes and admirations, but the blinde ignorant man ſeeth nothing of this admirable myſtery; As he ſaid, it fell out ill with Artificers, when ignorant men judged of their works; Thus certainly God loſeth much of his glory-Chriſt
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:65216:56"/>
much of his honour, when ignorant men only ſpeak of this Doctrine, As Chriſt <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. ſaid to the woman of <hi>Samaria, If thou hadſt known who it is ſpeaketh to thee, thou wouldeſt have asked for the water of Life</hi>; So here, if thou hadſt known what is in this love of God and Chriſt, if thy heart did medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate and ſtudy on it, thou wouldſt be more affected and enlarged in thy affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Where groſſe Ignorance is of Christ, there cannot be any improving of him for all theſe bleſſed effects to which he is appointed by God. Chriſt is of God unto us wiſedom, righteouſneſſe, and ſanctification,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. <hi>Of his Fulneſſe we all receive grace for grace,</hi> Joh. 3. But the ignorant and unwiſe man cannot make any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of this, The ignorant man knoweth not the vertue and good uſe may be made of ſuch herbs as grow in the field, but the wiſe Artiſt doth, <hi>Solomon</hi> asketh, <hi>Why is a price put into the hands of a Fool, ſeeing he knoweth not how to make uſe of it?</hi> If the man in the Parable that found a Pearl had not known it to be a Pearl, he would not have ſold all to have bought it; So then let there be never ſo much fulneſſe and ſufficiency in Chriſt, yet he is a <hi>Fountain ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up, and a garden encloſed</hi> to the ignorant man, and this muſt neceſſarily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude ſuch from heaven, becauſe in Chriſt is all our ſalvation, whatſoever conduceth to our happineſſe is bound up in him, now the ignorant man not knowing this treaſure muſt needs periſh in his ſinnes.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Where a man is ignorant of Chriſt, he muſt needs be in a damnable condition, becauſe thereby he is alſo ignorant of himſelf,</hi> he knoweth not his own ſinfulneſſe and miſery, and ſo cannot deſire a remedy: Theſe two are neceſſarily known together, or unknown, Chriſt the Phyſician, and ſinne a deſperate diſeaſe; Chriſt a Saviour, and the ſinner that is loſt; But the ignorant man not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the one muſt neceſſarily have the other hid from his eyes: Can there be any hope of that mans cure who knoweth not and feels not his diſeaſe? Thy Ignorance of Chriſt argueth thou art alſo ignorant of thy ſelf, for didſt thou know thy own poverty and guilt, nothing could hold thee till thou mightſt get ſome intereſt in Chriſt, pain of body will make a man cry out for eaſe, but pain of ſoul through ſinne, much more; Thus you ſee the ignorant man is in the plain way to hell.</p>

               <note place="margin">III. Becauſe groſſe Ignorance is immediatly oppoſite to the means that bring the ſoul to God and Chriſt.</note>Thirdly, <hi>Groſſe Ignorance muſt needs be damnable, becauſe it's immediatly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to the ſanctified and appointed means that bring to God and Christ,</hi> viz. <hi>the Miniſtery</hi>: The Preaching of the Word is inſtituted by God to bring us to underſtanding and faith about theſe things; Therefore they are called the <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Guides</hi>; But where there is groſſe Ignorance there commonly the Preaching of the Word hath leaſt effect and fruit, as the Sunne-beams doe no good to the blinde man, For ſeeing the Word of God is a morall Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and though potent by the power of God, yet it doth by argument con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince and perſwade, where men are bruitiſh like beaſts, what improbability is there of doing good?

Take a knowing though prophane man in his life, yet we have ſomething to work upon, we ſpeak to wiſe men that will judge what we ſay, but to the blinde man day and night is all one, Preaching and no Preaching; To the deaf man Thunder and a ſtill voice is all one: Conſider then leſt thy ignorance doth not damn thee, in that all the means and inſtituted waies of God become altogether unprofitable unto thee, That makes all preaching in vain: I ſhall not further enlarge on this.</p>

            <p>KNowledge you heard is neceſſary to every mans ſalvation: We now come to diſcover what kinde of knowledge this muſt be; and as for the comprehending of <hi>Faith</hi> under that knowledge, I ſhall not treat of that notion, but referre it till further opportunity offer it ſelf in this Chapter. That therefore the knowing man may not preſently bleſſe himſelf as if his eyes were enough to carry him to heaven, though he hath no feet to walk in Gods waies: I ſhall now manifeſt what knowledge it is, and raiſe this Obſervation,</p>

               <hi>That knowledge which brings to eternal life, ought to be accompanied with the true and proper effects of it.</hi> This is grounded upon the uſe of the word <hi>know,</hi> which doth denote the <hi>affectus</hi> and <hi>effectui concomitatis,</hi> frequently in Scripture; and that this knowledge muſt be ſo here, is plain by that of our Saviour, <hi>If ye know theſe things, happy are ye if ye do them,</hi> John 13.17. Therefore meer knowledge without doing, is not happineſſe: And this we ſee the very Heathens could pitch upon, that happineſſe did not conſiſt in a ſpeculative knowledge, but in virtuous actions: Yea <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> obſerved, that <hi>a prophane diſſolute life did not corrupt ſpeculative ſciences,</hi> as Geometry and the Mathematicks, but it would immediately <hi>morall habits:</hi> So then, <hi>Knowledge with affections and good effects is that which leadeth to eternall life.</hi> Hence wicked men are many times ſaid not to know God, becauſe though they have never ſo much ſpeculative under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, yet becauſe by their lives and ungodly waies they diſhonour him, therefore they are ſaid not to know him.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. <hi>That it makes a man have a firm and divine immoveable aſſent to Scripture-truths:</hi> For if we ſhould have all the knowledge of men and Angels, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve nothing, what advantage could it be to us? There may be knowledge meerly apprehenſive, as thoſe heatheniſh Writers, <hi>Julian, Porphyrius,</hi> and others, who argued and diſputed againſt the Chriſtian Religion; in this they knew what it was, elſe they could not have diſputed againſt it, but they did not believe it to be true. The Phariſees that ſo much oppoſed Chriſt, they knew the ſenſe and meaning of this doctrine but did not believe it; ſo that if know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge be not accompanied with faith, though we had the higheſt degree of it, yet it would profit nothing. Therefore Chriſtians are not called knowing men ſo much as Believers, that is their frequent title, becauſe the firm aſſent they give to Gods truth is that which is moſt available to ſalvation. Enquire then
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:65216:58" rendition="simple:additions"/>
after thy faith, men of great knowledge are many times great Atheiſts or Scepticks; they can ſay as much for one way of Religion, as for another, and hereupon are alwaies wavering and doubting, but have no determinate fixing of the heart upon God; yea <hi>Aquinas</hi> obſerveth, that a knowing man hath more temptations againſt his faith then one more ſimple. It's well then, when with thy knowledge thy faith is alſo firm and ſtedfaſt.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. <hi>Then is thy knowledge ſaving, when the main and noble act of the will doth preſently follow,</hi> which is to chooſe and take God for our chiefeſt good, and to imbrace the goodneſſe of all thoſe things we know; for the devils they have knowledge enough, called therefore <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, becauſe of their exceeding great knowledge, yet they are moſt maliciouſly oppoſite to God, becauſe by their wils they do not chooſe and imbrace that which is good. The two main pillars of the ſoul, or the chief faculties thereof are the underſtanding and the will: The object of the underſtanding is <hi>truth,</hi> of the will is <hi>good</hi>; Now the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is to be like a torch or ſtarre to guide the will, and whatſoever the minde diſcovers to be true and good, that the will is readily to receive; ſo that then our knowledge doth attain it's proper perfection, when it prevaileth upon the will and moveth that; the underſtanding is the counſellour, the will is the Queen, if that then be moved to chooſe the good diſcovered, then hath the underſtanding obtained its end: See then how it is with thee, thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt God and Chriſt, but how, as the chiefeſt good? as to be choſen above any worldly excellency, and therefore thy will cleaveth fully to them; this is rightly to know: While ſomething is done upon the will, till that be bowed and changed, the ſtrongeſt hold ſtands out againſt God. Oh then pray, and again pray that thy knowledge may ſo farre prevail on thy will, that it ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce all other things to adhere to God only.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. <hi>This knowledge of God muſt draw out thoſe eminent affections of love, joy, delight, and fear of God.</hi> You ſee God in the Scripture is made the proper ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of all theſe affections, as if we had them for nothing but God; our love, that God will have all, <hi>Thou ſhalt love him with all the heart:</hi> and ſo for our fear, that is often required, <hi>Sanctifie the Lord God, and let him be thy dread:</hi> and we are often commanded to <hi>rejoyce in the Lord:</hi> So then ſeeing God is the proper object of theſe affections, and we may not place them any where but on him, and things relating thereunto, it behoveth us to ſee whether our knowledge do thus kindle and inflame us after God or no. Certainly it's the greateſt reaſon that our knowledge ſhould have ſuch Divine operations, for if we know God as he is revealed in his word, he is there diſcovered to be ſo great, ſo glorious, full of all goodneſſe, that we cannot but give him the ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority in all things.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 4. Another inward effect muſt be <hi>a melting, ſorrowfull and grieved heart that we have provoked God by our ſinnes:</hi> For who can but grieve and lament his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when he knoweth how great and terrible a God he hath provoked: Thus <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> after his great troubles and afflictions laid upon him, when he had prayed, mourned and humbled himſelf, it's ſaid, <hi>Then Manaſſeh knew that God was the Lord:</hi> Then he knew, not before, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 33.13. A man then truly comes to know God, when through the apprehenſion of his Majeſty and glorious power, he abhorreth himſelf, is afflicted becauſe of his rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: As you ſee when <hi>Job</hi> had a further diſcovery of Gods greatneſſe, how greatly he debaſed himſelf.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> 5. <hi>A genuine and proper effect of the knowledge of God and Chriſt, is truſt and dependance upon them.</hi> This is ſo great a matter, that it's called the juſt mans life, <hi>The juſt ſhall live by faith,</hi> Heb. 2.4. Now this grace of truſt or dependance is branched into two parts: Firſt. <hi>A truſt on God for his protection, care and providence over us:</hi> This is the truſt <hi>David</hi> doth ſo often ſpeak of in his Pſalms;
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:65216:59" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and the Prophet makes him accurſed, that <hi>makes not God his truſt,</hi> Jer. 17. The rich man truſts in his riches, the idolater in his Idols, the great man in his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, but all theſe ſet up another God beſides the true God. They that truly know God, <hi>viz.</hi> that he is the Lord of hoaſts, that he is the principall effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and all creatures are but inſtruments depending on him both <hi>quoad eſſe</hi> and <hi>operari,</hi> will quickly ſee it a ſacrilegious and idololatricall ſinne to truſt in any but the true God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9.10. <hi>They that know thy Name will truſt in thee:</hi> All our unbelief, diffidence and diſtruſt, all diſtracting cares about theſe things below, argue our want of knowledge of God: Therefore <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. when our Saviour forbids theſe dividing cares, he ſaith, <hi>All theſe do the Gentiles ſeek after</hi>; they that know not Gods power and his goodneſſe, they are ſolicitous ſinfully about theſe things. Hence when <hi>Iſrael</hi> did ſee her vanity by falſe confidences in the creatures, ſee what God ſaith of her, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 13.4. <hi>Thou ſhalt know no God but me, for there is no Saviour beſide me</hi>; and <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 8.2. <hi>Iſrael ſhall cry unto me, My God we know thee.</hi> Though therefore knowledge be better then the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt duties performed out of ignorant devotion, the ſame <hi>Hoſea</hi> 6 6. God there deſireth <hi>knowledge more then burnt offerings,</hi> yet this is but a lame imperfect knowledge, if it breed not dependance on God, as on our heavenly and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Father. The other branch of dependance is <hi>on Chriſt for Juſtification and Salvation,</hi> that is the beleeving on him which our Saviour ſo often promiſeth eternall life to: Oh when our knowledge of Chriſt and the fulneſſe and ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of a Mediator, makes us to caſt all our burden on him, and to have free acceſſe to the Throne of Grace by his bloud, this is precious knowledge. This is that <hi>excellency</hi> of knowledge <hi>Paul,</hi> Phil. 3. <hi>counted all things dung unto</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively. See then what truſt and dependance doth the knowledge of God cauſe in thee; for all thy knowledge, art thou not as full of cares, diſtractions and diffidence, as if God did not rule, as if Chriſt were not the Mediatour, as if there were no promiſes in Gods Word.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> 6. <hi>Then is our knowledge ſaving, when it makes us glorifie God as God, giving the praiſe of all things to him,</hi> Rom. 1. This the Apoſtle taxeth the Gentiles withall, that though they had a knowledge of God by the creatures, yet they did not glorifie him according to this knowledge, but they made ſenſible Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of him, and worſhipped wood and ſtone, the work of mens hands, <hi>They did not glorifie him as God</hi>; there is a great deal in that, To glorifie God as God, is ſo to honour him, as to give him the beſt and the ſupremacy in all things: When our hearts are as much upon the creature as God, or when we would ſerve God and Mamon, this is not to glorifie God as God: When we do any thing not principally and chiefly for God, we do not honour him as a God. Theſe are the inward effects of knowledge.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">II. Externall.</note>Now there are outward effects which will neceſſarily follow true and ſaving knowledge, even as the beams of the Sunne do the Sunne, though they are not called externall as oppoſite to internall, no, they both go together; for they that know God, know him to be a Spirit, and that he muſt be worſhipped in Spirit and truth, that all outward duties done without the heart, are but a meer hypocriſie; ſo that theſe outward effects are to be taken as ſtreams coming from a full and precious fountain within, and they are ſuch as theſe.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. <hi>The true knowledge of God doth make a man effectually purge himſelf from all filthy and noiſome luſts.</hi> To ſay we know God and yet give our ſelves to ſin, is a lye, and it argueth no truth in us, 1· <hi>John</hi> 3.6. <hi>He that commits ſin hath not known or ſeen God,</hi> which is the reaſon why the Prophets attribute all the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſſe in a Land to the not knowing of God: So our Saviour tels the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees, that all their wickedneſſe was becauſe they did not know him and his Father; and in this Chapter Chriſt ſaith, <hi>The world hath not known thee, but theſe have known thee.</hi> Epheſ. 4. <hi>If ye have been taught as the truth is in Jeſus</hi>;
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:65216:59"/>
and <hi>ye have not ſo learned Chriſt.</hi> What is this? when we have ſo learned Chriſt, as to put off the old man with the luſts thereof. Never then boaſt of thy knowledge and thy parts, what mortification of ſinne, what cleanſing from thy filth doth it cauſe in thee; if thy Chriſtian knowledge doth not work a Chriſtian life, but thou art bruitiſh and diſſolute in thy life, tremble at thy eſtate, for thou art out of the way to heaven, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.20. ſome are ſaid to have <hi>eſcaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of God,</hi> yet theſe did it externally only. They were ſwine though waſhed, not ſheep, but thou doſt not come thus farre; though thou haſt the knowledge of God, yet thou walloweſt in thy mire, and lickeſt up thy vomit: Thy condemnation will be the greater, becauſe thou knoweſt thy Maſters will and doſt it not. What ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence then ſhall we paſſe upon all the carnall and wicked waies of moſt men, they know well enough, they underſtand well enough, but becauſe this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge hath no efficacy upon their lives, therefore they go in the broad way to hell.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. <hi>Saving knowledge, as it cauſeth an avoiding of ſinne, ſo a ready and willing obedience unto the commands of God.</hi> And for this ſake all diſobedient and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious ſinners, are ſaid in the Scripture not to know God: They are excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently put together, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.8. <hi>in flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, nor obey the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> What obedience then and conformity to Gods Law doth thy knowledge work in thee? this God looketh at, he careth not for thy head or thy tongue, if he have not thy heart, thy hands, and thy whole life. If ſo be the Apoſtle ſay, that he which doubteth whether ſuch a thing be ſinne, he is damned if he do it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. how damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is that mans condition, who knoweth and is aſſured that he ſinneth, and yet wilfully perſiſts in it! So that our knowledge is not to be carried only to truths, to what is to be beleeved, and there to ſit down, No, but <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.2. we are to be <hi>transformed</hi> in our minde, that we may <hi>prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God:</hi> We are to conſider what is that which is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable and well-pleaſing to God, and when we know it we muſt readily full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill it: Oh that men of knowledge and parts would think of theſe things; Doſt thou that which is well-pleaſing to God? Doth God accept of ſuch a life as thine? Is there not a plain contrariety and oppoſition between Gods will and thy luſts? A man of great knowledge, and alſo great impiety, were he not puffed up with ſelf-flattery, would eaſily ſee the oppoſition between his life and Gods Word, the one is ſtrict, his life is diſſolute; the one calleth to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void not only ſinne but the appearance of it, but thy life plungeth thee both into ſinne, and the occaſions of it: Oh conſider all thy knowledge and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding helps thee no more then the devils knowledge doth them, they are not able to love or delight in God and his will.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. <hi>The knowledge of God will make a man keep a good conſcience in all things:</hi> it will make him take heed of ſinne in ſecret, as well as publique; it will make him do duties in ſecret, as well as openly, for whoſoever is not afraid to ſinne in ſecret, whoſoever neglects private duties and holineſſe, this man knoweth not God, he doth not underſtand that he is omnipreſent, that his eye is every where beholding all things, that darkneſſe and light are all one to him: Oh this is a precious and neceſſary effect of the knowledge of God, when it makes a man cry out with <hi>Joſeph,</hi> though in the moſt ſecret temptation, <hi>How can I do this and ſinne againſt God,</hi> Gen. 39.21. Thoſe wicked men incouraged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in their wickedneſſe by this, <hi>Doth the Lord ſee, and is there knowledge in the moſt high?</hi> Pſal. 73.11. And on the contrary, he that truly knoweth God dareth not be wanton, unjuſt, diſhoneſt, becauſe the eye of God is upon him whereſoever he is. <hi>David</hi> is much affected with this omnipotence and omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.2, 4. <hi>Thou knoweſt my downſitting, and upriſing,</hi> yea

every thought thou knoweſt afarre off. How could there be ſuch works of darkneſſe, ſuch ſinnes committed in ſecret that are not fit to be named, but becauſe men do not know God in a right and true manner. By this we ſee there is little true knowledge of God in moſt towns, moſt families, becauſe men live not, as ſenſible of the juſt and revengefull eye of God beholding them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies.</p>

            <p>WE have finiſhed that duty which is ſaid to be the Means to Eternall Life; We come to the Object, which is twofold:</p>
            <p n="1">1. The true God, and thus Heathens and Pagans are excluded.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Chriſt Jeſus, and thus the Jews, who though they know the true God, yet becauſe they deny Chriſt, are out of the way to heaven; and ſo ſome Heretiques alſo, who deny Chriſt to be our Mediator.</p>

Though there are Sunne and Starres, yet as made Gods, ſo there is no ſuch thing: Though there were ſuch men as <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter,</hi> yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latively as Idols repreſenting a God, they were a <hi>non-entity.</hi> He brings this verſe in by way of accuſation to anſwer the objection: There are, ſaith he, <gap reason="foreign">

            <p n="3">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. <hi>There is the book of Gods Word</hi>; and by this we have a <hi>revealed knowledge,</hi> and this only doth direct in the true way to ſerve him acceptably. Therefore all the world is ſaid <hi>to lie in darkneſſe,</hi> and light comes only by the Scripture. This is the great mercy of God to manifeſt from heaven what he is, and how he will be worſhipped.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Conſider that our knowledge even at the higheſt is very imperfect</hi>;<note place="margin">III. Our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God is very imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</note> it's but apprehenſive, not comprehenſive, which made an ancient ſay, <hi>De Deo etiam vera dicere periculoſum eſt,</hi> becauſe we are ſubject to ſuch ignorance and blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, God himſelf doth only comprehend himſelf; we know him obſcurely, and therefore he is ſaid to <hi>dwell in light inacceſſible,</hi> 1 Tim. 6.16. As the eye cannot penetrate into the glorious nature of the Sunne, no more can we ſearch into the deep things of God. Therefore Divines ſay we have a twofold way of knowing God, the one is <hi>affirmative</hi> and <hi>poſitive,</hi> when thoſe perfections we ſee in creatures we attribute to God in a ſupereminent manner: Thus we ſay he is <hi>wiſe,</hi> he is <hi>juſt,</hi> he <hi>knoweth,</hi> he <hi>willeth,</hi> but <hi>after a more tranſcendent way of perfection then man doth.</hi> The ſecond way is by <hi>negation,</hi> or removing imperfections from him, and this indeed is commended as a better way then the former: We can more eaſily deſcribe God, by ſaying <hi>what he is not,</hi> then <hi>what he is</hi>; he is not a body, and when we ſay a Spirit, then we runne to a negative again, not a finite limited Spirit. In this life every mans knowledge is imperfect, <hi>we know but in part, Paul</hi> ſaid ſo, that was wrapped up into the third heavens, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. And although in heaven our knowledge ſhall be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, deſcribed by that expreſſion, <hi>We ſhall ſee him face to face,</hi> yet even then it cannot be comprehenſive of the whole nature of God, there being no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion between a finite faculty and an infinite object.</p>
            <p>In the fourth place, take notice that this expreſſion, <hi>the true God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">IV.</note> may be taken in a twofold ſenſe, as truth is divided into <hi>veritas rei,</hi> and <hi>veritas con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptus,</hi> the truth of the thing, and the truth of conceiving of it: Now the Heathens when they worſhipped <hi>Jupiter</hi> as the chiefeſt and higheſt God, there was the truth of the thing, there was a ſupream and a chief that they intended, but there was no truth in their conceptions and apprehenſions about him; therefore they added many other gods to him: Such a diſtinction as this the Apoſtle inſinuates, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.23. where reproving them for their Idolatry, and telling them of an Altar with this inſcription, <hi>To the unknown God, whom</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>you ignorantly worſhip, we declare to you.</hi> It was a true God they worſhipped when they conceived of one ſupream above the reſt, but they had no true or right thoughts about him. Hence what the Poet ſaid of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> the Apoſtle owneth as of the true God, <hi>for we are his offspring,</hi> Acts 17.28. Now their thoughts were Idolatricall about the true God, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. <hi>turning
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:65216:62"/>
his Image into the ſimilitude of creatures</hi>; and then they ſuperadded other Gods, which made <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſay, <hi>Deus non erit Deus, niſi homini placuerit.</hi> The ſumme of this particular is no more, then that even in their Polytheiſm and multiplied Idolatry that the Heathens lived in, there was a generall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed aſſent that there was a God; ſo that although there was no truth at all in their apprehenſions, yet ſomething there was in the object ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally conſidered, but not as it was particularly terminated upon any one thing.</p>

The <hi>Platoes,</hi> the <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> of the world, were like the <hi>Sodomites</hi> groping in the dark, that could not feel what they ſought for, but the Word of God, that is wonderfully commended for the clearneſſe and brightneſſe of the light it brings with it.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 4. <hi>It faileth in reſpect of the efficacy:</hi> All that knowledge they had did not ſerve to purifie their lives, to cleanſe them from their wickedneſſe, but they <hi>detained the truth in unrighteouſneſſe,</hi> Rom. 1. And if you ſay many Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians that have great revealed knowledge are not yet cleanſed from their impieties; There is as much prophanneſſe, yea ſometimes more then have been in Heathens: Some Heathens would loſe all they had rather then <hi>ſwear,</hi> they did ſo fear <hi>an oath. Baſil</hi> upbraideth Chriſtians with this. Of another Heathen it was ſaid, You may ſooner put the Sunne out of its courſe, then make him do what is unjuſt: As alſo of <hi>Cato,</hi> either drunkenneſſe was not a ſinne, or <hi>Cato</hi> was not drunk: but are there not thouſands of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and that with much knowledge, great underſtanding in the Scripture and Religion, yet runne into all this exceſſive wickedneſſe? It's true, and <hi>wo be to thoſe that make it true</hi>; but then you muſt remember, that there is a meer barren brain knowledge, and a gracious practicall knowledge: Now where this later is, there is alwaies a clean and pure life; as for the other, it's not ſo much a knowledge, as a profeſſion of it; <hi>They profeſſe they know God, but in works they deny him,</hi> Tit. 1.16. therefore the Scripture complaineth of ſuch as not knowing God, <hi>The Ox knoweth his owner, and the Aſſe his maſters crib, but Iſrael hath not known me ſaith God,</hi> Iſa. 1.6. We might adde more things, but I ſhall ſpend the other part by way of Uſe in practicall corollaries of great uſe in our lives.</p>

Now this Idolatry is of two ſorts, either firſt, <hi>When we ſet up a falſe God for the true</hi>; ſo did all the Heathens, when they <hi>worſhipped the hoſt of heaven,</hi> or their other conſtituted Gods. Or ſecondly, <hi>When the true God is worſhipped, but after a falſe and unlawfull manner.</hi> The firſt Commandment forbids the former Idolatry; the ſecond, the later. God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad the Iſraelites to worſhip him under any repreſentation whatſoever, ſo that though it were the true God they worſhipped, yet if not after the ſame manner he commanded, this was idolatry.

man doth his luſts; ſo that whatſoever a mans heart doth inordinately runne out upon, that creature he loveth more then God, this makes him an Idolater: As he ſaid of <hi>Baal, Why halt ye between two, If God be God ſerve him? If Baal be God ſerve him?</hi> So we may ſay, Why halt ye between God and the creature? If God be the only true God, let him have the only true love and joy of thy ſoul? If riches and luſts be God, then let them have all thy heart.</p>
            <p>As there is practicall Idolatry, ſo there is doctrinall Idolatry, <hi>viz. When we attribute that to our own power or free will which belongs only to God.</hi> Thus all thoſe proud and arrogant opinions which advance <hi>free-will,</hi> make it able to work with God in converſion, this is to derogate from God, he ſhall not then be the God from whom every good and perfect gift doth proceed. The Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.2. ſaith, <hi>To us there is but one God, the Father, from whom are all things, and to him are all things,</hi> ſo that God is there made the firſt cauſe of all the good things we have, and the ultimate end to which we do referre all. Certainly if it be a forſaking of God to ſet up any Authors for temporall mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and temporall ſalvations, then much more for ſpirituall; for which is greater, the work of nature or the work of grace? Therefore let us walk hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and becauſe he is the onely true God, from whom are all things, and to whom, let us ſay, Not to our own power, but thy grace, be all glory given.</p>

               <hi>Then how great and hainous a ſinne is it to have any communion or commerce with the devil or his inſtruments,</hi> and yet this is a ſin too commonly practiſed. If men have loſt any thing, if they be in any pain or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe, then they preſently run to ſuch as they call wiſe men, though they be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the devils fools: What is this but to renounce God and to renounce your baptiſme? If you have loſt your goods, you will go and loſe your ſouls to: We reade of <hi>Ahaziah,</hi> 2 King. 1.6. when his childe was ſick, he would go to <hi>Baal,</hi> to know whether his childe ſhould recover or no; but with what a dreadfull meſſage doth Gods Prophet entertain him, telling him, his childe ſhould die, withall ſaying, <hi>Is it becauſe there is not a God in Iſrael</hi> that thou doeſt ſo? May not we ſay ſo, when you go to the devils inſtruments, witches, wiſe men and ſorcerers, Is it becauſe there is not a true God in heaven? Some have queſtioned whether ſuch as compact with the devil, and uſe familiar ſpirits can poſſibly repent and be ſaved, they doubt whether they are in a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of ever having eternall life; but that is too rigid, for we reade of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſes,</hi> a great ſinner in this kinde, one that was given to witchcraft, and uſed a familiar ſpirit, yet he prayed and humbled himſelf, and God accepted of him: So we reade of ſome converted by the Apoſtles preaching, that brought in all their conjuring books and burnt them, <hi>Act.</hi> 19.19. Though therefore no doubt is to be made but upon their repentance God will forgive, yet it is a great and a grievous ſinne, it's a renouncing of God and your Baptiſm. Take heed then of ever doing ſo, and if thy heart hath been ſo graceleſſe and wicked heretofore, oh abhorre thy ſelf, let thy conſcience cry out, I have committed a great and abominable ſinne, thou art the chiefeſt ſinner of many thouſands. We ought to have no communion with the devil, though he had power to foretell and ſo do good to thee, as he hath not any further then God may reveal to him. When the devils confeſſed Chriſt was the true Son of God, he rebuked them, and would not own ſuch a confeſſion: So <hi>Paul</hi> alſo, <hi>Act.</hi> 16.16. would not own a confeſſion though true, becauſe by one poſſeſſed by the devil.

            </epigraph>
            <p>WE now come to the ſecond Object of this knowledge neceſſary to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and that is Chriſt. This latter Object is added becauſe of the Jews, and ſome Heretiques, who though they acknowledge the only true God, yet becauſe they are eirher ignorant of, or deny Chriſt, therefore they are not in the way to ſalvation; The object to be known is deſcribed,
<list>
                  <item>1. By his proper Name.</item>
                  <item>2. By his appellative or name of office.</item>
                  <item>3. From the Original and Cauſe of it.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>His proper name is <hi>Jeſus,</hi> Though ſome learned men have affected to go out of the ordinary way in giving the true root of this word, yet certainly the moſt common derivation of it is moſt true, <hi>viz.</hi> that it comes from the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> to <hi>ſave,</hi> as the Angell plainly interprets it, his Name ſhall be called <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> becauſe he ſhall ſave his people from their ſinnes, <hi>Mat.</hi> 1.21. It's the ſame with <hi>Joſhua,</hi> who was ſo called, becauſe he delivered the people out of their temporal miſeries, and brought them into <hi>Canaan,</hi> being herein a Type of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. His Name of office <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as much as <hi>anointed,</hi> I ſhall not ſay much of this word now, Though the word be attributed to others, yet Jeſus is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly called the Meſſias, he is the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nctus unctorum,</hi> the anointed of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed, and this doth eſpecially demonſtrate the Prieſtly and the Kingly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Chriſt,</p>
            <p n="3">3. There is the Original or Fountain of this office, It's <hi>from God the Father,</hi> Now when the Father is ſaid to ſend him, it is not to be underſtood as if it were againſt Chriſts will, no, but he voluntarily and readily undertook this Office likewiſe, ſo that if we did know and acknowledge ſuch a perſon as was called Jeſus, yet if we did not alſo acknowledge him to be the Chriſt, the Mediatour appointed by God, our knowledge would be inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient.</p>

                  <hi>Obſerv.</hi> The know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the true God is not enough to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation without the knowledge of Chriſt.</note>Obſ. <hi>That the knowledge of one true God is not enough to ſalvatian, without the knowledge of Chriſt alſo</hi>; They are both put together, and none may ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate them: Hence it's ſo often in Scripture commanded that we ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve in Chriſt, That be who beleeveth ſhall not enter into judgement, and our Saviour makes the knowlege of him and the Father inſeparably joyned together, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8.19.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:65216:64"/>To open the Doctrine Conſider,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> 1. That we cannot have any knowledge about Chriſt, either that there is ſuch an one, or what he is, but only by Revelation; We told you about God, there was a threefold Knowledge, by nature, by the Creatures, by the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures; And therefore whereas it might be, and is eaſily granted by all, that none can be ſaved without the knowledge of the true God, yet both of old and of late, there have been thoſe who have held that the Nations that know not Chriſt, may be ſaved: It's true, they are divided among themſelves, for ſome ſay, the Gentiles have ſome implied or confuſed knowledge of Chriſt, or elſe God revealeth it to them extraordinarily, but others poſitively ſay, the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge we have by nature and meer light of reaſon is enough to conduct to heaven: As for <hi>Cornelius</hi> the Centurion whom they inſtance in, the firſt Heathen converted and baptized under the New Teſtament, it is plain that he had a knowledge of Chriſt, though imperfect; Neither is that expreſſion of <hi>Peter</hi> upon <hi>Cornelius</hi> his admiſſion, <hi>Act.</hi> 10.35. where he ſaith, God is no accepter of perſons, but in every Nation he that feareth him and worketh righteouſneſſe ſhall be ſaved, any waies favouring ſalvation without Chriſt; For now the partition wall being broken down, and the Goſpel to be prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched to all Nations, which was repreſented in the viſion of a ſheet full of clean and unclean beaſts, the Knowledge of Chriſt was likewiſe therewith to be propagated: It's true the Apoſtle ſaith, they that ſinne without the Law ſhall be judged without the Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. God will not judge them by that they knew not, and ſo they that ſinne without the knowledge of the Goſpel, they ſhall not be judged for not beleeving in Chriſt, and not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of him to whom he was never tendred, but then they have a law of conſcience within them, by which they ſhall be condemned, ſo that by the Scripture we cannot ſay there is any other way of ſalvation but by the Name of Chriſt, and Faith in his Name, yea, that Text <hi>Act.</hi> 4.12. is plainly excluding any other way of ſalvation, <hi>There is no other Name under Heaven whereby we muſt be ſaved</hi>; Howſoever men may tropically explain and ſay, how can we think ſo merciful a God can ſuffer ſo many thouſands and thouſands who never heard of Chriſt to periſh? yea, their poor Infants, who committed no actual ſinne; We muſt ſubmit to the Scripture, otherwiſe we may take up <hi>Origens</hi> opinion, and ſay, how doth it ſtand with the goodneſſe of God and his pity to let ſo many Angels and men be damned, and not ſave them all at laſt; But when the Word of God ſpeaks man muſt be ſilent and hold his tongue.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> 2. A right knowledge about one true God is not enough without the knowledge of Chriſt, partly on Gods part, and partly on our part; On Gods part, for ſo he is abſolutely conſidered as a righteous and juſt God,<note place="margin">The Reaſons of the Point.</note> hating all ſinne, and puniſhing it where he findes it; Now in this conſideration he is a conſuming fire, there is a great gulf between him and us; The devils and damned in hell may as well hope for mercy as we, if there were no Chriſt; The heathens therefore who hoped for pardon they ignorantly thought to ſatisfie God, as if he could be ſatisfied by any finite thing, as <hi>Luther</hi> ſaid, It's not <hi>Deus abſolutus</hi> but <hi>relativus,</hi> not God conſidered abſolutely but relative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as a Father in Covenant, through Chriſt that is the ground of all our hope and comfort; This knowledge would only terrifie and drive to deſpair, as you ſee in <hi>Adam</hi> till he was comforted with the promiſe. 2. On our part, It's neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to know Chriſt as well as God, becauſe without Chriſt there is no founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for any duty; We cannot pray, we cannot approach near to him; As he is a conſuming fire, ſo we are combuſtible ſtubble, <hi>Whatſoever ye ſhall ask in my Name,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>ſhall be given you</hi>; It muſt be through that Name our duties are accepted: Can two walk together unleſſe they be agreed? What
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:65216:65"/>
concord or agreement can there be between a righteous God and a corrupted ſinner? For this cauſe it is that the moſt holy men have praied that God would not enter into ſtrict judgement with them, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 143.2, If men ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied dare not appear at the Tribunal of God in their own perſons, much leſſe may ſinners; It's neceſſary then becauſe of that contrariety between God and ſinful man, there ſhould be a Mediatour, an advocate, one that ſhould ſtand between juſtice and us, the condemning power of the Law and us; Who is not afraid of juſtice? Who hath ſo much purity that the Law cannot finde any fault with him? So that if we conſider of theſe two particulars we ſhall ſee great reaſon that we have to know Chriſt and God alſo.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> Thirdly, Take notice, <hi>That a Knowledge or belief that there is a Meſſias, is not enough, unleſſe we beleeve that perſon called Ieſus, to be Chriſt</hi>; For he doth not ſay, This is Eternal Life to beleeve a Chriſt, but that Jeſus is Chriſt; The Jews to this day beleeve there will be a Meſſias, all their hope and expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is for ſuch an one, but yet the Apoſtle ſaith, they are caſt off by God for the preſent, that they are branches broken off from the Olive, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. and why? becauſe they erre in two particulars: 1. They deny that Jeſus born of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> to be the Meſſiah, Therefore they will not beleeve the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to be fullfilled in him. And 2. They look for a temporall Meſſiah, who ſhall reſtore them from bodily captivity, not for a Saviour in a ſpiritual ſence. Indeed before Chriſt came into the fleſh, then a belief and expectation of a Meſſiah was enough, as appears by <hi>Simeons</hi> Song, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.34. who was one of the expectants for Chriſt, and when he ſaw him then deſired to depart in peace, but now ſince he is come, it's neceſſary to ſalvation to beleeve that Perſon born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and crucified by the Jews under <hi>Pilate,</hi> was the true and promiſed Meſſias, Therefore a great part of the Apoſtles Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry was to prove that Jeſus was the Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/> Fourthly, In that Chriſt makes Eternall Life to lie in theſe two neceſſary things, therefore <hi>the Papists are horribly preſumptuous,</hi> who adde a third thing neceſſary to Eternal Life, which is <hi>Subeſſe Romano Pontifici, To acknowledge the Pope to be head of the Church, and to ſubmit to him,</hi> This is <hi>de neceſſitate ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutis</hi> ſaith <hi>Bellarmine.</hi> But they have never yet been able to make this out that there is ſuch an univerſal viſible and infallible head of the Church: Yea, <hi>Gregory</hi> one of the Popes ſaid, <hi>Whoſoever ſhould arrogate to himſelf the Title of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Biſhop, he was the Forerunner of Antichrist</hi>; For the great Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtianiſm deſcribed by the Apoſtles, lieth not ſo much in doctrines; Though they be Antichriſts alſo that deny Chriſt to be come in the fleſh, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.16. yet the great Antichriſt is deſcribed by the Church-power, and univerſal do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion; he ſhall take to himſelf in the Church, exalting himſelf above every thing that is called God, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.4. Therefore howſoever they pronounce ſuch dreadful ſentences upon all the Reformed Churches, that have caſt off the Popes power, as if they were not in a way to Eternal Life, yet this Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture may abundantly encourage, where there is a true knowledge of God and Chriſt, there is a poſſibility of Eternal Life.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/> Fifthly, To know Jeſus Chriſt whom the Father hath ſent implieth the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of theſe particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That he is really and truly God,</hi> for how can he be a ſpiritual Saviour if he be not God? Is it not God only that can <hi>raiſe from the dead</hi>? Could meer man ſatisfie the juſtice of God, deſtroy the works of the devil? It's not my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe here to confirm that main Article of Religion, I only inform you that he who truly knoweth Chriſt muſt know him to be God the only begotten of the Father, elſe he cannot know him as a Jeſus, as a Saviour; Therefore howſoever <hi>Arians</hi> and <hi>Socinians</hi> talk much of Chriſt, diſpute much of him, yea, mention him in their praiers and Petitions, yet they do not truly know
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:65216:65"/>
Chriſt, if the Apoſtle makes it ſo great a ſinne to deny Chriſt to be come in the fleſh, to be man, that he ſaith, he is Antichriſt that doth ſo, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.18. then it muſt needs be a greater ſinne to deny him to be God, for as he doth a man a greater wrong that denieth him a rationall ſoul, then that denieth a mortal body to him, ſo he doth in a greater manner diſhonour Chriſt that denieth him to be God then to be man: Shall Chriſt himſelf <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. think it no robbery to be equal with God, and will they make Chriſt guilty of ſuch robbery? for he aſſumed to himſelf both the Title and reality of God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To know Jeſus Chriſt is to acknowledge him man as well as God, for this was his name given him by the Angel, when he was born, ſo that he on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knoweth Chriſt who acknowledgeth him both God and man, as the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture ſometimes cals him the only begotten Son of God, ſo ſometimes the Son of man, and many places in Scripture ſpeak of both his natures, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.5. who concerning the fleſh, <hi>was of the Seed of Abraham,</hi> and yet he is <hi>God for evermore,</hi> concerning the fleſh, that is ſpoken oppoſitely to his divine nature, ſo that to deny the humane nature of Chriſt, though we ſhould affirm he was God, yet this is not to know Chriſt, Therefore the Marcioniſts and ſome A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptiſts who ſaid he had not a true reall body, that he was only in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of a man, They do not know Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>To know Jeſus Chriſt implieth alſo that we have ſome underſtanding of his Offices</hi>; Of his anointing with all ſufficiency and fulneſſe, to be a Mediatour for us; He that ſaith he knows Chriſt, and doth not acknowledge him anointed by God, with all fulneſſe to be a Mediatour for us, ſaith, he knoweth not what; Now the ignorance of Chriſts Office, and his fulneſſe therein doth wonderfully abound in Popery; The devil in former times oppoſed the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of Chriſt, when he could no longer ſucceed that way, then he oppoſeth the Offices of Chriſt, all thoſe doctrines of merits, indulgencies, and ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions do oppoſe the Offices of Chriſt, for if Chriſt be the Meſſiah, if he be the full Mediatour, to what purpoſe are all theſe? Although therefore in Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery there is the true doctrine retained about Chriſts Natures, he is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to be God and man, yet in reſpect of his Offices there is a total bury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him in ſilence: Angels and Saints merits and indulgencies have even almoſt put out the very Name of Chriſt amongſt them, ſo then all acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging that Chriſt is not enough, it muſt be a Scripture-confeſſing of him; We muſt give him his full due, not make him half a Mediatour, half a Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and joyn' our ſelves or others in this great work.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>To know Chriſt implieth alſo that we acknowledge the great love of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in ſending his only Son thus to mediate for us:</hi> Therefore it's added, <hi>whom thou haſt ſent,</hi> and for this reaſon it's ſaid, he <hi>that knoweth and honoureth the Son, muſt know and honour the Father alſo,</hi> Joh. 5.23. For from the Father comes the Spring of all this love, <hi>He ſo loved the world that he gave his only Son,</hi> Joh. 3. and certainly this is of great conſequence to know the Father ſent Chriſt into the world, for hereby we may be aſſured that all the obedience and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of Chriſt ſhall be accepted of by the Father; We need not fear it or doubt of it, for the Father did make the firſt motion as it were to the Sonne, Though the Sonne alſo did readily and voluntarily undertake it; Now how great a matter was this, for God the Father to do? Was not Chriſt the only begotten and beloved of the Father? Did he not come out of his Fathers bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to the Croſſe, and ſhall not this make us return all thankfulneſſe and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience unto him.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, <hi>This muſt neceſſarily imply a knowledge of our miſery and damnable condition by ſinne:</hi> For if we were not loſt what need had we of a Saviour? If we were not ſinners what need of a Mediatour? So that the acknowledging
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:65216:66"/>
of a Chriſt ſent into the world to be a Mediatour is the beleeving alſo of man by nature to be the childe of wrath, the Enemy of God, one who may not come into his preſence, or expect the leaſt hope of mercy, till an Advocate and Interceſſour come and pleade his cauſe, ſo that this Knowledge of a Chriſt ſhould be accompanied with great affections and workings of heart, it ſhould breed ſhame, fear, and confuſion in us, it ſhould breed an hungring and thirſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after Chriſt, an eſteem of him as the only Remedy; In Chriſt only is our fulneſſe, our ſins would undo us, were it not for his righteouſneſſe, our iniquities would overthrow us; Did not be intercede, bleſſed art thou then when this Knowledge is like fire in thy boſome, kindling holy flames within thee: Now here may be ſome Queſtions made:</p>

               </note>But to anſwer this: 1. No doubt but the common and ordinary ſort of them was greatly ignorant of Chriſt, and therefore reſted in their Sacrifices, and the knowledge of the Law, as the only thing that made them accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; This is plain by the Apoſtles Arguments in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> and we ſee by the Prophets they ſo relied upon theſe externall ſervices, that they thought themſelves beloved of God, though abounding in all wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: And no wonder they did ſo, for under the Goſpel how many reſt on their duties, and have no faith in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>But 2. Thoſe that were holy and godly, <hi>they looked upon all their bodily Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices as Types of Chriſt</hi>; It was Chriſts bloud they put confidence in; The Apoſtle in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> ſhews, that God intended Chriſt by thoſe Sacrifices, and that the bloud of Rams and Goats could never clenſe away ſinne, as this was Gods meaning, ſo the Prieſts and Prophets they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained the meaning thereof to the people, and ſometimes they have clear promiſes of a Saviour, a Meſſias to come to them, who ſhall be a Prince of Peace, and ſhall bear their ſinnes for them, as <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſpeaks like an Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt to this purpoſe, which made the Apoſtle ſay that the Prophets did bear witneſſe of Chriſt; <hi>Abraham he ſaw Chriſts day and rejoyced,</hi> Act. 10.43. Now all the godly have the ſame faith <hi>Abraham</hi> had, therefore he is made the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Faithfull,</hi> ſo that what was covered in the Old Teſtament is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in the New; Chriſt they had, and Mediation they had, though the Knowledge of it was more obſcure: Hence the Goſpel is ſaid to riſe like the Light of the Sun.</p>

               </note>2. <hi>It may be demanded, why the Knowledge of the holy Ghoſt is not there ſaid to be Eternal Life,</hi> as well as of the Father and the Son, for without the Spirit of God efficiently enabling us, we cannot do any holy duty as well as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Chriſts merits, we cannot be accepted: Chriſt is the meritorious cauſe, and the Spirit of God the applying cauſe.</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi>
               </note>To this we may ſay, that the Knowledge of the Spirit is neceſſarily implied in the Knowledge of Chriſt; For he was in reſpect of his humane nature con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the holy Ghoſt, when he was to leave his Apoſtles bodily, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth his Spirit to ſupply his preſence, So that none can know Chriſt as a Mediatour, that doth not alſo know the holy Ghoſt: Hence be is called, the Spirit of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>And in the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> place we may ſay it's not neceſſary that this Text ſhould ſpeak of all things neceſſary to Salvation, It's enough that other places doe ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:65216:66"/>
teſtifie it; Now that the knowledge of the holy Ghoſt is alſo requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to Eternal Life appeareth, in that we are baptized into his Name, ſo that it's a principle and Foundation to be inſtructed about the holy Ghoſt, as well as the Father and the Sonne. We reade that the Apoſtle doth in moſt of his Salutations pray for grace and peace from God the Father and the Lod Jeſus Chriſt, yet none may from thence gather the Spirit is excluded, for 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.13, 14. There is <hi>the communion of the Spirit</hi> added to <hi>the love of God and the grace of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. You may demand, <hi>If the Knowledge of thoſe things be enough to eternall Life, what then needs the Miniſtry or Preaching to a man that knoweth theſe</hi>: If a man have theſe, is he not above Ordinances and the Miniſtry; This indeed ſome have arrogantly thought.</p>
            <p>But 1. There is no man knoweth as much about God and Chriſt as may be known; The Apoſtle that was lifted up to the third heavens, yet he ſaith, <hi>We know but in part,</hi> 1 Cor. 13. If <hi>Paul</hi> then knew but in part, what muſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers do? We ſee the Angels themſelves deſire to have the Myſtery of Chriſt made more known to them, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. ſo that it's a fooliſh conceit to think thou knoweſt enough already, for though our knowledge ſhall be perfected in heaven, yet even there we cannot know God as much as he is known, for the infinite object cannot be comprehended by a finite faculty.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Suppoſe thou couldſt not grow in knowledge, which yet is impoſſible, yet the Miniſtry is neceſſary for thy heart and affections; The devils know more then any man, but there will is obdurate and hardened in wickedneſſe; So thou maiſt have great knowledge and underſtanding, yet thy heart may need much quickening, much mollifying, and for this end the Miniſtry is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed.</p>
            <p n="3">3, If thou didſt not finde a need of them either for underſtanding or heart, which yet is more impoſſible then the former; yet God having appointed ſuch a way, thou art only for obedience ſake, and to teſtifie thy ſubmiſſion to God to do it; Chriſt needed not to be baptized, for he wanted not the grace ſignified, <hi>viz.</hi> remiſſion of ſinnes: Yet to ſhew his obedience he did it, <hi>Adam</hi> though created in a ſtate of integrity, yet had a command of triall, to manifeſt his obedience, and ſo though never ſo perfect, yet thou canſt not be exempted from obedience to Gods commands.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>IN this Verſe our Saviour addeth a new argument for that Petition menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on mentioned <hi>v.</hi> 1. <hi>Glorifie me.</hi> Why? becauſe <hi>I have glorified thee on earth, I have finiſhed my work</hi>: Now his work is done, he expects his reward; Theſe words our Saviour doth not ſpeak out of oſtentation and boaſting, but to ſhew the order God appointed, that by his ſufferings when perfected he ſhould enter into glory.</p>
            <p>In the words we have Chriſts profeſſion of the end he intended in all things, <hi>I have glorified thee on earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The manner how, or the means by which, <hi>I have finiſhed the work thou gaveſt me to do.</hi> I have glorified thee, though Chriſt as God had all divine glory due to him, yet as Mediatour in the ſtate of humiliation, ſo he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour to the Father, and in this ſence he did glorifie him.</p>
            <p>To glorifie is either when really that glory is exhibited, which was not before, and ſo God glorifieth us, or elſe when we celebrate, acknowledge, and declare that glory which is already poſſeſſed, and thus we glorifie God; For when we glorifie God, we adde nothing to him, we do not make him more glorious then he is indeed, We cannot advantage him but our ſelves by ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of him, as a man by ſeeing doth not profit the Sun but himſelf, nor the thirſty Traveller by drinking refreſh the Fountain but himſelf; Chriſt then being by the ſtate of humiliation made lower then God, yea, lower then Angels, had this purity of intention in all that he did and all that he ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to glorifie God.</p>

               <hi>Q.</hi> If you ſay, Was not the redemption and ſalvation of theſe the Father gave him his end, how then is the glory of God his end?</p>

               </note>
               <hi>A.</hi> The Anſwer is, the ultimate and chief end is Gods glory, The proxime and immediate was the ſalvation of man, and therefore in reſpect of the chief end this is the manner or the means of glorifying of God, and this is intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed when he ſaith, <hi>He had finiſhed his work.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Conſider the reſtriction or limitation of this glorifying of God, from the place where, <hi>I have glorified thee on earth</hi>: That is mentioned, becauſe here
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:65216:67"/>
only on the earth was he to be in a ſtate of debaſement, here only he was to work, in heaven he was to receive his glory; The Schoolmen uſe to call a man while he was in this life the way to heaven, <hi>viator,</hi> and when he is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of glory, they call him <hi>comprehenſor</hi>: Now they ſay, That Chriſt was both <hi>viator</hi> and <hi>comprehenſor</hi> together, but if they mean, that in this life he poſſeſſed all that glory which he ſhould have in heaven, that is falſe, for we ſee him here praying for it, and other places God promiſeth it as a reward of his obedience and ſufferings: Indeed the humane nature of Chriſt was alwaies united perſonally to the godhead, but there was a ſuſpenſion of that glorious influance and happineſſe while on the earth.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Conſider the time when Chriſt makes this profeſſion, at the end of his daies, when he is to go out of this world; This was the ground of his confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in his Petition; Now although we are not able in the ſame degree and perfection to ſay as he did, yet for the main we ought to be like him in this, when Death comes, when our daies are to be finiſhed, to be able to ſay, Lord, we have glorified thee, we have finiſhed the work thou gaveſt us to do, and of this particular I ſhall treat.</p>
            <p>Obſ.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Doct.</hi> It's a bleſſed thing at death truly to ſay, Lord, I have glorified thee.</note> 
               <hi>That it is a bleſſed and moſt happy thing to be able at the time of death truly to ſay, Lord, I have glorified thee in my life, I have finiſhed all the work I was to do.</hi> This Subject will be very profitable and neceſſary, you cannot expect health and life alwaies in this world, your time is running, your daies are decaying, you are haſting to the grave, who knoweth how ſoon God will put a period to thy life in this world? What then ſhould be more in your hearts and thoughts then this, Whether have I lived to Gods glory? whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have I faithfully diſcharged the work put upon me? It's not riches, wealth, greatneſſe, or any earthly advantages will then do you good; This or nothing will then be a reviving to you; We have two pregnant examples for this, 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 20.3. When that ſad meſſage was brought to <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> that he muſt <hi>ſet his houſe in order, for he muſt die and not live</hi>; What is a comfort and a cordial to him under this bitter news, <hi>Remember O Lord that I have walked before thee With an upright heart, and done what was good in thy ſight; Hezekiah</hi> had great outward proſperity, he had many earthly delights as a King, but ſee how eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry earthly comfort vaniſheth away, That he had ſerved God in the upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his heart comforted him more then all earthly honour or greatneſſe. The other Inſtance is in <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 Tim. 4.7. <hi>I have fought a good fight, I have fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed my courſe, a Crown of glory is laid up for me</hi>; If all the glory of the world had been given <hi>Paul,</hi> would it have comforted him like this Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of a godly converſation? Oh how many dying men may ſay, I have ſerved the devil, I have fullfilled his luſts, and now I goe to my everlaſting torments.</p>
            <p>To quicken and affect you in this Point take notice of theſe Introductory particulars.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>That there is a day of Judgement when God will call every man to account</hi>;<note place="margin">Conſider</note> We are not to live here as we liſt, and to do all things without controul; No,<note place="margin">I. There is a day of judgement when God will call every man to account.</note> God hath appointed a time when every man ſhall appear before him, and he muſt give an account of all his time, all his Talents, all his actions, all his thoughts, of all things in this world that have been his; The Scripture is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry clear in this formidable Truth, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. <hi>We muſt all appear before the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Seat of Chriſt to give an account for what hath been done in the fleſh,</hi> Mat. 12.36. yea, of every idle word we muſt give an account, yea, of every <hi>ſecret</hi> thing, Eccl. 12.16. The Parable of the Talents <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.15. where the man with ten, with five, with two, are called to give an account of their improvement doth evidently ſhew, that there is no good thing we have, let it be health, wealth, riches, but we as Stewards muſt be reckoned with concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the good improvement of them; Oh beloved, what an overwhelming
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:65216:68"/>
conſideration is this, to think the time is coming when every thought, every word, every hour, every day, every opportunity, every penny, every thing I have had will be called for, who can hear theſe things and not tremble? Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver think all thy ſins are forgotten, no, the Scripture attributes a Book to God, God writeth down every thing, and thoſe Books will be opened, what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of perſons ſhould we be who beleeve theſe things? <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.11. Is it for you to live riotouſly, to follow all vain pleaſures and delights, or not rather to pray and mourn, and bethink your ſelves what is to be done at this time.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <note place="margin">II. The meaneſt perſons have Talents to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove as well as the greateſt.</note>2. Take notice <hi>That there is no man or woman though never ſo inconſiderable, but they have their ſeverall Talents</hi>: They have their peculiar work to doe, and their proper relations to ſerve God in; There is none but they have their courſe to finiſh, they have the work of God to do, and therefore let no man think it may be for Magiſtrates, for Miniſters, for great men, for rich men, to look to thoſe things, but not ſuch inferiour perſons as they: No, he that had but one Talent, that is the leaſt ability and opportunity to glorifie God, yet becauſe he was negligent, he is called <hi>an unprofitable ſervant, and is caſt out, where there is weeping, and gnaſhing of teeth</hi>; So then barrenneſſe and unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableneſſe in our places and relations, will be a damning ſinne, yet who conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders this? Do I promote the glory of God? Is God honoured by me in my place and calling? Do not I hide my talent in a Napkin? Am I able to anſwer for my great neglect? For thy health, who can ſpeak for that? For time and many daies given to repent, who can ſpeak for that? Theſe things will be fire in your bones, They will be thunder in your ears, and arrows in your heart, though for the preſent thou doſt not matter them.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">III. None are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect diſcharges of their duty.</note>Thirdly, <hi>Though it be the duty upon all thus to glorifie God, and do our work commanded, yet none is able to be perfect in this</hi>; None ever lived that could challenge a Crown of glory for his perfect ſervice; Indeed Chriſt he being God and man did all theſe things without ſinne, therefore he was a full Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atour for us, God had nothing, the Law had nothing to object againſt him, but every meer man hath a woe belonging to his beſt life, to his beſt duties, if God judge him in ſtrict juſtice· Hence <hi>David</hi> praieth, that <hi>God would not enter into judgement with him,</hi> that he would not mark <hi>every thing done amiſſe</hi>; Why? becauſe <hi>in thy ſight no fleſh ſhall be juſtified,</hi> Pſa. 143.2. So <hi>David</hi> doth not only exclude himſelf, for he had murther and adultery, and many other things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe in his life, but <hi>no fleſh ſhall be juſtified</hi>; None though preſerved from ſuch fals. And <hi>Paul</hi> whom you have heard acknowledging <hi>the good fight he had fought,</hi> and looking for a Crown of glory, yet doth not challenge any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, for at another time he accounts all things <hi>dung and droſſe,</hi> and <hi>would be found in Chriſt,</hi> Phil. 3. <hi>having the righteouſneſſe by faith,</hi> ſo that all doctrines of perfection, and a poſſibility to be without ſinne in this life are but the proud dreams of carnal men.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">IV. No merit or cauſality of ſalvation in the beſt work.</note>Therefore Fourthly, <hi>No ſervice or works that we have done are any waies me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious, or have any cauſal influence upon our Salvation</hi>: It's very hard to preach the neceſſity of all holy and good works, and not preſently to look on them as merits and cauſes of Salvation; but we ſee the Scripture doth both, and therefore we are to reconcile them in our practiſe; To be zealous of good works, yet to rely only on Chriſts merits; It's not my purpoſe here to give you ſeveral grounds why the beſt holy action we do comes ſhort of all kinde of merit; It's enough to inform you <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. that <hi>beleeving</hi> and <hi>work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> are oppoſed, and ſo <hi>works</hi> and <hi>grace,</hi> and indeed to hold the fulneſſe of Chriſts merits, and yet to pleade our own, is to think that the light of the Sun is not able to make perfect day, unleſſe we light a candle alſo; There cannot be any more two meritorious cauſes of ſalvation, then there can be two
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:65216:68"/>
Suns in the Orb; Chriſt will not have a copartner under any diſtinction what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever in the work of our Redemption; As for the doctrine or thoughts of perfection, let thoſe be abandoned, Let us walk humbly, and lowly under our imperfections, yet breathing after perfection.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, <hi>Becauſe no works we do can be perfect, hence at the end of our daies,</hi>
               <note place="margin">V.</note> 
               <hi>when we look over all our former life, we may not put any truſt or confidence in what we have done</hi>; Paul <hi>that knew nothing by himſelf, yet was not thereby juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied</hi>: The Phariſees are condemned for this, that they truſted in their own righteouſneſſe, yea, the whole Nation of the Jews, that they <hi>went about to eſtabliſh their own righteouſneſſe, and would not ſubmit to the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt,</hi> Rom. 10. Though ſelf-righteouſneſſe be not a groſſe ſcandalous ſinne, making men abominable and no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſome in the world, yet it is as damnable and as dangerous as thoſe ſins, yea, more damnable, partly becauſe it overthroweth all the principles of being cured, None being more miſerable then thoſe who are ſo, yet do not feel or think ſo; This is like the Pſalmiſts <hi>arrow</hi> that <hi>deſtroieth at mid-day,</hi> and then partly becauſe it doth ſo immediatly oppoſe Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed as a Mediatour and Saviour, for they that truſt in their own righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe are a Chriſt, are a Saviour to themſelves.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Though all this be true, our godlineſſe is no merit,<note place="margin">VI.</note> no ground of confidence, <hi>yet a faithful zealous performing of thoſe duties God hath required of us may as a ſign and evidence wonderfully comfort and imbolden our hearts:</hi> As the Rainbow is not a cauſe but a ſign that God will never deſtroy the world more by water, ſo this tenderneſſe and diligence of thine in all the waies of God are not a cauſe but a ſure ſigne that Gods eternal love is placed on thee, and that thou art in the number of thoſe who are prepared for glory, our rejoycing is this, ſaith <hi>Paul, the teſtimony of a good conſcience,</hi> 2 Cor. 1.12. and 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.21. <hi>Hereby we are ſure he heareth us, if our hearts condemn us not; Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> did not mention their good life, as a cauſe or means; Neither did they put confidence in them, only they took this as a comfortable ſigne they were in the favour of God, and they looked upon theſe things as inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable qualifications; Even as <hi>Rahabs</hi> thred hanging out of the window was not a cauſe but a ſigne that ſhe was in the number of thoſe who were exempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from deſtruction, and in this ſence we maintain the doctrine, <hi>That it's a bleſſed thing at the end of our daies to have this teſtimony, this cordial in our hearts.</hi>

               <hi>though they may have comfort for the main, yet will greatly diſhearten and diminiſh their joy then.</hi> There will be fears againſt hope, doubts againſt faith, agonies againſt joy: That even as nature and death will in a terrible manner conflict together, ſo will their hopes and fears: Yet this is not to be underſtood, but that even a Chriſtian walking moſt tenderly and circumſpectly, may at his death have no joy and aſſurance: God for many juſt and wiſe ends doth ſometimes diſpenſe it ſo, that he who lived very holily, may yet die very uncomfortably. It was ſo with Chriſt, though there was a peculiar reaſon, and why not with his members? only when God dealeth ſo, they are meer exerciſes to increaſe their Crown of glory; they are not ſo properly afflictions for ſinne, as <hi>Job</hi> had thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary trials, not for ſinne, though he was not without ſinne, but triall, and thereby to make him more glorious.

the ſoul, that when a man comes to die, theſe earthly things lye upon the heart, as too much undigeſted meat upon the ſtomack, making thee extream ſick and full of pain. The Apoſtle then, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. preſcribeth a comfortable way to dye joyfully, where he ſaith, <hi>thoſe that buy muſt be as if they bought not; they that marry as if they married not:</hi> The greener the wood is, the harder to be conſumed; the more lively and active thy worldly affections are, there muſt be the greater oppoſition to leave all and be with God. The ripe aple falleth from the tree very eaſily: the godly man dying is compared to ripe corn, ſo that if theſe earthy and worldly affections be not dried up in thee, it will much hinder thy joy, this green wood will make a great ſmoak. <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> though he had this comfortable evidence, yet ſaith the Text, <hi>He wept ſoar</hi>; ſome attribute that to the Old Teſtament diſpenſation, where earthly and worldly happineſſe was more generally promiſed then under the New, and therefore death being a privation of that, did more affect them: howſoever this is ſure, an heart not weaned from the world, and yet muſt be parted from, is like a tooth not cut from the fleſh, which will cauſe great pain in the pulling out. If therefore thou wouldſt with much peace and joy make up thy account, ſit looſe from all earthly things; theſe are good, but God is better; to have God would be a gain to thee, theſe are thorns and thorns in thy ſide, they do not only choak our duty, but our comforts.</p>

Theſe thoughts will be ſo many drops of gall in thy hony: Therefore the Apoſtle preſſeth that duty to <hi>redeem the time,</hi> Epheſ. 4.16. to take all the occaſions and opportunities before thee: We are commanded to learn of the unreaſonable creatures, that know their times and ſeaſons. Chriſts tears over <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> Luk. 19.41. were becauſe ſhe did not know her day; God doth give many gracious occaſions, which it may be will never be injoyed more. Now as thoſe that did not go out early to gather Manna, could not have any afterwards, though they would have laboured many hours; and as thoſe that did not ſtep into the Pool, while the Angel deſcended, could not upon any terms have the benefit afterwards, ſo it is here, if thou take not the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,

It's true, there is no man dying, but may be greatly afflicted for miſ-ſpent opportunities, therefore you heard no man could put any confidence in the beſt improved life that can be, only he is happy that hath leſſe worms gnawing upon his conſcience then others: Oh then take this home with thee, thou godly ſoul, when Chriſt knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth at the door there is an opportunity of doing or receiving good, take heed with the Church, thou do not make excuſes, and ſo make Chriſt depart, thou maieſt afterward ſearch for him in the anguiſh of thy heart, and not finde him.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Chriſt in the ſtate of humiliation was inferiour to God, and ſo he did referre all things to his Fathers glory, ſo that in this profeſſion we may conſider,

            <p>The <hi>matter</hi> is our ſalvation, and that redemption Chriſt purchaſed for us: The <hi>end</hi> which Chriſt looked at in all this was chiefly the glory of God: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he looked alſo at his own glory and our glory, but the ultimate and chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of all was Gods glory, So that from hence we may obſerve,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That our redemption and ſalvation obtained by Chriſt is a glorifying of God,</hi>

               <hi>and Chriſt did thereby chiefly aim at Gods glory</hi>; We put both the matter of Gods glory and Chriſts end together; and certainly this Truth diſcovered will be like that ſweet box of perfume which opened, cauſed ſuch a fragrant ſmell.</p>
            <p>And 1. Let us ſee how or <hi>wherein God was thus glorified by Chriſts Mediation for us</hi>: It being of infinite comfort to know this, for how many times are we apt to be caſt down? What are we that God ſhould regard our ſalvation? who are we that God ſhould crown us with glory? God doth not need us, he is happy without us; Now this may exceedingly encourage, Though we be not worthy to be ſaved, God is worthy to be glorified; If there were nothing but our good and happineſſe involved in Chriſts death, who would think it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable Chriſt ſhould ſuffer meerly and ultimately for us, but there is alſo the glory of God deeply concerned, which is more worth then all the world, yea, then all our ſouls, for though one ſoul be more worth then a world, yet Gods glory is more worth then all our ſouls and their ſalvation; So that a Chriſtian fixing his faith and meditation here may be in a transfiguration, and ſay, <hi>It is good to be here</hi>; God doth not loſe by thy Salvation, If Gods ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:65216:73"/>
were to be impaired, if his truth broken, if his juſtice violated, then who dare open his mouth for ſalvation? but God is a gainer as well as thou art; It's no wrong or loſſe to God if he give pardon to thee, yea, thou art able to make it out of Scripture grounds, that God is more glorified hereby, and ſo when the ſalvation of our ſouls ſhall prove Gods intereſt more then ours, this muſt needs greatly encourage.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> Firſt therefore, <hi>The grace, mercy and goodneſſe of God is by our redemption through Chriſt admirably exalted</hi>: Now Gods goodneſſe and his mercy is that which doth highly exalt him; When <hi>Moſes</hi> deſired to ſee the glory of God <hi>Exo.</hi> 34.6. then God made this Proclamation, that he was <hi>merciful, long-ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ready to forgive</hi>; Thoſe attributes that declare his mercy, they make him glorious; Now there never was or can be ſuch an Inſtance of Gods grace, love, and goodneſſe, as in our ſalvation by Chriſt; God never did any thing by which he can have ſuch a Name for mercy as in this; The Church of God hath had many deliverances and great external favours, for which ſhe hath been much in praiſing and glorifying of God, but God never exalted himſelf and made himſelf ſo glorious as by this; The Church was greatly affected, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 136. with the goodneſſe of God, when enumerating the ſeverall Inſtances of Gods mercy, ſhe addeth in every verſe, <hi>For his mercy endureth for ever, For his mercy endureth for ever</hi>; Oh but how maiſt thou go over all thoſe things, <hi>Chriſt did for thee,</hi> adding, <hi>His mercy endureth for ever; He died and roſe again for the remiſſion of thy ſins, for his mercy endureth for ever, he obtained the ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of thy nature, For his mercy endureth for ever,</hi> And in thoſe temporall deliverances, though Gods mercy as an attribure in him endured for ever, yet the effect of his mercy did not, for both theſe mercies, and they themſelves periſhed, but here <hi>the effects of his mercy will endure for ever</hi>; So then ſeeing God doth all things for his glory and his name, inſomuch that <hi>Joſhua</hi> urged this as a great argument with God, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 7.9. <hi>What wilt thou do unto thy great Name?</hi> It cannot be but that our redemption by Chriſt muſt needs be acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptable to him, becauſe his Name is moſt exalted thereby, we may ſay Gods thoughts, his heart and delight was more upon this then any thing elſe he e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver did; Theſe attributes of God, his goodneſſe, his love, his long-ſuffering, his grace, Divines makes a diſtinction of them, but in our ſalvation through Chriſt, they were all conjoyned; There they were all in their higheſt glory, <hi>Gods love</hi> is that whereby he wils good to the creature, now in his creation or preſervation he doth not will that good, which he doth in our redemption, <hi>Gods goodneſſe</hi> is that whereby though full in himſelf and ſufficient, yet he would communicate unto the creature; Now in nothing did God ever com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate as in this; in other things, he giveth creatures, here he giveth <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf:</hi> In other things he vouchſafeth fading, decaying comforts, here is <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall</hi>; In other things he giveth but drops and crums, here he giveth the <hi>ocean,</hi> he fils us up with happineſſe, that the ſoul ſaith it hath enough, eſpecially Gods grace is ſeen in no thing but this, the Creation of the world, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing other mercies, is never attributed to grace; this is peculiar for our ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Oh then what hope is here when we ſhall conſider, there never was, there never can be any thing wherein God may be ſo glorified as in our ſalvation by Chriſt, urge this duty at the Throne of grace, O Lord, It is not my cauſe but thy cauſe; The devil oppoſeth not ſo much my ſalvation as thy glory there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by: As they ſaid to <hi>David, Thou ſhalt not go with us, Thou art worth ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand of us</hi>; Do thou urge, Let not thy glory be in danger that is worth all our ſouls.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> 2. <hi>The wiſedom of God is greatly glorified by Chriſts Mediation for us,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.24. <hi>We preach Chriſt the wiſodom of God,</hi> why ſo?

man as he hath through Chriſt, if you do regard by the remedy it ſelf Chriſt God and man, the uſe of this remedy by faith only excluding all works, we may then cry out, <hi>Oh the unſearchable depths of the manifold wiſedom of God</hi>; The Apoſtle cals it <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; Even as in a curious work of Tapeſtry, there are ſeveral expreſſions of arts; <hi>David</hi> is affected with Gods wiſedom in making every part of him; <hi>Thou didſt curiouſly work me in my Mothers womb,</hi> as ſo much choice Needle-work, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 139.15. but farre more wiſedom was ſeen in redeeming and ſaving, eſpecially the wiſedom of God was herein wonderful, that whereas upon man fallen his eſtate ſeemed deſperate and incurable, on one ſide Mercy was willing to help and releeve, but on the other ſide Juſtice did interpoſe, and ſaid it could not; Now the wiſedom of God found out ſuch an excellent temperament, that mercy might plentifully demonſtrate it ſelf, yet Juſtice be ſatisfied; ſo that in mans ſalvation there was a merciful juſtice, and a juſt mercy cooperant together, <hi>Solomons</hi> wiſedom was greatly admired for deciding that hard controverſie about the living childe, but here was a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er inſtance of wiſedom to finde, out a way for our ſalvation; We reade of an excellent temperament found out by one Law-giver, who having made a Law that every adulterer ſhould have both his eyes boared out, it ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that the Law-givers own Son was taken in Adultery, Now mercy on one ſide moved the Father to ſpare him, yet Juſtice on the other ſide hindred; The Father therefore commanded one of his Sons eyes ſhould be put out, and yeelded that one of his eyes ſhould be put out for the other eye of his Sonnes. Here the Law and Juſtice was ſatisfied, as alſo the mercy of the Father diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered; This is greatly applauded in hiſtories, though hardly is the fact juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable, but it is a meer ſhadow to this excellent temperament the wiſedom of God found out, Oh that ever any ſoul under any perplexity whatſoever ſhould be caſt down or ſay, how can I be delivered in this? how ſhall this ever tend to my good? for what is it greater then to finde out a way to ſave thee? yet God hath done that.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> 3. <hi>The power of God is hereby glorified</hi>; We reade of many inſtances wherein God hath revealed his power to the world, That all the world hath been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to ſay, <hi>Great is the might and Majecty of God: Who is a God like the true God doing great and wonderful things?</hi> But this of our ſalvation by Chriſt tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends all, Therefore 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.14. <hi>Chriſt</hi> is called <hi>the power of God,</hi> for by this means a greater power then any earthly power is ſubdued, even the <hi>principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> and <hi>powers of hell</hi>; Now ſaith Chriſt when he was to ſuffer, <hi>the Prince of this world is judged,</hi> Joh. 16.11. By the <hi>blowing of Rams horns the wals of Jericho fell down,</hi> but here by contemptible and weak things, the gates of hell fall to the ground; The devil that had power over mens hearts, and kept men captive in their luſts, is wholly conquered; Alas all the power done in temporal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverances cannot be compared to this redemption; It's true, the eye of faith and not of the body muſt admire this.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/> Laſtly, <hi>God is glorified in his Juſtice,</hi> and that more then the heart of man can conceive, for although in reſpect of us there be nothing but grace, and all that we have and receive is mercy, yet in reſpect of Chriſt there was exact juſtice, God laid our ſins upon him, he became a Surety in our ſtead, he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoeth that wrath, that curſe that did belong to us, God did not abate of any thing that Chriſt could ſuffer without ſinne, ſo that we have not the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of our ſins upon any unjuſt and unlawful terms; The Law and Juſtice can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not complain: Gods juſtice then againſt ſinne is abundantly ſeen in that, though Chriſt was the only beloved of the Father, yet he is not ſpared but muſt be made a curſe, and endure the wrath due unto us, ſo that if a man would conſider what arguments ſhould keep him from ſinne, if he would be affected with Gods wrath againſt it, let him look on Chriſt crucified, oh how
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:65216:74"/>
can it be that ſinne ſhould be ſo pleaſing and delightfull unto thee which was ſo bitter and full of wrath to Chriſt: Would not God ſpare his own Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, but his juſtice muſt be ſatisfied through Chriſt, then what may wicked men expect? Are they able to conflict with Gods wrath? Can they ſatisfie his juſtice? This bloud of Chriſt <hi>though it ſpeak better things then that of Abel</hi> to the godly, yet it's more terrible then that to the wicked, for thereby it te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifieth that God will have bloud, he muſt have an atonement for ſinne, and that cannot be by thy ſufferings though in hell: Therefore Gods juſtice is more glorified by Chriſt then by the damned in hell, for there they are never able completely to ſatisfie, therefore they are kept in thoſe chains to all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: The debt is never paid, but Chriſt diſcharged all to the utmoſt, and therefore the grave could not contain him; Thus you ſee how in every reſpect God is glorified by our ſalvation through Chriſt; Though <hi>to us a Son be given,</hi> and <hi>to us a childe was born,</hi> Iſa. 9.6. (He was a Saviour and Mediatour in reſpect of us not himſelf,) yet all this did at laſt referre to Gods glory; That was the Ocean in which this ſtream did empty it ſelf; Thus you have heard wherein God was glorified by Chriſt.</p>
            <p>In the next place conſider the end that Chriſt did propound in all his doings and ſufferings, I mean the <hi>ultimate and chief end</hi> not the <hi>proxime</hi> or <hi>immediate</hi> end, and that alſo was to glorifie God, his chiefeſt end was not either to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie himſelf or us, theſe were ſubordinate ends.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Not himſelf, hence <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. <hi>I ſeek not my own glory but the glory of him that ſent me</hi>; It's true, he is ſaid to have an eye to the end of his ſufferings, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. and the Scripture makes his exaltation a conſequent of his humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet this was not chiefeſt in his thoughts: The name and glory God gave him exalting him above every great thing, was not principally regarded by him, but the glory of God: So that by this we ſee how precious the glory of God ſhould be to us, how deer in our eſteem; When we ſee Chriſt preferring it above his own glory; The aim that Chriſt had did ariſe from that love and zeal he had to God, for none can referre all things to Gods glory who do not love him above all things, who do not give him the preheminency in every thing: One ſaid, <hi>Fiat juſtitia &amp; ruat mundus,</hi> Let the glory of God be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted though the whole world be ruined thereby, as love to God, ſo purity of intentions, and an excellent rectitude of the heart is requiſite, elſe ſelf-love and ſelf-reſpect will be more prevalent then Gods glory.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>As Chriſt did not principally intend his own glory, ſo neither our happineſſe, but only as the means to glorifie God</hi>; Becauſe Gods glory is ſo deeply intereſſed in our ſalvation, therefore did he procure it; He did not glorifie God that we might be ſaved, but he ſaved us that thereby God might be glorified, yet this doth not at all derogate from the Love of Chriſt to us, neither doth it make us the leſſe beholding to him though he would not have ſaved us, had it not been for Gods glory; But hereby he demonſtrated both his love to us, and God at the ſame time, he loved our ſouls and ſalvation, yet not above the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God, That would have been unlawfull; Therefore at the ſame time he did demonſtrate both his love to us and to God, and yet kept the due order that ought to be in his love firſt to God, and then next to us.</p>

have procured our ſalvation for other ends then to glorifie God, it had been ſinne in him, for if God be ſo jealous of his glory that he will not have it at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to any other beſide himſelf, how much would his jealouſie have been provoked if this matter wherein his glory is moſt viſible, ſhould have been given to any other, Gods glory then is the ſupreme and univerſal end to which all are to ſubordinate themſelves.</p>

Oh how often do we deſire theſe outward mercies for our own eaſe, our own benefit, and not thereby to glorifie God; Shall Chriſt look be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all theſe great acts he did to the glory of God? and ſhalt not thou look beyond thy health, wealth, and all outward greatneſſe to the glory of God?

muſt this be? Now Gods glory muſt be leſſe in thy condemnation then in thy ſalvation for a twofold reſpect, 1. As you heard, <hi>The attributes of God are not made ſo glorious in one as in the other</hi>; That the goodneſſe, mercy, and grace of God is not ſo illuſtrious none can deny, and as for his juſtice and power which might claim the preheminence in mans condemnation, yet they are not ſo cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated, for Gods juſtice is but <hi>in fieri,</hi> It's not compleated, They lie in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of hell but are never able to pay the debt; The penal ſufferings of a creature cannot recompence that honour and glory to God, which the voluntary ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of him who was both God and man did, ſo that juſtice is far more conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous, and as for Gods power that alſo is viſibly more noble, for to be able to ſave one is more glorious then to damn many; It's harder to ſave then to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn. 2. <hi>The glory of God is more magnified in our ſalvation, becauſe thoſe that are ſaved are affected with this infinite goodneſſe of God</hi>; They ſpeak of it, they aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate it, as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> ſaid, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38.19. <hi>Do the dead praiſe thee? The living, the living they will ſpeak of thy goodneſſe</hi>; Thus it is here; Do the damned in hell glorifie God? Do they praiſe him? Do they ſing out their Allelujahs? No, they ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rage and blaſpheme God; Oh then how ſtrong is this in thy praier: <hi>O Lord if thou lay my ſins upon me, if they preſſe me into hell, ſhall I then love thee? Shall I then glorifie thee? Do not the juſtified, the ſanctified, the ſaved ſpeak of thy praiſes all the day long.</hi> 3 In that God is thus glorified by thy ſalvation, thou maiſt make it Gods cauſe, his intereſt, <hi>O Lord, I have ſins enough to damn me, I am worthy to be thrown into hell, but though I am unworthy to be ſaved, thou art worthy to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured; O Lord, becauſe I have deſerved hell, doth thy Name deſerve to be diſhonour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?</hi> Obſerve how the people of God in all their miſeries ſtill engaged Gods Name in their help, <hi>for his Names ſake,</hi> as if they had ſaid, <hi>O Lord, though we are unworthy to be delivered, yet thy Name is worthy to be honoured; It's no matter for us Lord, but what will become of thy great Name, O Lord the diſhonour will redound more to thee then the loſſe to us</hi>; Oh this is ſtrong and comfortable to conſider, how Gods glory is intereſted in thy happineſſe, ſo that it's Gods cauſe more then thine, yea, and why do the devils thus deſire to draw thee into ſin and hell? Is it not chiefly becauſe of their enmity againſt God? It's not ſo much thy dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation as the diſhonour to God they look at; Though they hate both, yet they hate God moſt, and thus thou haſt unanſwerable arguments in this particular. And if you ſay,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Obj.</hi>
               </note> it being thus, <hi>Why are not all ſaved, would not God have the more glory?</hi>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi>
               </note> I anſwer, God doth not need any glory from the creature, he needeth not the glory that Angels and Saints give him; If he therefore for juſt and wiſe grounds known to himſelf juſtifieth ſome and condemneth others, even in this he is to be acknowledged a glorious God needing no creature, ſo that though he may do as he pleaſe, yet we muſt urge the arguments he puts in our mouths.</p>

               <hi>

Then do thou likewiſe, joyn all thy profit, all thy comforts and his glory together; Say, oh it's not enough that I am eaſed or am advantaged, unleſſe I ſee alſo God be glorified.</p>

            <p>THE former part, which contained Chriſts holy <hi>profeſſion of the end he had in all that he did and ſuffered on earth,</hi> hath been diſpatched. We now come to conſider the Means wherein, or by which, and that in the later part. And herein conſider the <hi>means or manner</hi> it ſelf, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed under this notion, <hi>Work.</hi> Chriſt came not into the world to have his eaſe and pleaſure and outward glory, but to <hi>Work:</hi> This obedience of his it was both <hi>active</hi> and <hi>paſſive.</hi> 2. Here is the deſcription of the <hi>nature</hi> or <hi>quality</hi> of this <hi>work,</hi> that which was given him by the Father to do, ſo that in all this there was a ſtipulation and an agreement with the Father. 3. There is his <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge</hi> of it, I have <hi>finiſhed</hi> it: He did not leave it half done, there is nothing more can be required of Chriſt: This is a comfortable truth, for wo be to us, if Chriſt had not diſcharged all, if there had been any ſupply to be made by us.</p>
            <p>If you ſay, How could Chriſt ſay he had finiſhed his work,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi>
               </note> when yet the dregs of the cup were to be drunk up, the worſt ſeem'd to be behind, <hi>viz.</hi> all that agony and ſorrow he was to ſuffer?</p>
            <p>Firſt <hi>Auſtin</hi> anſwers it, by reading it in the future tenſe, <hi>I will finiſh thy work:</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi>
               </note> but that cannot be. The beſt anſwer is, that Chriſt thus ſpeaks, becauſe all was now at hand to be finiſhed, he was in a prepared and ready diſpoſition to conſummate all, as we reade he ſaid a little before his death, <hi>It's finiſhed, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummatum eſt.</hi> Now the Scripture accounts that as done, which is immediatly to be done, and the man is ready to do it: Thus <hi>Abraham,</hi> Heb. 11. is ſaid <hi>to offer up his ſonne Iſaac,</hi> and to receive him from the dead, when yet actually he did not offer him, but he was immediatly fitted for it.</p>
            <p>Obſ. <hi>Chriſt did fully and perfectly finiſh that work the Father gave him to do.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Obſerv.</hi> That Chriſt did fully and perfectly finiſh that work the Father gave him to do.</note> 
               <hi>John</hi> 4.34. ſee what a notable expreſſion our Saviour uſeth to this purpoſe, <hi>My meat is to do the will of him that ſent me; My meat, i. e.</hi> my joy, my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing; never any hungry man was more refreſhed by food, then I am in doing my Fathers will, and what was that will, <hi>to obtain pardon and ſalvation for a poor humbled ſinner.</hi> Oh why ſhould the godly ſoul be dejected with doubts, whether Chriſt will receive him or no, it's his meat to be communicating grace and mercy to thee; Thou canſt not ſo much deſire him as he doth thee: Again he addes, <hi>To do my Fathers will and to finiſh his work</hi>; for if Chriſt had begun it and not compleated it, we had been ſtill in our ſinnes, and without all hope;
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:65216:76"/>
this is the fountain of all our hope and joy, Chriſt finiſhed his work, he did not leave any thing for me to do. Indeed duties are required of us, but not as <hi>additaments</hi> or <hi>ſuppliments</hi> to his mediation, but as qualifications fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting us to partake of the fruit of it.<note place="margin">Obſerve theſe particulars. 1.</note> Let us dive into the Divinity of this Point; And</p>
            <p n="1">
               <note place="margin">1.</note>1. Conſider, <hi>That Chriſt might have come into the world, as a glorious Lord and Lawgiver, only to rule and to give Laws, but coming into the world as a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator and a Surety, it behoved him to be under a Law, and to diſcharge that work he undertook.</hi> That Chriſt might have been in the world not ſubject to the Law, or obliged to do any thing for our good is plain, becauſe his <hi>Incarnation</hi> was not neceſſary, he was not compelled to it, he might have choſen whether he would thus undertake for man or no; therefore the Scripture ſaith, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. <hi>He made himſelf of no reputation,</hi> and <hi>He became obedient to the death of the croſſe.</hi> It was wholly at his own good pleaſure; but ſuppoſe this will and purpoſe of his, then there was <hi>a duty and charge laid upon him</hi> to perform all he was betru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted with, he would have been found unfaithfull, had he not done every thing to the uttermoſt.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <note place="margin">2. A Covenant between God the Father and the Sonne.</note>2. <hi>There was a holy and admirable agreement between God the Father and the Sonne, to be a Mediator for thoſe his Father had given him.</hi> Hence it is that he ſaith ſo often <hi>his Father had ſent him,</hi> and <hi>I came to do the will of him that ſent me.</hi> Although the Covenant of grace be made with beleevers, yet there was a previous and antecedent Covenant or agreement between the Father and the Sonne to be a Mediator, and the agreement was, that if Chriſt would lay down his life for ſuch, then the Father would give them to him as his ſeed and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie them, as alſo reward him with all honour and glory. That Chriſt was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded with all honour, appeareth, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. and in other places, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of his work done as a Mediator; and that he had a ſeed given him, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, in that it's ſaid, <hi>he ſhould ſee of his ſeed and be ſatisfied,</hi> Iſa. 53.11. The Arminian doctrine therefore that holds an Univerſall Redemption in imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion only, and not application, maketh it poſſible that his ſoul might be in all that travell, and yet he not be ſatisfied, for not one might be ſaved. There was then this admirable agreement between the Father and the Sonne tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted in heaven, they were purpoſing good to beleevers, even before they had a being, or could have any deſires for their own good.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <note place="margin">3. Chriſts work truiy and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note>3. <hi>From this Covenant and agreement it is that Chriſts work is truly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly obedience:</hi> for it may be asked, How could Chriſt be ſaid to obey, ſeeing he could not but do Gods will? there was an inward neceſſity from the <hi>Hypoſtaticall union,</hi> and as we do not ſay, the ſervice that Angels and Saints do in heaven is properly obedience, for then that ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded with a new heaven,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi>
               </note> and ſo <hi>in infinitum,</hi> Why then can it be ſaid, that Chriſts doing and ſuffering is obedience?<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi>
               </note> To this we Anſwer, The Scripture doth expreſly call it obedience, and ſuch an obedience as hath a reward annexed to it: Hence <hi>John</hi> 10.8. Chriſt cals it <hi>the Commandment which he had received from his Father.</hi> And whereas it's ſaid, Chriſt neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obeyed, and ſo it could not be otherwiſe, it's true, ſuppoſing his will to be a Mediator, then ſuch was his holineſſe, that he could not but be faithfull, yet this was not a naturall neceſſity, as the fire burneth, but a neceſſity of immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tability, ariſing from the perfection of his nature, neither is to ſinne, of the eſſence of liberty, but it's a defect, and doth accompany only a mutable liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in what is good. Let it therefore be firmly beleeved, that all which Chriſt did,<note place="margin">4. Chriſts obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience was meriting obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</note> it was truly and properly obedience to the Law of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.19. <hi>By the obedience of one,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>This was not meerly obedience, but a meriting obedience</hi>; ſo that our ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and his glory was not due to him meerly as ſuch, by vertue of a promiſe,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:65216:76"/>
or by congruity, but from condignity; although concerning the later, <hi>viz.</hi> meriting his own glory, many ſound Divines think otherwiſe. There was an intrinſecall worth and excellency in Chriſts obedience anſwering to our ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Hence though we have our Juſtification and Salvation of grace and meer grace, yet in reſpect of Chriſt it was of juſtice and debt, ſo that in Chriſt the Covenant of works was fulfilled, though in us the Covenant of grace; and this conſideration laieth a firm and ſure foundation for our peace and comfort. For our ſalvation is not grounded upon our works, but Chriſts works; it's not upon any perfection or fulneſſe in us, but on Chriſt: Though therefore our ſinnes and frailties may humble us, yet they may not drive us from our anchor of hope in Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>This work Chriſt was to do, it was in it ſelf very heavy and grievous,</hi>
               <note place="margin">5. Chriſts work heavy and grievous.</note> 
               <hi>though his readineſſe made it eaſie.</hi> If we conſider the particulars of his work, <hi>viz.</hi> to obey the Law of God, and to ſuffer all the wrath that was due for our ſins, we may eaſily then conclude, that Chriſt had a bitter cup to drink off: And thoſe praiers and agonies which he poured out, ſaying, <hi>If it be poſſible let this cup paſſe away,</hi> Matth. 26.39. abundantly ſhew that to the humane nature it was a very hard and difficult task, yet for all this his love and deſire of our ſalvation was ſo great, that at another time he ſaith, <hi>I have a baptiſm to be baptized with, and how am I ſtreightned</hi> till I come? and when <hi>Peter</hi> adviſed him <hi>to ſave himſelf,</hi> with what indignation doth he refuſe it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.23. ſo that we ſhould with ſerious and affectionate hearts hear of this work of Chriſt, oh how full of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonies and conflicts was he, inſomuch that an Angell from heaven came to comfort him, yet all this was his meat, his refreſhment in reſpect of our good. Do not thou then ſay of any duty he commands, if it be to pull out thy right eye, to cut off thy right hand, to part with thy deareſt luſts and comforts for his ſake: This is hard work, who can do it? for did not Chriſt willingly and joyfully do harder for thee.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>This work he finiſhed and compleated,</hi> as you hear in the text;<note place="margin">6. He finiſhed his work.</note> it's the end that Crowned this great work; Now his finiſhing of this work was in theſe particulars:</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>He did it wholly and univerſally,</hi> there was not one <hi>Iota</hi> or tittle of the Law, which he did not accompliſh, though all our obedience be imperfect, and we fail in many things, this we omit, and that we omit, yet Chriſt left no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing undone: Oh what bleſſed and comfortable doctrine is this to the loaded and burdened ſoul, that ſits mourning like deflowred <hi>Tamar,</hi> and <hi>I whither ſhall I go?</hi> if the Lord enquire about this duty, and about that command, thou canſt not anſwer, thy omiſſions are too palpable, thou canſt not hide them from thy own eyes, yet remember Chriſt failed in nothing: <hi>Curſed is he that abideth not in all things,</hi> ſo the Law runneth; if thou wert able to do all the Law requireth, and yet fail but in one word, in one thought, that matters not all thy other duties, for this one thing it will condemn thee, and therefore the Law brings every man under condemnation, it makes the moſt holy of men ſee their damnable condition, but Chriſt anſwereth the Law to the utmoſt: As Chriſt ſaid to his enemies, <hi>Which of you can charge me with ſinne?</hi> ſo he may ſay to greater then they, even to the Law, even to the juſtice of God, wherein can you finde any ſpot in me, demand to the utmoſt farthing, abate nothing, I am ready to diſcharge all.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>He finiſhed it univerſally for parts, and not only ſo, but fully for degrees:</hi> He did not only do every duty the Law required, but every duty in every de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees: he did not only love God, but he loved him as much as the Law requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. The Law was poſſible to him, though to us it be impoſſible; all that he did was ſo fully done, that there wanted not the leaſt degree of grace in any duty. As he had not the Spirit in meaſure, ſo neither was his obedience in
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:65216:77"/>
meaſure, thus farre as is with us, to whom God giveth not ſuch a meaſure of grace, as to be able perfectly to conform to the Law in this life; and here again the godly heart may lift up it ſelf and be comforted, for what though thou come ſhort many degrees of what the Law requireth, yet Chriſt did not: What though all thou doſt may be better, yet Chriſt did all things ſo, that they could not be better, <hi>Perfectum eſt cui nihil deeſt:</hi> Now nothing was want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Chriſts obedience, otherwiſe Chriſt himſelf would have needed a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor as well as we; if he had failed in his truſt he had been guilty of ſinne, and ſo needing of pardon; now it were blaſphemy to ſay ſo of Chriſt, for the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.27. aggravateth and preferreth Chriſt our Highprieſt above the legall Highprieſt in this, becauſe ſuch an one was <hi>to offer for his own ſinnes, as well as the ſinnes of the people.</hi> Oh then it's no wonder if <hi>Paul</hi> be thus affected with Chriſt, and his righteouſneſſe, ſeeing all fulneſſe and perfection is in it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Chriſt finiſhed his work, becauſe he had not only an objective perfection in parts and degrees, but alſo a ſubjective perfection, all within him was throughly and perfectly holy</hi>; ſo that whereas we are both originally and actually polluted, he was originally and actually holy, ſo that the Law had no fault to finde with him; for his originall and native holineſſe, it's plain, becauſe he was not born of man in an ordinary way, but the holy Ghoſt overſhadowed the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and therefore he is called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>that holy thing which was to be born of her,</hi> Luke 1.35. and thus the Apoſtle, <hi>It behoved us to have an Highprieſt, holy and ſeparated from ſinners,</hi> Heb. 7.26. and indeed this is the foundation and root of all, for the tree muſt be good, before the fruit can; the fountain muſt be clean, ere the ſtreams, and ſo the nature muſt be holy ere the actions are. Chriſt then had an holy and pure nature, wherein was not the leaſt ſpot or wrincle of ſinne, and then his actuall holineſſe did fill up the faculties of his ſoul, as he had a ſoul and the naturall properties thereof, an underſtanding and a will, ſo theſe were ſanctified to the higheſt; we ſpeak not of the holineſſe of his Divine nature, as he was God, for ſo it was infinite, even as God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but of his humane nature, habitually and actually. Hence the Apoſtle, <hi>He knew no ſinne,</hi> 1 Cor. 5. and he was made like unto us, <hi>ſinne only excepted, Heb.</hi> 4.15. Now here alſo the godly may rejoyce, for thoſe reliques and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders of ſinne are ſuch as prove thorns in the ſide of the godly: The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimentall ſenſe of this made <hi>Paul</hi> cry out, <hi>Oh miſerable man that I am</hi>! Well though in thee there be the ſtubs of ſinne, yet in Chriſt there are none, and now God dealeth not with us in our perſons, but as in Chriſt, being found in him, ſaith the Apoſtle, as the malefactour was in the City of refuge, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Chriſt finiſhed his work in reſpect of duration,</hi> for even the Law required continuance, though there were perfection of parts and degrees, and ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive perfection alſo, yet <hi>Curſed is he that doth not continue therein,</hi> Gal. 3.10. as you ſee <hi>Adam</hi> did not, but Chriſt from the beginning to the end of his daies held it out, yea his love did moſt appear at the later end, for then was the greateſt and hardeſt parts of his work to undergo, but though in all that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, contempt and ſcorn, yet he was not weary, he did not give over his work, he did not fail or faint in the later end: Thus Chriſt was our <hi>David</hi> fighting againſt <hi>Goliah,</hi> and in his conqueſt we did overcome.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, <hi>He ſo finiſhed it, that he hath left nothing to be done either by Angels or men, in that way and kinde as he did.</hi> Therefore all theſe doctrines that main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain free-will, that hold the mediation and interceſſion of Saints in heaven, that maintain merits and ſatisfactions, all theſe blaſpheam the ſufficiency of Chriſt, and ſay, Chriſt hath not finiſhed his work, for either Chriſt was a <hi>totall</hi> and <hi>perfect</hi> Mediator, or elſe a <hi>partiall</hi>; if a <hi>totall</hi> and <hi>perfect,</hi> then there
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:65216:77"/>
needeth no more, one Sun is ſufficient, all things added are ſuperfluous, if a partiall Mediatour, then he did not finiſh his work, then he did it by halves, and ſo Angels and Men are to ſhare with him in his glory; It's true they have many diſtinctions to mince the matter, but theſe fig-leaves cannot cover <hi>Adams</hi> nakedneſſe, and it's made the ſinful property of man fallen, <hi>to ſeek out many inventions; God made man upright, but they have ſought <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ut many inventions,</hi> Eccl. 7.29. They have many colours and pretences, many diſtinctions and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes to cover their ſins with; But you will ſay, <hi>If Chriſt hath done all,</hi>

               <hi>and we are to doe nothing, then what need we be diligent and zealous in the waies of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe?

               </note> For our duties are not required to that end which Chriſts was, but yet they are neceſſarily commanded for other ends; Though Chriſt did work and finiſh his work, yet thou muſt work and endeavour to finiſh thy work too; But how? It's good to underſtand this, for here Popery and the true Religion part, here they oppoſe one another: We pleade the neceſſity, the preſence, the command of good and holy works as well as they, only we differ in the end; They preſſe them for ſuch an end as Chriſt did his work for us, for merit, for juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for our ſalvation; This we ſay is to derogate from Chriſt; This is to make Chriſt of no effect, whoſoever repents, beleeveth, doth any holy duty for this end, is guilty of ſpiritual Idolatry, he maketh another Chriſt to himſelf, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the true Chriſt, but then there are other ends for which we do theſe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, partly becauſe God hath commanded them as the way to walk in, if ever we will be ſaved, ſo that though our holy life deſerve not heaven, yet our wicked and ungodly life deſerveth hell, and then partly to glorifie God, and to teſtifie our thankfulneſſe and love to him, yea, there is an inſeparable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion between a man intereſted in Chriſt and a holy life, as there is in the fire with heat and light.</p>

            <p n="1">1.

            <p>Let us conſider this briefly in Chriſt and then in our ſelves.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Concerning Chriſt,</hi> God had ſo ordained and appointed, That he ſhould firſt be eminent in doing and ſuffering, and then ſhould have a reward; It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoved him firſt to ſuffer <hi>and ſo to enter into glory,</hi> Luk. 24.26.<note place="margin">I. To Chriſt.</note> 
               <hi>Ought not Chriſt to have ſuffered theſe things?</hi> There was a debt and duty upon Chriſt to wear the Crown of thorns before he put on the Crown of glory; To be debaſed more
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:65216:79"/>
then all before he was exalted above all, ſo that the ſtipulation and agreement which the Father made with the Sonne, contained in it both duty to be done by Chriſt, and a reward to be vouchſafed to him; He was <hi>to drink of the brook,</hi> and ſo to lift up his head, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 110.7. This was the order that God had indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſably commanded, and nothing could hinder it, though all this was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing Chriſts willingneſſe to undergo the office of a Mediatour; for otherwiſe though he had become man, yet he might alwaies have kept up the manifeſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his divine glory, and hence it is that the Scripture ſaith, <hi>he ought to have ſuffered</hi>; There was a neceſſity from the juſtice of God which will puniſh ſinne in the offender or in the Surety, and he ought to do it, becauſe of his own faithfulneſſe and truſt, he ſhould not diſcharge that which had undertaken un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he became thus obedient.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The order that is between Chriſts work and reward</hi> is far different from ours, and of another nature, for that is an order of merit and cauſality, but ours on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of antecedency,<note place="margin">Glory the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of Chriſts merit.</note> and by a promiſe: Therefore when Chriſt looks for his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it's upon farre other grounds then when <hi>Paul</hi> expects his <hi>Crown of glory</hi>; for Chriſt looks for his glory upon his work, as a cauſe and a merit, it being fully perfect, and more then he was bound unto, if abſolutely conſidered, though when once he became our Surety it behoved him to perform all, ſo that Chriſt had his glory by the Title of juſtice and deſert, though in reſpect of the perſonal Union he had alwaies a right to all glory; But <hi>Paul</hi> and all the godly have it by meer grace and favour, for when the Children of God have done all they can, yet ſuch is their imperfection that they need a pardon, and ſo their ſalvation and glory is of meer grace; Therefore though there be a ſimilitude between Chriſts work and his glory, and ours, yet there is not an equality, The one is of juſtice and merit, the other of grace and favour; The more inexcuſable then are all theſe Popiſh doctrines that would puff up a man to ſuch a conceit of himſelf and Chriſt together, of his free-will and grace together<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not Chriſt and grace alone, that hence they will pleade their Title to heaven, Chriſts merits and their own.</p>

Salvation</hi>; Sluggiſhneſſe and lazineſſe will deprive of this glory; Oh when ſuch ſhall ſee themſelves ſhut out of all happineſſe and tormented for ever in thoſe eternal flames, then how will they cry out of their lukewarmneſſe and unprofitableneſſe? what a terrible ſentence is pronounced upon the unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Servant? <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.30. He is to be <hi>caſt into utter darkneſſe where there is weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and gnaſhing of teeth</hi>; If Chriſt himſelf muſt firſt work and then look for a reward, let not the Servant think to be above his Maſter, We muſt not think to have heavenly glory, as our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. The Lillies of the Field have a greater glory then of <hi>Solomons,</hi> yet they ſpin not, they labour not; No, but the Scripture crieth out aloud to every one, <hi>To work out his Salvation with fear and trembling,</hi> Phil. 2.12. Oh then that the conſideration that Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity is a work, No work no glory, would make us ſhake off ſlothfulneſſe and negligence; Do not think God will provide heaven for thee as he did a Wife for <hi>Adam,</hi> in a deep ſleep, he thought of nothing, he took no care about any ſuch thing: They that ſay, <hi>Let us eat and drink for to morrow we ſhall die,</hi> little think of the way and the work God requireth before happineſſe: Thoſe that like <hi>Dives fare deliciouſly every day,</hi> that live in eaſe and ſecurity, let them think this Calm will breed a great Storm, as they ſay, before Earthquakes, there is a wonderful ſtilneſſe and calmneſſe, So all their pleaſure, eaſe, and delight is but the forerunner of unſpeakable torments and miſery.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Hence we ſee, <hi>That good works and an holy active life is not forbidden but commanded by the Scripture</hi>; To preach Chriſt, or faith, or grace, or the benefit of the Sacraments ſo, as that a godly, exact, and diligent walking and working is excluded, is to preach another Chriſt, another Goſpel then we have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; Our Saviour by thoſe Parables of <hi>divers talents,</hi> as alſo of the <hi>fooliſh Virgins,</hi> and of the <hi>unjuſt ſteward,</hi> Mat. 25. of <hi>hiring Labourers</hi> into the Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, did hereby commend the neceſſity of working, <hi>Paul fought a good fight,</hi> and all the godly Worthies commended by him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. had an active labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous faith, and they are accounted <hi>bleſſed that die in the Lord</hi>: Why? becauſe <hi>their works follow them,</hi> Rev. 14.13. yea, at the day of judgement that judicial proceſſe will be according to the <hi>works we have done,</hi> or we have not done, for omiſſion of duties, though there be no commiſſion of ſinne, the ſentence of condemnation will be pronounced; ſo that concerning this duty of working there have been <hi>errours on both ſides,</hi> ſometimes Satan hath ſo prevailed as to perſwade men againſt working, to fancy a kinde of notional faith that will not purifie or clenſe the heart, a painted fire that will not burn: Sometimes again when he could not prevail that waies, then he hath ſet up working to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw beleeving to make Chriſt and his grace ineffectuall, Take we heed then that we ſplit not our ſelves at either of theſe rocks, but conform our ſelves to Chriſt, who was never idle, but like a careful Shepherd went up and down ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the loſt Sheep; This is the devils great temptation, to tempt thee not to work, or if thou workeſt to puff thee up with confidence about it, and ſo to make thee <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Indeed Gods glory is to be ſought in the firſt place, and then our glory; ſo that it's a ſhame, if in all our doings and ſufferings for God we are not full of joy, becauſe of that unſpeakable glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry apprehended by faith, Faith makes it preſent as if we already were partakers of it; So that whatſoever temptations and diſcouragements are in the work of the Lord, this glory will abundantly make amends for it; Are there reproaches and diſgrace in the world? All the while thou didſt ſin and the devils work, thou hadſt the love and good-will of the world, but ſince thou haſt betaken thy ſelf to the ſervice of God, thou art the ſcoff and reproach of all; O think of the glory God will crown thee with before all the world; Again, are all the works of God painful, difficult, and contrary to fleſh and bloud thou muſt ſtrive and wraſtle much in praier, be alwaies in a combat and conflict, Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber this everlaſting glory, yea, God therefore doth many times put his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren upon all exerciſes and ſad temptations, which make them ake at the very heart, and all is to encreaſe their glory the more; Thus <hi>Job,</hi> thus <hi>Paul,</hi> they had extraordinary trials that they might have extraordinary glory: Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more is there ſelf-denial required in Gods work? Muſt thou part with thy pleaſures, with thy profit, thy delights? ſtill remember, this glory will make thee no loſer, for alas what proportion is there between theſe petty things thou leaveſt, and thoſe everlaſting treaſures God hath provided for thee.</p>
            <p>In the ſixth place, <hi>That the glory of Gods people may be full, he giveth them time and large opportunities of working for him,</hi> and keeps thee in this world, not for any earthly and outward advancement of thy ſelf, but to ſerve him in thy gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, as it's ſaid, <hi>David ſerved God in his generation,</hi> Act. 13.36. and God calleth <hi>Moſes his ſervant</hi>; Whatſoever thy relation, thy place, thy office be, God hath appointed thee to work, and therefore he prolongs thy life till thy work be done; This is a comfortable conſideration which all the godly may take, that death ſhall not ſeize on them while thay have work to do for God, and when that is finiſhed then this ſummons to everlaſting glory. As for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants this Truth reacheth not to them, and if any like the Thief on the Croſſe are called at the laſt hour, and ſo are not able to work in the Vineyard, yet even ſuch have an habitual prepared heart for it, if they had the opportunity; But for others whoſe daies are prolonged they are thus to think with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, I have this day, this week, longer to adde to my work God hath for me to doe; Take heed of miſpent time, take heed of loſing daies and weeks, <hi>The night is coming when none can work.</hi>

How much comfort and joy the godly may take at the hour of death; Their work is done, now they have nothing but the Robes of glory to put on, That fulneſſe of glory they are immediatly to poſſeſſe ſhould ſwallow up the fears of death, and the love of the world; With what joy ſhould they cry out, Farewell Friends, Wife and Children, welcome God, welcome eternal glory: Alas, thou haſt no glory here, Thy body is a vile body, thy ſoul a ſinful ſoul, the world is the valley of death, an Hoſpitall of diſeaſed men, and therefore thou art to rejoice at this approaching glory; Hence it is that the righteous is ſaid to have hope in his death, to be bleſſed in his death, for all his old things paſſe away, a new place, new company, new happineſſe, new joy, but yet here are cautions to the godly dying man that hath done his work.</p>

            <p n="2">2. <hi>Therefore after all his works though it were Martyrdom it ſelf, he is to look for glory by vertue of Gods promiſe as a meer gift</hi>; Upon this tenure thou art to plead for it, <hi>The gift of God is eternal life,</hi> for though we had done all, yet God might deny us eternal life, Though we had perfectly done all our duty, yet God might annihilate us and there be at an end; Therefore it's wholly of his grace to make a promiſe of eternal life, for by this means though he be not a deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor to us, yet he is to himſelf, he is faithful and cannot deny his own words, and for this reaſon as it's called a gift, ſo ſometimes a reward, not as if there were any proportion between our work and this glory, but becauſe God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed this as a ſure conſequent upon doing what is well; Therefore <hi>Ambroſe</hi> diſtinguiſhed well of a reward, there is <hi>merces liberalitatis,</hi> as if an whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome ſhould be given a man for lifting up a ſtraw, and there it <hi>merces debiti,</hi> of debt and ſtrict juſtice, but that cannot be between the creature and the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, much leſſe the creature fallen and corrupted.</p>

            <p n="2">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. <hi>We are to conſider and attend to the order of our matter</hi>; That which is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary is to be preferred before what is convenient, only what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to Gods glory and our ſalvation is farre to be preferred before any tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall good thing, as we ſee by the direction in our Lords Praier, and by Chriſts command, <hi>Seek ye firſt the Kingdom of heaven,</hi> Mat. 6.33. It's diſputed whether temporall mercies may be praied for or no, it may ſeem a thing below the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Spirit of a Chriſtian, but if it be lawful then it's diſputed how far whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther abſolutely or conditionally only, and it's reſolved that becauſe temporal mercies are not promiſed by God abſolutely, nor are they abſolutely neceſſary to our ſalvation; Therefore we may pray only with ſubmiſſion and ſubordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if it be Gods will, and ſo farre as they may be a furtherance to our ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual good.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. <hi>There muſt be an attention to the words we uſe in our prayer as well as to the matter</hi>; That they be grave, decent and comely; That there be nothing of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, affectation, or irreverence; Praier is a worſhip of God; When <hi>Abraham</hi> was admitted to a diſcourſe with God, how greatly did he debaſe himſelf, he was but <hi>dust and aſhes,</hi> Gen. 18.27. and who was he that he ſhould ſpeak to God, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 5.2. There is a notable advice to look to our words when we have to do with God, <hi>He is in heaven and thou on earth</hi>: That is a vaſt diſtance and great diſproportion, <hi>Therefore let thy words be few</hi>: The wiſeman doth not there for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid a long praier, for he himſelf made a very long one at the Dedication of the Temple, and repeated this Petition very often, <hi>Then hear thou in heaven and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give, and heal this people,</hi> 1 Kin. 8. But that we ſhould look to our words that they be not idle, ſuperfluous and vain; a long praier in this ſence may be ſaid to have few words, when the matter is pithy, and the words pertinent, as he ſaid of a Book, <hi>Non ſunt longa,</hi> &amp;c. That is not a long Book from which you cannot well take away any thing, ſo that the length and ſhortneſſe of a praier lieth not ſo much in the quantity of time as in the matter; a praier held out for an hour without any ſavory matter or comely words is a long praier: Look we then to the matter in the firſt place, and then to words, but if we look to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards more then matter, and make an eloquent oration to God, rather then an humble ſupplication, this is ridiculous and ſinfull.</p>

            <p>Theſe things premiſed let us conſider,<note place="margin">When Repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the ſame matter in praier may be uſeful.</note> 
               <hi>When Repetitions or ingeminations of the ſame matter in Praier may be uſeful and neceſſary,</hi> and we ſhall ſpeak of ſuch a vocal Praier as is publique, wherein not only the Petitions but the edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of others is greatly to be reſpected, for this you muſt know, and it may ſerve for a fourth particular to preface this matter, That in publique praier wherein many joyn together, he that praieth is not only to attend to all the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned particulars, but to them that are aſſembled alſo, to conſider what Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions, what confeſſions are fit for them to be ſtirred up unto, and that is 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. The reaſon why the Apoſtle ſo much pleadeth againſt praier among other duties in an unknown tongue, becauſe <hi>it will not edifie thoſe that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned with us,</hi> and ſo ſome expound that, <hi>I will pray in the Spirit,</hi> that is for his own particular, and I will pray <hi>in the underſtanding alſo,</hi> that is in reſpect of others to advantage and benefit them, ſo that in our publique, whether as a Miniſter, as a Maſter of a Family, or otherwiſe; We muſt conſider the perſons with us what they need what things moſt concern them, and this is a particular way to affect them, it being here as with a Sermon, the cloſer it comes to the heart, the more good it doth, ſo with a praier the more any Petition cloſeth with another mans heart, the more it doth affect him and enlarge him, and therefore fit words and fit matter are eſpecially to be attended unto in ſuch publique praier, where not only ſupplication but edification is intended.</p>
            <p>Let us then conſider when the ground of repetition and ingemination is good.</p>

It's a great work to be a Miniſter, and it's a great work to be a private Chriſtian, for every one is bound to be much in Praier, and yet how many requiſites go to this? Oh therefore that we could awaken three ſorts of men by this: 1. The ignorant man that hath his praiers but without any under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, any affection, and therefore praieth while he is doing other work, or ſluggiſhly in his bed, yea, he knoweth not whether it be a praier or not, only he is told ſo, and therefore they think the Creed and the Commandements a Praier; Miſerable blinde people, what will become of them! 2.

            <p>WE are treating on the <hi>Petition</hi> it ſelf, and whereas we ſee our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our praying for that which was appointed and promiſed before the Petition for it, we may obſerve,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That even thoſe things God hath promiſed and decreed to give to his people,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Doct.</hi> Things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed muſt be praied for.</note> 
               <hi>muſt yet be accompliſhed to them praying for it</hi>; Gods purpoſes and promiſes require our Supplications; This is the order God hath appointed, Ask and ye ſhall have, ſeek and ye ſhall finde, knock and it ſhall be opened to you, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. Thus when God had promiſed he would do ſuch and ſuch things for his Church by his Prophet, he addeth, Nevertheleſſe <hi>he would be ſought unto by the Houſe of Iſrael for thoſe things,</hi> Ezek. 33.33.</p>
            <p>There is much conſiderable matter in this Doctrine, and therefore it needs the more diligent explication:</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> As 1. <hi>There have been two contrary errours about Praier</hi>; Some have look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon it as neceſſary and ſtrictly commanded that they thought we might do nothing but pray; That we were to caſt off all other employments and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take our ſelves to that duty only; They were called the <hi>Euchetae,</hi> they were deluded from the miſtaking of theſe places, <hi>Pray alwaies</hi> and <hi>Pray without ceaſing</hi>: Others have runne into a contrary extremity, making praier altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther uſeleſſe and unneceſſary, and that becauſe all things came about in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitable and fatal manner, as they ſay, and therefore praier doth no good at all, but the ſeverall commands of this duty, do ſhew the impiety of that opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; The <hi>Socinians</hi> though they grant men did pray in the Old Teſtament, yet they ſay there was no command for it till the Goſpel-diſpenſation; They ſay, Chriſt required it as a new duty, it not being a duty before, but this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo is falſe; For doth not the Old Teſtament ſay, Call upon me in the day of trouble, I will hear thee, and thou ſhalt glorifie me, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 50.15. So that to pray is not an indifferent or arbitrary thing, Neither may it be judged uſeleſſe but of great power and prevalency.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> 2. <hi>It cannot be denied but that if a man ſhould pray with theſe thoughts, that he ſhould change Gods minde, and make him alter his will, ſuch a man hath falſe and ſinful thoughts of God</hi>; and yet how many are plunged into ſuch falſhoods; They conceive they have to do with God, as with a man who is mutable, and therefore by entreaties and importunities we make him change his reſolutions, and do thoſe things he never purpoſed to do, as we ſee in the importunate Widow with the unjuſt Judge; If therefore thou in thy Praiers to God ſhould go with theſe thoughts, as if by thy praiers thou couldſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:65216:85"/>
God to will that at the preſent which he did not will before from all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity; or that when he had purpoſed one thing, by thy praiers he ſhould be perſwaded to do another thing; In this caſe thou haſt ſinful and diſhonourable thoughts of God; Thou thinkeſt of him as a man like thy own ſelf, and the ground why ſuch apprehenſions are ungodly and unbeſeeming the Majeſty of God, is becauſe he is immutable and unchangeable in his nature: There is no ground of change or alteration in him, becauſe there is no ignorance in his underſtanding, he foreknoweth all things, no mutability in hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> will, therefore thy praiers though they are neceſſary and uſefull, yet they have no ſuch influence upon God as to change his minde, or to make him of unwilling, willing.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> 3. <hi>There are ſome things ſo abſolutely promiſed that do not ſuppoſe any conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Praier on our parts</hi>; As the initiall workings of grace, The beginning<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of our converſion, eſpecially that promiſe, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12, that <hi>God will pour on us the Spirit of praier and ſupplication</hi>; The fullfilling of this promiſe cannot be by way of praier, for it's a promiſe to enable us to pray, and ſo we could not make it ſelf to be a condition for it ſelf; Indeed we may pray for the Spirit of praier, but that is to be underſtood in regard of a further meaſure of this Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; As we may exerciſe Faith in the promiſe for a further degree of Faith, we may beleeve that God thereby may encreaſe our faith, and make it more ſtrong: Thus the promiſe of ſending Chriſt into the world, and giving him to be a Saviour to his people, doth not ſuppoſe our praier, but rather praier is a gift from this; We therefore pray <hi>viz.</hi> acceptably, becauſe we are united to Chriſt, and have his Spirit dwelling in us: Thus God alſo in the converſion of his people cometh in with his grace upon them, before they deſire or ſeek after him, at leaſt in a right manner, <hi>I was found of thoſe that ſought me not,</hi> ſaid Chriſt, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65.1. Therefore this is not to be underſtood univerſally of every good thing that God hath promſed, but for the moſt part of thoſe things which do ſuppoſe us already godly, and put into a capacity and ſpirituall ability of praier, Then God will not do for us, till we ſeek unto him: As the Mother doth not expect the childe that cannot yet ſpeak, ſhould ask for ſuch a thing at her hands.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV,"/> 5. <hi>God hath required Praier as a conſtant duty to be performed by all, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding any purpoſes or promiſes made by him</hi>; I ſay as a conſtant duty required of all, and therefore that is an unjuſtifiable poſition of ſome, That it's not lawfull, or a duty, for wicked men to pray: But when our Saviour ſpeaks ſo univerſally <hi>Ask and ye ſhall have,</hi> and Gods wrath is to be poured upon the Families of the earth, becauſe they call not upon God; It's plain, it's their ſin, that they do not pray, and although God will not hear the Praier of ſinners, but it's an abomination to God, yet for all that it's their duty to pray, not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to pray ſinfully, not to keep up their ſins and their praiers together, but to empty themſelves of their poiſon, to lay aſide their ſuperfluity of naughti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and ſo to come with pure hearts and pure hands to God, as <hi>David, I will waſh my hands in innocency, ſo will I compaſſe thy Altar,</hi> Pſa. 26.6. It's there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a duty enjoyned all and that indiſpenſably to pray unto God; Again I ſay, It's a conſtant duty required of all, not as if there were to be no intermiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, but when the time and ſeaſon doth require it, as they are called con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Sacrifices, which were offered every day, though not all the day long, and this overthroweth that opinion of ſome who think it no duty to pray, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe when they feel ſome motion or impulſe of the Spirit of God upon them, ſo that if they are a day, a moneth, a year without this, they will not pray; This is not according to the Rule: Again it's a conſtant duty required of all, Therefore it's a preſumptuous conceit of thoſe who apprehend themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Petitions; They will do nothing but ſing praiſes to God, and give him
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:65216:85"/>
thanks, as if they were Angels in heaven, but as for Petitions and Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons they are ſo perfect they are above them, Why do not ſuch men refuſe to eat and drink, ſaying, they have ſuch perfect bodies they need no ſuſtenance? Doth not Chriſt himſelf here importunately and fervently put up his Petitions to the Father?</p>
            <p n="5">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/> 5. <hi>Though God will not perform the good things he promiſeth without our praiers, yet our Praiers are not meritorious</hi>; They deſerve not at Gods hand: Though we cannot have the promiſed bleſſing without Praier, yet not for our Praier; Therefore it's not only arrogant but an irrationall doctrine in Popery, to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert Praier to be a meritorious work. Doth the beggar deſerve an alms, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he asketh? Who would not rather ſay that praier is a plain profeſſion of our beggery, emptineſſe, and utter impotency; Thereby we proclaim that of our ſelves, we are not able to procure the leaſt mercy; Therefore when we come to God, take heed of truſting in Praier, of idolizing thy duties, It's a ſin we are prone too, but as they ſay of clothes, Pride of them is an extreme vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, becauſe the very putting them on ſhould put us in minde of our ſin that made nakedneſſe a ſhame, ſo our very praier ſhould make us abhorre our ſelves and ſet up God as the only fountain of all hope and comfort, if we could help our ſelves why pray we to him?</p>
            <p n="6">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VI"/> 6. <hi>Therefore it's diſputed whether God doth require Praier for the mercies ſake. or give the mercy for Praiers ſake</hi>; As for example God hath promiſed encreaſe of grace, ſanctification of all afflictions, if we rightly pray to him; Now the Queſtion is whether he giveth this mercy for praier ſake, or not rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he will give ſuch a mercy, therefore he enableth us to pray, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly this latter way is the truth, God gives us not the mercy becauſe we pray, but becauſe he will vouchſafe ſuch a mercy, therefore he quickneth us up to pray; The mercy is not referred to praier, but praier to the mercy.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VII"/> Therefore 7. <hi>As long as God keeps up our heart in a praying way ſo long there is hope of the accompliſhment of the mercy we pray for: Thou prepareſt the heart and heareſt with the ear,</hi> ſaith <hi>David,</hi> Pſa. 10.17. Not but that in ſome temporal mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies the ſoul may be kept long in a praying waiting frame, and yet the mercy it ſelf be never given us, but then it will be with us as with <hi>Paul, My grace is ſufficient for thee,</hi> 2 Cor. 12. So that ſtill God is good to thee though thou haſt not that thou praieſt for, if a praying frame of heart be on thee; on the other ſide, it's an heavy defection not to be able or willing to pray: I ſpeak not of a tempted Chriſtian, who praieth even while he ſaith he doth not, he cannot pray, but of thoſe who by their ſins have made themſelves as a barren Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and the heavens like braſſe.</p>
            <p>In the next place let us conſider why God who hath purpoſed and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to do ſuch things,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Reaſons.</hi>
               </note> yet requireth our praiers for the accompliſhment of them.</p>
            <p>And the firſt may be generall from <hi>the goodneſſe of God who loveth to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate himſelf,<note place="margin">I. Generall and common.</note> and therefore though he could do all things without ſecond cauſes and means, yet he is pleaſed to uſe them, not from indigence but indulgence</hi>; So that as we ſee in all natural effects that are produced, God doth not thoſe things im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly himſelf but hath ſecond cauſes and means whereby they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated, So it is here; God in the wonderfull things he hath predeſtinated or promiſed for his people, hath appointed means for the performance of them; Hence as he converts by the Word, ſo he beſtoweth his mercy upon a praying people; This reaſon is common with all other his works in the world,<note place="margin">II. More proper and peculiar Reaſons.</note> but then the more proper and peculiar Reaſons for praier are,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. <hi>God will be ſought to becauſe hereby he is acknowledged the authour and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of all the good we have</hi>; Did we not pray, were we not commanded to come to him, it might be doubted whether he was the cauſe of the good things
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:65216:86"/>
we deſire, and this is the reaſon why we may not pray to Angels or Saints, but God only, becauſe he alone and none elſe is the Authour of all good things, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. <hi>From him cometh every good and perfect gift,</hi> So that if we take praier away, we do in effect take God away; He that liveth without praier, liveth as if there were no God, as if all things came by a natural neceſſity or uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain chance, and not from a wiſe God, ſo that to pray is to give a ſolemn Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony unto the world, that we beleeve there is a God who governeth in the world, with whom are the treaſures of all good things, and that there is not the leaſt mercy we want we can have a ſupply of, but from him; That as the Scripture ſaith he hath the Key of the Heavens, <hi>he ſhutteth and no man can o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen,</hi> ſo he keeps the Key of all other mercies, No wonder then that though God will give us good things, yet we muſt earneſtly pray for them, for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe God would not be owned, there would not that glory be given to him as is due.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. <hi>As God hath appointed this for his honour, ſo likewiſe for our honour, that we may be admitted into his preſence, and have holy Communion with him</hi>; It's the greateſt honour that we are capable of, that we are allowed at all times to make our requeſts known to him, For Praier is an heavenly commerce with God, God and man cannot meet together unleſſe they be agreed, how can the conſuming fire and ſtubble be near one another? Might not God ſay to all, which he doth to ſome, <hi>What haſt thou to do to take my words into thy mouth?</hi> Pſal. 50. As Chriſt rebuked the devils, and would not own their confeſſion of him though it was true, ſo might God abhorre our Petitions, and account it a diſhonour for us to come near him, yea, and that though we had no ſinne, becauſe we are but finite creatures, and ſo not able to do any thing ſutably to his great Majeſty: Oh then let us not look upon a praier as a burthen, as a task, farre be it from us to be haled and pulled to it, when any ſuch liſtliſneſſe and unwillingneſſe is on thee, Oh conſider can there be more glory and honour put on me? Did <hi>Haman</hi> grudge to come in <hi>Ahaſhuerus</hi> his preſence, and to the Royall Banquet? Did he not rather glory of it to his Wife and Friends?</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>JOH. 17.5.</bibl>
               <q>And now O Father glorifie thou me with thy own ſelf, with the glory which I had with thee before the world was.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THE next thing in order to be purſued is the <hi>nature of that glory which Chriſt praied for</hi>; For Chriſt being near the bittereſt part of his Croſs, and ſeeing nothing but gall for him to drink, he comforteth and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courageth himſelf with that glory which is provided for him, and this makes him ſo earneſt in praier for it, where by the way we may ſee <hi>the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogant preſumption of thoſe who hold they are above Praier</hi>; They will give thanks to God as Angels do, but their perfection is ſuch that they need not preſent Petitions in Praier, what a Diabolical deluſion is this, for Chriſt himſelf though he confeſſed no ſinne in Praier, <hi>yet was not above Petitions,</hi> as we ſee in this Chapter, and if it were granted, which cannot be that they were ſo pure as to be without ſinne, yet they have not as yet glorified bodies, and therefore for that glory in heaven they ought to pray, but why do we meddle with theſe who indeed need praier moſt, and that to ſee themſelves deluded, and to be in a farre more dangerous eſtate, then many other perſons.</p>
            <p>We come 1. to the <hi>deſcription</hi> of this glory praied for from the <hi>nature</hi> or <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent</hi> property of it; It's a glory with Gods own ſelf, <hi>Glorifie me with thy own ſelf</hi>; This as you heard is ſpoken partly oppoſitely to humane glory and the honour of the world, for as Chriſt deſpiſed the ſhame, and was not troubled at the reproach he had in the world, ſo neither was he lifted up with the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and honour he had here, and then partly in reference to his work done on earth, for on earth he did his work, in heaven he expects his reward.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not handle this peculiarly as it relates to Chriſt, but take in all the Children of God, for herein Chriſt and all his members are alike: In the midſt of their afflictions and trials they are to ſupport themſelves with hope,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Obſerv.</hi> That all Gods people are ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly to pray for their glory above all earthly glory.</note> and pour forth earneſt praiers, for the glory God hath prepared for them; So that the Obſervation is,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That all the Children of God like Chriſt himſelf are earneſtly to pray for their glory with God, above all earthly honour or glory</hi>; Chriſt praied not with ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:65216:88"/>
as the godly do, as is in time more largely to be ſhewed, only both he and the godly agree in the matter praied for <hi>viz.</hi> glory in the generall, though Chriſts glory is not of the ſame nature with theirs; This glory is the center in which the ſeveral lines of their deſires and praiers are to meet; This ſhould be the cordiall in all their temptations and exerciſes; though poor here, though miſerable here, though deſpiſed here, yet my eye is faſtened upon the glory hereafter, oh that our Auditors were ſo ſpirituall as to be affected with this eternal Crown of glory, for none but the heavenly and truly godly man can deſire to hear of this; The other ſort of men had rather have their bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-corn then this Pearl; Their Garlick then this Manna, Their husks then this fatted Calf.</p>
            <p>But to open this Doctrine, there are three particulars implied in it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The nature of this glory.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It's earneſtly to be praied for.</p>

            <p>
               <note place="margin">I. The nature of this glory, <hi>viz.</hi> with God himſelf, which implies,</note>But of the firſt The nature of this glory, and that is expreſſed firſt in the Text, <hi>a glory with Gods own ſelf,</hi> and that doth imply theſe particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That it is a glory in the hand of God,</hi> to diſpoſe and give to him whom he pleaſeth; You ſee Chriſt himſelf beggeth for this at Gods hand: None can violently invade this glory or break into thoſe heavenly manſions whether God will or no, all heavenly glory is with God, who is therefore called the <hi>God of glory,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. It is in the hands of God.</note> or glorious; not only becauſe he is glorious in himſelf, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is the bountifull authour and diſpenſer of all glory, as the Sunne is the Fountain of all light, ſo then it's not in the power of any earthly Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate to make men thus glorious; Though <hi>Ahaſhuerus</hi> could make <hi>Haman</hi> and <hi>Mordecai</hi> outwardly glorious, yet for this heavenly glory the greateſt powers of the world need it from God as well as the pooreſt beggar.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <note place="margin">2. God is the object of this glory.</note>2. <hi>It is a glory with God, becauſe he is the object of this glory</hi>; In him it is that we have all our happineſſe and glory; Even in this life we are forbidden to glory in riches, in honours and greatneſſe, <hi>but let him that glorieth, glory in this, that he knoweth God,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.31. and then much more in heaven, it is our glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that we enjoy God; So that all the happineſſe, excellency and glory which is ſaid to be in heaven is reductively in this, that we are made partakers of God, with God, and in God is only glory, and ſeeing that glory and our ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt happineſſe are all one in this Point, of what great concernment is it, for every one to conſider, what that is in which he placeth his happineſſe; Doſt thou not think thy ſelf happy, if thou haſt the good things and the great things of this world? Art thou not of the Serpents breed and not the womans ſeed, in that thou lickeſt up the duſt of the earth? It is that that all men miſcarry in; They do not conſider what that is which if obtained would make a man happy; Whereas the Scripture is plain and clear informing that it is in having God for our God; and then not only happy here but happy hereafter.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <note place="margin">3. It's a glory which God li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveth of.</note>3. In that this glory is ſaid to be with God, it implieth, that <hi>it is ſuch which God approveth of, and liketh off</hi>; It's not an appearance of glory, but true reall glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; The Hebrew word <hi>Canod</hi> for glory ſignifieth weight; As the Apoſtle di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſheth between Circumciſion of the Letter and the Spirit, which latter he ſaith hath its praiſe of God and not of men, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. ult. That is, glorious be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, ſo the glory in heaven hath its praiſe from God: What will it avail to affect glory and praiſe from men, when God will abhorre and diſhonour, will deſpiſe and curſe thee; <hi>That which is highly eſteemed amongſt men, is abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable before God,</hi> Luk. 18.

heart, Oh then again and again ſay, Is this glory ſuch as God accounts of? Doth the Lord ſay this is happineſſe that I have? The rich man bid his ſoul take his eaſe, but did God bid him do ſo alſo?</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>This phraſe doth imply the glory that is in heaven, as oppoſitely to the work we do on earth</hi>; This is that all the Children of God ſhould look after,<note place="margin">4. Oppoſite to earthly glory.</note> a glory in heaven; This made them <hi>long for</hi> and <hi>haſten the coming of Chriſt,</hi> this made them judge themſelves but Pilgrims here, and ſo to ſeek out for a better City; Take we heed then that we be not in the Number of thoſe <hi>who minde earthly things,</hi> that judge nothing glorious but what ſeems in this world full of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and admiration, The ſtate of men living here is a condition of miſery and calamity, which made <hi>Job</hi> ſay <hi>that man who is born of a woman is born for ſorrow, as the ſparks fly upwards,</hi> Job 5.7. So that we may ſay God makes this life ſo bitter, that the glory in heaven may be ſweeter; Therefore he keeps us a while in this wilderneſſe, that <hi>Canaan</hi> may be the more prized.</p>
            <p>This is the nature of this glory as implied in that phraſe, <hi>with thy own ſelf</hi>;<note place="margin">More proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of this glory.</note> but there are other properties of it alſo, that may raiſe our expectations after it. As</p>

The ſecond thing is faith, and herein the godly themſelves are greatly to be blamed; They do not often in private Meditation and by faith inflame their hearts with the thoughts of glory: No wonder if they be ſo ready to faint and ſwoon under diſtreſſes; They have not this water of life to drink of, They think, They ſpeak, They are affected, as if all their hopes were in this life only; Oh what a ſhame is it that when the earthly man can day and night comfort himſelf in his great treaſures and abundance of wealth, that this eternal glory ſhould not raiſe thee up, There is nothing will make thee a Chriſtian of an excellent and heroical Spirit, but faith about this eternal glory; Shall the thoughts of a Crown, or of a great Inheritance keep up the heart of worldly men, and ſhall not the thoughts of eternal glory keep thee from ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the waters of affliction?</p>

It's ſo full that the heart of man cannot ſpeak or conceive about it; As humane glory is compared to all the empty things that are vapors and bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and a meer breath, a ſhadow without any ſubſtance: So this glory in heaven is a maſſie weighty glory, it hath all fulneſſe in it, There is fulneſſe of holineſſe, We are made pure and without the leaſt ſpot, There is fulneſſe of peace and joy, The Sea is not fuller of waters then their hearts and ſouls of eternal comforts; There is fulneſſe of all thy deſires and expectations; Here we have the dropſie diſpoſition, we have and ſtill we ask, yea, we can ſit down and fancy golden Mountains; Oh what compleat conditions and happineſſe may men in their thoughts make to themſelves, and their thoughts are wide, but the matter is nothing at all, but here this glory is above our thoughts, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove our deſires, above our wiſhes, we cannot deſire better then what we have.</p>
            <p>The ſecond part implied in the Doctrine, is, <hi>That this glory is to be earneſtly praied for by the Children of God.</hi>

               <note place="margin">II. The ſecond part of the Point is, that this glory is to be earneſtly praied for, For</note>Firſt, <hi>Becauſe</hi> as you heard <hi>God will not vouchſafe this mercy but to a praying people,</hi> Rom. 2. <hi>To thoſe that ſeek for immortality and honour</hi>; Hence this is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to in that Petition, <hi>Thy Kingdom come,</hi> and certainly if Chriſt himſelf who was thus unqueſtionably aſſured of this glory, and had merited it at Gods hands, doth yet pray for it, how much more ought we to have it ſolely of meer grace; Some have put it as a doubt whether it be not a mercenary diſpoſition too unworthy the childe of God,<note place="margin">1. Without ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God will not beſtow it.</note> to pray for glory; Yea, it's diſputed by Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts againſt Proteſtants, that it's lawful in all our godly actions to have an eye to this reward of glory, but they fight with a ſhadow; The Proteſtants do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it not only lawfull but a duty to ſeek after and pray for this crown of glory, only we ſay, The love to Gods glory ſhould be preferred before ours; We are to deſire his glory principally, and our ſalvation as ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate; Oh then let the prophane and wicked men of the world tremble at their death, when their night approacheth, for how canſt thou look for glory who never didſt pray for it? how canſt thou think to be partaker of it who waſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver much in ſeeking after it?</p>

            <p n="3">
               <note place="margin">3.</note>3. <hi>By earneſt praying for it our hope of it is much ſtrengthened and confirmed</hi>; Now a divine hope of this glory is rhat which makes us bear all afflictions, endure all chaſtiſements; This is the Oyl to keep our Lamps up, It's the anchor to the Ship, It's that only which keeps the heart from breaking: The Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture cals it <hi>the lively hope,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.3. all worldly hopes are dead and fading, but this hope is in the power and promiſe of God; Now there is no way to blow up theſe ſparks of hope into a flame ſo much as by praier, for praier if rightly diſcharged being <hi>a praier of faith,</hi> it muſt needs beget a lively hope; Oh then that we had this hope of eternal glory reigning in us more; Thou haſt carnal hope, worldly hope, all the day long is ſpent in hoping after ſome earthly comfort or other, but this divine hope is a ſtranger to thee.</p>

but Stars; In praying for glory thou praieſt for all things together in one, this one word <hi>glory</hi> hath every thing in it, to ſay <hi>Lord glorifie me</hi> there is all things comprehended in it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>This is the moſt ſutable mercy to a gracious and ſpirituall heart</hi>; To be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified is to be put out of a ſtate of ſinne into pure and perfect holineſſe,<note place="margin">2.

If the Church praied ſo earneſtly, <hi>Let him kiſſe me with the kiſſes of his mouth,</hi> Cant. 1. What then would the total and full enjoyment of God be, never to be divided or ſeparated more? Glory is not only the advantage and welfare of a godly man, the preſervation of him from hell and miſery, or giving him happineſſe, but it is the ordering of him with all graces more glorious then the Sunne; Hence the godly are compared to the Sunne and Starres in the Firmament, for the great luſtre God puts on them.</p>

Can a cold man warm himſelf at a painted fire? Could theſe birds fill themſelves that fled to <hi>Zeuxes</hi> painted grapes, taking them for true ones, no more can any thing in this world ſatisfie man; No, it's only in the world to come that can fill up every corner of the ſoul.</p>

               <hi>becauſe the way to heaven is full of briars and thorns</hi>; Great are the afflictions and tribulations which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide all that go in this way to glory; Were it not then that the heart is full of hopes in this matter, it would ſoon be diſcouraged, it would preſently give over, ſaying, Why ſhould I deny ſuch pleaſures and comforts as others take; Do I not wrong my ſelf? Am I not a defrauder of my own comforts? No; ſaith this hope of eternal glory, hold thy tongue from all grudgings and repi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings; There is glory coming will make amends for all, Heaven in reverſion is better then all the world in actual poſſeſſion, know then if at any time thy ſoul be dejected or caſt down within thee, if at any time thou art impatient and diſcontented; It's becauſe this hope of glory doth not fill the heart</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>WE are now arrived to the laſt clauſe in this Verſe, which containeth a ſecond deſcription of the glory Chriſt praied for, <hi>viz.</hi> From the <hi>externall efficiency of it,</hi> it was a glory provided for him before the world was. So that in this deſcription there are two Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That the world had a beginning</hi>; It was not as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and other Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers thought <hi>ab aeterno</hi>: This is to be handled in its time.</p>
            <p>The other Propoſition is,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That Chriſt had the glory he praied for with the Father before the world was.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Obſerv.</hi> That Chriſt had the glory he praied for with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before the world was.</note> Of this at this time.</p>
            <p>In the Greek it is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, not in a Grammatical conſtruction, for it is <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>that glory which I had</hi>; as alſo there is a trajection of <gap reason="foreign">

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, So in the Original; But our Tranſlators do well interpoſe it, where the ſence is to be made up; Now as was hinted the great doubt is, <hi>In what ſence Chriſt is ſaid to have this glory with the Father be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the world was</hi>: The <hi>Arians</hi> and <hi>Socinians</hi> who deny the eternal Deity of Chriſt, do moſt readily interpret it of Gods decree, and his inward purpoſe of minde, as if the meaning were, that the Father would glorifie him with that glory which God the Father had decreed for him before the world was, and it cannot be denied but that ſometimes a thing is ſaid to be before the world was, becauſe it was in Gods purpoſe: Thus <hi>Rev.</hi> 7. Chriſt is ſaid to be a <hi>Lamb ſlain from the beginning of the world,</hi> So 2 Tim. 1.9. <hi>The grace of God is ſaid to be given us in Jeſus Chriſt before the world began,</hi> that is, in reſpect of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, Thus ſome expound that phraſe ſo often uſed in this Chapter (<hi>Thoſe thou haſt given me) viz.</hi> in his decree. Hence it is that ſome Divines though Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox and fully beleeving the eternal Deity of Chriſt, do make this the ſence of
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:65216:91"/>
it, and indeed when we have other places that do fully aſſert a divine doctrine, we need not be vehement to force every Text to ſpeak it alſo; Becauſe <hi>Calvin</hi> did not approve of every Text that was uſually brought to prove the Trinity, though he vindicated thoſe that were clear and pregnant againſt the Anti-Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitarians, <hi>Hunnius</hi> a Lutheran wrote a Book calling i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> 
               <hi>Calvinus Judaizans,</hi> as if he turned Jew; Whereas indeed none do more wrong divine Truth then thoſe that will heap Texts of Scripture, which yet do not fully prove the thing que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned, and truly why we muſt in part at leaſt explain this of Gods purpoſe and decree, this is a ſtrong reaſon, becauſe Chriſt here praieth for his Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory glory, which was given him by God upon the performance of his Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torſhip, <hi>viz.</hi> to be exalted above all Principalities as head of his Church; Now this Mediatory glory he had not with God before the world was, unleſſe in Gods purpoſe, ſo that I ſay this muſt needs be part of the ſenſe: But in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond place Chriſt doth not only pray for his Mediatory glory but his divine glory in reſpect of the manifeſtation of it, <hi>viz.</hi> that now it might be diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to all the world, that he was not only man but <hi>God alſo, eternal, bleſſed for evermore,</hi> and in this ſence the Text doth ſtrongly maintain the <hi>Eternal Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Chriſt,</hi> for he praieth for the manifeſtation of that divine and eſſentiall glory he had with the Father before the world was; Inſomuch that Chriſt being in the Text ſaid to have this <hi>before the world was,</hi> it doth ſuppoſe a ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of his divine nature, for although the Scripture ſaith, the godly are E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected before the foundation of the world, yet it never ſaith, they had this <hi>before the world was,</hi> for that would ſuppoſe them to be exiſtent in nature, So that if the Text had ſaid no more then <hi>Glorifie me with the glory prepared for me before the world was,</hi> as it ſpeaks of the godly, then it would not have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſtrongly againſt thoſe hereticks; But when he ſaith, <hi>Which I had with thee,</hi> This doth neceſſarily ſuppoſe ſuch a thing as cannot be communicated to a meer creature; None but one eternal can ſay ſo. So that both theſe Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may go on as parts to make the compleat ſence of the Text, and this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main a thunderbolt againſt the Arians; Take we then the firſt particular as it ſuppoſeth the Eternity of Chriſt, <hi>That Chriſt had a being before he was born of the Virgin Mary, even a divine being as a God</hi>: No creature can ſay as Chriſt here<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> They have ſuch a glory with God before the world was, for it would be a contradiction to any creature to ſay ſo, for it would imply him to have a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before he hath a being: Hence the godly though they are ſaid to be elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and predeſtinated from Eternity, yet that doth not ſuppoſe them to be <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aeterno,</hi> becauſe <hi>Predeſtinatio ect actio immanens,</hi> and <hi>nihil ponit in eſſe</hi>; It's a meer immanent action in God, and puts no reall thing in the creature: Now that Chriſt had an Eternal being is plain; Beſides thoſe Texts of Scripture, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. where the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in the Wilderneſſe are ſaid to tempt Chriſt, and <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. <hi>Moſes</hi> in his daies <hi>accounted the reproach of Chriſt above the Treaſures of Egipt</hi>: And 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.11.

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Argum. </seg>3</label> 3. <hi>There are plain Texts of Scripture which inform us of the eternal being of Chriſt,</hi> as <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.55. <hi>Before Abraham was I am</hi>; What man could ſay ſo, I do not ſay, <hi>Before Abraham was, I was,</hi> for ſo every Angel might ſay, but <hi>I am,</hi> to ſignifie there is no ſucceſſion or difference of time in his being as he was God, It's an alluſion to that name God takes to himſelf when he bid <hi>Moſes</hi> ſay, <hi>I AM hath ſent thee,</hi> Exo. 3.14. and this is the more fully confirmed, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.7. where Chriſt is ſaid to be <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> the beginning and the end, who is, and was, and is to come; That very attribute which <hi>v.</hi> 3. is given to God the Father, is here given to God the Sonne, called alſo omnipotent, who would think any ſhould be ſo wilfully blinde as not to ſee light out of this Text.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> Secondly, <hi>Conſider in that Chriſt was thus God from all Eternity,</hi> when he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came man, he did not ceaſe to be God, for although the Scripture ſaith, <hi>Phi.</hi> 2. <hi>That he humbled himſelf,</hi> and emptied himſelf, yet it doth not ſay he ceaſed to be God, even in the midſt of all his Infirmities, and therefore Chriſts bloud is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>the bloud of God,</hi> Act. 25. not that he ſuffered in his divine nature, but that he who ſuffered in his humane nature was alſo God, and it's no wonder he did not ceaſe to be God, for it's impoſſible that God ſhould ceaſe to be God, all creatures if they are not <hi>corruptible,</hi> yet they are <hi>annihilable,</hi> if they have no principle of diſſolution, yet they have ſtronger power without, that is able to turn them into nothing: Therefore God alone is ſaid to have <hi>Immortality,</hi> 1 Tim 6.15. So then he doth not pray for glory, as if he had loſt it, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the outward manifeſtation of it was ſuppreſſed for a time, and therefore it is that he now praieth the Cloud may be withdrawn, that ſo the Sun may appear in its full glory.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> Thirdly, <hi>In that Chriſt had an eternal being it's plain that even before his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carntion, he did many things tending to the Reconciliation of his people</hi>; It's true indeed he is a Mediatour in reſpect of both his Natures, and it's clear he could not make propitiation for our ſins by his bloud, till he was made man, he could not be as a Prieſt to his Church, but then even before his Incarnation, he might be as a Prophet and a King to his people; As a Prophet revealing Gods will, and inſpiring the Prophets of the Old Teſtament, yea, It's maintained by the learned that he was <hi>the Angel,</hi> that guided the Church of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and therefore the people in the Wilderneſſe are ſaid to tempt Chriſt, as was ſaid; So as a King (though not incarnated) he might govern ſpiritually.</p>
            <p>Becauſe this is not the intended Subject I come to what Uſes may be made of it. Is Chriſt thus of an Eternal being,<note place="margin">

            </epigraph>
            <p>WE come to the laſt particular obſervable in the Text, <hi>Before the world began.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here is briefly laid down that poſition which the great and wiſe Philoſophers of the world did boldly gainſay, for it tels us, <hi>This great <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe had a beginning, The world was not from Eternity</hi>; This Truth will tend much to particular Edification, for I ſhall not handle it in a meer ſpeculative and metaphyſicall way, as ſome Philoſophers doe, while they debate this Point.</p>
            <p>Obſ. <hi>That the world was not from Eternity, but had its beginning in time</hi>; The Sun and Stars though ſuch glorious creatures, yet began to be in time, yea,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Obſerv.</hi> That the world was not from Eternity.</note> thoſe glorious Angels, which have no principle of corruption within them, they were alſo made in time, although it was the general opinion of moſt of the Ancients, that the Angels were made long before this viſible and corporeal world, but that is not ſo conſonant to Scripture.</p>
            <p>For the proof of this Point we might alledge the firſt Chapter of <hi>Geneſis,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Proved from Scripture.</note> where there is not only a relation of the worlds Creation, but an exact deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of the manner how, and alſo all the effects of this Creation, ſo that that Chapter hath more divinity and philoſophy in it then all the books of the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt Heathens put together, and indeed whatſoever the Heathens have of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity they have it from <hi>Moſes,</hi> though they have added thereunto many fooliſh Fables; I ſhall adde one pregnant Text to confirm this, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.3. where the Apoſtle intending to commend faith in all the ſeveral effects of it, begins with this as the foundation, <hi>By faith we underſtand the worlds were made</hi>; There is much ſpoken by the Apoſtle in few words, 1. He ſaith, <hi>By faith we underſtand</hi> the world was made, for howſoever ſome Philoſophers held the world was not from Eternity, yet thoſe that did hold it was made, did groſly and fooliſhly miſtake about the manner of it, and though by true Philoſophy we may prove the world could not be from Eternity, yet the Word of God affirming this is the beſt Argument; Therefore faith is better then all reaſon and philoſophy in this matter: Again he ſaith, <hi>By faith we underſtand,</hi>

The manner how, not as Artificers make a houſe by handy labour but <hi>by the Word of his mouth only.</hi> And laſtly, here is the matter of which, <hi>of things that did not appear,</hi> that is either of nothing, or elſe it's an alluſion to <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.2. where the <hi>earth</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>without form and void,</hi> darkneſſe covered it; Thus, here is a noble deſcription of the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal of the world.</p>
            <p>This being fully confirmed let us open the Doctrine. And</p>
            <p n="1">1. Conſider, <hi>That the Chriſtian faith doth only clearly and fully inform us of the beginning of the world</hi>; It's an expreſſion the Scripture hath often, <hi>Before the foundations of the earth were laid</hi>; As for thoſe Philoſophers called Peripa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teticks, whoſe Maſter was <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> they generally affirmed the world was from Eternity, indeed it's doubted what <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> minde was, but it's plain in his Topicks, he makes this Propoſition, whether the world be eternall, only a dialecticall Probleme, a Propoſition that might be diſputed either way, as having no certainty in it, and indeed how can it be otherwiſe, for that is a received Maxime with them, <hi>Ex nihilo nihil fit</hi>; This is the foundation of all their Philoſophy, and therefore grant this, then the world could not be made, but how ignorant were the great and learned men in the world of Gods pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, that which the leaſt babe almoſt in Chriſtianity doth know; As for thoſe diſputes of ſome, who though they acknowledge <hi>de facto,</hi> that the world was created in time, yet queſtion whether it was poſſible that it might have been from the beginning; It's a needleſſe and unprofitable Queſtion, What cauſe then have we to bleſſe God for Scripture-light, when the great learning of the world, was wholly in darkneſſe in this reſpect.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Although Scripture be the ſureſt and choiceſt argument, yet <hi>there are many convictions from reaſon likewiſe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. From Reaſon.</note> that may convince men that it had a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning.</p>
            <p>As in the firſt place, <hi>If it had been from Eternity ſo many thouſands and thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands years would have been paſt, that we ſhould have had ſome reliques at leaſt of ſome things done ſo long ago</hi>; whereas it's obſerved by the learned that even in all the heathen Antiquities, though they brag much yet they record nothing, that was done before the Floud; The utmoſt of their antiquity reacheth but to perſons and things that were done ſince the Floud, and therefore <hi>Moſes</hi> his Hiſtory hath the moſt antiquity in it, Now if the world had been ſo many millions of years before, how comes there to be ſuch a deep ſilence of all things done formerly, as for that of the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> who ſpeak of things done an hundred thouſand years agoe; Beſides the fabulouſneſſe of that people, it's thought they accounted a year, but for a moneth, becauſe the courſe of the Sun was not perfectly underſtood.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>This may convince the world had a beginning, becauſe it could not make it ſelf, and God was not a naturall Agent neceſſitated to make it</hi>; For upon theſe two ſuppoſed grounds it might be thought, that the world had no beginning, and as for making it ſelf that's plain, it could not, no more then an houſe, or a muſical Inſtrument, or a Book; Hence it is that the Apoſtle <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. makes theſe creatures the Looking glaſſe to repreſent the wiſedom and power of God, and certainly the world had it made it ſelf, would have given a more
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:65216:94"/>
glorious being to all the parts thereof, ſo that it's plain it was limited in its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and parts, as the authour thereof pleaſed, and in the next place, <hi>God was not neceſſitated to make it</hi>; As the fire cannot but burn, as the Bee ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily makes it's curious honeycomb, ſo that although ſome have ſaid, that as ſoon as the Sunne is, ſo neceſſarily and immediatly the Sun beams will be alſo, ſo as ſoon as God is, there muſt neceſſarily be a world, yet we muſt not conceive a leſſe perfection in God then is in man, <hi>who is a free Agent,</hi> and works his effects of art, when he pleaſeth; The Artificer is not neceſſitated to make a houſe, or a garment, then certainly much more muſt be allowed to God himſelf, who doth in heaven and in earth what he pleaſeth, and this ſhould ſatisfie thoſe curious Queſtions why God made the world no ſooner, what he did in that long imaginary time before the world was, the freedom of God and his abſolute Soveraignty, with his infinite wiſedom, may eaſily ſtop ſuch mouths.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>To be from Eternity is the property of God, God only is eternal, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no finite limited thing can thus be without a beginning</hi>; The world is finite in its <hi>number,</hi> it's but one world, whereas God might create more worlds as well as one; It's finite in <hi>nature,</hi> It's finite in its <hi>parts,</hi> It's finite in its <hi>uſe,</hi> and it's fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite in duration; Hence all the Nations of the world comparatively to God are laid to be but as a drop, and as a little <hi>light duſt,</hi> Iſa. 40 15. Seeing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the world is not infinite, but is every way limited, it cannot be eternal; and this is the reaſon why we Chriſtians ſhould lift our hearts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the world, which had a beginning unto God, who is God from everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to everlaſting.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>The world was not without beginning, but made in time, becauſe it's corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptible</hi>; It's ſubject to a diſſolution, Now what is without a beginning is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an end; If it had a beginn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ng it's ſubject to an end, though God indeed may perpetuate it, as we ſee he doth Angels and Men; Now that the world is ſubject to deſtruction ſome have proved it from this, becauſe there is <hi>a decay in nature</hi>; They ſay the very Sun and heavens have not that power and influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence they had formerly, but I finde learned men utterly diſavowing ſuch a Poſition, and they maintain that nature is ſtill the ſame, and is as conſtant and powerful in operation as ever. Therefore from the Scripture we ſee clearly the corruptibility of it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. The whole Creation is ſaid to be <hi>ſubject unto vanity and corruption, ſo that it groaneth for a freedome,</hi> and 2 Pet. 3. We have there a large deſcription of the Funerals of the whole world, <hi>The heavens ſhall paſſe away with a noiſe, and the Elements with a burning heat,</hi> &amp;c. Indeed the learned do diſpute whether the world in all the choice parts of it ſhall ſuffer an utter abolition, or only a perfective alteration; But whatſoever it be, a wonderful change ſhall be made of it, and therefore the Apoſtle from this amazing diſſolution, inferreth, <hi>Seeing theſe things ſhall be, what manner of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ought we to be</hi>; <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>THis ſixth Verſe begins the ſecond main general part of Chriſts Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for whereas before he had praied for himſelf, now he begins to pray for his <hi>Diſciples,</hi> as they were in a peculiar manner given to him, as afterwards he praieth for <hi>all beleevers</hi> in the generall, ſo that the words are a beginning of Chriſts Petition in a peculiar manner, for the <hi>Apostles,</hi> for they needed much praier and aſſiſtance who were to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take ſo great a duty; Theſe were ſet in the forefront of the Battel, Theſe were called to labour in the heat of the day, therefore there is a peculiar prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er for them: Now that our Saviours Petition may prevail, he firſt declareth what he had done to them, and 2.

            <p>We now come to conſider <hi>the perſon himſelf,</hi> and that is <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who ſaith of himſelf, <hi>I have manifeſted thy Name</hi>; Chriſt ſpeaks in this as he is the great Prophet, and chief Shepherd of our ſouls, for being intruſted with this of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, he did faithfully diſcharge it, whoever reads over Chriſts life, and ſeeth how laborious and diligent he was to bring men to the knowledge of God, and to ſave their ſouls, muſt needs ſay, The Lion of the Tribe of <hi>Judah</hi> went up and down more earneſtly to ſave then the roaring Lion of hell is buſie to deſtroy, Hence <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. while he is emploied to bring home but one poor Sheep that was gone aſtray, the Woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi> he is ſo earneſt in it that he forgets to eat his bread, and tels them <hi>his meat and drink was to do his Fathers will,</hi> which was to declare the truth of God, and invite ſinners to come in unto him, ſo then we ſee here, an excellent Preſident for all the Miniſters of the Goſpel to follow; As Chriſt was wholly in this, to make people know God, ſo ought they to be; In Chriſts works of his Mediatorſhip, and of his Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, we may not imitate him, we cannot, but in this of his labour and tender love to mens ſouls, we are bound to follow him.</p>

Now <hi>Paul</hi> kept himſelf thus pure by declaring unto them <hi>all the Counſell of God,</hi> ſo that if we would doe our duty we muſt be Lights ſhining upon the underſtandings of men, that they may know, beleeve in, and obey God; And ſo <hi>Paul</hi> again at large, 1 <hi>The.</hi> 2.

of this great and neceſſary end; To open the doctrine, you may take notice that as the <hi>Logicians</hi> ſpeak of a twofold end, <hi>Finis operis</hi> and <hi>Finis operantis,</hi> the end of the worker, and the end of the works, as the end of the houſe built, is to dwell in it; The end of the Artificer who built is to have wherewith to maintain himſelf and his Family, ſo it's in the Preaching of the Word, There is the end of the Miniſtry it ſelf as appointed by God, and of the Miniſter who preacheth; Now indeed there ſhould be alwaies the ſame end of both, The Miniſter ſhould aim at that end for which the Miniſtry is appointed, <hi>viz.</hi> to <hi>enlighten men, to bring them to a ſaving knowledge of God,</hi> but ſuch are mens cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions that they many times take the office only for ambition or earthly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages; They preach that they may live, they live not that they may preach; It's therefore a dangerous thing for a Miniſter of Chriſt to propound any other end principally at leaſt but what is the end of the Miniſtery, and that is whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpirituall, to be able to ſay, <hi>Behold here I am and the ſpirituall Children thou haſt given me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. As the end of the Miniſtry is thus to bring light in the world, ſo the end of all people that enjoy a Miniſtry in all their hearing and coming to Church ought to be thus likewiſe: As the Miniſter ſinnes greatly if he preacheth to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance his parts, his Name, to humour people in their ſins, ſo do the people ſin dangerouſly if they come out of formality and cuſtome, or if they come to have the ear and fancy pleaſed but attend not at all to the ſaving knowledge of God; Oh thou fooliſh and vain man, thou makeſt not a good uſe or improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Miniſter till it hath thus wrought upon thee; Therefore the Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and prophaneſſe of moſt men, proclaimeth that they never made a right uſe of one Sabbath or one Sermon all their life time, though they have heard many; Oh then that every Sabbath day you would put this queſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If I do not attain to the end I loſe my labour; Is it not the end of preaching and the end of hearing to deliver me from my former Ignorance, my former luſts; how then comes it about that I am ſtill as I was? It is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I do not conſider the end of theſe things.</p>

Seeing then we are all by nature Bats and Owls not enduring the Light of the Sunne; Seeing then we have innate darkneſſe,<note place="margin">From the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of it.</note> and much voluntary blindeneſſe upon our mindes, oh how diligent ſhould the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the Goſpel be to bring this light into peoples hearts; Therefore our Saviour makes this the condemnation, the great cauſe of condemnation, <hi>That light is come into the world, and men love darkneſſe rather then light,</hi> Joh. 3. If then people did think they had a thick cloud upon their hearts, or a vail up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their eyes, how carefull would they be to attend upon the Word preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that they might of darkneſſe become light in the Lord.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>There is a neceſſity of attending to this end, if you conſider the averſeneſſe and unwillingneſſe that is in men to get this knowledge</hi>; How many ſay with thoſe in <hi>Job, Let the knowledge of the moſt High depart from us,</hi> Job 21.14. that when they are invited have this luſt or that ſin, this or that worldly advantage to look after; How many when wiſedom crieth aloud do yet with the ſimple one paſſe by to their deſtruction; The Prophets and the Apoſtles all along com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of this wretched diſpoſition, that their hearers had a deaf ear, a ſtiffe

            <p>THE next thing conſiderable is, The <hi>deſcription of the Subject,</hi> about which Chriſt did thus imploy himſelf, and they are ſet out</p>

            <p n="2">2. From the term <hi>from which,</hi> they are <hi>given out of the world,</hi> They are given to Chriſt out of the world.</p>
            <p>The Scripture in this Chapter makes a diſtinction of being <hi>in</hi> the world, and <hi>of</hi> the world; The people of God, even as Chriſt himſelf and his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom are <hi>in</hi> the world, but they are not <hi>of</hi> the world; As a Stranger in a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Countrey, he is in that Countrey but not of it; he hath not the nature, the Language, nor doth he accuſtome himſelf to the faſhion of that place, Thus it is with the godly, Though they are born and ſo live in the world, yet their natures and affections, and converſations are not worldly; As the Fowls that were at firſt created out of the water yet did not continue there but flew up to heaven and continue for the moſt part there; As clouds though of the earth, yet are carried about after the motions of the heavens; They are not then given out of the world, ſo as if every good man were preſently upon his godlineſſe removed out of this earth to heaven; but in reſpect of their <hi>nature, affections,</hi> and <hi>converſation;</hi>

Sometimes it's taken for the greater part of the world, as they ſaid all the world did run after Chriſt, or the world ſaid to be taxed by <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> Luk. 2.1.

it, and Elements of the world, becauſe men by humane wiſedom without the Scripture do preſſe them and do not walk by the light of Gods Word; This then is an excellent diſcovery that we are not of the world, when in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion eſpecially in our worſhip of God, and the way of our juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, we are not carried by the principles of a worldly Religion but by divine direction, when we do not worſhip God according to cuſtome, to univerſali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and ſuch rudiments of the world as moſt do; The Pagan, the Papiſt diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers a very worldly Spirit in his Religion, being able to ſay no more for it then Heathens have done, and ſo in the matters of juſtification; They ſay but very little more then <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and the Philoſophers of the world have done about righteouſneſſe, whereas the righteouſneſſe and grace of the Goſpel is wholly different from ſuch principles, manifeſt then by thy adoration of the fulneſſe of the Scripture, and ſufficiency thereof, that thy religion, thy worſhip, thy hopes of ſalvation are not meerly upon worldly principles, and not ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> Thirdly, <hi>The godly man is diſcovered not to be of the world, by his conſtant life and converſation</hi>; He doth not live as one that takes this world for his home,<note place="margin">He lives not as others do.</note> They declare by their words and actions <hi>they ſeek for another Countrey,</hi> Heb. 11.

What ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>James, Pure Religion is to keep a man unſpotted from the world; Pure Religion</hi>; There is a generation of devils rather then men that mock and deride at purity; Thus the Apoſtle ſaith there muſt be a pure Religion, and this pure Religion is to keep us unſpotted from the world; That doth imply the world to be ſome lothſome noiſome dunghill, that a man cannot be in it, but he is ready to get ſoil and filth upon him; how many truſt to ſin, come and do as we do, will you be ſo pure? but whether will you beleeve the Word of God or the devil tempting by ſuch beaſtly Inſtruments?</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV,"/> Fourthly, <hi>He is diſcovered not to be off the world becauſe he is principally taken up with heavenly priviledges,</hi> Jam. 4.4. <hi>The friendſhip of this world is enmity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God</hi>; and 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.15. <hi>If any man love the world the love of the Father is not in him</hi>; It's as impoſſible a man that is godly ſhould be of the world in this ſence, as it is for Doves to be Moles, they cannot live by digging into the earth; Hence the godly man is ſaid to be <hi>born of God,</hi> he is ſaid to be <hi>heavenly,</hi> to be <hi>from above, to he riſen with Chriſt, to ſit in heavenly places, to have his Converſation in heaven</hi>; Theſe are the noble deſcriptions of the godly man, ſo that though they uſe the world, and diſcharge their Relations there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, yet they are not overcome by the world; They have the world, the world hath not them; Oh how cloſe may this diſcovery be, for there are many who eſcape the pollutions of the world, and yet are worldly: The third kinde of hearers did not only caſt off all prophaneſſe, but made ſome great progreſſe in obedience to the Word, but the love of the world and the cares about it
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:65216:103"/>
choaked all; Did not <hi>Judas</hi> appear as eminently for Chriſt as any at firſt? but the love of the world diſcovered his rottenneſſe; Did not <hi>Demas</hi> get appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, and that by <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf? yet at laſt he did cleave to this preſent world, ſo that not only prophaneſſe but immoderate, earthly and worldly affections; Theſe are inconſiſtent with the power of grace; The world is not only the prophaneſs thereof, but the immoderate and exceſſive affections to the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful things of the world; Our Saviour doth not ſay, He that loveth his <hi>ſins</hi> or his <hi>luſts</hi> more then me, but <hi>he that loveth his Father, wife, or life it ſelf more then me is not worthy of me,</hi> Mat. 10.37. See then the difficulty of grace and tremble under it, Thou haſt with much ado quit thy former ſins, but do not the inordinate affections about lawful things ſtill enſnare thee? Doſt thou <hi>buy as if thou boughtſt not? Doſt thou marry as if thou marriedſt not?</hi> 1 Cor. 7. Art thou rich as if thou wert not?

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/> Fifthly, <hi>In this it's apparent they are not of the world becauſe the world hateth them, and is wholly oppoſite to them,</hi> Joh 17.14. <hi>Becauſe they are not of the world therefore that hateth them, If they were of the world the world would love his own</hi>; and 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.5. <hi>They that are of the world ſpeak of the world, and the world heareth them</hi>; There cannot be a better diſcovery then this, <hi>The world knoweth his own,</hi> Let a man be a wiſe worldly man that matters not religion, that regards not the power of godlineſſe, nor ſtrictneſſe; Such a man this world adoreth; But if a man be never ſo wiſe, ſo excellent, yet if powerfully godly will not conform to the evil waies of the world, this marreth all; This makes him envied and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; Who art thou then that haſt ſome deſires to walk in the way to heaven, but the oppoſition, the hatred and violence that is uſed againſt that way makes thee draw back? Oh fooliſh and deluded wretch, was it not thus with Chriſt, with his Apoſtles? Were they not told they ſhould <hi>be hated of all men for his Names ſake?</hi> There cannot be a more comfortable ſign of thy grace then to have all the wicked men where thou liveſt, either thy hypocritical Friends, or thy open enemies; <hi>Jerome</hi> thanked God that he was worthy to be ſuch an one whom the world would hate; The Serpents Seed cannot love the Womans; <hi>Iſmaell</hi> will perſecute <hi>Iſaac,</hi> glory therefore and boaſt in this, if the malicious wicked man hath his mouth alwaies open againſt thee, If he be alwaies cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and backbiting; For if thou wouldeſt be prophane, diſſolute, if thou wouldſt be a Miniſter to proſtitute the Ordinances of God to every prophane man, thou wouldſt be as good as any in the world but now it's not for thy infirmities but thy graces they malice thee.</p>

Now a worldly life is only by ſence and carnal reaſon; It moveth only upon ſenſible grounds, coming as far ſhort of faith as a beaſt doth of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but the godly man, he looketh into the Word of God, he ſeeth the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes and embraceth them; This life of faith is a myſtery, it is a Riddle, yea,

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> To open this Conſider the diſtinction before premiſed,<note place="margin">Conſider,</note> That we may be ſaid to be the Lords, either generally by right of Creation and his abſolute Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty; or 2. Peculiarly in a gracious manner: In the former ſence all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde is ſaid to be in Gods hand as the clay in the hand of the Potter. ſo that if God from wiſe and moſt righteous ends have choſen ſome and left others in their damnable eſtate, if we cannot ſay that all are by Gods Election and Chriſts by the execution of it, yet we have no cauſe to grudge or repine, becauſe all are Gods, to diſpoſe of at his pleaſure; For although his holy and righteous nature is the cauſe that he cannot do any thing that is evil or unjuſt, yet the dominion and ſoveraignty he hath may make him diſpoſe of all things as he pleaſeth, and if the Apoſtle in matters of Election and Reprobation doth urge this to ſtifle mans preſumption, how much more may it hold in inferiour things, if God deny thee this or that mercy and giveth it to others, who art thou (O man) that argueſt againſt God? We are his to be diſpoſed of as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth:</p>
            <p>But 2. That which we are now to, ſpeak to is the propriety and right God hath in ſome more then in others by his grace and meer love; Alas the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer propriety argueth no comfort, the damned in hell, yea, the very devils may pleade the former; Lord, we are thine by creation and dominion, but that is no ground of comfort, only this latter is an unanſwerable argument, God himſelf cannot deny this, when we can pray, <hi>Lord, we are thine by thy peculiar grace and purpoſe of love, We did not of our ſelves become thus, it was thy good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to make us thy own; It was free for thee to have done with us as thou pleaſeſt, but now we are thine, it belongs to thee to ſave thy own.</hi>

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> Secondly, <hi>This right and propriety is mutually reciprocal</hi>; God is theirs and they are Gods, only Gods propriety in them is the cauſe of their propriety in God, <hi>You have not choſen me, but I have choſen you,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.16. So that this is very comfortable to obſerve, that this right is mutuall, God is their God, and they are his people, God challengeth them as his, and they may claim God as theirs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as you ſee the Covenant of grace runneth reciprocally, <hi>I will be their God and they ſhall be my people,</hi> Jer. 31.33. this is expreſſed under thoſe ſimilitudes of a <hi>Vine</hi> and a <hi>branch,</hi> of an <hi>husband</hi> and a <hi>Wife</hi>; The wife hath power over and right to her husband as well as the Husband to the Wife, The Vine hath a relation to the branches as well as the branches to the Vine, only as the good of the branch lieth in being in the Vine, but the Vine doth not fetch ſuccour from the branch; So it's here, we are the Lords and the Lord is ours, only the Lord hath no advantage, nor hath he any good in that we are his, but the cauſe of our happineſſe is that he is ours, ſo then let the people of God know, that the ground and riſe of all their ſpirituall advantage is becauſe God hath a propriety in them, not ſo much becauſe they have a propriety in God; It's becauſe God loveth them, God will not looſe what is his, that they are preſerved from ſinne and hell; Indeed till we be actually Gods by beleeving, though we be his by Election, yet we cannot make uſe of our Intereſt; That is hidden and ſecret; <hi>Paul</hi> though he was the Lords by Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on before the foundations of the world, yet till brought home, till beleeving, he cannot ſay, the Lord is his, Therefore till God be ours both by Election and the ſaving effects of it, we cannot ſay, <hi>I am my Beloveds, and my Beloved is mine,</hi> Cant. 2.16.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> Therefore Thirdly, <hi>Our comfort and joy lieth in the diſcovery of our propriety
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:65216:105"/>
and interest in God</hi>; for though we be his, yet if we beleeve it not, it is as if we did not belong to him; It's ſaid, <hi>David encouraged himſelf in his God,</hi> 1 Sam. 30.6. The evidence of his propriety was his encouragement, and <hi>Paul</hi> acknowledgeth an appropiration, when ſpeaking of Chriſt, he ſaid, <hi>Who loved me and gave himſelf for me,</hi> Gal. 2.20. Hence it is that our Saviour upon his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture out of the world doth ſo fully inform his Diſciples, that he will be theirs ſtill though he bodily leaveth them; That the propriety and intereſt they have in him is not taken away; Hence alſo it is that an elected man while uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, can take no more comfort from God or his promiſe then a reprobate, becauſe as yet his propriety is not evidenced; As yet there is no ground of any claim or holy boldneſſe at the Throne of grace, Therefore it's a main du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the people of God to ſtudy this Point above all, <hi>viz.</hi> their propriety in God, Am I the Lords or no? It's not impoſſible to finde out the truth of this, though Satan and our hearts are very much tempting to the contrary; there are few that can eſcape the ſtorms and tempeſts that ariſe in this matter, and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly anchor their ſouls on God.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV,"/> Fourthly, <hi>There are two ſpecial and eminent cauſes of our being the Lords trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and peculiar people</hi>; The one is the Lords power and might, the other his infinite grace and love; That which is the Sun and giveth heat and warmth more eſpecially, is the mercy and love of God, for we by ſin though we could not make our ſelves no creatures of his, ſo that he ſhould not deſtroy or damn us, yet we made our ſelves no children of his, we caſt our ſelves out of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, of a loving Father we made him an enraged enemy. and ſo according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we pulled down all vengeance upon our heads, we forfeited every mercy we know not the leaſt drop of comfort that belongs unto us, but all the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of God threatned in his Law, this and no other could we expect, we ere no more the Lords then the devils and damned in hell; Therefore it was the meer goodneſſe of God not to caſt us off, but to make us his a ſecond time up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on better Covenants of mercy, ſo that if any ſoul comes to know this, that he is now the Lords, he hath cauſe with aſtoniſhment and amazement to fall down and admite the grace of God, we did not make our ſelves his, we could not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come his people of our own ſtrength.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There was the power of God alſo greatly diſcovered, for ſeeing by ſinne we become the devils, and he had a right to us, he is the god of the world, and he rules in the hearts of thoſe that are diſobedient, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. ſeeing I ſay he is their Father and they are of him, and his works they do, it's impoſſible we ſhould be recovered out of his hands, till God who is ſtronger then he ſets us free; As our Saviour implieth in that Parable, when a ſtrong man keepeth the houſe all things are quiet, till a ſtronger then he cometh, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.22. It was not then in the power of Man or Angels to expedite himſelf out of that bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage and ſlavery, till God did wonderfully ſhew his power, and as it was not in their power, ſo neither in their will or heart; Though it be ſuch an unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able happ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Oh it's not enough in a dull cold manner to think and hear of the promiſe, but thou art to run and embrace it as one overjoyed, as <hi>Simeon</hi> did Chriſt in his arms, and then to think, thou even haſt enough; This is fiducial recumbency on Chriſt, a holy boldneſſe in God as a Father, and herein the people of God are many times to be blamed, you receive the true doctrine of God to beleeve it, his Commandments to obey them, his threatnings you tremble under, but the promiſes by ſtrong acts of faith you do not embrace, you do not take him for your Mediatour on whom you truſt in the midſt of all your infirmities and weakneſſes, yea, you rather doubt whether you may or no lay hold on the promiſe, you ſay of it as <hi>Peter</hi> to Chriſt, <hi>Depart from me for I am a ſinner</hi>; you think Chriſt would be angry with you as that woman thought If you touch the promiſe; Oh remember that the godly will keep the word of promiſe, receive that as well as the command; They know it's a ſin of an high nature to refuſe God comforting as well as commanding, yea in ſome reſpects it's worſe, for when you ſin againſt the command of God, you ſin againſt his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verraignty, but when againſt his promiſes you ſin againſt his love and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; That wherein he intends to get himſelf the greateſt glory by, oh then when Satan tempts and thy heart is cloudy, Thou puts off the promiſe, think how can I do this and ſin againſt God?

See what quick work God makes, and how it is growth he looks at, <hi>Every branch in him that bringeth not forth fruit he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth away</hi>; God loves not ſlothfulneſſe and unprofitableneſſe no more then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneſſe; He doth not ſay, If it bring forth poiſonous fruit or wilde grapes, but if it bring forth no good fruit, and if any doth fructifie, then he purgeth it <hi>that it may bring forth more fruit</hi>; See here the Husbandmans care is ſtill for more fruit; If thou art no better then thou waſt, if thy faith, thy love have not an encreaſe Gods expectations are not anſwered; Hence <hi>Heb</hi> 6. thoſe that are babes in Chriſt are ſeverely reproved, and they are to be carried on to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; Not to grow is a kinde of barrenneſſe, yea, it's a degree to Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize; Therefore the Apoſtle in that place threatens ſuch Non proficients with that dreadful ſinne of Apoſtacy, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1. <hi>Let us perfect holineſſe in the fear of God</hi>; It's not enough to have holineſſe but we are to perfect it, and he that hath any fear of God will thus endeavour, and certainly if the rich man would have more wealth, the great man more greatneſſe, how much rather the godly man, more godlineſſe.</p>

            <p>THE circumſtance of time being diſpatched which declared the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples growth and proficiency.</p>
            <p>We proceed to the Object of their faith and knowledge, That <hi>Christ had all things from the Father</hi>; and ſo was the Meſſias ſent by him; The excellency and dignity of this Faith is to be handled in the next verſe.</p>
            <p>We ſhall here take notice of the nature of it;</p>
            <p>In the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> verſe of this Chapter it was made Eternal life <hi>to know Jeſus Chriſt</hi> as ſent by the Father, and here our Saviour affirmeth that his Diſciples had this knowledge, <hi>viz.</hi> That he was the true Meſſias in whom alone ſalvation is to be expected: That he was no falſe Prophet or Impoſtor, as his adverſaries accuſed, but they knew he came from God, and acknowledged every thing he had to be of God, ſo that this expreſſion may be parallelled with that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion <hi>Peter</hi> made in the Name of the diſciples, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.69. We beleeve and are ſure that thou art that Chriſt the Sonne of the living God; Therefore they would not leave him becauſe he only had the words of eternal life.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Doct.</hi> It's our duty to know and beleeve in Chriſt as the only Mediator ſent by God.</note>Obſ. <hi>It's our ſpecial duty to know and beleeve in Chriſt, as the only Mediator ſent by God</hi>; We are to know Chriſt is of God appointed to be our Saviour; This is the Faith ſo often required in the Goſpel, and which is ſo powerfull that <hi>he who beleeveth ſhall be ſaved, but he that doth not the anger of God abideth on him</hi>; and indeed how can he deſerve the Title and Name of a Chriſtian that doth not thus know or beleeve, but upon ſearch it will appear that there are few do thus know Chriſt.</p>
            <p>To open this Point, the Doctrine hath three particulars;</p>
            <p>Firſt implied, <hi>That whatſoever Chriſt had as Mediatour he had it not for himſelf but in reference to us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That this was wholly of Gods will and appointment that he ſhould have for us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>That it's our duty to beleeve in and receive him thus appointed by God,</hi> And all theſe particulars will be accounted ſweeter then the honeycomb to the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty hungry ſoul, that findes it ſelf undone without Chriſt; Though to thoſe
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:65216:112"/>
who are full of their ſins or their own righteouſneſſe this very honeycomb is lothſome; Oh then that this Truth might overtake you that hear it, as <hi>David</hi> did the poor fainting famiſhed <hi>Amalekite,</hi> to whom thoſe cluſters of Raiſins he gave were ſo reviving, if with <hi>Jonathan</hi> you taſte but a little of this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, your eyes will be enlightned.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The implied Truth is, <hi>That whatſoever Chriſt had or was,</hi>
               <note place="margin">I. What Chriſt had or was as Mediator was for us.</note> 
               <hi>was not for himſelf but for us</hi>; His fulneſſe was for our emptineſſe, his atonement for our ſins; Even as the full breaſts are for ſuck to the childe, or as the efficacy and vertue of the head is for the parts of the body, and as the fulneſſe of the Fountain is for the ſtreams; Thus <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9. <hi>To us a Son is born, to us a childe is given,</hi> All that Chriſt had and was it was ours, it was for our advantge; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was called <hi>Emmanuel,</hi> God with us, and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. <hi>Chriſt is made of God unto us wiſedom, righteouſneſſe, and ſanctification,</hi> So that it's plain Chriſt was not a Meſſias, a Mediatour, in reference to himſelf, that is impoſſible, but to us: For if we take the main particulars in Chriſt, we ſhall ſee how they all tend to beleevers, that had it not been for their good, ſuch things had never been.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>His Incarnation</hi> and becoming man, This was of God for us,<note place="margin">I. His Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> 
               <hi>To us</hi> a childe is born, as you heard, not to Angels, nor for any other end, There had not been ſuch a truth in the Word as God to become man, but for the godly mans neceſſity and ſalvation; This is more then to ſay, The world and all the Creatures were made for man, and yet if the Pſalmiſt was ſo affected that all things in the earth were for man, how much more then that the Word is made fleſh for man, oh what an encouragement have the true Diſciples of Chriſt from this, was not ſuch a glorious myſtery performed for my ſake, was it not for me that God was made man? For this you muſt know, that if there had been but one man of all mankinde to be ſaved, Chriſt would have died, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>Who gave himſelf for me,</hi> Gal. 2.20. and it was not the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of beleevers which made Chriſt become man, for alas they are but gleanings in reſpect of all mankinde, but it was becauſe ſuch were given to him as a Mediatour, and ſo he would be faithfull for one as well as for many.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>All that Chriſt did</hi> it was not in reference to himſelf but <hi>for us</hi>;<note place="margin">2. All that he did His Miracles.</note> All the Miracles he wrought it was for Beleevers, he did them not for his glory and honour, as he ſpeaks about <hi>Lazarus</hi> his being dead, <hi>Joh.</hi> 11. <hi>I was glad for your ſakes,</hi> becauſe that Miracles might tend to their Confirmation in the Faith.</p>
            <p>Thus Chriſt became obedient to the Law, and fulfilled the righteouſneſſe thereof for our ſakes, Oh what an admirable overwhelming Point is this,<note place="margin">Obedience to the Law.</note> that all the labour and obedience which Chriſt performed, of which he ſaid, <hi>It was meat and drink to do his Fathers will,</hi> Joh. 4. That all this ſhould not be for himſelf, but in reference to us; How may this fill our hearts and mouths with joy and confidence at the Throne of grace; O Lord, why did Chriſt ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill all righteouſneſſe? why did he perfectly obey the Law, So that no fault ſhould be found in him? Was not all this for me? Did he need this him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf?</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>His ſufferings and rendring up himſelf as an atonement and Sacrifice upon the Croſſe,</hi> This alſo was wholly of God for us;<note place="margin">His ſufferings.</note> The Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> is affected with it, <hi>He laid upon him the iniquities of us all, and by his ſtripes we are healed,</hi> Iſa. 53.5.

And here is admirable ground of hopes and confidence, for it's not againſt the Fathers will, yea, all this is of his gracious appointment, that Chriſt ſhould be thus a Mediatour for his Children; Doubt not then whether the Father will accept of what Chriſt hath done or not; Do not queſtion whether he will receive thee in Chriſts Name, for the Father hath manifeſted as great willingneſſe for thy Salvation as the Son; Say then, Oh holy Father, here is ſure a wonderful way for my acceptance at the Throne of grace, that I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhed at it, and it's of thy goodneſſe and grace that ſuch a way is procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; Oh what then can hinder but that I be juſtified; The Father willing, and the Son willing, yea, the Father loving Chriſt, <hi>becauſe he laid down his life for the Sheep,</hi> Joh. 10.17. All this makes for the encouragement of the godly.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <p>III. It's the duty of all Gods people to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve this ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in Chriſt for them.</p>
                  <p>The ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents or conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitants of Faith.</p>
               </note>The third particular is, <hi>That it's the duty of all Gods Children to know and beleeve this fulneſſe in Chriſt for them, and to look upon Chriſt with all his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits as for them</hi>: Now faith thus fixed on Chriſt hath theſe either ingredient or concomitant acts and effects.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>There is a knowledge and a ſound diſcovery of this ſufficiency in Chriſt</hi>; You ſee here knowing and beleeving put together; Ignorance of this Point that all in Chriſt is for the beleever breedeth much diſpondency, and takes off the wheels of thy Chariots: They look upon Chriſt as a Fountain ſealed up, as <hi>a garden encloſed,</hi> They apprehend it's not for every godly perſon to go and drink of this fountain,<note place="margin">1.</note> unleſſe attaining to ſuch an high meaſure of grace; Whereas a true knowledge of the end and uſe of Chriſt would quickly diſpell all ſuch black thoughts.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="195" facs="tcp:65216:113"/>2. <hi>To beleeve doth imply a relying and reſting of the ſoul upon this fulneſſe</hi>;<note place="margin">2. A relying and reſting of the ſoul upon Chriſts fulneſs</note> Chriſt with his righteouſneſſe is the center of his heart; He truſts and puts his whole confidence in it; He need go out no further to ſeek, here is enough, he fears no breaking, no ſhaking, as long as Chriſt will laſt and endure, ſo long ſhall he; As a man that treads on the firm ground, he fears not as he that walks on ſlippery Ice; Thus the godly man leaneth on a firm foundation, but he that truſteth in his own righteouſneſſe or works, melts as Ice before the Sunne.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>There is a full ſatisfaction of the ſoul in this beleeving</hi>; So that it removeth all cares and fears, Have I enough or no? Is it ſufficient to carry me out?<note place="margin">3. There is a full ſatisfaction of the ſoul in this beleeving.</note> He is therefore ſaid <hi>to ſave to the uttermoſt,</hi> Heb. 5. and it's called <hi>The riches of grace by Chriſt, the unſearchable riches</hi>; He therefore that beleeveth in Chriſt thus as ſent of God, he may ſay, <hi>Return O my ſoul into thy Reſt, for the Lord hath dealt bountifully with thee</hi>; what can ſatisfie if a Chriſt with all his benefits cannot; yea, if a godly man were to deſire a way for to put him out of all doubts between God and his ſoul, what better way could he require then this.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>In beleeving there is a receiving, and a participation of all that Chriſt hath,</hi>
               <note place="margin">4. A receiving of what Chriſt hath.</note> and hence <hi>receiving</hi> and <hi>beleeving</hi> is put for one another; It's alſo metapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rically expreſſed by <hi>eating</hi> and <hi>drinking,</hi> Joh 6. That as by thoſe actions we receive meat, and it becometh our very ſubſtance, ſo it is here, by belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in him Chriſt is made ours, even all that he hath is ours; Thus by Faith we are ſaid to be <hi>branches partaking of the fatneſſe of the Olive,</hi> Rom. 11. Oh then how excellent is this act of Faith, which is the hand to put on all the glorious robes of Chriſt upon our ſoul; It being not enough to know there is a Chriſt ſo qualified unleſſe he become ours.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>This beleeving works an holy confidence and boldneſſe at the Throne of grace</hi>; It makes our praiers and duties full of fervency and alacrity, <hi>Eph.</hi>
               <note place="margin">5. A holy bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe at the Throne of grace.</note> 3.12. <hi>We come with boldneſſe through Faith</hi>; We ſee the Scepter is held out, and ſo we may readily enter in, and <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.16. <hi>Let us come with boldneſſe to the Throne of grace</hi>; Oh how much ſhould the broken hearted ſinner live in the Meditation of theſe things, God opens the way by his grace, and thou ſhutteſt it by thy unbelief; Through Chriſt the way to heaven is made a broad way, and thy doubtings make it narrow: When Chriſt cals <hi>Peter</hi> to come to him, though upon the waters, it's not preſumption but diſobedience if <hi>Peter</hi> refuſe?</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>This is accompanied with large and vaſt thoughts of Chriſt</hi>;<note place="margin">6. Large and vaſt thoughts of Chriſt.</note> This file their hearts and mouths with Chriſt, as you ſee the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> in every verſe almoſt affectionately mentioning him, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. with what diſdain doth he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce and throw away all things in compariſon of Chriſt, The excellency of the knowledge of Chriſt, and at another time, <hi>He would know nothing but Chriſt crucified,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.2. He that doth thus beleeve in Chriſt ſo manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, cannot but have his ſoul and all within him taken up this way; Though there be many ſpeak of Chriſt, and talk of Chriſt, yet none hath him indeed; and none do truely eſteem him but ſuch perſons as theſe; Is then Chriſt dearer and cloſer to thy heart then all earthly comforts and delights? Canſt thou ſay, the thoughts of Chriſt are ſweet, the meditations about him are my meat and drink all the day long, this is precious.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, <hi>This purifieth the heart, and makes us an holy, heavenly people;</hi>
               <note place="margin">8. Faith purifieth and makes holy.</note> 
               <hi>If we be riſen with Chriſt, we ſet our affections on things above,</hi> Col. 3.1, 2. and <hi>he that hath this hope purifieth himſelf as God is pure,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.3. Act. 15 9. As the Sun brings heat and light where it is, ſo where faith is it makes the heat active and operative, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.

               <hi>The ſence of their guilt and all the miſery ſinne hath brought upon them puts them into a melting yeelding frame</hi>; while mens hearts are hardened and they are not apprehenſive of the damnable eſtate they are in, while they are not in the fire of Gods diſpleaſure, they are ſtubborn and untractable, but when they are kindely humbled for ſin then they will do anything; Thus <hi>Paul,</hi> He that was mad in his oppoſitions againſt Chriſt, no ſooner did the Lord touch his heart with the ſenſe of his ſins but he crieth out, <hi>Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?</hi> Thus <hi>David,</hi> when the Lord had humbled him, and uſed afflictions for his ſinne, ſee how humbly and obediently he ſpeaks, <hi>If he ſay, he hath no delight in me, behold, here I am let him do what he pleaſeth,</hi> 2 Sam. 15.26. and the Church <hi>Mic.</hi> 7. <hi>I will hear the indignation of the Lord, becauſe I have ſinned againſt him</hi>; Nothing then will ſo humble and mollifie the heart to make a man do and be any thing, as a deep ſence of ſinne; Thus the cold, hard Iron is put into the fire, and it may be beaten into any ſhape.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>As the ſence of ſinne,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. The ſenſe of Gods mercy.</note> 
               <hi>ſo the ſence of Gods goodneſſe and grace in being reconciled, notwithſtanding all our provocations, doth much more enlarge the heart to thankefulneſſe and obedience; The love of Chriſt</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul) conſtraineth us,</hi> We cannot hold, we cannot keep in, as you may ſee <hi>David</hi> upon the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of Gods goodneſſe to him, reſolving <hi>to take the cup of ſalvation, and to praiſe God in the great Congregation,</hi> Pſa 116.13. Goſpel grace doth not in a filiall ſpirit harden and make wanton, but doth more ſoften and enflame to an active obedience; This made <hi>Paul</hi> run like the Sunne in the Firmament; You ſee it's the grace of God which lieth kindling and warming of him: This is like the Spirit in <hi>Ezechiels</hi> wheels, the dejected unbeleeving ſoul is not ſo readily obedient; An Evangelical frame of heart aſſured of Gods love, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth out to filiall fruitful obedience; Nothing is too much, too great, too dear to part with for ſo gracious a God; This breedeth love, and we know love is an active fire, it cannot lie ſtill, but kindleth all that it cometh near.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>They are active and willing becauſe of that ſanctified renewed nature which they are partakers of</hi>; They are ſaid to have <hi>the divine Nature,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.4.<note place="margin">3. The divine nature they are partakers of.</note> 
               <hi>The Seed of God</hi> is ſaid <hi>to abide in them,</hi> 1 Joh. 1.3. And by this means they are carried out voluntarily to divine actions, Thus in nature ſaith <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> which is the inward principle of motion or reſt; How readily do ſparks fly upward?
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:65216:119"/>
The ſtones deſcend downward? And thus it is here; Thoſe inward principles of Sanctification they do ſo new mold a man that now the will of God is his delight, the Law of God is written in the inward man; Nothing is ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural and ſutable to him as thoſe things that are alſo pleaſing to God; In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed for the unregenerated man it's no wonder he muſt be haled and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to what he doth, That he like the Mill cannot move any longer then the waters of affliction fall upon him, for there wants a principle within, but it is otherwiſe with thoſe that are born again; Their proper food, their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per delight, their all in all is to be doing the will of God, as Chriſt profeſſed, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. and <hi>David</hi> doth often acknowledge thoſe indeared affections he had to the Word of God above Kingdomes and all other earthly advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">4. Becauſe they were ſo wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling heretofore to ſin.</note>Fourthly, <hi>They are a willing people becauſe in their former time of unregenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy they were ſo willing and ready to ſerve ſin and Satan, and were conſtantly obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient thereunto</hi>; Now ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>As they had given themſelves ſervants to ſinne, ſo now to righteouſneſſe,</hi> Rom. 6.19. They readily ſet themſelves, as the word ſignifieth, whenſoever luſt bad them go, they did go; Whatſoever was commanded, there was ready obedience; This by way of an holy revenge, and to make a godly ſatisfaction, They are the more ſerviceable to God, They grudge the devil had ſo much time, that ſo much of their choiceſt and beſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections were leſſened in time; They therefore ſtrive to redeem the time, to recover all for God, They ſhame themſelves ſaying, What, was I willing and glad to doe the works of the devil, and ſhall I not doe the Will of God?</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">5. Becauſe they know none but willing ſervice is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted.</note>Fifthly, <hi>They are willing becauſe they know no Obedience is accepted of with God, unleſſe it be willing</hi>; It's not thy faith, thy humiliation, thy zeal, unleſſe there be willingneſſe and delight in it, that God accepts of, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.29. <hi>If ye be willing and obedient, ſo God accepts of a willing minde: Wo be to me</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul) if I preach the Goſpel, and not willingly but of conſtraint,</hi> 1 Cor. 9.6. Though he did preach it yet if not willingly there is a Woe to him; Oh then it's no wonder if the people of God are ſo glad and chearfull within them in the work of the Lord, otherwiſe their work would loſe their reward, and they the Crown of Glory; Think of this then when you finde the wheels of your Chariots move heavily, Thou art happily thinking how to put off truth or duty, or thou wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt it over, ſay this unwillingneſſe marreth all, God will not aceept of a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice unleſſe offered in fire: Say upon all thy dead and formal duties, theſe are not duties, God looks not upon them as ſo: <hi>Non operari &amp; non eſſe</hi> are all one before God in ſome reſpects.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">6. Becauſe of their great reward,</note>Sixthly, <hi>They muſt needs be a willing obedient people becauſe of that eternall glorious reward which is promiſed to every holy duty</hi>; What will put Wings to the ſoul if not this? To think that God will aſſuredly put upon thee Robes of Immortality and glory, for a duty though never ſo little, for a cup of cold water, who may not admire the vaſt diſproportion that is between our work and Gods reward; If the Apoſtle ſpake of the moſt extreme ſufferings that could be in this life, <hi>they were not worthy to be compared to that eternal weight of glory,</hi> 2 Cor. 4, 17. How much more is it true of thoſe good works we do, which are but little in quantity, and defiled in quality; Well therefore may they rejoyce and work righteouſneſſe, Well may the godly labour even in the heat of the day, with much gladneſſe of heart, for the recompence of thy reward doth exceed all proportion; If the Kingdomes of the world ſhould be given to a man for lifting up a ſtraw, it would not be ſo great a matter as when God and Heaven became thy reward for every holy duty: No wonder if they are beſt when they are thus doing; for how can they be better; There is no ſuch profitable and comfortable wotk as to be doing that of the Lords.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="207" facs="tcp:65216:119"/>Laſtly, <hi>Even in the very duty it ſelf though there were no heaven hereafter,</hi>

            <p>Laſtly, Here is the <hi>object</hi> of their Faith, <hi>viz.</hi> That Chriſt came from the Father, as ſent to be a Mediatour, working ſalvation for thoſe that did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him; They looked upon him, not only in reſpect of his perſon, <hi>God and man,</hi> but alſo in relation to his office, that he was the <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and the <hi>anointed one to ſave his people from their ſinnes</hi>; Whereas then we ſee our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our in many words commending this faith of theirs as a moſt ſpecial conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration in them, and which would be very acceptable to God, we may obſerve,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That Faith in Chriſt as a Mediatour is acceptable and well pleaſing as well as Obedience to a command</hi>; It's not Gods will that a childe of his ſhould be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies either thinking of ſinne or obedience, but alſo of beleeving or reſting the ſoul upon Chriſt, as in whom <hi>all fulneſſe</hi> is,<note place="margin">

Like that of the <hi>Canaanitiſh</hi> woman, whoſe faith Chriſt ſo commended, Though ſhe were put off and called <hi>dog,</hi> and told the bread did not belong to her, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.27. the promiſes of grace and pardon were not her due, yet for all that ſhe will hold upon Chriſt and not let him go; Oh then conſider that if thou like <hi>Peter</hi> wilt venture to go though upon the waters to him, here is a ſpecial diſcovery of the nobleneſſe of thy Faith; That thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardeſt Gods command and his promiſe more then all Satans temptations, and the ſence or ſuggeſtions of thy own ſoul; As it is with love to God when God doth afflict and chaſtiſe us, yet to keep up a tender fervent love to God argueth the greatneſſe and purity of thy love, ſo in the midſt of broken bones and trouble for ſinne to depend upon the grace of God in Chriſt argueth the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of Faith; Our Saviour when he ſaid, <hi>Bleſſed are they that beleeve and ſee

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> 2, Faith in Chriſt muſt be as acceptable as Obedience, becauſe <hi>there is great Obedience in Faith</hi>; For although Faith in Chriſt doth not juſtifie us as it's an Obediential act, for then we ſhould be juſtified by a work, but as it's an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument receiving the Righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, an hand to take that inrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Treaſure, yet there is very great Obedience in every act of beleeving, go over the ſeveral acts of it, knowledge, aſſent, and fiduciall application, all theſe are therefore put forth by a beleever, becauſe God ſaith it; Hence it's called the <hi>Obedience of faith,</hi> Rom. 10.26. And we are ſaid to <hi>captivate our underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> herein, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.5. For a man in beleeving walketh not by ſence or hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane reaſon, or principles of the world but the meer revealed will of God ſo that whether we regard the doctrine to be beleeved, or the promiſes to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced, we muſt conclude that faith is a ſpiritual Martyrdom; It's not reaſon but Gods Word moveth thee, as we told you in the Jews, <hi>They went about to eſtabliſh their own righteouſneſſe, and would not ſubmit themſelves to the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe by Chriſt,</hi> Rom. 10.3. You ſee by that expreſſien how a man muſt be much humbled and captivated ere he can yield up himſelf to Chriſts Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe; Oh then think not that Faith is not an high degree of Obedience; It's a renouncing of all humane thoughts, apprehenſions, and whatſoever ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing worth or righteouſneſſe may be in us: Oh how deeply was <hi>Paul</hi> humbled ere <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. he would come to <hi>account all things dung and droſſe, and to be found not having his own righteouſneſſe, but that which is by Faith in Chriſt</hi>; So that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Faith as it is a work doth not juſtifie, yet it's a great work and that of pure and meer obedience; For whereas in all other moral duties, <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Patience,</hi> there is ſome ingrafted notions within that convince of that; In be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving there is nothing but the command of God and his promiſe, that invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth to this duty.</p>

Oh that we could tell how to get this Ivy from cleaving thus to us, leſt it conſume all that is within us: Now the ready and onely way for a man to be driven out of this ſelf-righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is,</p>

            <p>MArvell not if I am the third time upon this Subject, for we ſee our Saviour doth again and again commend this Faith in his Diſciples, and certainly this is the Summe of the Goſpel, the marrow and quinteſſence of Chriſtianity; By this we differ from Jews, Pagans, and Turks, yea, by this we are ſeparated from Papiſts, Socinians, and other Hereticks, None of them allowing this imputed Righteouſneſſe by a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, which by Faith is to be received.</p>
            <p>Therefore I ſhall proceed in exalting and preſſing <hi>this Faith in a Mediator,</hi> that at laſt we may come to have a ſpirituall and ſound underſtanding herein; For here are two great ſtones to be rolled out of the way.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Ignorance</hi> or <hi>misbeleef</hi> in this Point; There are very few that have been Orthodox here; There are moſt in the world that have an erroneous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion in this matter, under the guilt of ſinne they do not fly only to Chriſt as a Mediatour; They ſay, <hi>Lo here is Chriſt</hi> and <hi>Lo there is Chriſt</hi>; They have ſomething elſe they put a confidence in, and therefore what the Lord ſaith in another caſe, is alſo true here, <hi>He will reject their confidence,</hi> Jer. 2.37. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver were the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> more prone to lean on <hi>Egipt</hi> and <hi>Aſſyria</hi> for outward help rather then on the Lord only, then we are in a ſpiritual man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ready to reſt upon ſome ſpirituall prop beſides the Lord Chriſt, ſo that ignorant people they know nothing of this, and knowing people are hardly perſwaded of the truth of it.</p>
            <p>A ſecond ſtone to be rolled out of the way, is that ſenſeleſneſſe and unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourineſſe on mens hearts, though it ſhould be granted that they know and rightly beleeve in this matter, for indeed none can prize or be affected with this Subject, but ſuch a ſpirituall heart that is ſenſible of his ſpiritual diſeaſe and the ſpiritual Remedy; They muſt be Children of the Adoption, They
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:65216:127"/>
muſt be Evangelical hearers, ſuch as have been in a ſpirituall Transfiguration with Chriſt on the Mount as it were, That are refreſhed with theſe Truths; It's not every hearer, It's not every one that cometh to the Aſſemblies that can ſay, <hi>How welcome are the feet of thoſe that bring glad tidings of the Goſpel:</hi> Therefore we deſire your hearts as well as your heads, your tender affections as well as ſolid underſtandings: This is a Truth that muſt be eaten, you will not feel the ſweetneſſe of it till it be in your belly.</p>
            <p>Now there are very good grounds why we ſhould be thus inſiſting upon this Subject.</p>
            <p>For 1. <hi>It's the main ſcope and end of the whole Scripture</hi>; If you ask why the Word of God was written, the Anſwer is, That the chief principal end was,<note place="margin">1. Faith in Chriſt the Mediatour the main ſcope of the Scripture.</note> that man being convinced of his ſinne and of the utter impotency of any righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe in himſelf or other Creatures, ſhould fly unto Chriſts Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe as the onely Sanctuary; Thus <hi>John, Theſe things are written that beleeving you might have eternal life,</hi> All the Adminiſtrations in the Old Teſtament were Types of Chriſt, as the Apoſtle in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> doth at large open their meaning; It was not their Sacrifices but Chriſt, It was not the <hi>bloud of Rams and Goats,</hi> but <hi>Chriſts bloud</hi>; Hence it's ſaid that <hi>Moſes and the Prophets bear witneſſe of Chriſt</hi>; It's true the Scripture hath many other ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate ends, but the chief is to direct us to Chriſt, to make us ſee that nothing in the world can pacifie God for our ſinnes but Chriſt; Oh then how neceſſary muſt that be which all the Penmen of the Scripture aimed at, <hi>Moſes, David,</hi> all the Prophets; They looked at this Meſſias; And the New Teſtament is wholly ſpent in deſcribing his perſon and his Office, or the end of his coming into the world; Oh then whatſoever thou maiſt be ignorant of or negligent in, yet give thy ſelf to the ſtudying, meditating, and beleeving of this Subject.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The great work of the Spirit of God in the Miniſtry is to convince of this Righteouſneſſe</hi>; It is to make us ſee that all humane Righteouſneſſe,<note place="margin">2. The work of the Spirit in the Miniſtry is to convince of ſin.</note> all mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral duties, no, nor the graces God beſtoweth on his people, are the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe God looks for, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.9, 10. <hi>The Spirit of God is there ſaid to reprove or convince the world of ſinne,</hi> eſpecially of that great ſinne of Unbelief, and then of <hi>Righteouſneſſe,</hi> which Chriſt procureth by going to his Father, Obſerve that, It's the work of Gods Spirit thus to convince, So that all Moral Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy and the wiſeſt directions of the moſt civil men will leave us in a Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; They cannot tell us what is true Righteouſneſſe, and how we come to be accepted of by God; Therefore this is revealed by the Goſpel only; If we would know what is that Righteouſneſſe which we may truſt to, which may be as a Skreen between Gods juſtice and us; Neither <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> nor <hi>Plato</hi> among the Heathens, no, nor <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and <hi>Suarez</hi> among the Papiſts will inform us rightly; Becauſe in the matter of Juſtification and the doctrine of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe they have too much conſulted with <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> as if the Scripture ſpake of ſuch a Righteouſneſſe as the Heathens do; No, this tels us, <hi>It's a Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of Chriſt imputed to us without works,</hi> this it doth again and again; Seeing then all natural reaſon would never perſwade us herein, it muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily be the Spirit of God that will convince us in this, and therefore though you hear ten thouſand Sermons of this Subject, your hearts will never be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of your own ſinfulneſſe and Chriſts Righteouſneſſe till you are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powerd by Gods Spirit; Oh then pray to God that he would make thy heart readily to yield to it, yea, and rejoyce in it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>The end of the Law and the preaching of that is wholly for this end,</hi>

            <p>IN this Verſe we ſee the End why Chriſt ſo largely commended the Faith and Obedience of his Diſciples; It is to ſhew that they were ſuch Subjects for whom his Praier was proper and peculiar: To have praied for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate, and ſuch who did not, nor ever would give themſelves up to Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience had been either to pray that God would alter his eternal purpoſe, or elſe the courſe of his juſtice, but ſeeing they were both given to him by the Father; and did really diſcover the Fruits of this gift in their lives, Therefore they were fit to be recommended in Praier.</p>
            <p>So that the Text doth deſcribe the Subjects of Chriſts Praier; And again, For whom he will not pray: It's like that terrible Separation of <hi>the Sheep on the right hand and the Goats on the left</hi>; It's <hi>horrenda Sententia,</hi> as one Divine cals it.

be abſolutely prohibitive; And ſo <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaid, that if we knew who had ſinned that unpardonable ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt, we were no more to pray for him, then for one damned in hell: Now whether ſuch a ſinne as is unto death be ordinarily committed, and what it is, and whether we may know when ſuch do commit it is worth the enquiring into, but is greatly extravagant unto my matter.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. <hi>To speak exactly, Gods Decree about Events is not the Rule of our Praier, but his Word is</hi>; And therefore though it ſhould be revealed that God would not do ſuch or ſuch things, yet it may be our duty to pray for them; As <hi>Austin</hi> inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth, If it ſhould be revealed that my Father muſt die of ſuch a diſeaſe, yet I might lawfully, though with ſubmiſſion, pray for his life, becauſe it's my duty to uſe all means for my Fathers Life; Thus though <hi>Nathan</hi> the Prophet had told <hi>David</hi> His Childe ſhould die, yet <hi>David</hi> humbleth himſelf, and by faſting ſeeketh to God for his Childes life; So it's lawfull to pray that God would wholly morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie ſinne in us, yet God will not do it in this life; Thus alſo though Chriſt told <hi>Peter</hi> he ſhould deny him, yet <hi>Peter</hi> was bound to pray for Faith and perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 4. <hi>We are to diſtinguiſh between a ſimple affection expreſſed conditionally in praier and an abſolute petition</hi>; It's lawfull even for all men, though reprobated, and <hi>formalitèr</hi> as ſo, to expreſſe our deſires and affections with this condition, if it were the Will of God; Even as Chriſt when he knew that it was Gods decree he ſhould ſuffer, and that he came into the world for that very hour, yet condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally he expreſſeth himſelf, <hi>If it be poſſible let this Cup paſſe away,</hi> Mat. 26.39. So ought we to expreſſe ſuch a deſire and love to the ſalvation of all men, that we are to wiſh it, but with ſubmiſſion to Gods Will and his glorious Wiſedom: Thus <hi>Paul</hi> conditionally expreſſed his deſire in reference to the ſalvation of his Nation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.3.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">III Whether we may pray in faith for others as for our ſelves.</note>Thirdly, <hi>It's debated, That although it be our duty to pray for others, yet whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we can pray in ſuch Faith for others as for our ſelves</hi>; Whether we may with as much confidence pour out our hearts for the neceſſities of another as for our ſelves, Some think not, becauſe we cannot have ſuch certain knowledge of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as of our ſelves, but the contrary is true, for ſeeing the Promiſe is Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, <hi>Whatſoever ye ſhall ask in my Name beleeving, ye ſhall receive,</hi> Matth. 21.22. And this extends to others as well as our ſelves; Therefore we may with as much Faith and Hope pray for others as for our ſelves, yea, it may be, and it's our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſometimes to think ſo, that God heareth our Praiers not ſo much for our ſakes as thoſe we pray for.</p>
            <p>Theſe things premiſed Let us conſider why it's ſo hopeful to pray for thoſe that are godly and belong to Chriſt.</p>
            <p>And firſt, <hi>Becauſe then our praiers are likelier to have a powerful effect</hi>; Now there is no man but heartily deſires his Praiers may proſper, he would not have them return empty into his own boſome;<note place="margin">Then our prayers are lik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier of a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful effect when we pray for the godly.</note> Theſe returns of Praier ſhould be more prized by us then the Merchant doth his Return of Ships, So that the godly man is very careful that he may not do any thing to blunt theſe Tools.</p>
            <p>Now there are theſe Grounds of more probable ſpeed,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. <hi>Becauſe Chriſt praieth for them,</hi> and how greatly ſhould we be encouraged to pray for thoſe, for whom Chriſt praieth; We ſee his Example in this Verſe: Now his Praier is a Mediatory Praier, a Praier that cannot but take effect; for the love of the Father doth not only move him, but Juſtice alſo, being he ſtands in the Relation of a Surety; Oh then let us be more fervent and conſtant in this duty of praying for others that are holy; Thou maiſt think with thy ſelf, What I am doing for him on Earth, Chriſt is doing for him in Heaven: Shall Chriſt regard the eſtate of ſuch an one, and ſhall I forget him? It's to be feared that the godly do not look upon this, as ſo neceſſary a duty, and certainly ſuch are the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentions
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:65216:131"/>
and alienations from one another, that I doubt this great duty of praier for one another is greatly neglected.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. <hi>Therefore it's like to be a speeding praier becauſe they are ſuch as are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Promiſe and Covenant</hi>; Now when we have a promiſe from Gods Word when he hath obliged his fidelity to ſuch, Then we have ſtrong Arguments to pleade for ſuch; Oh what a ſad diſheartening is it in praier to think, I pray for ſuch an one, but I know no promiſe to apply to him; It's true God is merciful and his goodneſſe that is a general Encouragement, but yet there muſt be ſome more peculiar Encouragements from the Word of God, to be hopefull in praier: Oh then be not guilty of the neglect of ſo much help and comfort to the Children of God, as to forget thy praiers for them, Thou maiſt urge the promiſes of God for them as well as for thy own ſelf.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. <hi>Therefore there is hope to ſpeed becauſe they are ſuch Subjects who deſire to walk in ſuch a way that they may put no ſtop to the proceedings of praier</hi>; One great and ſure deſtruction of all praier is to regard iniquity, when we pray yet to do alſo ſervice to ſinne; <hi>If I regard iniquity in my heart the Lord will not hear my praiers,</hi> ſaith <hi>David</hi>; Pſal. 66.18. And again, <hi>I will waſh my hands in innocency ſo will I compaſſe thy Altar,</hi> Pſal. 26.6. He that praieth and yet is given to ſin doth <hi>benedicere Linguâ,</hi> but <hi>maledicere Vitâ</hi>; As the ſtrings of an Inſtrument that are moiſtned are not fit for any Muſick, ſo neither is that mans heart or life which is polluted with any foul and noiſome luſt; If therefore thou praieſt for the godly they are ſuch who labour to keep hearts and lives pure; And therefore the benefit of praier will finde no gulf to ſtop it: It encourageth the Phyſician to give Phyſick to him who by his diſorderly diet and Converſation will not go about to marre and deſtroy all.</p>
            <p n="4">4. There is hope to ſpeed in praying for a godly man, becauſe there is a good Foundation already laid by God; God hath begun with many hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful diſpenſations to thoſe that are his, and we may not think he will have the reproach of the unwiſe Builder that began to build and could not make an end; Thus the Apoſtle encouraged himſelf, <hi>The Lord hath delivered and will deliver from every evil work,</hi> 2 Tim. 4.17. Let therefore the gracious workings of God upon thoſe that are his people, be ſo many ſtrong Invitations to pour out thy praiers for them.</p>
            <p>But you will ſay,<note place="margin">Of praying for ungodly men.</note> May we then onely pray for thoſe that are already godly, muſt we like the Prieſt and the Levite paſſe by all wicked men? God forbid; Though there be not ſuch comfort and hope in praying for them, yet it's our duty, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.7. to pray for <hi>all men</hi>:<note place="margin">Motives there unto.</note> There are no ſorts of perſons excepted but ſuch as have ſinned that ſinne unto death; Indeed God is angry with <hi>Samuel</hi> for praying any more for <hi>Saul,</hi> and God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands <hi>Jeremiah</hi> to pray no more for that people, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 7.6. but that was chiefly in reſpect of temporall Mercies, <hi>Saul</hi> to have his Kingdome ſtill; The People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to have their Judgements removed, but that could not be, God had determined otherwiſe; It's our duty to pray for the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked though wallowing in their ſinnes, that they may be converted and brought home to God; Thus Chriſt that would not pray for the world of the Reprobates, yet praied for wicked men, <hi>That God would forgive them for they knew not what they did</hi>; And ſeeing that Chriſt was heard in what he praied for, we may think all thoſe were converted; Thoſe that knew not what they did, that were ignorant in their crucifying Chriſt, or if not all yet many, for our Saviour ſpake indefinitely not univerſally: Thus <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> converted <hi>Paul</hi> by his Praier at the hour of his Martyrdome; So <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nica</hi> the Mother of <hi>Auſtin,</hi> by her daily praiers was a means of converting
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:65216:132"/>
               <hi>Auſtin,</hi> So that we may ſay of the ungodly as <hi>Samuel</hi> concerning the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> though a ſtubborn and wicked Nation, <hi>God forbid I ſhould ceaſe to pray for you,</hi> And indeed if it be our duty to admoniſh and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort others, and with much patience to endure, if it be poſſible to bring them out of the ſnares of ſinne, no doubt we are to pray that God would bleſſe ſuch Reproofs, That he would prepare the heart to receive them; And again the very miſerable and wretched eſtate they are in through ſinne makes them fit Objects of praier: There is never a prophane man that wallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in his luſts, bleſſing himſelf in his hearts deſire, but he is an Object of great pity, Even as mad men that think themſelves Great Perſons, when they are bound up in chains; Seeing therefore they lie under ſuch great miſery and they feel not this, They pity not, nor pray for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; This ſhould make us that can pray to commend their eſtate to God; And the rather becauſe as Preaching of the Word, ſo Praier is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed as a means of Converſion, but by the Word: Ask, and ye ſhall receive; So that if I ask for Converſion, If I pray for the Reformation of another, my praier may be the Execution of Gods Election; It's by praier that God will make good this promiſe; Oh how comfortable will it be to ſee thee a Father anſwered in praier for the converſion of thy Children, That they are the Fruit of thy Praiers, So likewiſe what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing is it to a Miniſter, when not onely his preaching but his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for his people is anſwered; That it is not all our duty to preach to you but pray for you as Chriſt did; And what a joy is it if we ſee God anſwering our praiers in the converſion and reforming of one man; It's true there are ſome wicked men ſo highly prophane and ſo wilfully wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked that they greatly cool the heart of a godly man in Praier: It's ſaid, the Church ſhut <hi>Julian</hi> out of her praiers, and there could not a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and more ſorer judgement befall him, for that was <hi>futuri judicii preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicium.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. Is Praier thus hopefull in the behalf of the godly? <hi>then this ſhould teach the godly to be more fervent and conſtant in this duty for one another: Paul</hi> though ſo eminent in office and graces, yet again and again deſireth the Churches praiers and he promiſeth his praiers for them; He informeth <hi>Philemon</hi> in particular that he makes mention of him in his praiers al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies; Thus you ſee what the godly have been uſed to do, If <hi>David</hi> Pſal. 119.4, when his Enemies reviled him and reproached him, yet he gave himſelf to Praier, and humbled himſelf in Sackcloth for them, what then would he do for thoſe that were godly, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 72. It's made a great bleſſing unto <hi>Solomon,</hi> that praier ſhall be made for him, and the fervent Praier of a righteous man prevaileth much, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.16. If ſo, why do we not ſtir up our ſelves more to this duty; The Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> biddeth us confeſſe our ſinnes and pray for one another in the ſame place; Shall Chriſt pray for all his, and wilt not thou? Do not ſay It's enough to pray in the general for Gods Church, but thou art in particular to pray for others as their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions and neceſſities require, be moved hereunto.</p>
            <p>Firſt, From the common body and fellowſhip that ye are in; The Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture delights to reſemble the Communion of the Church under the ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of a body, to ſhew how near and conjoyned they are together; If one member ſuffer ſhall not the Tongue pray for it; If any part of thy own bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy be pained and grieved, how much doth it affect thee, thou ſhouldſt have the ſame affections to thoſe that are of the body of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Praiers are an inſtituted help and means to procure the good of others, ſo that it's a duty you owe, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.19 <hi>Paul</hi> truſted that all the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition he had would turn to good by their praiers; So then, the afflictions,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:65216:132"/>
the mercies that others are under prove good by Praier: Oh how apt is one to conſume another! They are proud under ſuch mercies, They are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient under ſuch afflictions, but thou that art thus apt to finde fault, doſt thou or haſt thou praied for them? It may be they are no better becauſe thou haſt not done thy duty: Thou little thinkeſt how near their ſinnes may come to thee, Not that we are bound to mention by Name every godly man, for that is infinite, but as occaſion draweth thee out, and thou art deſired, making as much Conſcience of praier for others as a debt thou oweſt, or as a pledge thou art to reſtore.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Fervent Praier for one another will take away all differences, all jealouſies and ſuſpicions, it will make the Godly of one heart and one minde: Oh who can bewail the diviſions of <hi>Jacob,</hi> Not the garments but the body of Chriſt is now rent: In former times it was ſaid, Behold, how they love one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, how they call one another Brethren, but now what differences in opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and other carnal contentions: There is no Love and communion, and there is no greater cauſe then neglect of this duty, and it's alſo an excellent remedy againſt all diſcontents: Art thou apt to receive unkindneſſes, To think this or that hard dealing, Go and pray for that man, Oh how immediatly will it quiet thoſe windes and waves.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> of Admonition To wicked men, to avoid all impiety, if not for other Reaſons yet for this, it makes other mens praiers the leſſe effectuall; It may be though thou art ſo vile and naught, thou haſt a godly Father, or a godly Friend praying for thee; Though thou art ſo ungodly, thou haſt a godly Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter praying for thee: Oh do not raiſe ſo great a gulf between Heaven and their praiers, as thy ſinnes are; When <hi>Lazarus</hi> was dead and buried in the grave, <hi>Mary</hi> giveth it over as a deſperate caſe: If thou hadſt been here he had not died, ſaith ſhe: So are we apt to ſay, Lord, Praier for ſuch before they come to be thus obſtinate, before they bave rebelled ſo much againſt the Light, might have been hopeful; But now what hope is there? Take heed thou go not ſo far in ſinning that God ſaith, Pray no more for this man.</p>

Thoſe who for the preſent are in a ſtate of ſinne and oppoſition to Chriſt, and are called Sheep only in reſpect of Gods purpoſe and Election, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.16. <hi>Other Sheep I have that are not of this Fold,</hi> Them alſo I muſt bring and they ſhall hear my voice; Theſe are under Chriſtt Mediatory Praier, for it is by vertue of his Mediation that they are brought home unto him, but then there are others who are actually put into a poſſeſſion of Chriſt, having new Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,<note place="margin">The Children of God are of two ſorts.</note> and ſo enjoying a Title and Right to him; Theſe are much more under the Mediatory power of Chriſts Praier, And therefore of ſuch I ſhall treat.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> Again Conſider, <hi>That though Chriſt praied on Earth as a Mediatour, yet ſtill he doth in Heaven make Interceſſion for his</hi>: He ceaſeth not praying though the manner be different; His praier while in his humiliation is accompanied with ſtrong crys and tears, with much humility and debaſement, but his praier in his Exaltation is only a repreſenting of thoſe to God whom he died far, as alſo their condition and neceſſity, willing that what he had purchaſed for them ſhould be actually applied to them; Hence in the Text it is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; A Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man obſerveth that that word is only applied to the Praiers of Chriſt in his humiliation, and <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> to his Interceſſion, which he makes in heaven, ſo that though Chriſt be now in heaven, yet we may not think he hath laid aſide thoſe compaſſionate bowels he had toward us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.15. when he was on the earth.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> Thirdly, Take notice that as there was a Typical High-Prieſt in the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, who offered Sacrifices and praied for the people, carrying on his Breaſt the Names of the Twelve Tribes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that thereby they might be in a continual memory as it were before God, So <hi>under the New Teſtament
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:65216:133"/>
Chriſt is the ſubſtance of that ſhadow, and he is the reall High-Prieſt,</hi> who not only once offered up himſelf a perfect Sacrifice for ſinne, but was earneſt in Praier for his people;</p>
            <p>Now it's comfortable to conſider in how many reſpects Chriſt is preferred by the Apoſtle <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. <hi>&amp; alibi</hi> above him in the Law.<note place="margin">The Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of Chriſt exceeds the Prieſthood of the Law.</note>

            <p n="2">2. <hi>All other High Prieſts had ſinnes of their own to offer for as well as others, v.</hi> 27. <hi>They were compaſſed about with infirmities</hi> as well as other men, but Chriſt who praieth for us is <hi>holy, harmleſſe, undefiled, and ſeparate from ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> ſo that Chriſt had no ſinne of his own to purge away, he offered not up a Sacrifice for any infirmity he had, but it was for the ſinnes of thoſe who are his Childrin; Therefore the people of God are in a tranſcendent bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe by reaſon of this Mediatory Interceſſion.</p>

But the Lord Chriſt is alwaies attending and min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding this very thing; Oh the unſearchable depths of comfort that are in this, when thou art preaching, drinking, working, then Chriſt is interceding for thee, when thou haſt no minde of thy ſelf, doſt not pray for thy ſelf, yet even then Chriſt is commending thy caſe to his Father: Oh the godly ſoul ſhould cry out, I have enough, what can I deſire more?

And then 2. Becauſe of Love, For he is the only begotten Sonne and welbeloved of his Father: The prevalency of Chriſts Mediatory Praier is ſeen both for impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration and application, for as it is with his oblation of himſelf, ſo it is with his Interceſſion.</p>

and indeed had it not been for this his Mediatory power, there had been no ſuch things <hi>in rerum naturâ,</hi> Reconciliation and Peace with God had been a meer <hi>Ens rationis,</hi> men might have imagined ſuch a thing as they may golden Mountains, but there had been no exiſtency of them, ſo that it was of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite concernment to Beleevers, to obtain of God, that there might be ſuch priviledges, They coſt him dear; It was not only <hi>praiers with tears,</hi> but with <hi>bloud</hi> alſo, but Impetration is not enough, for if it had been as Arminians ſay, That Chriſt as Mediatour obtained only a poſſibility of Salvation, or made a way for ſuch mercies, but then the application to ariſe partly from mans free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will and power; This would be to hold <hi>That Chriſt might have died in vain,</hi> That notwithſtanding all that love of God ſending his Sonne into the world, and all the wrath that he did undergo, <hi>Not one man might have been ſaved</hi>: This muſt needs be very derogatory both to the Father and to the Sonne, but Chriſts Praier is for the <hi>application and actual beſtowing of all thoſe benefits he hath obtained,</hi> and for this end <hi>he ſends his Spirit into our hearts,</hi> Rom. 8 and that is a <hi>Spirit of praier and ſupplication</hi>: So that we have a twofold bottome to ſtand upon, Chriſts Praiers and the Spirits Interceſſion in us; Oh the ſtrong Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations that may be received hence! for the godly ſoul may think, Though Chriſts praier be prevalent, yet I muſt pray alſo; He that asketh not ſhall not receive: Now my praiers are weak, dull, ſinfull; See therefore the goodneſſe of Chriſt that gives his Spirit to us, to help us againſt all the Infirmities of our praiers, both to know what to pray and how to pray; It's not then enough to hear that Chriſt by his Praier doth obtain all good things at Gods hand, unleſs he vouchſafe them to us, and make us partaker of them.

As pardon of ſinne <hi>ſo power againſt ſinne under the urgent and important temptations thereunto</hi>; Oh this is of admirable concernment, That when thou art even eating poiſon, when thou art within the hot flames of ſinne, yet to be preſerved; This is ſo great a matter that we are taught conſtantly to pray <hi>that we may not be led into temptation</hi>; What ſad bruiſes and wounds have the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly got to themſelves in a temptation; Thou little knoweſt what thou maiſt be

and do, even the moſt abominable things that are if left to a Temptation; Now this is a ſpecial thing in Chriſts praier to have preſent help of grace in ſuch a ſtreight: Thus <hi>v.</hi> 15. <hi>I pray that thou ſhouldſt keep them from the evil of the world</hi>; Not to be taken out of the world but to be preſerved from the ſinfulneſſe of it; and thus for <hi>Peter,</hi> Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Satan had a deſire to winnow him, but he praied that his faith might not fail,</hi> Luk. 22.32. Had not the fruit of this praier in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervened <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Judas</hi> might have been both alike: Oh then the tender godly man that is obnoxious to over-whelming fears, if ſuch and ſuch temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations ſhould befall him, he ſhould be undone that ſaith one time or other this or that affliction will break him; Let ſuch conſider that it's not their ſtrength but Chriſts praier is their ſupport, he that praied <hi>Peters</hi> faith might not fail hath done the like for thee.</p>

Therefore to hold univerſal grace or redemption is nothing ſo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing as to hold univerſal Salvation; Alas, though men hold Chriſt died for all, yet they grant the moſt of them are damned; Therefore that doctrine is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo deſirable as that which maintains the ſalvation of all; If then you ſay that is too broad a way the Scripture gainſays that; Thus it followeth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, If the Scripture gainſay the other we are to attend to what that ſaith, and not to what our own hearts would have; Therefore throw away the head of the Sacrifice as God commanded, all thy own thoughts and natural Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in this matter.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>It cannot be denied but that the Scripture when it mentioneth the Subject for whom Chriſt died, ſpeaks indefinitely of all; As all died by Adam,</hi>

Upon Chriſts death we are juſtified and ſaved, and above all in this Chapter we ſee Chriſt often and often again reſtraining all his praier and Mediation to <hi>thoſe that the Father had given him</hi>; If he would not pour out a praier, will he pour out his bloud? If he would not ſhed a tear, will he ſhed his bloud for them? So that if we will keep up other places with this, we muſt needs ſay, That Chriſt died for all inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely not univerſally; Even as when we have to do with the <hi>Anthropomor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phites, Thoſe that held God is a body</hi>: We grant that there are innumerable pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Scripture which ſpeak of Gods eyes, arms, and his hands, yet we ſay that Scripture may not oppoſe Scripture; There are other places though few which deſcribe him to be a Spirit, therefore we are neceſſitated to ſay the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture ſpeaks ſo to our condeſcenſion, thus it is here: Though many places of Scripture ſpeak of Chriſts death in ſuch an univerſal ſence, yet other places do plainly limit is to certain perſons who are Elected and given by the Father to Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2.

            <p>Laſtly, <hi>We are neceſſitated to limit ſuch phraſes becauſe of experience</hi>; For if Chriſt died for all men intentionally, how is it that in the Old Teſtament ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting ſome few Proſelites, the offer of grace was onely to ſome few, and though ſince Chriſts time the Goſpel be ſaid to be preached to every creature, yet how many Nations and much more particular perſons have there been to whom Chriſt with his benefits have never been offered; Now who can ſay that Chriſt died for thoſe to whom he never diſcovered ſo much as the very Name of his death; It's true, this ſhould make us adore the goodneſſe of God that gives us to live where this Goſpel-grace is plentifully offered, What are we more then all thoſe Heathens and Pagans who ſit in darkneſſe and have no light, who never heard of a Mediatour, but oh wretched and miſerable if we neglect ſo great ſalvation.</p>

               </gap>; See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that God ſo loved the nature of mankinde that he gave his Son, for thoſe that ſhould beleeve in him, paſſing by innumerable Angels who might have done him more ſervice, It might well be ſaid that Chriſt gave himſelf for the ſins of the world, <hi>viz. men</hi> the Inhabitants thereof.</p>

not call one Nation more then another; Neither are means of Salvation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed in one Countrey more then another; It may very well be called the whole world that Chriſt died for, for commonly the Scripture comprehends all the men of the world under this diviſion, the Jew and the Gentile; Hence there is that command, <hi>Go preach the Goſpel to every Creature,</hi> that is to Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles as well as Jews, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. and certainly this ſeemeth to be the moſt genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine Reaſon why the Scripture ſpeaks thus univerſally about Chriſts death.

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. <hi>As it's uſed in oppoſition to the Jews, ſo alſo to abate and confound the pride of the Iews,</hi> who becauſe the Meſſias was to come of them were apt to be puffed up with this priviledge, and to envy or murmure that the Gentiles ſhould be made partaker of this grace; This our Saviour repreſented under the Parable of the Prodigal Son entertained at a Feaſt, and the elder Brother murmuring at it, <hi>Luk.</hi> 15.30. We ſee how hard a thing it was to bring the Jew off from thoſe priviledges he enjoyed, and the Righteouſneſſe of the Law, ſo as to be beholding to Chriſts Righteouſneſſe only.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 4. <hi>This might be becauſe when Christ came into the world few of the Iews were converted to Chriſt comparatively to the Gentiles</hi>; For <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. you ſee the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeaking of a <hi>Veil upon their eyes,</hi> and that <hi>hardneſſe of heart was come upon Iſrael,</hi> and thoſe former branches are ſaid to be broken off, that new ones may be grafted in; Therefore it might well be ſaid That Chriſt died for all, and that he was a propitiation for the ſinnes of the whole world, becauſe the Nations of the world of all parts did now come in and worſhip Chriſt; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as few of the Jews did receive him; Therefore conſider the time when thoſe paſſages were written, and then you will eaſily underſtand thoſe Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> 5. Therefore the Scripture doth thus make an univerſal Propoſition and Oblation of Chriſts death in the benefits of it, becauſe <hi>now no Nations or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſons are excluded,</hi> For although there be an Election of ſome onely, and Chriſt had a ſpecial love in his death only to thoſe that the Father had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him, yet becauſe who theſe individual perſons are is not manifeſted by God; Therefore the outward propounding of it is univerſall, not excluding any, Thus all the Invitations and commands are univerſal; Chriſt cals <hi>all that are heavy laden,</hi> all that <hi>thirſt to come unto him</hi>; And although it he true that many even where the Goſpel is preached, are given up to blinde eyes and hard hearts: That the Goſpel of Chriſt is <hi>a ſavour of death unto many,</hi> yet we not knowing who are thus inwardly withered and curſed, are to hope that to all thoſe to whom the offer of the benefits of Chriſts death extends, even to them the death of Chriſt it ſelf reacheth, and this may be thought the main reaſon why the Scripture uſeth ſuch expreſſions about Chriſts death.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> 6. It may uſe ſuch expreſſions, For although the greater part of the world are ſuch that periſh, and <hi>Many are called but few are choſen,</hi> Mat. 22. yet if we judge of thoſe for whom Chriſt died abſolutely in themſelves, <hi>they ariſe to a great number</hi>: So that as <hi>Auſtin</hi> made two Cities, the one of good Men and Angels built by God, the other of wicked men and devils, whoſe authour is the devil: Thus according to the Scripture we may divide the world into two worlds, the world of thoſe that are to periſh, and the world of thoſe that are to be ſaved; The former is the greater part, the latter the better part, yet this better part is very numerous, as appeareth by the many thouſands in the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation</hi> that are ſaid to be ſealed, ſo that we may not wonder if it be ſaid Chriſt died for the world, ſeeing the number of thoſe he died for in all Ages have been ſo many.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="239" facs="tcp:65216:139"/>Laſtly, No wonder if the Scripture uſeth ſuch an indefinite expreſſion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>we ſee it doth in other things alſo,</hi> when yet there is an acknowledged ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity by all that it might be reſtrained, and ſpeaking of Chriſt it's ſaid, <hi>All fleſh ſhall ſee the Salvation of God,</hi> Luk. 3.6. Now it's confirmed by experience that there were many in Chriſts time who yet did not ſee him either bodily or ſpiritually: Thus <hi>Act.</hi> 2. <hi>I will powr my Spirit upon all fleſh, and their Sons and Daughters ſhall propheſie,</hi> when yet all know they were but ſome that had thoſe extraordinary gifts, eſpecially that famous Promiſe, <hi>That all Nations of the earth ſhould be bleſſed in Abraham</hi> is clear for our purpoſe; For the Apoſtle <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. doth plainly limit it to the <hi>ſpirituall Seed of Abraham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus you ſee that it's no new thing to uſe expreſſions of univerſality, when yet there is a neceſſity of reſtraining their ſence; We might alſo adde thoſe places, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and all <hi>Iudea</hi> are ſaid to go to Chriſt, and <hi>Mat.</hi> 9. <hi>the whole City is ſaid to meet Ieſus,</hi> yea, <hi>all the world is ſaid to run after him</hi>; Therefore it's not the meer bare words but the coherence and other places muſt direct us herein.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Although we cannot ſay Chriſt had a ſpecial love intending his Death a ranſome for all and every one, yet it's very plain,<note place="margin">II. Reprobates re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive much benefit by Chriſts death.</note> 
               <hi>that even the Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates and thoſe who for their ſinnes are eternally condemned do receive much good and benefit by his death</hi>; Indeed in ſome reſpects their condemnation is the greater, but that is their own ſinne who wilfully refuſe him, and will not have him to be their Lord and King, as <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. <hi>This is the condemnation that Light is come into the world, and men love darkneſſe rather then Light</hi>; And again, <hi>If I had not come unto them they had had no ſinne,</hi> Joh. 15.22. So that all thoſe who live under Chriſts gracious offer, as their ſinne is greater ſo their condemnation will be greater, it being better for them, if there never had been a Chriſt, or that he had not been crucified: Though mens voluntary wickedneſſe make it thus, yet <hi>ſeveral mercies do redound even to the Reprobate by Chriſts death.</hi>

deſired to hear of Chriſt, he began firſt with <hi>temperance,</hi> and <hi>righteouſneſſe,</hi> and <hi>the world to come; Felix</hi> being guilty of Injuſtice and unchaſte courſes; <hi>Paul</hi> preacheth about thoſe ſinnes and hell, laying open the wrath of God, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that he made <hi>Felix</hi> to tremble, ſo that <hi>Chriſt muſt have a way made for him; The mountains muſt be laid low, and the valleys exalted, and all fleſh muſt be convinced to be graſſe</hi>; Before Chriſt can be entertained this ought to be our Method; To men plunged in ſinne we are to diſcover unto them the wrath and anger of God, all the curſes that are due to him who breaks the Law in the leaſt iota; To make men ſee their poverty and miſery, and when men are thus prepared and humbled, then we exalt the brazen Serpent, ſo that by Chriſts death the Miniſters Commiſſion is greatly enlarged and made more ample then in the Jewiſh adminiſtration.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Even Reprobates have this advantage by Chriſt that they enjoy all the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies they have</hi>; That they have health, wealth, and the comforts of this world; For ſeeing that by <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne all was forfeited, and a curſe come upon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing, now by Chriſt who is the heir of all things they come lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to enjoy the mercies they have, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. It is Chriſt that <hi>beareth up the world,</hi> if he did withhold his arm the whole world would fall into rubbiſh; It's true indeed if we ſpeak of a ſanctified uſe, ſo wicked men have none of the comforts they enjoy, but being impure all things are impure to them, ſo that the curſe of the Law is not taken off from them, becauſe they are not yet in Chriſt, otherwiſe they have a lawfull right before God and man to the comforts they enjoy, for that is not to be received though many pious men have preached it, that wicked men have no right to the goods they have, but are as Theeves and Robbers, and ſhall anſwer for every bitt of bread they eat as Uſurpers; This is againſt the Scripture which ſaith, <hi>God hath given the Earth to the Inhabitants thereof,</hi> Pſal. 115.8. And that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſteal</hi> doth make it evident, that both by Gods Law and mans Law what wicked men have in Righteous waies they are true and lawfull Poſſeſſors of, and this, ſay Divines, cometh by Chriſt, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored the Forfeit, <hi>Adam</hi> made, elſe the world would not have ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a moment: Although it muſt be granted that ſome Learned men at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute the enjoyment of Comforts which the ungodly have, not to Chriſt, but to the patient Providence of God, whereby he doth not take the preſent Forfeiture; But may not this Patience of God be attributed to Chriſts death ſeeing he did not uſe any ſuch to the Apoſtate Angels, but they were immediately chained up in the cloſe Priſon of utter dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>It is by Chriſts Death, That many unregenerated men are partakers of the common gifts of Gods Spirit</hi>; There are many that live within the Church of God, though not regenerated, yet have great gifts and abilities, They have many admirable endowments; Now how come theſe but by Chriſt, as <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.

            <p>Yea Laſtly, <hi>Chriſt by his Death is made Lord of the whole world</hi>; And hath conquered all the Inhabitants that are therein, So that they are <hi>Chriſts as a Lord that bought them by his Death</hi>; Thus that place is to be underſtood, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.1. ſpeaking of ungodly men whoſe damnation would ſwiftly come upon them, for the damnable hereſies they brought in; It's ſaid, <hi>They denied the Lord that bought them,</hi>

            <p>We come to a ſecond deſcription of thoſe that are included in Chriſts Praier, and they are characterized by this, <hi>They are given by the Father to Chriſt</hi>; Certainly there muſt be much in this Conſideration; For our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our doth no leſſe then five times uſe it in this Praier, and <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. it's uſed ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall times.</p>
            <p>I handled it before but then I conſidered it much as it did imply the truſt and charge Chriſt had by this gift: God the Father gave them to Chriſt as a faithful Mediatour, he betruſted him with them as a people whoſe Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he ſhould obtain, and accordingly Chriſt was faithfull to make theſe a peculiar people and Gods precious Jewels; They were given him as a King to govern, as a Phyſician to heal, as a Mediatour to ſave, and as a Shepherd to feed, and this propriety that both God and Chriſt hath in them is a great ground why God ſhould hear Chriſts Praier for them.</p>
            <p>But I ſhall now conſider this phraſe, <hi>as it tels us the manner how they were made Chriſts,</hi> and that is by <hi>meer gift</hi> and <hi>grace</hi>; God did not ſee or foreſee any merits or works in thoſe Diſciples more then others, for all are alike cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted in that common maſſe of mankinde, but it was his meer and ſole good pleaſure, For <hi>Gratia non eſt gratia ullo modo, niſi ſit gratuiha omni modo</hi>; We ſee then here what is the womb that firſt giveth a being to all thoſe thar are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and that is <hi>Gods grace in giving ſome to Chriſt</hi>; Now what is meant by this giving to Chriſt; It cannot be any other thing but Gods Predeſtination and Election of ſome with the neceſſary effects of it in time, as Vocation, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It's a phraſe that is like an hard ſtone to the Arminians teeth, it troubleth them exceedingly, and therefore ſee what violence they offer to this phraſe; By this giving to Chriſt is meant ſay they, <hi>the diſpoſition and ready Obedience which ſome give to Gods call</hi>; O monſtrous Tranſubſtantiation, like that of the Papiſts of the bread into Chriſts body; For that which the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture giveth expreſly to God they take away and give to man; The Scripture ſaith, God giveth them, and they ſay man giveth himſelf; We ſee that not
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:65216:145"/>
only the ignorant and unlearned but even learned men corrupted may wreſt the Scripture to their deſtruction; But to diſcover this Interpretation is refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation enough; Indeed it cannot be denied but that in this Chapter there is a twofold giving of ſome to Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By <hi>Election</hi> and Sanctification to Eternal Life.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>A peculiar ſegregation</hi> or deſtination to ſome Office; Of this latter our Saviour ſpeaks afterwards, ſay ſome, when he ſaid, <hi>None had periſhed of thoſe whom the Father had given him but the Son of Perdition</hi>; But of the former he ſpeaks <hi>v.</hi> 2. <hi>He giveth Eternall Life to every one that was given him,</hi> and <hi>v.</hi> 9. They were given him <hi>out of the world,</hi> wheras <hi>Judas</hi> was alwaies <hi>of the world,</hi> and thus it is taken here; So that to be given by Chriſt is for the <hi>Father freely out of his meer good pleaſure to chooſe ſome in Chriſt to Eternall Life, ſanctifying and calling of them in time,</hi> So that the Fountain of all the good we have is the meer grace and love of God; The diſcriminating difference why Chriſt prayeth not for the world but his Diſciples, and in them all beleevers, is not from any good or worth in them, but meerly from the meer gift of God.</p>

            <p>THis is the third and laſt deſcription which our Saviour uſeth of thoſe who are the objects of his praier, <hi>viz.</hi> The propriety that God hath in them, <hi>They are his own.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have handled this Point formerly, but then I did it under an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute notion, ſhewing you how many waies the people of God were his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but I ſhall now treat on it relatively, as it's an Argument uſed by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour why he ſhould be heard in his praier for his Diſciples; And certainly here is much of ſtrength in it, <hi>They are thine,</hi> I pray not for thy Enemies nor for ſtrangers, but ſuch as are near thee, that are of thy own houſhold, ſuch upon whom already thou haſt placed thy love and delight,<note place="margin">Of Gods pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple as the ground of Chriſts praier for them, care of them, and of all the good that accrueth unto them.</note> ſo that our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our makes the propriety God hath in his Diſciples, and ſo in all beleevers, to be the ground of his praier for them; And indeed this muſt needs be very ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual, for the Apoſtle argueth, <hi>If any man provide not for his own,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.0. <hi>he is worſe then an Infidell</hi>; If then God doth ſo greatly abhor him who takes not care for his own, Shall not the Lord himſelf provide for his? Thus <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.29. the Apoſtle urging the duty of Husbands to Wives argueth from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, <hi>Their own Wives; and no man ever hated his own fleſh</hi>; Now then God takes this relation of an Husband to his people, and becauſe they are his there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he will hear their praier, and vouchſafe all good to them; Propriety is ſo great a matter that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> makes it the cauſe of all the labour and trading that is in the world, inſomuch that he ſaith, If all things were common the world would be filled with idle perſons, but becauſe it's their own ground, their own wealth, their own riches, therefore they are ſo diligent to encreaſe in theſe things: None regard the air, the light of the Sun becauſe it's common to all, Whereas if they could be appropriated, if no man had the light of the Sun but one or few men, Oh what a price would be put upon it; It's then proptiety both with God and man that is the Fountain of all good, of all care,<note place="margin">Propoſitions concerning Gods peculiar propriety in his people.</note> and brings about all the bleſſedneſſe that Gods Children have.</p>
            <p>To open this Point, and not to fall in with what you have heard al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Take notice <hi>That a people becomes the Lords peculiar ones, his Jewels, ſolely by his grace and goodwill; He hath choſen us, and not we him, he loved us first</hi>:<note place="margin">1. A people be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Gods peculiar ones freely by grace</note> The great God of heaven who might have made other people, other perſons his treaſure, did out of his own meer goodneſſe take thee and thee into ſuch a bleſſed relation: The Apoſtle doth every where in his Epiſtles reduce it to
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:65216:148"/>
this cauſe, <hi>The counſell of his will,</hi> and out of his meer grace, and certainly if <hi>Deut.</hi> 9.5. the Lord doth again and again inform the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> that it was not for their righteouſneſſe, or any good in them but meerly becauſe be ſet his love on them, that he made them his externall people by an outward Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; how much rather muſt it needs be the meer grace of God to make a people inwardly and ſpiritually his, ſo that whoſoever finde themſelves thus appropriated to God, to be able with the Church to ſay as ſhe doth many times, becauſe our bleſſedneſſe lieth in this, <hi>I am my well-beloveds, and my well-beloved is mine,</hi> Cant. 6.3. Oh let ſuch be deeply humbled and even aſtoniſhed under the diſcriminating Grace of God, I am the Lords when the devils are not, when ſuch men of parts, abilities, and great Revenues in the world; And if the Lord would have looked to any thing in man, how many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands are there that if converted would have been more glorious Inſtruments of Gods glory then I am.</p>

And from his meer goodneſs not out of any want.</note>2. <hi>As it is the meer goodneſſe of God to make a people his, ſo it is not out of any want or any neceſſity, any need that he hath of us,</hi> that he did thus make us his, and this alſo is a quickning conſideration; Husbands have Wives be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they want ſuch helps, Maſters have Servants becauſe they need them; Even the greateſt Monarchs want their people; But it is otherwiſe with God, <hi>My goodneſſe extends not to thee,</hi> ſaith <hi>David,</hi> Pſa. 16.2. And thus <hi>Job</hi> was told, that if he were perfect and righteous he did not advantage God, God is the <hi>Elſhaddai</hi> the Allſufficient God bleſſed and happy enough in himſelf; Though he had never created the world, Though he had not appointed one man to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal glory, yet ſuch was his goodneſſe that he would have thoſe Objects to whom he might communicate of his fulneſſe; And therefore God of many thouſands hath made ſuch and ſuch his, not that he wanted their graces, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or praiers, but that they might partake of his riches.</p>

The devil who is called the <hi>God of this world</hi> is ſaid <hi>to rule in the hearts of the diſobedient</hi>; Hell is not more the devils place then the heart of a wicked man, and therefore 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.26. they are ſaid to be <hi>Captives to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,</hi> to be like tamed birds, and our Saviour tels the Phariſees, <hi>They were of their Father the devil,</hi> Joh. 8. And why? becauſe they <hi>did his works</hi>; So that whoſoever doth the works, committeth the ſins that the devils do, the devil is their Father; Though they rage and are mad at ſuch a charge, and this is the reaſon in part why the glorious fruit of Chriſts death is called a <hi>Redemption,</hi> and why he is called a Redeemer, becauſe we were wholly in bondage and captivity to the devil; We were his, he had a proper right to us till Chriſt redeemed us. Oh that the ungodly men of the world ſhould hear this and not tremble, Whoſe art thou? To whom doſt thou belong? Who may chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge thee but the devil? There are a curſed ſort of men who give themſelves to the devil by compact in the waies of witchcrafts; Now all wicked men though not by ſuch an expreſſe Covenant, yet implicitely by their wicked waies give themſelves up to be the devils: Oh what a terrible thing is this to conſider, that though thou canſt ſay, Theſe grounds are mine, theſe Cattell are mine, theſe goods are mine, yet thou thy ſelf art the devils; Oh conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that the devil will have his own when thou dieſt, he will loſe nothing; Neither ſoul or body ſhall eſcape him if thou continue his: Be thou awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of thy deſperate eſtate, If thou art not Gods Inheritance thou art the devils poſſeſſion, and thy tongue, thy eyes, thy body, thy whole life proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to whom thou doſt belong.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In being the Fathers, as we are no longer Satans, ſo neither <hi>the worlds</hi> or <hi>mens in the world</hi>: Hence we are commanded <hi>not to be Servants to men,</hi> 1 Cor. 7.13. or pleaſe men, and to call none <hi>Father on earth,</hi> Mat. 23.9. The ſenſe of ſuch commands is, that we are not to put our hopes and truſt in men, not to give up our ſelves to their commands when contrary to God, yet this is a ſinne that all are prone unto; It's the Favour of men, the power and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of men that ſwayeth us more then God: Alas thou wert not created or redeemed, or regenerated, to make man thus a God unto thee: Whence is it that our fear is a mans fear? yea, our Religion a mans Religion: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are not yet delivered from mans thraldom, ſo neither are we the worlds; For our Saviour ſaith, <hi>We are given out of the world to Chrict</hi>: Why then are we ſo immoderate in our cares and affections about theſe things? It's not the world that is ours; The Church was ſeen <hi>clothed with the Sunne, and the Moon under her feet,</hi> Rev. 12.1. God hath made the earth under us, and Gold and Silver to be in the bowels thereof, implying the low eſteem we ought to have of them, and that we look not on the world as a reſting place, but ſeek for heaven,</p>
            <p>Laſtly, <hi>We are none of our own in being the Fathers</hi>; Thus the Apoſtle, <hi>We are none of our own, Therefore we are to glorifie God both in ſoul and body,</hi> 1 Cor. 6.20. Our Tongues, our Body, our Affections, are not our own; We may not love as we liſt, nor deſire as we liſt: It's thſet and Sacriledge thus to ſteal from God; Why ſhould it be a wound in thy Conſcience to detain that which is another mans, and not rather that which is Gods: <hi>My Son give me thy heart</hi>; If ſinne hath it, If the world hath it, theſe are not the

This preſerving of us his, is more then making us his at firſt, for ſuch is our falſhood and inconſtancy, that we ſhould every day diſſolve all thoſe bonds of love between God and us: Did not he put this fear in our hearts?

            <p>In the next place we have the <hi>argument it ſelf,</hi> and that is from the homo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſiall conſideration of the Father and the Sonne, <hi>All mine are thine, and thine are mine,</hi> which words are not ſpoken <hi>quoad fruitionem</hi> only, or <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, but <hi>quoad eſſentiam,</hi> all that Wiſedom, power, Majeſty thou haſt, I have, we have all in common: Therefore this place is very ſtrong againſt the <hi>blasphemous Socinians,</hi> and uſed by the Ancients againſt the <hi>Arians</hi>; The <hi>Socinians</hi> have nothing to evade but only that our Saviour doth not ſpeak of the Fathers <hi>Eſſence</hi> but of his dominion and propriety; The Apoſtles were the Fathers by <hi>propriety,</hi> and ſo they were Chriſts alſo; But this will not ſtand, for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we muſt grant that before; The Apoſtles were ſaid to be the Fathers yet he proveth this by an Argument from the generall to the particular; No wonder they are thine and mine, <hi>for all mine are thine,</hi> Note the Univerſali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>all mine are thine, all thine are mine,</hi> If <hi>all</hi> then the <hi>Eſſence, Nature</hi> and <hi>Majeſty</hi> of God, otherwiſe it was not all, and if Chriſt were a meer Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture he could not ſay thus, for although the former part every creature may ſay, <hi>all mine are thine,</hi> in reſpect of dominion and efficiency, becauſe there
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:65216:151"/>
is no good, natural, moral, or divine but it's the Lords, and although in ſome ſence a godly man may by the Covenant of grace ſay to God, <hi>all thine are mine</hi> becauſe now made his God, in which ſence the Apoſtle ſaid, <hi>all things are yours,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. and I have all things, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. yet in regard of Gods eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall Attributes, his Omniſciency, Omnipotency, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> None but the Sonne and the holy Ghoſt who are God can truly ſay ſo; Now that our Saviour meaneth all in this ſence appeareth by a parallell place, <hi>Joh</hi> 16 15. <hi>all things that the Father hath are mine</hi>; Mark the aggravation, he doth not ſay <hi>ſome things</hi> but <hi>all things,</hi> then that the Father hath in the preſent tenſe; Now God hath nothing but <hi>eſſentially,</hi> he hath wiſedom, he hath life, but he hath it eſſentially not as creatures who have it <hi>accidentally</hi>; Therefore notable is that expreſſion <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.26. <hi>As the Father hath life in himſelf ſo hath he given the Son to have life in himſelf</hi>; No creature hath life in that ſence.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He ſaith, <hi>All things are mine,</hi> he doth not ſay ſhall be mine, when I am glorified, when aſcended into Heaven, but even in that very ſtate of humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, He ſaith, All that the <hi>Father</hi> hath, In calling him a <hi>Father</hi> he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth a perſonal diſtinction, which cuts off the Sophiſtry of the Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians; If Chriſt hath all things the Father hath, then he is the <hi>Father</hi>: No, the very compellation ſuppoſeth a <hi>relative diſtinction,</hi> though there be an <hi>eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi>:</p>
            <p>Thus you ſee the Text vindicated, and it's our duty diligently to vindicate thoſe Texts that aſſert Chriſts Deity ſo much oppugned, for if <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaid, <hi>Omnis ſermo adaptandus eſt contra Idololatriam,</hi> much more againſt this blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous hereſie.</p>

            <p>THis is a new Argument propounded by our Saviour in the behalf of his Diſciples; Formerly when he praied for himſelf he made this an Argument, that he <hi>had glorified the Father</hi>; Now when he praieth for his Diſciples, he urgeth, that <hi>they had glorified him</hi>: So that we ſee it's very acceptable to God the Father that Chriſt ſhould be glorified; He that is jealous of his glory and will not give it to another, that ſtrook <hi>Herod</hi> dead, and made him to be eaten with the vileſt creatures, becauſe the people cried, <hi>The voice of God and not of man,</hi> yet to his Son is willing that all honour and glory ſhould be given as he himſelf alſo had immediately glorified him from heaven.</p>
            <p>In the Argument we may conſider,
<list>
                  <item>1. The <hi>Perſon</hi> glorified.</item>

                  <item>3. The <hi>Subject</hi> in whom and by whom he is glorfiied.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Perſon</hi> is Chriſt; Having before aſſerted a <hi>community</hi> in <hi>eſſence</hi> and all things with the Father, he now aſſumeth alſo a propriety in the glory his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is to have; Chief and ultimate glory belongs only to God: Let not him that glorieth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. glory in his <hi>riches,</hi> in his <hi>honours,</hi> but that he knoweth God; The glory of God is the utmoſt end of man, and we may no more at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute it to a creature then divine worſhip; So that the Deity of Chriſt is here alſo implied.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The other is the <hi>action</hi> to <hi>glorifie</hi>; The word is in the preterperfect tenſe (as <hi>Auſtin</hi> thinks) for the future, according to the cuſtome of the Hebrews, for the Apoſtles had glorified Chriſt but little, comparatively to what they would do after Chriſts aſcenſion, when ſuch heavenly gifts were beſtowed upon them, but we may keep the proper ſignification, for the Apoſtles in that they left all, beleeving in him as the promiſed Meſſias, as alſo preaching and working Miracles in his Name did in a great meaſure glorifie Chriſt; Now when Chriſt is ſaid to be glorified by his Diſciples, that is to be underſtood declaratively only, not really for Chriſt being God, no reall glory could be added to him, only there might be an outward acknowledgement and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of it.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, There is the <hi>Subject, for them,</hi> Some of the Ancients referre <gap reason="foreign">

referre it to the Apoſtles of whom he had ſpoken before, <hi>They are thine,</hi> as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo becauſe they are the Subject for whom he is praying, and this is a new ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument in their behalf <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>ſo this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo is very well-pleaſing to God the Father</hi>; Chriſt uſeth it as an argument to the Father why he ſhould grant his praier for his Diſciples, becauſe they glorified him, ſo that two Propoſitions are in the doctrine.</p>

               </item>
            </list>
            <p>For the firſt, <hi>Let us conſider how many waies the people of God do glorifie Chriſt,</hi> and then why it's their duty:</p>
            <p>For the firſt, Chriſt is glorified in theſe particulars,</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>When by Faith they do receive and own him to be the promiſed Meſſias</hi>; This our Saviour you heard did again and again commend them for,<note place="margin">1. When by faith they own him to be the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed Meſſias.</note> they did beleeve him to be the Meſſias ſent of the Father, and ſo in other places they acknowledged this, ſo that the very acknowledging of him to be the Chriſt ſo often ſpoken of by the Prophets, and looking for no other, was in an high manner giving glory to him, as on the contrary; Thoſe Phariſees and unbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Jews who rejected him, ſaying, he was an Impoſtor and a deceiver; Theſe did in an high manner diſhonour him, making him a lyar, and therefore char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging him for communion with the devil, as if by him he did all his miracles; It is therefore a glorifying of Chriſt when he is acknowledged and beleeved to be the promiſed Meſſias, and that to him only belongs the characters of ſuch an one.</p>
            <p>But 2. This hiſtorical bare acknowledgement is not enough unleſſe there be <hi>a fiducial application of him,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. When there is relying on him as Mediatour.</note> 
               <hi>and an holy confident relying on him as the Mediator between God and man</hi>; To ſay as <hi>Thomas</hi> did, <hi>My God, My Lord,</hi> Joh. 20.28. and <hi>Paul</hi> Gal 2. <hi>who loved me and gave himſelf for me</hi>; This is that beleeving on him (a phraſe peculiar to the Scripture) that brings Salvation; It's one thing beleeve that there is a Chriſt who is a Mediator, and another in him as that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon by whom we expect to have Salvation; <hi>Auſtin</hi> formerly made a diſtinction between <hi>Credere Deo, Deum,</hi> and <hi>in Deum,</hi> but the Learned Criticks obſerve that the Scripture makes no ſuch difference in the phraſe, only we may for diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ſake uſe thoſe expreſſions for thoſe ſpoken of <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. to whom yet Chriſt would not communicate himſelf are ſaid, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,, Well, though the words and phraſes may be promiſcuous, yet the matter extremely differs, for many do <hi>ſpeculatively</hi> beleeve that Chriſt is the Mediatour, who yet pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctically do not out of the ſence and burthen of ſin lay hold on Chriſt; Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as this is indeed to glorifie Chriſt, when we renounce all our own righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, when we feel our ſinnes a greater weight then ever we can bear, when we cry out as they did in the Ship, <hi>Maſter, we periſh</hi>; The immediate danger they were in, made them cry out three times, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>we periſh, we periſh; we periſh</hi>; Thus that ſoul doth unfeignedly glorifie Chriſt that crieth out from the overwhelming nature of ſinne, I am damning, I am damning; This is to glorifie Chriſt when we ſee neither the Righteouſneſſe of the Law, or of Men, or Angels, can interpoſe between God and us, but Chriſts Righteouſneſſe onely; Therefore in Popery grace is obſcured, the Righteouſneſſe of Saints, and the merits of their own works eclipſe Chriſt; Hence they are like the Moon which though it receiveth all light from the Sunne, yet is the
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:65216:154"/>
only thing that obſcures and ecclipſeth it by its Interpoſition.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <note place="margin">3. To glorifie Chriſt there muſt be an outward pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of him.</note>3. To glorifie Chriſt is not thus only to acknowledge him, and to reſt on him, for theſe are only internal acts of the ſoul, and ſo a ſpiritual inward glory known by God only, but it's <hi>greatly ſeen in the outward confeſſion and profeſſion of him,</hi> and that to the greateſt reproach and danger which can be in the world, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. <hi>With the heart man beleeveth, but with the tongue profeſſion is made to Salvation</hi>; He that will be ſaved muſt in the greateſt danger and moſt ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful reproaches own Chriſt and his way; Thus our Saviour <hi>Luk</hi> 12.8. <hi>Whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſhall not confeſſe me before a crooked generation, of him my Father and I will be aſhamed</hi>; Certainly in this particular the Diſciples did highly honour Chriſt, for we know Chriſt himſelf was both by birth and life in a moſt contemptible manner; There was no <hi>comelineſſe</hi> or <hi>deſirableneſſe</hi> in him, and then at laſt was crucified in a moſt ignominious manner; Now for the Apoſtles to look on him as the Meſſias, to have ſuch high and indeared thoughts of him, when all the world held Chriſt wretched and accurſed, and would not upon any terms be of his followers, this was greatly to honour him; Therefore our Saviour ſaid, <hi>Bleſſed is he that is not offended at me,</hi> Mat. 11.6, It was the greateſt wonder in the world not to ſtumble at Chriſt; We ſee the wiſe men; the great men that lived then, they were all offended at his meanneſſe, <hi>Is not this the Carpenters Son?</hi> Mar. 4. Oh how hard would it have been for us to have received him as the Meſſias, if we had lived in thoſe daies, for thoſe that followed Chriſt they were but a handful comparatively, and they were of the more deſpicable ſort, and they were accounted illiterate and mad ſimple people that adhered to him.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <note place="margin">4. A receiving him as Lord and King.</note>4. They glorifie Chriſt <hi>who receive him as a Lord and King, to whoſe Laws they willingly ſubmit themſelves</hi>; For the ſelf-love of a man may make him glad of Chriſt as a Saviour, but then to reſigne up themſelves in an obediential man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to all the commands of Chriſt, in this they draw back: Chriſt is not to be conſidered only as a <hi>propitiation</hi> for our ſins, but alſo as a <hi>King</hi> who doth go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern his people by holy and ſpiritual laws, and hence we may reade that he interpreted the Law in a more ſpiritual and ſtrict way <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. then the Phariſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Doctors had done, and laid the axe to the very root of all corruption with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in us, he forbids heart-luſts, heart-paſſions, theſe Embers in the fire though they never flame out; he cals upon all to <hi>deny themſelves, to take up their croſſe, and to follow him</hi>; To love him more then <hi>Father</hi> or <hi>mother</hi>; If therefore we would honour Chriſt, it's our duty to forſake all thoſe rebellions we are guilty of, To lay down our oppoſition and enmity againſt his commands, to take <hi>his yoke upon us,</hi> and to think it <hi>light</hi> and <hi>eaſie</hi>; What an honour was it to Chriſt to have men leave all their outward ſubſiſtence and earthly comforts to follow him? Did they not hereby declare that they prized the ſervice of Chriſt more then all the world, and that they accounted more of his commands then the greateſt Monarchs in the world; So that all who walk diſorderly and contrary to Chriſts command, they ſay with thoſe in the Parable, <hi>Chriſt ſhall not reign over us</hi>; Though he will reign over them, maugre all their diſobedience, if he do not govern them with the Scepter of grace, he will break them with a rod of Iron.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <note place="margin">5. A ſuffering perſecution for his ſake.</note>5. <hi>Thoſe that ſuffer and endure all perſecutions willingly for his Name and Truth</hi>; They do in an high degree glorifie Chriſt; In a ſpecial manner did Chriſt take notice of his Diſciples, becauſe they had accompanied him in his Temptations, and the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> doth at large ſhew how God is glorified when men ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer not for ill doing, but as Chriſtians; That as they glorifie Chriſt, ſo Chriſt makes <hi>a ſpirit of glory to reſt upon them,</hi> 1 Pet. 4.14. Thoſe marks <hi>Paul</hi> did bear on his body, They were ſo many Trophees; Even as Souldiers count wounds a mark of honour, they have received in fight for their commander; When the
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:65216:154"/>
Diſciples went away <hi>rejoycing that they were accounted worthy to ſuffer any thing for Chriſts ſake</hi>; This did greatly redound to Chriſts glory; Oh then let not the people of God be afraid or ſhrink at reproaches, diſhonours, and troubles for Chriſts ſake, for wherein can they glorifie him more? Or can the world ſay upon better grounds, Behold how they loved Chriſt and his Truth, better then their eſtates or their lives; Thoſe millions of Martyrs that have died for Chriſts ſake, brought an aſtoniſhing even to the very heathens; No Emperour or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, No Maſter or Teacher ever had ſuch a multitude of Diſciples readily ſacrificing their lives, ſo that we miſtake if we think the glory of Chriſt hath been in ſuch an outward pomp as earthly Kings have been; No, by ſufferings, by revilings, by the moſt cruell deaths that malicious men could invent, they made the Name of Chriſt glorious through the whole world; Even as Chriſt called his own death a glorifying both of himſelf and his Father, ſo did the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries and calamities of his Children redound greatly to his honour, for grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter love and eſteem they could not ſhew then by laying down their lives for him.</p>

               <hi>Thoſe honour Chriſt and glorifie him who walk in an holy and worthy manner to that calling whereby Chriſt hath called them,</hi> 2 Theſ. 1.12. <hi>That the Name of Chriſt may be glorified in them?</hi> And how was that? <hi>by walking worthy of their calling</hi>; Even as on the other ſide when men live prophanely and wickedly they reproach Chriſt, and make the Gentiles to blaſpheme the Chriſtian way; Oh that this were ſadly thought upon by moſt; Is not every Town, every Family full of curſing, ſwearing, drunken and unclean perſons? Now theſe are a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to Chriſt, they make the Chriſtian Religion a ſcorn, and the name of it even to ſtink; Even as <hi>Salvian</hi> a zealous Writer againſt the prophane lives of Chriſtians, ſaid, The heathens by way of ſcorn might ſay, <hi>Chriſtiani ſanctè vix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſſent, ſi Chriſtus ſancta docuiſſet</hi>; They thought the reaſon why Chriſtians had no more ſober, chaſte, and godly lives, was becauſe Chriſt was not an holy Law-giver, he did not give them holy precepts; The looſeneſſe and prophaneſſe of a Servant is a diſgrace to his Maſter, and what diſhonour muſt this be that thoſe who call upon Chriſts Name, yet ſhould live according to the devils temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that they ſhould ſay they are for Chriſt, and their lives for Satan.</p>

Oh then let the people of God who are apt to be dejected and caſt down, to walk in a diſcouraged manner, to have their hearts pierced through with many thorny cares, Remember what Chriſt hath done for them, and how acceptable it is to him that we ſhould walk comfortably and thankfully; Is it not a diſhonour to the Maſter for the ſervant to be dejected and grieved? Doth it not proclaim to others that they account his ſervice an hard uncomfortable condition? Thus when men leave their former wicked courſes, and give up their names to Chriſt, but after that are troubled, grieved, and have no comfort or encouragement; Theſe reproach the Lord Chriſt as if the world could give better comforts then Chriſt, as if we had done for the worſe by forſaking the devils ſervice, and reſigning our ſelves up to the Lords; Oh then conſider that as in groſs prophaneſſe and unrighteous waies there is a ſcandal to Religion, ſo in all diſcouraged and uncomfortable dejections, refuſing to be comforted, thou art a diſhonour unto the Lord Chriſt, as if he could not give manna to us in the wilderneſſe of this world; Thus you ſee how many waies Chriſt may be glorified.<note place="margin">Why it is our duty to glorifie Chriſt.</note>

            <p>In this Verſe the Perſon of the Apoſtles and Chriſt are conjoyned together, Now the efficacy and force of the Argument lieth,

            <p>The preſent condition of Chriſt is deſcribed thus, <hi>I am no more in the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Of the Apoſtles, <hi>But theſe are in the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us explain the words that relate to Chriſts condition, and then ſee the pith of the Argument.</p>
            <p>For the firſt,</p>
            <p>Chriſt may be ſaid to be in the world two waies,</p>
            <p>Either 1. <hi>Inviſibly</hi> in reſpect of his divine nature and operations; Thus Chriſt cannot go out of the world no more then God, who is every where, and in this ſence he told his Diſciples, he would <hi>be with them to the end of the world,</hi> Mat. 26.</p>
            <p>Or 2. <hi>Viſibly</hi> and <hi>corporally</hi> in reſpect of his humane nature, and thus he was to be with them no more, ſo that this is a ſtrong place againſt, <hi>Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation</hi> and <hi>Conſubſtantiation,</hi> Though they would gladly evade the dint of it.</p>
            <p>But why doth Chriſt ſay <hi>I am no more in the world</hi> in the preſent tenſe, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing while and when he ſaid it, he was in the world?</p>
            <p>I anſwer. This Apoſtle (as is obſerved by the Learned) of all doth moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound with Hebraiſms, and with them it's ordinary to uſe a participle of the preſent tenſe for the future, as might be ſhewed; And beſides our Saviour was very ſhortly to go out of the world by his ſufferings; and it's ordinary with all to ſpeak of a thing as done which is immediately to be done, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> is ſaid <hi>by faith to offer up his Son Iſaac,</hi> when yet he did not offer him up, but was prepared for to do it immediately.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="272" facs="tcp:65216:156"/>Laſtly, Obſerve the difference between being <hi>in the world</hi> and <hi>of the world</hi>; When our Saviour ſaith, <hi>I am no more in the world,</hi> it ſuppoſeth he had been in it, but now he never was <hi>of the world,</hi> as he ſaith, <hi>v.</hi> 16. For to be <hi>of the world</hi> is to partake of the wickedneſſe and ungodlineſſe which reigneth there, <hi>The whole world lieth in wickedneſſe</hi>; And therefore Chriſt could not be <hi>of the world</hi> in this ſence; For the Apoſtles after their call, neither any converted perſons are thus of the world, though they be in it <hi>locally.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The words thus explained, Conſider the efficacy of Chriſts argument, <hi>I pray for theſe,</hi> and commend them to thy care and protection, becauſe I am going out of the world; I ſhall not be corporally preſent with them, I was a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to them, and preſerver of them, but now I commend them to thy hands; Thus we ſee the admirable care and love Chriſt ſhewed to his Diſciples, he ſeems to be more mindeful of them then his own ſelf; All his thoughts about his own ſufferings did not ſo affect him, but that ſtill he could remember his own Diſciples, that it may go well with them.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Doct.</hi> The greater the dangers are Chriſts people are in the greater is Chriſts care of them.</note>Obſ. <hi>That the greater the dangers are Chriſts people are kept in, the greater is Chriſts care and love to them</hi>; It was likely to be worſe with the Diſciples then ever, therefore it's ſaid, <hi>their hearts were troubled,</hi> Joh. 14. when he ſpake of leaving of them, for what can the Chickens do when the hen is killed; What can the Sheep do when the Shepherd is ſmitten; Now becauſe they were fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len into ſuch a condition our Saviour doth in amore ſpecial manner com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend their Eſtate to God, we do not reade that formerly he did in ſuch a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar manner give them up to God, becauſe their danger and temptations were not ſo great as were likely to be; This is a Truth worthy of all accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the godly; They are diſmaied when they ſee their afflictions riſe high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, never conſidering that the love and care that Chriſt hath to them doth alſo encreaſe, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13.1. when Chriſt ſaw the time of his departure was come, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving loved his own, he loved them to the end, more then ever he diſcovered his love, partly by condeſcending to waſh their feet, and partly by inſtituting the Sacrament as a remembrance of his death for them; So that as they ſay of all motions, they are ſwifteſt towards the end; Thus Chriſt loving his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples from his heart, upon pure grounds, he loved them moſt of all at his latter end, as the clock runs faſteſt at the laſt ſtroak; But it's good to open this Box of Oyntment that the ſweet ſmell thereof may comfort and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh us.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">I. If God remove ſome mercies he makes a ſupply of others.</note>And firſt, <hi>Chriſt never cals his people to any danger and temptations but as he removeth ſome mercies from them, ſo he makes a ſupply otherwiſe</hi>; If they are in greater ſtreights and difficulties then before, So if they do obſerve they ſhall finde ſome mercies they had not before; Chriſt will not let thee be a loſer by any thing he doth to thee; Neither will he be in thy debt, if he takes away any mercy, he will recompence it otherwiſe; So that ſtill his love is as great if not greater; See this notably <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.1, 2, 3. <hi>Let not your hearts be troubled,</hi> viz. at the ſad things I have told you of my departure, and the rage of the world, <hi>For I go away to prepare a manſion place for you; It's expedient I ſhould go away,</hi> you ſhall not be the worſe for it; Therefore <hi>v.</hi> 18. <hi>I will not leave you comfortleſſe</hi> or Orphans, I will ſend the Spirit of God to comfort you and abide with you; Thus you ſee, though Chriſt removed his corporal preſence from them, yet he gave them a ſpirituall preſence; If then the Spirit of God can be a Comforter to ſupply the room of Chriſts corporal preſence, how much more of a husband or father, If God take any of theſe away, pray that he would ſend his Spirit the Comforter, and if that can be better then Chriſts bodily preſence, much more then than ten thouſand Fathers or Husbands; Oh then let not the Children of God deject themſelves, either with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition they are in, or they fear may be in; If ſuch and ſuch things fall out,
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:65216:156"/>
what would become of me? Oh remember it's Chriſts way when he takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way one mercy to make it up otherwiſe again.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Chriſts love and care appeareth <hi>in that if he call to greater dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and afflictions, he will then give more ſtrength then ever to bear them,</hi>

               <hi>and more comfort then ever even to rejoyce in them</hi>: If then thy afflictions are more then ever what art thou the worſe? If thy ſtrength be greater then ever; God will not lay a Giants burthen upon a childes back; But if he prepare a Giants bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then for thee, he will enable thee with a Giants ſtrength; Thus theſe Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles becauſe they were to encounter with the rage and madneſſe of the whole world; Therefore did the Spirit of God come in an extraordinary manner upon them; They were commanded to ſtay at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> till they were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with <hi>power from above,</hi> Luk. 24.49. Thus before alſo, when our Saviour told them, They ſhould <hi>be hated before Kings and Governours for his Names ſake,</hi> he addeth, <hi>It ſhall be given them in that day to know what to ſpeak, in that day</hi>; Oh then when thy dejected heart ſaith, What ſhall I do if the Lord bring this and that ſad trouble upon me! If this or that temptation come upon me, it will grinde me to powder; Oh remember it ſhall be given thee <hi>in that day</hi>: If with <hi>Job</hi> he deprive thee of thy Eſtate, and Goods, and Children at once, it ſhall be given thee in <hi>that day</hi> to bear it; Do not then meaſure or compare a great affliction with that little ſtrength thou haſt at preſent; No, if God make the waters to encreaſe, he will provide an Ark for thee, the Apoſtles could not work miracles when they would, as they could not caſt out ſome kinde of devils, but when they were called to it, and their miraculous faith was increated then they could do it; Thus it is here, If God ſhould give thee no more faith, no more patience, no more heavenly-mindedneſſe then thou haſt at the preſent; Thou wert never able to bear ſuch mountains and loads of trouble that happily God may bring on thee, but God proportions thy ſtrengtht to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Were not live Coals beds of Roſes? Did they not rejoyce and ſing Pſalms? Now how came all this about? The more their miſeries were, the more were Gods mercies; Chriſt that gave them but drops before, doth now bid them drink the whole cup of praiſe and Thankſ-giving; Now they are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up to the Mount of Transfiguration, They have not only cluſters but the Vine it ſelf; Conſolations abound now, when never it may be before.</p>

            <p n="2">2. <hi>As he wiſely ordereth them to be, ſo his great care and love is ſeen in the time and ſeaſon when they are inflicted</hi>; Afflictions will not in every ſeaſon do good, no more then the cutting down of trees, or pruning of them is at any time to be done: The Patient may dye by the unſeaſonable letting of bloud; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt ſheweth his great care and love to take the opportune ſeaſon, to afflict and to exerciſe thee; As God would not have mercy upon <hi>Epaphrodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> preſently, but he lets him lie in danger, it being thereby better both for him, and <hi>Paul</hi> was thereby much afflicted; <hi>Paul</hi> had the <hi>buffetings of Satan</hi> which did greatly humble him, but when was the time; after his Revelations; And therefore that then it might not puff him above mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, It was that he had thoſe Thorns in his ſide; ſo that Chriſt doth not onely regard the neceſſity but the fit time and ſeaſon of all thy Troubles: Even as Chriſt himſelf came in the fulneſſe of time, ſo doe all his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſements, if they ſhould come ſooner or later, they would not do that good; <hi>Paul</hi> praieth thrice, yet could not remove thoſe ſtrong Temptations, 1 <hi>Co.</hi> 12.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>His love and care is ſeen in the nature and kinde of the affliction and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>: There are calamities of all ſorts; Now as it's not all kinde of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick that is for every diſeaſe, ſo neither all kinde of calamities that are fit for every ſinne; <hi>Hezekiah</hi> gloried proudly in the Treaſures he had, and therefore God cauſed an Enemy to come and ſpoil him of them, he might ſee by the afflictions what his ſinne was, <hi>David</hi> was too inordinately affected to <hi>Abſalom</hi> and <hi>Adonijah,</hi> and they became rebels to him and ſore af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions; Oh it's a great matter to obſerve the wiſedom and goodneſſe of God in ordering that kinde of affliction rather for thee then another, Thou waſt not thankful to God for thy health, or ſerviceable to him, therefore he afflicts thee with ſickneſſe: The people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were weary of Gods Service, therefore God delivered them up to evil Lords and Maſters, that they ſhould know what another ſervice meant; One Godly man lieth under one affliction and another under another: Now if one had that which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother hath he could never bear it, it would be more then death to him, ſo that the wiſedome and love of Chriſt is to be admired in all, ſay, this very kinde of affliction, and at this time comes from the love and care of Chriſt.</p>

               <hi>Chriſts care and love is ſeen in ſanctifying and fitting thy troubles that they ſhall be for thy ſpiritual benefit</hi>; Whatſoever may be done to thy eſtate or life, yet nothing ſhall hurt the ſoul: Thus the Prophet, <hi>This is the fruit of Iacobs trouble to purge away his ſinne,</hi> Iſaiah 27.9. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>All things work to the good of them whom God loveth</hi>: Chriſt that hath ſo loved thee would never let this or that come upon thee, did he not intend to turn it for thy ſpirituall good? This made <hi>David</hi> ſay, <hi>Before he was afflicted he went aſtray,</hi> Pſal. 119. And when both theſe go together, Afflictions and Sanctification, <hi>David</hi> cals it a Bleſſedneſſe, not a miſery, <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed is the man whom thou chaſteneſt, and teacheſt thy way,</hi> Pſal. 94 12. If God teacheth thee by thy afflictions the bitterneſſe of ſinne, the duty of Faith and weanedneſſe of Spirit from the world; Oh it's a bleſſed ſickneſſe, a bleſſed loſſe, Thank God that ever he laid his hand upon thee, Though it ſeemed grievous to fleſh, and thou wert apt to be impatient, yet nothing under Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven was better for thee; Not that we are to pray for afflictions; It's diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted whether we may or no, but we may not, <hi>becauſe they are an evil,</hi> and ſo no fit object of our deſires, and in themſelves they do no good unleſſe ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, but if the Lord chaſtiſe us we are to ſubmit, and therefore when <hi>Jeremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi> praieth, Jer 10 21. <hi>Correct me but not in thy wrath,</hi> It's a conceſſion or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion: Lord, if thou wilt correct me, and it cannot be otherwiſe, then do it with much mercy and love; Do not then make thy afflictions an argument of Gods withdrawing or leaving of thee, but rather of love to thee; Chriſt loves his Diſciples dearly, yet not ſo as to keep them from dangers, he will let them be in the world, and put them to hardſhip, only he will then take the more care of them: But the godly heart doth make this ordinary Objection.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It's true in thoſe troubles which are for Chriſts cauſe,</hi> as the Apoſtles were, It is no wonder if Chriſt take ſuch ſpecial care of his, if he account all the troubles and loſſes they have upon his ſcore, if he ſay to them as <hi>Abiathar</hi> the Prieſt, I was the occaſion of all the Prieſts bloud, therefore ſtay with me, thou ſhalt be as I am, and I as thou art, but my troubles and afflictions <hi>are the fruit of my ſin,</hi> It's not for Chriſts Name but want of love to Chriſt, it is my dulneſſe and lukewarmneſſe that hath brought anger upon me: To this conſider,</p>

So that though a godly man be never ſo powerful in grace, yet the world doth cool him, dull him, and indiſpoſe him: It cauſeth duſt in his eyes, and lead in his heart, To pray, to hear with worldly thoughts is to ſwim with a Millſtone about a mans neck; Hence <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. the cares of this world are ſaid to <hi>choak the Corn</hi> that came up ſo hopefully: As the Lark doth not ſing ſweetly till ſhe is got aloof from the earth towards the heavens, ſo neither can the ſoul full of earthly and worldly thoughts, May not then the godly cry out, O Lord I would fain me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate with delight on thee but this world will not let me: I would gladly ſerve thee without dulneſſe and diſtraction, but this world will not let me; Oh that while we are in our callings, in our worldly buſineſſes, we would think of what danger we were in: <hi>Korah</hi> and <hi>Dathan</hi> were ſwallowed up in the Earth bodily, take heed thy ſoul be not ſpiritually that is a more grievous judgement.</p>

To be godly in the world, To own the ſtrict and powerful waies of God in the world is to laugh amongſt Lyons, to dance among Serpents, to contemn all dangers; The Scripture tels us often that the world cannot but hate the Diſciples of Chriſt, for they are as Light and Darkneſſe together; Now then where there is continuall oppoſition for thee to be ſtedfaſt is a great matter: Oh how many have ſuffered ſhipwrack becauſe of the ſhame and reproach of the world; <hi>In mundo nihil noſtrâ refert niſi ut quam primum de oe exea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi>:

Now theſe diſcouragers in Heavens way are not only the profane and wicked ſort of men, but many times their deareſt Friends, their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, their Husbands, their Wives: What will you be wiſer then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers?

            <p>THe Condition of the Diſciples deſcribed by this, that they are ſaid to be <hi>in the world,</hi> makes them the fit Object of Chriſts Praier and Petition, ſuch are the Snares to ſinne and the outward troubles oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, that were it not for this Praier of Chriſt ſtill putting forth its efficacy; None could arrive ſafe to the Haven.</p>
            <p>We have handled the danger of being in this world, as it is <hi>tempting and ſeducing to ſinne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now let us conſider it as it is an hating and oppoſing world of thoſe that fear God, as it is an <hi>Egypt</hi>; Before we handled it as it was a <hi>Sodom</hi>; We conſidered the honey of it, now the ſting; The world fawning, now the world fighting; As it was a gliſtering Serpent, now as a roaring Lyon; So that the Subject we intend to purſue is, That the Godly are in this world as <hi>Daniel</hi> thrown amongſt Lyons, as <hi>Sheep</hi> among <hi>Wolves</hi>; As the Diſciples in the Ship, that were toſſed up and down ready to ſink every moment; This is ſo ſore a Temptation that our Saviour doth often forewarn them of it, that they may be forearmed, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.18, 19. There he foretels their Portion to be <hi>hated of the world</hi>: Hatred is the higheſt degree of a mans enmity, it's <hi>circa speciem,</hi> not <hi>individua</hi>; It's not enough to deſtroy one Diſciple, one Godly man,<note place="margin">The worlds great enmity againſt thoſe that are godly.</note> but they would raſe the whole kinde out of the Earth; Expect no mercy from any wicked man, he hateth thee; and did not God reſtrain him, he would utterly undoe thee; That every godly man is not devoured by the wicked is as great a Miracle as that the waters ſhould ſtand ſtill and not overflow the <hi>Iſraelites</hi>; It's not for want of malice and a will, only God who chained up the devil their Maſter, that he could not hurt <hi>Job</hi> any further then he was permitted, doth alſo confine his Children and Inſtruments; Our Saviour gives the reaſon why they will hate them, for it might ſeem ſtrange why the Godly ſhould be ſo oppoſed, they wrong none, they defraud none, they injure none; Oh but ſaith our Saviour, <hi>You are none of the worlds,</hi> you are not of them; Would you drink, ſwear, run into the ſame exceſſe as they do, then it
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:65216:162"/>
would love you and embrace you, Likewiſe <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.33. Our Saviour tels them again of this trouble from the world: And why <hi>again?</hi> Becauſe it's a very heavy burthen to bear; To live among Neighbours as among ſo many Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents and Scorpions, among <hi>unreaſonable men,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> cals them, and he prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to God to be delivered from them, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.2. Unreaſonable men, that are carried by no Religion, no Conſcience, no reaſon, but their luſts and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, Men that will hate you, becauſe they will hate you, <hi>abſurd</hi> men as it is in the Greek: You ſee <hi>Paul</hi> was afraid to fall into the hands of ſuch men, and <hi>David</hi> in many Pſalmes complaineth of this more then any thing; That there were men who had <hi>teeth</hi> like <hi>Lyons,</hi> and a <hi>tongue</hi> like a ſharp Razor, So true is that, <hi>Homo homini Lupus, &amp; homo homini Daemon</hi>; Becauſe therefore this is ſuch a ſtrong Tempeſt ready to ſhake the talleſt Cedar, Our Saviour again and again bids them expect it, for it's a great-quieting of the heart to be able to ſay, This is no more then I looked for, I thank God I am one that the world hateth, I ſhould ſuſpect my ſelf if wicked men loved me, our Saviour there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore tels them, they ſhall have <hi>trouble</hi>

            <p>
               <note place="margin">The ſeveral waies whereby a godly man fals into trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in this world.</note>To Conſider this more exactly Let us take notice of the ſeveral waies where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a Godly man fals into trouble in this world, and it ariſeth from many Springs.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Seeing that the moſt holy and godly that are have many imperfections and divers ſins, therefore God he brings many troubles on them</hi>; God in the firſt place he troubleth them,<note place="margin">1. Becauſe of their many ſinnes God brings many troubles on them.</note> though his troublings be like the troubling of the Pool, it's in mercy, and that healing might be vouchſafed; Thus God troubled <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> and made him encounter with grievous calamities becauſe of ſin; Thus <hi>whom God loveth he chaſteneth,</hi> Heb. 12.6. This is Gods judging of us <hi>that we might not be condemned with the world</hi>; And certainly it is this that ſo deeply wounds the Godly, that wicked mens tongues are but Gods Inſtruments of his diſpleaſure, as <hi>David</hi> when <hi>Shimei</hi> railed on him, <hi>The Lord hath bid him,</hi> ſaith he, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13.</p>
            <p>But beſides thoſe troubles which come mediately from God by Inſtruments there are immediate exerciſes which are more difficultly born then any out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward troubles; Thus God troubled <hi>Job,</hi> when he complained, <hi>The arrows of the Almighty ſtuck faſt in him,</hi> Job 6.4. Thus <hi>David</hi> often complaineth, <hi>God doth hide his face from him, and he was troubled</hi>; Theſe are temptations the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal man is ignorant of, he was never in theſe deeps where there is no trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble like this; If it were Plague, Famine Diſeaſes, the Soul could bear them, <hi>but a wounded Spirit who can bear,</hi> Prov. 28.14. So that herein the world is a place of trouble and miſery, that God many times exerciſeth his own people for their ſinnes, leaveth them in darkneſſe, yea, in an hell, that they are wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry abroad and weary at home; Whereas when once arrived in heaven, there ſhall be no more night but bright day alwaies.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <note place="margin">2. From Satan.</note>2. <hi>The trouble of Gods people in this world ariſeth from Satan</hi>; He is their profeſſed Enemy, and ſo creates them all the miſery he can, that becauſe he cannot torment them in hell he will do what he can in this world; Thus <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> compareth him to a <hi>Roaring Lion,</hi> 2 Pet. 5.8. How can a man but be troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to be in the danger of many Legions of theſe unclean Spirits, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. We are ſaid to <hi>wreſtle with theſe Principalities and Powers in darkneſſe</hi>; This our Saviour meant in part when he told <hi>Peter,</hi> Luk. 22.13. <hi>That Satan had deſired to ſift them</hi> as Wheat; In ſifting there is a commotion and a great agitation; Thus the devil intended not the ſeparating of the Chaff from the Wheat, but
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:65216:162"/>
to trouble and to confound them, that ſo they might the eaſier ſinne; Was not <hi>Paul</hi> exceedingly troubled when 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. he complaineth of the <hi>buffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge of Satan,</hi> againſt which he praied often, ſo that there is ſcarce any godly man but the devil doth immediatly cauſe trouble in his Soul by <hi>ſad temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, heavy ſuggeſtions,</hi> he comes and takes the good Seed away as ſoon as it is ſown, his Temptations are like ſo many <hi>Egyptian</hi> Frogs, alwaies croaking and troubling the Believer that he cannot <hi>pray,</hi> cannot <hi>beleeve</hi> in a promiſe, cannot walk in faith and peace as he ought to do, The devil makes it a troubleſome world.</p>

               <note place="margin">3. Their trouble ariſeth from the wicked and prophane in the world.</note> And this is the proper meaning of the Text, This is the world that hateth them, <hi>viz.</hi> the ungodly and wicked men, which are the greateſt part in the world; This therefore the godly muſt make account of, Think it no ſtrange thing to have wicked men malice thee, deride and trouble thee; <hi>David</hi> though a King yet <hi>Drunkards would make Songs of him,</hi> Pſa. 69.11. Chriſt though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any walked ſo holily and unblameably as he did, yet they ſlandered him and ſaid, <hi>He had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>n Devil</hi>; Mat. 12. The whole Nation cried, <hi>Crucifie him, Crucifie him,</hi> and they would have <hi>Barrabas</hi> a Murderer ſpared before him; Now our Saviour tels us, that the <hi>Servant muſt not expect to be above his Maſter,</hi> Joh. 13 16 If they abuſed, derided, and reproached Chriſt, thinking he was not worthy to live; Doſt thou think to eſcape? Did ever any Wolf or Lyon love the Sheep? Can the Serpent but have enmity to a man? Will not <hi>Cain</hi> kill <hi>Abel? Iſhmael</hi> perſecute <hi>Iſaac?</hi> No, <hi>darkneſſe cannot agree with light, nor Chriſt with Belial,</hi> The Sheeps bloud is ſweeteſt, and they finde a kinde of ſweetneſſe in their ſcofts and malicious plots againſt thee; Let the godly then not give place to any diſcouragement for a moment, Let the world rage, revile, oppoſe, <hi>thus muſt thou enter into Glory</hi>; Wicked mens tongues are like thoſe Dogges tongues that licked <hi>Lazarus</hi> whole; Their reproaches, their malicious words will help to make thee more Godly, and make thee walk ſo watchfully that thou mayeſt put them to ſhame which thus ſpeak evil and diſgracefully of thee.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>The Godly mans trouble in this world ariſeth not only from profeſſed wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men and open enemies,</hi>
               <note place="margin">4. And ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times from the godly them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</note> 
               <hi>but many times even from thoſe who really or apparently look towards the ſame Heaven with them</hi>: And this is the worſt trouble that can come from men, Some are only Friends in ſhew, and it's no wonder if they at laſt appear without their vizor; <hi>David</hi> makes ſad complaint of his <hi>familiar friend, with whom he took ſweet counſell,</hi> that this man ſhould riſe againſt him, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 41.9. and <hi>Paul</hi> alſo complaineth of the perill he was in by <hi>falſe Brethren,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.26. So that this is no new thing even for thoſe who profeſſe the ſame Chriſtian way, and that in a moſt intimate manner, yet to become Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies and Adverſaries to thoſe that truly fear God, was not Chriſt betrayed by <hi>Judas</hi> one of his own Company, that had left all, to become his Diſciple, yea, not only from apparent and ſeeming Friends, but even from thoſe who doe truly look towards Heaven, yet there is many times great trouble created by them: Was there not a <hi>Paroxyſme</hi> between <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas?</hi> Did not the <hi>Corinthians</hi> go to Law and wrong one another? Doth not the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> tell them of their <hi>envyings</hi> and their devourings of one another, <hi>Iam.</hi> 13.16. Why doth our Saviour above all things pray in this Chapter for the <hi>Diſciples <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity, That they might be one,</hi> but becauſe of the proneneſſe that is even in Gods Children, to fall out with one another, as <hi>Iacobs</hi> Children did; Hence we ſee Beleever againſt Beleever, Chriſtian againſt Chriſtian, purſuing one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other even to death; It was <hi>Cyprians</hi> Complaint of old, <hi>Madet orbis Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus mutuo ſanguine, &amp; quod cum privati fecerint homicidium dicitur, eum pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice geritur virtus vocatur:</hi> Oh what a ſad thing is it not to ſee Sheep and

Are not many godly mens Enemies of the <hi>ſame</hi> houſe, of the <hi>ſame</hi> Religion, of the ſame Chriſtian Faith with him? Oh this is hard to bear, if it were a prophane and wicked Inſtrument of the devil, I could bear it, but it is ſuch an one with whom I have praied often, humbled my ſelf often; They acknowledge the ſame principles of godlineſſe, the ſame experiences upon their ſouls, yet are like Lyons.</p>

It's as naturall as for the fire to aſcend, ſo that as it would be a miraculous and wonderfull thing to ſee the Fire deſcend downward, no leſſe would it be to ſee a man without ſome Trouble or other: We reade of one <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> that never had any Adverſity in his Life time, and he endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to put himſelf upon ſome Loſſe, but could not, for once he threw a Ring of a vaſt price into the Sea, intending to loſe it, yet afterwards it was found in a Fiſhes Belly, and he had it again; But though he had no trouble for a long ſeaſon, yet at laſt he was taken by an Enemy and put to Death with moſt exquiſite torments; Though wicked men have the good things of this life, yet theſe good things are not meerly and univerſally good; They have a Sting as well as Honey; They have Trouble as well as Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort: The Godlieſt men have acknowledged that their daies have been few and evil in this world: Oh then expect not a Summer alwaies in this world; God hath ſubjected all theſe created Comforts to changes after a Glorious day to have a dark Night; Thou ſhalt have this Condition, this Relation, this Comfort thou deſireſt, but thou ſhalt alſo have the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, and the trouble of it which thou doſt not deſire, <hi>Onus tranſit cum ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nore.</hi>

            <p>THis is the Third diſtinct Argument in this Verſe which Chriſt uſeth in his Petition for his Diſciples; Some indeed take it Exegeticall or Declarative of what he meant by ſaying He was no more in this world; But others take the Particle <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> ratiocinatively, as a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why he is no more to be in the world, becauſe he is going to the Father.</p>
            <p>This Argument implieth then that Chriſt by going out of the world doth not ceaſe to be, but that he goeth to the Father, and there will be a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Favourite in the Court of heaven for them; Chriſt then ſpeaking here of his Locall Motion, we may in this as in all ſuch Motions Conſider,</p>

That is he dieth, here there is contained much comfort to his Diſciples, that neither Chriſts Enemies or Death did overcome him, but by Death he goeth to his Father, and that for the great benefit and advantage of all true Believers.</p>
            <p>Obſ. <hi>That Chriſt by Death went to his Father</hi>;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Doct.</hi> Chriſt by Death went to the Father.</note> Here is much practicall Divinity in this Point; We ſee our Saviour again and again inſtructed his Diſciples about his; He knew how much his Sufferings and Death would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maze them and ſhake their Faith, he knew what a falſe principle they were poſſeſſed with, <hi>viz,</hi> that he would erect a temporall Glorious Kingdome; Therefore that they might not be undone by theſe thoughts, he tels them of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten both of his death, and whither by that he was to go, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14.3. Our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our comforts their troubled hearts with this, that he was going to the Father, and that not meerly for his own glory and honour, but alſo for their good; E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as <hi>Ioſeph</hi> was advanced in <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Court as well for the good of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and his brethren as for his own glory, and by the way obſerve that our Saviour tels them, <hi>That they knew whither he went and the way,</hi> yet <hi>Thomas</hi> in the name of the reſt ſaith, <hi>Lord, we know not whither thou goeſt</hi>: Now you may ask, Either Chriſt who is Truth it ſelf ſpake not right, or <hi>Thomas,</hi> The
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:65216:165"/>
anſwer is, Both ſpake right, for the Diſciples knew in the general and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly but not diſtinctly or particularly, or they knew it habitually, but in time of temptation they did not put this knowledge forth; By this we ſee the Godly may have that grace and that faith in them, which yet they think is not there.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, <hi>That it was appointed by God, that the way whereby Chriſt ſhould from this ſtate of humiliation come to glory with him, ſhould be the way of ignominy, reproach, and death; It behoved the Son of man to ſuffer, and ſo enter into glory,</hi> Luk. 24.46. It muſt be ſo elſe the Juſtice of God could not be ſatisfied, elſe mans Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption could not be obtained; This our Saviour implieth, <hi>I come to thee,</hi> but how, Even as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to <hi>Canaan,</hi> through a Sea of bloud; That then which our Saviour quickly ſpake, was with great pain and agony undergone; I come to thee through fire and bloud, The Father doth this to demonſtrate the bloudy nature of ſinne, the unſpeakable love of Chriſt, and the order God hath appointed for all beleevers ere they come to glory, 1. <hi>the bloudy nature of ſinne,</hi> for it was this and nothing elſe that put Chriſt to be a Sacrifice for us, had not <hi>Adam</hi> and we in him all apoſtatized from God; There had been no need of his death, but now by this tranſgreſſion, and ours ſuperadded, without the ſhedding of his bloud, there could be no remiſſion of ſinne; Yet oh the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneſſe and blindeneſſe of the world, what a little matter do they make of ſinne, how eaſily do they think a pardon may be had for it; Oh remember the leaſt vain thought or idle word cannot in this world or in the world to come be expiated but by Chriſts bloud only, had there been no other ſinne in the world but a vain thought, Chriſt muſt have undergone all that wrath of God and man ere it could be blotted out; Oh think of this you who like <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viathan</hi> laugh at the Spear, and ſport your ſelves with thoſe ſinnes, which put Chriſt to all that Agony: Laſtly, This ſheweth the order God hath appointed we muſt firſt be on Mount <hi>Calvary</hi> before we can be on the <hi>Mount of Transfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guration</hi>; As Chriſt had firſt a Crown of Thorns here, before he had a Crown of glory, ſo it muſt be with us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>We ſhall be glorified with him if we ſuffer with him,</hi> Let this then ſweeten all thy afflictions and miſeries, Though the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings of God with thee, like thoſe of <hi>Joſeph</hi> to his brethren, are harſh and rough, yet the endings will be full of ſweetneſſe and comfort; If thou grud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt at thy Tribulations ſay, this is to grudge at the Crown of Glory, This is to repine at the way to everlaſting happineſſe.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> In the ſecond general place Conſider, That when Chriſt ſaith, <hi>he goeth to his Father,</hi> herein is implied, <hi>that ſtate of glory and honour he ſhall have in heaven,</hi> as if he had ſaid, I ſhall be no more in the ſtate and habit of a Servant, no more in a deſpiſed and contemned condition, but I am going to receive that Majeſty and glory which is due unto me; Although we told you Chriſt aſcended into Heaven for our good, and to pleade our cauſe, yet it was alſo for his glory and honour; This our Saviour excellently preſſeth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.28 <hi>If ye loved me, ye would rejoyce becauſe I go to my Father</hi>; The Diſciples were troubled and full of fears becauſe they were to loſe his corporal preſence, but (ſaith our Saviour,) true love to me would make you do otherwiſe, you would regard my honour more then your benefit; It is for your good that I abide with you; It is for my glory that I go to the Father; Now love that is unfeigned lieth in our affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to another, not becauſe of the good we have by him, but for his own good; Thus the Diſciples they were to rejoyce becauſe Chriſt was to be honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and exalted, though they ſhould loſe the comfort of his preſence; See here then who are they that do ſpiritually love Chriſt, even ſuch as rejoyce in that he is exalted and glorified, though it be to their ruine and undoing; O Lord,
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:65216:165"/>
Let me have this comfort and that comfort no longer, if Chriſt may be more honoured; As <hi>Mephiboſheth</hi> ſaid, Let <hi>Ziba</hi> take all, ſo that King <hi>David</hi> was returned ſafe, ſo that the honour and kingdom of Chriſt may be promoted, let good Name, wealth, and life it ſelf go, <hi>unleſſe we be the true genuine Sons of God, we are never able to abide this touchſtone</hi>; Doe not the moſt holy depend on Chriſt more for the benefit they receive by him then to honor and glorifie him; Hence they bemoan their want of aſſurance and evidence which is their comfort more then recumbency on Chriſt, which is his glory; So then in that Chriſt went to his Father it's implied, that now there was a period to be put to all ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings: Now he was no more to be like a Servant but to be made the Prince of Glory, Therefore obſerve the reaſon why he goeth to the Father, <hi>becauſe the Father is greater then he</hi>; Not as the <hi>Arians</hi> would have it eſſentially, but in outward diſpenſation, becauſe Chriſt here was in the faſhion and form of the meaneſt and moſt deſpiſed of men.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> Thirdly, Though this phraſe imply Chriſts Exaltation, <hi>yet we muſt know alſo that in this is the whole Treaſury of a Chriſtian</hi>; The Fountain of all our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort is in this, that Chriſt is gone to the Father; Therefore let the beleever di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently improve it, for the effects are admirable of this his departure.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. <hi>Hereby his holy Spirit is given in, the more plentifully and abundantly</hi>;<note place="margin">The benefits of Chriſts aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eenſion and exaltation.</note> It is ſaid, <hi>The holy Ghoſt was not yet given, becauſe Chriſt was not yet glorified,</hi> Joh. 7.39. The large adminiſtration of the gifts of Gods Spirit were reſerved till Chriſt in triumph went up to heaven, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16.7. <hi>If I depart I will ſend him to you,</hi> You ſee the ſending of the holy Ghoſt depends upon Chriſts departure; The Spirit comes to make a ſpiritual ſupply of Chriſts bodily preſence; There cannot be two Suns together in the Firmament, O then let all thoſe who have Gods Spirit dwelling in them, enlightening, ſanctifying, and comforting of them, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge this, the bleſſed fruit of Chriſts going to his Father, but men are ſo prophane and ſenſual, that they know not what the Spirits working upon the Soul is, no more then a beaſt knoweth the operations of a rational Soul.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. A ſecond benefit by Chriſts going to the Father, is, <hi>the enabling of us with all holy and heavenly gifts,</hi> either in a ſanctifying way or a miniſterial; Thus; <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. Chriſt when he aſcended into heaven <hi>gave gifts to men,</hi> That you have a Miniſtry and Ordinances with the ſpiritual effects thereof, it's wholly from this Yea <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14 12. all miraculous Gifts do deſcend from this, Our Saviour there ſaith, <hi>That he who beleeveth on him ſhall do greater works then he doth,</hi> that is, as ſome ſay, greater Miracles in themſelves, for we reade that by <hi>Peters</hi> handker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief and his very ſhadow wonderful things were done, which we reade not of Chriſt, or greater in quantity and extenſion; They did them in more places, For whereas Chriſt wrought no Miracles at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> the Apoſtles did, or grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (as others ſay) in regard of the ſucceſſe, becauſe farre more were converted to the faith by the Apoſtles preaching then by Chriſts; Well, let this be how it will, Conſider the ground why they ſhall be enabled to do theſe great things, <hi>becauſe</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>I go to the Father</hi>; So that this departure to the Father is the cauſe of all thoſe <hi>dona ſanctificantia</hi> and <hi>miniſtrantia</hi> in the Church: Thy Faith, thy Repentance, thy Love of God and delight in holy things is becauſe of this truth.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The third Benefit of Chriſts going to the Father is from one main end of it, which is <hi>to prepare a place for his Children</hi>; Indeed heaven was prepared for them from Eternity, yet <hi>Chriſt</hi> Joh. 14.3. ſaith <hi>He goeth to prepare a place for them</hi> in an alluſive ſence; It's therefore for our infinite Conſolation that Chriſt is gone to the Father, for there he prepareth places of glory for us, and mark the word <hi>v.</hi> 2. <hi>In my Fathers houſe are many manſions,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that is ſpoken in oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to ours here, where we are but Pilgrims and ſtrangers; In the earth we have only Tabernacles, in heaven there are manſion places; They continue there to
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:65216:166"/>
all Eternity, and further he ſaith, many Manſion places; That they might not think there is not room enough, and withall it denotes the readineſſe of Chriſt to entertain us, as <hi>Rebeccah</hi> when ſhe invited the ſtrangers ſaid, We have ſtraw and Provender, and there is room enough; So that Chriſt is gone to heaven to ſee that Thrones of glory he provided for his people; Oh the Godly man dying, if in his temptations, is ready to think, O my Soul whether art thou go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? What will become of thee? where wilt thou lodge this night? To this Faith ſhould anſwer, Chriſt hath prepared a place, he hath provided a Reſt, and a dwelling-place, and though thy Soul cannot be alwaies in thy body, nor thy body alwaies in theſe houſes we dwell in, yet there is a manſion-place, from which we ſhall never be removed.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 4. <hi>Chriſt goeth to his Father, to be an Advocate and pleade our cauſe,</hi> 1 Joh. 2. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. <hi>He ever-liveth to make Interceſſion for us</hi>; Chriſt is not ſo affected with that glory and honour, God hath put upon him, that he ſhould forget the meaneſt of his children, he dealeth not as <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Butler that forgat poor <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph,</hi> when he was promoted, No, when we are not and cannot think or minde our ſelves, yet Chriſt is commending our eſtate to the Father, So that we have this glorious Friend ſpeaking for us in the Court of Heaven, whenſoever any accuſation is brought againſt us, So that the godly ſoul while it ſits ſighing, I am here ſinning and offending of God, may alſo remember at that very time there is a potent Advocate preventing all the dangers that may come by ſinne.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> 5. Chriſts departure from the Father is not an eternal departure; He is not ſo gone as to leave us for ever, but he will come again and take us to the Father alſo, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14.3. <hi>I will come again and receive you to my ſelf, that you may be where I am</hi>: This is the utmoſt happineſſe that a beleever can deſire, If it be ſuch joy for the childe to be with his Father, a wife with her Husband, how tranſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent is this mercy to be with Chriſt; Therefore in this Chapter our Saviour praieth for it, that his Diſciples be <hi>where he is</hi>; Now this being where Chriſt is, doth comprehend the communication of all glory and bleſſedneſſe, which Chriſt beſtoweth on his people, and that without any intermiſſion; Here in this life we have many clouds to intercept the Sun-beams with the Church through our unbelief and ſlothfulneſſe, we have loſt our beloved, ſo that many times the ſoul is ſtraitned and crieth out, <hi>where is he whom my Soul loveth</hi>; But then and there we have a perpetual communion with him, and if ſo be the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying of him by faith fill the ſoul with ſo much joy, what will the immediate fruition of him do? Thus you ſee that we are in a jejune ſpeculative manner, to ſay Chriſt by his death went to the Father, but to be affectionately poſſeſſed with it, as being the treaſury of all conſolation.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/> In the fourth general place, By this phraſe is ſignified to us <hi>that death could not detain Chriſt in the grave,</hi> it could not hold him there ſo as to hinder his going to the Father; By this therefore we ſee Chriſt hath triumphed over the devil and ſin with all the effects of it; The devil that prevailed by his Inſtrumens to put him to death, would much more have kept him alwaies in the grave, but his reſurrection and aſcenſion to heaven, there to be with the Father in glory ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth that he hath now overcome all his enemies, and which is the godly mans comfort, all his enemies likewiſe, for Chriſt and the beleever have the ſame ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, if Chriſt overcome they overcome; The devil is Chriſts Enemy, and death was Chriſts Enemy as well as thine, and it's good to obſerve that death is called Chriſts Enemy, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. <hi>Chriſt ſhall put all his Enemies under his feet, The laſt E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy that ſhall be deſtroied is death</hi>; See then that death which is ſo terrible to thee which thou lookeſt on as an Enemy, it is Chriſts, and he hath overcome it; Oh then what glad tidings ſhould this be in our ears, Chriſt hath aſcended to the Father, for that is as much as to ſay, Neither ſin, or devil, or grave could prevail over him, and therefore he hath fully diſcharged the work of a Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:65216:166"/>
he hath paid to the utmoſt farthing, ſo that the love and juſtice of God cannot but be ſatisfied by the atonement he hath made.</p>
            <p n="5">5. It's worth the obſerv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ng, that this expreſſion of Chriſts, <hi>I go to the Father</hi> doth put an excellent face upon that which is moſt terrible, for that which was death, and death in the moſt ignominious and cruel manner, he expreſſeth in this lovely and deſirable manner, <hi>I go to the Father</hi>; Thoſe agonies and drops of bloud, Thoſe deep and ſtrong cries, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> he covers over with this amiable phraſe, <hi>I go to the Father</hi>; Thus Chriſt out of the temptation called it ſo, but in the temptation he asketh why he had forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken him? Not that Chriſt in his temptation was guilty of any ſin, or was capable of any ſinful imperfection, only he had not the ſame experimental feeling as at other times, for when he had told his Diſciples all ſhould forſake him and leave him alone, yet ſaith he, <hi>I am not alone, for my Father is with me,</hi> Joh. 16.32. In his ſad temptation he had not the experimental comfortable ſenſe of this; No marvel then if the godly finde a great alteration of themſelves in a temptation, they have not the comfortable ſenſe and perſwaſion of that, which they felt when not tempted, for it was thus with Chriſt only without ſin.</p>

of their ſoul, <hi>viz.</hi> a preſervation from the evil of the world, and a perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance in good, ſo that here we have an admirable example for all Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, all that have charge over any Inferiours: As <hi>Abimelech</hi> ſaid to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>What ye ſee me do, that do ye</hi>; So what we behold Chriſt doing, let all Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters for others do the like, Let Magiſtrates, Miniſters, Parents and Maſters, ſee that it's the godlineſſe and Souls good of their Inferiours, that they are to purſue above all other things.</p>

We ſee from thence that this is ſo acceptable to God, that he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits ſuch into his choiceſt Secrets, and reveals himſelf more to ſuch then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, <hi>I know him,</hi> ſaith God, and that by this, he will not ſuffer his Children and Houſhold to do what they liſt, but he will command them to keep the way of the Lord; To ſet this upon our hearts, for all wickedneſſe and impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty doth commonly ariſe in Inferiours from the neglect of Superiors, and the waters cannot be ſweet as long as the Springs are bitter.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place, Know and ſet this down for a Rule, <hi>That whereſoever any Christian hath a Government, there is alſo a ſpirituall Charge and trust going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with it</hi>; In a Miniſter it is clear, In a Magiſtrate it is as clear, for he was to <hi>write the Law of God out,</hi> and that not for his own particular uſe, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.18. But thereby <hi>to govern his people,</hi> Inſomuch that it's a promiſe, <hi>Kings and Queens ſhall be Nurſing Fathers and Mothers to his Church,</hi> Iſa. 49.23.

And therefore <hi>Paul</hi> proteſted <hi>he was free from their bloud,</hi> becauſe he had <hi>made known all the Counſell of God</hi> Act. 20.26. Who then will be able to ſtand under this burthen? Haſt thou not ſinnes of thy own? but thou muſt have thy Childrens ſinnes, thy Servants ſins alſo to lie upon thy back as an heavy burthen: Will Chriſt at the day of Judgement condemn men, becauſe his poor Members were ſick and they viſited them not? They were hungry and they fed them not; And will he not much rather be provoked becauſe there have been ſick, ſinful, wicked perſons under thy care, drunkards and thou didſt not admoniſh, Swearers and thou didſt not frown on them; Shall God make Inquiſition for the bloud of the body upon Murderers? And will he not for the bloud of Souls? Shall <hi>Abel,</hi> though dead, ſpeak and cry Vengeance, and ſhall not Children, Servants, Inferiours damned in hell, cry out, ſaying, It was the negligence, the prophaneſſe of my Superiors that hath brought me hither: Were not men ſtones and Rocks, theſe Conſiderations would make them melt and tremble.</p>

Do they not prophane the Sabbath, and live diſſolutely? yet theſe things are no trouble to thy heart; Canſt thou ſay of thy Children as was ſaid of <hi>Auſtin</hi> to his Mother <hi>Monica, It was impoſſible that a Childe of ſo many Teares ſhould periſh</hi>; Are thine Children of praiers and tears, and careful inſtruction?

            </p>
            <p>For we are not to conſider of this Attribute meerly as a glorious property in God, but to improve it for our good, that we alſo might be made holy; This glorious Attribute <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6. the Angels of all others do ſingle out, and with great <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>cclamation praiſe God, ſaying, <hi>Holy, Holy, Holy</hi>; Yea, this is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Attribute we are to imitate, <hi>Be ye holy as I am holy,</hi> not be omnipotent as I am; Now God is holy ſeveral waies.</p>
            <p>And firſt, <hi>He is eſſentially holy,</hi> his holineſſe and his nature are not two things as it is in Angels and men; In this ſenſe Chriſt ſaid,<note place="margin">I. He is eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally holy.</note> 
               <hi>None is good but God,</hi> God is a pure act, and ſo whatſoever is in God is God; His holineſſe therefore is not only in that he worketh all things holily, but his very nature is holy: Hence God is called <hi>Jehovah,</hi> and <hi>I AM,</hi> Exod. 3.14. becauſe what he is he is eſſentially, and therefore ſeeing his nature is incomprehenſible ſo is his holineſſe; Seeing we are never able to define what he is, ſo neither can we what his holineſſe is, <hi>Quicquid de Deo dici poteſt eo ipſo indignum eſt, quia dici poteſt,</hi> Our dwarfiſh Nature cannot meaſure theſe <hi>Pyramides,</hi> Our ſhell can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not contain this Ocean; Though Aſtronomers by their Inſtruments gueſſe at the magnitude of the Sun, yet we cannot reach unto the greatneſſe either of Gods Nature or his Attributes.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>He is not onely eſſentially holy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">II. Oppoſitely holy to all falſe Gods.</note> but <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>and oppoſitely holy to thoſe falſe Gods mans corruption hath ſet up, and in oppoſition to the Devils who are called unclean ſpirits</hi>: Hence he is often ſtiled <hi>the Holy One of Iſrael,</hi> becauſe they only worſhiped the true God; Thoſe ancient Chriſtian Writers <hi>Arnobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, Auſtin,</hi> and others, who wrote in defence of the Chriſtian Religion, did convince Heathens of their Impiety, by worſhiping ſuch for gods whom yet they faſtened many impious actions upon, for certainly nature would have told them, That was God, <hi>quo nibil melius cogitari poteſt</hi>; Thus the God whom Chriſtians according to the Scripture doe ſerve is the onely holy and true God.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>He is holy in reſpect of his will, command, and approbation</hi>; His word is an holy Word, The Scriptures are holy Scriptures, They command,<note place="margin">III. Holy in his Will and com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mands.</note> They approve, They encourage and comfort nothing but holineſſe; <hi>David</hi> Pſal. 19. compareth them to <hi>Gold often refined</hi> that hath no droſſe, and <hi>Hab.</hi> 1. <hi>God is of purer eyes then to behold Iniquity,</hi> viz. by approbation; Therefore he is ſaid <hi>to be angry with the wicked all the day long</hi>; Oh then though other men love thee, and thou art in love with thy own ſelf, yet if not holy God doth not God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not love thee.</p>

               <note place="margin">IV.

            <p>
               <note place="margin">VI. Holy exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plarily.</note>Sixthly, <hi>God is holy exemplarily</hi>; He is the Rule, Pattern, and Example of holineſſe, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.15. <hi>Be ye holy as I am holy.</hi> Levit. 20.26. So that if we would know how we are to be holy, it muſt not be as men think, or as the world preſcribeth, but as <hi>God is holy</hi>: Not that we can attain to an equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, but to a ſimilitude onely; So that the principle of the world muſt fall to the ground; They will doe as others doe, or as moſt doe: Oh but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Conſider that God himſelf hath ſet down a Form for thee, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is ſuch fulneſſe in him as in an Ocean, therefore we have a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of growing every day; No man is as holy as the patern, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſtill he is <hi>to be perfecting Holineſſe and Righteouſneſſe in the Fear of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 7.1.</p>
            <p>Thus you have heard that God is holy, But in the next place know it is our Duty to improve this Attribute for our Good, For ſo our Saviour doth not look upon it as an abſolute property in God, but as that which may be profitable unto his Diſciples, So that we are to make uſe of this by Faith.</p>
            <p>And that firſt, <hi>Becauſe when God becomes our God by the Covenant of Grace, he is wholly ours, and all his Attributes are for our benefit and advantage</hi>; I will be their God: Now God is not our God nuleſſe his <hi>Wiſedome</hi> be ours, his <hi>Holineſſe</hi> be ours, that is for our benefit; For we cannnot ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate God and theſe; Oh then what an unwiſe and fooliſh thing is it in a Chriſtian when he hath ſuch a Treaſure, and yet will make no uſe of it, Such a Mine and yet improveth it not! In God there is holineſſe for all Angels and men, much more for thee.</p>
            <p>Secondly, God being thus abſolutely good, <hi>he is communicating of it,</hi> and it is a Rule, <hi>The more any thing is good, the more diffuſive it is of it ſelf</hi>; As we ſee in God, who though glorious and happy enough in himſelf, yet he created a world, and ordained many to Eternall Glory out of his meer good pleaſure and Fullneſſe, not that he needed or wanted any; Oh then it is very acceptable and well-pleaſing to God that we ſhould come with thirſting Souls unto this Fountain, and draw Water out of it, That we ſhould ſuck plentifully at theſe full Breaſts and be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed.</p>

            <p>Thirdly, Of Reproof to wicked men, who deride, ſcoff, and maliciouſly oppoſe holineſſe, What is this but to riſe up againſt God himſelf? Is not Holineſſe the Glorious Attribute of God? And do the Beams of this ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in his People offend thee? This argueth thou art of a perverſe and of a deviliſh Spirit, for thou ſhouldeſt rather reverence and honour it, ſaying, Oh that I might live and dye like ſuch holy men! Indeed there are many would like <hi>Balaam</hi> die like a Godly man, but not live like him, as One ſaid, He would live like <hi>Croeſus</hi> but die like <hi>Socrates</hi>; Yet this is impoſſible, There muſt be an holy Life elſe there will hardly be an holy Death.</p>

            <p>Obſ.<note place="margin">

               <hi>That even all the People of God were they not kept by Gods grace and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er they would every moment be undone both in Soul and body</hi>; It is not our grace, our Prayer, our Watchfulneſſe keeps us, but it is the power of God, his right arm ſupports us: We may ſee <hi>David</hi> praying to God that he would keep him in both theſe reſpects from temporal dangers, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 17.8, 9. <hi>Keep me as the Apple of thy Eye from the wicked that oppoſe me</hi>; Where he doth not only pray to be kept, but he doth inſinuate how carefully God keeps his people, and in what precious account their ſafety is, even as the apple of the Eye, and for ſpiritual preſervation he often begs it, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 19.13. <hi>Keep back thy Servant from preſumptuous ſinnes</hi>; Though <hi>David</hi> be Gods Servant, yet he will like a wilde Horſe run violently and that into preſumptuous ſinnes if God keep him not back, yea, he prayeth that God would keep the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar parts of his body that they ſinne not, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 141.3. <hi>Keep the door of my Lips,</hi> he entreateth God to keep his Lips, and to ſet a watch about his mouth, as if he were not able to ſet guard ſure enough; Thus much more are we to pray that God would keep our hearts, our mindes, our wils, our affections, for they are more maſterfull.</p>
            <p>Let us briefly conſider the firſt, God keepeth us from temporal dangers,<note place="margin">That God keeps all his from temporal dangers, prove</note> and that upon theſe grounds.</p>

None is ſo miſerable, but he may ſee others more miſerable then himſelf; It is the Lord that keeps all theſe cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes from thee, and thee from them.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. <hi>The godly man would be undone if God did not keep him from his own imbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility and infirmity</hi>; He hath no power to preſerve himſelf from miſery; Hence man is called <hi>Enoch,</hi> and in the New Teſtament <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, So that he doth not only deſerve all miſery but he is prone of himſelf to fall into it, did not God keep him, <hi>Job</hi> 14.1. and <hi>Job</hi> 5.1. <hi>Man that is born of a woman is full of trouble, even as the Sparks fly upwards</hi>; So that as the Spark if not ſtopt doth of it ſelf aſcend upward; Thus man of himſelf though there were no outward cauſe to drive him, yet would ſtumble and fall into all deſolation; Therefore the great troubles men lye under are ſelf-created, they come by our indiſcretion, blindeneſſe, or ſome ſinful way or other; Therefore <hi>Solomon</hi> obſerveth that a mans miſery is great on the Earth, becauſe he hath not judgement to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the times and ſeaſons of things, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 8.6. If therefore God did not keep the Godly man, no Childe would ſooner fall or run into the fire then he would into miſchief; You may reade of that good King <hi>Joſiah</hi> for whom the Kingdom made ſuch Lamentation, how fooliſhly he ran upon his own Death, 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 33.22.</p>

onely deſtroy the Soul but the body</hi>: You ſee his malice when he had liberty to poſſeſſe the bodies of many, how miſerably he tormented them, and when God gave him leave to afflict <hi>Job</hi> in his Eſtate and body, he did it to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt; There wanted no evil while he could do it; Now there is no reaſon why the Devil ſhould not do thee the ſame miſchief continually, but onely God bindes up this roaring Lyon; The Devil is ſaid to be <hi>a Murderer from the beginning,</hi> and that for the body as well as the Soul, he tempted <hi>Cain</hi> to murther <hi>Abel,</hi> he tempted <hi>Judas</hi> to betray Chriſt; Oh then wonder that God keeps thee when there are ſuch Legions of Devils crafty and potent enough to procure thy deſtruction.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 4. <hi>Did not God keep the godly he would be undone temporally, becauſe of the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred and malice wicked men bear to every godly man</hi>; Therefore Chriſt ſaid, <hi>they were as Sheep among Wolves</hi>; Can they hope for mercy from a Wolf? <hi>David</hi> complained that his <hi>Soul was among Lions,</hi> and <hi>Ezechiel</hi> complained he dwelt among Scorpions; Now then ſeeing the world is ſo full of malice, and the number of wicked men is like the Sand upon the Sea-ſhoar to them; They are as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> Army ſeemed to the great power that came againſt them, like a Flock of Birds; Now what is the reaſon that wicked men have not their will of deſtroying the Godly; It is onely God that keeps them, yea, God keeps every part of them, <hi>He keepeth their feet,</hi> Every ſtone elſe might be their Death; Yea, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 34 20. <hi>He keepeth all their bones, he maketh their Beds in their ſickneſſe</hi>; What an expreſſion is that? There is no Nurſe can ſo diligently and tenderly look to the ſick as God doth to a godly man diſeaſed: Oh then that we ſhould attribute our Eſtates to ſuch care and diligence of our lives, to ſuch places, to ſuch ſecond cauſes! and not rather look up to God who keepeth us all the day long; His keeping of all the godly doth not diminiſh his care in keeping every particular man, for it's God that keepeth every man, and that keepeth the Church in generall; How could this Ark that had no Sails, no Pilot, no Stern have been kept in the midſt of the Deluge? but that God preſerveth it, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 121.3. God is ſaid to be the <hi>Keeper of Iſrael,</hi> and ſuch an one that <hi>neither flumbreth or ſleepeth</hi>; Certainly could the people of God for their Eſtates, Lives, and all they have, commit all to this Keeper, they would live with more joy; Thou ſaiſt, who will keep me? Who will keep mine? Oh remember a better Keeper then if thou hadſt all the Monarchs in the world; Whence then ariſe your fears and doubts, but becauſe you are your own Keepers, or Friends muſt keep, or ſuch an Eſtate, and ſo much wealth muſt keep you; See what <hi>David</hi> tels us, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 121.1. <hi>Except the Lord keep the City even the Watchmen watcheth in vain</hi>; Though he watch and doe not ſleep, yet there muſt be a better Keeper: Say ſo of thy Houſe, of thy Family, of thy Children, and of all outward worldly things.</p>
            <p>Therefore let the Uſe of this Branch of the Doctrine be to all that are god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>to caſt off all fears and perplexities about any worldly thing</hi>; They have a faithfull Keeper, all their mercies are in his hand; The world, nor the devil cannot take them away; Is not the Childe ſecure becauſe he hath a Loving Father who keeps all things for him? We are not our own Keepers no more then our Creators: And if thou loſeſt any outward comfort, ſtay thy ſelf with this, I have a wiſe and an holy Keeper, who would not have ſuffered this or that loſſe to fall out, but that it was beſt for me to do ſo, and thou maiſt be encouraged to this holy Security, becauſe</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>God is an Omnipotent God, None</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>is ſtronger then my Father</hi>; Joh. 10. We betruſt men with things, and there comes a ſtronger then they who takes all away, but none can do ſo here.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>He is a faithfull and wiſe Keeper</hi>; He will not lye or deceive thee; Thou wilt have no cauſe to complain as <hi>Jacob</hi> did to <hi>Laban,</hi> That he had defrauded

him ſo many times; Thou canſt not truſt in riches, or in men, for theſe are unfaithfull, Theſe are a lye, but God is not like man, he will not deny himſelf.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>He doth not onely keep thee himſelf but appoints others alſo to keep thee</hi>; Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of Angels are appointed by him to keep thee, yea, all the creatures are a Safeguard to thee; The ſtones in the Field are at peace with him who fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth God: Did not thy Faith lie aſleep in thee, as Chriſt in the Ship, there would never be ſo many dangerous Tempeſts to overwhelm thee.</p>
            <p>But I proceed to the ſecond part, which is more principally intended by our Saviour, and of greater conſequence to the godly, for what i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p n="1">1.<note place="margin">1. God keeps the truth of grace in them.</note> 
               <hi>It's God onely that preſerveth and keeps the Truth of Grace once wrought in thee</hi>; We ſee <hi>Adam</hi> and Angels loſt their precious Treaſure of Grace; And can we think to be better Conſervators then they were? No, thou wouldeſt immediately of a Paradiſe become a noiſome dunghill, and a hell, did not the Lord keep thee; Hence the Apoſtle praieth ſo often, that God would <hi>ſtrengthen</hi> and ſettle them; No Leaf would fall ſooner to the ground then our Graces wither, did not God keep them; We ſee then upon what Rock the godly are built, what it is, that though they are in the midſt of ſpiritual Thieves and Robbers, yet their Jewels are not ſtolen, it is becauſe God keeps them; Hence is the perſeverance of the godly; Hence it is that <hi>Peters</hi> Faith is not totally and finally loſt: <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> were in ſad and great Temptations, in danger to loſe all the Truth of grace put into them, and all had been gone but that God kept them; So that as in natural things God is not only the Creator but Preſerver of all things, And if he did not uphold them by his arm, they would fall into their firſt nothing: Thus did not God graciouſly keep thee, thou wouldeſt fall into that old deſperate ſtate of impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety again, and be as prophane and wicked as ever before.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The Lord doth not onely keep the habits and being of grace,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. He keeps in the actual ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of the ſoul to good.</note> 
               <hi>but alſo all the quickenings and actuall ſtirrings of the Soul to good</hi>; Such Sparks would quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly go out, did not the Lord keep them alive; We might ſay of them as of mans life, They are but a Vapour and a Bubble; Thus 1 <hi>Chro.</hi> 29.18. When <hi>David</hi> and the people had with ſo much willingneſſe and delight offered unto God, he praieth that God would <hi>keep this for ever in their hearts</hi>; If then thou finde thy heart at any time raiſed up to actual hungrings and thirſtings after God, if it break for the longing it hath to God alwaies, then runne to God that he would keep this excellent frame of heart alwaies in thee; That the world and the Temptations thereof may not bring thee down again from this Mountain of Transfiguration; Say, O Lord, It's not in me to keep this frame of heart alwaies, I ſhall quickly loſe it; Something or other will take away this live Childe and put a dead one in the room of it; Oh therefore O Lord do thou help me and keep me, I renounce my own ſtrength, I ſee my own weakneſſe, and certainly if we are to pray to God for daily bread, though we have a B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <pb n="300" facs="tcp:65216:172"/>Now you muſt know, <hi>There is a great difference between the Degrees or quickenings of Grace and the Eſſence of Grace</hi>: Chriſt did not ſo pray that his Diſciples might not fall from any Degree of their Grace, Neither doth God ſo keep them as that they never ſtumble; No, we ſee the contrary to this, For the Diſciples fled through fear when Chriſt was apprehended, and though Chriſt in particular praied for <hi>Peter,</hi> That his Faith might not fail him, yet it did in ſome meaſure, otherwiſe he could not with curſing and ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo ſadly have denied the Lord Chriſt; Chriſts Prayer therefore, and Gods keeping doth infallibly extend to the Eſſence and Truth of Grace: They ſhall never loſe that, but for the Degrees and Intenſions they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſible, yea, ſo farre loſeable, that to the eye of others there is no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between a wicked man and them; As in the dead of Winter we cannot by the outward appearance tell which is a dead Tree, or a living, onely there is inward ſap in one which is not in another; And thus there is an inward principle of Life in one which is not in the wicked man; The Godly then notwithſtanding Gods keeping and Chriſts praying may loſe much of their grace, fall into ſad waies, and run much into debt, though they do not prove Bankrupts.</p>

If it be ſuch a difficult thing to get to Heaven, the way be ſo ſtreight, and ſo many prove Hypocrites and Apoſtates; What will become of me? How ſhall I doe? When the Godly are thus afflicted, let them remember God keeps them and with him all things are not onely poſſible but eaſie; He that could keep the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſhoes that they did not wear out, he can much more preſerve and deliver thee from being tyred out in thy way toward Heaven.</p>

            <p>THe Mercy prayed for, and the Subject for whom, deſcribed in theſe words, <hi>Thoſe whom thou haſt given me,</hi> have been treated of: Our Saviour doth ſo often repeat this Deſcription of his Diſciples [<hi>Whom thou haſt given me</hi>] that although we have ſaid much of it, yet what more may be added, ſhall be brought in <hi>verſ.</hi> 34. where in the laſt place it's men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</p>
            <p>I proceed therefore to the <hi>Inſtrumental Cauſe,</hi> or <hi>Manner</hi> how God is pray'd to keep them, and that is, <hi>Through his own Name,</hi>

            <p>Some take <hi>Name</hi> for <hi>Glory, Gods Name,</hi> for his <hi>glory,</hi> Ezek, 36.22. Pſa. 79.9. and then the Prepoſition <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>they</hi> take for <hi>propter,</hi> for it anſwereth the Hebrew ב <hi>Beth,</hi> which is ſometimes uſed ſo, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.28. <hi>Luke</hi> 22.20. And indeed here is a truth in this, becauſe whatſoever God doth about his Church, he doth it for his own glory: There is no merit or worth in us to move him; It's his own glory only, as <hi>Joſhua</hi> urged, <hi>What wilt thou do for thy great Name?</hi> Joſh. 7.9.

               <hi>beth auxilii,</hi> This ſeemeth very pertinent, and is part of the meaning, but laſt of all that which late Interpreters pitch moſt upon is, that <hi>Name</hi> is here taken for the <hi>Truth, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi> and <hi>Knowledge of God,</hi> both for the <hi>Object,</hi> the <hi>Doctrine</hi> that is known, and the <hi>Grace</hi> is, that Faith whereby we are enabled to know, it being uſuall in Scripture to call the Object of any affection, by the affection it ſelf. That <hi>Name</hi> is here taken for the Truth and Doctrine manifeſted by Chriſt, appeareth
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:65216:173"/>
from <hi>ver.</hi> 6. where it's ſo uſed, where the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is expounded by <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>
and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. Thoſe therefore that underſtand it of the true and pure Doctrine Chriſt hath delivered, retain the proper ſenſe of the Prepoſition <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Keep them in thy Name, in thy true Doctrine:</hi> So that they ſay, Chriſt prayeth, firſt for the purity of their Faith, 2. their Unity of Love and Charity, which are the two Pillars that bear up the Church of God.</p>
            <p>Others take <hi>Name,</hi> not for the Object, but for our Knowledge and Faith of this Doctrine, and ſo you have a notable uſe of the word, <hi>Revel.</hi> 2.13. and they make the Prepoſition inſtrumental, <hi>Keep them through the knowledge and faith of thee</hi>; as we have a like phraſe, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5. They are ſaid to be <hi>kept by the power of God through faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe three later Interpretations we take as one whole compleat ſenſe, for they are kept by the power of God in the true Doctrine, and a true faith in Chriſt is the means whereby we are kept. From the firſt Interpretation, that God keeps us by his power, Obſerve,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That it is not enough to be put into the ſtate of Grace,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Obſerv.</hi> That its not enough to be put into the ſtate of grace, unleſs by Gods power we are kept therein.</note> 
               <hi>unleſs by Gods Power we are kept therein:</hi> Or, <hi>When a man is regenerated, it's not his own ſtrength, or ability, but Gods power meerly that keeps him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us take notice of that place again, 1 <hi>Pet</hi> 1.5. <hi>Who are kept by the power of God through faith to ſalvation.</hi> The Greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is obſerved to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry emphatical, for it's properly uſed of thoſe who keep a place by a Gariſon of Souldiers, it's a military word; here it's applied to the Power of God that doth keep us as ſafely, as ſtrongly, and as ſecurely, as if we had an whole Army about us.</p>
            <p>So that the word denoteth two things,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>Defence</hi> and <hi>Cuſtody</hi> in a ſtrong manner the people of God have.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>great Danger</hi> we are in from Satan, ſinne and the world; for what needeth ſuch a defence, if there were no danger? It's then God that keeps us, and that to ſalvation: Though God did never ſo much for us at the firſt, yet ſhould he not keep to the very laſt to ſalvation it ſelf, we ſhould ſuffer ſhipwrack in the very Havens mouth.</p>
            <p>To open this Doctrine, Conſider,</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>That the power of God is neceſſary both to the beginnings of grace, and the progreſs.</hi> Chriſt muſt be not only the <hi>Author, but the finiſher of our faith.</hi> Heb. 12:2. When the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3. had ſhewed, that God through his abundant mercy had begotten us again, he ſheweth this is not enough, <hi>but we are kept afterwards by his power</hi>; only the power of God in working grace in us, at firſt findes us in a different eſtate, then when it preſerveth or keepeth us. At firſt the power of God findes us dead in ſinne, and in reſpect of any holineſs, like that Chaos at firſt without form and void. Therefore <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. it's a <hi>quickning power,</hi> which infuſeth ſupernatural life, and ſo maketh us of ſpiritually dead, to live: It's an Omnipotent, inſuperable Power, like that of Creation, which was out of nothing; and therefore we are ſaid to be <hi>created,</hi> and his <hi>new-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</hi> But in the progreſs of Grace, the power of God findes us not dead, but with ſpiritual life, only there cannot be any further motions or actings of this life without power from above, <hi>Acti agimus,</hi> and <hi>moti movemus,</hi> it's God that inableth us to believe, to hunger and thirſt after the enjoyment of him: Even as <hi>Conſervation</hi> doth not finde the creature in the Womb of nothing, as Creation did, only it continueth that being already exiſtent, which otherwiſe would fall into nothing: Thus did not the Lord bear up daily by his power, that heavenly building raiſed up by him at firſt in thy ſoul, it would become a very ruine, and not a ſtone left upon a ſtone. It's this later kinde of power, the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly need all the day long, if his right hand bear them not up, they immediately fall to the ground.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="308" facs="tcp:65216:174"/>Secondly, Although we ſay, It's the power of God onely that keeps the godly and not their own ſtrength, yet it cannot be denied, but that the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, as in ſome places it affirmeth, Gods keeping of us, <hi>So it alſo ſpeaketh of a godly mans keeping himſelf.</hi> Thus 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.22. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Keep thy ſelf pure,</hi> James 1.27. <hi>Pure Religion is to keep a mans ſelf unſpotted from the world,</hi> 1 John 5.18. <hi>He that is begotten of God, keepeth himſelf.</hi> Sometimes they are put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Jude</hi> v. 21. <hi>Keep your ſelf in the love of God,</hi> and not long after he addeth, <hi>To him that is able to keep you.</hi> So 2 Tim. 1.14. <hi>Timothy</hi> is exhorted, <hi>To keep the good thing committed to him by the holy Ghoſt.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi>
               </note> By theſe places we ſee a godly man is ſaid to keep himſelf, and Gods power likewiſe, <hi>Doth not this ſeem to attribute too much to man, or at leaſt divide the work of preſervation between God and our ſelves?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi>
               </note>I anſwer, No. For firſt, Our own keeping is wholly inſufficient and unable without Gods keeping, when man attends to the utmoſt, with all watching, and diligence, yet if God come not in with his power, all is in vain. We like <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hezi</hi> may lay the ſtaffe to the dead childe, but it will not riſe till the Prophet himſelf come. Satan and his power is greater then ours, if conſidered in our ſelves: Therefore no wonder, if we of our ſelves cannot combate with him; he that is with us is ſtronger then the devil, but not we our ſelves. And</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Though we keep our ſelves, yet this is wholly from and by God:</hi> We act with ſubordination and dependance on him, we keep our ſelves, becauſe God ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth us to do ſo, as the leſs wheel is moved by the greater, as the greater orb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveth the leſs; ſo that here is no glory or praiſe due to us no more than the pen that writeth, or the hatchet that cuts, for we depend wholly upon God, both <hi>quoad eſſe,</hi> the eſſence and being of grace would not continue did not he uphold it, as alſo, <hi>quoad poſſe,</hi> and <hi>quoad operari</hi>; Therefore our keeping is not <hi>à contra</hi>-diſtinct or ſeparate keeping from God, as if he were one partial cauſe, and we another, as when two lift one burden; but ours is from him, by him, and under him, as the Maſter guideth the hand of the Scholar to write.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">How far men may acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge Gods help, and yet not give the full glory to him.</note>Hence in the third place, <hi>We may acknowledge Gods power to help us,</hi> and that ſeveral wayes, <hi>and yet not not give the full glory that belongeth to him.</hi> All the Erratical Starres that have been in the Churches firmament, have at laſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged ſome power, ſome auxiliary help of grace, but yet juſtly condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Orthodox, as robbing grace of its due praiſe; for if a man ſhould ſay, It's Gods power that helpeth us, <hi>becauſe he created us at firſt with a ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſoul,</hi> ſo giving of us underſtanding and will, whereby we are inabled to chooſe what is good, here Gods power is acknowledged, but at a remote di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. Here like ſome Heathens, we ſacrifice the wax to God, but keep the honey to our ſelves; thus Nature and Grace is confounded; <hi>Pelagius</hi> at firſt thought this would ſerve. But if a man ſhould go further, acknowledging Gods power <hi>in revealing the object, though he worketh nothing upon the ſubject</hi>; Here God is acknowledged but at a low rate. Thus alſo <hi>Pelagius</hi> ſaid, It was the grace and power of God to make known and reveal the objects of faith, but when revealed, then we have power to believe them, as a man cannot ſee, till the Sunne ariſe, but of himſelf he hath perfect eyes to behold the light, Here is power given to God, but not enough, who doth not onely prepare the object, but fit and ſanctifie the ſubject.</p>
            <p>Further, If a man confeſs the power of God to help, <hi>Not abſolutely to do that which is good, but to do it more eaſily and willingly,</hi> as <hi>Pelagius</hi> at laſt did yeeld. Here is Gods power acknowledged, but ſtill here is not glory enough aſcribed to God. God will have all the glory, or elſe none.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, If we acknowledge the help of God <hi>to keep us neceſſarily, yet if we make it a general indeterminate cauſe, and not efficacious, till by mans will it be
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:65216:174"/>
particularized.</hi> Here is ſomething attributed to God, but yet ſtill much aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to man; Therefore though the Jeſuites have many large Tractates <hi>De au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xiliis gratiae,</hi> yet becauſe they do not make Grace efficacious in it ſelf antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently to our will, but our will to improve that; Therefore ſtill we ſay, They advance not Grace, for it's not Grace, unleſſe it be <hi>Gratuita omni mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do.</hi> Thus then you ſee a neceſſity of informing your judgements in this Point, That no ſubtill Hereticks under fair pretences, and acknowledgements of Grace, do deceive you: For <hi>Pelagius</hi> deceived the Eaſtern Biſhops by this means, yea <hi>Sulpitius</hi> was ſeduced by the Pelagians, who had been a long ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to them, which when he perceived, he was ſo grieved, that he enjoyned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf perpetual ſilence, as the <hi>Centuriators</hi> obſerve.</p>
            <p>In the next place, <hi>Let us conſider,</hi>
               <note place="margin">How many ways the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God doth keep us.</note> 
               <hi>How many waies the power of God doth thus keep us:</hi> and let it not be thought tedious, if I be long on this Text, I do not compell the Text to go one mile, one Sermon further than it would: The honey drops from the comb without any cruſhing of it. And</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>The power of God keepeth his people in the way of grace</hi> inſpirando, <hi>by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiring and breathing into the Soul ſuch holy thoughts, and quickning meditations, that thereby we are kept in the fear of ſinne, and love of God alwayes.</hi> The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith, <hi>We are not able to think of our ſelves any thing tending to our own good, or the good of others, but our ſufficiency is of God,</hi> 2 Cor. 3 7. How vain, idle and diſtractive would our thoughts be, if the Spirit of God did not ſuggeſt and put in other things? Therefore that is promiſed as a remembrancer, to bring to our mindes, ſuch things as we let ſlip, when the Church prayeth, <hi>Ariſe, O North, and blow, O South,</hi> (Cant. 4.6.) <hi>that her garden may give a ſmell</hi>; it's a prayer for the heavenly and holy breathings of Gods Spirit into the ſoul.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>The power of God helpeth</hi> excitando, <hi>by ſtirring up and quickning thoſe habits and principles of grace, which are in us.</hi> Our faith, our love, are apt to lie dormant in the ſoul, till they be awakened. Thus <hi>David,</hi> though in the ſtate of grace prayeth often, <hi>That God would quicken him, that he might keep Gods Commandments,</hi> Pſal. 119. And this the Church prayeth for, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. <hi>Draw me, and we will run after thee</hi>; ſo that were there not this drawing, this quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the people of God would be like ſo many lumps of earth, they would be very Idols in all their duties, ſeeing they would not ſee, and though knowing, yet not underſtand. This exciting grace is as neceſſary every moment to thee for ſpiritual life, as the air is for thy natural.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>The power of God keeps,</hi> inclinando, <hi>by inclining and determining the heart:</hi> For though the heart have grace in it habitually, yet the world and ſin tempt ſtrongly; ſo that theſe habitual principles work not, till God incline and determine the heart, as <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. beſides an heart of <hi>fleſh,</hi> God promiſeth to cauſe him <hi>to walk in his ſtatutes. David</hi> prayed, <hi>That God would incline his heart to keep his Law.</hi> This determining grace is that, which Pelagians, Arminians and Jeſuites object againſt, whereas if the power of God doth not this, our power will have the greater part in our Salvation.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>The power of God keeps us</hi> dirigendo, <hi>by directing and ordering our ſteps, ſo that we do not fall.</hi> We are very weak and unskilfull, and like babes, who are ſaid, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. <hi>to be unskilfull in the word of righteouſneſs</hi>; Chriſt and the way of faith is unknown to us, a ſtrange thing to us: As <hi>Sampſon</hi> being blinde, needed one to direct him, where the beams were: Thus we need direction con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Author of our ſtrength, and how we may be made partakers of it. When <hi>David</hi> was in <hi>Saul</hi>'s armour, he could not tell how to weild or manage it: The Lord Chriſt he it is that ſtrengthens his people; a kinde of omnipoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is communicated to them by him, <hi>I can do all things through Chriſt that ſtrengtheneth me,</hi> Phil. 4.13. But there is much skill, and an heavenly act requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:65216:175"/>
to make uſe of Chriſt, and to derive power from him: Therefore the Lord helpeth us by directing our hearts unto the love of Chriſt, and faith in him, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3.5. Hence <hi>David</hi> many times prayeth, <hi>God would direct and order his wayes.</hi> This directive power is of conſequence to us, for without it we ſhould throw our ſelves into every pit.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, <hi>The power of the Lord keeps us</hi> applicando, <hi>by an efficacious applying of the means of grace to us.</hi> For when we ſay, God's power keeps us in grace, that is not to be underſtood immediately, as Angels in Heaven are kept, but mediately by the Word and Ordinances. Therefore the organical and inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental cauſe of our conſervation is the word of God, as our Saviour afterwards prayeth, God would <hi>ſanctifie them by his truth, his Word was truth</hi>: So that this makes much for the advancement of Chriſts Miniſtery, and the Goſpel preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for by the lively working of theſe, we come to ſtand faſt. Theſe are the continual rubbings that keep heat in us: Theſe are the Cocks that crow, to put us in minde of our ſinnes: Theſe are the frequent alarms againſt our ſpirituall enemies, that they ſurprize us not in our ſecurity.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, <hi>The power of God keeps us</hi> corroborando, <hi>by ſtrengthening and forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the powers of the Soul while they do work.</hi> A man that is paralytical, though he hath life in him, yet cannot ſteadily and firmly move the parts of his body, but they ſhake as if they did not belong to the body: Thus even while the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God are acting, and working what is good, they do it ſo remiſly, ſo faintly, that did not the Lord confirm them, all their duties would be very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable to them. Hence <hi>Paul</hi> ſo often prayeth, <hi>That God would ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then and ſettle them, that he would eſtabliſh and build them on the work.</hi> It's a bleſſed thing to walk in the paths of godlineſs, with an imboldened and confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed heart.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, <hi>The power of God doth keep us</hi> ſuaviter alliciendo, <hi>by putting ſtrong conſolations, and ſweet delights in our ſoul, while we are doing his will.</hi> Nehem. 8.10. <hi>The joy of the Lord is your ſtrength. We glory in tribulations,</hi> when we are filled with joy. As fear and unbelief make feeble knees and weak hands; ſo joy and heavenly delight doth ſtrengthen and confirm the ſoul, What is that which makes Angels and Saints ſo inſeparably adhere to God, and that to all eternity, never weary of him? Is it not the infinite joy and delight they have in God? So while God doth thus give us to taſte and feel how good he is, while we have an experiment of the preciouſneſs of Chriſt upon our hearts, we ſtand immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable like ſo many Rocks in the ſame place, though never ſo many waves beat on us.</p>
            <p>Eighthly, <hi>Gods power keeps us from ſinne</hi> reprimendo, <hi>by repreſſing and curbing thoſe reliques of ſinne, which are within us</hi>; For from our own ſelves would ariſe ſuch noiſome luſts that would ſeparate us from God; even as from the earth ariſe ſuch black vapours, that hide the Sunne from it. The Spirit of God therefore doth mortifie the body of ſinne, keeps this root from ſprouting forth, and is ready to cruſh the Cockatrice in her eggs.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, <hi>The power of God doth keep us</hi> arcendo, <hi>by driving away, and keeping of the devil from us.</hi> How ſtrangely this roaring Lion is ſet upon us as a prey, appeareth by that of our Saviour, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. <hi>Satan hath deſired to winnow you,</hi> he would ſpare no godly man; Therefore he is called the Tempter, becauſe all the day long it's his work to ſeduce to ſinne; ſo that herein the neceſſity of Gods power appeareth <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. <hi>We wraſtle with principalities and powers.</hi> Thou art no fit match for them: You ſee that <hi>Adam</hi> in the ſtate of integrity was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by him. It's God then that keeps theſe roaring Lions tied up, otherwiſe what could poor Sheep do to oppoſe ſo many Lions?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of Inſtruction.</hi> With what thankfulneſs and joy we ſhould bleſs God at the cloſe of every day? Haſt thou not been a <hi>Cain,</hi> a <hi>Judas</hi> this day? Bleſs God

We may be ſtrongly convinced of the great neceſſity of Gods power in keeping of us <hi>by the Apoſtate Angels and lapſed Adam</hi>; What can more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly teach us this Truth then their Apoſtacy? Did not God create Angels full of Light and Glory like the Starres? and yet the Apoſtle <hi>Jude</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">From the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtate Angels and lapſed <hi>Adam.</hi>
               </note>
               <hi>They kept not their firſt habitation</hi>; Did not alſo God create <hi>Adam</hi> after his own Image in Righteouſneſſe, yet how quickly did he become a Prodigall, and ſpent all? You ſee here the moſt glorious of all Creatures, furniſhed with a rich ſtock, yet in a very little ſpace proved Bankrupts, and loſt all; Oh then what ſhall the godly man think of himſelf who hath not ſuch ſtrength of grace as they had; And beſides they had no corruption or principle of Rebellion within them to betray them as we have: Who then is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled by this conſideration to acknowledge the glorious right hand of God to uphold his Servants from falling every moment, for in that all the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels did not fall as well as ſome, it is to be attributed to the meer confirming grace of God, therefore they are called the <hi>Elect Angels,</hi> 1 Tim. 5.21. God did by his power graciouſly confirm them in what was good, and denied ſuch help to thoſe that revolted; Oh then let the Godly Soul pray fervent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:65216:176"/>
Lord keep me daily; <hi>Adam,</hi> yea, the glorious Angels could not keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and ſhall I think my ſelf ſecure?</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> Secondly, Therefore need we the power of God to preſerve us though furniſhed with inherent grace, becauſe <hi>grace abiding in us is but a Creature that needeth help and ſupport as well as other Creatures</hi>; Though Grace in us be the moſt glorious thing in the world, and the Image of God, yet being ſtill a created being, it needeth preſervation from God; So that as in our naturall life we live, and breathe, and move in God, So it is much more in our Spirituall Life, So that as our grace becauſe of the imperfection of it cannot juſtifie us or ſave us, ſo neither from the weakneſſe of it can it preſerve, Grace is not God, neither hath it the power of God.</p>

               </note>Obj <hi>And if you ſay, That actuall help of grace whereby God keepeth us, that is but a Creature, and then that muſt need another help, and ſo in infinitum,</hi> as ſome <hi>Arminians</hi> urge.</p>

               </note>I anſwer, Grace inherent in us is by way of a permanent principle abiding in us, and ſo needeth ſome to excite and quicken it, but this actuall helping is by way of a tranſient principle, moving but not continuing, and ſo that doth not need a further help; This is like the ſharpening of the edge of the tools; This is like the actuall Ejaculation of the Sun-beams, which make Objects to be actually ſeen; Take heed then of magnifying grace too much within us, as in Popery, when it is made our Righteouſneſſe whereby we are juſtified before God, or when we judge this able of it ſelf without further Auxiliaries of God to preſerve us.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> Thirdly, Grace is neceſſary to keep us, <hi>Becauſe while we are in this Life we are yet but in the way</hi>; We are not come to our Eternal home in Heaven where we ſhall be ſo confirmed that we ſhall not need ſuch peculiar helps as now we do; We are here ſtill in the way; Our Condition is compared to a <hi>warfare,</hi> to a <hi>Wrestling</hi> and <hi>fighting</hi>: We are but in the race, we have not yet put on the Crown, and therefore Gods aſſiſting grace is alwaies neceſſary; One rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon the Orthodox give why we are juſtified by imputed Righteouſneſſe and not inherent, why our inherent Righteouſneſſe is imperfect, though God could make it perfect, is becauſe God thereby would make us humble and low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in our ſelves; But ſay the Adverſaries, if we were perfectly holy there would be no danger of pride no more then there is in thoſe that are glorified; To which it is anſwered, That ſuppoſe a man were made perfect in this Life, and were yet in <hi>viâ,</hi> not <hi>in termino</hi>; There would be as much danger of pride as there was in <hi>Adam</hi> and the Angels; The Saints therefore glorified they are made perfect, they are no more in the way; They have overcome, and ſo are made Pillars in the Temple of God, that never ſhall be removed; But it is not thus with the moſt holy man, he is yet fighting, ſighing, groaning, and ſo needs daily cuſtody.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/> Fourthly, <hi>If we doe Conſider thoſe many Commands and Exhortations, not to be high-minded, but fear,</hi> Rom. 11.20. To walk with fear and trembling, Theſe argue a neceſſity of dependance upon God; The Apoſtle <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. bids a man <hi>take heed of boaſting leſt he fall,</hi> for thou beareſt not the Root but the Root thee, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.18 This is very pertinent, Thou doſt not keep God to thee, but God keepeth thee to himſelf; The branch gives not juyce to the Vine, but the Vine to the branch; The Arminians from ſuch Exhortations would inferre the Apoſtaſie of Saints, but they are rather practicall and powerfull means whereby he doth preſerve his people; By theſe admonitions to take heed of falling they are enabled to ſtand; Only by them we are advertiſed to look up unto God as being unable to eſtabliſh our ſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/> Fifthly, <hi>The remainder of corruption within the Godly,</hi> that is very active, and working proveth the neceſſity of Gods gracious power; <hi>Paul</hi> Rom. 7.
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:65216:176"/>
complaineth of the lively power of this <hi>Law of ſinne within him,</hi> and that at all times, and in all duties, even ſo farre prevailing that it hindred him from doing <hi>the good he would</hi>; Now then if we have ſuch a powerfull Enemy with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in us, if from our own hearts would ariſe luſts to deſtroy us, who ſeeth not the neceſſity of Gods keeping of us? Alas, we live all the day in ſpiritual dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, our Souls may be betraied every moment, Did not God therefore keep us we needed no Enemy to deſtroy us but our ſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VI"/> Sixthly, <hi>The malice and power of Satan continually aſſaulting of us</hi> proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the great neceſſity of Gods power; He is the Tempter, and he is a roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Lyon to deſtroy; The Devils are the <hi>principalities in high places,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all he is moſt ſet againſt the godly, as <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. Now who could be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure in the midſt of ſo many Legions of devils, if Gods arm did not alwaies ſupport us? would not Satan have poſſeſſed the heart of <hi>Peter,</hi> as much as he did <hi>Judas,</hi> had not Gods power withſtood him, his Temptations are ſo ſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſo ſubtlely managed, ſo importunately urged, that it muſt be a power from above that can overcome them; They are called <hi>Satans darts,</hi> and his <hi>fiery darts,</hi> to ſhew how quickly and forcibly they can enter, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.16.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, That Gods gracious help is neceſſary every moment appeareth <hi>in the ſad Fals and woful decaies of the truly Godly,</hi> which could never have been, had they not with <hi>Sampſon</hi> deprived themſelves of their ſtrength; how comes <hi>David</hi> in all that mire of Uncleanneſſe and Murder, how comes he to be made indeed like one of the vile perſons of the Earth, as once <hi>Michol</hi> falſly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braided, but that God had withdrawn his preſent aſſiſtance, and whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſins or Fals you reade of in the Godly, it was becauſe the Lord was not a preſent help to them in that Temptation, as when the Sun withdraweth his Light it muſt needs be dark, or his heat it muſt be cold.</p>

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> Secondly, <hi>Take heed of wilfull throwing thy ſelf into the occaſion of ſinne</hi>; For by this means thou tempteſt God whereby he forſakes thee; Thou wilt runne into the flames, and yet expect Gods power to keep thee, this is to tempt God, <hi>Peter</hi> will be in the High-Prieſts hall, and where wicked company is, and no wonder if it prove a Temptation to him, he that handleth pitch ſhall be defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with it: He that cometh near an infected perſon may blame himſelf if the plague ſeaze on him.</p>
            <p>

<pb n="314" facs="tcp:65216:177"/>
and acknowledgement of this his gracious power, Unthankfulneſſe makes God withdraw his mercy; how often hath God aſſiſted thee both by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving in what is good, and from what is evil, yet thou haſt not called upon thy Soul and all within thee to <hi>bleſſe his holy Name?</hi> Therefore thou ſhalt to thy woe finde what a ſad thing it is to be left to thy own ſelf, and not to have his grace to help in time of need.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Interpretation takes <hi>Name</hi> for the <hi>Knowledge of God and Faith in him,</hi> So that the ſence is, Keep thoſe thou haſt given me, by Faith, as 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5. This is part of the meaning, and from thence we obſerve,</p>

               <note place="margin">Why faith confirmeth us rather then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther graces.</note>Faith is <hi>that grace to which the promiſe of Gods power is made preheminently; To him that beleeveth all things are poſſible,</hi> Mar. 9.23. So that as all the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are <hi>yea and amen in Chriſt</hi> as the Foundation and meritorious cauſe, ſo they are <hi>yea and amen</hi> to Faith as inſtrumentall; It's of Faith that the promiſe may be ſure, <hi>Rom,</hi> 4.16. What promiſes then or deeds of gift God hath made over to his people; They are all made effectuall to the beleever; No Faith, no help, no aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. <hi>Faith only receiveth into the Soul Chriſt who is the authour and procurer of all strength; Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>He can do all things through Chriſt that ſtrengthens him,</hi> Phil. 4.13. But how ſhall we make Chriſt ours? How ſhall he come to dwell in us? The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>By Faith,</hi> Eph. 3.12. So that herein Faith is greatly inſtrumentall to keep us becauſe it brings Chriſt with all his power into our ſoul, It deriveth all ability from him; It's not Faith but Chriſt by Faith received that doth thus enable; It was not <hi>Sampſons</hi> hair the weakeſt part about him, but Gods power, whereof that was a Symbole or ſign that did confirm him; No wonder then if Faith be thus ſerviceable to preſerve us; Seeing that by it Chriſt is wholly made ours, in whom all Fulneſſe both of grace and power dwels.</p>

all other graces, it emptieth a man of himſelf, it makes a man renounce what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever priviledge and righteouſneſſe he may ſeem to have; Thus <hi>Phil.</hi> 3 <hi>Paul</hi> refuſeth all priviledges, accounts all gain <hi>loſſe</hi> in reſpect of Chriſts Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe which is by Faith: As the Criple caſt his eye upon the Apoſtles, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping to be healed, he had no thoughts of his own Sufficiency but their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er only, So it is here; Faith makes a man caſt his eye upon God, and look up to him only for ability; Oh then prize and nouriſh this grace of faith which doth ſo nullifie thee and omnifie God.</p>

So that as the Word preached is uſed by God to beget Faith in us at firſt, ſo afterwards Faith doth improve the means of grace for all encreaſe; If therefore we would expect to have the Miniſtry and the holy means of grace to keep us in the way to heaven, it muſt be faith that makes all theſe profitable.</p>

Becauſe of the frequent and diligent exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations given to all, that they fall not from the truth.</note> and where there is great danger, leſt <hi>they alſo be lead aſide</hi>; Therefore errour is not the way to Heaven, and the <hi>Errour of the wicked</hi> it is called; Wickedneſs is ſhewed in corrupt Doctrines, as well as in prophane lives, (ſo as <hi>to fall from their ſtedfaſtneſs</hi>) if you begin to ſhake, to doubt, it's a ſinne, we muſt not fall from our ſtedfaſtneſs: There is a notable place alſo <hi>Jude verſ.</hi> 3. when the Apoſtle gave himſelf diligently to write of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, what doth he pitch upon, to ſtrive for the true <hi>Faith,</hi> and he doth not barely write, but exhorts, his affections as well as his judgement, are ſet on work, and it's not ſimply to believe or keep the faith, but <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Secondly, <hi>True Doctrine is a ſpecial mercy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Becauſe one main end of the Scripture, is to inform and keep us therein.</note> 
               <hi>becauſe one main end of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is to inform and keep us therein.</hi> As God made the Sunne a fountain of all light, and the Starres ſhine with a borrowed light from it; ſo hath God put all ſpiritual light into the Scriptures, and with this Sunne both Paſtour and people are to be cloathed. The Scripture is not only a rule of our life, but of our faith principally, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. The Apoſtle there reckoning up the admirable uſe, and end of the Scriptures, puts this in the firſt place, <hi>That it is profitable for Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi>; How then dare a man ſay, it's no matter what Religion I am of, all the doctrinal Diſputes are but Scholaſtical Subtilties? Is not this to blaſpheme the perfection of the Scripture? and is it not horrible ingratitude to God, who giveth his Church the Scriptures, as the moſt glorious Jewel it can enjoy? This was the Jews priviledge, <hi>to them were committed the Oracles of God,</hi> Rom. 9.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>It's a ſpecial mercy to be kept in the truth, becauſe the Lord hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Officers in the Church, for this end among others,</hi>
               <note place="margin">3. Becauſe the Lord hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers in the Church for this end among others, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the truth.</note> 
               <hi>to preſerve and propagate the truth.</hi> If it be then of ſuch eſteem with God, ought it not to be alſo with us? And wherein doth Gods regard to his truth more appear, than in ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Officers in his Church, whoſe main work and imployment ſhould be to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeminate this pure ſeed whereſoever they come, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.14? There we have Offices given to the Church, and one end is, that believers <hi>be not toſſed up and down with every winde of doctrine:</hi> And though <hi>Timothy,</hi> as ſome expound that place had propheſies concerning him, what a glorious inſtrument he would be in the Church of God, yet <hi>Paul</hi> doth again and again exhort him <hi>to keep the ſame doctrine he had delivered to him,</hi> (1 Tim. 9.20.) <hi>O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thee</hi>; That compellation is inſinuating, and argueth much affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in <hi>Paul,</hi> and there is a reaſon even in the very expreſſion of faith, he cals it <hi>depoſitum,</hi> as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> obſerveth; it's a greater ſinne to imbezil, or alter that, than any thing we have borrowed, becauſe this is committed to our Juſtice; but a <hi>depoſitum</hi> to our faithfulneſs. The Depoſitor doth reſt upon us as truſty men; So that by this all the Miniſters of God are to be awakened, Chriſtian faith and doctrine is committed to you, as the preſervers of it; <hi>The Prieſts lips are to preſerve knowledge, and the people are to require it at their hands.</hi> The Apoſtle 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.14. as if <hi>verbum ſapienti ſat eſt,</hi> were not true in this matter, doth again re-minde him, <hi>to keep the good thing committed to him</hi>; See with what eſteem he ſpeaks of the true Doctrine, and this is to be done by the <hi>holy Ghoſt.</hi> The matter is ſo great, that unleſs the Spirit of God inable us, beſides all our ſtudy and learning we are not able to keep it; yea a Deacon muſt not be ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, unleſs he <hi>hold faſt the myſtery of faith in a pure conſcience,</hi> 1 Tim. 3.9. Oh then, let none have low thoughts about that, which God hath appointed an Office for, and therefore given them the titles of the <hi>light</hi> and <hi>ſalt,</hi> and <hi>nihil eſt ſole ſale utilius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>It's of ſpecial conſequence to be preſerved in the pure faith,</hi>
               <note place="margin">4. Becauſe the more godly &amp; endeared any are to God, this priviledge they ſhall have to be kept in the truth, at leaſt ſo as not damnably to erre.</note> 
               <hi>becauſe the more godly and endeared any are to God, this priviledge they ſhall have to be kept in the truth, at leaſt ſo as not damnably to erre.</hi> Inſomuch that a ſound judgement in Religion, will diſtinguiſh a godly man, as well as an unblameable life. <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. Our Saviour ſpeaking of falſe prophets, with what powerfull pretences they ſhould prevail, ſaith, <hi>If it were poſſible, they ſhould deceive the very elect</hi>; If it were poſſible: You ſee by this, that there are ſuch <hi>falſe waies in Religion, that are inconſiſtent with ſalvation</hi>; and therefore the <hi>elect</hi> man ſhall not fall into them, no more than into groſſe and abominable ſins, <hi>viz.</hi> ſo as totally to loſe Heaven and ſalvation. Yea <hi>John</hi> 10. our Saviour deſcribes his ſheep and goats,
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:65216:179"/>
not by their lives, but by their attending to the true Doctrine, <hi>My ſheep hear my voice, and a ſtranger they will not hear, yea they will flee from him,</hi> verſ. 5. So that a godly man doth hang his godlineſs about his intellectuals, as well as mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals; He is not onely to conſider, Am I diligent in prayer? Do I walk conſcio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably in my wayes? But am I alſo a <hi>lover and prizer of the true Doctrine of Chriſt?</hi>

They had ſome good conſcience once (though not truly ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) but this they repell, they do not love it any more, it's againſt their inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts, their worldly advantages, their luſts and carnal affections; Can we then have too precious thoughts of Gods truths, ſeeing they onely are bleſſed to a mans true godlineſs?</p>

               <note place="margin">6.

Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der not, if you ſee ſome ſeducer come to a Town, and in a moment corrupt mens mindes, and make them his Diſciples, and ſo overthrow that building which a faithfull Miniſter hath been many years building up, you ſee it was of old ſo, <hi>Paul,</hi> though an Apoſtle, <hi>neither by man, nor of man,</hi> yet found it ſo; and at another time he complaineth, how ready they were to become even ſlaves to falſe-teachers; they might abuſe and domineer over them, you ſuffer if a man buffet you, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> onely the true Apoſtles they could not bear them. We ſee then, why it is that a goodly field may ſuddenly be overrunne with tares, a hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Church, the body of Chriſt, be all over with a Gangrene, and made de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.

            <p>In the ſecond place the Apoſtles may be conſidered ſtrictly and particularly, as men in office, as thoſe who were appointed to preach the Goſpel, and ſo our Saviour praieth for their <hi>

            <p>It is of infinite conſequence that the Miniſters of the Goſpel ſhould agree a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves, for when they are divided the people muſt be divided; If the Pilates in a Ship diſagree the Ship muſt neceſſarily ſink; So that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour knowing the devices of Satan to ſet Apoſtle againſt Apoſtle, Paſtor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Paſtor, he therefore praieth for their Unity in this Miniſterial Office and emploiment, and the expreſſion is obſervable, he ſaith not, that they may be <hi>united,</hi> but be <hi>one,</hi> and that according to the higheſt example of all unity, the <hi>Father and the Sonne: Luther</hi> thinketh the Subſtantive anſwering <gap reason="foreign">

                  <item>Such an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity the Father and Chriſt have, as the Diſciples are prai'd for to have:</item>
                  <item>But that is a <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity and Concord and Agreement, not of Eſſence:</item>

            </p>
            <p>This ſeemeth to be very ſpecious and plauſible. But</p>
            <p>Firſt, Grant that we ſhould interpret the <hi>Oneneſſe</hi> ſpoken of in the Text of <hi>conſent</hi> in <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Agreement,</hi> as <hi>Calvin</hi> doth, yet it doth not follow, that other places ſpeaking of their Oneneſſe ſhould be alſo underſtood in the ſame manner, yea from the <hi>Oneneſſe of Will</hi> between the Father and Sonne, is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily inferred the Oneneſſe of their nature: So that although we ſhould underſtand this principally of Unity in accord, yet by conſequence it would prove Unity of Nature; for in free Agents, where there is the ſame will, there there is alſo the ſame nature; where there is the ſame humane will, there is the ſame humane nature; and where is the ſame divine will, there is the ſame divine nature, indeed with men it's the ſame <hi>ſpecifical nature,</hi> not <hi>numerical</hi>; but becauſe there is one God onely, therefore it muſt be the ſame <hi>numerical nature.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="325" facs="tcp:65216:182"/>But in the ſecond place, We are to take the Unity of the Father and the Sonne, in as large a ſenſe (at leaſt not to exclude it) as in other places it is. Now in other places, eſpecially <hi>John</hi> 10.30. there we have undeniable Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to prove it is an Eſſential Unity, <hi>I and my Father are One. Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</hi> though otherwiſe a Papiſt, yet in this point againſt the <hi>Arians,</hi> is Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox, and doth ſtrongly maintain the truth againſt them. Now theſe three Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments he brings, That the Unity ſpoken of in that verſe, is <hi>Eſſential.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, Becauſe otherwiſe our Saviours Argument there mentioned would be inſufficient; for thus Chriſt argueth, <hi>None can pluck my ſheep out of my hands, becauſe none can pluck them out of my Fathers hands:</hi> Why doth this follow? <hi>Becauſe I and my Father are one.</hi> So then, if Chriſt and the Father had not one power, and ſo one Divine Nature, the Argument would not hold.</p>
            <p>A ſecond Reaſon is, <hi>Becauſe the Jews did underſtand him in this ſenſe,</hi> and therefore they took up ſtones to ſtone him; and mark the reaſon, <hi>verſ.</hi> 33. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou being a man, makeſt thy ſelf God.</hi> If our Saviour had meant no more, then <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of Agreement with Gods will.</hi> The Jews knew that <hi>every godly man had the love of God in this ſenſe written in his heart.</hi> Therefore they could not think that blaſphemy. They did not think that <hi>David</hi> made himſelf a God, <hi>when he delighted in the Law of God,</hi> making his will to accord with Gods.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Becauſe our Saviour upon this accuſation, <hi>doth not deny the thing, or charge them with falſhood,</hi> but further proveth it, <hi>Becauſe he doth the works of the Father,</hi> therefore he bids them believe his works, if they will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him, which are to make them know that the <hi>Father is in him, and he in the Father</hi>; upon which words it's ſaid again, <hi>verſ.</hi> 39. <hi>They ſought again to take him,</hi> implying, he had not corrected, but confirmed that more, which they called blaſphemy.</p>
            <p>In the third place, Though our Saviour prayeth the Diſciples may be One, as he and the Father are; yet their Argument will not hold, unleſſe they can ſhew, that <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> is uſed for ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude, not equality, <hi>Luke</hi> 6.36. <hi>Be ye mercifull, as your heavenly Father is mercifull:</hi> There it's a note of ſimilitude onely, for how can a drop be equal to the Ocean? So 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.2. <hi>He that hath this hope purifieth himſelf as God is pure</hi>; Here it muſt be a note of ſimilitude, for none can be equal to God in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; and thus here in the Text, endeavour to be One, as the Father and the Sonne, not that you can equalize it, but propound that abſolute and perfect Rule to follow: Inſomuch that if this place be well conſidered, it makes againſt all <hi>Arians,</hi> and ſo is <hi>pro teſtimonio fidei,</hi> which they perverted <hi>in argumentum perfidiae</hi>; and <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s obſervation is not to be neglected; Chriſt ſaith, he pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>that they may be One as we are</hi>; he doth not ſay, <hi>that they may be One with us,</hi> or <hi>that they and we may be One, as we are One, but that they may be One, as we are One.</hi> What more may be ſaid upon this, is to be ſpoken unto <hi>verſ.</hi> 21.<note place="margin">

            <p>Let us but conſider in how many reſpects we are to aim at ſuch a Unity as is between them.<note place="margin">1. The Unity between the Father &amp; Son is a ſpiritual union.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>The <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity between the Father and the Sonne is a ſpiritual <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity:</hi> Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that ſome have called the Spirit of God, the holy bond of the Trinity; It's not a carnal, bodily Unity, but ſpiritual; and thus ought the Miniſters of
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:65216:183"/>
the Goſpel to be, though they be of the ſame nature, of the ſame fleſh and bloud, yet if they have not the ſame ſpirit compoſing and ſanctifying of them, they will be like ropes of ſand; This the Apoſtle urgeth admirably, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 4, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and <hi>verſ.</hi> 13. where enumerating the ſeveral gifts and operations of Gods Spirit, he ſtill addeth, <hi>It's the ſame Spirit,</hi> and by <hi>one Spirit,</hi> we are all baptized in the <hi>ſame</hi> bond. This then ought to be our Unity, the holy Spirit of God is to move, work and guide all our hearts and affections. As it's the ſame Soul that informeth all the parts of the body, or as ſome Philoſophers ſaid, There was one <hi>intellectus agens,</hi> that was univerſal to all men. There may be agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for civil and political conſiderations, but this will never hold, till there be a ſpiritual Unity. As <hi>Tully</hi> obſerved, That all friendſhip founded upon <hi>bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num utile,</hi> or <hi>jucundum,</hi> would never endure, unleſſe they added <hi>bonum hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtum</hi>; We may adde further, Even that moral honeſt good, is not ground enough, unleſſe it be <hi>bonum ſpirituale</hi>; If then the Spirit of God did work, the ſame meaſure of illumination and ſanctification in all, there would not be any diſagreement; but though all godly men have the ſame Spirit, yet not the ſame gifts or graces, or degree of graces, and for want of this cometh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention.</p>

Its conſtant and individed.</note>Secondly, <hi>The <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity between Father and Son is conſtant and individed.</hi> There can never be a ſeparation between them. The Father and Sonne were alwayes one, though the manifeſtation of this is more, under the Goſpel-light, then it was under the Law; and thus ought the Miniſters of the Goſpel to agree con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly, perpetually; for if at any time contention breaketh forth, it proveth like a dead flie in a box of ointment, it makes all the other good they have to be ill ſpoken of; Let them never be ſo learned, ſo godly, ſo zealous, yet diſcord will ſcandalize all; and this conſtancy of Unity is to be preſerved againſt all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward or inward cauſes of difference; outward is the perſecution and oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of enemies to the Church of God; inward is from our own corruptions and diſtempers.

            <p>
               <note place="margin">4.

How happy would it be to lay all differences and diſputes aſide, that they might bring people to the ſaving knowledge of God? What a ſpur ſhould this be to us? Shall the Father not think his Sonne too dear? Shall the Sonne not think his bloud too dear for mens ſouls, and ſhall we ruine ſouls by conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? Do we not take the devils work then upon us, and not Chriſts?</p>

This unity ends in all ſchiſm and diſorder at laſt.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, <hi>The <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Father and the Sonne is moſt perfect and abſolute.</hi>
               <note place="margin">6. Moſt perfect and abſolute.</note> It's an eſſential Unity, and although we cannot have this Unity, yet this ſhould teach us to a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>m at the higheſt degree of unity we can, not to ſuffer the leaſt grud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging and repining thoughts, not the leaſt proud or envious thought againſt one another, to love more then father or children, then husband or wife, or any kinde of relation that cauſeth unity, <hi>for they are but one fleſh</hi> This calleth for an higher unity. We have heard the duty and neceſſity of unity, as alſo the cauſes that break it, what good remedies may be preſcribed to keep this excellent har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony. Although I ſhall not lanch into this whole point, deferring it, till <hi>verſ.</hi> 21. yet I ſhall name ſome,</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>We are earneſtly to pray to God, to beſtow ſuch a ſpirit of concord.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Means to be uſed to get and keep this unity</note> It's not the induſtry or policy of all the Conciliators, Moderators and Pacificators in the world, to bring this about, but God onely can bend mens hearts for it. Hence we ſee our Saviour praying to the Father for this agreement, and God is called, <hi>The God of peace,</hi> becauſe he only can make it in the Church and State. It's from Gods anger and wrath, when an evil contentious ſpirit is amongſt the Prophets, as well as when he ſends a lying ſpirit amongſt them, when the Temple was to be deſtroyed, the rending of it was a prognoſtique of the deſolation thereof; and when God will unchurch a Church, and make a Garden a Wilderneſs, common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diviſions are the antecedent cauſes of it.</p>
            <p>A ſecond Rule is, <hi>To rejoyce in the parts and gifts of others, as much as our own, when God is glorified by them, and to be compaſſionately affected in the weakneſſes and failings of others.</hi> Theſe two are neceſſarily joyned together, and they are able to cement, and unite all differences. The former is to rejoyce in other mens gifts, and abilities with that ſucceſs accompanying them, as if they were our own. As we ſee <hi>John</hi> did, <hi>John</hi>'s Diſciples came with an envious ſpirit againſt Chriſt, and ſaid, <hi>All men runne after him.</hi> This was enough to leaven and ſour <hi>John</hi>'s heart, but ſee his excellent temper, <hi>I muſt decreaſe, and he muſt increaſe,</hi> John 3.30. he was willing that Chriſts light and glory ſhould be exalted, though it darkned and obſcured his. This is a good Reconciler, and the latter is a tender forbearing of one another, and ſuffering of one anothers weakneſſes, and a proneneſs to forgive others raſhneſs, if the ſtones of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> were thus poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed and ſmoothed, they would lie even and firm together.</p>
            <p>A third Rule is, <hi>Love to the publique good of the Church, if this did reign in our hearts, it would compoſe all differences.</hi> The true mothers bowels would not ſuffer her to have the childe divided. It muſt be ſelfiſh revenge that ſhall make two enemies deſire to ſee the ſhip ſink in which they are, rather then they will agree to preſerve it. What ſelf-denial was that in <hi>Jonah,</hi> to give himſelf up to deſtruction, rather then have the whole ſhip endangered: Every one ought to ſay, If I be the <hi>Jonah,</hi> caſt me out. Among the <hi>Romans</hi> they had a Temple dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Jovi depoſitorio,</hi> becauſe there they would go and lay aſide their mutual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions before they entred into the Senate-houſe. What a ſhame is it when many Heathens have laid aſide their mutual quarrels for the common good, and ſhall not the Miniſters of the Goſpel much more for the Churches ſafety?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="328" facs="tcp:65216:184"/>A fourth Rule is, <hi>Not to charge ſuch conſequences upon one anothers doctrine, that are not natural, and which they do abhorre.</hi> This in doctrinal diſputes hath been oil to the flame. The <hi>Lutherans</hi> charge upon the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> Doctrines about Predeſtination, <hi>That they make God the autheur of ſinne,</hi> that they make him <hi>cruel</hi> and <hi>unjuſt,</hi> worſe then <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> that commanded brick, but gave no ſtraw; yea, cruel like <hi>Nero,</hi> who, having a minde to put a veſtal Virgin to death, cauſed her to be raviſhed, and then put her to death, becauſe ſhe was <hi>raviſhed.</hi> But the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> deteſt and abhorre all ſuch conſequences, and if they did ſee ſuch concluſions did follow neceſſarily from their Doctrines, they would publickly abjure them, ſome gathered from <hi>Paul</hi>'s preaching of free-grace, that therefore men <hi>might ſinne that grace might abound</hi>; but <hi>Paul</hi> crieth, <hi>God forbid</hi> at this, and ſaith, <hi>The damnation of ſuch</hi> Logicians <hi>is juſt,</hi> Rom. 3.18.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, <hi>So farre as men do agree with us in the fundamentals, let them retain peace and concord.</hi> The Apoſtle thus exhorts <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Whereto we have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy attained, let us walk by the ſame rule.</hi> It hath been Gods mercy that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Churches, though differing in many opinions, yet do not diſſent in fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals, <hi>For as for the Socinians I do not reckon them among the Proteſtants,</hi> yea ſome place them not amongſt <hi>Chriſtians</hi>; but as for other, they keep the ſame foundation, though ſome are purer Churches then others. Now it's a ſpecial preſervative of charity to imbrace one another with hearty affections. So farre therefore it's an uncharitable and peeviſh thing in ſome <hi>Lutherans,</hi> that will not call the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> brethren, or admit of reconciliation, but profeſſe they will rather do it with the Pope, whom yet they maintain to be Antichriſt.</p>

               <bibl>JOH. 17.12.</bibl>
               <q>While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy Name.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>WE have diſpatched the prayer Chriſt put up for his Diſciples; We are now to conſider other <hi>reaſons</hi> and <hi>arguments</hi> he uſeth for his <hi>Petition.</hi> Our Saviour expreſſed many before the Petition, and ſome alſo after the Petition.</p>
            <p>The words of the Text are brought in as a reaſon, why he prayed for them now ſo ſolemnly, and not before; becauſe formerly he had <hi>kept them</hi> in a viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble manner, by his corporall preſence with them, but now the manner of his preſence being ſhortly to be changed, he therefore commends them to God, as if he ſhould have ſaid, Holy Father, ever ſince they became my Diſciples, I took a ſpecial charge of them; the world was againſt them, they could not keep themſelves, and I came as a Mediator appointed by thee, to preſerve them to eternal life, which truſt I have faithfully diſcharged, and therefore ſeeing they have hitherto been kept, let them not periſh at laſt.</p>
            <p>In this reaſon we may take notice 1. Of the Diſciples <hi>mercy</hi> vouchſafed to them, <hi>they were kept,</hi> this implieth their own inſufficiency and inability.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>efficient</hi> cauſe of this, <hi>I have kept them</hi>; wherein alſo is implied his fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity and diligence in that truſt he took upon him as a Mediatour.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The <hi>manner</hi> how, <hi>In thy Name</hi>; which mercy is illuſtrated from the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance of <hi>time, While I was with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>em.</hi> 2. Of <hi>place,</hi> while I was with them <hi>in the world.</hi> Firſt of the circumſtance of time and place, <hi>While I was with them in the world,</hi> he ſpeaks, as if for the preſent he were not with them, but that is becauſe his departure was immediatly at hand. Now when our Saviour ſpeaks in this manner, <hi>while I was with them, I kept them,</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. You muſt not think as if Chriſt by his bodily leaving of them, did alſo ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually leave them; No, this would contradict that promiſe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. where Chriſt ſaid, he would <hi>be with them to the end of the world:</hi> he did not change his preſence, but the manner of his preſence; it was before corporall and viſible, now ſpirituall and inviſible.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="330" facs="tcp:65216:185"/>2. In that Chriſt ſaid, <hi>While I was with them,</hi> it's neceſſarily inferred, that Chriſt is not <hi>corporally</hi> preſent every where; that his body is not every where, though Chriſt be every where: That is true of Chriſt in the concrete, which cannot be verified of each nature. As his Divine nature did not ſuffer, ſo neither can his humane be every where.</p>
            <p n="3">3. By this expreſſion, ſaith <hi>Auſtin</hi> upon the place, we muſt not underſtand, as if there were a <hi>viciſſitude</hi> in the Fathers and Sons keeping of us; as if the Son had kept them <hi>a while,</hi> excluding the Father; and <hi>now</hi> the <hi>Father</hi> was to keep them, excluding the <hi>Sonne</hi>; but the Father kept them even while Chriſt kept them; and Chriſt will keep them after his departure, while the Father keeps them, but not in the ſame manner; before there was a corporal viſible keeping, but now ſpiritual.</p>
            <p n="4">4. We are to avoid the <hi>Socinian</hi> reaſon given, why Chriſt ſpeaks thus in the Text: It is (ſaith he) becauſe Chriſt had not yet obtained that power and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty to keep them after an inviſible manner; for they ſay, Chriſt had not that Divine power and authority till it was given him after his reſurrection, then God gave him the univerſall dominion over all, (ſay they.) But our Saviour had ſufficiently before ſhewed, that what the Father did, he alſo did.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, When Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Hitherto I have kept them in thy Name,</hi> attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the power of keeping them to the Father, it is not as if he were not alſo God, but he ſpeaks here as <hi>Mediatour,</hi> as <hi>in the form of a ſervant,</hi> and an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour doing all things in the Fathers Name. Hence in other places he ſaith, it's not <hi>his doctrine, but his Fathers</hi>; and ſo he <hi>ſeeketh not his own glory, but the Fathers.</hi> Thus much for explication. Whereas then our Saviour for a while was in a corporall, ſenſible manner with them, providing for them and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecting of them, but at laſt is to leave them to greater hardſhip, and ſtronger temptations, Obſerve,</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Obſerv.</hi> That though God may af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford his people for a while many comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ſupports, yet they muſt not look to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies.</note>
               <hi>That though God may afford his people for a while many comfortable and ſenſible ſupports, yet they muſt not look to enjoy them alwaies.</hi> As the childe muſt not think alwaies to hang on the breaſt, or to be dandled on the knee, ſo neither muſt Gods children alwaies think to have comforts, mercies, and whatſoever their ſouls deſire, but they muſt expect changes and ſeverall trials. Hence the Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.12. they are not to think any <hi>fiery triall ſtrange.</hi> The godly are to be prepared in the midſt of their mercies, that if God on a ſudden raiſe the clean contrary, this ſhould not ſeem a new or an hard thing to them. <hi>John</hi> 21.18. Chriſt tels <hi>Peter,</hi> when he was young, he went <hi>whither he would,</hi> but in his old age, <hi>another ſhould girt him and carry him whither he would not:</hi> In his younger years he had liberty and freedom, but in his old age he ſhould meet with bonds and impriſonments. Thus God ſaith to many, in thy younger years thou hadſt health, comforts, but afterwards thou ſhalt have diſeaſes, pains,<note place="margin">What are thoſe viſible ſupports that God for a while may vouchſafe to his people.</note> and many ſad afflictions. To open this Doctrine let us conſider, what thoſe viſible ſupports are that God for a while may vouchſafe to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: And</p>
            <p n="1">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. <hi>They may have for a while many outward comforts and mercies.</hi> They may abound in wealth, in riches and honours, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o that they want nothing; they may have an heaven here, and then at laſt, God gathers black clouds, and ſo there are ſudden ſtorms and lightnings that ſpoil their ſun-ſhine day. It was thus with <hi>Job,</hi> he tels us in what plenty, honour and eaſe once he lived in, but God had made a ſad change upon him: Even as <hi>Jonah</hi> had got a <hi>gourd,</hi> whereby he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended himſelf from the ſcorching heat, and he began to think himſelf now very well, and preſently God prepared worms to devour this defence. Oh then, if there be any of Gods children on whom he thus ſmiles, they have riches when others are in the depth of poverty, they have plenty, when others are pinched with want, remember all thy wealth is but like a little duſt, if God breath on it,
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:65216:185"/>
it is ſcattered away: All theſe things runne on a wheel, and that which is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permoſt, may quickly be loweſt. As the Grecians ſay, There are no beggars, but their anceſtours have been Kings, and no Kings, but their anceſtours have been beggars; ſuch a change and mutation are all theſe earthly things ſubject unto.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. <hi>Gods children may for a while enjoy many ſweet conſolations, and have good aſſurance of Gods love,</hi> and this is a ſpeciall ſenſible ſupport. When <hi>David</hi> hath no cauſe to complain that God hid his face from him, when he ſaid, <hi>his moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain was ſtrong,</hi> when he could bleſs God, becauſe he had forgiven his ſinnes, ſo that he could with heavenly boldneſs call him his Lord, and his God, all this while <hi>David</hi> was happy; but this fair weather doth not laſt alwaies, <hi>God hideth his face, and then he is troubled,</hi> then he crieth out, <hi>Why art thou caſt down and troubled within me, O my ſoul.</hi> It is a groſs error to ſay aſſurance cannot be loſt, yea we may loſe it by our careleſs and lazy walking, and God may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive us of it for wiſe and holy ends: If then God gives thee theſe ſoul-ſenſible ſupports, that thou knoweſt and feeleſt his love upon thy ſoul, make much of this mercy, faith of evidence will not be alwaies: There will be a time when faith of adherence and dependance will be all in all.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. <hi>Then have the people of God carnall and ſenſible ſupports, when they are preſerved from the outward malice and perſecutions of men,</hi> ſo that they live ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured and proſperous lives here below. Such a time <hi>Joſeph</hi> had at laſt, <hi>David, Mordecai, Eſther,</hi> and many others; yea we ſee in <hi>Ahabs</hi> daies, when there was ſuch an hot perſecution of <hi>Eliah</hi> the Prophet, and other godly Prophets, yet <hi>Obadiah</hi> a godly man, lived in great favour with <hi>Ahab,</hi> ſo that although the rage and malice of the world be prepared againſt every holy man, yet for a while they may be the worlds darlings, they may have the Kingdoms, the Powers, and the Honours of the world, ſo that we may ſometimes ſay in this reſpect, the ſervant is above his Maſter, Chriſts Diſciple above Chriſt; only let them know, there may come a time, and then God depriveth them of all theſe, for their honours, they have diſgrace, for their glory, reproach. It's much if God lets them have the good things of this life, and of the life to come.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 4. <hi>They may have a calm and ſerene time in reſpect of ſoul-temptations and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall exerciſes. Paul</hi> had not alwaies theſe buffetings of Satan: Theſe ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall temptations, whether entring from the blackneſs of our own hearts, or injected by Satan, are very terrible and bitter, they have made the godly weary of themſelves: Hence they are compared to <hi>darts,</hi> and <hi>fiery darts,</hi> Epheſ. 6.16. to ſhew how mortall and how piercing they are. Now although God may ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times give his people a quiet, ſetled, compoſed ſpirit, yet this is not enduring, but the ſtorms do ariſe, the ſhip begins to ſink, and they cry out, that they periſh.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> 5. <hi>They may have the comfortable preſence and corporall direction of wiſe, holy and godly perſons, but at laſt God may take them away.</hi> Thus a godly people may have the miniſtry of a faithfull Paſtor, while he is with them, the flock is kept, no wolves have been able to get into the fold. Children and ſervants may have a godly Father and Maſter; wives, gracious and wiſe husbands, now theſe while they were enjoyed, were wonderfull ſupports. Hence <hi>Eliſha</hi> is called the <hi>horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> and <hi>chariots of Iſrael.</hi> When <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> was baniſhed, the people ſaid, The ſun might have been better taken out of the firmament. Thus God hath given his people many ſenſible ſupports by godly Magiſtrates, godly Miniſters, godly Fathers, godly Husbands, and while they had them all was well, as with the Diſciples while Chriſt was with them, but when the ſhepheard is ſmitten; when the pillars of the houſe are removed, oh then thy condition is a new con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, it requireth new graces, new ſtrength. While <hi>Iſmael</hi> is in his fathers
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:65216:186"/>
houſe, he will do well enough, but when caſt out of doors, there is his difficulty. Oh then if God give any of theſe viſible ſupports to you, do not think to have them alwaies; God will put you to higher exerciſes; God by degrees brings up his people to more and more hardſhip. <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.12. God there compareth his dealing with the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> to an <hi>Eagle</hi> fluttering over her neſt, and teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her young ones to fly. They ſay the Eagle doth not preſently expell her young ones, but by degrees teacheth them hardſhip, and at laſt makes them live upon the prey they get themſelves. God put not his people immediatly upon warre with their enemies, but uſed them fourty years to hardſhip in the wilderneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Reaſons why God ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times changes his peoples condition from better to worſe.</note>The grounds of this change which God may make are eminent:</p>

While we have our viſible ſupports, we cannot tell whether it be God or the creature, whether it be promiſe or ſenſe we live upon; therefore he will make thee renounce all creatures, that thou maieſt ſay, O Lord, it's not wealth, but thou in my wealth, it's not this or that mercy, but thou in the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, that my heart adheres unto. <hi>Whom have I in earth, or in heaven but thee,</hi> ſaith <hi>David.</hi> Oh this is admirable, when creature comforts and mercies hinder not the ſoul from God himſelf: when you uſe them as ladders to climb up to heaven, as <hi>Jacobs</hi> Chariot to carry you to God; when you can ſay in matter of love and affections, as the <hi>Samaritans</hi> in matter of faith, <hi>Now we believe, not for the womans ſake, but becauſe we have ſeen Chriſt himſelf.</hi> O Lord, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on thee, and live upon thee, not for my mercies ſake, not becauſe of this or that comfort and ſweetneſs, but becauſe of the infinite fulneſs that is in thy own ſelf: Or when thou canſt ſay as <hi>Paul</hi> in the matter of his doctrine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had immediate revelation from Chriſt, therefore he ſaid the eminent pillars added nothing to him; ſo in matter of practice, becauſe thou haſt enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Gods fulneſſe, the moſt excellent creatures cannot adde to thy joy.

The Lord will remove ſenſible ſupports, <hi>That we may grow up in grace, and get more ſtrength therein every day.</hi> The Scripture tels us of babes and young children, as alſo of <hi>young ſtrong men, who have overcome the wicked one.</hi> Now if we were alwaies kept at the breaſt, or with milk, we ſhould never get maſculine ſtrength, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. The Apoſtle blameth ſuch as <hi>ſtood ſtill</hi> in their <hi>firſt principles,</hi> and were not carried out to further perfection: God will not uſe his people alwaies to a tender and delicate way, they ſhall know Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is a warfare. Hence <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. they are commanded <hi>to put on the whole ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of God</hi>; and can this ſtrength and heavenly fortitude be ever put forth, if God remove not all thy ſenſible comforts, and make thee grapple with great adverſaries? God will have <hi>Job</hi> at laſt go into the field and combate with Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan and all his temptations. The windes and ſtorms ſhaking the tree, make it root the faſter, and thus God by bringing thee into hardſhip, makes thee the more ſound and ſolid Chriſtian: So that though for the preſent thou haſt no ſpirituall adverſaries upon thee, yet lay not aſide this holy armour, as the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> marched in the wilderneſs, in a warlike poſture, and their Camp exactly ordered, though for the preſent no enemy appeared.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. God will bring changes upon thee, <hi>To teach thee more experimentall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in all the waies of godlineſſe, as alſo of all the corruptions and deceitfull waies of Satan in every temptation.</hi> A man that hath been alwaies at home knoweth not what faſhions and cuſtoms are in remote Countries: <hi>Paul</hi> knew <hi>how to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound and how to want,</hi> he was acquainted with the graces and with the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of every eſtate: A Chriſtian is to grow in all ſpirituall wiſdom and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.

<pb n="333" facs="tcp:65216:186"/>

            <p n="1">1. <hi>That there was a time when the Apoſtles and Beleevers had not only a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual enjoyment of Chriſt by Faith but alſo a viſible and corporal one,</hi> viz. in that time when Chriſt was familiarly converſant with them in the fleſh, Then they ſaw Chriſt face to face, and rejoyced in him as one friend with another: Now this in it ſelf could not be but unſpeakable comfort with our own eyes to ſee Chriſt, with our own ears to hear him ſpeak, and with our own hand<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> 
               <hi>to han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle that Word of Life,</hi> as 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.1. <hi>Luk.</hi> 10 24. Our Saviour himſelf cals them <hi>bleſſed,</hi> even becauſe they lived in that age wherein they might corporally ſee him, Many Kings and Prophets have deſired to ſee and hear the things you do, Prophets though they had immediate Revelations and Viſions from God, and ſo were called <hi>Seers,</hi> yet they deſired to ſee Chriſt in his bodily preſence; And Kings though they had the temporal glory of the world to behold, yet they deſired to ſee Chriſt in the fleſh; No wonder then if it were one of the three things <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſo deſired, that he might have lived in thoſe times when Chriſt was here upon the Earth; Do but judge within your ſelves, Would you not go many miles if it were certain Chriſt were in ſuch a place teaching and working Miracles; Now the Diſciples by Chriſts viſible preſence had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny advantages, when they were in any outward ſtreights he provided for them, though he ſent them without any money upon his work, yet they confeſſed
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:65216:187"/>
they lacked nothing all that while; When they were diſcouraged with their wicked Adverſaries he comforted their hearts; When they were in any tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral danger, as when the Ship was toſſed with Tempeſts he ſaved them, and which is above all, he was a viſible Doctor and Teacher unto them, ſo that there was nothing in Religion they doubted of, but he could infallibly direct them in; It's that which the Papiſts ſo much pleade for, that there muſt be a viſible infallible Head in the Church, who is to decide matter of faith, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe there cannot be any certainty, but one will pretend to the Truth as well as another: Now the Apoſtles had ſuch a viſible Head of the Church to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect them, though we have none now, but the Spirit of God by the Word doth direct and guide ſuch as walk humbly: Oh what a Treaſure was this, That an Apoſtle could not have one doubt upon his heart, any ſcruple in his Conſcience, any doubt about any Text in the Old Teſtament, but he had an infallible Prophet to go to who could teach him all things! Thus there was a time of outward viſible enjoying of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>But 2. <hi>This outward viſible enjoying of Chriſt was not of any advantage at all, if there had not been alſo a ſpiritual beleeving on him</hi>; It was not the ſeeing, the hearing, the living with him made a man happy, but the ſpiritual receiving of him as a Mediatour; Did not <hi>Iudas</hi> live with him in this kinde, was not he as a familiar Friend with him, yet for all that he was a Sonne of Perdition? Hence our Saviour upon all occaſions took them off from attending to ſuch viſible advantages, as <hi>Luke</hi> 11.27. when they cried out, <hi>Bleſſed is the womb that bare Chriſt, and the paps that gave him ſuck</hi>: He corrected this, and ſaid, <hi>Bleſſed are they that hear the Word of God and do it</hi>; So that the very Mother of Chriſt was more bleſſed in conceiving Chriſt in her heart by Faith, then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving him in her womb, So <hi>Mar.</hi> 3.35. when they told him his Mother and Brethren were to ſeek him, he anſwered, <hi>Whoſoever doth the will of God, the ſame is my Mother and Brother</hi>; So that now all ſuch corporall conſiderations are to vaniſh, and ſpirituall Arguments are to take place; Even as when Chriſt left his Diſciples bodily, then the Spirit of God came powerfully upon them. If then we would duely improve Chriſt as a Mediatour, we are to be a ſpirituall people, our hearts, deſires, and aims muſt be wholly ſpirituall; But this is <hi>too great a leſſon for any natural man,</hi> he cannot make any uſe of Chriſt, but after a fleſhly carnal manner one way or other; The life of Faith is as much above them as reaſon is above a Beaſt; The <hi>natural man cannot receive them becauſe spiritually diſcerned,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.14. Therefore wicked men are called <hi>ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall,</hi> and are compared to <hi>brute beaſts,</hi> which are wholly carried out by ſence.</p>

Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> where the Papiſts hold the Bread and Wine to be really turned into the body and bloud of Chriſt, that it's no longer bread or Wine but Chriſts body and bloud; Therefore they look not up to Chriſt in heaven by Faith, but to Chriſt in the Sacrament, as if his corporal being there were all in all; Inſomuch that all the affection and devotion they put forth in a Sacrament is wholly viſible and carnal; They worſhip it as if the body of Chriſt were there; They ſet it up to be ſeen that all may bodily fall down and worſhip; Thus all is done in a corporal manner, and whereas of old it was <hi>ſurſum corda,</hi> now it is <hi>deorſum corda</hi>; None are more devoid of ſpirituall Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding then thoſe that are thus buſied in a viſible carnal way of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>

Hence <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of a <hi>Jew in the fleſh,</hi> and in the <hi>Letter,</hi> and a <hi>Iew in the Spirit,</hi> Rom 2. and all the Jewiſh rites are called <hi>carnal Ordinances,</hi> and <hi>beggarly</hi>; They bring no real good to them that are exerciſed therein without the Spirit, and may we not ſay, that almoſt all Chriſtianity is but a religious carnality, a reſting and relying upon Ordinances ſo farre as they are bodily and viſibly performed; When the Apoſtle 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. had ſaid, Baptiſm ſerveth to prevent all miſtakes, he addeth, <hi>Not the waſhing of the body but the anſwer of a good conſcience</hi>; When a man upon good examination of himſelf can ſay, O Lord, thou knoweſt that I do in truth and uprightneſs keep to thoſe duties I am ſolemnly by Baptiſm engaged unto; Thus for the Lords Supper, is not it the very receiving of it jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the very ſaving of men? Do not commonly people take it as if in the very bread and wine there were ſome Sacrifical vertue, as when they take Phyſick they judge ſome Phyſical inherent vertue in that to help them; Oh what <hi>Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi> hath his head full enough of water to bewail this carnall, groſſe, and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant Chriſtianity that is in the world, which judgeth the very Sacraments, or any bodily worſhip in praiers or ſinging of Pſalmes, though they be but as Parrats in theſe things, to be great evidences for heaven; But as the body without the ſoul is dead and a lothſome Carkaſſe, thus is all thy Religion, worſhip, and Ordinances a dead lothſome thing in the preſence of God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Spirit; This the Apoſtle cals ſerving of God in the oldneſſe of the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, not the newneſſe of the Spirit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.6. And in this ſence we may ſay the <hi>Letter</hi> killeth and damneth, but the <hi>Spirit</hi> giveth life; Oh then be afraid thou art not one of thoſe that ſplit their ſouls at this Rock; This is the common poiſon that devoureth moſt; Even as the Scripture ſpeaks contemptibly of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Army, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 31.3. <hi>They are fleſh and not spirit</hi>; The ſame may be ſaid of all that Religion and devotion which moſt put confidence in: But yet take heed of another extream errour that crieth down the Ordinances, and under pretence of a ſpirituall high attainment, which they think they have, wholly lay aſide theſe viſible Ordinances and performances which Chriſt hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in his Church till the end of the world.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 4. <hi>Then men would have Chriſt after a viſible manner when they pretend Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations and Miracles</hi>; For what is this but to leave the Word and the promiſes as if that were not ſufficient, God indeed hath condeſcended to ſupport ſence, as when he vouchſafed Miracles in the Infancy of the Church, yea, the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments he hath appointed are a kinde of relief to our ſence, he conſidered our weakneſſe in appointing ſuch viſible Signs, but when we are not contented with
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:65216:188"/>
Gods Inſtitutions but deſired ſuch ſenſible ſupports, which he will not afford, <hi>This proceeds from a carnal diſpoſition</hi> in us, This is the cauſe in Popery why they tell us of ſuch miraculous apparitions, they will tell you of Crucifixes bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, of Chriſts viſible appearing, of ſuch great wonders done upon the Invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of ſuch and ſuch Saints, and all this is to humour the carnal part of a man, for ſpiritual things are ſupernatural and very hard and difficult to fleſh and bloud.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>This is to know Chriſt after a corporal manner, when we profeſſe his Truth, and acknowledge his waies only for earthly advantages,</hi> as he ſaid, <hi>Fac me Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pum Romanum &amp; ere Chriſtianus</hi>; Thus they did of whom <hi>Paul</hi> made menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with <hi>weeping, that they were enemies to the Croſſe of Chriſt, that their God was their belly, that they minded earthly things,</hi> Phil. 3.19. Such Diſciples were thoſe that followed Chriſt <hi>becauſe of the Loaves</hi>; Now the Lord Chriſt he cals to ſuch duties that are oppoſite to fleſh and bloud, that are againſt the incilination of our nature; <hi>To pull out the right eye, To deny our ſelves, To take up the Croſs,</hi> We are not to be of thoſe that love Chriſts Crown of gold but not his Crown of Thorns: How greatly did <hi>Mahumetan</hi> Religion prevail, by ſuch Doctrines as were pleaſing to the corrupt inclinations and ſinful pleaſures of men, and becauſe Chriſts Doctrine was accompanied with ſo much difficulty.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, There is in the godly ſometimes an inordinate deſire after Chriſt in a ſenſible manner, and that is <hi>when they cannot reſt upon the promiſes,</hi> beleeve on Gods Word barely unleſſe they have alſo evident and ſenſible Conſolations: Bare acts of depending faith and conſtant waitings on God in the way of his promiſe argue thee to be more ſpiritual in thy Chriſtian warfare.</p>

A peculiar care of them.</note> For they are ſaid to be given to Chriſt out of the world that he may keep them; This giving of them to Chriſt ſuppoſeth an Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction or choice of ſuch from all others; God is a preſerver and keeper of all, <hi>Iob</hi> 7.20. called therefore the <hi>preſerver of men</hi>: Yea <hi>Pſa.</hi> 36.6. he is ſaid to <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve man and beaſt</hi>; God is every where <hi>eſſentiâ, preſentiâ,</hi> and <hi>potentiâ,</hi> and thus he cannot but be every where, but he hath a gracious preſence with his Children, which is not from his <hi>infiniteneſſe</hi> or <hi>neceſſity,</hi> but from his meer love, ſo that if God were not infinite and immenſe (pardon the Suppoſition) yet his grace and goodneſſe would make him abide and dwell with thoſe that are his; You ſee by this that Gods keeping extends even to inanimate Creatures, he keepeth the very Sparrows that they fall not to the ground, but there is a more excellent and choice way of preſervation to thoſe that are given in ſpeciall charge to Chriſt; <hi>The eyes of the Lord are ſaid to runne to and fro in the behalf of the upright in heart,</hi> 2 Chron. 16 9. What can be more comfortable then that expreſſion; Hence the Lords peculiar is compared to a Bird flying over the neſt where her young ones are, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 31.5. Only the Bird is ſilly and weak, hath no power to defend, but ſhe ſheweth her deſire and affection; Thus God is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to compare himſelf, to encourage our Faith, for we are apt to look more at what is againſt us then for us; We conſider the devils Subtlety, the worlds danger, our own corruptions, but do not attend to Gods mercifull Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>This phraſe doth imply the ſafety that the people of God are in,</hi>
               <note place="margin">IV. The ſafety they are in.</note> For though in reſpect of the world and their Corruptions, they may ſay with <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>hoſaphat, A great Army is againſt us and we know not what to do,</hi> or they may be afraid as the man <hi>Eliſha</hi> led into the midſt of the Enemies Camp, yet for al this they are ſafe, for there is a fourfold cord that holds in them, which cannot eaſily be broken; There is firſt <hi>Chriſts power</hi> which is omnipotent, the ſame with the Fathers power, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10. <hi>I and my Father are one</hi>; None can take them
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:65216:190"/>
out of Chriſts hands, becauſe none can take them out of the Fathers hand; Therefore <hi>Col.</hi> 3. their life is ſaid <hi>to be hid with Chriſt in God</hi>: And it is a crown laid up in heaven; Now what men or devils can break into Heaven? Who can rob and ſteal from thence? if there be a ſtronger then God, more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful then God, then doubt of thy preſervation but elſe not.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There is his <hi>fidelity</hi> and <hi>immutability,</hi> He is the <hi>Amen,</hi> He is the <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> for we might think, though we are never ſo well to day as it was with <hi>Adam,</hi> and the Angels apoſtatizing, yet we may be undone to morrow, we may alter or Chriſt may alter, No, he is <hi>faithfull and true,</hi> He is Chriſt <hi>to day, yeſterday, and for ever,</hi> Heb. 13.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There is his <hi>love and compaſſion</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for this quickens both power and fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and ſets all on work; It is his love to us that will not let his people pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, and certainly if he loved his Children ſo as to die for them, and that when they were ſinners, then it follows invincibly that he will do that for us which is leſſe then death; It is but ſpeaking the word, whereas before it coſt him many a praier and ſtrong cry, it put him in agonies, and made him ſweat drops of bloud; Again it is otherwiſe with us then formerly, When we are Enemies he died for us, and now being reconciled how much rather wil he fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh what he bath begun, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5</p>
            <p n="4">4. There is his <hi>wiſedom,</hi> for though there be power and love, yet through imprudence we ſee amongſt men it often miſcarrieth, but now in Chriſt are <hi>hid the treaſures of all wiſedom</hi>; And <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9. he is called the <hi>Counſellor,</hi> as having wiſedom to direct, and power to deliver in all the ſad Trials they are plunged into; He is called often <hi>the wiſedom of the Father</hi>; Now then put all theſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, Omnipotent Power, unſearchable Wiſedom, Infinite Love and Immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Fidelity, and you muſt conclude that the godly mans ſafety is firmer then Mount <hi>Zion</hi> or the Earth that God hath eſtabliſhed, for they may be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, but theſe cannot be no more then Chriſt, Chriſt and they will ſtand or fall together.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">V. It implies an Obligetion on Chriſt to keep them.</note>And laſtly, (becauſe more is to be ſaid to this in the words following) this implieth a ſtrong tye and obligation <hi>upon Chriſt to keep them,</hi> for they are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him as Sheep to the Shepherd, and as <hi>Jacob</hi> was to anſwer for every torn or killed one, ſo muſt Chriſt; They are given him to keep, as <hi>Benjamin</hi> was to his Brethren; Look (ſaith <hi>Jacob) you ſee not my face unleſſe you bring him ſafe</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Inſomuch that if Chriſt ſhould not preſerve thoſe that are given him, all the glory of his Mediatourſhip will fall to the ground, You ſee how he decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth his diligence, <hi>None is loſt,</hi> For if he had loſt ſome of them, then had not Chriſt gone through with the work of Redemption, and ſo could not expect the glory he praied for, neither could he have ſaid, <hi>I have finiſhed the work thou haſt given me,</hi> yea, it would have behoved him to come and die again, to be crucified again, if he had not by <hi>one Oblation once perfected for ever the Godly,</hi> Heb. 10 14.</p>

Will Chriſt be an unfaithfull Steward? It lieth upon Chriſt more then thee that thou beeſt preſerved; Is not Chriſts honour and glory more then the ſalvation of thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands ſuch as thou art? Now if thou ſhouldſt periſh and not get to Heaven, it would be Chriſts diſhonour; It would be becauſe he was not either able or willing; Indeed thou art to walk with an holy fear or trembling, thou art to deſpair in thy ſelf, but thy faith and confidence in Chriſts ſtrength ſhould make thee couragious, Stronger is he that is with thee then he that is againſt thee: It is true, thy corruptions are ſtrong, thy Temptations are ſtrong, but Chriſt is

ſtronger, Live not with ſuch anxious fears as a <hi>Cain</hi> fearing every thing may kill and damn thee; Interpoſe Chriſt between thee and all fears and dangers, Say, you may overcome me but can you Chriſt?</p>
            <p>In the next place we come to the <hi>manner</hi> how he kept them, <hi>In thy Name</hi>; And here <hi>name</hi> may be taken in all the ſignifications mentioned in the former Verſe, But I will not trouble you with that; This may be ſpoken in a two-fold reſpect; Either to ſhew what kinde of preſervation it was, <hi>viz.</hi> not a corporal or carnal one, (though he was bodily preſent among them,) but a ſpirituall one in the <hi>name</hi> of God; He did not keep them, as the powers of the world keep their Subjects by the outward force of the Sword, but as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid of the Miniſtry, <hi>Our weapons are not carnall but spirituall,</hi> So was Chriſts defence, or elſe it might be ſpoken by way of <hi>humility,</hi> for Chriſt in reſpect of his <hi>office</hi> was <hi>inferiour to the Father</hi>; And therefore he ſpeaks of himſelf in this Chapter as one ſent, or an Embaſſadour from the Father, who is to doe all things in his Name, and to follow his will only, in this latter ſence we take it principally,</p>
            <p>Obſ. <hi>That if the Lord Chriſt though God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Doct.</hi> If Chriſt though God, yet in reſpect of his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry doth at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute all to God, how much more ought the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the Goſpel who are frail men.</note> 
               <hi>yet in reſpect of his office and Miniſtry doth attribute all to God, how much more ought the Miniſters of the Goſpel who are frail ſinful men</hi>; Shall Chriſt ſay, he kept them by the Fathers power? Shall he ſay, It's not my Doctrine but the Fathers? Shall he ſay, <hi>I ſeek not my own glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but the glory of him that ſent me?</hi> How much more ought the Officers God hath appointed in the Church take their Auditors off from them, and carry them to God wholly; It is Obſervable, That Chriſt did ſtill inform his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and Hearers to look up unto the Father, and the Apoſtles they labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to take off beleevers from applauding of them but to look up to God; Thus <hi>Paul</hi> 2 Cor. 3.5, 6. even when he advanceth his Miniſtry to the Higheſt, yet left men ſhould therewithall advance the perſons put thereinto (as <hi>Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſins</hi> ſaid of <hi>Tully</hi> that he commended Eloquence to the Heavens, that he himſelf might be lifted up with it) See what corrective expreſſions he uſeth, <hi>Not that we are ſufficient of our ſelves to think any thing, our ſufficiency is of God</hi>; All is attributed to God; <hi>Paul</hi> though endowed with ſo many excellent gifts, yet ſaith of himſelf, he is not able to think, he doth not ſay to doe, to convert and change mens hearts, but he cannot think, and he doth not ſay he cannot think ſome choice, ſublime, admirable thing, but he cannot think any thing, the leaſt thought in reference to the ſalvation of others; And therefore he addeth <hi>ver.</hi> 6. It is God that hath made us able Miniſters; The Miniſters of God may as well ſay they create the world, They work Miracles by their own power, as ſay, they enlighten the mindes, or ſoften the hearts of thoſe to whom they preach; Thus 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5. When the people through vanity did reſt too much upon the Officers of the Church, and attributed that to them which belonged to Chriſt: <hi>Paul</hi> doth ſeverely expoſtulate with them, 1 <hi>Corin.</hi> 1.13. <hi>Was</hi> Paul <hi>Crucified for you? Were you Baptized in the Name of</hi> Paul? <hi>What are theſe but Miniſters by whom ye beleeve?</hi> Two errours in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme we are to avoid,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That becauſe the Miniſtry cannot do any thing without God, therefore we deſpiſe it and neglect it as too many do; This is to oppoſe the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall and the Inſtrument: They will not do ſo in naturall things, though man doth not live by materiall bread alone, but by the Word of God, yet they will not throw away that Food as needleſſe, unprofitable, and unneceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; Why then will they do ſo to the immaterial food and heavenly manna of the Word.</p>
            <p>The other extream is, To advance it too much, To ſet up the Inſtrument to the neglect of the Principall, and that is when we ſo reſt on and admire the Gifts, Learning, Elocution, or parts of the Miniſter, that we look not up to God, and this we are prone unto; Therefore the Apoſtle gives a large

Commendation to the <hi>The ſſalonians,</hi> 1 Theſſal. 2.13. That they received the Word <hi>Not as the Word of man, but as of God,</hi> which effectually worketh in Beleevers, <hi>John</hi> 4. It's ſaid of <hi>Johns</hi> Hearers, That they did a while rejoyce in his light, They flocked after his Miniſtry, yet afterwards they quarelled with him, and ſaid, He had a Devil; Thus <hi>Ezech.</hi> 33.32. He was to the Jews a very lovely Song, They loved to hear him, they came thronging in great Multitudes and Companies unto him, but yet they would not do any thing.</p>

Here was more then the Miniſters Study, then the Miniſters Gifts, for Gods mighty heart-changing power did alſo work on me; Oh the Convictions, the meltings, the burnings and changes of heart that were upon me!

            <p>IN the former part of the verſe, you heard our Saviour expreſſing, that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious priviledge of Protection and Preſervation of his Diſciples, and ſo all that were given him in the midſt of all dangers to eternal life. Now our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour amplifieth the fidelity and diligence he uſed in this cuſtody.</p>
            <p>So that in the words we may obſerve Chriſts <hi>diligence</hi> and <hi>fidelity</hi> expreſſed, <hi>I have kept them.</hi>

            <p n="3">3. His <hi>fidelity</hi> in <hi>preſervation</hi> is illuſtrated by the <hi>ſigne</hi> or <hi>effect</hi> of it, <hi>None of them is periſhed.</hi>

            <p>All theſe particulars contain ſolid and ſubſtantial Divinity, both Doctrinal and Practical. They will ſerve to confute falſe Doctrines, and reprove wicked converſations. And</p>

               </gap>, which the Septuagint make often to anſwer the Hebrew word <hi>Shamar,</hi> which ſignifieth to keep with all diligence and circumſpection. In the New Teſtament, it's many times uſed of a corporal violent detaining in priſon, as <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> is to hale to priſon, <hi>Act</hi> 22.19. but when it's applied in a ſpiritual ſenſe, it ſignifieth a diligent ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving of a command, or more frequently, a carefull preſerving of our ſelves from ſinne, as <hi>Luke</hi> 12.15 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.21. And hence comes the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.5. <hi>They made broad their phylacteries,</hi> called ſo, becauſe by them they were warned to take heed of ſinne: But in the Text it's uſed for protection and preſervation to everlaſting happineſs, as <hi>John</hi> 12.25. onely we

may obſerve the uſe of it in three places very fit to our matter in hand.</p>
            <p>It's applied to Shepherds diligently watching to their ſheep, and that in the night time, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.8. and thus <hi>Homer</hi> uſeth it alſo; and hereby is repreſented that Chriſt is that chief Shepherd, which will keep his ſheep, though never ſo infirm or weak, that no danger ſhall befall them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It's applied to the keeping of ſome precious thing depoſited in our hands, that we are betruſted with, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.20. and thus alſo all the godly are deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Chriſt as his charge, that none be loſt.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Laſtly, It's uſed of preſerving in a ſafe place in the midſt of dangers. Thus <hi>Noah</hi> is ſaid to be kept in the Ark, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5. which is notably true in all the godly. The deluge of Gods wrath fals upon all the wicked of the world, and the godly are kept ſafe in Chriſt, as <hi>Noah</hi> was in the Ark, whereas then our Saviour doth ſo often inform his Diſciples, that he keepeth them.

It's from <hi>Predeſtination, that nothing can ſeparate us from the love of God in Chriſt.</hi> Rom. 11. <hi>It's Election hath obtained,</hi> that elected remnant ſhall never periſh; and thus in this prayer of our Saviours, all ſecurity of the godly, it's becauſe the <hi>Father had given them to Chriſt,</hi> viz. by Election, as the root and ſource of all their good; This is ſo cogent a truth, that many who hold a fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling away from true grace, do yet maintain, That no Elect man can ever periſh finally, becauſe then God ſhould be fruſtrated of his purpoſe, and the counſel of man ſhould make void the counſell of God. This Election of God, is the vivificall cauſe of all Preſervation. As by this they were Called and Converted from a ſtate of ſinne, Election did bring them in; ſo the ſame Election, when they are Converted, doth protect and keep them, if they fall, doth raiſe and repair them, whereby they ſafely at laſt arrive at Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; ſo that their Perſeverance is not a merit, or reward of their former holineſſe, but it's a free gift of God, and an effect of Election, as their effectual Vocation was.</p>
            <p>The ſecond externall Principle is, <hi>The Covenant and Promiſe of God made in Chriſt to the Godly:</hi> So that the Covenant of Grace being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by Chriſts death, <hi>In whom the Promiſes are Yea and Amen,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.20. being among other glorious ends, to perpetuate and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue the work of Grace in them; it's impoſſible, that hell, or the world ſhould quite put them out of the way to Heaven, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 32.40. God there promiſeth an <hi>Everlaſting Covenant, a Covenant that ſhall abide for ever</hi>; And what is the Priviledge vouchſafed in that Deed of Gift? <hi>It's the putting his fear in their heart, that they ſhall not depart from him.</hi> You ſee by this notable place, That it's not we our ſelves, but God who keepeth us; and for this we have his Promiſe: So that the godly may triumph in an holy Confidence becauſe of it: Many other Promiſes that are branches of this Covenant, the Scripture declareth, which ſhould be <hi>ſweeter then the honey, and the honey-comb:</hi> For what can be more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to hear, then that God will ſafely preſerve thee in the way to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, ſo that no fraud or force without, nor any luſt or corruption within ſhall hinder thee of the Crown of Glory. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 40.29, 30, 31. <hi>He giveth power to the faint, and to them that have no might he increaſeth ſtrength,</hi> &amp;c. God in the verſe before is ſaid Himſelf not to faint, or to be weary: Though he created the Earth, and doth ſtill preſerve it, yet he is not weary, and becauſe he is thus, he will make his people ſo: They in themſelves may be fainting and weary, but he will renew ſtrength: And he illuſtrateth this from natural ſtrength, Though <hi>young men</hi> in their full ſtrength may be weary, yet theſe ſhall not. And again, he compareth their ſtrength to the <hi>Eagle</hi> that mounteth up with wings to the Heaven, and is not weary. Thus God will enable the godly ſoul: Though they runne, or walk, they ſhall not be weary; What a reviving place ſhould this be to the dead, dull, and languiſhing believer? Why do I lie grovel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the ground? Let me flie up to Heaven like an Eagle. We have alſo a remarkable Promiſe of Divine Protection, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 4.5, 6. where God by two ſimilitudes doth notably declare it, Firſt, by an alluſion to that wonderfull Preſervation of the people of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> It was not enough, that
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:65216:193"/>
God had brought them out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> they would have periſhed for all that, without his Protection; Therefore we may reade the Hiſtory, <hi>Exod.</hi> 13. how God created a directive Protection for them, both by day and night. In the day time, there was a <hi>Cloud and ſmoak, and a ſhining fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming fire by night.</hi> Thus God promiſeth he will do upon every dwelling-place in <hi>Zion,</hi> and upon her Aſſemblies; by theſe are figured the ſeveral Churches that are aſſembled to ſerve God, <hi>For upon all, the Glory ſhall be a defence</hi>; By Glory, is meant the <hi>Ark,</hi> which is here made a Type of Gods people, and they may be called Gods Glory, both becauſe they glory in God, and God is glorified by them: So that the meaning is, Look what care and defence God did once ſhow to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them from periſhing in the Wilderneſſe, that they might be brought to <hi>Canaan</hi>; The ſame, not in a miraculous viſible way, but in a ſpirituall and inviſible manner will God do to his Church. The ſecond ſimilitude is from <hi>Shepherds,</hi> who in thoſe hot Countreys, did erect Tabernacles and Cottages for their flock, to defend them againſt the heat, and all other ſtorms; By this is ſignified, That God would create ſuch defence for his ſheep againſt all kinde of dangers and calamities, that they periſh not, therefore in all our extremities; We have four ſtrong pillars to bear us up.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The effects which a lively meditation of this preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce.</note>In the next place, Let us take notice of the bleſſed effects, which a lively me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation on this preſervation will produce; It's worth the time to be improving this truth. For</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, <hi>Hereby an holy boldneſſe and confidence will keep up our hearts againſt all dangers and diſcouragements.</hi> The people of God are ſubject to faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſwouning fits; Their fears and cares make them feeble. Oh then what a cordiall and reviver will this truth be to us?<note place="margin">Boldneſſe againſt all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements.</note> Though I am weak and cannot preſerve my ſelf, yet I am in the arms of him that both can and will; a Childe in a Gyants arms is ſafe enough from falling: We ſee <hi>David</hi> in many <hi>Pſalms</hi> acknowledging his confidence and boldneſſe, even challenging all the world, <hi>Though the earth be removed into the ſea, and though an army of men ſhould encamp him round about, yet he would not be afraid, becauſe he truſted in God</hi>; and he often ſpeaks of Gods <hi>right-hand holding him up</hi>; Oh what a ſupport is that, Gods right-hand! There is more ſtrength in that, then in all the creatures combined together: So that if not onely Devils, but all creatures elſe, good and bad, ſhould combine againſt thee, yet to Gods right-hand, they are but as tow to the fire. Thou canſt no more fall then God himſelf can be weary and faint. The <hi>Heathens</hi> ſaid of their feigned <hi>Atlas,</hi> whom they made to bear up the Heavens, that he muſt not ſo much as ſtoop, if he did, the Heavens would fall down im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately. To be ſure, if God for a moment onely ſhould with-draw his arm, not only believers, but even the Angels in Heaven would fall into hell; if there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou didſt by faith reſt thy ſelf on this Protection, thy life would be a ſweet, gracious and compoſed life.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, <hi>The conſideration of Chriſts Protection would make us go out of our ſelves, and renounce all our own power.</hi> To truſt in the arm of fleſh for temporal deliverances, is great <hi>Idolatry</hi>; but to truſt in the duties or gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the ſoul for ſpiritual mercies, is much more abominable <hi>Idolatry</hi>; for it's more peculiar and proper to God, and belongs to him as his one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly glory, to juſtifie and ſave us, then to defend and preſerve us corporal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. This Preſervation then of us is the onely thing to humble us, to put us in remembrance of our own impotency and ſinfulneſſe, Thoſe many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to help thee, are ſo many demonſtrations of thy own infirmities. We are never nearer falling, then when we begin to truſt in our ſelves; When
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:65216:193"/>
               <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>Though all men forſake thee, yet I will not,</hi> then is he moſt prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to forſake and deny Chriſt: So that this Doctrine of Chriſts Protection is a ſelf-debaſing and ſelf-emptying truth, it makes us ſee our own poverty and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe, and thereby flie ſolely to him.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>The conſideration of this Preſervation will make us readily and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly ſet upon all thoſe duties God cals us to.</hi> We will not ſhrink from them, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Oh they are too hard, too difficult! We cannot go through with them! What made the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> diſpond upon new dangers? but becauſe they remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred not the miraculous power of Gods preſence with them, they thought eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing great but God. Their enemies they looked upon as great enemies, but not on God as a great God. We ſee this ſinfull fear in <hi>Moſes</hi> alſo, How many excuſes did he pretend, that he might not be imployed in that em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſage to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> till Gods wrath was kindled at him? Therefore if we did with faith conſider Chriſts power, though our duties were great, though never ſo contrary to fleſh and bloud, yet in the name of God we would go out and do valiantly.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>The powerfull meditation of this would prevent a thouſand doubts and fears that we uſually make about what may be.</hi> We do not remember our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours Rule, <hi>That ſufficient to the day is the evil thereof,</hi> and therefore we excru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate our ſelves with ſuppoſed future conditions, not conſidering, that as our neceſſities and infirmities ſhall abound: ſo Gods preſervation will: The godly man thinks, What if I ſhould be bereaved of ſuch ſenſible helps, an Husband, or ſome able friend, or my eſtate loſt? How ſhould I ſubſiſt with many chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren? Or how if I ſhould be called to Martyrdom, to be impriſoned, to loſe my life? Such is my weakneſs (ſaith the believer) that I fear I ſhould with <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> deny and forſwear, do any thing rather then endure extremity? Oh but whence are all the confuſions of thy ſoul, but becauſe we remember not Chriſts protection and preſence is with us!</p>
            <p>Laſtly, <hi>The lively faith of this Protection will keep us in a carefull diligent walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſuch wayes, wherein God vouchſafeth his preſence. Work out your ſalvation</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>for it's God that worketh in you to will and do.</hi> Preſumption on Gods power breeds ſecurity and lazineſs; but faith in Gods power takes Gods way. Chriſt becauſe he depended on God, would not tempt God in unlawfull wayes.</p>
            <p>Uſe of Thankfulneſs: Oh call upon thy ſoul to bleſs God for every moments preſervation! God kept thy heart, thy eyes, thy tongue to day, what ſhops and inſtruments of wickedneſs would they have been elſe? That thou goeſt not to bed, as if it were into an hell; That thou art not full of gaſhes and wounds by ſin; Bleſs God that hath kept thee cloſe to him.</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>JOH. 17.12.</bibl>
               <q>Thoſe thou haſt given me, I have kept, and none of them is periſhed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>WE have conſidered the faithfulneſſe and diligence Chriſt ſhewed in the preſervation of his to eternall life, expreſſed in that word, [<hi>I have kept.</hi>] The next thing in order is the ſubject preſerved, <hi>Thoſe thou haſt given me</hi>; but becauſe this expreſſion doth once more, even the ſixt time come in, <hi>ver.</hi> 34. I ſhall paſſe it over till then: I ſhall therefore proceed to the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> particular, which is the effect, or a ſign rather whereby he proveth his faithfull protection of them, <hi>None of them is periſhed.</hi> The words are empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall, <hi>None,</hi> he doth not ſay all but one or two, but <hi>none</hi>; for as for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance following, [<hi>but the ſon of perdition</hi>] we ſhall ſhew you, that is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptive, but adverſative; becauſe it's ſaid, none of thoſe that are given him periſh: now though in ſome ſenſe <hi>Judas</hi> was given to Chriſt as an Apoſtle, and in reſpect of his Office Chriſt ſaid he had choſen twelve, yet he was never given in the ſenſe it is uſed, <hi>ver.</hi> 2. where ſuch are ſaid to have eternal life. The laſt aggravation is, <hi>None of them is periſhed,</hi> he doth not ſay none of them hath been killed by perſecutors, or none of them have grievouſly fallen by ſinne, for ſo <hi>Peter</hi> did, but none is periſhed; he ſpeaks in the preſent tenſe, not none <hi>ſhall</hi> periſh, but <hi>is</hi> periſhed, as if becauſe they were not already periſhed, they ſhould never, or rather, becauſe in reſpect of Gods promiſe, it was as ſure as if they were already in heaven: Even as <hi>Judas</hi> is ſaid in the Text to be periſhed, although he was not yet in hell; he was not yet gone to his proper place, but becauſe of the certainty of it. This expreſſion was ſo remarkable, that <hi>Chap.</hi> 18.9. we have mention made of it as a famous ſaying, <hi>That the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing might be fulfilled, of thoſe thou haſt given me I have loſt none:</hi> only whereas in the text it is expreſſed paſſively, <hi>none is periſhed</hi>; there it's active, <hi>I have loſt none</hi>; but that change of the word is very comfortable, for thereby is ſignified, that if any did periſh, it would be becauſe of ſome fault in him, if they be loſt, it is he hath loſt them. Though ſinne and the devil ſhould inſtrumentally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy them, yet it would be principally attributed to his want of love, or power or faithfulneſſe in his truſt. In the text one word is to be obſerved, and that is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>is periſhed:</hi> The word is uſed ſometimes of a corporall and temporall deſtruction, <hi>Judg.</hi> 12.11. <hi>They periſhed in the gainſaying of Core.</hi> 1 Pet. 3.6.

Sometimes it's uſed of a ſpirituall deſtruction, in reſpect of the ſoul by everlaſting damnation; Now the word doth here take in both the ſenſes, ſpirituall deſtruction as the principall, and temporall as the ſecondary; for that this is partly implied ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, <hi>cap.</hi> 18.9. <hi>I am he ye ſeek, let theſe go,</hi> and then follows, <hi>that none may periſh:</hi> In reſpect of the firſt deſtruction it is chiefly that the devil hath his

               </gap>, <hi>Revel.</hi> 9.11. onely you muſt obſerve, that when the Scripture uſeth this word in a ſpiritual ſenſe for a loſt man in ſoul and body, it ſpeaks of a twofold undone condition; Firſt, There are ſome in a loſt, periſhing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, but yet <hi>recoverable</hi> by the grace of God; they are as <hi>Moſes</hi> drawn out of the water, where certain death would have been, and thus all the godly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their converſion, are loſt. Thus <hi>Matth</hi> 18.11. Chriſt is ſaid to come, <hi>that he might ſave ſuch as were loſt</hi>; he did not come to ſave a loſt <hi>Judas,</hi> or ſuch as were from all eternity, left by God in their undone condition, but thoſe elect perſons, that for the preſent were in a loſt eſtate. Thus <hi>Luke</hi> 15.24. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal ſonne is ſaid to be loſt or periſhed, but he was recovered again. The other ſenſe is, when it's applied to ſuch as are in an undone eſtate irrecoverably. They are in a ſtate of periſhing, and will never be brought out of it; and thus it's applied to <hi>Judas.</hi> Thus it's uſed 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. <hi>The Goſpel is a ſweet ſavour to thoſe that are ſaved,</hi> and in <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>thoſe that periſh,</hi> where it's oppoſed to <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. The words thus explained, Obſerve,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That none of thoſe who are elected, or given by the Father to Chriſt, ſhall periſh.</hi>

                  <hi>Obſerv.</hi>
               </note> They will be enabled to perſevere; They will certainly get to the haven. This is a principal truth in Divinity; and as it is much oppugned by learned Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, ſo it hath alſo great influence into our lives practically, and therefore I ſhall be the larger on this ſubject; and before I come to explicate it, it's good to compare two other Texts with this, as excellent parallels.</p>
            <p>The firſt is <hi>John</hi> 6.39. <hi>This is the Fathers will</hi>; where you have the truth aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted, and that very powerfully.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He ſaith, <hi>He will loſe nothing of what the Father hath given him</hi>; He doth not ſay, he will loſe none, but nothing <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, not any thing, neither his ſoul, nor his body, and therefore becauſe the body, when conſumed to duſt, ſeemeth to be for ever loſt, he addeth, <hi>I will raiſe it up at the laſt day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. This is ſo great a matter, that he ſaith, <hi>This is the will of his Father that ſent him</hi>; So that the main command to be received from the Father, and the great thing willed was, to let none of the elect periſh.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Text is <hi>John</hi> 10.28. where ſpeaking of this property of his ſheep, that they <hi>hear his voice,</hi> he addeth, <hi>I give unto them eternal life, and they ſhall never periſh.</hi> Here you ſee the expreſſion for the future, leſt it might be objected againſt this in the Text, though none is periſhed yet, yet he may when new temptations and dangers ariſe, then they may be undone. <hi>Judas</hi> did not immediately upon his Diſcipleſhip betray Chriſt; but our Saviour ſaith, <hi>None ſhall periſh,</hi> and he giveth a ſufficient cauſe of this their perſeverance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are <hi>in his Fathers hand</hi>; Here is the dear reſpect God beareth to them, and then <hi>none is ſtronger then the Father:</hi> So that you muſt finde out a power greater then Gods, and more prevailing then his arm, if you will hold they can periſh. Thus you ſee this truth confirmed by the mouth of two faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full witneſſes. But becauſe this truth is of ſingular uſe, and of much difficulty.<note place="margin">Introductory Propoſitions.</note>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall firſt lay down many introductory particulars to the ſtating of this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion; for if the childe at firſt be not well ſwadled, it proveth crooked in it's growth; we muſt therefore lay a ſure and clear foundation, that our ſuperſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture may endure. And</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> Firſt, <hi>The Queſtion is not of the poſſibility of a believers total and final periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>; If we conſider him in himſelf, if we behold him in his own power not as elected and covenanted with in Chriſt, then it's not only poſſible, but even ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, that he ſhould eternally periſh: This is evidenced in the apoſtate An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and <hi>Adam,</hi> there grace was amiſſible, yea they did actually loſe it, when yet they had not a corrupt nature within to betray them, as we have. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they did not neceſſarily, but by a voluntary choice fall into their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction: How much more would this terrible apoſtaſie be in godly men,
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:65216:195"/>
though ſanctified, ſeeing there are the powerfull reliques of corruption abiding in them, and withall many violent temptations without to overwhelm them, if left to themſelves. When therefore we ſay, the true believer cannot periſh, it's not to be attributed to his ſtrength and power, but ſolely to the grace of God, which as at firſt wrought converſion; ſo it doth alſo perſeverance and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance in that eſtate; for as the removal of the pillars doth immediately make the houſe to fall, being it's naturall motion is to deſcend downwards; ſo the withdrawing of Gods gracious power would immediately cauſe the moſt holy man to fall into his old rubbiſh and filthy vomit of ſin; it's not therefore onely poſſible, but certain and inevitable, that every converted man, would be apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate from God; did not a mighty grace daily preſerve him; and this is fully evidenced by that prayer; all are taught to pray, though never ſo holy, that <hi>God would not lead us into temptation,</hi> doth not that plainly teach us, That we are ſo weak and infirme, that there is no temptation, if left to our ſelves, but it would wholly overcome us: Oh then, Let the moſt eminent and chiefeſt belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers daily pray, that God would not leave them to their own ſtrength and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation, for this is to be left in hels mouth.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> Secondly, As it's poſſible thus for believers to ſuffer ſhipwrack and loſe all, if left to themſelves, did not God keep them: <hi>So God for holy and wiſe ends, hath in ſome meaſure and degree left them, whereby they have fallen foully and dreadfully.</hi> So that we may ſay, they were like <hi>Sampſon,</hi> they loſt their ſtrength; the Philiſtims roſe upon them, onely in time their ſtrength came again. As a man in an Apoplexy or Lethargy, hath an inward principle of life, but there are no outward demonſtrations of it.</p>
            <p>Now this apoſtaſie and decay may be in ſeveral particulars:</p>
            <p n="1">1. In reſpect of the acts and exerciſe of grace. Theſe are interrupted, the ſtreams do not runne. They ſeem to be a barren wilderneſſe, rivers of living water do not flow out of their belly; God findes as in that Church, <hi>Revel.</hi> 2. Their works are not filled up or perfect: Hence God promiſeth, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.17. not only to give the habitual principles of grace, but the actual exerciſe of them, when the juſt is ſaid to live by his faith, that denoteth a continued acting, yet ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times theſe actings of faith and other graces are intermitted. The pulſe beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſlowly, if at all.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Not only the actings of faith are interrupted, but the contrary actings of ſinne are put forth, in ſtead of faith they break out into unbelief; in ſtead of fervency and heavenly-mindedneſs they are dull and earthly; ſo that now, not the houſe of <hi>David,</hi> but of <hi>Saul</hi> doth overcome; Now grace is dormant, and ſinne is awakened and lively; yea they commit foul and enormous ſinnes, ſuch as the light of nature would palpably condemn, as we ſee it in <hi>David,</hi> with what contrivances and deviſes did he accompliſh his adultery and murder, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding one grievous ſinne to another, and no doubt would have gone further, had not the Lord ſtopt him in his way: Not that theſe groſſe vices did totally drive away the Spirit of God, and eradicate all the principles and ſeed of grace within, for then how could <hi>David</hi> immediately upon <hi>Nathan</hi>'s reproof, have ſo melted and ingenuouſly confeſſed his ſinne, but for the while, the root only of grace was under the ground, there appeared no fruit; or as a man that is mad hath a principle of reaſon, though for the preſent, the uſe of it is vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently hindered: or as <hi>Eutiches,</hi> who fell from the window (<hi>Acts</hi> 20.) and all thought he had been dead; but <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>There was life in him.</hi> Thus it was with <hi>David,</hi> there was a ſecret principle of grace, but that was overwhelmed and ſtopt up by many luſts, as when foggy miſts do ariſe and obnulliate the Sun. It's true, <hi>David</hi> at that time knew thoſe actions to be ſinne, and ſo he could not but ſinne againſt his conſcience; but it was a general conſcience, it was not it may be, practical and convincing, <hi>quoad hic &amp; nunc</hi>; ſo that he did not ſinne

maliciouſly, though he was ſeduced by ſtrong luſts: Whether it was a ſinne of infirmity, is diſcuſſed by ſome: But we cannot ſay, <hi>David</hi>'s ſinnes at that time were of ignorance or infirmity, nor yet properly of malice, but of a mixt kind: It was not of meer malice prevailing, from a total want of a principle of good, but from the not working of that good principle; They were not ſins of ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry infirmity (ſaith D. <hi>Ames</hi>) but of extraordinary.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> Thirdly, <hi>Not only the acts, but the habits alſo of grace may in reſpect of their degrees be much abated and grown languid.</hi> This indeed ſome have doubted of, Whether a godly man can, or doth fall from any degree of his grace; and they have held the negative, That a degree of grace is of the ſame nature with the eſſence of grace, and both indefectible. But when ſinne in the acts of it, hath prevailed on the godly, as many examples declare, no doubt but the principle of grace is thereby debilitated; If darkneſſe be introduced, the light cannot be ſo prevalent; If ſickneſſe increaſe, health muſt impair: Now ſinne doth expell grace, both meritoriouſly and efficiently, in a well-explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſenſe.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/> Fourthly, That we may not be too large in this, <hi>None can poſitively dogma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize, how farre, and in what ſinnes a godly man may fall, and how long he may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ere his recovery.</hi> As it's difficult to give in a Catalogue of the Fundament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Articles of Religion, without the faith whereof a man muſt neceſſarily pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh; ſo it is to lay down, what ſinnes, and how perpetrated do immediately expell grace from the ſoul. Indeed we may ſpeak to the negative, what ſhall not be done; but to the poſitive, How farre, that is difficult to ſay, we may ſay, they cannot commit the ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt, or the ſinne unto death, that they cannot die in final impenitency or obſtinacy; but to go further, and to ſet down the very peg, as it were, hitherto they can fall, and no further, to give the <hi>minimum quod non,</hi> and the <hi>ultimum juſtum non eſſe,</hi> is harder in grace, then in nature. The godly therefore are to hear theſe things with trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, and with all diligence to attend to ſuch means, as are appointed for their preſervation to eternal life; God may leave them in a dreadfull, miſerable condition; ſo that they may for the preſent ſeem to be ſo many <hi>Cains</hi> and <hi>Judaſſes.</hi>

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/> Fifthly, Obſerve, That as without Gods ſpecial cuſtody, <hi>we would certainly be undone; So the godly when ſinning do deſerve Gods eternal forſaking of them.</hi> The ground of their indiſſoluble union with God, is not any good in them, but Gods meer grace: They do often and often deſerve, that God ſhould with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw all favour from them, as he did from the apoſtate Angels; ſo that it's a <hi>calumny</hi> of thoſe who oppoſe the Saints perſeverance, that we teach, the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man, though he give way to all licentiouſneſſe and impiety, yet may be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured that God will never leave him, and he ſhall be ſaved; for though we are to ſay more to this, yet for the preſent we affirm, That a godly man is ſo far from having any ſuch abſolute certainty in a way of ſinne, that he is to conclude the contrary; if he do thus and thus rebell againſt God, and not cleave to him. God will at laſt wholly forſake him.</p>
            <p>Now theſe things do eſpecially provoke God to leave his people, though not totally, yet gradually, and that both in reſpect of grace and conſolations.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>When they reſiſt the light of God ſhining upon them.</hi> There is a natural light, and a ſupernatural: now to oppoſe this, to walk againſt this, is to provoke God to forſake us, for thus ſuch who enjoy the means of grace, and have wonderfull workings upon their ſoul, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. come to be left by detaining the truth in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs. Therefore the Jews were delivered up to <hi>blindneſs and hardneſs of heart, becauſe ſeeing they would not ſee, and hearing they would not hear</hi>; and thus by proportion it is in a ſanctified perſon.</p>

we may inſtance, why <hi>Peter</hi> and not <hi>Iudas,</hi> who though he had not Sanctifying Grace yet had many good Gifts of Gods Spirit, and none can give a dfference of this but by running to Gods grace confirming one and not the other, So then as we ſee it was with the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the Wilderneſſe, travelling to <hi>Canaan,</hi> their ſhoes and garments did not wax old, or their bread moldy, God miraculouſly preſerving of it; Thus in our way to Heaven God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth the Godly ſo that their Graces which otherwiſe would quickly periſh and decay, are yet kept lively and vigorous by him; As in Phyſick there are Medicines to recover out of Diſeaſes, and then to preſerve and keep health; So there is the grace of God, out of ſinne, and Grace to preſerve us being thus recovered; Hence <hi>Auſtin</hi> well obſerveth that expreſſion, <hi>Rom</hi> 11. <hi>I have left to my ſelf ſeven thouſand that have not bowed their knees to</hi> Baal; It was God that had ſaved them from Idolatry, he kept them from the common corrupt worſhip, not they themſelves, and <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. the Apoſtle ſpeaking of a weak Chriſtian ſaith, he <hi>ſhall be holden up,</hi> for God is able to make him ſtand, God is able not he himſelf; This Truth that profound Doctor <hi>Bradwardine</hi> doth ſolidly maintain againſt <hi>Pelagians, lib.</hi> 2. <hi>De Cauſâ Dei,</hi> cap. 8, 9, 10. where he reproveth <hi>Lumbard</hi> the Maſter of Sentences for attributing perſeverance to a mans Free-will, deſiring his Zeal may be excuſed, becauſe it is for Gods Truth; In that Diſcourſe he well ſheweth how that when God hath infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Grace into a mans heart, it is not as when the Husbandman hath prepared and fitted the ground, and hath caſt his Seed into it, then he leaveth it that of its one ſelf it may fructifie and bring forth Corn; But as the Air when it is enlightened by the Sun-beams needeth the continuall preſence of them, ſo that if but for an hour light be withdrawn it is preſently dark; Thus if God ſhould from the moſt holy men withdraw his gracious help but for a moment, they would be immediatly plunged into all evil, for if the Heavens that are ſo glorious Creatures, and for their firm ſetling called the Firmament, doe yet wholly ſtand by the Omnipotent power and Word of God, how much rather muſt the eminent and dear Children of God be preſerved in their ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall Life by the ſame Grace and divine might; Hence 1 <hi>Chron. ult. David</hi> praieth, that what good there was for the preſent in the peoples hearts, God would alwaies keep it in them; Thus perſeverance then is not the fruit of our own ſtrength, nor is it beſtowed for any antecedent merits of our own, but meerly from the grace and favour of God, but of this more, <hi>v.</hi> 15.</p>

<pb n="354" facs="tcp:65216:197"/>
it appeareth that the godly ought to have better things then thoſe mentioned; Do not therefore gather the Apoſtaſie of thoſe that are truly godly, becauſe ſometimes you ſee men of eminent parts and profeſſions in Religion become degenerate and unſound, for poſſibly theſe never had the Truth of grace, and ſuch alſo were thoſe named by <hi>Peter,</hi> 2 Pet. 2.20. where ſome are ſaid <hi>to have eſcaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of Chriſt, and yet were again entangled in their former luſts</hi>; We grant, that the Faith of Chriſt had ſo farre a powerfull operation upon them, that they left off thoſe pollutions they lived in whilſt Heathens, but yet that they were never changed at the very root and heart, appearrth in that the Apoſtle cals them but <hi>waſhed Swine,</hi> they had not changed their Swiniſh nature, they were not made <hi>Sheep,</hi> though they had an outward Reformation: Now that all ſuch though never ſo won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull for parts and duties, if falling off, never were truly principled with the work of grace in their ſouls, appeareth by that eminent place, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.19. <hi>They went from us becauſe they were not of us, If they had been of us they would have continued with us</hi>; Here it is plain, that whoſoever is truly of the Church of God he will alwaies abide ſo; Indeed when we ſee the fall of ſuch who ſeemed ſuch glorious Starres, and ſuch tall Cedars, we ought in an holy man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to fear and tremble; We that ſtand are to take heed leſt we fall, but this doth not prove the total Apoſtaſie of thoſe that do truely belong to God, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. He that did <hi>beleeve and receive the Word with joy,</hi> did yet at laſt <hi>wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> becauſe <hi>he had not a good and honeſt heart</hi>; Now when we ſay, all theſe mentioned had not true Grace, we do not mean they were groſſe Hypocrites, as if they did outwardly profeſſe they beleeved, but inwardly were the clean contrary; No, only we take an hypocrite in a large ſence for one who hath ſome imperfect and inchoate works of Gods Spirit upon him, which are like diſpoſitions in a tendency unto true Grace, as the <hi>Embryo</hi> to a Childe, but yet they fall farre ſhort of Sanctification; They in their thoughts and hearts are reall and ſerious, others apprehend them to be in the ſtate of Grace, but ſtill though Virgins they are but Fooliſh Virgins, They have not that Oyle which will ſerve when the Bridegroom cometh; Terrible it is to hear this, and oh what ſharp goads ſhould they be in our ſides, leſt we never as yet have gone further then ſuch perſons, Say it again unto thy ſelf, Am I not gone further then ſuch and ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons?</p>

Why are they commanded to fear, and to take heed leſt they fall; Do not all theſe Admonitions ſeem vain and abſurd? As if we ſhould bid a man take heed he do not fly up into the air, if he do, he will fall; Now if there be any abſurdity in this, will not all this hold as well in thoſe A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles whom they grant to be infallibly preſerved to Eternal Life; Though Chriſt told them <hi>Their Names were written in heaven.

The falſe Apoſtles are there ſaid to <hi>ſeduce if it were poſſible the very Elect, If it were poſſible,</hi> therefore the Elect can never be ſeduced into a periſhing eſtate, if it be ſaid, that <hi>Elect</hi> is to be taken adje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively for as much as good and precious, as the Septuagint ſometimes uſeth the word, in which all <hi>Iſrael</hi> is ſometimes called Gods Elect, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.4. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65.9. This cannot ſtand, for in the ſame Chapter, <hi>v.</hi> 20.

How eaſily did one ſinne draw on another? So that it would have been abſurd to have ſaid that <hi>Bath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheba</hi> (who was meerly paſſive at firſt) did ſo ſtrongly tempt <hi>David,</hi> that if it were poſſible he would have fallen into Adultery: And if further you ſay, The godly may fall into fundamentall errours though Elected; Even the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples did not beleeve Chriſts Reſurrection and his ſpiritual Office as a Meſſiah, We anſwer, they may a while, but God will graciouſly recover them; Theſe Vipers ſhall not ſtick upon them till they die; Though they have ſwallowed theſe deadly things yet they ſhall at laſt vomit them up; As God though he ſuffered Chriſts body to be dead and buried in the grave, yet he would not let it ſee corruption; Thus it is here, Though the Godly may erre dangerouſly, and fall fouly, yet they ſhall not ſee corruption: Laſtly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It is anſwered, that the Elect before their converſion may lie in all ſinne, and be deceived by all kinde of errours, Therefore there cannot be any ſtrength from this becauſe Elected; But the Reply is eaſie; By <hi>elect</hi> are meant ſuch who do not only partake of that mercy, but ſuch who finde the effects of this upon their ſoul, Elected and converted; And that this is included is plain, becauſe it is ſaid, <hi>If it be poſſible to deceive even the Elect</hi>: Now he is ſaid to be deceived that was in the right and Truth, it's improper to ſay, They ſhall deceive ſuch as are already in a plain deceived way, So that this neceſſarily inferreth, That it is meant of Elected perſons who finde the mighty power of this upon their hearts.</p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Argum. </seg>3</label> 3. A Third Argument ſhall be From the <hi>Mediatour of this Covenant, or the way to ratifie and confirm theſe Gracious Promiſes,</hi> which are from the firſt to the laſt, that we ſhall have Everlaſting Glory from Predeſtination to Glorification, and that is <hi>by Chriſts bloud,</hi> So that Chriſt is become their Mediatour, their Head, and they his Members; The Covenant is confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>Death of Chriſt,</hi> and the <hi>Sacraments</hi> are viſible Seals to confirme this, 2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 2.20. <hi>All the Promiſes of God are in Chriſt Yea and Amen:</hi> There is not Yea and Nay, but a ſure infallibility in them; Hence this Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of Chriſt and our Bleſſing in him, as <hi>Abrahams</hi> Seed is ſaid to have a Promiſe, <hi>and an Oath to confirm it.</hi> Hebr. 6.18. <hi>That by two Immutable things, in which it was impoſſible for God to lye, we might have ſtrong Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> Chriſt then by his Bloud purchaſed theſe Priviledges for us, he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by his Death our Salvation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and his Prieſthood for this purpoſe was confirmed by an Oath; How then can we ever think or imagine that they ſhould periſh who have ſuch preſervation and Security provided for them: Indeed we ſee the Angels, and <hi>Adam</hi> though full of Grace to Apoſtatize, and the Godly man though weak in Grace, and ſurrounded with many Temptations, yet ſafely preſerved, but the Reaſon is plain, They have a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour of this New Covenant, who by his Death will certainly bring them to Glory, for if this were not ſo, but all depended upon mans indifferent power; Chriſt might have died, and not one man have been ſaved, who cannot but deteſt and abhorre ſuch a thought, that by the <hi>Arminian</hi> Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition Chriſt might have ſuffered and endured all thoſe Agonies, and not one be ſaved, all might have been in vain, but the Scripture ſpeaks other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 53.11. <hi>The work of the Lord ſhall proſper in his Hand; He ſhall ſee his Seed and the Travell of his Soul, and ſhall be ſatisfied</hi>: Chriſt would not have been ſatisfied in his Soul, had he not ſeen the Fruit and Event of his Agonies and Sufferings, and that ſuch perſons were ſaved for whom he died.</p>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Argum. </seg>4</label> 4. A Fourth Argument is taken <hi>From Chriſts peculiar Praier and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion for their Preſervation</hi>; And thus the Argument runnes: <hi>Thoſe for whom Chriſt offered up a Mediatory Praier, and earneſtly begged and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated that they might be ſo kept that none ſhould periſh, Such must infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be preſerved, but all the Godly are comprehended in this Prayer for their Preſervation</hi>; You ſee in theſe Verſes it is Chriſts whole drift and ſcope to obtain this for them, that though they muſt be in the world, yet that they might be kept from the evil and wickedneſſe of the world, and leſt this ſhould be thought for his Apoſtles onely, or ſuch as did already be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve in him, He addeth, <hi>verſe</hi> 20. that he praieth for all ſuch as <hi>ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:65216:200"/>
in him</hi>: Here you ſee all that do or ſhall beleeve in Chriſt they are comprehended in this Praier, that none may periſh; Now it's plain that the Father heard Chriſt in all that he deſired, and there was alwaies an Agreement or Correſpondency between his will and the Fathers; Now what Chriſt did for all, we ſee more pregnantly in <hi>Peter,</hi> Luke 22.23. <hi>I have praied</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that thy Faith fail not</hi>; This is done for every god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Perſon as well as <hi>Peter,</hi> and therefore upon this Occaſion ſaid in the generall to all the Apoſtles; <hi>Satan had deſired to winnow them,</hi> if it were poſſible to have caſt them out as Chaff; And this Mediatory Prayer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth ſtill in ſome ſence, For <hi>Hebr.</hi> 5.26. <hi>He ever-liveth to make Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion for us</hi>; This certainly muſt neceſſarily be effectual to our preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Argum. </seg>5</label> 5. A Fifth Argument is, <hi>The Godly mans divine protection to Everlaſting Happineſſe is confirmed by aſſertory places as well as promiſſory</hi>; There are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Texts of Scripture that doe plainly and clearly declare as much: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let that be beleeved before mens Opinions, <hi>John</hi> 6.39. <hi>It is the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Will that of thoſe who are given me I ſhould loſe none of them</hi>; To this purpoſe alſo is that in <hi>John</hi> 10.28. Yea, that we may firmly be eſtabliſhed herein, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.18. Our Saviour tels us, <hi>That he will build his Church upon a Rock, that the Gates of Hell ſhall never prevail againſt it</hi>; Some would limit the Gates of Hell to Death, as it were an Hebraiſme, but it is plain our Saviour meaneth every thing that ſhall oppoſe and hinder him in the Building of his Church, and thus not onely Death, but Sinne and Hell are great Adverſaries, otherwiſe it might ſo fall out that God ſhould have no Church here upon the Earth, which would be a horrible Derogation to Chriſt, as if he might be a Head without Members: Another pregnant place affirming this is in 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.19. <hi>If they had been of us they would no doubt have continued with us</hi>; No doubt: See how the Apoſtle puts it out of all Queſtion; There is a Diſciple indeed, and a Diſciple in Appearance and Profeſſion onely: The Diſciple indeed is a Pillar that ſhall never be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved out of the Houſe, but ſhall abide for ever; But the Diſciple in Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance and Shew onely, he is not a fixed Starre but a Meteor, For all his light and blaze is compounded of terreſtriall matter, and ſo will quickly pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh and vaniſh away: We may ſay, Duſt he is, and unto Duſt he will return: Of ſuch our Saviour ſpeaketh, <hi>John</hi> 10. <hi>Every Branch in me that bringeth not forth Fruit, he cutteth off, and casteth away</hi>: It is a Branch in him not by lively Inſition but externall Profeſſion: Another place to bring up the Rear of theſe Aſſertory Texts of Scripture, is 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.9. <hi>Whoſoever is born of God</hi> (there is the Univerſality) <hi>he ſinneth not, neither can he,</hi> viz. not as a <hi>Cain,</hi> as a wicked one he doth not ſinne, he cannot give up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf wholly unto ſinne, and the Reaſon is becauſe <hi>the Seed of God abideth in him.</hi>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Argum. </seg>6</label> 6. A ſixth Argument is, <hi>The Compariſons and Similitudes the Scripture u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth doe inferre the Godly mans Continuance</hi>; And although Similitudes doe not prove in every particular, yet they doe for that end they are brought; Now the Scripture excellently illuſtrates the ſtability of the Godly by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during things, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1. To a <hi>Tree</hi> planted by the Waters Side: Alſo to Mount <hi>Zion</hi> that can never be removed, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 125.1. Eſpecially <hi>John</hi> 4.14. where Regenerating Grace is called a <hi>Well of water ſpringing up to Eternall Life,</hi> and is differenced from materiall water in this reſpect, A man drinketh of that and is thirſty again, but whoſoever drinketh of this ſhall never thirſt again: He ſhall not goe back into <hi>Egypt</hi> again, deſiring his former Onyons and Garlick.</p>

humbly do prove their ſtanding; Indeed the <hi>Arminian</hi> inferreth the clean contrary, but the Truth is, By theſe Admonitions, Exhortations, and other means of Grace they are enabled to continue: As man by his Food is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved alive, for God uſeth all theſe Ordinances as practicall <hi>Mediums</hi> by which he ſtirreth them up when ſecure, quickens them when decaying, and recovers them when fallen; To theſe we may adde the Afflictions which the Godly are ſure to have when they goe aſtray; Therefore whereas <hi>Solomon</hi> is thought by all to be the hardeſt Inſtance of any that had true Grace, and apoſtatized ſo fouly, yet that he died not out of Grace, appeareth not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the Book of <hi>Eccleſiaſtes,</hi> which he made at his latter end, as a plain Teſtimony of his Repentance and Turning to God, but alſo fully by 2 <hi>Sam</hi> 1.14. <hi>If he commit Iniquity, I will chaſten him, but my Mercy I will not utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly take away,</hi> So that theſe Afflictions being ſanctified will be effectuall to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken them, and bring them home with the Prodigall at laſt to their Fathers Houſe.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, If God did not vouchſafe Perſeverance in Grace as well as Grace, he had not done the beſt for us; To keep Grace is far better then to have Grace: It's perſeverance that crowneth all, Holding out to the end, is that which bleſſeth all: Therefore the Scripture deſcribeth God by this, <hi>That he is able to keep them unſpotted and blameleſſe till the Coming of Chriſt,</hi> It would redound to Gods diſhonour, as it did to that fooliſh Builder, if God ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin and not finiſh his work.</p>

            <p>THe next thing to be treated of, is the implyed Anſwer to an Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that might eaſily be made, <hi>If Chriſt had ſo faithfully kept them all, How comes</hi> Judas <hi>to periſh?</hi> Now our Saviour anſwereth this two wayes:</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>He was a ſonne of Perdition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>There was a prediction of this in Scripture,</hi> and that muſt be full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled.</p>
            <p>Again, This may not be brought onely to anſwer an Objection, but by way of Conſolation to the Apoſtles, and Confirmation of them, who could not but be much ſcandalized upon <hi>Judas</hi> his hainous betraying of Chriſt: Therefore this is ſpoken to forewarn them, that they may not be offended, when it cometh to paſſe.</p>
            <p>The opening of the words doth deſerve much diligence, becauſe at the firſt view, they ſeem to carry, as if one of thoſe who are elected may periſh, and that <hi>Judas</hi> is one excepted from among the choſen ones, and this place is much urged by thoſe that deny any abſolute election: Therefore to inform your judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, let us take notice of theſe three things:</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Why</hi> Judas <hi>is called a ſon of perdition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Why he is ſaid to be already periſhed,</hi> when as yet he had not deſtroyed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, nor was in hell.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Whether that phraſe <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> be exceptive or adverſative.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Why <hi>Judas</hi> is called the ſon of perdition.</note>For the firſt, <hi>Why</hi> Judas <hi>is called a ſonne of perdition,</hi> this is an Hebraiſm; for among many other uſages of the word, <hi>Ben,</hi> or <hi>Bath,</hi> they particularly uſe it in two caſes; firſt, when they would expreſſe one that is given, or much verſed in ſuch a way, they call him the ſonne of that. Thus <hi>Deut.</hi> 3, 8. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.7. <hi>The ſonnes of ſtrength,</hi> are ſtrong men, <hi>The ſonnes of Belial,</hi> Deut. 13.13, are ſuch as wickedly bent themſelves to break the Law of God; and thus we have
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:65216:201"/>
               <hi>the children of light,</hi> and the <hi>children of wiſdom,</hi> the <hi>children of the Kingdom,</hi> Mat. 8.12.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When the Genitive caſe ſignifieth a <hi>puniſhment</hi> or <hi>reward</hi>; thus it uſeth the word <hi>ſonne,</hi> and ſignifieth ſome deſert or fitneſs for that thing. Thus 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 20.31. <hi>a ſonne of death,</hi> is one that deſerveth to die, <hi>Deut.</hi> 25.2. a <hi>ſon of percuſſions,</hi> is one that deſerveth to be ſcourged, and <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.3. <hi>Children of wrath,</hi> are ſuch as deſerve it; and thus it is here, <hi>Judas</hi> is called a <hi>ſonne of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi> both becauſe he did wilfully give himſelf up to ſuch ſinnes, as did deſtroy him, and becauſe he did deſerve it, by his perfidiouſneſſe. Some indeed take the word <hi>perdition</hi> actively, as if he were called <hi>the ſonne of perdition,</hi> becauſe he did ſeek to deſtroy Chriſt, as the Devil is called <hi>Apollyon,</hi> becauſe of his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to damn men; but that ſeemeth not ſo proper. Three things therefore are implied in this phraſe, <hi>a ſon of perdition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>The Event and end,</hi> which will certainly befall him, he ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>His ſinne or guilt,</hi> whereby he deſerveth ſuch perdition: Even as Antichriſt, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.3. is called, <hi>the ſonne of perdition,</hi> and <hi>the man of ſinne,</hi> the ſonne of perdition, there is the end, a man of ſinne, there is the cauſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is a man of ſinne, he muſt be a ſonne of perdition, and thus it is with <hi>Judas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, There is a further thing in this, and that is <hi>Gods appointing</hi> and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining of <hi>Judas</hi> to this deſtruction, not that the cauſe or blame is to be laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this predeſtination, but upon <hi>Judas</hi> only; God ordained him for his ſinnes to this perdition: Even as <hi>Jude v.</hi> 4. it is ſaid of ſome, <hi>That they were of old ordained to judgement.</hi> The like is 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.8. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.17.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Queſtion is, <hi>Why is</hi> Judas <hi>ſaid to be already periſhed,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Why <hi>Judas</hi> is ſaid to be already peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed.</note> 
               <hi>ſeeing he had not yet hung himſelf, nor were his bowels guſhed out, and he gone to his proper place?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Anſwer is, 1. Becauſe the initials of condemnation were already begun in him, according to that <hi>John</hi> 3. <hi>He that believeth not is already judged.</hi> And then</p>
            <p n="2">2. Becauſe this was but immediately before his perdition: even as Chriſt ſaid, <hi>I am not of the world,</hi> becauſe he was immediately to leave it.</p>

               </gap>, <hi>But the ſon of perdition?</hi> Some ſay, that it's an exceptive particle, and therefore anſwer, That our Saviour ſpeaks thus of <hi>Judas,</hi> as if he were an elect perſon, becauſe in all mens judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments he did appear to be ſo as yet. Thus <hi>Zanchy</hi> and <hi>Calvin,</hi> Our Saviour indeed ſpeaketh (ſaith he) improperly, as to the Grammar, but conſonantly enough to the ordinary cuſtom of men, who ſpeak of a thing appearing to be ſo, as if it were ſo.</p>
            <p>Others, they underſtand this giving, <hi>Of which none is periſhed, but Judas,</hi> not of giving by Election, but to the Apoſtleſhip, and by way of Office, in which ſenſe our Saviour ſaid, <hi>Have I not choſen twelve, and one of you is a devil?</hi> He doth not there ſpeak of an eternal Election, but a temporal one to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolical Office; But becauſe all along in this Chapter, Thoſe that are given to Chriſt are ſaid to have eternal life, and to be given out of the world, we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it of eternal Election, in which ſenſe it's plainly ſaid, <hi>Judas</hi> was now elected, <hi>John</hi> 13.18. <hi>I ſpeak not of you all (viz.</hi> that you ſhall be happy) <hi>I know whom I have choſen.</hi> Therefore the anſwer is, that <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> is not by way of exception, but oppoſition, not as if <hi>Judas</hi> were one excepted of thoſe given to Chriſt, and periſhed, but the contrary, <hi>None is periſhed,</hi> but he who was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver given, and therefore is a <hi>Sonne of perdition.</hi> Thus the words are uſed <hi>Mat.</hi> 24 36. <hi>Of that day knoweth no man, no nor the Angels of Heaven, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, but only thoſe men, which have not the Seal of God on their <hi>foreheads</hi>; and that it muſt be ſo underſtood here is plain, becauſe <hi>John</hi> 6.36. it's expreſly ſaid, <hi>None that are given to him ſhall ever periſh.</hi> Thus Latine Criticks obſerve, that the word <hi>niſi,</hi> uſed in this place by the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, is ſometimes in <hi>Tully</hi> and <hi>Terence,</hi> with other good Authours for <hi>ſed.</hi> The words thus explained, Obſerve</p>

               <hi>That there are ſome perſons that are wilfully ſet to deſtroy and damn themſelves, though they have never ſo many excellent remedies and means to the contrary.</hi> Thus <hi>Judas,</hi> though called to be an Apoſtle, though endowed with gifts to work mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, though in the conſtant Communion with Chriſt, ſeeing his holy life, and hearing his heavenly Doctrine, yet is not moved by all this, but wilfully and obſtinately goeth on in wayes of ſelf-perdition; yea though our Saviour had immediately before waſhed all their feet, <hi>Judas</hi> his feet as well as the reſt, which was a ſtrong engagement to make him full of love to Chriſt; and though he was admoniſhed of it, that he ſhould <hi>betray him,</hi> though he heard our Saviour ſay, <hi>It had been better for him he had never been born,</hi> yet from theſe admonitions, he goeth immediately, and conſummates all iniquity. From this man called here, <hi>a ſonne of perdition,</hi> yet formerly as eminent as the other Apoſtles, many wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy particulars are to be gathered, but for the preſent I ſhall pitch on this,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That there are ſome men ſo reſolvedly and obſtinately given to damn themſelves, that let what will come in the way, they will go on.</hi> Even as <hi>Balaam</hi> in his purpoſe to curſe the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſets forward with great reſolutions, driveth on his Aſs, though that ſpeak to him (which might have been a terrible aſtoniſhment) yet for all that he purſueth his wicked deſign, till God ſtop him whether he will or no: Or as <hi>Saul</hi> was wretchedly bent to murder himſelf, and therefore cals upon his Armour bearer to run him thorow, which when he refuſed, he deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately fals upon his own ſpear, and kils himſelf. Thus there are thouſands of perſons, that do with as much obſtinacy, and deſperate hardneſs of heart, throw themſelves into hell; God commands a man, <hi>To do no murder,</hi> and ſelf-murder is rare, becauſe the care of life, and fear of death is implanted in men, but ſelf-deſtruction and ſelf-damnation is very common; for men neither have a love to their immortal ſouls, nor yet a fear of eternal damnation. No wonder, if ſome perſons are thus, when we reade of an whole body of people or Nation ready to do this, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.37. Chriſt doth there in a melting manner weep over <hi>Jeruſalem, O Jeruſalem, Jeruſalem, thou that killeſt the Prophets?</hi> &amp;c. <hi>How often would I have gathered thee, and thou wouldſt not?</hi> This compaſſionate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailing of them, was enough to turn ſtones into tears, <hi>but they would not.</hi> It is not ſaid, they underſtood not, they deſired, but other things hindred them: No, <hi>They would not</hi>; There was a pertinacious wilfull obſtinacy; There are more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies and means ſufficient to have humbled them in ſackcloth and aſhes, but <hi>they would not.</hi> This curſed diſpoſition was of old in them, <hi>Jer.</hi> 18.12. when the Prophet had informed them of Gods purpoſe to bring evil upon them, and that <hi>therefore they ſhould return from their evil way:</hi> See what an obſtinate reply they make, <hi>There is no hope,</hi> or as ſome render it, it's a deſperate caſe, <hi>We will go every one in his evil wayes, and after the imagination of our own hearts:</hi> So truly did the Prophet ſay, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 13.9. <hi>O Iſrael, thou haſt deſtroyed thy ſelf.</hi> That as it is from a mans own body diſeaſes grow, which afterwards kill him; and moths are bred in that linnen, which afterwards conſume it. Thus from a mans one ſelf come thoſe ſinnes, which tend to his everlaſting damnation. They will
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:65216:202"/>
deſtroy themſelves, who can ſtop them or perſwade them to the contrary.</p>
            <p>To purſue this, becauſe it's the caſe of many men,<note place="margin">The cauſes that move men to damn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</note> who live under the means of grace: Let us conſider, What are the cauſes that move men thus violently to damn themſelves, as if they could not do it ſoon enough? And</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>There are many, though glorying in the title of Chriſtians, that are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanely Atheiſtical.</hi> They do not believe there is a God, or Heaven, or Hell;<note place="margin">1. Atheiſm.</note> they do not firmly aſſent to Gods Word as true. Now what good can all the preaching in the world do, though the Miniſters were as ſo many Angels, and their voice as terrible as the ſound of the trumpet at the laſt day; if men be Athei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical, they will not believe what any Miniſter preacheth. They bleſs themſelves in their wicked wayes, and will not hearken to any thing. <hi>Achitophel</hi> did not more reſolutely go hang himſelf, then thoſe to damn themſelves; For as faith is the great inſtrument, whereby the Word preached becomes effectual to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; ſo unbelief is the great ſtop and <hi>obex</hi> in the way. This is the door and barre to keep all off, which made the Prophet complain, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.1. and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle afterwards alleadgeth it, as the cauſe of mens deſtruction, <hi>Who hath believed our report?</hi> Hence <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.2. <hi>The Word did not profit the Iſraelites, becauſe not mixed with faith,</hi> A Metaphor from the Phyſicians potion, which doth no good, becauſe not mixed with ſuch ingredients; This is to be worſe then the devils, <hi>who believe and tremble,</hi> but thou doſt neither; As long therefore as men abide in unbelief, no Miniſtry, no preaching will do them any good, faith is the foundation, without this there cannot be any building. But though the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are not made good, unleſs we believe; yet know to thy terrour that all the curſes and threatnings in Gods Word will be fulfilled upon thee, whether thou believe or not.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Another cauſe is, <hi>Groſs, bruitiſh and ſtupid Ignorance</hi>;<note place="margin">2. Ignorance.</note> When people have no knowledge or underſtanding in matters of Religion, they fall as eaſily as blinde men, that know not where they go, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.18. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeaking of ſome, <hi>who gave themſelves up to wickedneſs, and were paſt feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> They had no remorſe or ſenſe of conſcience; as a dead hand, though it be runne through with the ſword, yet feels no pain, he makes the cauſe of this ſenſleſneſs, to be the darkneſs in their underſtanding, and the blindneſs which was upon their hearts. Thus <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4.1, 2. when the Prophet complained, That the Land was overthrown with ſwearing, lying and murders, he makes this the cauſe, <hi>There is no knowledge of God in the Land</hi>; and <hi>Jude v.</hi> 10. relateth ſome, <hi>Who ſpeak evil of thoſe things they know not, and what they know naturally, they did as bruit beaſts corrupt themſelves with.</hi> Is not this the character of many in theſe dayes? Their helliſh mouths are opened to rail and deride, and ſo ſpeak mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious words againſt thoſe that are godly, when they are ſottiſh and ignorant in religious things, having no knowledge, but what is natural, and with that, they are like bruit beaſts, corrupting themſelves. The ſottiſh ignorance and bruitiſh blindneſs upon many, makes them to venture deſperately; Oh if their eyes were open! Did they but ſee what the godly ſee, they would not dare to ſtep a ſtep forward in that way which leadeth to death. But as mad men feel no pain, though inſtruments be thruſt into them, ſo neither do they. Men out of their wits venture upon ſelf-murdering practiſes; and thus do thoſe that are void of all ſpiritual underſtanding. Hence Admonition is called in the Scripture <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.13. <hi>Paul</hi> commands them <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>to warn them that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly,</hi> or to put a minde and wits into them, as if they were mad, and would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy themſelves not knowing what they did.</p>
            <p>A third cauſe of ſuch wilfull reſolvedneſs to damn themſelves, is, <hi>hardneſſe of heart.</hi> As long as the heart is ſoft and tender, it trembleth at Gods word,<note place="margin">3. Hardneſs of heart.</note> and is afraid of ſinne, but when it is turned into a ſtone, and made like an adamant, then it's ſenſible of nothing. <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> though he had ſuch wonderfull miracles
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:65216:203"/>
wrought before him, that never ſuch things were heard of in the world before, yet becauſe his heart was hardened, therefore doth he ſinne preſumptuouſly to his own ruine: And thus it was with the Jews, when that ſpirituall judgement ſpoken of (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 6.) was accompliſhed in them, <hi>to have blinde eyes and hard hearts.</hi> Thus all the Prophets at firſt, and all the Apoſtles afterwards, yea Chriſt himſelf with all his miracles did not mollifie them, yea by theſe remedies, as all incurable diſeaſes do, they grew worſe and worſe; what motions, relentings muſt we expect from ſtones? <hi>Lapidi loqueris,</hi> is a proverb; Truly ſuch is all preaching, and the whole Miniſtry to men given up to a hard heart. Though the Prophet when he ſpake to the Altar of ſtones, crying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>O Altar, Altar,</hi> that immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly rent, yet the hearts of men are more ſenſleſs. Pray therefore of all judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments not to fall into an hard heart. Though thou mayeſt fall into hard times, into hard dealings from others, into many hard diſtreſſes, yet as long as thou haſt not an hard heart, there are ſome hopes for thee.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">4. Inordinate love to ſome ſinne.</note>Fourthly, <hi>Inordinate and immoderate love to ſome luſt or ſinne:</hi> When a man is once enſlaved to ſome luſt, though he hath never ſo much light, ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction; yea, though he have never ſo many afflictions upon him, yet he will break thorow all to have his luſt ſatisfied. As <hi>Nero</hi>'s mother ſaid, <hi>Occidat modo imperet,</hi> Let him kill me, ſo he may reign. Thus let ſuch ſinnes damn me, ſo that I may have my will and deſire ſatisfied. What made <hi>Judas,</hi> though he had received ſo much love and kindneſs from Chriſt? Yet ſo perfidiouſly betray him into the hands of thoſe who had long ſought to kill him, but only he was a thief, and had an immoderate love to worldly-gain: It was thirty pieces that made him loſe body and ſoul; Oh it's an heavy thing to be captivated to any one ſin! Thou muſt have ſuch and ſuch ſins for thy darling ſinne: Oh this <hi>Dalilah</hi> will be thy ruine, as it was to <hi>Sampſon!</hi> Who would have thought that <hi>Sampſon,</hi> a godly man, as he is recorded <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. ſeeing what deadly enemies the Philiſtims were, would have diſcovered where his ſtrength was? But this <hi>Dalilah</hi> can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade him to his ruine: And thus <hi>Herodias</hi> can prevail with <hi>Herod</hi> to kill <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt, though he knew him to be a juſt man, and had a reverential fear of him; thy luſt, thy ſinne, thy whore, thy unjuſt gain can make thee fall down and worſhip the devil without any trouble of conſcience.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, <hi>Decayings from former expreſſions of holineſs or quenchings, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhing of ſuch motions as formerly have greatly affected us.</hi> Theſe commonly ſeek the Kingdom of darkneſs (as Chriſt ſpeaks of the Kingdom of Heaven) by force, and are violent for hell, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4. &amp; 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.20. The Scripture ſpeaks of ſome that have had great gifts of the holy Ghoſt, and have eſcaped through the knowledge of Chriſt, the pollutions of the world, if ſuch are intangled again they are worſe then ever, and there is no hope of recovery; Therefore none are in ſuch a deſperate condition as thoſe that once had greater workings of heart, and hopefull movings of conſcience, but ſince are groſly apoſtatiz'd, the prophaneſt men that live, who never caſt an eye towards heaven, are in a more hopefull condition then ſuch; relapſes are more dangerous in the ſoul, then in the body, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.45. when that unclean ſpirit was caſt out, but returned again, he brought ſeven other ſpirits more wicked then himſelf, <hi>and ſo the laſt ſtate of that man is worſe then the firſt:</hi> Look to this and tremble, you who have had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten checks of conſcience, and often wounds of heart, take heed they plunge thee not into an incurable condition: The water once heated, if cold again, is cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then ever.

            <p>WE come to obſerve a ſecond Doctrine from this remarkable inſtance, and certainly, if we conſider who it is that is here called <hi>a ſonne of perdition,</hi> it may be matter of aſtoniſhment to us. It is <hi>Judas,</hi> one of the twelve <hi>Apoſtles</hi>; It is he that for a long time continued with Chriſt work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing miracles, and propheſying in Chriſts name, yet even this glorious ſtarre is become a clod of earth: This <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> an <hi>Apoſtate</hi>; he that in all mens judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments was once a ſonne of the Kingdom, he that was the light and ſalt of the earth is in himſelf darkneſs, and is become like unſavoury ſalt, fit for nothing but to be thrown away. Obſerve,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That men may be eminent for a while in the Church of God, and yet afterwards prove dreadful Apoſtates.</hi> The beginnings of many men in Religion may be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hopefull and admirable, but their finals may be tragical and very ſcandalous. Thus <hi>Judas</hi> his beginnings were excellent. At firſt none more forward, more ſelf-denying then him, but afterwards we ſee this rod that ſcourged others for ſinne by his preaching, to become a Serpent; and ſee the wonderfull diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God; <hi>Paul</hi> that began carnally and wickedly, ended ſpiritually; he that was an oppoſer became a friend, and <hi>Judas</hi> that was a friend became an oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer. So that, will we, nill we, we muſt acknowledge Gods grace is <hi>all in all.</hi> It's that which makes a difference only; <hi>Bad beginnings may have good endings, and good beginnings bad endings.</hi> There are many meteors in the Church that make a luſtre and a blaze, but afterwards end in noiſomneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">What particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar eminencies <hi>Judas</hi> had.</note>To improve this Doctrine, Let us conſider what peculiar eminency <hi>Judas</hi> had, and this will make it the greater wonder, that he ſhould be a Son of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> And firſt, <hi>Which was the firſt riſe and ſtep to all other his excellencies, he was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from his former converſation into an inward &amp; more cloſe fellowſhip with Chriſt.</hi> We reade of three ſorts recorded by the Evangeliſts that related to Chriſt: Even as <hi>David</hi> had three ſorts of Worthies. There were thoſe that did believe in Chriſt, acknowledging him, yet continued ſtill in their relations, and former external conditions they were in, ſuch were many of the holy women we reade of in the Goſpels.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="373" facs="tcp:65216:206"/>2. There were ſome ſelected from the common ſort of Diſciples and belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, that did more immediately depend on Chriſt, and were imployed in ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial ſervice for him, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.1. There were Seventy choſen by Chriſt to be in an Office of Miniſtration and ſervice to him.</p>
            <p>But then there were a third ſort, and they were more intimate with Chriſt then the Seventy, and all the reſt, and they were twelve in number called <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,</hi> and theſe were as it were a Colledge, and Chriſt the Maſter, theſe were domeſtick to him, they were of his houſhold, they were never aſunder, they did eat and drink, and live, and converſe together, they were maintained out of one common ſtock and treaſury. Now <hi>Judas</hi> he was one of the twelve, he was received into the moſt inward communion together, he was one of Chriſts family: So that it muſt needs be a great honour and prerogative to <hi>Judas,</hi> who would have other thoughts of him, then a ſincere eminent man, for Chriſt choſe him to be in the firſt place, Chriſt made as much of him, as of the reſt. Who would not ſay, This muſt needs be a good man, Chriſt is ſo familiar with him; and whereas <hi>John</hi> 2. it's ſaid, <hi>Many did believe,</hi> yet Chriſt would not commit himſelf to them, for he knew what was in man, yet here, though <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> did not truly believe, and though Chriſt knew what was in him, yet he committed himſelf to him. This familiarity of <hi>Judas</hi> with Chriſt, was of old propheſied of, and that to the aggravation of his ſinne, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 41.9. <hi>It was thou my familiar friend, my acquaintance, we took ſweet councel together.</hi> Meditate then on this particular; The ſonne of perdition is he that was conſtantly with Chriſt, one of his intimate friends, of dear relation together, and this will ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate it more, if you conſider Chriſt and his Apoſtles, not as a civil ſociety, but a religious one: Though Chriſt did not in his life time on the earth ſet up a diſtinct Church from that of the Jews, but communicated with the Jews in all their Church-Ordinances, yet his family was a religious and heavenly ſociety. He was preaching, praying and performing all heavenly duties, now <hi>Judas</hi> was as much in all theſe holy meetings, as the other Apoſtles: Therefore it's ſaid <hi>Pſal.</hi> 41 9. <hi>They took ſweet counſel,</hi> yea it's ſaid, <hi>in whom I truſted</hi>; ſo that <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> was admitted into all the ſecrets Chriſt had, yet the man thus in prayer oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, in duties often, in heavenly conferences often, he becomes a <hi>Sonne of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi>; his heart was not right within him all that while: As for thoſe diſputes, Why Chriſt would chuſe ſuch an one, whom he knew to be an hypocrite, and eſpecially advance him to be an Apoſtle, ſeeing that the Scripture commends ſuch ſtrict care, about the promoting fit and worthy men to that Office, we can but give conjectures, no ſolid reaſons, as the Ancients do.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, <hi>This is but the beginning of honour Chriſt put upon him, for after they had a while continued thus with him, then he inſtituted a new Office of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtleſhip, and gave ſome men this divine Commiſſion and Office, the chiefeſt place in the Church:</hi> For you muſt obſerve, as a good Antidote againſt the Anabaptiſts, who becauſe Chriſt choſe Fiſhermen and illiterate perſons to preach the Goſpel, conclude ſuch perſons may ſtill preach, that there cannot be a ſtronger Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt them, then this inſtance of our Saviour; for when Chriſt choſe his Apoſtles, they left their trades, they did not continue in their civil vocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but they followed Chriſt, whereas theſe men would that perſons ſhould follow their trades, and yet preach alwayes, whereas <hi>Paul</hi> bids <hi>Timothy,</hi> though of extraordinary gifts, <hi>To give himſelf wholly to ſtudy and reading,</hi> 1 Tim 4.13.</p>
            <p>But ſecondly, Our Saviour after he had called them from their ordinary vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, he did not preſently make them Church<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o this Office, and then at laſt, when they were to exerciſe their Apoſtolical-Office to the whole Church, they were endowed with admirable abilities from above, ſo that they could ſpeak
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:65216:207"/>
in all tongues, and were filled with the Spirit of God, and infallibly aſſiſted by him, to interpret the Scripture of the Old Teſtament: But this by the way. We ſee by degrees men were prepared to this Apoſtolical Office in the Church, and <hi>Judas</hi> was one of theſe: Now this was the higheſt pinacle of the Temple. There was not a greater place of honour and truſt, then to be an Apoſtle, they are called the <hi>pillars</hi> and the <hi>foundations.</hi> Hence <hi>Paul</hi> begins his Epiſtle with this Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, <hi>Paul an Apoſtle of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> which is as great a glory, ſaith <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome,</hi> as when any Officer under the Emperour writes himſelf next in place to the Emperour. It would be impertinent at this time, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o expatiate in the digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and excellency of the Apoſtolical-Office. The Ancients ſaid they were <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des Chriſti, oculi Dei,</hi> and <hi>Eccleſiae mammae,</hi> Chriſts feet, Gods eyes, and the Churches breaſts. Theſe had infallibility in Doctrine, had power to work mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, to expell devils, to open and ſhut heaven (as it were) and yet <hi>the ſon of perdition</hi> is one of theſe Apoſtles.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, <hi>He had not only the Apoſtolical-Office, but the gifts and qualifications of an Apoſtle; He was one of thoſe that returned with joy, ſaying, The very devils were ſubject to them.</hi> He <hi>propheſied, he wrought miracles,</hi> he <hi>confeſſed</hi> and <hi>publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> the name of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> he <hi>prayed,</hi> he performed all the heavenly <hi>duties,</hi> that others did, neither do we reade of any neglect in his Apoſtolical-Office, nor is he blamed for defects in any religious duty, and certainly if he had been guilty of any ſuch omiſſions, the Apoſtles would have ſuſpected him, but we ſee when Chriſt ſaid, <hi>One ſhould betray him,</hi> they did no more ſuſpect <hi>Judas</hi> then them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, <hi>Chriſts carriage was as full of ſweetneſs, love and reſpect to him, as full of comfort and encouragement to him, as to the reſt, in an external diſpenſation.</hi> When they returned from their ſpiritual circuit, <hi>Rejoycing</hi> (as you heard) <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the devils were ſubject to them</hi>; our Saviour ſpeaks indefinitely to them all, <hi>Rejoyce not in this, but becauſe your names are written in heaven,</hi> Luke 10.20. he ſpeaks here, as if <hi>Judas</hi> his name were written in heaven, and <hi>Luke</hi> 22.30. Chriſt tels his twelve Apoſtles, <hi>They ſhould ſit upon twelve Tribes judging Iſrael.</hi> Little did men think that <hi>Judas</hi> would be caſt out, and one put in his room. Now lay all theſe together, and thereby will appear his eminency and eſteem in Religion, yet for all that he was a <hi>ſonne of perdition</hi>; for whereas <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> and others from the fore-mentioned Texts, would conclude that <hi>Judas</hi> was once a true godly man, but afterwards fell from his grace, that is contradictory to the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, as you have heard. And when our Saviour condeſcended to that low humiliation of waſhing the Diſciples feet (mentioned onely by <hi>John</hi>; ſo that the ſame Evangeliſt, who doth relate in moſt perſpicuous manner, the ſublimeſt things of Chriſt, as appeareth <hi>Cap.</hi> 1. ſo he mentioneth this action, which was of the loweſt debaſement) now in waſhing of their feet, <hi>Judas</hi> is not excepted. Thoſe hands of Chriſt which wrought ſo many miracles, cured ſo many diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, beſtowed ſo many bleſſings, yet even theſe waſh not the face, or the hands, but the feet, the meaneſt part, and that of <hi>Judas,</hi> who was immediately to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray him: But no wonder he layeth aſide his garments, and girded himſelf with a towel, and poured water in a baſon, ſeeing he formerly laid aſide the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of his Divine Nature, being in the form of a man, and poured out his bloud for us; yea, it's thought by many, and thoſe learned, both by ancient and learned Writers (though oppoſed alſo by many learned men) that Chriſt gave <hi>Judas</hi> the Sacrament alſo; Neither (ſay they) will this prove that ſcandalous men may be admitted to the Lords Supper, becauſe his ſinne was as yet ſecret, and not publick; and although Chriſt as God, knew him to be ſuch a ſecret ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, yet Chriſt did not in his outward Office of the Miniſtry, act according to the knowledge of God, but as a Miniſter under God in his Office. Whether <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> received or no the Lords Supper? Thoſe that affirm are many; Thoſe that
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:65216:207"/>
deny are alſo many. <hi>Raynardus</hi> the Jeſuite (<hi>Lib. cui Titulus vitae optimae finis peſſimus</hi>) at large quoteth the Authors of both ſides: Some make it a probleme, and therefore condemn <hi>Prateolus</hi> as too rigid, who noteth thoſe with hereſie, that deny his communicating with the other Apoſtles in this Sacrament.</p>
            <p>In the next place, Though thus eminent, yet conſider theſe things to debaſe him.</p>

He was a thief,</hi> ſaith the text. Chriſt had many contributers to his ſuſtenance, and that was put in a common bag for the maintenance of himſelf and his Apoſtles. Now <hi>Judas</hi> he carried the bag, how this came about it's di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputed, Whether he deſired it or no? or, Whether it was put upon him as judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a fit and faithfull man, the Scripture tels not? Howſoever we ſee by this, as is to be ſhewed, That it's a terrible thing to be in ſuch a condition of life, as is ſutable to draw out the ſinnes we are given unto, but of that afterward. <hi>Judas</hi> having this great opportunity, he ſtealeth part of the treaſury, and keepeth part of it for himſelf; What made him to do this? whether becauſe he was married and had a charge of children, as ſome conjecture; or, whether becauſe he had a covetous worldly heart, as the Scripture ſeemeth to encline, is controverted. So that now <hi>Judas</hi> becomes a groſs hypocrite, for the very light of nature taught him not to impropriate that which was common to others; he knew it was Chriſts goods, not his own; yea many learned Authors ſay, This was not <hi>ſimple theft,</hi> but <hi>ſacriledge,</hi> for what was given to Chriſt and his Miniſtry, was to an holy uſe, and therefore <hi>Judas</hi> was guilty of both; and the groſſeneſs of his hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie is the more aggravated, if he did believe Chriſt was God as well as man; How could he come into Chriſts preſence, and not think Chriſt knoweth my falſhood, my theft, and all my ſecret wickedneſſe.</p>

Again, <hi>He went to the chief Prieſts,</hi> he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeaks them firſt; they did not ſend for him, they thought not of this way, but he proffers himſelf, and he went to the chief Prieſts, his known enemies, that he ſaw had all along endeavoured to kill him. Further, his wickedneſſe appeareth in asking, <hi>What will you give me, and I will deliver him unto you?</hi> He pretends no reaſon, no cauſe, as the chief Prieſts did, <hi>That he was an enemy to Caeſar;
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:65216:208"/>
that he taught contrary to their law and cuſtoms</hi>; ſo that herein <hi>Judas</hi> ſin did more grievouſly then they.

When he had thus conſummated his wickedneſſe, though admoniſhed by our Saviour, though plainly told, <hi>He was the man,</hi> Matth. 16.25. Then in ſtead of a godly repentance, he fals into a dreadfull <hi>deſpair</hi> of Gods mercy, and Chriſts love. This was to put a talent of lead upon the Ephah, as the Prophet <hi>Zachary</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth it, <hi>Zach.</hi> 5.8. This deſpair was greater then all his former ſinnes, and obſerve how that all the while <hi>Judas</hi> was plotting and contriving his wickedneſs, his conſcience never troubleth him, he could live a long time in thieving and ſtealing, and commit abominable ſins, and his heart never trembles; Though he heard our Saviour ſay, <hi>Woe be to him that ſhould betray him, it had been better he had never been born,</hi> yet he can boldly go on; yea, though <hi>Judas</hi> was in the head of a band of men to take Chriſt; <hi>John</hi> 18.3, 5, 6. and as ſoon as Chriſt ſaid, <hi>I am he,</hi> ſuch glory and terrour came from him, that immediatly they fell to the ground, yet at this terrible paſſage his conſcience doth not work; but at laſt, his conſcience biteth like an Adder, and ſtings like a Serpent. Hearken to this all you, who commit ſin with jollity and ſecurity, you care not, you fear not, what the Miniſters of God threaten you with, <hi>you can eat and drink, and riſe up to play,</hi> ſo could <hi>Judas</hi> for a while, but at laſt, he crieth out, <hi>I have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in betraying the innocent bloud.</hi> Oh take heed, as jolly and as bold as thou art for the preſent, leſt in this life, or to come, thou crieſt out, Oh I have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, I have damned my Soul, yea I have betrayed Chriſt! For every wicked man is a <hi>Judas</hi>; Whoſoever will part with Chriſt for his ſinnes, for the world, he is a <hi>Judas</hi>; This <hi>ſonne of perdition</hi> doth thus roar within, that he hath no comfort, no quietneſſe, then firſt he goeth to the chief Prieſts, crieth out of his ſin, and throweth them the thirty pieces again. Here you ſee, <hi>A man may cry out and weep for his ſins, and make ſome ſatisfaction, and yet not for all that tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repent</hi>; Even this <hi>ſon of perdition</hi> bewaileth his ſins, and crieth out of them. Further ſee <hi>what little good this thirty pieces did him</hi>; he that ſtudied and plotted to betray his Maſter to have them, he cannot keep them, he vomitteth them up. Thus it will be with every wicked man, that to get diſhoneſt gain, lieth, ſtealeth, forſweareth himſelf: Oh with what pain and torment, with what torture in thy bowels wilt thou vomit up all again! Laſtly, His torments are ſo exquiſite, that for fear of hell, he throweth himſelf into hell; He departed when he threw away thoſe thirty pieces of ſilver, and went and hanged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27 5. Some learned men ſay, he did not hang himſelf, becauſe the Greek word may be rendered as well, He was ſuffocated and choaked: They ſay, God raiſed up a ſwelling in his throat upon his perfidiouſneſſe, which immediatly killed him; it muſt be ſo (ſay they) becauſe <hi>Act.</hi> 1.18. it's ſaid, <hi>He fell head-long, and his bowels guſhed out</hi>; now how could that be, if he hanged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf? But it's anſwered, That though he hang'd himſelf, yet at laſt he fell down, and in his fall, his bowels guſhed. Thus he who had no bowels to an innocent Chriſt, his bowels guſh out; The Greek word is uſed of <hi>Achitophel,</hi> by the Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuagint; and although the ſame Authors ſay, that he alſo did not hang himſelf, but God immediatly ſtruck him with ſuch a ſwelling in his throat, yet that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be, becauſe it's ſaid, <hi>He ſet his houſe in order</hi> before he did it, whereas if it had been a ſudden judgement inflicted on him, he not expecting it, Why ſhould he ſet his houſe in order?

            <p>The Third Obſervation ſhall be from the Conſideration of this Son of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in the reſpective condition he was in; He is in the company of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, yet not truly of them, a Jay among the Doves, a Wolf amongſt the Sheep, yet though ſuch an one prove deceitfull, and an Apoſtate, we are not to condemn Chriſt and his Apoſtles, we are not to cenſure them as all of the ſame temper.</p>

               <hi>though ſome amongst them prove ſcandalous and deceitfull</hi>; Would it not have been horrible impiety to have broken out againſt all the Apoſtles and Chriſt himſelf ſaying, look what they are, It's as the Phariſees ſaid, a company of Impoſtors and Deceivers, They are all for their own ends, they are all cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, and though they pretend Religion, yet they are bypocrites, and though they condemn the groſſe ſinnes of the world, yet in ſecret they can be as bad as any, would not ſuch a tongue ſhew that it was ſet on fire from hell, that ſhould belch out ſuch things; It's then of ſpecial conſequence to know, that we are not to love the ſtrictneſſe of Religion, the leſſe, nor are we to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice our ſelves againſt the way and perſons of Godly men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if ſometimes amongſt them there be ſuch who made the pretence of holineſſe a diſguiſe to act their wickedneſſe in: Think not the worſe of the Apoſtles, becauſe a <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> was amongſt them.</p>
            <p>To bring this Truth home to your hearts, Conſider theſe things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>There was never any ſuch pure Society and company of holy men upon the Earth but there were alſo ſome Hypocrites and inſincere men mingled amongst them</hi>; Either wilfull convinced Hypocrites or elſe unſound men in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome, and therefore when a Temptation came they diſcovered what they were; It's in vain to look for ſuch a Church, wherein all the members of it ſhall be perfect and pure; In the Old Teſtament we reade of many eminent at leaſt for a while in the Church of God, but yet rotten at the Coar; <hi>Saul</hi> was in a remarkable manner choſen by God to temporal government, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:65216:209"/>
much zeal for Gods people and heartily himſelf to deſtroy the enemies of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> yea, the Spirit of propheſie came upon him, but it became a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb, <hi>Is Saul among the Prophets?</hi> We were not to condemn the Prophets, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a deceitfull bloudy <hi>Saul</hi> was amongſt them: Among the good Kings in the Old Teſtament, <hi>David, Hezekiah,</hi> and <hi>Joſiah,</hi> We reade alſo of <hi>Jehu,</hi> who for outward appearance did many glorious things of Reformation; The Text ſaith, <hi>He did all things that were in Gods heart,</hi> yet for all that he was not with <hi>David, a man after Gods own heart</hi>: He was a Meteor, not a fixed Starre, he was a picture, not a living man in Religion, he was moved up and down as his carnal Intereſts did leade him; Again as there were the good Prophets, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> and <hi>Jeremiah</hi> with many others, ſo there were alſo the bad Prophets who came not in Gods Name, who propheſied peace, and ſowed pillows under wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked mens elbows, that they might ſinne the more ſecurely; Should a man therefore have cried out againſt all the Prophets that they were a deceitfull, ſelf-ſeeking generation, and that it was no matter what they ſaid, for they drave on their own deſigns, to be Lords over all, to obtain great things; Thus it was of old and in the New-Teſtament-diſpenſation though their outward profeſſion of the Truth was ſubject to many dangers, inſomuch that there was little encouragement to hypocrites we might juſtly think that (if ever) in thoſe primitive daies all ſhould have been upright, but there were even then Foxes amongſt the Sheep, <hi>John</hi> 2. Our Saviour would not truſt many that yet are ſaid to beleeve: Hence are theſe compariſons of the Church to the <hi>Floor,</hi> wherein is <hi>chuff</hi> as well as <hi>wheat</hi>: To the Field wherein are <hi>Tares</hi> as well as <hi>Wheat</hi>; To the <hi>Drag net</hi> wherein are bad Fiſh as well as good: Now will ye condemn a Field of Corn becauſe of ſome Weeds in it? Did not <hi>Paul</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain that <hi>he was in danger of falſe Brethren,</hi> and that many came creeping in to ſpy out their liberty to have an occaſion to accuſe them; Did not <hi>Hymene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> and <hi>Philetus</hi> make ſhipwrack of all? Did not <hi>Alexander the Copper-Smith withſtand</hi> Paul, <hi>and do him much hurt?</hi> 2 Tim. 4.12. yet judicious Divines think that it was that <hi>Alexander</hi> mentioned in the Acts, who had almoſt loſt his life, in his forward appearance for the Goſpel, make account then of that which our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18 7. It's impoſſible but that offences muſt come, there will be wofull ſcandals even in the Church of God, but let not this make thee revolt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As there have been ſuch unſound hypocrites alwaies in the Church, ſo it is the great endeavour of the devil to tempt and to ſet on thoſe that are moſt eminent to throw them in the mire, for hereby he will promote his own king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; The ſcandals and ſtumbling-blocks of men reputed of in the Church are the greateſt advantage to the devil, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. <hi>Satan hath deſired to winnow you</hi>; As <hi>Goliah</hi> challenged the ſtouteſt <hi>Iſraelite</hi> thinking by vanquiſhing of him to diſmay all the reſt; Thus the devil if he can overcome an Apoſtle, a Diſciple, then all the reſt will eaſily yeeld; The devil deſired to winnow them more then all others; Not only the high places in temporal reſpects but even in the Church are ſlippery and dangerous; Thoſe that are lifted above others in Religion, in parts, in eſteem, they are more in danger then ten thouſand of other Chriſtians, for if they fall they draw more with them: If a tall Tree fall, it beats down all the ſhrubs under it; If a pillar of the houſe fall, it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangers all the buildings; It is noted of the devil that he uſed the Serpent at firſt to entice <hi>Eve,</hi> becauſe that was more ſubtle then any other Creature of the Field, and the devil ſtill takes the ſame way, The ſubtleleſt and moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Inſtruments he ſtriveth to pervert them; Men of the beſt parts, the greateſt learning, the hotteſt zeal, It is ſuch as he looked after: Thus in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity many of the Heretiques were of great Learning, plauſible Eloquence, ſubtle Inſinuations, ſpecious Piety, and thereby they did the more hurt; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:65216:209"/>
the more reputed thou art in the Church of God, know thy Condition to be the more dangerous; The devil will never give over till one way or other he make thee a Scandall; Let him that ſtandeth take heed leſt he fall.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Men may through their corruptions actively take an occaſion to ſpeak a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the waies of Religion, or elſe there may be a paſſive occaſion admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred to them, and we are greatly to diſtinguiſh between theſe two, Divines call it <hi>Scandalum acceptum,</hi> and <hi>Scandalum datum</hi>; There are a generation of men ſo deviliſh and malicious, that they will take an occaſion to condemn the way of Religion even for good things, for neceſſary duties, or at leaſt when they have no juſt occaſion: Thus our Saviour himſelf though never ſo holy, ſo humble, ſo godly in his doctrine and life, yet the Phariſees took all occaſion to calumniate him, They ſay he wrought by the devil, and called him a Friend to Publicans and Sinners; There are ſome wretched men that do what you can they will be prejudiced againſt the Truth and Godlineſſe, They will look upon all the waies of Chriſt as ſo many deceits and impoſtures, and this of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence is called <hi>Scandalum Phariſeorum</hi> by the Caſuiſts; But then there is a Scandal given, or <hi>ſcandalum Puſillorum,</hi> when thoſe who appear for Religion do ſuch things as are indeed inconſiſtent with holineſſe, that can never be made good by the Scripture, and of ſuch it is that our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Wo be to him by whom offences come,</hi> Mat. 18.7. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall offend one of theſe little ones, it had been better a Millſtone were hung about his neck, and he thrown into the ſea</hi>; For although it be alſo a ſinne in any man to be prejudiced and alienated from Godlineſſe, becauſe of the ſinnes of thoſe that profeſſe it, neither will that be an excuſe to them, yet becauſe ſuch put a ſtumbling block in the way, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is the tranſgreſſion great: Diſtinguiſh then between ſuch as through their wilfull obſtinacy will be offended, and from ſuch who are ſo through weakneſſe and a reall occaſion given.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Such is the enmity of man to what is good, that he is glad to have any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to blame the Truth with, whenas indeed they ſhould mourn and grieve to ſee any failings amongſt thoſe that are religious, they rather rejoyce in the diſcovery of ſuch, and they think this is a good reaſon for their Impiety; Why ſhould they<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> come out from the common waies of the world? Do not many of thoſe that are ſo forward do thus and thus? And therefore they hope they ſhall do as well as any other: The Apoſtle ſeeing this wicked diſpoſition in the world ſpeaks notably to the godly, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.16. To walk with ſuch a good <hi>Conſcience, that whereas the world will ſpeak againſt them as evil doers, they may be aſhamed</hi>; So 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.12.</p>
            <p>Theſe things premiſed, Let us conſider the unreaſonableneſſe and ſinfullneſſe of condemning Religion for ſome hypocrites therein:</p>
            <p>For 1. Doſt thou not as well ſee many are ſincere and walk unblameably? Doth not thy own heart tell thee that thou haſt no juſt cauſe to ſpeak againſt them? Doſt thou not ſometimes wiſh thy Soul might do as well as theirs? Doſt thou not with <hi>Balaam</hi> wiſh thou mightſt die the Death of ſuch Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſons? Shall not the Graces and holineſſe of Eleven Apoſtles more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm thee then the wickedneſſe of one <hi>Judas</hi> offend thee?

               </gap>he ſtrong; Thou ſpeakeſt of many that for gain and ſecret luſts have fallen off from God, but how many thouſands of godly ſincere men can we tell thee of, who becauſe they feared God were neither terrified by threats, nor yet ſeduced by allurements to deny Chriſt; Though a <hi>Judas</hi> did betray him, yet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>here are Millions of Martyrs who have valiantly died in the Confeſſion of him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We are not to live by Examples but by Precepts, It's an Old Rule; We
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:65216:210"/>
are to conſider what the Scripture requires and commands, If that enjoyn a life ſeparated and ſingular to the wickedneſſe of the world, If that bid thee run not into the ſame exceſſe of Riot with them, ſuch a ſtrict way and profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion thou art bound to follow; Though all that go before thee be hypocrites, and that go with thee; Though all the Apoſtles had been like <hi>Judas,</hi> yet Chriſts Truth had ſtill been to be embraced; Therefore not mens lives but the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is to be ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Rule: If all men prove Hypocrites or Apoſtates, yet we are bound to keep cloſe to the Word, <hi>Let God be true and every man a Lyar</hi>; It's true the life and converſation of others in ſincerity and uprightneſſe may be a great inducement to holineſs, therfore the Scripture often cals for a life of light and holineſſe, that others may be won thereby, but yet every one ought to have ſuch an inward aſſurance both of the Truth of God and his Grace upon his heart, that what <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid preſumptuouſly they are to acknowledge as a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; Though all men ſhould forſake Chriſt, yet he would not; It's not upon men that we are to build either our faith or our godlineſſe, but though all men ſhould prove devils, and there were none in the world but one man that would own Chriſt, thou wert to joyn with him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If we ſhould condemn Religion for the falſhood of ſome, we were to condemn all the waies of Religion, and all parties in the world, and ſo to turn direct Athieſts, for look upon all the ſeverall waies and parties that are in the world, Are there not ſome that are a reproach to them, that the wiſer and more ſober perſons in that way will not own? Wonder not then if the Apoſtle ſay of ſome, that they are <hi>ſpots in their Feaſts,</hi> Jude 12. And <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. that they are ſuch <hi>by whom the Name of God is blaſphemed among the Gentiles</hi>; This hath and will be; It is <hi>impoſſible</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>but there will be offences,</hi> viz, conſidering the corruptions and ſinfull inclinations of men, but if you will own no Religion wherein an Hypocrite may come in, you muſt do as <hi>Conſtantine</hi> bad the <hi>Novatian</hi> erect a Ladder, and go himſelf only into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; Even in heaven it ſelf there were (as we may ſay) <hi>Judaſſes,</hi> for what were thoſe Apoſtate Angels that did not abide in the Truth, but left their firſt habitation, but betraiers of all that glory and honour that was due to God: Know then that to throw away Religion becauſe of the hypocriſie of ſome few, is to run the broad way into Athieſm.</p>
            <p n="5">5. It is not only ſinful but very dangerous to thy own ſoul when thou art prejudiced or leaveſt the true way upon ſuch grounds; Thou doſt not hurt them, but thou wrongeſt thy own ſoul; Thoſe Diſciples <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. that took of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence at Chriſts Preaching they did not deſpiſe Chriſt ſo much as they damned their ſouls, for ſaith <hi>Peter</hi> then, whither <hi>ſhall we go, for thou haſt Eternal Life?</hi> So then for thee to take up prejudices and objections againſt Chriſts way, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of ſome mens miſcarriages, is to be a ſelf-murderer, wilt thou deſtroy thy own ſoul? and throw thy ſelf into one extremity becauſe others may in another way undo themſelves; Oh know it is an heavy judgement upon thee when thou meeteſt with ſtumbling-blocks<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Thoſe whom God loveth he giveth a better heart unto them; Chriſt himſelf <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.7. <hi>To thoſe that beleeve is indeed precious,</hi> but <hi>a stone of ſtumbling, and a Rock of offence</hi> unto thoſe that do not beleeve; Oh then be afraid leſt this be the beginning of Gods judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon thee to be ſo prejudiced and offended by miſ repreſentations, that thou ſhalt never have an heart to love God and his way; Think not to do them a deſpight, thou art the greateſt Enemy to thy own ſoul.</p>
            <p n="6">6. If any under the pretence of Religion do act their iniquities quarrell not at Religion it ſelf, for that condemneth ſuch waies; Neither do thoſe that fear God own ſuch for their members, yea, where Gods Order is put in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe they caſt ſuch from them as a diſhonour to God and a reproach to that holy calling whereby we are called; If <hi>Achan</hi> do ſecretly ſteal a wedge of gold,

Is not the way of it as comfortable and as bleſſed as it did at firſt promiſe? Hath any thing that Chriſt ſaid for our encouragement to follow him proved falſe?

            <p>I Shall at this time finiſh the good Obſervations from ſo bad an inſtance. For as through the perfidiouſneſs of this <hi>ſonne of perdition,</hi> though he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended it not, God wrought the greateſt ſalvation that could be, inſomuch that in this ſenſe, we may call his fact an happy ſinne: So through a divine conſideration of this ſad example, we may receive the greateſt good, and with an holy skill turn this poiſon into nouriſhment; for the ſins and deſtructions of wicked men, are written for our inſtruction, as well as the good life and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the godly: As <hi>Abel,</hi> though dead ſpeaks, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o <hi>Judas,</hi> though damned, crieth to all, to take warning from him.</p>
            <p>Two Obſervations I ſhall briefly diſpatch at this time,</p>
            <p>The firſt, whereas you ſee <hi>Judas</hi> thus hopefully and forwardly beginning leaving all with the other Apoſtles to follow Chriſt, and that in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned, perſecuted manner, yet at laſt dreadfully and finally to revolt from all, Obſerve,</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 1. That unleſs men are care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full at firſt to look to their grounds and motives, why they take upon them the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Chriſts way, they will never hold out, but one time or other forſake and revolt from all.</note>
               <hi>That unleſſe men are carefull at firſt to look to their grounds and motives, why they take upon them the profeſſion of Chriſts way, they will never hold out, but one time or other forſake and revolt from all.</hi> A ſure and ſound beginning will ever have a bleſſed and happy ending, but when men upon ſlight and inſincere mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, look towards Chriſt at firſt, ſuch build upon the ſand, and their fall will be great. Our Saviour ſpake many Parables, eſpecially that of the fooliſh build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and of the ſtony and thorny ground, for this end, that men ſhould be well adviſed upon what terms they at firſt undertake for him. Hence it is, that when ſome voluntarily profered their ſervice and obedience to Chriſt, Chriſt preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly informeth them of the difficulty of that work, of the contrariety of it to fleſh and blood; that they had better never begin, then afterwards to fall off; hence he ſo ſolemnly bids them, to <hi>remember Lots wife,</hi> Luk. 17.32. and that he <hi>who hath put his hand to the plow, and looks back, is not fit for the kingdome of Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Seeing therefore this is often to be ſeen, though it be very ſad, That many who have been once zealous and hopefull for Gods way, yet afterwards decline totally, and are not the men they were: Let us conſider, what it is to ſet rightly at firſt upon the owning of Chriſt, to lay a ſure foundation at firſt? And</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Then are our beginnings hopefull, when the Spirit of God in the Miniſtry, or other means of grace did work upon us.</hi> When it was not meer education un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der good Governours, when it was not the acquaintance and company we had with thoſe that feared God, but ſome inward experimental work of Gods grace upon our own hearts. Alas, let a man be never ſo fervent, ſo overtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:65216:211"/>
others, and even to admiration ſhew himſelf in holineſſe, yet if it hath not been the work of Gods Spirit effectually moving upon his heart, he is but like a Land-flood, which though ſwelling high upon much rain, yet when a drought comes, will be preſently dried up. It's not meer nature, or externall reſtraint from ſinnes, or any ſudden motions in our own ſpirit, that will ever hold out. We reade 2 <hi>Chron</hi> 24.22. of <hi>Joaſh,</hi> who in his latter age did moſt wickedly degenerate, when yet in his former times he was very forward in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing the Temple of God, and ſhewed more zeal to Gods glory then the Prieſts did: But what was the ground? <hi>Jehoiada</hi> the high Prieſt had a great hand over him, he helped him to the Kingdom, and engaged him to God ſeveral wayes, but when this good man was dead, he becomes a Wolf, and puts <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariah, Jehoiada</hi> his ſonne, that had been ſuch a kinde Uncle to him, to death, and that meerly becauſe he reproved them for their ſinnes: So that though here was ſome external reſtraining of <hi>Joaſh,</hi> yet there was no internal renova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Gods Spirit: Now I make a ſure foundation to lie in theſe two, The Spirits work by the Miniſtry in an ordinary way, becauſe one is the efficient, and the other the ſubordinate and inſtrumental cauſe; Hence our converſion, our regeneration, and ſpiritual begetting anew, is conſtantly attributed to the Word preached, as the ordinary cauſe, and the Word preached is but as a dead letter without the Spirit: Oh then runne to the fountain of thy owning of Chriſt! What put thee upon forwardneſs in this way? Was it the Spirit of God through the Word? then this is of God, and will endure, I adde through the Word, becauſe of thoſe many deluſions many have in them, which being not according to Gods Word, as they come from darkneſſe, ſo they will end in darkneſſe. The Childe miſhapen in the Conception, will ever after be a monſter.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, <hi>Then will beginnings and endings be alike, when grace is radicated and enters <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ep enough into the ſoul.</hi> Though thou haſt never ſuch affections, ſuch en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largements, yet if there be not a rooted and deep work of grace upon thy ſoul, it will never hold. This our Saviour preſſed <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. The ſeed that grew up hopefully, miſcarried becauſe it had no rooting; and thus the houſe on the ſandy foundation was ruined, becauſe the builder did not dig deep enough. Hence the promiſe of Regeneration is <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. to put <hi>the Law of God in their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts,</hi> in the moſt intimate and deep parts of the ſoul; and therefore grace is called <hi>the inward man, and the hidden man of the heart:</hi> But ô how ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficial and overly! How formal are moſt in this matter? They undertake to own the wayes of godlineſs before ever they have laid a deep foundation. Hath thy repentance been deep enough, thy faith, thy love been rooted enough? If ſo, then the gates of hell ſhall never prevail againſt thee.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, <hi>Good beginnings will have bad endings, when men profeſſe Chriſt, not out of love to Chriſt, and pure intentions to him, but from ſiniſter and worldly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects.</hi> Oh this covering and hiding will never hold! The Wolf will be at laſt a Wolf for all it's ſheep-cloathings; and this was <hi>Judas</hi> his caſe, his end was not pure, his eye was not ſingle, and therefore his Apoſtaſie was inevitable: To follow Chriſt for loaves, or to know him only after the fleſh, will never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure; <hi>All fleſh is graſſe,</hi> Iſa. 40 6. <hi>but the word of God abides for ever,</hi> that is; not only the body of man is mortal, but all thoſe wayes of righteouſneſſe and holineſſe, which are not indeed, regeneration will certainly vaniſh. This is a great part of the meaning, if you compare this place with the whole context, 1 <hi>Pet</hi> 1.23, 24, 25. <hi>Jehu</hi> begins with zeal as hot as fire, yet his latter end was like <hi>Jeroboams,</hi> for he walked in his wayes, and all becauſe his ends were not pure. Oh this is the ſumme of all! This is the ſoul and life of all. Obſerve di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently thy heart in the intentions and motions of it: Is it to have applauſe? Is it to be reputed of? Is it to accompliſh great things for thy ſelf? Thus we may
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:65216:212"/>
ſay of thy godlineſſe, what is it thy body? <hi>Duſt thou art, and to duſt thou wilt return</hi>; The time is coming thou wilt not have a ſtone left upon a ſtone of that religious building, though once ſo many did ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire it.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, <hi>Then hot beginnings will end coldly, when the judgement of a man is not well inſtructed and informed in the truth.</hi> Hot affections, but a weak judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will quickly reel up and down, as a man that hath ſtrong vapours from his ſtomack, but a weak brain: Therefore our Saviour prayeth in this Chapter, <hi>That they may be ſanctified through the truth. Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Philetus,</hi> when they made <hi>ſhipwrack of the faith,</hi> then they caſt away a good <hi>conſcience:</hi> So that a ſound minde and judgement is a ſpecial preſervative to perſeverance: What is the reaſon children are toſſed up and down with every new thing? But becauſe their underſtandings are weak; and <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. we are forbidden to be like children in this reſpect; As there muſt be a ſound judgement in the truth, ſo a well adviſed Meditation about the nature of grace, and how dear it will coſt thee to be Chriſts Diſciple. To come into the company of the godly before thou haſt throughly bethought thy ſelf, what is required of a Diſciple? How much he muſt do and ſuffer? What he ſhall meet with in the way? is the cauſe of great hypocriſie. Our Saviour doth fully expreſſe this under two Parables, One of a man going to warre; and another who undertakes a great building, <hi>Luke</hi> 14 31. There is none will ſet upon a warre or building, but with much councel, whether he be able to go through with it, or no; Whether he ſhall not be mocked, as one that began and could not make an end? Thus do thou reflect upon thy ſelf, What ſhall I go and joyn my ſelf with thoſe that fear God? Shall I be in the number of thoſe that will own Chriſt more ſtrictly then the world? Am I fit for ſuch a great work? Am I mortified to all ſinne? Can I endure to loſe all for Chriſt? Do I love him better then all relations, and life it ſelf? If I do not, it's no climb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up this hill, I ſhall tumble back again with greater danger then ever. I ſhall adde no more particulars, becauſe all miſcarriages may be reduced to one of theſe heads.</p>
            <p>Uſe. In the firſt place of <hi>Inſtruction.</hi> Though zealous beginnings may ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribly degenerate, yet it's a bleſſed, and an happy thing to be working for God betimes; Though a man called at the twelfth hour into the Vineyard, ſhall be rewarded, yet it is a bleſſed thing to be one of the firſt in Gods Vineyard; to be as <hi>Timothy</hi> was, godly in the youth. The wicked world, as they have many Proverbs to encourage themſelves in their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſo this is none of the vileſt, <hi>A young Saint an old Devil:</hi> This <hi>Gerſon</hi> cals a blaſphemous Proverb, and ſaith, His heart did often tremble to hear men ſay,
<q>Angelicus Juvenis ſenibus ſatanizat in Annis.</q>
Men take up this ungodly Proverb to procraſtinate their converſion, to delay their repentance, to diſcourage early lookings towards heaven, as if all that did begin ſo ſoon, would turn devils at laſt. Though <hi>Judas</hi> did thus play the hypocrite, yet <hi>Timothy,</hi> godly from the youth, did not. Therefore be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ginne even this day, this hour, onely look thy beginnings be ſound and ſincere.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Uſe of <hi>Exhortation,</hi> To take heed of proving a <hi>Judas,</hi> How odious is his name? It's a Proverb to expreſſe a treacherous, falſe hearted man, to ſay, He is another <hi>Judas,</hi> and <hi>Judas</hi> his name is ſo abominated, that though in it ſelf it be a good name, ſignifying as much as one that confeſſeth and praiſeth God, yet I think there was ſcarce ever any Chriſtian would name his childe <hi>Judas,</hi> his actions are ſo abhorred, and yet for all this, How many are like <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,</hi>
               <pb n="383" facs="tcp:65216:212"/>
and ſo ſonnes of perdition? Apply it but in this one thing, <hi>Judas</hi> his high iniquity was, out of his covetouſneſſe to betray Chriſt for thirty pieces of ſilver, for a little profit he would loſe Chriſt. Now is not this the caſe of moſt wicked men in the world? Whoſoever loveth any plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure or profit more then Chriſt, he is like <hi>Judas.</hi> The drunkard is a <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,</hi> he ſels Chriſt and his ſoul for his drink. The whoremonger is a <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,</hi> the unjuſt dealer is a <hi>Judas,</hi> all theſe ſell Chriſt, ſometimes for leſſe then <hi>Judas</hi> did. It's not thirty pieces, but a leſſe matter makes thee betray Chriſt. Oh then that all inordinately carried away with any ſinne, would ſay, What a <hi>Judas</hi> am I, I let looſe <hi>Barabbas,</hi> and crucifie Chriſt!</p>
            <p>The ſecond Obſervation may be this, Whereas <hi>Judas</hi> had this condition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen him, which did draw out his corruption, and ſo was the means to undo him, Obſerve,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That it's a very ſad thing to fall into ſuch a condition,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 2. That it's a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſad thing to fall into ſuch a condition that draweth out our peculiar corruptions, we are moſt prone unto.</note> that draweth out our peculiar corruptions we are moſt prone unto.</hi> This was the poiſon to <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,</hi> he being naturally inclined to unjuſt gain, hath this office of carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the bagge, and thus he hath the opportunity of augmenting his impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. How he came about to be put in the Stewards place, men do but conjecture. Some ſay, It was his earneſt endeavour and plot for it. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, That Chriſt did it to engage him, and to make him more inexcuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. To be ſure, This was to him as <hi>Dalilah</hi> to <hi>Sampſon</hi>; as <hi>Saul</hi> thought <hi>Michall</hi> would have been to <hi>David</hi>; as the Ivy to the Wall; it was as Moths to the linnen, even eating him up, and conſuming of him.</p>
            <p>To open this, Conſider,</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Conſider. </seg>1</label> Firſt, <hi>That men are ſet in places, relations and habitations by God.</hi> All our relations, changes and offices, they are wholly ordered by God, yea our very places and habitations they are bounded; and certainly, if thoſe things that ſeem to be moſt caſuall, are yet by the ordering of a wiſe God, much more thoſe things that are of a greater concernment. Hence</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>God doth not onely order all conditions and paſſages towards us, but he doth it in reference either to our ſpirituall welfare or diſadvantage. Rom.</hi> 8. To the godly, <hi>all things work together for their good</hi>; Whatſoever eſtate, mercy, or condition they are in, it's the effect of their Predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; ſo that as Ordinances and Graces flow from their Predeſtination, ſo do all other their outward mercies and conditions, onely here is this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, The Graces of Gods Spirit are intrinſecally apt of themſelves to prepare for happineſſe, and ſo are the direct effects of it; but temporall mercies, they are not ſo, but <hi>propter aliud:</hi> Therefore we are not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſaid to be predeſtinated, to be rich, to be poor, to be married, to live a ſingle life; as we are to be holy, becauſe theſe outward conditions are only indifferent in their natures, but through the grace of God, they become very ſerviceable to their ſpiritual good.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Though God hath thus a wiſe ordering of all things, yet men by their corruptions may throw themſelves into ſuch conditions, as may prove oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions to ſinne unto them, and then thoſe things are permiſſive onely from God. Jacob</hi> had the bleſſing, this was of Gods appointment, but his deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full way of obtaining it, was wholly of his own corrupt heart. <hi>David</hi> was appointed by God for a Kingdom, but then the many ſinfull and carnall ſhifts he uſed that was of himſelf. It's true, the godly even from their fooliſh miſcarriages, if humbled, may be encouraged, God will work good to them thereby, as <hi>Joſeph</hi> comforted his brethren; It was not they but
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:65216:213"/>
God that had ſold him: But now to wicked men, they for their ſinnes are left by God, and therefore not taking Gods way in any thing, they have their conditions in anger, and they become a ſnare unto them, as <hi>Salomon</hi> had obſerved, That riches were given to ſome for their hurt. Thus every eſtate, that a wicked man hath, provoking God to leave him, doth increaſe his corruption; it's oyl to the flame, <hi>He treaſureth up more wrath againſt the day of wrath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hence in the fourth place, <hi>That which a wicked man may ſo greedily long for, and break through all difficulties to obtain, that may be the ſaddeſt judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to have in the world.</hi> Some men inordinately deſire earthly greatneſs and honour, and they have it, but Gods judgement they have with it. Some are inordinate for riches and wealth, they will be rich, but then they drown themſelves in perdition Others with <hi>Rachel</hi> ſay, <hi>Give me children, elſe I die,</hi> and her children make her die. So that as beaſts leap and play in fat pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures, which are for their deſtruction: Thus many a man he rejoyceth and bleſſeth himſelf in having of that, which when enjoyed is the immediate poiſon of his ſoul.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Here is the difference between a godly man and a wicked, <hi>To the wicked man his relations and calling are a totall and prevailing temptation to him, the fire kindleth upon him, and cannot be quenched; It's like hell fire, that cannot be put out; But now to the godly man his calling and relations may in part tempt him, be a ſore thorn in his way to heaven, but yet he will recover, he will watch and pray againſt his temptations.</hi> Though the world may as <hi>Joſephs</hi> miſtreſs ſollicit and importune him, yet he will refuſe to lie with her; or if this viper hath faſtened upon his hand, it ſhall not ſtay to kill him, he will caſt it off.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of Examination.</hi> Try your conditions, your relations, obſerve whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be not conſtant <hi>Dalilahs</hi> to thee: Again and again conſider, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thy condition be not a temptation to thee? It's true, no godly man can be in any lawfull calling, but it tempts him to deadneſs of heart, to dull affections in heavenly things, but if they do not wholly turn thee from God, then thy conflicting in it, is a ſure ſign of grace. It's made the wicked mans condition, <hi>That his table ſhall become a ſnare,</hi> by that is meant, all his dainties, all his worldly greatneſſe and excellencies, and that ſuch a ſnare, as he doth willingly yeeld unto. Therefore renew prayer conſtantly, that thy heart, and the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation be not loſt together.</p>

Here you ſee are clear evident places containing a Prediction of what would befal <hi>Judas, David</hi> ſpeaks by way of bitter Imprecation againſt his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable and crafty Enemies, who ſet againſt God and his cauſe in him and this was a Type of <hi>Judas</hi>: Indeed <hi>Junius</hi> relateth this paſſage in the Text, not only to <hi>Judas</hi> his perdition, but alſo to all thoſe ſeverall places of Scripture, which ſpeak of Chriſt and his office in ſaving of his people, but that ſeemeth not ſo accomodated to the Context.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Theſe words are not ſpoken to take off the cauſe of perdition from <hi>Judas,</hi> and to lay it upon the Scripture or Gods previſion, but only (as you heard) <hi>to prevent the offence,</hi> the Diſciples might take; Therefore <hi>Calvin</hi> ſaith well, that the Scriptures meer prediction is <hi>not the cauſe of an Event</hi>; Neither did
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:65216:214"/>
               <hi>Judas</hi> periſh, becauſe the Scripture ſaid ſo; Indeed no predictions whether divine or humane, as Aſtronomicall, politicall, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are the cauſes of any E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent: Things are not therefore becauſe foretold, but they are foretold be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe future; This is true of prediction or previſion meerly as ſo, not including preordination in it.</p>
            <p>Hence 3. The particle <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> that is taken two waies in Scripture, ſometimes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noting a cauſe, Sometimes an Event only, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, as the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed inſtance in many places; Now here they make it to ſignifie the Event on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the ſence amounts to thus much, when <hi>Judas</hi> had betraied his Maſter, and periſhed in that wickedneſſe, then were thoſe places of Scripture fulfilled; The Scriptures did not force or compell him, but when he had accompliſhed his impieties, then was the Scripture fullfilled; Indeed <hi>Tolet</hi> makes it to be cauſall, and <hi>Maldonate</hi> cauſall, apparently but not really; <hi>Janſenius</hi> grants it may be cauſall, not in reſpect of <hi>Judas</hi> his ſinne but the end why God permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all this.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Though Gods previſion and the Scriptures prediction be not ſimply the cauſe of any thing future, yet becauſe Gods previſion is never without his pre-ordination, and that though wicked men are juſtly damned for their ſins, yet all theſe things fall not out without ſome antecedent Decrees of God; Therefore we muſt underſtand this place as taking in <hi>Judas</hi> his Reprobation alſo.</p>

            <p n="2">2.

The Scripture ſaith there again, <hi>There muſt be Hereſies,</hi> That neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ariſeth both in reſpect of mens corruptions, and alſo in reſpect of Gods wiſe permiſſion, that ſo the <hi>approved and ſound may be made manifeſt</hi>; It's no little part of a Chriſtians wiſedom in the overflowing of Hereſies, when men of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral waies ſpeciouſly pretend to Truth and Piety, to know how to deport our ſelves, and ſo to walk that we do not <hi>fall from our ſtedfaſtneſſe</hi>: Now there is not a ſurer Buckler to keep off theſe poiſonous arrows from our breaſts, then to ſtrengthen our ſelves with powerful Conſiderations out of the Scripture: Thus it muſt be, Thus it will be; The Scripture again and again tels us of it, men of great Eminency and repute may make ſhipwrack of their Faith, and through deceivableneſſe and ſubtle inſinuations will draw many after them; Wonder not at this when it comes to paſſe, That is notable to this purpoſe, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.29, 30. Though <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf had inſtructed thoſe Churches, yet he tels them after his departure that Wolves would venture in amongſt them, what a ſad change would this be, But from whence ſhould they come? <hi>Even out of your ſelves will ariſe men</hi>; Thus theſe Toads and Serpents would breed in Gods own Garden: As the Leproſie of Hereſie is thus a Scandall in Gods Church, So the Apoſtacy and revolt of ſuch as were once forward for the Truth; To have them degenerate, yea, ſometimes to become malicious Enemies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt what they profeſſed, this is very hard, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. and 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. mention is made of ſome who were endowed with eminent gifts, and much outward Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, yet they are ſuppoſed to fall away, and ſo to fall as never to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover again; Let it not then ſtumble thee if there be ſuch who will for earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly advantages betray Chriſt after much love pretended to him; That will ſell

Chriſt for ſilver, Do not thou loath Religion for this; Do not thou begin to ſay, Are there any Religious even in this world? Do not thou follow them, thinking I may do, as they do? But rather tremble at ſuch Inſtances, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how terrible their latter end will be.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>When for the profeſſion of the Truth and Piety we finde our neareſt friends and ſuch as ought moſt to encourage us to ſet againſt us,</hi> yea, to betray us, and to work our Deaths if it were poſſible, though this be very hard to bear, yet ſay as in the Text: This is done <hi>that the Scripture may be fullfilled</hi>; If Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf complain <hi>it was not an open enemy, but thou my familiar friend, we took ſweet counſell together, that did lift up his heel againſt him,</hi> that is proudly, contemptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, and bloudily ſet againſt me,: Do not thou expect a better condition then Chriſt thy Maſter, eſpecially attend to that place, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.34, 35. <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.52. where the conſequent of the Goſpel preached is to ſet the neareſt relation one againſt another, ſo that for thy Godlineſſe ſake neither Father or Friend may own thee, yea, the wife of thy boſome will betray thee, ſuch things have fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len out in times of perſecution, and therefore be not offended at that which the Scripture hath foretold.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>That Antichriſt ſhould prosper and prevail; even to the ſhedding of the bloud of ſo many thouſand Martyrs, and yet meet with no remarkable judgement would be an unanſwerable Temptation, had not the Scripture foretold it</hi>; The Scripture informeth of a twofold Antichriſt, a <hi>doctrinall</hi> one, ſuch as <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks of, that denieth Chriſt to be come in the fleſh, and a politicall Antichriſt, or one that is chiefly ſo, in reſpect of Church-Government, who yet alſo ſhall be doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally Antichriſt, of whom <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh that he ſhall <hi>exalt himſelf above every thing that is called God,</hi> and of which the Revelation makes often mention, for although this Antichriſt ſhall prevail, and the greater part of the earth ſhall receive the mark of the beaſt, yet at laſt the time will come when thoſe joyfull Songs ſhall be ſung, that <hi>Babylon is fallen,</hi> and the judgements of God are juſt, who hath avenged <hi>himſelf upon the Beaſt</hi>; Let not then <hi>Bellarmine</hi> glory in his temporal felicity as a mark of the Church; Let him not ſay in ſuch a daring manner, If the Pope be Antichriſt, and the man of ſinne aimed at in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, Why have not horrible judgements from heaven overtaken him? All this is eaſily anſwered, The Scripture foretels he ſhall have a <hi>time,</hi> and he muſt for a while make his <hi>garments red with the bloud of the Saints</hi>; But as certainly as he doth this, ſo alſo ſhall his perdition come as certainly; Wonder not at this, or be offended, for the Scripture muſt be fulfilled.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>The manifold exerciſes and conflicts that Gods own Children have ſometimes about the guilt of ſinne, and ſometimes about the power of ſinne, makes them think there was none ſo in the world before; Oh how ſhall they bear it, there is no mans condition like theirs, you cannot hear one reade of the like,</hi> ſay they; But do not all theſe troubles ariſe from ignorance in the Scripture?

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> Thirdly, <hi>We have the promiſing part of the Scripture.</hi> The Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> did not more richly flow with milk and honey, then the Scriptures abound with all kinde of promiſes both for this life, and that to come. This heaven is full of ſuch glorious ſtarres. The Apoſtle 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. cals them <hi>precious promiſes</hi>; precious both in reſpect of the things promiſed, and alſo of the certainty and truth of them. There is the grand promiſe of all the Charter of the Covenant of Grace, <hi>I will be their God, and they ſhall be my people:</hi> and this is ſubdivided into many particulars; ſo that there is not a good thing to be deſired, nor an evil thing to be avoided, but we have a promiſe for it; and certainly, if the word and promiſe of a great man in place and power be able to refreſh the heart of an indigent man, how much more muſt the promiſe of the Almighty and holy God revive thoſe that depend on it? All the children of God are with <hi>Iſaac</hi> called <hi>the children of the promiſe,</hi> Gal. 4.28. ſo that they are the children of the promiſe <hi>efficiently,</hi> as it was the meer promiſe of God, that gave them a ſupernatural being, all humane power being as impotent for that purpoſe, as <hi>Sarahs</hi> womb was to conceive; and further, <hi>They are the children of the promiſe</hi> (as I may ſay) <hi>objectively,</hi> becauſe they live on that, and are nouriſhed by it; and as they ſay in naturals, ſo it is true in ſpirituals, <hi>Ex eiſdem conſtamus è qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus nutrimur,</hi> The procreating and conſerving cauſes are of the ſame nature; hence we may read of the godly looking up to Gods promiſe in all their diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77.8. and when God ſtirreth up himſelf to do good to his people, it's becauſe he remembers his holy promiſe. Inſomuch that heaven and ſalvation it ſelf, is called, <hi>The hope of the promiſe,</hi> Act. 26.6. Though therefore the people of God have not all the good things they deſire in preſent poſſeſſion, yet they have them in promiſe, and Gods truth is bond and ſecurity enough. A man that hath not his eſtate at command, yet if he have it in ſure bonds and good ſecurity, looks upon himſelf as a rich man: Oh then the unbelief and vile doubtings of thy heart! Are all the promiſes of God of no repute with thee? Are they of no credit? Should they not as much aſſure thee as if every thing were accompliſhed already? Hence as the Scripture when it ſpeaketh of a future thing, uſeth the preſent tenſe, to ſhew the certainty of it, as the learned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in many places; ſo ſhould the faith of a godly man turn the future tenſe into the preſent, and what God ſaith he will do, to take as done al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready.</p>

Ark there is the Rod as well as Manna; Chriſt hath not only a <hi>Scepter of grace,</hi> but a <hi>Rod of iron</hi>; and thoſe threatnings are farre above the terrors of the moſt cruell men that ever lived; for it's not onely a threatning of bodily miſeries, but of hell, of eternal wrath and vengeance on the ſoul, as well as the body, which no earthly man can do. Therefore whatſoever the word of God hath ſaid againſt an evil man, let him look for it, as if he were already under that doom. Is not <hi>Judas</hi> here called a <hi>ſon of perdition,</hi> yea is he not ſaid to be <hi>periſhed</hi> in the preſent tenſe, becauſe of the certainty of it? Doth not the Scripture ſay, <hi>He that believeth not, is condemned even already?</hi> Joh. 3.8. As when God at firſt threatned <hi>Adam, In the day thou eateſt thereof thou ſhalt die</hi>; This was made good, though <hi>Adam</hi> did not actually die at that time, becauſe he was put into a ſtate of death, and every moment that ſentence might be inflicted on him. Thus it is with every wicked man, whatſoever curſe, whatſoever vengeance is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced againſt thee, this night, this day, this moment it may be fulfilled on thee.</p>
            <p>The ground why the Scripture muſt be fulfilled, is plain,<note place="margin">Grounds why.</note>

               </note> The Scripture hath as many promiſes for thee, as thou canſt deſire. It's full of glad tidings to thee that feareſt God. There is not a Chapter but it ſpeaks ſome good or other to thee. Oh do not think theſe things are ſpoken in vain, and not to be good, to be true! What ſhall the holy Spirit of God become falſe to deceive and delude thee? Farre be ſuch blaſphemous thoughts from thee; Go then and rejoyce, ſay, I have enough, I have all things, the Scripture abounds with all conſolations, and not one drop of this precious wine ſhall be loſt or ſpilt to the ground; but on the contrary it ſpeaks woe and trembling to wicked men: Oh how well were it for you, if the Scripture were a book of fables and lies! Then thou mightſt eat, and drink, and riſe up to play and ſport, but at the laſt thou wilt finde every word of it to be true: Why then can thy bold heart endure any longer? Is there not terrour enough in the Scripture to break it in peeces, though it were of iron. Thou wilt finde at laſt God only true, but man, and the world, and thy own heart a liar.</p>

            <p>I ſhall at this time conclude this Text which hath been ſo fruitful in ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual matter, but before I come to make the laſt Obſervation let us Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In how many ſences the Scripture may be ſaid to be fulfilled,</hi> For there are divers waies of underſtanding this, and indeed there is ſcarce any thing more difficult in Religion, then to make an happy reconciliation of the places quot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the New Teſtament with the Old; At the firſt view of many of thoſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legations, you would think there were violent deflections of the Scripture to another ſence, then was intended, but we Chriſtians beleeve that the ſame Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit which breathed on the Prophets, did alſo inſpire the holy Apoſtles for the right interpretation of them; Though therefore the Solution of every diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty ſurpaſſe the ability of the moſt Learned Interpreter, yet we are to capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate our underſtandings to the Truth of the Scripture, and not the Scripture to our Underſtandings, and nothing will better facilitate a right Underſtanding of Scripture-allegations then to know that the Scripture may be ſaid to be full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled two waies,<note place="margin">In how many ſences the Scripture may be ſaid to be fullfilled.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Properly. 2. Improperly, and by way of accomodation.</p>
            <p>Properly, and that two waies, Either in a <hi>literall</hi> ſence or a <hi>myſticall</hi> ſence; A <hi>literall</hi> ſence either is <hi>ſimply</hi> ſo when it's a meer prediction of what is to come, and hath no Type for the preſent to be verified in, of this kinde or ſort are many Examples eſpecially, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 7.14. <hi>Behold, a Virgin ſhall conceive and bear a Son,</hi> Matth. 1.22. applied to Chriſt; This was onely true of Chriſt and his Mother, not applicable to any elſe, for as for <hi>Muſculus</hi> and <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> who conceive that this was done in a Type, and that ſame Virgin in thoſe daies did marry and bear a Son, which was a Type of Chriſt is wholly impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, and diminiſheth this glorious Myſtery of Chriſts Incarnation.</p>
            <p>As for the ſecond kinde of fulfilling which is a <hi>compounded</hi> ſence of the Type and Antitype that is often; Thus theſe things which were fulfilled about the <hi>Paſchal Lamb, the braſen Serpent,</hi> about <hi>Jonah, Solomon,</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo applied to Chriſt as the Antitype; As alſo <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11. that of bringing the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt</hi> unto Chriſt, Though theſe places alſo may be

               <hi>That it's a ſure Argument and Demonſtration of the Divinity of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, That it doth foretell things which long after do come to paſſe; Judas</hi> his perdition in the Text was propheſied of many hundred years before;<note place="margin">The truth of Scripture-Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies.</note> As God endowed men with ſuch illumination that they could tell what was done ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years before they lived, as appeareth in <hi>Moſes</hi> his writing of the Hiſtory of the Creation, ſo it doth no leſſe wonderfully appear in a prediction of ſuch things as ſhall come hereafter, and therefore both the Old Teſtament and the New have two Books that are wonderfully prophetick of what ſhall befal the Church in after Ages; <hi>Daniel</hi> propheſied ſo in his time, and <hi>John</hi> did the like in his <hi>Revelations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To open this Doctrine Conſider,</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>That it is only Gods property to foreknow things to come</hi>;<note place="margin">I. It is only Gods property to foreknow things to come</note> We matter not thoſe wretched Socinians who deny any preſcience in God, becauſe they ſay this would enduce an abſolute neceſſity, and it would be as vain a thing to think to avoid what God doth foreknow as what he doth preordain; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they take away one as well as the other, but this is impudently to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict the Scripture which doth ſo often make preſcience a property belonging ſolely to God, obſerve that place <hi>Iſa.</hi> 41.21, 22, 23. ſhew the things that are to come hereafter, that we may know ye are gods, and indeed he only can know future things that only knoweth the hearts of men, and that the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture attributeth to God only; Indeed the Prophets who were but men, yet they did foretell many things to come, but they were only miniſteriall in this, It was God that revealed theſe things to them, ſo that it was not they ſo much as God, and thus the Scripture revealeth things to come becauſe it's the word of him who knoweth all things, and it's the writing of ſuch who were imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly inſpired by the holy Ghoſt; Now one reaſon why God muſt needs fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>know what is to come, is becauſe nothing can ever be without his decree pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictive of it, and ſo becauſe God knoweth what he will do, therefore he knoweth what ſhall be; Therefore we need not with the Jeſuites run to a <hi>ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entia media,</hi> whereby God knoweth all things they ſay from the infinity of his knowledge, comprehending the nature of things antecedently to his Decree, their actions abſolutely future or conditionally only, for his knowledge is founded upon his decree.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Although God only doth originally and by his own property know things to come, yet the <hi>devils they may foretell ſome things</hi>;<note place="margin">II. Yet the devil may foretell ſome things to come.</note> Not that the devils can of themſelves foreknow any future caſuall thing, for they know not the hearts and free wils of men, yet ſome things they certainly foreknow, ſome things with great conjectures, certainly they know ſuch things which God revealeth to them, and employeth them in to bring about, for ſeeing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the very devils are Inſtruments of bringing about his vengeance, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by that, when God commanded the <hi>lying ſpirits to be in the mouth of the falſe Prophets,</hi> as alſo when they <hi>appeared before God</hi> as well as the Angels, <hi>Iob</hi> 1. Seeing (I ſay) God uſeth theſe as Inſtruments, no wonder if he make known unto them what Service they have to do, and therefore they can fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell things, yea, the Lord ſuffers falſe Prophets ſometimes to foretell things by
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:65216:218"/>
way of judgement to a people, as is to be ſhewed, for not only to godly men but even to wicked men God hath ſometimes revealed things to come, as to <hi>Balaam,</hi> and thoſe <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. who ſaid, <hi>Have we not propheſied in thy Name?</hi> But beſides this revealed knowledge the devils may probably foretell things to come, partly as <hi>Auſtin</hi> well obſerveth, becauſe of their intellectual acuteneſſe, having ſuch extraordinary quickneſſe in theit underſtanding, and this added to their long life which they have had ever ſince their Creation, and partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their agility whereby they can quickly move from one place to another, as it's related of <hi>Apollonius Thyancus,</hi> who being at <hi>Epheſus</hi> when <hi>Domitian</hi> was murthered at <hi>Rome,</hi> cried out, Be of good courage, for at this moment the Tyrant is killed. Hiſtorians write, that Poſts came afterwards that did confirm all thoſe things about <hi>Domitians</hi> Death; Now if this were ſo, then it was by the help of the devil, who could quickly move ſo far, as that <hi>Apollo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> did many other things, and therefore is thought by ſome to be raiſed up by the devils to oppoſe Chriſt, and draw off from him by falſe Miracles.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">III. Predictions of three ſorts.</note>Thirdly, Conſider <hi>there may be predictions of three ſorts</hi>; divine, ſuch as are of <hi>God himſelf,</hi> or by Prophets inſpired by him, or <hi>diabolcicall</hi> predictions, which are by Gods juſt judgements ſuffered to be upon a people, and theſe are either by the devil, or by his Inſtrumenss, Witches, and Sorcerers, Aſtrologers, and other kinde of waies of Divination which are too common even amongſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, or humane and natural predictions, which are from natural cauſes to their natural effects; Thus the Aſtronomer may foretell the Eclipſes that ſhall be, The Phyſician can the effects of ſome Diſeaſes, and ſo the natural Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher may, but not with ſuch certainty, foretell of drought or much rain, as our Saviour implieth, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.20. but this is only probable, becauſe many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular cauſes may interpoſe and alter all their prognoſtiques: Thus alſo <hi>poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick</hi> Predictions which wiſe men ſometimes can preſage about Commonwealths; Though thoſe are but Coniectures, as he ſaid, <hi>Bene qui conticet, hunc tu perhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beto vatem optimum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">IV. How vain and wicked it is to go to Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers or Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, or to be ſuch.</note>Fourthly, Seeing that to foretell any thing to come be thus the property of God and of the Scripture, Then by this we ſee, <hi>That all thoſe who go to Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logers or Witches to know things to come, and all thoſe that profeſſe judiciary A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strology,</hi> that will undertake to foretell not natural things but voluntary, ſuch as are meerly ſubject to mens will, <hi>Do not only undertake a vain raſh, and falſe thing, but that alſo which is very abominable and wicked</hi>; It's neceſſary to ſpeak to this, becauſe there are many people look more to the fullfilling of what ſuch Prognoſticks and Almanacks ſay, then to the Scripture, as if <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> did reign, therefore the Earth muſt tremble, and not <hi>God reign</hi>; It would require a great Volume to ſpeak of this exactly, Onely briefly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider theſe things.<note place="margin">Againſt A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrology and Witchcraft Conſider,</note>

Of old there were the Heretiques <hi>Priſcillianiſts,</hi> that did binde men to the Starres, and made the body of men to be compounded according to the Signs, yea, into this ſoul errour <hi>Aquila</hi> that famous Interpreter of the Scripture fell, for which he was caſt out of the Church of God; and <hi>Cardan</hi> roſe to that high Impiety, as to obſerve Chriſts Birth, and made his power to do the Miracles he did to flow from the influx of thoſe Starres that he was born under. Some have not been ſo wicked, yet others, as <hi>Petrus de Aliaco</hi> thought by the Stars there might have been prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſticated the Birth of Chriſt; And <hi>Kepler</hi> contends, thoſe Wiſe men by the Rules of Aſtrological Art, might have preſaged not only an Event of ſome great

moment but the Birth of ſome great Monarch; As if Chriſt were not born af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter an extraordinary and miraculous manner; That the Heavens have influence upon the bodies of men may not be denied, Though <hi>Pererins</hi> argueth againſt thoſe <hi>Coeleſtes influentias,</hi> as I remember; Hence a man poſſeſſed with the devil is called <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>lunatick,</hi> which ſome ſay was becauſe the devil took the occaſion, that at what time of the Moon humours did moſt abound, then to diſturb him, and no doubt but that the Heavens were made for glorious ends<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but not to be Books to reveal what ſhall come to paſſe.</p>
            <p>Therefore that you may reſt ſatisfied, <hi>That the Scripture only can infallibly tell what is to come to paſſe,</hi> and that it is a high wickedneſſe and preſumption to run to <hi>Witches, Sorcerers,</hi> or judiciall <hi>Aſtrologers,</hi> take theſe following Arguments.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>All thoſe places of Scripture which forbid any reſort to them</hi>; Conſider that place <hi>Lev</hi> 19.26. <hi>Ye ſhall not uſe inchantment nor obſerve times,</hi> So <hi>Lev.</hi> 20 27. <hi>Deut.</hi> 10.11, 12, 13.

You ſee here by clear and plain Texts all ſuch predictions are an abomination to God, and if we ſhould urge beſide divine authority humane, this would be enough to confirm us, all the Fathers ſpeak with much vehemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy againſt them, many Councels have condemned ſuch practiſes, yea, divers Heathens have condemned them, for the greateſt Aſtrologers, <hi>Ptolomy</hi> himſelf, as the Learned ſhew, acknowledgeth no certain Truth can be foretold by them, <hi>Tully</hi> wrote ſeveral Books <hi>de Divinatione,</hi> condemning ſuch Diviners, as <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de div.</hi> inſtancing that before a great Fight ſome Mice had gnawn the Buckler of a Souldier, the Soothſayer concluded, the War would be fatal and unluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ky, as if (ſaith <hi>Tully</hi>) becauſe the mice did gnaw ſome Books which I had of <hi>Platoes de Repub.</hi> therefore I ſhould conclude that our Commonwealth ſhould be deſtroyed; The very Heathens abhorred ſuch Divinations, and we reade <hi>Act.</hi> 19.19. of many when converted brought their curious Books, and burnt them, which is not to be underſtood of meer witchery and Sorcery Books, but of thoſe that are given to vain and couſening Arts; Otherwiſe the holy Ghoſt would not have expreſſed thoſe wicked Books under ſo vile a Name as <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> As Authority doth condemn, ſo Reaſon, as we may reade at large in <hi>Pererius, Spanhemius, Zanchius,</hi> and others. For</p>
            <p n="1">1 If the Heavens were true and proper cauſes or neceſſary Signs, yet no man could prognoſtique certainly by them, <hi>becauſe no man knoweth the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Stars,</hi> nor the vertue and efficacy of them; The Scripture giveth it as peculiar to God, that he only knoweth the Stars, and cals them by their Names, but if any man could certainly divine by them, he muſt know both the number of the Stars, and their peculiar activity or influence, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of that activity, without which they may groſly erre:</p>
            <p>Again, If the Heavens be cauſes they are only Univerſal Cauſes, now <hi>from an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal indeterminate cauſe there cannot be any ſpecial particular effect fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told</hi>; For beſides Univerſal Cauſes, all particular interiour Cauſes, which are many and uncertain, muſt be known alſo.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, <hi>This would bring a Contempt of God, and meer Athieſm into the world</hi>; The Scripture carrieth us out to God in all things, to his Wiſedome, to his Power, to his Juſtice, but theſe would binde us to the Planets, yea, by theſe means the Scripture alſo will be deſpiſed and laid aſide, ſo that all propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe will thereby be introduced, yea, and excuſes for all Vice will be plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed how could they help it? Seeing they were born under ſuch a Starre, as <hi>Auſtin</hi> reports of an <hi>Aſtrologer</hi> handſomely reproved by his Servant, He had a Servant that ſtole from him, and this Aſtrologer his Maſter going to correct him, he cryeth out, I could not help it, I was born under <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi> (They ſay, thoſe born under that Planet are given to ſteal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;)

Thus by his Maſters own principles and Rules of Art he convinced him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> One Objection they much urge, is that they often foretold what is true.</p>
            <p>To this it is anſwered, <hi>And many things have been as falſe and untrue,</hi> and if one thing fall out, it is more obſerved then if an hundred things prove o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, beſides when they foretell many things, it's hard if they cannot foretell ſome one thing, as a blinde man that ſhoots many arrows, may chance once to hit the mark.</p>
            <p>But then 2. If ſuch things do come to paſſe, it's either by their expreſſe or virtuall compact with the devil; and if not ſo, as <hi>Auſtin</hi> well obſerveth it's from a juſt judgement of God to thee, that thou ſhouldſt have wherewith to ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and fall, and undo thy ſelf, <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.1.

That they might

for ever remember theſe words before his death Chriſt knew they muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict with great difficulties, therefore he provides ſutable conſolations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Obſerve,</p>

               <hi>That it's Chriſts ſpecial will and care, that his people ſhould walk comfortably.</hi> As <hi>Ahaſhuerus</hi> did not like to ſee <hi>Nehemiah</hi> look ſadly: ſo neither doth Chriſt will that his people ſhould walk with dejections and diſcouragements, but abound in an heavenly and unſpeakable joy. It's a diſhonour to a Prince to have ſighing ſubjects; Therefore in <hi>Nero</hi>'s time to weep or ſigh, was a capital crime, and it reflects upon a Maſter to have his ſervant walk with diſcontent: Thus it's a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhonour to Chriſt, and to his Goſpel, when thoſe that fear God walk without hope or faith, ſtill complaining that their ſouls are diſquieted and caſt down within them. A Chriſtians joy is ſo greatly aimed at, that the ſumme of thoſe valedictory Sermons, and large farewell diſcourſes Chriſt makes to his Diſciples, was to eſtabliſh them therein, <hi>John</hi> 15.11. <hi>Theſe things have I ſpoken that your joy might remain, that it might be full.</hi> It's not only joy, but a conſtant full joy he requireth, that it might remain: The people of God are not to think it enough to have joy ſometimes, though they are to bleſs God for any degree in the leaſt continuance, but they are to keep this fire alwayes upon the altar of their hearts, whatſoever may not continue with them, yet their joy muſt; Though we cannot finde thee alwayes thriving, alwayes healthfull, yet we ſhould ſee thee alwayes joyfull; we ſhould never finde a Chriſtian without this, let his conditions and temptations be never ſo ſad, and then it muſt be a full joy; not a light flaſh, but ſuch as ſhall fill up thy heart, that ſhall ſoak to the root of thy ſoul, that no or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary thing can remove thee from it. This point is of great concernment unto the godly, who commonly think themſelves <hi>Benonies,</hi> and will not be called <hi>Naomi,</hi> but <hi>Marah</hi>; that with <hi>Rachel, refuſe to be comforted</hi>; that as ſome wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men will not hear of the threatning, but <hi>put farre from them the evil day</hi>; ſo they ſtop their ears againſt the promiſe, and put the good day of Gods grace out of their minde.</p>
            <p>Now although I ſhould firſt ſhew, the nature of Chriſts joy, what it is, and how it is to be fulfilled in believers, yet I muſt firſt diſpatch <hi>Chriſts end in this prayer, and all other his diſpenſations,</hi> viz. <hi>That the joy of the godly may be filled in them.</hi>
               <note place="margin">That Chriſt doth really in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that his people ſha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Not to live comfortably is a ſinne, as well as not to live holily; and take heed of quenching Gods Spirit, as it is a Comforter, as well as it is a ſanctifier. For that it is a main intent of Chriſt to have you cloathed with the garments of joy, will appear by theſe particulars:</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">I. Therefore was this prayer.</note>Firſt, <hi>This ſolemn and remarkable prayer, which our Saviour did make with ſo much fulneſs of heart, was for this end, to fill them with joy.</hi> Though Chriſt praid for impetration of the benefits mentioned in this prayer, yet the end why he ſpake this prayer ſo ſolemnly in the ears of the world, was that it might be a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual ſtanding ſtock of comfort to the godly. Therefore the Apoſtle <hi>John,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the other Evangeliſts pretermitted this prayer, and much of his farewell Sermons, is very large and exact in the deſcription of it: ſo that the Spirit of God thought it not enough to have it vocally pronounced, but alſo to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to writing, that ſo all the generations to come might take comfort from this prayer: If therefore the godly man conſider, what Chriſt here prayeth for, and who it is that doth pray; The dignity of his perſon, the certainty of being heard; if there were no other Scripture remaining but this, there would be ground enough of joy. For the things which uſually ſad the hearts of Gods children, are either from within or without; from without are all the oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and cruel uſages they meet with in the world by wicked men. Theſe are thorns and goads in their ſides: Theſe are wolves to the ſheep, and where they cannot ſuck their blood, yet they are briars and thorns, to tear and rend their wool off. Now our Saviours prayer is ſufficient to turn this water into wine, he makes us
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:65216:220"/>
to gather grapes even of theſe thorns. He ſheweth this is matter of joy, and not ſorrow; for thoſe ſadding thoughts which ariſe from within us, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed are the heavieſt, as becauſe of their corruptions which are ſtrong in them, their proud, earthly and unbelieving hearts, as alſo their proneneſs and danger to apoſtatize one time or other, to ſuffer ſhipwrack; Our Saviour doth expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly provide cordials againſt theſe faintings; The petitions are ſo direct and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat againſt ſuch decayes, that thou mayeſt afore-hand with <hi>Paul</hi> triumph, and challenge any creature in the world, to hinder thee of the Crown of Glory: Oh then in the midſt of all thy perplexed thoughts within, remember this prayer of Chriſt! Look not upon it as once ſpoken by Chriſt, and ſo paſſing away; but know it is as efficacious and powerfull in operation as ever; length of time hath not diminiſhed from the vertue of it; if Chriſt were now upon earth, and in thy cloſet or chamber praying with thee, it ought not more to refreſh and comfort thee, then when once in the fleſh poured out by him; yea ſome have thought, that the expreſſion, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. of <hi>Chriſts prayer and ſupplication with ſtrong cries and agonies,</hi> hath reference to this prayer, though his tears and agonies, are not mentioned: Howſoever Chriſt alwayes praid with ſuch zeal and fervency, that he was ſure to be heard: See then, if the want of any thing, which may diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage thee, may not be provided for in this prayer; and ſhall Chriſt do it for this end, that thou mayeſt alwayes have comfort? And yet art thou dejected, What ſhall Chriſt die in vain, and pray in vain? So certainly, whileſt thou walkeſt thus uncomfortably, it's as if Chriſt had done none of theſe things, or elſe had done them in vain.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Chriſts care and will, that the godly ſhould live comfortably,</hi>
               <note place="margin">II. Therefore is it ſo often commanded.</note> 
               <hi>appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in thoſe many commands, for to rejoyce.</hi> So that there is no command for any holy duty, or to avoid any ſinne more frequently enjoyned, then to walk with joy and gladneſs of heart, the people of God they doubt whether they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, they think ſuch barren and unprofitable wretches as they are, may not apply comforts; They think this childrens bread doth not belong to ſuch dogs, as they are; Oh but remember how indiſpenſable and peremptory the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God is, that thou ſhouldſt walk joyfully before him! <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, my brethren, Rejoyce in the Lord</hi>; When he had exhorted to many duties before, he keepeth this ſweet wine to the laſt. Finally, I have no more to ſay, this is the ſumme of all, do ſuch and ſuch duties, but ſtill remember to rejoyce: Oh to pray dejectedly, to do holy duties, but with a ſad heart, this is to marre all! As in alms, ſo in all other duties, God <hi>loveth chearfulneſſe</hi>; but he ſaith, <hi>Rejoyce in the Lord</hi>; Thy joy muſt be in heavenly objects, and from ſpirituall motives, from Evangelical priviledges; ſome joy in their honours, ſome in their pleaſures, ſome in their luſts, as the ſwine delights in mire and mud; but the joy of Gods people is in and through Chriſt: Therefore he ſaith, <hi>That my joy may be fulfilled in them,</hi> not the joy of the world or the fleſh: Hence <hi>verſ.</hi> 3. it's made the ſure character of a Chriſtian indeed, who hath more then the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward form of religion, that he rejoyceth in Chriſt Jeſus: But as if once ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing were not enough, ſee how the ſame Apoſtle doubleth it, <hi>Cap.</hi> 4.4. <hi>Rejoyce in the Lord alway, and again I ſay, Rejoyce.</hi> Certainly there is ſomething in it, that the Apoſtle ingeminateth it, <hi>Again, I ſay, Rejoyce,</hi> he knew how hardly the people of God are brought to rejoyce; How can they that are thus afflicted, that have ſo many exerciſes, bid them <hi>Rejoyce,</hi> you may as well bid an heavy log flie up into the air? Alas, they are ſo oppreſſed and hardened in heart, that they can no more rejoyce, then a ſtone ſpeak: But the Apoſtle will hear none of theſe excuſes, I ſay it again, <hi>Rejoyce,</hi> and that alwayes, let your condition, your temptations be what they will, let the times be what they will, yet <hi>rejoyce alwayes</hi>; ſo 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.16. <hi>Rejoyce everm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>re</hi>; Do not think it arbitrary or left to thy choice to walk joyfully. No, awe thy heart with the command, that as
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:65216:221"/>
thou dareſt not lie, ſteal, commit adultery, becauſe God commands the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; ſo neither dareſt thou walk with diſtruſt, unbelief and diſcouragement, becauſe Gods word is againſt it.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">III. And for this end are the promiſes.</note>Thirdly, <hi>Chriſt hath provided for the Chriſtians comfort not only by commands, but alſo by promiſes.</hi> The Scriptures are like a pleaſant garden full of the ſweet flowers of the promiſes, therefore called 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. <hi>Precious promiſes</hi>; you may obſerve, that the promiſes run through the heart of the Scripture, as thoſe four rivers did paradiſe, to water and refreſh it. Hence it's ſaid, <hi>That we through the Scriptures might have conſolation and comfort,</hi> Rom. 15 4. Hence <hi>David</hi> in all his tribulations found the word of God <hi>ſweeter then the honey or the honey-comb.</hi> There cannot be any ſtrait, any grief, but there is a peculiar promiſe againſt it; ſo that if at any time thou art diſconſolate, either publick or private afflictions lie ſore upon thee, remember the promiſes, encourage thy ſelf from them: Oh walk not as if this world were ſuch a wilderneſs, that God had provided no foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains to refreſh the barren ſoul! As it was a cuſtom amongſt the Jews to give a cup of wine to the condemned perſon to refreſh and comfort his ſpirits, There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was the height of malice in the Jews, when in ſtead of ſuch a cup they gave Chriſt gall to drink. Thus God hath alſo appointed in his word ſo many precious and glorious promiſes for his children in every condition, and the devil on the other ſide, he would give them gall to drink: If then thou wouldſt live with heavenly joy, let the promiſes be thy meditation day and night.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">IV. And the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel.</note>Fourthly, <hi>Chriſt hath provided for the comfortable life of his people, by appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Miniſtry in his Church, among other ends, for this, to comfort the afflicted ſoul, and to pour oyl into the hearts of ſuch as are wounded.</hi> They are to be ſons of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, like <hi>Barnabas</hi> to the children of ſorrow for their ſins; ſo that it's one of the greateſt parts and work of the Miniſtry to publiſh <hi>glad tidings, and to preach the acceptable year of the Lord</hi> to ſuch as groan under the burden and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their ſins; Chriſt himſelf accounted of this in his Miniſtry above all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50 4. <hi>He hath given me the tongue of the learned, to know how to ſpeak a word in ſeaſon to him that is weary:</hi> Oh it's not every one that can deal with a tender conſcience; we muſt have an Eagles eye, and a ſoft hand; ſo that our work is not only to convert the prophane, to build up the converted, but to be daily comforting and exhorting the afflicted in ſoul! And ô that there were many upon whom we might diſpenſe this part of our Office? You are apt to ſay, Miniſters preach nothing but damnation, they will not comfort ſuch as lie a dying: Oh there is nothing more deſired by them, then to meet with ſuch humbled ſouls, to whom they might milk out the breaſts of conſolation! To ſuch they ſay, as in the <hi>Canticles, Eat ô friends, yea drink abundantly</hi>; but it would be a woe to us, if we ſhould tender theſe comforts to wicked and impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent men. There is a notable place to this purpoſe, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 13.22. where God threatens the wicked Miniſters, becauſe they ſtrengthned the heart of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked in promiſing of him life, and made the heart of the righteous ſad. When therefore we have to do with the contrite heart, we with-hold no comfort from him, as the Apoſtles ſtyle themſelves, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.24. <hi>Helpers of the believers joy:</hi> So that in this is our ſtudy and labour ſeen, as well as in Doctrine and reproof.</p>

Joh. 15.26. Joh. 16.7. Even thoſe who pleade to render the word <hi>Advocate,</hi> and not a Comforter, yet it comes to this at laſt, Seeing the end of all his actions is to bring Conſolation into the afflicted Soul, That as the Spirit of God moved at firſt on the waters, to make a lightſome and glorious world, ſo he doth on the waters of the broken in heart, to make as it were New Heavens, and a new Earth there, where was nothing but horrid confuſion; That as the devil is the <hi>Prince of darkneſſe,</hi> is alwaies accuſing and troubling the godly endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to bring them to horrour and deſpair, Therefore he kept the poſſeſſed party about the ſolitary Tombs, and endeavoured that the Inceſtuous perſon ſhould be ſwallowed up with overmuch ſorrow; So on the contrary the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God is wholly to comfort, to ſupport, to revive, and to make glad the grieved in Spirit, inſomuch that the Hebrews have a Proverb, <hi>Super maeſtum non cadet Spiritus Sanctus,</hi> for this Reaſon ſay ſome Learned men the Prophets before they could propheſie ſometimes took an Inſtrument of Muſick to play on, as <hi>Elijah, Iſaac</hi> would eat of Veniſon, to refreſh his Spirits before he did prophetically bleſſe his Children, Howſoever the Spirit of God being expre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly called a <hi>Comforter,</hi> it's plain, that in all his operations and workings he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends ſolid and true joy, called therefore <hi>Joy in the holy Ghoſt,</hi> not only <hi>obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively</hi> but <hi>efficiently,</hi> becauſe it is wrought by him, and indeed we need the Spirit of God to comfort us, for we cannot attain to this joy by our own ſtrength, That as we need the Spirit of God to regenerate us, becauſe <hi>dead in ſinne,</hi> So alſo to comfort us becauſe under the <hi>guilt of ſinne,</hi> We are like ſo many <hi>Judaſſes</hi> and <hi>Cains</hi>; Naturally we are a barren wilderneſſe, not only in reſpect of graces, but alſo of Conſolations; Look upon many afflicted and tempted Children of God, No Friends, No Miniſters can comfort, Reade the

And wherein, or what ſinne eſpecially? <hi>Even becauſe they would not beleeve in Chriſt</hi>; Oh this is a ſpeciall mercy, when the Spirit of God hath by the Goſpel ſo farre convinced thee, that thou ſeeſt it thy duty to beleeve, to rejoyce, for who is there when once feeling the burthen and weight of ſinne, doth not with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> run and hide himſelf, doth not conclude, his ſins are greater then he can bear? It's not for ſuch a wretch as I am, to have a drop of water to refreſh me, much leſſe a drop of Chriſts bloud, yea, his whole bloud; Hence when we come to a tempted Chriſtian, we may admire at the ſubtleties and ſtrong Objections he can bring againſt his comfort: Never did any Heretique more ſubtilly and pertinaciouſly oppoſe the Truth of Chriſt, then ſuch an one will object againſt the Promiſes, So that you heard it was <hi>the tongue of the Learned,</hi> Iſa. 50.4. that could know to ſpeak a word in ſeaſon to ſuch wearied perſons, yea, to this day are not the Proteſtant Writers conflicting with the Papiſts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the particular application of Chriſt to every Beleever, aſſerting that it is every Chriſtians duty to ſay with <hi>Paul,</hi> Gal. 2. <hi>who loved me and gave himſelf for me</hi>; Now this particular appropriation of Chriſt to a man, is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of all joy and peace: And do not the Papiſts bring all thoſe Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that a tempted Chriſtian is apt to produce, Such as theſe Gods Promiſes they are indeed true, I doubt not but God is able, only I queſtion my ſelf whether I have ſuch conditions and qualifications as are required for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes? Again the Promiſes are general, whoſoever ſhall beleeve or repent, ſhall finde mercy, but my great fear is, whether I do truly repent or beleeve; Yet again, They object, as <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> the heart is deceitfull: how many have perſwaded themſelves, they do repent and love God, when indeed they doe not, and it may be I am ſuch an one.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, They doubt not of Gods power (they ſay) or of his ability to pardon all their ſins, and to juſtifie worſe ſinners then themſelves, Only here is the Queſtion whether God will or no, God hath no where in his Word ſaid, Thou ſuch an one, thy ſins are forgiven thee; Theſe and the like Objections which Popiſh Writers urge with much vehemency, The tempted Chriſtian preſſeth with great ſtrength, becauſe ſuch are in a contrary diſpoſition to beleeving, and ſo feel nothing but ſinne in the guilt of it, and Unbelief doth as much deceive and diſturb the ſoul, as Melancholy or madneſſe will the fancy.</p>
            <p>I have been large in this, to ſhew what mighty and gracious work of Gods Spirit, that is, to inſtruct, and convince the heart of this duty, to beleeve and rejoyce, to be able to ſay, God delights not in theſe perplexed thoughts, as he ſaith of theſe ſuperſtitious duties ſo theſe immoderate fears and dejections, <hi>Who hath required theſe things at your hands?</hi> I ſhall anſwer for unbeleeving ſorrows as well as carnall mirth, for thoſe dejecting fears and unquiet trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of ſoul, Thou art to fear hell and damnation as well as for Licentious jollities.</p>

Oh then as the wiſe men when they ſaw the Starre that directed them to Chriſt, rejoyced with exceeding great joy, ſo when the Spirit of God ſhall direct thee by the word into this ſupernatural way of rejoycing bleſſe God for thou mightſt have wandred through dark and uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable waies into hell it ſelf.</p>

            <p>THeſe words are the finall cauſe of Chriſts ſolemn prayer for his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. Wherein you have,</p>

            <p>The <hi>Benefit</hi> it ſelf is, <hi>My Joy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This may be underſtood Actively and Paſſively; Actively, for that joy which Chriſt might take from his Diſciples, being preſerved in purity of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Unity amongſt themſelves. Thus ſome underſtand it, and parallel a like place, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.2· where <hi>Paul</hi> bids them <hi>fulfill his joy,</hi> which was the joy he would take by ſeeing their happy agreement; but becauſe it's ſaid in the Text, That this joy may be fulfilled in the Diſciples themſelves. Therefore it is more conſonant to underſtand it paſſively of that joy, which the Diſciples took in him, and the benefits flowing from him: So that it may be called Chriſts joy, both effectively, becauſe he is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour and giver of it; as alſo objectively, becauſe it is in him, in divine and holy things, not in the world much leſſe in the pleaſures of ſin.</p>
            <p>Now the <hi>Manner</hi> of poſſeſſing is, that it may be <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>That there is a joy in Chriſt which his people are to have ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in them.</hi> As they are to be filled with grace, ſo with conſolations, and one floweth from the other, though not naturally: It's of great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment to treat of this joy, becauſe the people of God look upon it as a thing above their reach. They are convinced of repentance, of humiliation; but not of walking joyfully.</p>
            <p>There is a three-fold Joy:</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="408" facs="tcp:65216:224"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. A <hi>Naturall Joy,</hi> which is an implanted affection in a man, and of it ſelf ſimply conſidered is not a ſin.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. There is <hi>a Sinnefull Joy,</hi> which runneth into two ſtreams, either when the <hi>Object is wholly unlawfull,</hi> when it's a forbidden Tree, and we may not eat of it; And thus to rejoyce in our evil doings, to take de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the wayes of wickedneſſe, this is a wicked joy, that will end in tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting ſorrow, and it argueth a wretched diſtemper of the ſoul, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it would finde ſinne to be terrible and bitter, but through the corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted conſtitution of the heart, it comes about that they delight in ſinne, as diſtempered ſtomacks do in coales, aſhes, or ſuch droſſe. Again, there is a ſinnefull joy, when the <hi>Object matter is lawfull,</hi> but then we <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in the meaſure,</hi> in the <hi>bounds</hi> or <hi>limits,</hi> we over-joy. The water runnes over the bank, and then it gets ſoyl, and it's as hard to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in theſe things, and to ſinne not, as it is to be angry, and ſinne not.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. There is a <hi>gracious and an heavenly Joy,</hi> when the ſoul delights it ſelf in God and Chriſt, in all heavenly Objects: For though to wicked men theſe things are a burden, yet to an heavenly heart they are the moſt connaturall Object: They are the proper center of the ſoul, as <hi>David</hi> often profeſſeth his joy in the Lord: It's of this we are to ſpeak of, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we muſt inform you ſomething of joy in the generall. The Philoſophers ſpeak of a three-fold affection ſutable to one another: There is Love, which is carried out to an Object that is good ſimply conſidered: There is Deſire which moveth to ſome good thing, but abſent, and not yet ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained: And then there is Joy, which ariſeth from the obtaining and poſſeſſing of it: And anſwerable to theſe, there are Divine Graces, and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural works of Gods Spirit in the ſoul.</p>
            <p>There is the <hi>Love of God,</hi> which next to Faith, is of the greateſt glory and activity in the ſoul.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There are <hi>Deſires and earneſt longings after God,</hi> to which hunger and thirſt, a promiſe is made, of being fully ſatisfied.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There is <hi>Joy, which ariſeth from the enjoyment of God,</hi> onely you muſt know there is <hi>Gaudium viae,</hi> a joy we have while in the way to Heaven, which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of much increaſe, and meeteth with much oppoſition; and there is <hi>Gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium Patriae,</hi> a joy in Heaven, where the ſoul will then be ſo filled, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not receive any more.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">To know the nature of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Joy Conſider</note>To know the nature of this Joy, Conſider,</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt <hi>That the efficient cauſe of it is onely God.</hi> The Spirit of God is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Comforter,</hi> as you heard, becauſe he alone poureth it into the heart, as the Heavens onely give rain, and it's called <hi>Gal</hi> 5.22. <hi>The fruit of the Spirit,</hi> which doth imply, that it comes ſolely by Gods Spirit, and that there is excellent ſweetneſſe in it: Luſts are called the <hi>workes of the fleſh,</hi> but this with other Graces, <hi>The fruit of the Spirit.</hi> Hence it is, that as in reſpect of Regeneration, <hi>the Spirit bloweth where it liſteth:</hi> So alſo in reſpect of Conſolation, How many of Gods children walk with much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, and abound in much joy. And others again, go bowed down, and greatly tempted, not obtaining comfort, though they would give a world for it: So that as the Husbandman cannot have rain when he would, nor the Merchant winde when he would, neither can the godly have comfort when they would, as appeareth by <hi>David,</hi> praying ſo earneſtly for <hi>the Joy he had loſt</hi>; It's the <hi>fruit of the Spirit</hi>; Therefore joy doth not flow from Graces exerciſed, as by a natural reſultancy, as heat doth from the fire, and light from the Sunne, but by Gods voluntary diſpenſation of it. The Schoolmen uſe to ſay, That a man doth not merit (that is their proud
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:65216:224"/>
phraſe) by rejoycing in God, or good things, but by his Love, which was antecedent, and from which joy (they ſay) floweth by a naturall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity; But the Scripture makes theſe two, Love and Joy, two diſtinct works of Gods Spirit, and that they are ſeparable, experience confirmeth it; for many men that are high in Grace, are low in Comfort. As the tall Mountains have few flowers on them, or Mines of Gold little graſſe co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>To this Chriſtian Joy is required a knowledge of God, and faith in him, as revealed in the Word.</hi> As there cannot be any love or delight in what we know not; ſo neither any joy. The bruit beaſts have no joy properly, becauſe they have no knowledge; They have a naturall delight, but that is not truely joy. Infants may have grace, yet have no actuall joy; Therefore when <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt a babe in the womb, did leap for joy, it was extraordinary; and this is the reaſon why ignorant and carnal men are wholly deſtitute of all heavenly joy. They have no knowledge, no ſpiritual illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; ſo that as the blinde man cannot delight in pleaſant colours, nor the deaf man rejoyce in curious muſick, neither can the naturall man rejoyce in heavenly and holy Objects; for he knoweth no better, he is not acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with any other Comfort or Conſolation, but what is in the bowels of the creature.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>There is required a ſanctified and heavenly frame of heart.</hi> For ſuch as a man is, ſuch is his joy. The voluptuous man rejoyceth in his pleaſures, the intellectuall man doth ſo rejoyce in his ſtudies, and finding out of truth, that ſome have forgot their time of food, yea have not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to their lives, ſo great hath their joy been in ſuch contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Thus the people of God, being made new creatures, and made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of a Divine Nature, they now become to love and delight in thoſe Objects, which once they hated and abhorred; They finde all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations from the creatures contemptible in reſpect of God, concerning whom they ſay with <hi>David, The Lord is my portion, and whom have I in Heaven, but thee, and in earth, in compariſon of thee?</hi> The old Rule is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Simile gaudet ſimili</hi>; The heavenly heart delights in heavenly Objects. Heaven it ſelf, and all the Glory of it, do not, or cannot affect a wicked man, no more then fine flowers or pearles do a Swine: So that this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of rejoycing in God, is altogether impoſſible to an ignorant carnall man, they can no more in their ſouls thus be raiſed up to God then in their bodies they can flie in the air. As our vile earthly bodies muſt be made ſpirituall and immortall, ere they can be filled full of agility, and be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to meet the Lord in the air: So theſe ſouls of ours muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed and ſanctified, ere they can take any delight in that which is good.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>This Chriſtian Joy requireth ſome kinde of poſſeſſion, at leaſt in ſome degree of Chriſt, or thoſe good things we long for.</hi> Propriety and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion is requiſite to joy. To know of never ſo many excellencies, if a man have them not, it doth but increaſe his miſery. The famiſhed Lepers knew there was food enough abroad, but till they were repleniſhed, they could not rejoyce in it. What joy hath a poor man to hear of many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that are rich; the ſick man of many others in health? If they have not ſuch things in peculiar poſſeſſion, it advanceth them not at all. Hence full and compleated joy is onely in Heaven, becauſe there is full and compleat fruition of God; Then we are come to our journeyes end, we cannot goe further, or deſire more then we have: But in this life, our joy may be daily filling our hearts; There be many vacuities to be
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:65216:225"/>
filled up; There be many deſires ſtill to be ſatisfied; ſo that we are to grow in our joy, as well as in knowledge and in grace. But yet becauſe even in this life, God is the God of his people, and they are ſaid to have him, and to enjoy him; and ſo Chriſt is ſaid <hi>to dwell in their hearts</hi>; yea the Father and the Sonne are ſaid to be in them, to ſup with them, to take up their manſions with them, to dwell amongſt them. Hence it is that even in this life they may have unſpeakable joy. Therefore when the ſoul hath left the preſence of God, or is under many ſad and black tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations thereby, as we ſee ſometimes in <hi>David,</hi> and in the Church: Oh the anxieties, and perplexities that it is filled with! Therefore in the Devils there is no capacity of any joy: For although they have a ſelf-love, and though their wicked deſires be many times ſucceſſefull in tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pting of men, and deſtroying of their ſouls, yet they cannot rejoyce, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſtate of miſery they are in, cuts off all hopes from them: If therefore the godly would live joyfully, let them take heed of interrupting their commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God; ſee you do nothing to eclypſe this Sun; If God hide his face, all your comfort will preſently wither.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of this Joy above all worldly Joy.</note>In the next place, <hi>Conſider the tranſcendency and excellency of Chriſts Joy above all worldly joy.</hi> It cannot be denied, but that many wicked men ſpend their lives in jollity, they ſeem to be the onely merry men, and godlineſſe is decryed for Melancholy, for moping, and for that which will undo a man: But true joy in the Lord ſurpaſſeth all humane and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly joy.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, <hi>The ſoul can more intimately and fully receive it's object then the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy can.</hi> Bodily and worldly pleaſures are received in by the ſenſes, which are but narrow doors and gates of the ſoul; but the ſoul of a man, what it receiveth, it doth let in with greater abundance: Hence if the Object be finite, and a meer creature, it cannot fill the heart: the heart is too bigg for it, onely God is more then the heart can comprehend: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the pleaſures, and all the joy that any man can take, though he ſet himſelf to it, as <hi>Solomon</hi> did, yet are but like the joy of tickling, or ſcratching, comparatively to thoſe immenſe joyes and conſolations, which God vouchſafeth: Hence our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Your hearts ſhall rejoyce,</hi> John 16.22. This heavenly joy is like <hi>Eliſha</hi>'s oyl, that multiplieth exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ſtayeth not, till thy cruiſes fail to receive it.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, <hi>This heavenly Joy ſurpaſſeth worldly in the pure and unmixed Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of it.</hi> It's joy without ſorrow; It's honey without any gall, called <hi>The fruits of Gods Spirit,</hi> becauſe of the ſweetneſſe of it, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Perfect love caſts out fear,</hi> tormenting fear. Thus joy from Chriſt, and in him, expels dejections, troubles of heart. No ſooner doth this Sunne ariſe, but all black and noiſome vapours are diſpelled. Here is a joy that is like the Elementary fire they ſpeak of, pure and unmixed, here are no mixtures to debaſe it, or allay it: But as for thoſe worldly delights, it's as a mad man that teareth his own fleſh, and yet laugheth while he doth ſo; So thou eateſt and drinkeſt, and makeſt merry, while thou damneſt thy own ſoul.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, <hi>It ſurpaſſeth in dignity; for this Joy is in God himſelf, it is in the higheſt good that can be.</hi> There cannot be a greater cauſe or motive to rejoyce in; but as for the creatures, they are broken cyſterns, they are limited in their comforts, they have their vexations as well as their delights, but above all they are below man; He debaſeth himſelf, when he taketh delight in theſe ſublunary things; they were made for him, not he for them: It is as ridiculous, as if a man ſhould delight in childrens baby-clouts: Oh
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:65216:225"/>
do thou remember of whom thou art born, and thou wilt take the beſt things to rejoyce in.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, <hi>Heavenly Joy ſurpaſſeth in the certainty of it.</hi> The joy which God createth in the ſoul cannot be taken away by any, but God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; Though ſickneſſe come, though poverty come, though afflictions ariſe, yet all theſe cannot take away his joy, yea in death it ſelf many times he doth moſt abound and overflow, whereas all worldly joy under ſuch calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are turned into wounds, into howlings and tremblings, ſo that they know not what to do.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly, <hi>It ſurpaſſeth in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſality and Extent of it.</hi> Joy in God is all Joy, becauſe God is an Univerſall Good; There is no want, but he can fill it, no miſery, but he is a peculiar remedy to it, whereas the Creatures have their peculiar Joyes, Health is one Joy, Wealth another Joy, but no one Creature hath all Comforts in it.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Sixthly, <hi>It tranſcends in the Fulneſſe and Degrees of Joy. Solomon</hi> ſpeaks of worldly Comfort, <hi>That even in laughter the heart is ſad.</hi> Even <hi>Seneca</hi> could ſay, Think you of thoſe many that laugh, any one hath true Joy, <hi>Res ſevera eſt Gaudium.</hi> Digge to the bottome of the heart of theſe merry blades, and you will finde terrours and fears there.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>IN the next place Let us Conſider the <hi>Effects</hi> of this Chriſtian joy, and they are admirable.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>It doth dilate and enlarge the heart, ſo that the Soul rejoycing is far more capacious then otherwiſe it would be:</hi> Some have died they ſay for joy, becauſe of the too much dilating and diſperſing the ſpirits; The Saints glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in heaven enjoy more then ever they could here of God, becauſe their hearts are more widened and prepared, Our Souls are narrow and ſtreightned within us till joy doth extend them; A man of a joyful ſpirit is like a Veſſell of a broad mouth, that receiveth far more of God and Chriſt then a dejected unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving perſon, ſo that when we are commanded <hi>to ſet open the doors that the Prince of Glory may enter into us</hi>; It's joy that will thus prepare us; It's the complaint of many of Gods Children of their narrowneſſe and ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of heart, that they have no room for Chriſt; Fears, they fill the heart, Worldly cares they alſo fill, ſo that as men in a Conſumption complain of a ſtopping and ſtreightneſſe in their breaſt, they have much ado to fetch their winde; Thus do the Children of God, oh they have ſuch ſtoppings upon their hearts, that they have much ado to pray, or to do any heavenly duty; Now joy is an excellent opener, That removeth theſe ſinful obſtructions, ſo that this ſhould make thee endeavour after a joyful life, it will make thee dilate in all dimenſions of grace; Thou wilt be a Chriſtian of a higher pitch, or like <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niels</hi> Tree whoſe branches ſpread themſelves abroad exceedingly.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>This Joy makes a man active and ſerviceable to God,</hi> Neh. 8.10, <hi>The joy of the Lord is your ſtrength</hi>; Weak hands and feeble knees which are the Inſtruments of action and motion are attributed to fear as the cauſe of them; Thus on the contrary Joy makes ſtrong hands and firm knees; The Inceſtuous perſon when almoſt ſwallowed with ſorrow could no more vigorouſly ſerve God then a piece of wood, whoſe moiſture is not yet dried up, would be uſeful for build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Hence any ſervice done to God that is accompanied with dejections and ſorrow, hath a kinde of uncleaneſſe in it, as we have a notable expreſſion, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 9.4. <hi>Their Sacrifices ſhall be unto them as the Bread of mourners,</hi> all that eat thereof ſhall be polluted, <hi>Lev.</hi> 11.1. Perſons that mourned for others that were dead, were accounted unclean, and thus doth all ſinful ſorrow and dejection, it makes thy duty unclean, it polluteth thee, for God loveth not only a chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full giver, but chearfulneſſe in all duties, and therefore we reade of Gods ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere threatning for the neglect of this, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.47. One great cauſe of all thoſe heavy Curſes there mentioned, is becauſe they did not ſerve the Lord
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:65216:226"/>
with joy and gladneſſe of heart; Adde to this, <hi>Deut.</hi> 12.7, 12. as alſo <hi>Deut.</hi> 26.14. where the perſon offering Sacrifices was to make this Proteſtation, that he had not eat thereof in his mourning: If you ſay, God is of ſuch infinite purity and holineſſe, that I being full of infirmities have cauſe to tremble before him; We grant it, yet remember the Pſalmiſts Advice, <hi>Rejoyce with trembling,</hi> Pſal. 2. That is the fat of the Sacrifice; Oh then thou that complaineſt of thy dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, liſtleſneſſe and lukewarmneſſe in Gods Service, whoſe duties look like <hi>Pharaohs</hi> lean Kine, and though they ſwallow down many fat opportunities as theſe did the fat Kine, yet remain withered and ill-favoured ſtill; Conſider whether unbelief and ſinful dejections are not like Ivy to the Tree, or like rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenneſſe in the bones, ſo <hi>Solomon</hi> cals Sorrow. The bones which are the chief ſtrength of a man, if they have rottenneſſe in them, how weak muſt that man be? Conſider then whether thy want of heavenly joy be not the cauſe of the evil upon thee, whether that do not make thee a barren Wilderneſſe and a parched heath, whether thou hadſt not fulfilled all Relations and opportunities more fruitfully, if this Joy had been fulfilled in thee.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. <hi>Chriſts Joy fulfilled in the heart doth conſume and expell all carnall and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſinful joys</hi>: He that rejoyceth in the Lord cannot rejoyce in ſin, becauſe the Objects are clean contrary, no more then a man at the ſame time can with one eye look upward and with another downward; A body may as well be in two places at the ſame time as the ſoul be intenſly affected with two contrary Objects, ſo that if thou complaineſt of the proneneſſe of thy heart to rejoyce in earthly and worldly things; Know there is no ſuch medicine to cure this as heavenly joy, as they ſay, fire will drive out fire, ſo joy will expell joy, Joy in the Lord, Joy in the world, What made <hi>David</hi> profeſſe ſo much joy in God, but the heavenlineſſe of his heart, and this greater joy put out the leſſe: As the Sun-beams will the fire; Seeing therefore a man cannot live but he muſt have joy in ſomething, Do thou pray and endeavour that the joy of the Lord may take up thy heart, for when this Sun is in thy ſoul, the Starres cannot be ſeen; <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>At Gods right hand is fulneſſe of joy,</hi> Pſa. 16.11. If then the Soul have already fulneſſe, it doth not deſire any other Object; If a man have the Ocean, he wants not the ſtream; If a man have the Sun, he needeth not the Candle; Thus he that hath fulneſſe of joy in God, wanteth not the joy of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther creatures; Inſomuch that he who hath this heavenly joy may be ſaid to be in Heaven while he is here on earth; No life comes ſo near to that of the glorified Saints in heaven as an holy life accompanied with this joy; If there can be an heaven upon this Earth, this is it; This is the Mount of Transfigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration that changeth a mans heart and his countenance, that makes him ſay, <hi>It's good to be here</hi>; Oh what enemies are we to our ſelves; Thou makeſt thy houſe, thy chamber<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a priſon, yea, an hell by thy diſtruſtfull fears, when every place would be an heaven.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 4. <hi>This Joy of Chriſt will exceedingly wean a mans heart from the world, it will make him undervalue all theſe earthly things which the world ſo much admireth,</hi> Pſa. 4.7. <hi>Thou haſt put more gladneſſe in my heart, then in the time their Corn and Wine encreaſeth</hi>; If then the ſoul have more joy and gladneſſe in Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and in his favour, then in all earthly contentments whatſoever: no wonder if the heart he looſe from the one and fixed upon the other; As he that hath eaten honey findes an unſavoury taſte in other things compartively, or as he that hath ſtddfaſtly beheld the Sun, is ſo dazeled with the luſtre thereof, that he cannot ſee other inferiour Objects; Thus the heart that is once raviſhed with the ſweetneſſe and glory that is in God and Chriſt, knoweth not how to ſtoop to theſe inferiour fading joys; No man then ſets ſo looſe in heart from earthly Comforts as he that hath this heavenly joy; Every thing tempts him to his loſſe, Shall he loſe his fatneſs and ſweetneſſe by embracing the Creatures.</p>
            <p n="5">

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> 5. <hi>This Joy of Chriſt will facilitate all holy and religious actions</hi>; They will make us think the time ſhort, and grudge the work of God is ſo ſoon over; Your worldly joy is called paſtime, and thus is heavenly, upon a better account, When a man rejoyceth in the <hi>Sabbaths,</hi> and cals them a <hi>delight,</hi> then they do not as thoſe worldly wretches in the Prophet <hi>Amos,</hi> c. 8.5. ſay, <hi>when will the time be over that we may be buying and ſelling?</hi> There is nothing makes the duties of holineſſe ſo burthenſome to thee as want of joy, if they were matter of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light thou wouldſt with joy wiſh that the Sun would ſtand ſtill, be grieved to give over, <hi>Iſa</hi> 61.3. It's called <hi>the Oyle of Joy,</hi> as the Oyl makes the Wheel go ſpeedily or the yoke eaſie; ſo doth a joyfull heart; The voluptuous man, The worldly man thinks not the day or week long enough to enjoy his delights, much leſſe doth the godly man the time of enjoying of God; Hence Eternity doth not glut the Saints in heaven and make them weary of God.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>This Chriſtian Joy will bear up the heart above all afflictions and tribulations</hi>; Thus <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. They are <hi>to account it all joy when they fall into tribulation,</hi> and 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.8. he ſpeaketh of thoſe who for the preſent were in heavineſs through mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold temptations, yet at that time did greatly rejoyce, and that with joy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable and full of glory; They could glory over all their tribulations; This joy you heard is compared to Oyl, and that will alwaies keep us above the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: Oh how happy is it when thy Temptations do not devour thy joy, but thy joy takes away the ſting of thy Temptations; This made the Martyrs and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors finde thorns grapes, and thiſtles figs; Oh we think that it's impoſſible ever for ſuch weak and infirm wretches as we are to go through ſuch Tryals as the Godly have done, but if we had their joy it would be no more to us then it was to them.</p>
            <p n="7">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> 7. <hi>Joy as it is participated in this life encreaſeth more hungring and deſire after the object we deſire, to have more of it ſtill</hi>; Take any Object of delight which we do not perfectly enjoy, and oh how it quickens and ſtirs up the appetite to have more ſtill, for although perfect joy doth fully ſatiate the deſire, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh all thirſt, becauſe as <hi>Aquinas</hi> ſaith well, <hi>Gaudium ſe habet ad deſiderium, ſicut quies ad motum,</hi> and ſo when the ſtone is come to the center, it moveth no further, yet becauſe in this life we have not a perfect fruition of God, only have ſome bunches of the Grapes of <hi>Canaan,</hi> not <hi>Canaan</hi> it ſelf; Therefore the ſweetneſſe we have in God or Chriſt doth more ſtir up the deſire after God, as you ſee in <hi>David,</hi> thoſe inchoate enjoyments of God did make him reſtleſſe and impatient for further Communion with him; Hence <hi>David</hi> exhorteth to taſte how good God is, if once we had but an experimental ſweetneſſe of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of his love, we ſhould ſtill be breathing after him, as <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 119. <hi>My ſoul breaketh for the longing it hath to him at all times</hi>; But eſpecially the heavenly joy produceth this admirable effect ſo contrary to fleſh and bloud, that it makes a man look for the coming of Chriſt, and haſtening it in his prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and deſires, as that which will compleat his joy, Here ſorrow and joy will be mixed together, but there is pure and unmixed joy, and that to all Eternity; Oh what a wilderneſs, what a place of baniſhment is this world to ſuch a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered heart; This is the valley of Tears, and that is the mountain of joys.</p>
            <p>Now to all this may be Objected, <hi>That it cannot be a Chriſtians duty to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies rejoycing, for many times they lie under ſad Temptations, eſpecially there are times and ſeaſons when God cals to mourning; Is any man afflicted, let him pray? Is any merry, let him ſing Pſalms?</hi> And <hi>Solomon</hi> of old ſaid, <hi>There is a time to weep, and a time to laugh; David</hi> alſo ſaith, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 126.5. <hi>Such as ſow in tears ſhall reap in joy,</hi> which implieth a time of tears only. To this Conſider theſe things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It may not be denied but that there are ſome times wherein God doth in a peculiar manner call to the duty of mourning, faſting, and humiliation; Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that the Prophet <hi>Iſay</hi> complaineth that when God called to mourning,
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:65216:227"/>
they went to their mirth and jollities, <hi>Iſa</hi> 21.12. And thus when God ſhall plainly afflict thee for any ſins thou haſt committed, as <hi>David</hi> with the loſſe of his Childe for his Uncleaneſſe; In ſuch caſes it is our duty to be humbled and to mourn under his hand; <hi>But theſe humiliations and faſtings lie in the abſtinence of that natural and lawful joy we might take in the Creatures, not in ſpiritual Joy:</hi> In daies of humiliation it's a duty to rejoyce in the Lord, and ſuch joy will like fire melt and thaw the heart; This joy that is ſo uſeful muſt not be laid aſide; But then that joy in the Creatures which at another time would be lawfull, is in ſuch a ſeaſon ſinful; It's not lawful then to joy in Wives, in Children, in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward comforts, but to mourn before God, as thoſe who by their ſins have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the loſſe of all; So then there may be a time when this outward world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly though lawful joy is to be denied; and in this ſence <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>It's better to go to the houſe of mourning then of laughter,</hi> becauſe ſuch ſad objects may be ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified to ſpiritual meditations.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Conſider this, <hi>That ſpiritual Joy may then moſt abound, when that ſoul-humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation and godly mourning is put in practiſe</hi>; No grace of Gods Spirit is contrary to one another, The ſame ſpirit that worketh joy doth alſo prove the ſpirit of Supplication and mourning on his people; Now as joy and trembling may ſtand together, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 2. and joy and fear, <hi>Act.</hi> 9.31. So may godly ſorrow and joy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt together, ſo that it is never unlawful to rejoyce in God no more then to love or to beleeve in him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> of Inſtruction, <hi>To inform us of the great concernment of spiritual Joy,</hi> We may ſay it's the life and marrow of Religion, It's the Spurre and goad to all holineſſe; Therefore how deceived is the world that looketh for joy and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation ſome other way, Honours, Wealth, and Greatneſſe will afford thee no true ſolid joy, yea, all theſe things will turn to gravell and wormwood in thy belly; As the Manna that was preſerved for the Sabbath day did onely laſt, If any kept that which fell in one of the ſix daies above the Command, it turned to pollution immediatly, and thus it is here; Whatſoever Joy is treaſured up in reference to heaven, that will alwaies abide, it will never forſake thee, but what is only in reference to theſe earthly things, it will vaniſh; Oh then ſay, thy <hi>Beloved is the chiefeſt of ten thouſand</hi> above all other worldly Comforts what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever.</p>

            <p>IN this 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe our Saviour urgeth a ſpecial and powerfull reaſon, why God the Father ſhould in a peculiar manner keep them, which was hinted, <hi>verſ.</hi> 11. and that is, the worlds hatred of them: So that this Petition hath a great deal of equity and righteouſneſſe in it; They will be expoſed to the malice of the world, and that for thy cauſe, becauſe they have believed in thy Word.

            </p>
            <p>I ſhall take the Heads in their order. And</p>
            <p>Firſt, The <hi>Cauſe</hi> of their hatred in the world, in thoſe words, <hi>I have given them thy Word,</hi> where by the antecedent is neceſſarily meant the conſequent, for Chriſts giving or preaching the Word of God, unleſſe they received and obeyed it, was not enough to procure hatred; Therefore they are both expreſſed <hi>verſ.</hi> 8. Chriſts giving them, and their receiving of the Word. For the Phariſees, and many enemies to Chriſt, who were of the world, and the greateſt part of thoſe that did oppoſe, did yet hear. The Goſpel was tendered to them, though they made themſelves unworthy thereof. And thus when the Orthodox ſay, That the pure preaching of the Word, is a note of the Church: By that they underſtand alſo a viſible, external accepting of it, otherwiſe the Word may be preached to Barbarians and Heathen, who may hear, but ſcorn and reject the Goſpel, and therefore cannot be a Church.</p>
            <p>This then being ſuppoſed, we ſee the cauſe of the Apoſtles miſeries and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions in the world, not becauſe they were thieves, robbers, or ſeditious perſons. But becauſe they did imbrace the Doctrine of Chriſt, all the words of this reaſon are emphatical, <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>doth greatly enrage the wicked of the world.</hi> No other reaſon is here mentioned of the worlds hatred, but this. Who would think that the men preaching of ſo holy a Doctrine, and ſuch glad tidings of ſalvation, and men obeying it, not wronging, injuring, or troubling others, yet ſhould meet with ſo much oppoſition! But thus it hath been, and thus it will be. In <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s time, To be a Chriſtian, was to be a <hi>Publicus hoſtis</hi>; and though, as that acute Father pleaded, The Chriſtians were no <hi>Albinians,</hi> or <hi>Barutians,</hi> ſuch as embroyled the Civil Eſtate with warres, yet becauſe they were Chriſtians, this was enough. The very name was a crime, and this made ſo many Fathers make ſuch excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Apologies in their behalf. Of this oppoſition from the world, our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our informeth them, when he firſt gave them their Commiſſion to preach, <hi>They ſhould be hated of all men</hi>; Never any went about ſuch an unwelcome and unthankfull peece of ſervice, as they did; Therefore they were <hi>as ſheep amongst wolves</hi>; and whereas it might be thought, That the Apoſtles being men, though greatly aſſiſted by God, might miſcarry through ignorance, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderate paſſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We ſhall finde it befell even Chriſt himſelf, that he in his Miniſtry, though he wrought ſuch wonderfull miracles, that might aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them; yea though thoſe miracles were uſefull and profitable, not for cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity, yet what reproaches, what ſlanders did they caſt on him, calling him <hi>a wine-bibber, a friend to ſinners,</hi> yea an <hi>Impoſture,</hi> one that had a <hi>devil?</hi> and never ceaſed, till at laſt they put him to death in the moſt ſcornfull and reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full manner.</p>

But becauſe there could not be any commerce or communion between God, abſolutely conſidered, and man fallen, therefore the Lord Chriſt interpoſed and made peace; but that what he had merited and purchaſed, might effectually be applied to ſuch as ſhall be ſaved, among other inſtruments, he ſet up Officers in his Church, whoſe whole ſtudy and care, ſhould be to informe and reforme men. So that people do enjoy the Miniſters of God upon a two-fold ſpecial account.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Gods great and ſpecial love to them, That God hath taken care to ſend ſuch, is more then the creating of a world for you, or vouchſafing all the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral mercies you enjoy: Hence it's ſo often ſpoken of, 2 <hi>Chron. ult.</hi> and in other places, that God <hi>ſent his Prophets riſing up early.</hi> This is ſpoken as the great love of God to them.

How much would people complain under a drought, and want of Rain, if for many years together there ſhould not be ſo much as a Cloud ſeen; But the gracious heart would think, the removing of Chriſts Miniſters not onely the taking away of Clouds, but of the Sun and Stars in Heaven.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>God and Chriſt who are thus the cauſe of their Office, hath appointed them their worke, and endowed them with abilities thereunto.</hi> Their imployment is to publiſh the Word of God, which is two-fold,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The Word of the Law,</hi> to convince men of ſinne, to inform of duty, to make them ſenſible of their undone and damnable eſtate they are in. Thus they are firſt to be wiſe Phiſicians to detect and diſcover the diſeaſe, the danger and cauſe of it.</p>
            <p>Then ſecondly, <hi>There is the Word of the Goſpel,</hi> which are the glad tidings of Gods favour, and Reconciliation with thoſe that are humble and contrite be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him. This is to publiſh <hi>the acceptable year of Jubilee,</hi> to ſuch as were ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually indebted, and under the thraldome of Gods wrath. This is a work in it ſelf abſolutely neceſſary; for what doth a ſinner more want then theſe two things, the Law in it's uſe, and the Goſpel in it's uſe. Men in their temporal neceſſities reſpect the Phyſicians, the Lawyers; but ſoul neceſſities are not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended; And as the neceſſity of it is ſo cogent, ſo the dignity and excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is admirable.

What will not God ſuffer any to ſeek him in vain? and ſhall they ſuffer for him in vain? Beſides it would diſcourage all to ſtand for his Word, Should he forſake them, who would ſet out upon this ſpiritual Warre with the world upon his own charges?

This is to ſhine as ſtars in a dark night: Dogs may bark at the Moon, but that ſtayeth not its courſe; Go on in the midſt of all the reproaches of the world, Let thy holy life torment them, let them be in a rage that they have nothing juſtly to charge thee with, and then ſay with <hi>Jerome, I thank God that I am worthy to be one whom the world hateth</hi>; We know the worlds oppoſition engageth Gods protection, and the Lord will account all that is done againſt thee as done againſt his own Majeſty.</p>

            <head>SERMON LXXXII. Of Wicked mens hating the Godly, the Cauſes, Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, and Properties of it.</head>
            <epigraph>
               <bibl>JOH. 17.14.</bibl>
               <q>And the world hath hated them, becauſe they are not of the world.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THe next thing to be conſidered is the Argument it ſelf uſed by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour in this Petition, <hi>Keep them by thy ſpeciall protection,</hi> why? <hi>becauſe the world hateth them</hi>; And I ſhall take in the ſecond Cauſe into the Argument, <hi>Becauſe they are not of this world</hi>; For I have ſpoken alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy about theſe things, from <hi>verſ.</hi> 11. I ſhall adde what was not then menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned.</p>
            <p>In the Argument you may take notice of the <hi>Subject</hi> or perſons that do hate, and they are ſaid to be <hi>the world,</hi> that is, wicked men called the <hi>world,</hi> becauſe they are the greater part of it, and becauſe they retain the wicked inclination of the world minding only worldly things; Now though the world be many times, and it may be here taken for that Society of men that is Heatheniſh, and doth not beleeve in Chriſt, thus the Church and the world are oppoſed 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10. yet we may extend it further, even to ſuch as do outwardly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe Chriſt, but in works do deny him, as is more to be ſhewed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There is the <hi>act it ſelf, hate,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, The word is in the preterperfect tenſe, It hath hated them already, though they had not much tormented it by their preaching, but it would more hate them, when Chriſt was removed, and their preaching more univerſall; It comprehends all times, it hath, it doth, and it will hate them, and hatred you heard was worſe then anger, being more fixed and permanent? The cauſe of this is, becauſe <hi>They are not of the world,</hi> for as love is to its like, ſo hatred is to that which is unlike and contrary; In the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture ſome Learned men ſay to <hi>hate</hi> is ſometimes taken to <hi>love</hi> leſſe, not an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute hatred, but a reſpective love, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.24. <hi>He will love one, and hate the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> i. e. leſſe love, And for this end they bring that place, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.3. <hi>Jacob have I loved but Eſau have I hated,</hi> where they would expound <hi>hate</hi> of a leſſe love, but whatever may be ſaid of the former place, this latter will admit of no ſuch Expoſition, as the Context will eaſily evidence.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Scripture ſpeaks of a good hatred, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.15. <hi>That which I hate, I do</hi>; So we are commanded to <hi>hate</hi> our Father and Mother, to hate our own lives, <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.26. <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.25 for Chriſts ſake; <hi>David</hi> alſo ſaid, <hi>He hated them which hated God with a perfect hatred,</hi> i. e. a full complete hatred, he had no love at all to them, that is, in reſpect of their wickedneſſe and their incurable enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty againſt God, though in other reſpects he pitied and loved them.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, There is <hi>a wicked and evil hatred,</hi> of which the Text ſpeaks.</p>

godly</hi>; It hath been ſo of old, and will be ſo to the laſt wicked man that breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; No ſooner were there a wicked man and a godly, but this hatred broke out into all cruelty; <hi>Cain</hi> hated <hi>Abel,</hi> and why? <hi>becauſe his own works were nought and his brothers good,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.12. No leſſe will ſerve then the bloud of Sheep, ſuch cruell Wolves:</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Conſider,</note>To open this Doctrine Conſider theſe things,</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">I. That there is a twofold ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred.</note>Firſt, <hi>That there is a twofold hatred with the Schoolmen,</hi> One is called <hi>Odium inimicitiae,</hi> an hatred of enmity whereby a man wils evil to him, becauſe it's his evil; Even as <hi>amor amicitiae,</hi> a will of friendſhip wils the good to a perſon loved, becauſe it is his good.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There is another kinde of hatred which the ancient Schoolmen had no Name for it, but afterwards it was called <hi>Odium abominationis</hi> or <hi>offenſionis</hi>; When a man is offended at, and hateth ſuch an object that is evil, but not the perſon, yea, we may love him dearly; Thus the Childe hateth the death of his Father <hi>Odio abominationis,</hi> but loveth his Father, yea, becauſe he loveth him, therefore he hateth his death; Now that hatred whereby the world hateth godly men, is <hi>Odium inimicitiae,</hi> it comes from an inward irreconcilable diſpla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency to the godly, it's terminated upon their perſons, becauſe they are ſuch, and therefore they are ſaid to be of the devil, repreſenting his nature, and are the Seed of the Serpent, which hath an imbred enmity againſt man, ſo that though never ſo much evil ſhould befall the Godly; Their goods ſpoiled, their Names blaſted, yet as long as they live, and becauſe they ſtill are alive, the world will hate them.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">II. The Cauſes of it.</note>Secondly, <hi>The cauſe of their hatred may be reduced to two Heads:</hi> 1. <hi>The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety that is between the nature and actions of the Godly,</hi> So that they do not love any godly man, no nor ſuch as never had any commerce with them or medling with them; There is an <hi>Odium naturale,</hi> which ariſeth from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of things, Such an antipathy is often mentioned by Writers, the Serpent that is young though never hurt by any man, yet becauſe they know them of ſuch a ſtamp they cannot love them; It being natural, they cannot give any Reaſon, <hi>Hoc tantum poſſum dicere, non amo te</hi>: You do not love him, why did he ever weary you? Did he ever ſpeak to you? No, but yet he cannot love him, ſo that as love conſiſts in the conſonancy and conveniency of the good thing loved; Thus <hi>hatred</hi> is in the diſſonancy and contrariety of that to us which we hate.</p>
            <p>The 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> cauſe of hatred is <hi>Ignorance,</hi> when men know not that Excellency and worth which is in ſuch perſons, and the juſt cauſe of love, which if we did we ſhould quickly lay aſide our hatred, and truly in a great meaſure the world ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth becauſe of their ignorance; They know not what Godlineſſe is, nor what godly men are; They know not their lives, their aims, their ends, but judge of them as hypocrites, proud, and minding only ſelf-ends, and therefore their hatred encreaſeth; Thus the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>If they had known</hi> what Chriſt was, they would never have crucified him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.8. and ſo they are ſaid, <hi>to ſpeak evil of the things they know not,</hi> Jude 10. Doſt thou then rail and deride at god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men, It's thy blindeneſſe and folly, Thou knoweſt not their cloſe walking with God; Thou underſtandeſt not the heavenly priviledges they enjoy; Thou doſt not conceive of their humiliation for their infirmities, judging themſelves before God worſe then thou canſt judge them; Oh if thy eyes were open, thou wouldſt ſay, theſe are the Servants of the moſt high God; Oh that my latter end might be like one of theirs, and of ſuch men the world is not worthy.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">III. The effects of it.</note>Thirdly, Conſider <hi>the effects of this hatred,</hi> and that is in three ſteps and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>An inward willing of all evil</hi> that may hurt them, and that becauſe it is
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:65216:233"/>
evil To will a man ſome evil for his good may be lawfull, as when <hi>David</hi> praieth, <hi>Put them in fear O Lord, that they may know themſelves to be men,</hi> Pſa. 9.20. Thus the Church of God may pray for afflictions upon thoſe Enemies that are curable, That by their afflictions they may repent and be humbled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, but hatred hath not this goodneſſe: It wils evil becauſe it is evil, and for evils ſake; It rejoyceth in the evil that befalleth a godly man, as part of its own good and happineſſe; Thus it is with all wicked men, they rejoyce as if ſome great good had befallen them, when ſome great evil hath come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the godly.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Their hatred breaks out into all <hi>all hard, cenſorious, and uncharitable ſpeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,</hi> all ſlanders and contumelies, into <hi>cruell mockings,</hi> as the Apoſtle cals them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.36. The hatred in the heart will ſoon be ſeen in the tongue, as the diſeaſe within is diſcovered by the Tongue; The Apoſtle <hi>Jude v.</hi> 15. ſpeaks of one end of Chriſts coming, <hi>viz. to execute Judgement on men for all the hard ſpeeches which ungodly ſinners were guilty of; David</hi> ſpeaks of wicked mens tongues, that they were like <hi>Raſors</hi> and <hi>ſharp Swords,</hi> men that breathe Hell Fire every time they ſpeak, This is a fruit of their hatred,</p>
            <p>And Laſtly, It breaketh out into <hi>actions</hi> as that which conſummateth all their wickedneſſe; It was hatred killed all the holy Prophets, crucified Chriſt, and put to death ſo many Millions of Martyrs; Before this hatred no good man, no holy man could ſtand.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But you may ask, <hi>How can a man hate a good man whom he knoweth to be good, ſeeing it is ordinarily ſaid, No man can will evil becauſe it is evil</hi>; And to hate a good man becauſe he is good, implieth, <hi>That the will can refuſe and deteſt its proper Object.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Anſwer is, We are ſaid to hate godly men, as wicked men are ſaid to hate God: Now God as he is good and full of all lovelineſſe, ſo cannot be hated, but as he hath that which a wicked man looks upon as evil to himſelf, ſo he hateth him; Thus as God is a holy God, one that will not acquit a ſinner, that will render to every man according to his works, So the wicked hate God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In like manner the wicked man hateth a godly man, becauſe his Godlineſſe is that which is contrary to him, an evil to him? It diſcovers thy naughtineſſe, It reproveth and rebuketh thy Impiety, and upon this reaſon he hateth him, yet, the wicked man doth not only hate a Godly man, but all things that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to him, and every thing a godly man loveth he hateth, Godly Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the means of Grace, and all becauſe a Godly man loveth them; All Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and preaching he hateth, <hi>All godly Order and Government in the Church of God he hateth,</hi> becauſe theſe things are loved by a Godly man, As love loveth not only the perſon but all things that belong to him, ſo doth hatred the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
            <p>In the next place Conſider <hi>the Properties of this hatred.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">

            </p>
            <p>Hence our Saviour, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.20, 21. applieth that of <hi>David</hi> to all the godly, <hi>They have hated me without a cauſe</hi>: Indeed if you doe regard the contrariety of wicked men to what is holy, this is a neceſſary cauſe, but it's not a juſt cauſe, for this indeed deſerveth the clean contrary; Had the Phariſees a Cauſe to cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie Chriſt? Had the <hi>Galatians</hi> a Cauſe to become Enemies to <hi>Paul?</hi> Oh no, Thoſe thou hateſt ſhould be accounted of as Jewels by thee; Thoſe thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileſt and reproacheſt the delight of thy ſoul ſhould be to them; It is a cauſleſs hatred.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2, <hi>It is an univerſal hatred</hi>; For ſeeing he hateth a Godly man for his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, then he muſt needs hate it whereſoever he ſeeth it; Indeed ſome God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men either through the power and place they have, or for other Reaſons are not ſo ſubject to the effects of wicked mens hatred, but the heart is full of poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:65216:234"/>
and venome againſt the one as the other, for he cannot be a good man whom wicked men do not hate one way or other; <hi>Wo be to you when all men speak well of you</hi>; This hating of Godlineſſe is called <hi>hating of the Light,</hi> Joh. 3.19. Now all Light is offenſive to ſoar eyes; Thus the Godly man liveth, but he muſt have his portion: Be afraid if wicked men love thee as ſeeing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of God in thee, they think thee like one of themſelves, if I did my duty I ſhould be more oppoſed.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. It is an <hi>implacable irreconcilable Hatred,</hi> Gen. 3. There was at firſt an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity put between the devil and his Seed, and the Woman and her Seed: Though wicked men may ſometimes flatter and applaud, yet the ſting is ſtill in the heart; Safety and opportunity would quickly make them vent their poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; You ſee though <hi>Saul</hi> ſometimes melted to <hi>David,</hi> ſaying, <hi>O my Son Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, thou art more Righteous then I, I have ſinned,</hi> yet for all this <hi>David</hi> would nor tempt him, nor go home with him: The Sheep may not think the Wolf ever mindes good to her, Therefore our Saviours advice is good, but very ſtrange, <hi>Beware of men,</hi> Mat. 10.17. He ſaith not, Beware of Lions and Bears, or Serpents, but of men, as if theſe were worſe then all.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 4. <hi>It's a cruell hatred,</hi> who is able to reckon up the ſeveral kindes of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that wicked men have invented to excruciate the godly with; No death for Chriſt would ſatisfie the Jews but what was moſt ignominious and painful; <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. <hi>Some were ſawn aſunder,</hi> This was like that Command of <hi>Nero, Ita feri, ut ſe mori ſentiat</hi>; It's known to all that reade Eccleſiaſticall Hiſtory what ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite torments have been invented, that the Martyrs might not ſimply die, but die as many Deaths as they have parts of body.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But you will ask, <hi>Whether every godly man is thus hated,</hi> Though ſome may be, yet are all?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> It's the inward diſpoſition of all wicked men to hate thoſe that are godly, but then the effects of it may be reſtrained, ſometimes for fear, becauſe thoſe that are godly may be advanced to places of honour and power; Though even then all wicked men have not been able to refrain; <hi>David</hi> complaineth that <hi>Drunkards made Songs of him,</hi> and when he was in his afflicted condition, with what ſcorn and contempt did <hi>Shemei</hi> revile him? So that if we reſpect the habitual inclination of the heart, no godly man can be loved by a wicked man; though there may be an outward reſtraint; Again, ſometimes God may ſo work the hearts of wicked men, that for ſome time and in ſome exigences they may love the godly, and refreſh them; It's Gods promiſe that when our waies pleaſe God, <hi>even our enemies ſhall be friends with us,</hi> Prov. 16.7. What a ſtrange thing was that, that when the <hi>Iſraelite</hi> was ſo tranſcendently hated by the <hi>Egyptian,</hi> yet God ſhould give them ſuch favour that the <hi>Egyptians</hi> ſhould lend them their Gold and their Jewels, yea, while all that multitude went away, not ſo much as a dog to bark at them, ſo that though the ordinary Rule be for the Godly man to be hated, yet God may at ſome time preſerve ſome Godly men from the ſtrife of tongues, he can change <hi>Eſaus</hi> bloudy heart to melt towards <hi>Jacob,</hi> and he can command <hi>Laban</hi> to ſpeak kindely to him, thus he promiſed <hi>Iſrael,</hi> they ſhould finde mercy in the eyes of them who led them captive.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Though the world may hate godly men, yet it's not neceſſary that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry godly man ſhould be hated by every wicked man; Thoſe Godly men are moſt ſubject to hatred, who by their Office and Calling ſet themſelves moſt againſt vice; Therefore godly Magiſtrates and godly Miniſters are more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to hatred then private Chriſtians, for they are not called to controle ſin, and ſtop the current of it as publike Officers are; Therefore let all ſuch as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be godly in diſcharge of their truſt, not matter the hatred of wicked men, Lay that down for a foundation, for as the ſhadow will accompany the Sun, ſo will malice and backbiting the godly actions of holy men, yet ſome are
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:65216:234"/>
more hated then others: <hi>Obadiah</hi> could live in <hi>Ahabs</hi> Court for all <hi>Jezabels</hi> malice, when <hi>Eliſha's</hi> Life was greedily ſought for</p>
            <p>Therefore 3. In the hatred of the world God hath a ſpecial regard to his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, he laieth no more on them then they can bear; The ſtrong Chriſtian God calleth to more dangerous combats; All had not ſuch oppoſitions as <hi>Paul</hi> had, Some are like <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah,</hi> put in the forefront of the battel; <hi>The devil ſhall caſt ſome of you into priſon,</hi> Rev. 2.10. It's but ſome of them; Thus <hi>James</hi> was behead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and <hi>Peter</hi> was impriſoned, when the other Apoſtles were not touched; God doth wiſely order the affairs of this world, even wicked mens tongues and hands are bound up, and they are let looſe as God pleaſeth.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Even amongſt wicked men there is much difference, Some are farre more bitter and cruell then others, Some have more Conviction, Some have better Natures, Some are of a more noble diſpoſition, for although that Seed of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity be in all wicked men, yet in ſome it's more ſtifled or diverted then in others, when <hi>Herodias</hi> ſought the death of <hi>John Baptiſt, Herod</hi> for a long time preſerved him; Thus as all weeds have not the like noxiouſneſſe, ſo neither is every wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked man like to another; Every one is not a <hi>Cain,</hi> an <hi>Abſalom,</hi> a <hi>Nero,</hi> or a bloudy <hi>Bonner.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But then Laſtly, Take heed that if thou haſt not ſo much hatred of the world as other godly men have, that it be not for want of godlineſſe, becauſe thou art not ſo zealous againſt ſin, Thou art more complying with or conniving at the wickedneſſe of others; This is to buy the worlds good word at a dear rate, Thou hadſt better all the world ſpeak againſt thee then to have God and thy conſcience accuſe thee for not doing thy duty.</p>

            <head>SERMON LXXXIII. The Application of the fore-going Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, both to the Godly and the Wicked, tending to Encourage and Rejoyce the one under all their Sufferings, and Deterre and Reclaim the other from all their Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions.</head>

               <q>And the World hath hated them, becauſe they are not of the World.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THe Worlds hatred (you have heard) to be the godly mans Portion, The one are Sheep, the other Wolves. I now proceed to ſhew, What is the Duty of Chriſts Diſciples under the worlds hatred? For it's no mean skill to take the poyſon from theſe enemies, and to make wholſom medicines of it, as Phyſicians do about Vipers; yea, it's one of the great miracles that Chriſt hath enabled all believers to perform. For we reade, when an Heathen ſuprized a Chriſtian, and beat him with much cruelty, and with great ſcorn asking him, What great wonder his Maſter Chriſt ever did? The believer replies, even this great miracle, <hi>That though you uſe me thus cruelly, I can heartily forgive you.</hi> What then was ſpoken to the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples in an external, temporal manner, may be verified in a ſpiritual ſenſe, <hi>That they ſhall tread upon Serpents, and if they drink any deadly thing, it ſhall not hurt them.</hi>

               <note place="margin">The duty of Chriſts Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples under the worlds hatred.</note>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> And firſt, Do the ungodly men of the world ſhoot their arrows againſt thee, <hi>Let this make thee examine thy ſelf, Whether there be not ſome ſinne thou art guilty of, that hereby God would humble thee for?</hi> The Hebrews call an enemy an obſerver, becauſe his malice puts him upon a diligent obſerving of all thy wayes, and therefore if there be any wickedneſſe, any failing, to be ſure, he will reminde thee of it, which made the Heathen ſay, <hi>That he who would be good needeth either a faithfull friend, or a better enemy.</hi> It may be then, thoſe ſins, thoſe failings, that no friends, no Sermons meet with, thy enemy may inform thee of: So that thou mayeſt ſay, thy enemy hath been the beſt friend in the world, yea his railing words have done thee more good then many Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons; Not that they intend good, no more then the horſe-leech, but to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie their own luſts, only thou by heavenly wiſdome doſt turn their evil into good, but if ſo be that upon examination thou findeſt thy ſelf free; Yet</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> Secondly, <hi>Conſider, whether it be not for ſome other ſinnes, that ſuch men are made adverſaries againſt thee:</hi> For you muſt know, God hath a wiſe ordering
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:65216:235"/>
of all mens hearts and tongues, even in reference to thee; and as <hi>David</hi> when <hi>Shimei</hi> railed on him, ſaid, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. <hi>The Lord hath bid him,</hi> So whatſoever wicked men do concerning thee, thou muſt ſay, The Lord hath bid him. Now though <hi>David</hi> was not guilty of thoſe ſins <hi>Shimei</hi> reviled him with; neither did the Lord bring him in diſtreſſe for his quarrel with <hi>Saul,</hi> as <hi>Shimei</hi> thought, yet <hi>David</hi> had other ſins, and other tranſgreſſions, for which he might be afflicted, and ſo looked upon <hi>Shimei</hi> as a ſcourge to humble him for them. Therefore ſay, Though the things laid to my charge be falſe, yet there are other failings, other infirmities that the world knoweth not of, which God ſtrikes at by this mans tongue, or rather the devil in that man.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Do wicked men hate thee? Take our Saviours rule, ſo contrary to fleſh and blood, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.44. <hi>Love them that hate you, pray for them that perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute you</hi>; and in other places, <hi>Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good,</hi> Rom. 12.21. This is that peculiar leſſon, which the Chriſtian Religion only teacheth. Neither <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> or <hi>Tully</hi> thought it a duty, but rather a ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity not to be avenged upon enemies. But the Scripture is much in preſſing this duty, and that as a ſpecial ſign of grace, wherein we ſhall as children of God <hi>repreſent our heavenly Father, who makes the Sunne to ſhine upon the ungodly as well as the godly.</hi> All the wicked men of the world, they hate God as well as thee; and it's in his power to deſtroy them all, immediately in a moment to ſend them to hell; yet with what patience and loving kindneſs doth he bear ſuch ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, he gives them food, raiment, and manifold preſervations; ſo <hi>Chriſt even when we were enemies died for us,</hi> which the Scripture makes a forcible argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for us to <hi>forgive others,</hi> This is a kinde of perfection to do ſo, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. <hi>ult. Be ye perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect</hi>; He cals this patience and forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving diſpoſition a perfection; If then they rail, do thou bleſs; if they curſe, do thou pray, this is to <hi>pour living coals upon their head,</hi> as <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.10. which ſome underſtand in a good ſenſe, it will melt the man, as <hi>Saul</hi> was under <hi>Davids</hi> kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and as you ſee fire will at laſt melt iron, though never ſo tough; or others in an ill ſenſe, as if when thou haſt done thy duty, God will ſeverely puniſh them; This is the way to bring fire about their ears. Take heed therefore of private revengefull thoughts, theſe are unbeſeeming a Chriſtian, God makes this his Property, <hi>Vengeance is mine,</hi> Deut. 32.2. Although the Heathen could ſay, <hi>Revenge was ſweeter then honey</hi>; and ſo it is to a natural man, but it's farre ſweeter then honey to a gracious heart to be able to conquer his revengefull di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſition; private revenge is unlawfull, yet a ſeeking to the Magiſtrate for to puniſh offenders, or to obtain right, is a duty, onely take heed of revengefull thoughts in the purſuing of it.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Doth the world hate thee for Chriſts ſake?<note place="margin">Why the godly ſhould rejoyce when they are hated for Chriſts ſake.</note> 
               <hi>Then rejoyce and be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding glad,</hi> Mat. 5, 12. And that for ſeveral Reaſons,</p>
            <p n="1">1. As it followeth in that Text, <hi>Great is your reward in Heaven.</hi> The more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified and debaſed here, the more glorified and honoured in Heaven: So that wicked men, while they think to do thee a miſchief, they are inſtrumentall to thy great glory. They make thee more happy, and more glorious; It's as if a man ſhould be angry with another, and in ſtead of ſtones he throw precious pearls and diamonds at him, which the man takes up and enriches himſelf with; or as if a man threw bread at a dog, in ſtead of being hurt by it, he is glad of it, and takes it up, and eats it. Thus it is with wicked men, their reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, their ſlanders and oppoſitions make thee more refined and bleſſed; all theſe will be like ſo many crowns of glory ſet upon thy head: As the waters did not drown the Ark, but lifted it up nearer to Heaven.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Rejoyce, becauſe hereby God honours and puts a glory upon thee, that thou ſhouldſt be one who ſhalt be reproached and vilified for him.</hi> Admire the goodneſſe of God herein, and ſay with <hi>David, I will be more vile ſtill.</hi> Thus the Apoſtles
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:65216:236"/>
               <hi>went away rejoycing, they were accounted worthy to ſuffer for Chriſts Name,</hi> Act. 5.41. Phil. 1.29. It's ſaid <hi>to be Gods gift to ſuffer for him; To you it is given.</hi> It's a priviledge and an honour to loſe any thing for Chriſts ſake; as <hi>Nazianzen</hi> ſaid, He was glad he had ſomething to looſe for Chriſts ſake: And ſo zealous were the primitive Chriſtians of the glory of Martyrdom, that many were ſo dejected becauſe God called them not to it, that they needed conſolatory letters to ſatisfie them. Though the world look upon them as diſgraced and miſerable, yet God honours thee, and this thou art to judge of, as the greateſt mercy and dignity that ever befell thee.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Rejoyce, becauſe God and Chriſt will hereby be indeared unto thee, and give thee larger ſupplies and proviſions of comfort.</hi> Nihil crus ſentit in ligno, quando animus eſt in Coelo, <hi>I will be with thee in the fire and water,</hi> ſaith God. Was not <hi>Peter</hi> ſinging of <hi>Pſalms</hi> in the priſon: Oh then know this is the time of Gods peculiar love, of his more mercifull approaches to thee, thy winter will be thy ſummer, thy outward troubles will be accompanied with the moſt inward joyes. This is Gods way, when the world moſt ſlanders and accuſeth, to give the believer ſtrongeſt evidences of his Juſtification within. The godly were moſt enlarged in ſoul, when they were ſhut into ſtraighteſt priſon, and they had moſt of a bright glorious Heaven, when they were plunged into a dark dungeon, thy incomes will be rich, when thy expences ſhall be great, the more men frown, the more will God ſmile on thee.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Rejoyce, becauſe hereby is a conformity to Chriſt, and to all the holy men that have gone before thee.</hi> So in <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.12. Rejoyce, <hi>becauſe ſo perſecuted they th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> conformable unto Chriſt in theſe afflictions, they are an effect of Predeſtinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Theſe troubles and reproaches God from all eternity appointed thee unto, as by which he would glorifie thee. They came from that ſpring of the great love of God, which he had toward thee before thou hadſt any being; ſo that hereby thou art made like to Chriſt, a glorious Diſciple doth not beſeem a cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified Saviour; neither rich and adorned members become an head crowned with thorns; How many have gloried in being like ſome great and famous men in the world? How much rather is this an honour to be reproached as Chriſt was, to be ſlandered as Chriſt was, the Diſciple muſt not expect to be above his Maſter.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Rejoyce, as having an opportunity of the exerciſe and increaſe of grace.</hi> The horſe neigheth at the battel and war-like ſounds, as being glad of the occaſion. A valiant man delights in the occaſions of his activity. The Pilot ſheweth his skill in times of danger and tempeſts. Know therefore that when the world ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth thee, God then cals thee out to a ſpiritual combate, thou art then become a ſpectacle to God, he beholds what excellent graces thou wilt ſhew forth, what faith, what patience, what fortitude, what heavenly-mindedneſſe. Now if ever there is a time to ſhew thy ſpiritual might and courage, yea here is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an occaſion to put forth thy graces, but an opportunity to diſcover thy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned love to God and Chriſt, to own Chriſt, when all the people would make him a King is no trial, but to ſtand to him, when they cried <hi>away with him, Crucifie him</hi>; this is a good evidence, God will then ſay, Now I know thou loveſt me, when theſe many waters the world throweth on, are not able to quench it, though father hate, though friends hate, though all hate, yet this doth not diſcourage thee in thy love of God; What a comfortable evidence is this of thy true grace: Nay, in ſome ſenſe thou doſt exceed the Angels in doing Gods will, for though they be zealous and active in obedience to God, yet they meet not with oppoſitions in their ſervice. They are not ſubject unto the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches and contempts of wicked men of the world, and therefore in this thou art more then an Angel.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, <hi>Rejoyce, becauſe God might have left thee to be ſuch a malicious enemy to
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:65216:236"/>
godlineſs, as thou ſeeſt they are.</hi> Every time thou heareſt, what ſlanders, what malicious words the wicked of the world vent againſt thee: O bleſs God, and ſay, I might have been left to ſuch a ſpirit, I was ſuch a devil my ſelf once, I opened my mouth againſt ſuch as fear God, as well as he! Oh bleſſed be God that hath changed my blackmore-skin, that hath given me another heart! when <hi>Paul</hi> met with wretched adverſaries, that blaſphemed him and the Goſpel, he preached: No doubt but he reflected upon himſelf, I was ſuch a mad blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer once, I perſecuted the godly once, I delighted in cruel vexings of them heretofore; And now how great is Gods goodneſſe to me, that he hath had mercy on me; If thou bleſſeſt God that he made thee not a Serpent, a Toad, or that thou wert not a natural fool, or a mad man, How much rather, that he hath not given thee up to ſuch a vile malicious diſpoſition?</p>
            <p>The next thing is to give Cautions and Arguments of admonition to the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, who thus hate Chriſt and his Diſciples.<note place="margin">Cautions to the wicked.</note> And</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, <hi>Let them know it's a cauſleſs hatred, yea it's an hatred where the greateſt love and delight ſhould be.</hi> And that upon two grounds, For</p>
            <p n="1">1. They are ſuch who would bring them to everlaſting ſalvation, if they were not prejudiced, their exemplary life, is it not a light ſhining before you, that beholding their godly, holy and pure converſation, you may be thereby wone to glorifie God? The counſels, admonitions and ſpiritual help they would vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to thee, ſhould make thee prize them more then all outward comforts: Do ye love ſuch as can make you rich, preferre you to places of honour, ſupply your neceſſities? Oh how welcome ſhould ſuch be to you, that would give you many an helping lift to Heaven! Why then is thy hatred ſo cauſleſs? Is it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they deſire thy ſalvation? Is it becauſe they pray for thee, they mourn in ſecret, for ſo <hi>David</hi> profeſſed, <hi>Rivers of waters ranne down his eyes, becauſe men kept not Gods Law?</hi> Wert thou not a ſtone and adamant theſe things would turn thy heart towards him?</p>
            <p n="2">2. They are ſuch for whoſe ſake thou enjoyeſt many bleſſings: It's becauſe of them the ſhip thou art in, is not drowned; God keepeth up the world, in reference to them, therefore the hedges are kept, becauſe of the Corn in the ground; <hi>The innocent deliver the Iſland</hi>; for <hi>Lot</hi>'s ſake <hi>Sodom</hi> was ſpared a long ſeaſon. Theſe ſtand in the gap, when Gods overflowing tempeſt would carry all before it.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, <hi>Conſider that thou doſt not hurt them yea thou increaſeſt that which makes them ſo hatefull to thee.</hi> For by this means they walk more cloſely with God, they ſeparate themſelves from the world. It's a mercy to them, they have this hatred, otherwiſe they might comply too much, and enſnare their ſouls, and ſymbolize with mens wickedneſs: Now how abſurd is thy hatred, by that thou makeſt them more holy, and ſo advanceſt that which is ſo abominable to thee? Thou art to them as a fyle to the ruſty iron; thou art to them as <hi>Lazarus</hi> dogs tongues were to lick his ſores whole; thou art Gods ſcullion to wipe and keep his veſſel clean, who would not think thou ſhouldſt rather do, as that perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, that would not let him die, ſaying, he envied him the honour of a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr? Thy very hatred ſhould make thee leave hating and oppoſing, becauſe hereby thou makeſt the godly man more glorious and happy.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, <hi>Conſider hereby thou hurteſt thy ſelf, and not them</hi>; As the dog that bites the ſtone for rage, or a man that ſhoots an arrow at a brazen wall, and that recoileth back, and kils the Archer; thy hatred, thy curſings will fall back upon thy head; It's not the godly man only, but thy ſelf and thy own ſoul thou hateſt; See whether thoſe many curſes and miſeries thou haſt, be not the fruit of thy hatred, thou art a tormentor and troubler to thy ſelf; Though <hi>Achan</hi> troubled <hi>Iſrael,</hi> yet he troubled himſelf and his own houſe alſo.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, <hi>Remember that it's a deviliſh thing, thou art more wicked then a

man uſeth to be</hi>; Not to obey or yeeld thy ſelf up to godlineſſe is a grievous ſin, but to oppoſe is a deviliſh thing; Thou doſt the work of the devil if he were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate, he would ſpeak and do as thou doſt.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Remember the woful and heavy judgements which remarkably follow ſuch men,</hi> Who ever hardened himſelf againſt the Lord, and proſpered? This Chriſt meant when he ſaid, he that ſtumbled at this ſtone ſhould fall, but upon whom this ſtone ſhall fall, he ſhould be beaten in pieces; Chriſt will fall on ſuch that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe him, and they ſhall not have the leaſt mercy.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>THE Laſt particular conſiderable in this Verſe, is the exemplarity of Chriſt or the Diſciples conformity unto Chriſt, <hi>They are not of the world as I am not of the world</hi>; Which words are repeated in the 16. verſe, and therefore have ſome weighty and great matter contained in them.</p>
            <p>In the words we are to take notice,</p>
            <p n="1">1. What it is to be of the world.</p>
            <p n="2">2. How Chriſt was not.</p>
            <p n="3">3.The ſimilitude between Chriſt and his Diſciples herein. To be of the world, is to partake of the manners, life, and converſation of the world, to have the ſpirit of the world in a man,<note place="margin">What it is to be of the world.</note> and this is oppſite to the Spirit of God, and to all heavenly things, ſo that both the inward inclination, and outward converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is wholly worldly, as our Saviour ſaith, <hi>he that is of the earth, is earthy</hi>; That as bodies in whom the element of the Earth is predominant, doe naturally fall downward, ſo that ſoul which is thus principled and habituated in a worldly manner, doth minde only earthly things; this is to be of the world. To be in the world is another thing: Our Saviour and the Diſciples were in the world, but not of it: A man may be in the water for ſome good end, but the fiſh
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:65216:237"/>
are properly of the water becauſe that is their Element, and they have a watery Conſtitution.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Chriſt is ſaid <hi>Not to be of the world,</hi>
               <note place="margin">How Chriſt is ſaid not to be of the world.</note> Now that is a higher degree then the Diſciples can be, for Chriſt as God is no waies of the world, and then take him as man, yet being conceived by the holy Ghoſt he was not of the world in a natural way, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.47. <hi>The Second Adam is the Lord from Heaven,</hi> oppoſed to the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> who is ſaid to be of the Earth earthly.</p>
            <p>And then 3. If it be taken for the wickedneſſe of it, Then Chriſt was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo of the world, Therefore here is a difference between Chriſt and his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, for though they were not now of the world, yet once they were plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in ſinne, and corrupted through pollutions as others were, but Chriſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was of the world in this ſence,</p>

               </note> as Apoſtles, and ſo of all thoſe that have any Office and Miniſtry in the Church of God. Theſe are as neceſſary as the Sunne to the world, as the Starres in a dark night, as ſalt to ſeaſon and preſerve from putrefaction, and even all believers in a private way are to uſe their gifts for the reducing of others; and by their examples to give ſuch a glorious light, that others may glorifie God in the day of their viſitation, but this doth prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally relate to them, as Apoſtles, had they been immediately carried up to Heaven, where would have been the <hi>leaven</hi> put into the three pecks of meal? Where the <hi>muſtard-ſeed</hi> ſown, that would grow up into a great Tree? If the Apoſtles were the Planters and Founders of the Church, it was neceſſary that they ſhould continue for ſome time in the world; The world was a wilderneſſe, that could not immediately be made a garden; It was the Devils habitation, he could not ſuddenly be diſpoſſeſt: So that God having ſervice for his people to do, no wonder if they muſt continue in this valley of miſery. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to this <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.14. <hi>To abide in the fleſh is neceſſary for you, but for him it was better to be diſſolved, and to be with Christ</hi>; and between theſe two, he was in a great ſtraight: So certainly, it were better for the people of God, eſpecially for the Miniſters of the Goſpel, who are like <hi>

This then is the firſt reaſon Gods people have work to do, a courſe to finiſh, and ſo they muſt not look to have wages before they have laboured in the Vineyard.</p>

Juſtification is of the <hi>believer,</hi> but a <hi>ſinner,</hi> and one that is not able to ſtand upon his own terms before God. Therefore Chriſt is his righteouſneſs, and he deſireth with <hi>Paul to be found in him</hi> (Phil. 3.) <hi>not having his own righteouſneſs</hi>; ſo then Goſpel-righteouſneſs, and our evangelical Juſtification differs from that in Heaven, which will be for inherent righteouſneſſe, but it hath pleaſed God in this life to exalt imputed righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and to place the cauſe of all hope and joy without us: Therefore that we might for a ſeaſon be ſenſible of our unworthineſſe, and be groaning under our corruptions, thereby to be longing after Chriſt, to magnifie his love, and all that he hath done for us, it's neceſſary we ſhould be kept in this conflict here below, for we are much affected by ſenſe and experience; when therefore every thing within us crieth out for a Chriſt, and the grace of God through him, when we feel our ſelves ſinking, and even dropping into hell; This will make us importune for the favour of God, as Chriſt was experimentally <hi>tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> that he might know how to have <hi>compaſſion on us,</hi> ſo God will have us expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimentally finde the bitterneſs and weight of ſin, that ſo we may the more love Chriſt, who did bear Gods wrath for us.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, <hi>God will not take his people immediately out of the world, that ſo his goodneſſe, mercy and providence, his wiſdome and faithfulneſſe may be the more diſcovered to us.</hi> In Heaven there the Church is at reſt, it's out of all danger, there are no waves, no rocks: So that the Wiſdome and Providence of God in keeping his Church there, is not at all diſcovered; When the waters were dried up, there was no neceſſity of an Ark for <hi>Noah.</hi> The Lord therefore will have us in theſe dangers and temptations, that ſo his care and love may be the more manifeſted; yea the greater the dangers are, the more is his faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe diſcovered, <hi>In the Mount God will be ſeen.</hi> Is it not an admirable thing to conſider how God hath preſerved a Church, a people faithfully to ſerve him, when hell and the world hath conſpired to deſtroy them? But God by this means hath been made known to the world. The Artificers skill is ſeen about his metal, when it is in the fire. The Pilates art is manifeſted, when his Ship is on rocks and waves, and under many tempeſts. Though the world be a place of our dangers and temptations, yet it's the glaſſe to repreſent the glorious Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes of God, and the effects thereof to his children, where God is known not only by <hi>Adonai,</hi> but by <hi>Jehovah,</hi> even by every name.</p>

The Scripture cals Heaven a reſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. <hi>There remaineth a Reſt for the people of God.</hi> Oh how welcome will it be after all the troubles, calam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

God therefore will have thee lie under all kinde of conflicts, ſpiritual and temporal; he will create one exerciſe after another, that thou mayeſt ſay, <hi>We have no abiding place here.</hi> Should all things be according to our carnal deſires, we would with the <hi>Reube<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites</hi> take up on this ſide <hi>Canaan,</hi> becauſe the ground was pleaſant and rich; Never did thoſe endangered paſſengers in <hi>Paul</hi>'s Ship deſire more to get to the haven out of all their dangers, then we are out of all theſe troubles into Heaven.</p>

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Seventhly, <hi>God doth not remove His immediately out of the world, becauſe of the dependencies and relations that They have.</hi> Children need their godly Father, the wife her godly husband: So that although it be better for them to be in Heaven, yet not for theirs.

It is true, God in his wiſdome many times takes his own children betimes out of the world, even too ſoon for them (we would think) being in the prime of their ſervice, and too ſoon alſo for their children and dependents on them, but therein God is even mercifull, though for the preſent we do not perceive it.

God doth every thing beautifull in his ſeaſon. None could be more loved of the Father, then Chriſt himſelf, he came from the boſome of his Father, yet till he had finiſhed his courſe, he is kept from him; We ſay, even the beſt and holieſt thoughts, or deſires may come in unſeaſonably into our hearts, and ſo not be beſt at that time. As the childs duty is not to learn the beſt book at firſt, but what he is moſt capable of; Though Heaven and glory be beſt, yet not at this time for thee partake of it.

               </gap>, that cannot be the devil, for we are commanded to <hi>reſist</hi> him, but we may take the word generally both for ſinne and the devil, and ſinful perſons, That the ſence may be thus, Though I pray not that thou ſhould keep them free from all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and afflictions, yet I pray that they may be preſerved from ſinne thereby, that whatſoever may befall them, yet they may not ſinne, and here we ſee alſo that it's Gods gift to keep men in their afflictions that they ſin not; Otherwiſe they would undo themſelves, and through many tribulations they would go not into the Kingdom of Heaven, but of hell, from miſery here to miſery here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
            <p>Obſ. <hi>That it's a greater mercy to be kept from ſinne and all evil in our Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Troubles,</hi>

               <hi>then from the afflictions themſelves</hi>; This is a ſpeciall Truth, for whoſe heart is not troubled about the Affliction more then the Sinne? Whoſe heart is not more upon the paſſive evil he ſuffers, then the active evil he doth? Whoſe ſoul is made ſo ſpiritual that no vexation, or pain and loſſe in body or Eſtate doth affect him ſo greatly, as the ſinful diſtempers and troubles of his ſoul doth.</p>
            <p>But to open this Conſider,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That it's Gods ſpecial Gift and his power only that keeps his people from ſinne in their afflictions</hi>: For did not God ſanctifie, Did not God teach as well as chaſten, the Evil of Sinne and the Evil of Puniſhment would alwaies go toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the time of our trouble, and the time of our tranſgreſſions would never

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed with the more they ſtink: As the damned in hell, their Torments make them rage and blaſpheme againſt God, Thus it is with the wicked on the Earth, their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent troubles draw out their corruptions; They are more impatient, more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented, and never more evil then when they have the greateſt cauſe to be exceeding good; But to the Godly it is otherwiſe, that light which burneth the wicked enliveneth the Godly, as the fire in <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> Furnace did loſe the bonds that the Worthies were bound in, and made them at Liberty, when it conſumed the ungodly; Thus Afflictions many times ſet the Godly at Liberty from their ſinnes, looſe their hearts more from the world, but how comes this about, it's the meer Gift of God, Did not God ſupport, as Chriſt did <hi>Peter,</hi> in theſe waves, we would preſently be over-whelmed; Oh then reflect on thy ſelf, Hath any trouble? Have any Afflictions made thee more humble and more upright? Hath Beleeving outed thee from the world and earthly things, know that it's God that hath kept thee from the evil.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, <hi>The Scripture ſpeaks of it as a ſpecial favour, when God will be with us in our Afflictions, ſo that we ſhall not be left to Temptations</hi>; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are conſtantly to pray, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.13. that God would deliver us from Temptation; Now although proſperity and outward mercies are a Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet the Scripture doth for the moſt part call Afflictions only Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, becauſe we are ſo hardly able to keep our Integrity and holineſſe in them, We can hardly overcome fleſh and bloud, or conquer our ſelfiſh Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſo, as to lie humbly and with deep Reſignation into Gods hand: Oh then what great thoughts of heart ſhould there be that ſuch a Condition, ſuch a ſtreight, ſuch an Affliction be not a Temptation to thee, that God do not leave thee in it; It's a ſpecial mercy to be kept from a Temptation but a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in it; This is miraculous like thoſe that were in the fire, and yet not burnt. There is not a more comfortable evidence of Gods love when thou ſhal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>be brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and broken with many afflictions, and yet they are not able to ſtir up cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions in thy heart; Never forget to pray, That as Temptations and Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions ſhall come on thee, ſo Gods ſutable Grace and tender Preſervation may accompany thee; Though Chriſt prayed thus for the Apoſtles to be kept from the evil, yet <hi>Peter</hi> gradually though not totally or finally was left by God in his Temptation, when he was ſurpriſed with fear, how grievouſly doth he deny Chriſt with bitter curſes and ſwearings? Here <hi>Peter</hi> was not quite from evil, though ſo farre as Chriſt prai'd for him, he was preſerved, <hi>viz.</hi> that his faith might not fail; Oh by this ſad inſtance we ſee if God withdraw his Arm from us how dreadful our Eſtate would be; That thou haſt not blaſphemed God and his Providence, and charged God fooliſhly in thy ſtreights, bleſſe and praiſe God for it, and remember that ſelf confidence is the great ſinne to provoke God to leave thee to the evil of temptations, as we ſee in <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Hezekiah</hi>; Take heed of going out of Gods arms, of letting go his hand or provoking him any way.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, <hi>Afflictions and Tribulations do not of themſelves make us holy, but they work according to the ſubject exerciſed with them</hi>; Indeed naturally to every man unregenerate they draw out corruption and ſinne, and Phyſick to an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable diſeaſe, doth but haſten Death, and fire to wood, and ſuch like Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtibles, doth not refine but conſume; The more a muddied Pool is ſtirred, the more noiſome it is, and thus it would work even in a godly man, did not
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:65216:243"/>
grace live within him as well as ſinne: Yet even to a godly man it's a very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult thing not to have the waves of his heart riſe high when theſe windes and tempeſts have blown upon them, and for this reaſon it is, that the more trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles are upon us, the greater aſſiſtance and diſcoveries of grace we need, and therefore there is more comfort in this praier of Chriſt then the heart can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive; Here is a proviſion made for thee in that which thou doſt moſt want, for if the leaſt temptation, the leaſt Evil fall on thee, if that fall upon thy heart it will preſſe thee to hell, ſhould not God ſupport and ſanctifie it, a gnat will choak thee as well as a Camel, God only moveth on theſe deeps, and makes them fruitful.</p>
            <p>In the next place Let us conſider the Grounds and Reaſons, why it's more bleſſed to have preſervation from ſin the evil of an affliction, then from the affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> And Firſt, <hi>Becauſe an Affliction is but a particular temporall Evil, but Sinne is an infinite, univerſall Evil:</hi> Sickneſſe depriveth of Health, Poverty of Wealth, and thus every Streight doth but oppoſe ſome tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall particular Good, that is the Creatures Good; But Sinne is an Univerſall Evil, it depriveth of God, and it diveſteth of all Glory and Happineſſe, ſo that as <hi>Anſelme</hi> ſaid, It ought to be our Reſolution, That if Hell were on one ſide, and Sinne on the other, we ought rather to chooſe Hell-Torments then Sinne, and the Reaſon is becauſe Sinne is an Offence and a Diſhonour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God; God is infinitely more then the Creature, and his Glory and Honour is more worthy then all we are: It's better the whole World ſhould be annihilated, and deſtroyed, and come to nothing in all its Comforts then that the leaſt glimpſe of the Glory of God ſhould be Eclipſed: Oh then whoſoever had rather ſinne then be afflicted, he preferreth himſelf above God, he preferreth himſelf above Chriſt, and he ſets up his own particular Safety and Security above Gods Glory: Oh then that we could be more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of Sinne then we are of Troubles; This is but the deprivation of ſome li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited comfort or particular advantage, but ſinne depriveth of God the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of all comfort.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, It's made an Argument of an Hypocrite and an inſincere heart, to chooſe Sinne rather then Affliction; To be affected with thy miſeries and Troubles, earneſtly deſiring the removing of them rather then the ſanctifying of them, <hi>Job</hi> 36.21, <hi>Elihu</hi> though he erred in the Application, yet in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall urgeth this as a Signe of one not rightly conſtituted to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, when he bids him <hi>Take heed,</hi> becauſe he had choſen Iniquity rather then affliction; We ſee the ordinary diſcovery of Hypocrites is to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any ſinne that they may avoid trouble; Thus <hi>Matth.</hi> 15. The temporary Beleever he withereth when the Sunne ariſeth to ſcorch: This hath been the great Cauſe of the Apoſtacy of ſo many Thouſands when the Evil Day hath come upon them, They have not been able to be vilified and reproached and abhorred for Chriſt, and therefore are there ſo many Exhortations to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere, and to overcome, to hold out to the laſt, ſo that thou canſt not diſcover the rottenneſſe, and the guile and deceit of thy Heart more then by being willing to commit any ſinne, to avoid thy immanent Dangers, and therefore what <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> mercy is it when God ſhall ſo ſanctifie thy heart that in theſe waters of Afflictions thou canſt ſee a full manifeſtation of thy Graces; In them thou doſt perceive how upright and ſincere thy Soul is to God, That all thy fear is, thou maiſt not offend or diſpleaſe God, Thou doſt not ſo much think of thy own grief and pain as that thou ſhouldſt do any thing to grieve the Spirit of God.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, It's a bleſſed thing to be kept from the evil of Affliction though not from the affliction, <hi>Becauſe then we may have the Preſence of God,</hi> and the
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:65216:243"/>
comfortable enjoyment of him; Whereas if we ſinne in them, we are every waies miſerable, we have no comfort within, and God will give no Comfort without; The Scripture ſpeaks of many precious promiſes to the godly in their Troubles, that <hi>He will be with them,</hi> that he will <hi>never forſake them,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that <hi>as their Tribulations abound, ſo the Conſolations of God abound much more,</hi> 2 Cor. 1.3 Now all this is while we are holy and heavenly in afflictions; The beſt part of our life may be that which was in outward exerciſes, <hi>David</hi> never had more of God, neither did his Faith and Holineſſe more abound then when toſſed up and down with Troubles: But oh how ſad is it when thou ſhalt by thy Unbelief, diſtruſt, and other ſinful waies offend God, that now thou haſt no Comfort within, nor any from God, who is the God of all Conſolation! It's ſinne only is the ſting of an affliction, God and ſinne will not be together, but God and Afflictions are often together: No marvell then if thou art thus to fear ſinne more then any trouble, becauſe trouble is not trouble, if ſinne be abſent, a gracious heart in afflictions hath an Heaven within, though it may have an hell without.</p>

It's happy to be kept from ſinne in Affliction, <hi>becauſe Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are for this End to remove ſinne,</hi> to ſubdue corruption, and to mortifie luſts; Thus they are ſaid to work <hi>the bleſſed fruit of Righteouſneſſe,</hi> Heb. 12.11. <hi>though for a time they ſeem grievous</hi>; And God ſaith, <hi>It's the fruit of</hi> Jacobs <hi>Trouble to purge away his ſinne,</hi> Iſa. 27.9. Now then, If Afflictions and Chaſtiſements be for this end to conquer ſinne, to make thee more holy, Wo be unto thee if they encreaſe and multiply ſinne in thee; Think with thy ſelf, God layeth theſe loads upon me to kill my pride, my worldly-mindedneſſe, to quicken me up againſt deadneſſe and dulneſſe: Now how ſhall I ever behold God if the clean contrary be found in me, If Unbelief and Frowardneſſe do over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come me: Do not then ſo much matter Affliction as Sinne, for Afflictions may be ſanctified to thee; They may be made happy Inſtruments of Grace and Holineſſe to thy Soul, but if ſinne be drawn out, then the end of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons is loſt, and how ſhalt thou be helped when that which is to cure thee ſhall augment thy diſeaſe.</p>

            <p>THough we have gathered the full vintage of this Text, yet there remain ſome gleanings, of which we may ſay with the Prophet, <hi>a bleſſing is in it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Two remarkable truths there are implied, the firſt in the <hi>Negative,</hi> the ſecond in the <hi>Poſitive</hi> part. In the firſt, in the <hi>Negative, I pray not that thou ſhouldſt take them out of the world.</hi> We may obſerve,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That God hath the dominion and immediate diſpoſing of our being and continuance in this world.</hi> When his day is come, when his Decree is expired,<note place="margin">

This truth is the more to be regarded, becauſe it hath been doctrinally agitated by learned men, <hi>Whether there be an immovable term of life in this world prefixed to every man?</hi> and then practically it is of great concernment, as is to be ſhewed.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> But to explain this truth, conſider, Firſt,<note place="margin">Propoſitions explaining this truth.</note> 
               <hi>That God hath not onely determined a general or ſpecifical time for all in the world, but an individual and peculiar for every man or woman, a general term of life God hath provided, ſo that none ſhall live beyond it.</hi> No man ever lived a thouſand years. In the beginning of the world, then men were longer lived, but in <hi>Moſes</hi> his time, we ſee him affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ordinary bounds of a mans life to be threeſcore and ten, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 90. For in the wilderneſs by their wickedneſs, they brought ſhort dayes upon themſelves: So that all creatures have a general term of life. There is the <hi>maximum quod ſic,</hi> though ſome live longer then others. Thus men have bounds in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, they cannot out-live. But this is not enough, God hath appointed to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry individual man, his continuance in the world, ſo that it is God that taketh him out of the world, when his time cometh.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> 2. <hi>Though God hath thus appointed our continuance in the world, ſo that in reſpect of his providence, none could live longer or ſhorter, yet if we reſpect ſecond cauſes, and ſpeak according to them, ſo we may truly ſay, ſuch might have continued long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in the world.</hi> Hence wicked men are ſaid, <hi>not to live out half their dayes</hi>; and <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Be not over-wicked,</hi> Eccleſ. 7.17. <hi>Why ſhouldſt thou die before thy time?</hi> Wicked men many times by their wickedneſs, drunkennes and uncleanneſs kill themſelves, and ſometimes provoke God to deſtroy them. But though they are ſaid not to live out half their dayes, yet that is to be underſtood in reſpect of <hi>ſecond cauſes,</hi> not <hi>Gods appointment</hi>; for ſo it was their whole dayes.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> 3. <hi>Though God hath appointed the times of our abode or removal out of the world, yet this decree and appointment is brought about in the uſe of means.</hi> We are not to apprehend ſuch a decree in God, that we ſhall live ſuch a time, let us do what we will, eat or not, it's no matter for the uſe of the means. This is wretchedly to diſhonour God; for though Gods will doth not uncertainly depend upon thy will, yet his appointment is with great ſweetneſs and condeſcention to ſecond
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:65216:245"/>
cauſes, both natural and rational, ſo that they are moved by him according to their natures. Therefore when <hi>Paul</hi> had a revelation, <hi>That none in the ſhip with him ſhould periſh,</hi> yet he tels them, that unleſs they continued in the ſhip with him, they ſhould periſh, <hi>Act.</hi> 27.31.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/> 4. <hi>Therefore though God hath appointed the bounds of our life in this world, yet he hath kept it ſecret from us, he lets none know</hi> (unleſs by ſpecial revelation) <hi>the times of their death.</hi> And therefore there is a duty impoſed upon all, that they uſe the means of life, <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill,</hi> reacheth firſt to a mans ſelf, and then to another: Hence to live chearfully, to uſe the help of the Phyſician are duties; Chriſt ſaid, <hi>The ſick need the Phyſician,</hi> Mat. 9.12. <hi>as for ſecret things they belong to God.</hi> The ſouldier knoweth not, whether he ſhall conquer ſuch an enemy, ſcale ſuch a wall, yet becauſe his General commands him, he is ready to obey, and thus though we cannot tell, ſuch means ſhall prolong our lives in the world, yet Gods will cannot be neglected without great ſin.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/> 5. <hi>God hath determined the time of our being in the world, out of juſtice and wrath to the wicked, out of mercy and wiſdom to the godly.</hi> It's anger to the wicked, for all the while they live, they increaſe their ſin, they treaſure up wrath; ſo that it had been well for them, if they had been cut off by death long before. They live to make hell the hotter for them, when they die. But to the godly the time of their abode is limited in mercy. <hi>The righteous is taken away from the evil to come,</hi> Iſa. 57.1. The ſhepherd driveth his ſheep to a refuge, before the ſtorm ariſeth. The jewels are ſafely put up, when the houſe is in danger; when <hi>Simeon</hi> had ſeen and imbraced Chriſt, then he had liberty to depart. The word is uſed in Scripture ſometimes of thoſe that are <hi>diſmiſſed</hi> out of priſon, or are <hi>diſpatched,</hi> when their errand is done, or <hi>freed</hi> from a <hi>flux,</hi> or ſuch diſeaſe that is upon them; and certainly, in theſe reſpects it may be applied, when God taketh his out of the world, it's becauſe they have finiſhed this work, and death freeth them from this world that was like a priſon to them, yea and now a ſtop is put to all thoſe luſts, that were like a bloody flux running from them; ſo that the time when God takes his out of the world, is from much wiſdom and great mercy: They ſhall not go ſooner, nor yet later then he willeth; and thus many times they are like that happy man, <hi>Cui ſine laſſitudine peractum eſt iter.</hi>

               </note>Now that it is God that continueth and takes out of the world, appointing every one their ſet time appeareth by evident Texts of Scripture, <hi>Job</hi> 14.5. where a mans dayes in particular, are ſaid to be determined, <hi>the number of his moneths,</hi> and his bounds beyond which he cannot paſs; he ſpeaks here of every man in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular; it is not worth while to anſwer the cavils againſt this place. So that as God hath appointed <hi>a ſet time for governments,</hi> and when that period is come, then all the world cannot hinder a change, as <hi>Dan.</hi> 5.25. <hi>God hath numbred thy kingdom, and given it away.</hi> Thus he doth alſo to every particular perſon. Not that men may neglect means, or do what they liſt, but he hath ordained this in and by the uſe of the means. Thus <hi>Act.</hi> 17.26.

Thus <hi>Act.</hi> 17.28. <hi>In him we live and move, and have our being.</hi> Thus we could not ſtir the foot, nor move the tongue did not God inable us; conſervation is a daily creation. Hence <hi>Daniel</hi> tels that great <hi>Belteſhazzar,</hi> though a mighty Monarch, <hi>Dan.</hi> 5.23. <hi>that he did not glorifie God, in whoſe hand his breath was</hi>; If God do but blow upon the richeſt, greateſt and healthfulleſt man that is, he is immediately ſcattered, as when we blow upon a little duſt; yea neither food would nouriſh us, or the creatures afford any ſuſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance did not God give a bleſſing to them, as you may ſee <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.25. <hi>He will bleſs thy bread, and thy water, and take away thy infirmities from thee.</hi> Thus when

the pillars of the houſe are removed, that muſt preſently fall into rubbiſh, ſo when God takes away his arm man runneth into nothing; and be <hi>David</hi> be, even to admiration, ſo affected with Gods providence in his conſtitution, ſhall not the ſame care be ſhewed to his diſſolution? <hi>Pſ</hi> 139.16. he ſpeaks there <hi>how curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly his body was wrought,</hi> even like any tapeſtry or needle work, and that all his members were in Gods book. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>There is a time to be born, and a time to die.</hi> But as the one is from Gods appointment, ſo muſt the other be.</p>

But if you underſtand it, as ſome learned men do in this ſenſe, <hi>To God belongs the goings out to death,</hi> then it's more plain, and indeed this is more conſonant to the text, for the Prepoſition <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thus you ſee, to God belongs the whole di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſing of us, the continuing or taking us out of the world.

Thus it is with all men, they have their hour: Even thoſe that by the greateſt hap come to their death, are yet ſaid to be delivered to it by God himſelf, <hi>Exod.</hi> 21.13. <hi>cum Deu.</hi> 19.4, 5, 6. If a man cutting of wood have the head of his hatchet flie off, and kill another, God there ſaith, <hi>He delivered that man into his hand.</hi>

Thou haſt thy day of death appointed, thy hour of diſſolution is coming, it's thy day. Now thou haſt a day of jollity, of mirth and quietnes, but remember this thy day is coming.

            </epigraph>
            <p>OUR Saviour had immediatly before in the tenth Verſe urged this Argument in his Praier for his Diſciples, and here we ſee within ſo little a ſpace he repeateth it again.</p>
            <p>Though therefore we have handled this already, yet becauſe it is repeated again, and it is well obſerved that thoſe things which our Saviour did more then once ſay they have ſome notable Excellency, and deſerve a ſecond Conſideration, according to that old Rule, <hi>Pulchra ſunt bis dicenda</hi>; And in the Hebrew there is often a Gemination of the Word for the more Efficacy and Certainty; Becauſe I ſay it's thus repeated by our Saviour who had infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Treaſures of Wiſedom within him, who was the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and could not be ſtreightned in words, Therefore let us alſo have a ſecond improving of it: You ſee the Argument that it is twice repeated, <hi>They are not of the world,</hi> God is entreated to preſerve them becauſe they are not of the world even as Chriſt is not.</p>
            <p>The Explication of this you have heard already, Therefore I proceed to the Obſervation.</p>
            <p>Obſ. <hi>That it's good for the People of God often and often to meditate on this,</hi>

               </note> 
               <hi>That they are not of the world</hi>; This is a Truth that unleſſe unfolded and drawn out, We can never ſee the Excellency of it, unleſſe you rub and pounce this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into powder, you can never finde the ſweetneſſe of it if you do not as they did to the Sacrifice open it and cut it in peeces, laying every part by it ſelf methodicaly, you cannot ſee the inward excellency of it: The people of God <hi>are not of this world,</hi> they are in it but not of it, They are <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>one doth not more naturally fall to the ground then our Souls till regenerated move to earthly things; Now the Apoſtle argueth to the People of God <hi>Col.</hi> 3.1, 2, 3. <hi>If ye be riſen with Chriſt, ſeek thoſe things that are above, and ſet your affections upon them</hi>: Oh this is a great matter, when not only our minde and tongue but our affections are ſet on things above; The Affections are like wings to the bird, like fire among the Elements, it aſſimilates and turneth every thing into fire; Thus where the beleever affectionately remembers he is not of the world, he cryeth out as the Maid ready to be raviſhed under all inordinate and worldly thoughts, What do you come to overwhelm me for? He runneth away as <hi>Joſeph</hi> from his Miſtreſſe, how can I do this and ſinne againſt God? The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſpeaks in the Name of all Beleevers, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.20. <hi>Our Converſation is in Heaven</hi>; Thus as the Sunne in Heaven though the Beams of it ſhine upon Dunghils and noiſome Jakes, yet it's not defiled; So the Godly though they live in a noiſome, ſinful, and wicked world, yet they are not ſtained there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with becauſe their Converſation is in Heaven, and as the Bird as long as ſhe ſoars on high is out of all danger from the ſnares and gins of the Fowler: Thus the Childe of God as long as his thoughts and his affections are kept a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, and are out of reach, they receive no defilement from theſe things below; Oh then let the Beleever remember he is not of this world, and this will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame him, it will be a fiery Chariot to carry him up into Heaven: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe to be heavenly-minded is a general, and particular things do moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form and affect, <hi>Singularia ſunt, quae pungunt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Which conſiſts in theſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</note>Let us branch it out in particulars, and ſhew you wherein a Godly man, remembring he is not of the world doth expreſſe his heavenly Converſation, and that emptieth it ſelf into theſe ſtreams.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">1. He mortifieth and modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth his affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful things.</note>Firſt, <hi>He mortifieth and moderateth his heart and affections even to lawfull things,</hi> 1 Cor. 7. <hi>The time is ſhort, Thoſe that marry muſt be as if they married not</hi>; Grace doth alter the pallat of Nature, ſo that like old <hi>Barzillai</hi> they take not that delight which once they had in the comforts of the world; <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is content with few things, but Grace with the one neceſſary thing which is God himſelf</hi>; If then thy heart be like a water overrunning the banks, and ſo be muddied, ſtop thy ſelf, and remember thou art not of this world, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou dareſt not over-love or over-deſire, or go beyond thy bounds; Thou haſt indeed theſe mercies but as if thou hadſt them not; Truly this is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent diſcovery of an heavenly heart, when this Ivy doth not ſo cleave to thee as to conſume thee; When thou canſt ſo eat, drink, and enjoy all earthly and worldly Comforts, that yet thou do not diſtemper and diſeaſe thy ſoul.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">2. Worldly things are but ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary and leſſe principal.</note>Secondly, An Heavenly Heart is in theſe worldly things, <hi>when they are made but the ſecondary and the leſſe principall</hi>; They are the Stars not the Sun; This our Saviour makes a fundamentall qualification to every Diſciple; <hi>He that loveth Father or Mother more then me is not worthy of me,</hi> Matth. 10.37. The Godly man therefore hath Chriſt lying neareſt to his heart, There muſt be nothing above him, equall to him, as <hi>David</hi> expreſſeth this predominan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy often, <hi>Whom have I in Heaven but thee?</hi> And <hi>My Soul breaketh for the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging it hath to thee at all times</hi>; And <hi>God was his Portion; The Light of his Countenance was better then Life,</hi> and all Earthly Comfort.: If therefore thou remembreſt thou art not of this world, Earthly things ſhall be admitted on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Court of the Temple, not to thy heart which is the Holy of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies; They are kept at the bottome of the Hill not ſuffered to come up to

the Mount; There is no man if not truly regenerated, though never ſo great in parts and expreſſions of Religion, that giveth Chriſt the better part of his Soul; That gives the Superiority to him; As in the Sacrifices of old, all the fat was to be burnt unto God; Oh then awaken thy ſelf in this matter, if thou art not of the world then God and Chriſt are in the uppermoſt room of thy heart, They are more unto thee then ten thouſand Creatures; To ſay, thou ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> no prophane perſon, no wicked perſon, is a poor and a ſmall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; But art thou one to whom Chriſt is more then Wealth, then honour, and all Greatneſſe?</p>
            <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3. He will not ſin againſt God to obtain great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages.</note> 
               <hi>The man that remembers he is not of the world dareth not ſinne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God to obtain the greatest advantages here below</hi>; This doth neceſſarily follow from the former, For if once he be ſo heavenly as to love God and Chriſt better then all, then he will do nothing that he may loſe them: He will not be ſo fooliſh as to take Dirt, and to loſe Gold: Hence thoſe Hearers that had the <hi>Cares of the world choaking the good Seed,</hi> and thoſe Apoſtates that fell off in Perſecution, all theſe did ſerve <hi>Mammon,</hi> and not God, for when it comes to this, here is an offer and choice, either I muſt loſe God or this worldly advantage: If thou wilt take the preſent world and leave Chriſt, this cannot ſtand with an Heavenly heart: I do not ſpeak of ſome particular paſſages, for the Fleſh ſometimes overcometh the Spirit, but of an habituall and conſtant courſe; Therefore it was a full diſcovery that <hi>Moſes</hi> was not of the world, when he <hi>choſe the Reproaches of Chriſt rather then all the Treaſures of Egypt:</hi> This an earthly heart would never have done.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>The man that remembers he is not of the world, deſires not,</hi>
               <note place="margin">4. He affects worldly things no further then by them he may be ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to God.</note> 
               <hi>nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rejoyceth in worldly things any further then thereby he is made more ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to God and inſtrumental te his glory</hi>; All theſe earthly things they are Talents, and we are called Stewards, Now the Steward looks not upon the money and Rents he receiveth as his, he rejoyceth not in them as his own, He is to improve all for the beſt to his Maſters uſe; Thus the heavenly Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian doth, This Health, This Life, Theſe parts, Theſe Comforts they are none of mine, I am but a Steward, I muſt give an account what improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I have made of them; This is a notable diſcovery of thy heavenlineſſe, when thou art thus affected.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, <hi>He that Conſiders he is not of this world,</hi>
               <note place="margin">5. Labours to keep his heart holy in the midſt of earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly buſineſſe.</note> 
               <hi>his Heavenly-mindedneſſe is diſcovered, in that though he be in the midſt of all theſe buſineſſes, yet he labours to keep his heart holy and fervent</hi>; His Shop doth not dead his heart, his worldly affairs do not dull the Edge of his Spirit, but he can delight in God, call him Father, be fervent and effectuall in Duties: Not but that the moſt Heavenly man which is findes and complaineth of much deadneſſe and dull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: They can be affected with worldly things but not Heavenly, onely they are ſenſible and complain of this dead heart; That as they mourn over a dead Friend, a dead Childe, ſo they do over a dead heart, onely herein they ſtrive and labour, that no worldly thing may any whit abate their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections to God, That they may cry out, and ſay, O Lord, how gladly would I be enjoying of thee, but that this world will not let me; Truly theſe ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings and reſiſtings of the world do very much argue thy ſpiritual and heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly heart.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, <hi>The Heavenly Heart would not be alwaies in the conflicting part of Grace,</hi> but in the triumphing part which is the more heavenly work,<note place="margin">6. Would fain get to the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing part of grace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> for as one Starre differs from another, So one part of Heavenly work is more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent then another; To grapple with Luſts, to fig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> with ſinne, this is Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly work; But to enjoy God, to rejoyce with joy unſpeakable, and full of Glory, this is more Heavenly: Now the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did not ſo much deſire

the deſtroying of the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> that they might be refreſhing themſelves with the Milk and Honey of the Land; As the People of God groan to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove an earthly, a proud heart, luſtful heart, that they might enjoy the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of grace.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">7. Longs for Chriſts co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming.</note>Seventhly, <hi>The Heavenly Heart conſidering it is not of this world doth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore long for and haſten the Coming of Chriſt</hi>; We are daily to pray that Chriſts Kingdom may come, and the Godly are deſcribed by this Expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.29. <hi>They look for, and haſten the Coming of Chriſt</hi>; 2 Pet. 3.12. The Church cryeth, <hi>Come Lord Jeſus, Come quickly</hi>; She praieth vehemently, as if ſhe could not ſtay till he did come? That as <hi>Siſera's</hi> Wife ſtood looking out of the Window expecting her Lords Coming in Triumph, Thus do the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and therefore they are to lift up their Heads, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. Then their Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is over, and their Summer is come, Then ſhall there be no more ſinnes, no more cares, no more clogs nor troubles, thou ſhalt take thy leave of all theſe.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">8. Delights in thoſe things that encreaſe a ſpiritual life.</note>Laſtly, <hi>He that is not of the world delights in ſuch things that doe either beget or encreaſe spiritual and Heavenly Life</hi>; Now all the holy Ordinances of God are appointed for this end, Praier, Preaching of the Word, the ſolemn Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, holy conference, all theſe things are like Wood to keep the Fire al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies burning; You may ſee the Expreſſions <hi>David</hi> uſeth about the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, The <hi>Word was ſweeter then the honey and the honey-comb</hi>: In his Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment there was no earthly thing troubled him ſo much as to be reſtrained and kept from the Solemn and Divine worſhip of God; That heart muſt needs grow cold and dead, that is not often enlivened by theſe, it will quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be like a barren Wilderneſſe, if theſe Clouds drop not on it; The ſame Word that begat thee unto a ſpirituall Life, muſt encreaſe and continue thee therein.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> In the ſecond general place, <hi>It's good to reminde our ſelves often that we are not of the world hereby to preſſe our ſelves to a Non-conformity and Non-compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with it,</hi> Rom. 12. <hi>Be not conformed to the world but transformed in your minde</hi>; We are not to love or delight in what the evil world doth, We are not to do as they do; Though it be the greater part, and though a multitude go that way, yea, though all the world go in an evil way, and though but one man yet thou wilt not ſymbolize with it; And truly this we ought to preſſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our ſelves, how often are we ready to ſay with that man concerning the Maſſe, <hi>Eamus ad communem errorem,</hi> Let us go to the common Errour, Who will ſwim againſt the ſtream? Who is like that River <hi>Alpheus</hi> that though it empty it ſelf in the Sea, yet keeps its own ſweetneſſe, and is not infected with the ſaltneſſe of that water? Oh what a comfortable Teſtimony of grace is it, to be ſuch an one that the world neither by its flatteries or its frowns is able to put thee out of a good path.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> Thirdly, <hi>The frequent meditating on this, that we are not of the world will make us admirably love and commend the Grace of God:</hi> For whoſe heart will not move within him when he ſhall conſider how many thouſands of the world live and die in that worldly diſpoſition, yet God hath ſeperated me from it? Yea, how many of thy acquaintance, of thy Kindred, of thy near Friends, are yet of the world, and thou art not? So that the experimental knowledge of this will fill thy heart and mouth with joy and praiſes; God hath in this done more for thee, then if he had given thee the whole world.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/> Fourthly, <hi>The knowing and thinking this that they are not of the world will make them be content and patient under the afflictions and troubles they meet with in the world</hi>; For ſeeing they are not of the world they matter not how it is with them; Their happineſſe and miſery is not bound up in this Orb; They are Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims and Strangers, and no wonder if ſuch do not matter the accomodations

Often reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon this will bring much Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering</note> If they come to an unfurniſhed Inne they will make a ſhift, they will ſay, it is but for a night, and thus if we are not of the world, though God lay this chaſtiſement upon us, though he raiſe up that trouble a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us, yet it's but a night, they are not of this Countrey, and therefore cannot be undone here.</p>
            <p>In the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> place, <hi>The often reflecting upon this, that we are not of this world, will bring much conſolation</hi>: For</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Hereby God will take the more ſpecial care of us,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1.

            </p>
            <p n="2">2 Here is Conſolation, <hi>Becauſe they have the fit qualification of theſo who come under Chriſts Praier</hi>; You ſee that which makes Chriſt ſo earneſtly commend them io his Father, is becauſe they are not of the world, <hi>The effectual fervent praier of a righteous man prevails much,</hi> how much more will Chriſts praier?</p>

            </p>
            <p>The word <hi>to ſanctifie</hi> is of a large ſignification in the Scripture; but to our purpoſe, here are two principal ones,</p>
            <p>Firſt, To <hi>ſanctifie</hi> is often to <hi>conſecrate</hi> and ſet apart to an holy uſe; and thus many expound it, that our Saviour doth by this prayer commend them unto God in their Miniſterial labour; That as the Prieſts of old were ſanctified by many external Rites, ſo are the Diſciples in a ſpiritual manner by Chriſt at this time; and this appeareth probable by the verſe following, <hi>As thou haſt ſent me into the world, even ſo have I alſo ſent them into the world.</hi> This therefore is part of the meaning, but I ſhall referre the conſidering of that notion to the next verſe.</p>
            <p>The ſecond general and frequent uſe of the word, is to make <hi>inwardly holy,</hi> by renewing all the parts and abilities of the ſoul, to walk in an holy manner; and in this ſenſe it is partly to be taken here, becauſe the Word of God is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental cauſe of it.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi>
               </note>And if you ask, <hi>How could Chriſt pray for the ſanctification of his Diſciples, who were already ſanctified?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi>
               </note>To this the Anſwer is eaſie, That he prayeth for the continuance of, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in ſanctification, That they may be more and more increaſing in holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; for no man is come ſo farre, that he cannot go further, he is not at the utmoſt of holineſſe. Hence we ſee the Scripture ſpeaking of, or ſuppoſing perſons already godly, doth yet exhort and command Sanctification ſtill, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5 23. <hi>I pray God ſanctifie you wholly, and preſerve your whole ſpirit, ſoul and body blameleſſe.</hi> Here thoſe that are already ſanctified, yet are
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:65216:249"/>
prayed for, to have a further degree, and deeper rooting of Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
            <p>So <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.23, 24. There he writeth to ſuch as are already converted, <hi>That they be renewed in the ſpirit of their minde, and that they put on the new man</hi>; yea to theſe Diſciples our Saviour ſpeaketh, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.3. <hi>Except ye be converted,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>By this you ſee, That even thoſe who are ſanctified or converted, may be more ſanctified, and converted more cloſely to God: For although it be true, That if <hi>Sanctification</hi> be <hi>ſtrictly</hi> taken for the ſame with <hi>Regeneration,</hi> then it's the infuſion of a ſupernaturall life at once: So that as a man is born but once naturally, ſo we may ſay, he is regenerated and ſanctified but once; yet take it more largely for the improving and increaſing of grace thus put into us; then we are to be more converted, and more ſanctified dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and in this reſpect, Sanctification is ſaid to differ from Juſtification, becauſe the former doth admit of degrees, and is more or leſſe, but ſo is not Juſtification.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſerv.</hi> That whereas the Diſciples, though already ſanctified and made holy, yet are prayed for, that they may be more ſanctified. We may gather,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the moſt holy men that are, are yet to be more holy.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Obſerv.</hi>
               </note> It's not enough to be once called or converted, but we are to grow in grace. As it is not enough for a childe to be borne, but he muſt grow up to be a man. Thus <hi>Revel.</hi> 22.11. <hi>He that is holy (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) let him be holy ſtill</hi>; and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1. <hi>Perfecting holineſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is a very neceſſary point, for our Saviour <hi>John</hi> 15. ſaith, <hi>He chooſeth us, that we may bring forth more fruit:</hi> Doeſt thou increaſe in thy faith, in thy heavenly-mindedneſſe, in thy zeal? Thou canſt bleſſe God, when thou findeſt thy health and bodily ſtrength better, when thou findeſt thy eſtate increaſe, and why then art thou not more deſirous, and rejoycing to ſee thy heart grow better, to ſee thy ſoul more ſanctified? And indeed concerning the former things, our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Which of you by taking care can adde one cubit to his ſtature?</hi> But here by fervent and conſtant prayers, we may adde many cubits.</p>
            <p>But to open this Doctrine, Let us conſider,<note place="margin">How many wayes a godly man may be more ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</note> 
               <hi>How many waies a godly man may be more ſanctified,</hi> and that is ſeen in ſeveral particulars.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>He may be more ſanctified intenſively, by adding more and more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees to the grace he hath received.</hi> Our Love, our Faith, our Patience, even all our Graces are capable of augmentation. It's not with us;<note place="margin">1. Inrenſively.</note> as with Chriſt, who received the <hi>Spirit without meaſure</hi>; ſo that Chriſt could not be more holy then he was; he could not do any thing more obedientially to God,<note place="margin">2. Extenſively.</note> then he did, nor love God more then he did; but we may all cry out with that man, <hi>Lord, I believe, help my unbelief</hi>; Lord, I love, help my want of love: Therefore <hi>James</hi> 1.4. we are exhorted <hi>to let patience have her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect work</hi>; Even as <hi>Apelles</hi> upon all his Pictures would write <hi>Faciebat non fecit,</hi> becauſe he would ſtill be perfecting it; thus are we to all our gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Hence are thoſe daily exhortations, <hi>To grow in Grace:</hi> Even a <hi>Paul,</hi> even the talleſt Gyants are to grow in Grace. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>He knoweth but in part,</hi> 1 Cor. 13. and then he can but love in part, and believe in part: Oh then, this is of great concernment, to think that thy beſt graces may yet be made farre better! Thy Grace is nothing to a <hi>Pauls,</hi> and a <hi>Pauls</hi> is nothing to the Law, or the Rule, Look to it then, and be as deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to grow in Grace, as ever thou wert to get into the ſtate of Grace.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>We may be more ſanctified extenſively,</hi> in regard of the <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</hi>
               <pb n="460" facs="tcp:65216:250"/>
about which our Graces are to be exerciſed, and in reſpect of our <hi>Relations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. There is an extenſion in reſpect of our <hi>Objects</hi> of Grace. As we are bound to do better then we doe; ſo to do more then we doe. What godly man is there, that can ſay, he hath done all things God required? Art thou not guilty of many omiſſions of duties? Thou haſt not reproved, mourned, prayed for others; Thou haſt not done that ſpirituall and temporall good thou ſhouldſt. <hi>Paul</hi> excuſed the <hi>Philippians</hi> that they would have done good, but they wanted an opportunity, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.16. But how many times have we an opportunity, and we want hearts? <hi>John</hi> could write to that pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Gaius</hi> his Hoſt, 3 <hi>John verſ.</hi> 2. to wiſh that his <hi>body may be in health, even as his ſoul proſpered.</hi> What a glorious commendation was this? It was better with his ſoule, then his outward man. Now wee cannot ſay thus of our ſelves, becauſe we are not diligent and induſtrious to doe more then we doe. Certainly, every godly man may be aſtoniſhed, when he ſhall conſider, how broad the Commandements of God are, and how narrow his heart is growne in doing more then thou haſt done.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Thou mayeſt be ſanctified extenſively, by the <hi>Relations that thou doeſt take upon thee,</hi> when made an Husband, a Wife, a Miniſter, a Magiſtrate, here thy holineſſe is to extend further, God requireth more of thee, and that godlineſſe which would have ſerved thee before, will not now. While the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles were private men, they needed not that Sanctification which they were to have as Apoſtles. Hence we ſee the Apoſtle diligently in his Epiſtles, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming Husbands, Wives, Children and Servants of what they have to doe: And certainly, the grace of our Relations is an excellent evidence of our ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe in the main: If the Heathen could ſay, He was not <hi>Bonus vir,</hi> that was not <hi>Bonus civis,</hi> not a good man, that was not a good Citizen: So may we ſay, He is not a good Chriſtian, that is not a good Miniſter, a good Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, a good Husband, a good Servant. The Apoſtle bids <hi>Archippus ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill his Miniſtry:</hi> And thus Miniſters are exhorted <hi>to look to the flock over which God hath ſet them.</hi> Oh then ſee, if thou mayeſt not be greatly ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in thy Relations, if they may not be filled with more Wiſdome, Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and exemplarity of Converſation! <hi>Alexander</hi> wept, becauſe there was no more Worlds, he wanted work. But to be ſure, thou haſt more then ever thou canſt turn unto: Every Relation requires a new grace, or a new exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of grace: So that here is no time for thee to ſit down, or to be ſtill, as if all thy enemies were conquered.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">3. In the deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er radication of grace in our hearts.</note>Thirdly, <hi>We may be more ſanctified in the deeper radication of Grace in our hearts.</hi> It's a Philoſophicall Diſpute, Whether accidents are intenſed by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of degrees, or a deeper radication of them in the ſubject? We may conclude, That grace in the heart is both wayes improved, and for the root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it in the ſoul: This is ſo great a matter, that the <hi>temporary believer</hi> is in this reſpect as well as others, mainly differenced from the true believer. Though they had ſome root, yet they had not root enough, and the unwiſe builder did not dig deep enough; for this therefore the Apoſtle prayeth, even in reference to ſuch as were already rooted in Chriſt, that they may be more rooted, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2.7. <hi>Rooted and built up in him.</hi> And to this purpoſe are all thoſe Exhortations of being <hi>ſtedfaſt and immoveable,</hi> of being <hi>ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſtabliſhed. ſettled,</hi> 1 Pet. 5, 10. as there the Apoſtle prayeth remrkably. There is no man hath laid ſo ſure a foundatinn, but he may make it more ſure: No man is ſo eſtabliſhed, but he may be more eſtabliſhed: Is it not a terrible thing to ſee the fall of many Cedars in <hi>Lebanon,</hi> of many Starres from Heaven? And why is all this? They were never eſtabliſhed deep enough,
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:65216:250"/>
they never took more root downwards; like unwiſe builders, they attended to make a glorious upper-room, and ſtairs in the houſe, but mattered not the foundation; and certainly, though the childe of God, even of the loweſt form, be ſo farre rooted, that he ſhall never fall away, yet this eſtabliſhment and ſtedfaſtneſs of his, is not by his own power and ſtrength, it's God that keeps him, neither is it continued, but in the conſtant daily exerciſe of holy means: Oh then every day be indeavouring after this, Lord, grace is not rooted in me enough, it's too ſuperficiall! Oh that I could ſay, <hi>I no longer live, but Chriſt within me!</hi> Oh that it were like leaven diffuſing it's power over me, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. <hi>I will write my Law in thine inwards parts,</hi> in the midſt of them! So that grace ſhall be habituated in thee, and ſink as deep, as ever original ſin did in thee.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>We may be more ſanctified Subjectively,</hi>
               <note place="margin">4. Subjectively</note> 
               <hi>that is every part of the ſoul may be more throughly ſanctified every day:</hi> as in that place, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.23. Hence to the converted <hi>Epheſians,</hi> the Apoſtle exhorts, as you heard, both a further renovation of the minde, and of the will and affections, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.23, 24. In the mind, How greatly may we be more ſanctified, have more illumination, more heavenly knowledge of God and Chriſt? Thou art to grow in knowledge more and more; <hi>Paul</hi> was once like a childe, but he became a man; The Apoſtle <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. doth ſeverely reprove thoſe that continued babes, and were not carried on to further perfection. It's both a ſhame and a ſinne, that thou haſt yet no more knowledge, and heavenly underſtanding, by the Miniſtry thou haſt enjoyed ſo many years. Again, the minde is to be more ſanctified by a more firm and <hi>ſolid faith,</hi> the Apoſtle then directs, <hi>That they ſhould be ſtedfaſt and ſound in the faith, not toſſed up and down with every winde of doctrine.</hi> Their increaſe of faith may be both in the Objects believed, though for the things neceſſary to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the knowledge of them by the Spirit of God is promiſed to every belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, yet there the ſuperſtructions in Religion, which according to the means we enjoy, we are to believe. Therefore the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3.10. ſheweth his earneſt prayer to come to the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> that he might <hi>perfect what was lacking in their faith</hi>; which could not be meant in regard of foundations, but ſuperſtructures; not eſſentials, but additionals. Thus they are to grow in the doctrine of believing, <hi>but then in the manner of believing, that is the proper way for all to grow.</hi> To believe more certainly, more firmly, more practical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Therefore though the fundamentals of Religion cannot be augmented: No neceſſary truth to ſalvation can be revealed, which was not known be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, yet it may be more ſtrongly and clearly believed. And this is the end of all Authors, that write againſt Heretiques of all ſorts, not to bring a new Religion into the world, or new Articles of Faith, but to cauſe a more clear and firm aſſent to thoſe things, which the ſubtilty of Heretiques had obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Further, Their mindes are to be more ſanctified by holy thoughts, heavenly-Meditation: For what godly man doth not perceive vain thoughts creeping into his ſoul, as the Froggs did into <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Chamber, whether he will or no; and as for a fixed heavenly-Meditation, it's an unknown duty a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>Thus as the minde is to be more ſanctified, ſo we might ſhew all other parts of ſoul and body. <hi>The will of a man is to be more bowed, and made more vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and powerfull in the things of God.</hi> To overcome thoſe velleities and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compleat wiſhings which are ſo apt to undo us, To go beyond <hi>Paul,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf deſires to overcome himſelf, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. <hi>What I would not, that I doe.</hi> To have this no longer, but what I would, that I do. And for the Affections, who is not ſenſible, what further Sanctification they need? Sanctified anger, ſanctified deſires, How beautifull and comfortable would they be? Who doth not finde them overrunning and going beyond all bounds, ſo that nothing can
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:65216:251"/>
order them within their limits? The Body likewiſe, though that be the bruitiſh part, yet the Apoſtle prayeth for the <hi>ſanctification</hi> of it, which is then done, <hi>when it's no more inſtrumental to ſinne</hi>; the eyes, the hands, the tongue have an holy watch over them, and are imployed for God. Thus you ſee that every part of the whole man admits of further Sanctification. A man cannot look over all that he hath and doth, as God did on his works, and ſee all exceeding good, ſo as to reſt thereupon, and worke no more. We may ſee every day more to be done, and ſo never come to a full Reſt, till we are in Heaven.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, <hi>We are to be more ſanctified Objectively, that is, Thoſe objects revealed in the Scripture, we are to partake more of, to receive more ſweetneſs and fulneſs from.</hi> Doth not the Apoſtle pray for the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> of whom he affirmeth the glorious priviledges of the Goſpel? Yet <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.17, 18, 19. <hi>That their eyes may be inlightned to know what is the exceeding power of God to them that believe.</hi> And again <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.17, 18, 19. <hi>That Chriſt may dwell in your hearts, that ye may be able to comprehend what is the breadth, and depth, and length of Gods love.</hi> And leſt it ſhould be thought, that we are able to do this to the full, he addeth, <hi>And to know the love of God, which paſſeth all knowledge</hi>; Yea, the very glorious things of the Goſpel, even in this life are ſuch, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.9. <hi>That eyes have not ſeen, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath it entred into the heart of a man to underſtand.</hi> There is as much in God, in Chriſt, in Faith, in every Scripture-truth, that thou mayeſt make it new to thee every day. Chriſt may be a new Chriſt, Heaven a new Heaven; for every divine Truth is like ſome ſtately and magnificent Palace, wherein every room affords thee ſome new wonder and delight; and this is the reaſon why <hi>John</hi> 4. Chriſt ſaith, <hi>He that drinketh of that water,</hi> which is Chriſt, <hi>ſhall never thirſt more:</hi> Oh then this is our great ſinne and our hindrance alſo, that ſuch dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are in the Goſpel, and we do not ſuck them out! There is no heavenly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe or comfort, but if thou didſt go to draw out of it, thou wouldſt finde it a deep Well, which can never be drawn dry: Oh then know, if Chriſt and holy things do not raviſh thy ſoul, it's becauſe thy heart is narrow! How can a veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel with a narrow mouth, receive all the water of the Sea into it?</p>

            <p>THoſe that are already ſanctified may yet be further ſanctified, and that in ſeveral particulars, as you have heard.</p>
            <p>There remain ſome other Inſtances to be added, wherein this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of Sanctification may appear.</p>
            <p>And the firſt which is alſo very remarkable is,<note place="margin">5. <hi>Efficienter.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>That our Sanctification is to grow</hi> efficienter, <hi>by way of inviting, exhorting, and bringing home others to it</hi>; For thus we are more ſanctified when we are enlarged to ſanctifie others in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentally; This ſome take to be the meaning, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.8. where Chriſt tels his Diſciples, that <hi>herein his Father is glorified if they bring forth much fruit</hi>; And <hi>verſ.</hi> 16. <hi>I have ordained you that you ſhould go and bring forth much fruit,</hi> which is in reſpect of their miniſterial emploiment; So then if thou askeſt how may I be more and more ſanctified? The Anſwer is ready, Be ſanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing others actively and inſtrumentally: Think it the greateſt honour in the world if thou art a means to make others holy, for though God would uſe no means or Inſtruments in the Creation of the world, yet he will in the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the New Creature: Now Miniſters they are by Office appointed to ſanctifie others: The word or Truth which is the Inſtrument of San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification is publiſhed by them; Therefore a ſanctified Miniſter doth deſire nothing more then to have a ſanctified people, he deſireth that it may be a Vineyard, a Garden, not a Wilderneſſe that he is to till and look to, he cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out with <hi>Rachel</hi> in a ſpirituall ſence, <hi>Give me Children, elſe I die</hi>; All his Study and Sermons tend to this, that his Hearers may be ſanctified, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly if Chriſt himſelf endured all that reproach and ſhame for Souls, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth to have the ſame minde that was in Chriſt; That as Chriſt is promiſed <hi>to ſee his Seed after the Travell of his Soul,</hi> So doth he pray, that after all his pains and endeavours he may ſee an holy Seed; So that your Sanctification is that for which we pray and preach, yea, private Chriſtians in their way are to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in their Sanctification by promoting it in others, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 51. when <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> had recovered out of his ſinne, <hi>then would he teach tranſgreſſors their waies,</hi> When one Diſciple was converted, preſently he goeth and calleth his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Oh the admirable Zeal that <hi>Paul</hi> ſhewed to his Kinſmen after the Fleſh, that <hi>he could wiſh to be an Anathema for them</hi>! You that are Parents
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:65216:252"/>
grow in this active Sanctification, Let not God alone by Praier untill your Children be ſanctified: What a Comfort would it be unto you to be both the Natural and the Spirituall Fathers of your Children: Thus ye that are Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters grow alſo in Sanctification by Sanctifying Servants, by having a Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Family: Oh it's to be be feared thou knoweſt not the Worth and the Excellency of a ſanctified Eſtate, or the danger of an unſanctified one, that art no more diligent to call others out of it, if rightly apprehenſive herein; Thou wouldſt do as the Angel did to <hi>Lot,</hi> while he lingered and tarried in <hi>Sodome,</hi> pull him out by violence as it were, that he might not periſh; Philoſophers ſay, There is this difference between thoſe Creatures that are generated of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trid matter, and ſuch as come of their kinde, that the former though they live and move, yet cannot generate the like, or propagate individuals, becauſe they come of putrid matter, and certainly it's thus here: Thoſe that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed born of God, and have that Divine Seed in them, all their Care and Delight is to bring others into the ſame eſtate and condition alſo, but then thoſe who profeſſe holineſſe from carnall and corrupt ends, they care not for this work of Converſion in others, like Adulterers that reſpect not Children but their luſts.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>We may be more ſanctified in the better improving of the means of Sanctification,</hi> For God he hath appointed ſpirituall Ordinances, the good managing whereof will greatly advance the Principles of Sanctification with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in us: Now the Ordinances are Prayer, Hearing of the Word and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and whatſoever holy Inſtitution Chriſt hath appointed and decreed for to make us better; The way therefore to be more Sanctified is to pray better, to hear better, and indeed it would be well if thou didſt ſet upon the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thy Corruptions, but not only of them but of thy Duties alſo; Not only to reſolve I will be proud no more, and earthly no more, and paſſionate no more, but I will not pray ſo formally, ſo coldly, nor ſo negligently as I have done any more; A man that groweth better in his Health, eats his meat bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and doth digeſt it better; And thus if thou wilt proceed from Holineſſe to Holineſſe, Thou wilt pray with more Zeal and Faith, hear with more atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and fear: It's impoſſible you ſhould ever grow in Sanctification unleſſe you do begin to amend in your duties, As the Diſciples were mending their nets, elſe they could get no fiſh.</p>
            <p>Thirdly and Laſtly, <hi>We are to be more ſanctified in reſpect of Continuance and Duration</hi>; It is not enough that thou wert once made holy and Righteous, but thou art to continue and perſevere therein to the end; For how many did begin in the Spirit, but yet have ended in the Fleſh? You have a terrible In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance <hi>Hebr.</hi> 10.29. where a man ſaid to be <hi>Sanctified by the Bloud of Chriſt</hi> is yet ſaid at laſt <hi>to tread under foot the Bloud of Christ, making no account of it:</hi> It is true this man was not truly Sanctified, for then he could not have ſo total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly apoſtatized, for he had ſome imperfect and inchoate motions of Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, He was an <hi>Embryo</hi> and did prove <hi>abortive,</hi> and thus all the Ages of the Church have given ſundry and ſad Inſtances of ſuch Hypocriſies and Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies: Therefore the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> Revel. 22.12. after the divers Viſions and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations he had about the Church, he concludeth, <hi>Let him that is holy be holy ſtill,</hi> Let him continue and perſiſt in his Holineſſe, So that whatſoever changes and alterations there may be in the Church, yet thou art not to change or to vary in thy Holineſſe,<note place="margin">Growth in Sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on illuſtrated by the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries unto it, which are theſe,</note> and certainly ſuch is the oppoſition, and ſo great are the Contrarieties to all Sanctification in Heavens way, That it's a wonder of wonders that a man is not deprived, doth not loſe all, or be diſcouraged out of it.</p>
            <p>In the next place Let us illuſtrate this Growth in Sanctification by the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites and contraries to it, and they are,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="465" facs="tcp:65216:252"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> Firſt, <hi>Idleneſſe, Negligence, or Security</hi>; He that is idle in his outward Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling can never expect to encreaſe in his Wealth, Poverty comes like an armed man upon ſuch, and thus it is with him that is lazy in his ſpiritual Calling: As <hi>Solomon</hi> obſerveth of the Sluggard, <hi>He paſſed by and ſaw his Field full of Thorns and Briars</hi>; Thus it is with every one that liveth negligently, his whole life will immediatly be filled with all kinde of vice and folly. Want of Exerciſe doth breed Diſeaſes in the body, and ſo neglect of ſpirituall Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe doth conſume the Soul, Idleneſſe and further Sanctification can be no more conſiſtent then light and darkneſſe together.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> Secondly, <hi>Barrenneſſe,</hi> This is the fruit of Idleneſſe: As the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>He that doth not work let him not eat,</hi> Let him ſtarve if he will; This is alſo true here, He that will not labour in a ſpirituall manner, he ſhall not eat, he ſhall neither have more Grace, or more comfort, Barrenneſſe in one that look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to Heaven is a very hainous ſinne, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.7. <hi>The Earth which drinketh in much rain, and yet is barren, is nigh to curſing</hi>; Did not our Saviour ſay to the Fig-Tree that had no fruit on it, <hi>Never fruit grow on thee more,</hi> Matth. 21.12. So that God puniſheth barrenneſſe with barrenneſſe: It's thy ſinne to bear no fruit, and it ſhall be thy Curſe; How ſeverely was that unprofitable Servant dealt with, who though he did not imbezill his Maſters Talent, yet becauſe he hid it in a Napkin, and did not improve it, Therefore he is commanded to be caſt into utter darkneſſe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.30. Tremble then under all manner of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitfulneſſe and unprofitableneſſe, Say, How doth this agree with Growth in Grace?</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> Thirdly, Another great oppoſite to further Sanctification is <hi>Apoſtacy and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinings in godlineſſe,</hi> which are either gradual in the truly godly, or totall in him that appeareth to be ſo only, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. Gods great Controverſie with ſome of thoſe Churches, was becauſe <hi>they fell from their firſt love,</hi> and they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to <hi>ſtrengthen the things that are ready to die</hi>; This is to be a very <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>podes</hi> to encreaſe in grace, when thy Sunne doth not ſtand ſtill, but go back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and ſtill more backward; Oh fear theſe Conſumptions of the Soul, Thou haſt not the life, the vigour, the zeal of Grace once thou hadſt, thou art not the man thou wert once; Thou art like <hi>Sampſon</hi> that hath loſt his ſtrength, like old <hi>Barzillai</hi> that canſt not take thy wonted delight in heavenly things, Oh be afraid of theſe languors, and repent from whence thou art fallen; But the godly Soul may be hereupon dejected, and queſtion whether ever it were tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſanctified or not, for they finde much decay; They have often dead and cold hearts, yea, they are not as lively as they have been, They are even turned into ſtones, and are like Idols in Chriſtianity, having eyes they ſee not, and hearts they underſtand hot.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. Art thou thus exerciſed, <hi>Deſpiſe not this Chaſtiſement of God,</hi> yea, make an advantage of it; To feel the diſeaſe is the way to be cured; Bleſſe God that hath done thus for thee, that though thou doſt not grow in grace, or encreaſe, yet thou ſeeſt this decay, and bewaileſt it; A man that ſees he goes behinde in his Eſtate, and layeth it to his heart, he will be careful to prevent it betimes.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. <hi>Know theſe humiliations and bewailings are a kinde of further Sanctification in thee,</hi> For to grow in Grace is to diſcern more and more our Imperfections, to be acquainted with all the need and wants that we are in; As he that grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in Learning ſeeth how much he is ignorant of, and thus he that groweth in holineſſe, he ſeeth himſelf more unholy then ever, he thinketh he hath leſſe Grace then ever, becauſe he is more tender and diſcerning then he was before; As a man recovering out of a diſeaſe is more ſenſible of pain and his weakneſſe then he was in the height of his ſickneſſe.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. <hi>There may be a growing in gifts and parts, and a growing in Graece</hi>; This di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction is greatly to be marked, for a Chriſtian through bodily diſtempers
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:65216:253"/>
and old Age may decay in parts, not have the memory, nor the activity, or the hot affections he had once, and yet be a more mortified and ſolid Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, for Grace will not cure a man of bodily Diſeaſes or of Old Age, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Soul doth work dependantly upon the body, as the body it's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument doth decay, ſo are the Souls Operations impaired thereby; But be not diſcouraged, this is not a decay in Grace, it's only in parts and gifts, or a bodily conſtitution, which though comfortable mercies, yet are not Eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als to grace; On the other ſide there are too many that encreaſe in Knowledge, that are enlarged in parts, but decay in grace, yea, their corruptions and luſts grow with them.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 4. <hi>Diſtinguiſh between a further Sanctification in reſpect of the ſolidity of it, and the affectionateneſſe of it</hi>; Every decay in affection is not preſently an abating in grace, for <hi>godlineſſe lyeth chiefly in the minde and will,</hi> If theſe be ſolidly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed and really bent for God, Though affections be not paſſionately and ſenſiby put forth, yet thou maiſt grow a more ſound and firm Chriſtian.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> 5. <hi>There is difference between a further Sanctification, and the certainty and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of it</hi>; Many a Chriſtian groweth in holineſſe, yet he is not ſenſible of his growth as in nature a man groweth, yet doth not perceive it; What our Saviour ſpake of the ſpreading and growing of the Goſpel, is true alſo in reſpect of Sanctification, <hi>Mar.</hi> 4.27. It's as if a man ſhould caſt Seed in the ground, and ſhould ſleep, and riſe night and day, and the Seed ſpring up and grow he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not how; Thus the godly they ſhoot out in grace, when yet they do not perceive it, yea, ſometimes they are tempted to the clean contrary.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> 6. Grant it be true, that thou art leſſe ſanctified then before, thou haſt decai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſadly, <hi>Let this then quicken thee up to make the more haſte for the future</hi>; Let this ſtumbling make thee get ground, Sometimes a <hi>David,</hi> a <hi>Peter,</hi> are left to fall, that they may riſe and go the faſter; After ſome diſeaſes the childe grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth more then ever, The Traveller that hath overſlept himſelf, doubles his pace; Thus let thy very decaies do good to thee.</p>

            <p>Firſt, <hi>We ſay the Word of God made known unto us, is thus an inſtrument; and this bringeth in the neceſſity of Officers in the Church, who by their Gifts and Miniſtry are to interpret and publiſh the Word of God to us.</hi> For if the Scriptures
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:65216:254"/>
be kept in the Originall Tongue, they are unknown to moſt people, and ſo are like a Candle under a Buſhell, or like a Fountain ſealed up. God therefore who hath appointed his Word as a Rule, hath alſo <hi>given gifts to men,</hi> that there may be ſuch, <hi>who ſhall divide this Word aright,</hi> and give his children fit meat in their due ſeaſon; So that if a man ignorant of the Tongues, ſhould have a Bible in Hebrew and Greek, What good could he get by it, till tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and interpreted? This is like a veil upon the Scripture, and therefore doth as much hinder our underſtanding, as if we had a veil upon our hearts: Hence it hath been the good Providence of God, to raiſe up ſuch able and willing men, who have been ready to tranſlate the Scripture into all kinde of Langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, that ſo every Nation might have it in their known Tongue. We ſay there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Word of God made known to us is thus powerfull.</p>
            <p>Secondly, We ſay it's <hi>Inſtrumentall:</hi> Now there is a two-fold Inſtrument,<note place="margin">The Word is Gods inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and faith is mans.</note> as to our purpoſe, both which meeting together, the Word produceth it's compleat effects, <hi>There is Gods Inſtrument, that which he hath appointed on his part</hi>; And then, <hi>There is that which is Inſtrumentall on our part, and that is Faith.</hi> As in the fore-mentioned place of 2 <hi>Timothy</hi> 3.16. <hi>The Scriptures are able to make thee wiſe to ſalvation, through faith:</hi> So that as Chriſt, who is the eſſentiall Word of God, <hi>dwels in our hearts by faith.</hi> Thus the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures the revealed Word of God, become effectuall to us by believing, <hi>The Word did not profit the Iſraelites, becauſe not mingled with faith,</hi> Heb. 4.6. So that as the Word of God is a neceſſary inſtrument on Gods part; Thus faith is a neceſſary inſtrument on mans part: Whenſoever God cauſeth his Word to be publiſhed, be thou ready to prepare a believing heart. This is that which diffuſeth the Word through the whole ſoul. The Word is Bread, but it's faith that eats it, and digeſts it. No Sermon can ever doe thee the leaſt good, unleſſe Faith write it down in thy heart. Goe home believing ſuch pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Scripture, and this will antidote againſt ſinne: If humane Faith can turne a man wholly upſide downe, How much more may divine Faith?</p>

There are many Heretiques and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous perſons, who are full of Scripture, will alledge many places of Gods Word, but putting their corrupt gloſſes upon it, it's no more Gods truth, but mans errour, and therefore are not ſanctified by it, in which ſenſe <hi>Luther</hi> called the Bible, The Heretiques book, becauſe they would all confidently boaſt, they grounded their opinions upon that Book, when indeed it was upon their own corruptions: Oh then, beſides frequent knowledge and excellent memory of the Scripture, know a further thing is requiſite, even the Spirit of God to lead thee by this Rule into the truth, elſe it is with the Scripture, as it was with that pillar in the wilderneſs, it was light to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to guide them, but darkneſs to the <hi>Egyptians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="470" facs="tcp:65216:255"/>2. <hi>The Word of God is not bleſſed to ſanctifie our affections, and reform our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, unleſſe God come in as the principal, cauſe.</hi> As the Prophets ſervant could do no good in raiſing the dead childe, till the Prophet his Maſter came; ſo though thou take up the Scripture, reade ſuch a place an hundred times over againſt that very ſinne thou liveſt in, yet it doth not ſanctifie till God ſet it home upon thee. <hi>Nicodemus</hi> was groſly ignorant about the work of Regeneration, yet no doubt being a Maſter in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> he had often read that promiſe, <hi>That God would take away an heart of ſtone, and give an heart of fleſh:</hi> and doth not ſad experience tell us, of many that have great knowledge in Scripture, yet they live prophanely and groſly? It's true, ſuch men are to look for greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation then others, but yet how common is it for ſuch who know, and read the Word of God, yet not to be reformed in their lives thereby. Though they look in this glaſs, yet they waſh not thoſe loathſome ſpots that are upon them, conclude the Scriptures are not in their proper uſe to thee, till they have reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thee from ſuch ſins, as thou didſt formerly live in?</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>The people of God, though they have a ſpiritual life within them, yet under de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertions and temptations finde not the Word of God effectual for joy and conſolations, till God bring ſuch texts, and ſuch promiſes cloſe to their ſoul. That we,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul, through the Scriptures might have conſolations,</hi> 2 Cor. 1. And <hi>David</hi> doth often acknowledge, <hi>That the word of God did comfort and revive him</hi>; but let a godly man groaning under the guilt of ſinne, hear the ſound of the Goſpel a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times over, yet he will remain like dried bones, and a parched wilderneſs, till God ſanctifie it: Oh how often have the people of God deſired comfort and aſſurance, read over the promiſes again and again, gone to the Miniſters of the Goſpel to have oyl poured in their wounds, yet not the Law, but even the Goſpel hath been made a dead letter, till the Spirit of God doth comfort in and by it, the Word then of God, though inſtrumental, yet is but inſtrumentall, it's not a principal.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Inſtrumentall Cauſes are phyſical, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral or moral.</note>Fourthly, When we ſay it's <hi>Inſtrumentall to Sanctification, we are to diſtinguiſh of inſtrumental cauſes: For there are Phyſical and Natural Inſtruments, which work by an inherent and natural power, and there are Moral Inſtruments, which work by the ſole inſtitution and appointment of another.</hi> Now the Word of God is not inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental to Sanctification in the former, but in the later way. The Word doth not by any inherent vertue and efficacy in a natural manner purifie the heart, but by Gods appointment and his voluntary co-operation, when and where he will; For if it did work thus naturally, then whereſoever the Word is preached, it would ſanctifie, it would heal: As the fire whereever it is, in one Countrey as well as in another, it doth burn, but experience doth confute this, Are there not two hearing the Word of God, the one is ſanctified, the other not? At the ſame Sermon one is humbled, made tender; The other is more obſtinate and hardened: Whence comes all this diverſity under the Word preached, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not a natural inſtrument?</p>
            <p>Again, <hi>If the word of God did convert and ſanctifie naturally, then the grace of God could not ſo much be amplified and magnified, which yet the Scriptures do.</hi> Though it be Gods goodneſs, that the Sunne ſhineth, the fire burneth, yet we do not ſpeak of it, or call it his grace, but if the Word of God ever touch and heat any mans heart, if it ever reform his life, this is the meer grace of God. By which it appeareth, That the Word of God is inſtrumental only by Gods inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, and where he commands it to work, there it works; where he requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth it to break down all oppoſitions, there it hurrieth all down before it; In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that ſometimes the moſt unlikely and prophaneſt enemies to godlineſs, they are changed by the Word,<note place="margin">One cauſe muſt not be oppoſed to other cauſes.</note> and thoſe that are very ingenuous and civilly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſed, remain in a perverſe oppoſition.</p>
            <p n="5">5. When we ſay, <hi>The Word of God is inſtrumentall to our Sanctification, this is
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:65216:255"/>
not to be oppoſed to thoſe other cauſes, which God hath appointed.</hi> Grace is the <hi>ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient cauſe,</hi> and Chriſt the <hi>meritorious cauſe,</hi> onely this is the <hi>medium</hi>; God who could convert immediately, and reach home to our ſouls, as he did to the Prophets by an immediate Revelation, hath taken this way. That as it's the goodneſs of God in natural things, though he be the firſt and univerſall cauſe, and ſo could do all things immediately himſelf, yet he hath ordained ſecond cauſes, who have their derived cauſality. Thus it hath pleaſed God in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of his Church, to uſe means and external helps, the Word and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, thereby to work grace, when yet he could change the hearts of men immediately, or communicate himſelf to his Church, as he did once without Scriptures; When therefore you hear many oppoſe the Scripture to the Spirit, and the Miniſtry in the Church to Chriſts teaching, this is abſurd and tends to the diviſion of thoſe cauſes, which God hath ſo wiſely joyned together. The Spirit and the Scripture muſt not be oppoſed, nor Chriſts teaching and the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters; for that Rule is true here, <hi>Quando duorum unum eſt propter aliud, ſunt ut unum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sixthly, <hi>The Word thus made known,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Word is the ordinary means.</note> 
               <hi>is the ordinary means both of our beginning and increaſe in Sanctification.</hi> Two things are couched in this particular, 1. It's <hi>the ordinary means</hi>; ſo that what God may do in extraordinary caſes, is not for us to diſpute, but ordinarily there is no other way to beget and increaſe grace but this. Neither may we ſay this is diſhonourable to God, to binde him to one way; for it hath pleaſed himſelf to appoint the communication of his grace by the Word ordinarily; ſo that as in naturall things, he will give light to the world only by the Sunne, though he could do otherwiſe; Therefore the Sunne was not made till the fourth day, to ſhew us, that God could give light to the world without a Sunne. Thus it is alſo in ſpiritual things, though God could otherwiſe communicate his graces, yet he hath pleaſed to appoint this ordinary way: So that there is no expectation of the Spirit, but in the Word, as the Word can no wayes avail without the Spirit, and it's the goodneſs of God that he hath commanded all ſpirits to be tried by this Rule, and if not conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it, to reject them, which could not be, if the voice of the Spirit could be heard any other way, but in and by the Scriptures, we then are bound to come to this pool; if we will have the divine moving not of an Angel, but of the Spirit of God. As the <hi>Iſraelite</hi> that would eſcape death was to keep within his doors, and thoſe within the Ark, who would enjoy Gods Protection. Thus muſt ſuch keep within the bounds of the Scripture, who expect Gods Spirit to guide them. But although we are thus bound to expect Sanctification onely in this means, yet we cannot ſay, that God hath bound himſelf to work theſe effects alwayes, for though he will not ordinarily diſpenſe his grace, but in this way, yet he will not alwayes accompany this way, yea it's the ſavour of death to many, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2 16.</p>
            <p>Hence in the ſeventh place, <hi>The word of God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The word to ſome through their wickednes becomes an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of greater ſinfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</note> 
               <hi>though it be</hi> ex ſe <hi>and</hi> quoad in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutionem, <hi>an inſtrument of Sanctification, yet to ſome accidentally through their corruption, it becomes an inſtrument of greater ſinfulneſſe and wickedneſſe</hi> So that commonly there are no greater ſinners under Heaven, then in the Church, and in the Church none greater then where the beſt and moſt powerfull means of grace are. It was thus with the Jews, <hi>Col.</hi> 6. who enjoyed beſides the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Miniſtry of their Prieſts, the inſtructions of extraordinary Prophets, and yet the truth of God did not ſanctifie them; <hi>But go</hi> (ſaith God to the Prophet) <hi>make their eyes blinde, and their hearts hard</hi>; and this our Saviour did apply to their poſterity alſo, who enjoyed Chriſt himſelf, and ſaw all the wonderfull mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles he did. This is a dreadfull and terrible thing to conſider of, when in ſtead of ſanctifying, God ſhall ſay, Harden them, blinde them, and make them more wicked by the truth. It's not the Word worketh thus of it ſelf, but wicked hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:65216:256"/>
through their unbelief, and unprofitableneſs, provoke God to give them up to believe a lie; and for the abuſe of heavenly light, they are given up to vile affections, <hi>To many curſed ſins, which is a greater judgment then to be caſt into the mouth of wilde beaſts, for they will only devoure the body, but theſe will damn the ſoul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of Direction</hi> to all the people of God, whoſe burden and grief it is, that they have no more holineſs, who cry out like the horſleech, <hi>It's not enough,</hi> and their ſouls refuſe all comfort, becauſe they cannot climb up this hill to Heaven faſter; let ſuch be directed to take the right way; How willingly is the earthly man ready to hear how he may get more wealth? and the languiſhing man, how he may get more health and ſtrength? Why then ſhouldſt not thou rejoyce to know which is the way to purifie the heart more? Few know the divine efficacy of Gods Word, but ſuch who ſet themſelves to get the vertue of it. And that this may be inſtrumentall to your Sanctification,</p>
            <p>In the firſt place, Remember faith, without which it can do no more good then excellent medicines, if they be not applied, ſet faith a work, and then the word of God will powerfully work upon thee. It's with thee as thou believeſt. Believe, and thoſe high mountains of luſts ſhall be thrown down.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Bring an humble, tender and trembling heart at the teaching of it. Such an heart King <hi>Joſias</hi> had, and he is commended for it, yea <hi>Ezra</hi> 9.4. it's the character of the godly to tremble at his Word. The hard heart, no more then the hard Rock, can receive the ſeed ſown into it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It's not enough to receive the Word of God at firſt, but keep it there. The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> cals it, <hi>the ingraffed Word,</hi> the Word that turneth us into the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of it, that we are walking Bibles, as great Schollers are called walking Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braries. <hi>David</hi> ſaid, <hi>He had hid Gods word in his heart</hi>; This is the leaven that will diffuſe it ſelf.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Reſt not in the bare hearing, but joyn earneſt and fervent prayer, that the Spirit of God may teach inwardly, while the Word doth outwardly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. <hi>Of Inſtruction,</hi> How terrible a thing it is to ſee men grow more wicked and ungodly, by how much the more plentifully they enjoy the Word, that the Word ſhould work contrary to it's nature upon thee, that this light ſhould put out thy eyes, that this life ſhould bring thee to death? Oh the rivers of water that ſhould run out of our eyes for this matter, and yet is there any more common judgment then this! Oh bewail and cry out for fear of it, Lord every thing I take doth me more hurt!</p>

            </p>
            <p>Sometimes God did govern his Church by his Word as revealed only; Thus it was with the Church at firſt, In this latter Age he guides it by the Scriptures only; There is no other Word of God, but what is written; In Chriſts time there was both, for there were the Books of the Old Teſtament, and they were Gods written Word, and what Chriſt while on the Earth did with his own mouth ſpeak to the Church, that was the Revealed Word and Will of God; We reade not that Chriſt wrote any thing but once upon the Ground, and what that was, though there are many and ſeverall Conjectures, yet none can certainly tell: But what Chriſt ſpake and did, the Evangeliſts afterwards being guided infallibly by the divine Spirit of God, did commit to Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting;</p>

            <p>Some indeed by <hi>Word</hi> underſtand Chriſt, and it's true that Chriſt is the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential Word of God, and ſo alſo the Eſſential Truth, but the Context doth evidence it, that he ſpeaks of the <hi>Revealed</hi> and <hi>Preached</hi> Word: Now this is called Gods Word, becauſe whether immediately delivered by God; or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded

to be written, It's ſtill Gods Word, Speaking and Writing are but accidentall to it: It's the ſame Eſſentiall Word, as it is the ſame man, though he alter his Garment, and the ſame wine though put in divers Veſſels: The Word of God written ought with as much Faith and Reverence to be received, as if God did immediately ſpeak it from Heaven, and though it ſeem incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, yet our Saviour confirmeth it, <hi>Luke</hi> 16.31. that he who doth not beleeve the Scriptures, the Word of God written would not beleeve though there were miraculous waies of publiſhing it.</p>
            <p>In the next place we have the <hi>Predicate, its Truth</hi>; Interpreters judge this to be taken out of the <hi>Pſalm</hi> 119.151. They are therefore ſaid to be <hi>Truth,</hi> not true in the Abſtract, to ſhew the Fulneſſe and Univerſality of Truth in them.</p>

            <p>We take it for a principle granted by Chriſtians, that the Word of God is true, and although Learned men have by unanſwerable Arguments demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated the Truth of the Scriptures, yet that was to Heathens and Pagans, or that were not Beleevers of it; It is true the work is neceſſary alſo to thoſe that are Chriſtians, to make their faith more ſolid, certain, and clear, and the rather becauſe there are ſome wretched men roſe up of late that cry down the Scriptures, and that pretend to be above them, yea, that bid us prove the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures to be Gods Word, but I am not to deal with ſuch at this time, Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly every good Chriſtian having received this principle into him, doth finde ſuch authority and Divine Majeſty coming from the Word, that he doth no more deſire Arguments to prove the Scripture to be the Word of God, then he would have another Sunne to ſee this Sunne-ſhine: <hi>Auſtin</hi> long agoe ſpeaks of ſuch a diſpoſition with great Indignation, O Lord, Thou haſt taught me to abhorre all ſuch who ſay,<note place="margin">In how many particulars Gods Word is true.</note>

Truth, <hi>To the Law, and to the Teſtimony, if they ſpeak not according to this, it is becauſe there is no light in them,</hi> Iſaiah 8.20.

Qualitatively.</note> Truth is an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection cleaving to a Propoſition, and thus the Word of God is true qualita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, yea, the Truth of the Scripture is affirmed by all to be more firm and ſtrong (though not ſo evident) then any thing in the world: Thoſe things we receive by <hi>Reaſon</hi> or by <hi>Sence,</hi> are nothing ſo true and firm as thoſe that we receive by Faith: It is ſaid indeed, that all Truth conſiſts <hi>in indiviſibili,</hi> and ſo nothing can be truer then another; This is graeted in reſpect of Truth it ſelf, But then if you do regard the Foundation, or the Cauſe of Truth, ſo is one more certain then another; Thus all the Truths of Faith are tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant to thoſe of Reaſon and Sence; We are more ſecurely to reſt in what God ſaith then in what we know or feel, and the reaſon is becauſe the Truth of theſe latter things is founded only upon a Creature, but of the former up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Creator, upon God himſelf: Oh that we did thus beleeve Gods word! what manner of perſons ſhould we be; who could terrifie the Godly? who could trouble their Spirits, if this were received? And for the wicked, with what Fear and Trembling would he go up and down? Oh the Scripture is true that ſpeaks againſt ſuch ſins, that diſcovers my wickedneſs, it is ſo true I cannot deny it.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, It is true <hi>Inſtrumentally,</hi> Becauſe the Spirit of God directs us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all Truth, and this is chiefly the intendment here;<note place="margin">V. It's true In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentally.</note> The Scripture is in Gods hand, and by the Spirits working leadeth us into all Truth, we are all in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe till the Scripture like the Sunne doth ariſe; Man liveth in Errours, he
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:65216:258"/>
is nothing but a Lye, till the Scripture inform, but though the Scripture doth ſhine, yet as the Sunne cannot make a blinde man to ſee, ſo neither doth the Scripture of it ſelf, till God give a Seeing Eye.</p>
            <p>The Scripture works onely <hi>Objectively,</hi> but the Spirit of God <hi>Subjectively,</hi> preparing and fitting a man by it; So that as to an Archer there are two things that are neceſſary, The Mark to aim at, and an Eye to ſee: What could an Archer do without Eyes? Thus it is with us in all our Actions: The Scripture that is the Mark, and therefore Sinne is called <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it miſſeth of the Mark, and then the Spirit of God that muſt give the Eye, Light, and Wiſedome unto the Underſtanding: The Scripture then is Truth, becauſe by it Gods Spirit doth direct and leade us into all Truth.</p>

This is the Rule, and ſo what is not according to this muſt be oblique and crooked: Therefore never expect Truth from that man who is not diligent in the Scriptures, the Rule of Truth: This hath been the Cauſe why moſt Heretiques have either accuſed or deſpiſed the Authority of the Scriptures, becauſe they know that this Sunne and their darkneſſe could not conſiſt together; They ſaw their Doctrines, and the Scripture could no more ſtand by each other then the Ark and <hi>Dagon</hi>; Therefore they would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fall out with Scripture then with their own Opinions, as if their own hearts and Conſciences were more infallible then the Bible, and as if they were not to be made conformable unto the Scripture, but the Scripture to them.</p>

We ſee by theſe Texts that there is no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation or true Reformation but what is wrought by and through the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture; Therefore Converſion is called <hi>the writing of Gods Law in a mans heart,</hi> So that this makes it clear, that though many Heretiques may live civil and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally Religious Lives, yet they have no true Godlineſſe, for falſe Doctrine begets falſe Piety, when there is <hi>falſum in Intellectu,</hi> that muſt neceſſarily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce <hi>malum in voluntate</hi>; And the Reaſon is plain, becauſe Godlineſſe is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Truth incorporated, Truth digeſted, Truth put into practiſe; It is Gods Law in the heart (as you heard;) Hence as Poiſon can never nouriſh a man, or afford good Health, So neither can any falſe Doctrine help to any true Piety or Holineſſe: Men may have ſeeming Devotions, but as the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent though it ſhines and gliſters, yet is full of inward Poiſon, ſo whatſoever external Acts of Piety, Zeal and Charity Hereticall men may put forth, yet by them they cannot be Sanctified if their Errours be Fundamental: It was

               <note place="margin">The excellent properties of the truth of Scripture.</note>IN what ſenſe the word of God is ſaid to be truth, we have declared. Let us now come to the <hi>Properties of it.</hi> And</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>It's the truth of God, a divine truth.</hi> In the Text it's called <hi>thy truth</hi>;</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">1. It's the truth of God.</note>So that <hi>Divine Truth</hi> muſt needs tranſcend <hi>Humane</hi> or <hi>Natural Truths,</hi> as much as God is above man. In humane Authorities, we ſay, Thus ſaith <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle,</hi> Thus ſaith <hi>Plato,</hi> or thus ſay ſuch <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Councels,</hi> but in divine things, we muſt ſay, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord</hi>; for becauſe it's divine, or of God, it hath an immediate dominion and awe upon the conſcience: So that whereas in humane Authorities and Philoſophical Diſputes, we may boldly argue againſt them, we may bring our <hi>videtur quod ſic,</hi> and <hi>quod non,</hi> yet where truth comes to us as from God, there muſt be an immediate ſubmiſſion, though our reaſon and ſenſe and all the world ſhould contradict, yet we muſt ſay, here is a greater then a <hi>Pythagoras</hi> here, <hi>Deus dixit:</hi> Therefore obſerve, the Prophets they do often repeat this, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord,</hi> becauſe nothing could amaze and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble their hearers ſo much, as that God ſaid it; and indeed when once it's recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved as Gods truth, then the heart doth readily obey, as 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.13. you may there ſee wherein the truth preached doth work in it's due and proper manner, even when it's received, <hi>not as the word of man, but of God.</hi> Divine truth will have divine operations, but when received as mans truth, it hath but humane effects, ſuch as <hi>Tullies</hi> Orations, or <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> had upon their auditors, which is like the influence of the Moon, that doth not give true heat and life, but the word of God works like the Sun, not only in reſpect of penetrating light, reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into all the inwards of the ſoul, but alſo vivifical heat. It makes men live a ſpiritual and heavenly life, whereas moral truths help only to an external hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty. It's true, that which <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſaid, <hi>Omnis veritas eſt à Spiritu ſancto,</hi> Every truth is of the holy Ghoſt, even natural and humane truths are. But as God is the author of nature, and yet of grace in a more ſpecial way: ſo the Spirit of God is the author of all truth; but in a more peculiar manner of Scripture truths: Therefore all Scripture is ſaid <hi>to be given by inſpiration,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.16. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider then, the truths we deliver you out of Gods word are his truth. Thus ſaith the Lord againſt the heretical perſon, Thus ſaith the Lord againſt the prophane perſon: Oh if it were only men that ſay thus, it might be eaſily rejected, but it's God that ſpeaks it, and therefore none may oppoſe!</p>
            <p n="2">
               <note place="margin">2. It's infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</note>2. Becauſe it's Gods truth, <hi>therefore it's infallible</hi>; it's ſo certain, that we can never be deceived, whoſoever believed according to Scripture, and lived accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Scripture, that a man was never confounded or aſhamed, he will never have cauſe to wiſh, Oh that he had taken another way! Oh that I had done other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe! Thus <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 119. <hi>Then I ſhall not be confounded, when I have reſpect to all thy Commandments.</hi> Have a conſcientious reſpect to Gods Word in thy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:65216:259"/>
and in thy converſation, this will prove infallible, this is the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> cloud, and pillar upon their Tabernacle, we are to go when that goeth, we are to ſtand ſtill, when that ſtands ſtill; This is the Star that will certainly guide us to Chriſt; All divine faith is infallible; in Philoſophy, in humane Authorities we may be deceived, but in the Scripture we cannot. Venture all upon the truth of Scripture, it will never deceive thee, when thou wilt finde Satan and the world liars.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>It's an eternal Truth</hi>; Even as God doth abide for ever, ſo will his truth,<note place="margin">3. Eternal.</note> 
               <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. <hi>Heaven and earth ſhall ſooner paſs away then one iota or tittle of it.</hi> Truth will abide when theſe heavens and earth ſhall not abide at leaſt not in the ſame manner as they are now, and excellently to this purpoſe ſpeaks 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.23, 24, 25. being born of the incorruptible word of God, <hi>for all fleſh is graſs, but the word of God abideth for ever</hi>; and this is the Word which by the Goſpel is preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to you, Scripture-truth abideth for ever, whereas all errours and falſe ways, though they have overflowed for a while, yet preſently they withered again. What is become of the <hi>Manichees, Arrians, Pelagians, Nestorians,</hi> and thoſe thouſands of <hi>Heretiques?</hi> They had a time of glory, a ſhew in the world, but then died, neither lamented nor deſired; Scripture-truth will prevail, even as Chriſt the eſſential Truth. As the Sun will at laſt get the better of all clouds and foggy miſts, and cannot alwayes be in an eclypſe; ſo it's with the truth of God. All errors are like men, mortal, they paſs away; if any error be ſo ſtrong as to hold to threeſcore years, it begins like man to be full of pain and ſorrow; They are compared to hay and ſtubble, theſe will not long continue; They are like <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> rich and great men in the world, like the graſs upon the houſe top, not only <hi>homo,</hi> but <hi>haereticus eſt bulla</hi>; Truth will continue in the field, when all errours will lie proſtrate and conquered, and have no other burial, but that of an Aſs, as that deſpiſed King had.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>It's an univerſal Truth,</hi> within the bounds of Religion; I do not ſay,<note place="margin">4. Univerſal.</note> that all philoſophical and mathematical truths are in the Scripture, but all ſoul-ſaving truths are, as 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. <hi>The Scriptures are able to make thee wiſe to ſalvation.</hi> There is nothing for doctrine, or for practice, but that can guide thee. This ſufficiency and perfection of Scripture-truth, we do juſtly maintain againſt the Papiſts, who as they fooliſhly ſet up their lighted tapers at noon-day, ſo they add their traditions to the Scripture; but it's often ſaid, we may neither adde to it, nor detract from it: therefore it's abundantly ſufficient: Now it's good with <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi> to adore this fulneſs of the Scripture for thy faith and doctrine, to believe as thou readeſt, to worſhip God as thou readeſt: As the childe in the womb is nouriſhed only by the mother, through her nouriſhing: Thus the Church of God is inſtructed, nouriſhed and enlivened only from God by the Scriptures. We read the Manna fell from heaven, but there fell a dew before it to conſtringe and bind the earth: Thus truth fals from God, but the Scripture is like the dew to keep it together, that it may be for our uſe; Let not then tradition, cuſtom, antiquity, multitudes, nor ſuch <hi>Gorgons</hi> heads lifted up by men terrifie thee, but follow the word in thy faith and worſhip, where that ſtands ſtill, do not thou go further, where that goeth, do not thou ſtand ſtill. And as for faith, ſo for thy life, know that hath all practical truth in it, neceſſary to ſalvation, that teacheth, and that only, how to repent, how to be converted, how to believe in Chriſt, how to pray, how to hear, how to be in the world, yet to have a converſation in heaven. That teacheth thee how to be godly in thy relations, a godly father, a godly childe, a godly maſter, a godly ſervant. Now this moſt people are greatly faulty in, they will be of no Religion, but what the Scripture commands, yet they will live other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, and do otherwiſe. When thou ſeeſt an heretick thou will bring Scripture againſt him; And is not Scripture againſt thy prophaneneſs and impiety? as well as there are damnable hereſies, ſo are there damnable wickedneſſes in mens lives.</p>

               <note place="margin">5. Supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall.</note>5. <hi>It's a ſupernatural Truth.</hi> Many of the truths revealed in Scripture are ſuch, as no <hi>Plato's,</hi> no <hi>Ariſtotles,</hi> no wiſdom of man, though raiſed beyond <hi>Solomons,</hi> could ever have attained unto, ſuch as the <hi>doctrine of the Trinity, of the Nature, Perſon, and Office of Chriſt, of the Reſurrection, of a day of Judgment, and the ſtate of men afterwards.</hi> The former of theſe eſpecially could never be diſcovered by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural light; even <hi>Adam</hi> though created after Gods image, yet needed a revelation of theſe. We have no innate or acquired knowledge about them, and though ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny worthy Divines have indeavoured to prove the <hi>Trinity</hi> by reaſon and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ſimilitudes, yet the ſureſt and moſt evident way is the Scripture; ſo that we may ſay of them all, which <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſpeaks of one of them, <hi>viz. Of Chriſts being God and man, If you can give a reaſon, it would not be</hi> mirabile, <hi>and if an example, it would not be</hi> ſingulare. It's true, there are many things in Scripture, which we know by natural reaſon, as that there is a God, but the knowledge by reaſon is nothing ſo evident and firm, as that by Revelation; ſo that the truth of God, being in the chiefeſt parts of it ſupernatural: It's no wonder, that the wiſeſt Heathens <hi>became vain in their imaginations,</hi> and that their greateſt Religion, was their higheſt impiety, and within the Church. The more men have forſaken Scripture, and pleaſed corrupt reaſon in the doctrinal part, and corrupt fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies in the worſhipping part; They have been very erroneous and abſurd; hence the truth of God is called a <hi>myſtery,</hi> and ſaid to be <hi>revealed,</hi> becauſe mans rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon could no more attain unto it, then a dwarf can reach to the heavens, <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus</hi> muſt get upon this Tree to ſee Chriſt: Hence no others have been able to endure the glorious luſtre of the Scripture, becauſe errours are natural, the Scripture ſupernatural. All hereſies have runne up and down from one age to another, like <hi>Cain</hi> fearing leaſt every Text of Scripture ſhould kill them: Do not then judge of Scripture-truths by thy carnal reaſon? The work is above thy na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural underſtanding.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <note place="margin">6. A holy truth</note>6. <hi>It's a godly holy Truth</hi>; The <hi>holy</hi> Scriptures they are called, and well may they be ſo called, for nothing is a ſtronger argument to demonſtrate the Divine Authority of Scriptures, than the holineſs thereof. Take all the moral books in the world, they do as much come ſhort of the holineſs of the Scripture, as coals do of the glory of the Sunne. <hi>Plutarch, Seneca, Epictetus,</hi> theſe will teach you to have the clean skin of morality, but not the inward life and ſound vitals of holineſs; What tranſcendent holineſs doth the Scripture teach us? ſuch as the men of the world know not; Holineſs in our natures, firſt of all, <hi>Regeneration,</hi> neither the name nor the nature of it, was known amongſt the Heathens, they knew not mans natural pollution, neither did they ſee a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of ſuch an internal renovation.</p>
            <p>Again, <hi>Such holy duties the Scriptures teach, that not only the doctrinal, but the practical part of it, is a myſtery to fleſh and bloud, ſuch are faith in Chriſt, love to our enemies, ſelf-denial, and a readineſſe to take up the Croſſe.</hi> Many of theſe duties are accounted folly and madneſs by wiſe men after the fleſh. It teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth an heavenly life, fellowſhip and communion with God, to do all things from holy principles, and to holy ends; ſo that the holineſſe that is in the truth of Scriptures ſhould much affect us. But oh how few reade and delight in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, becauſe of the holineſſe in them? You reade them for diſpute, or to know the Hiſtory, and to be able to hold up Arguments; but who is there, that thinketh this, the truths of Scripture are holy? They are to make heavenly and pure, they will forewarn of ſin, they quicken to grace, they inflame to faith and love: Oh minde this, all Scripture-truth is for holineſs! As meat is not to be looked upon, but eaten and digeſted.</p>
            <p n="7">
               <note place="margin">7. A precious truth.</note>7. <hi>They are precious excellent Truths,</hi> and therefore compared by <hi>David</hi> to <hi>fine gold,</hi> and by <hi>Solomon preferred above all jewels,</hi> Prov. 3.15. The Apoſtle alſo compareth true Doctrine <hi>to gold, ſilver and precious ſtones,</hi> 1 Cor. 3.12.
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:65216:260"/>
and they are called <hi>precious promiſes,</hi> as a <hi>precious faith,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.1, 4. Theſe ſhew in what high degree and dignity the truths of Scripture ſhould be with us. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaid, <hi>Veritas Chriſtianorum</hi> was <hi>incomparabiliter pulchrior Helenâ Graecorum</hi>; If they did ſtrive about her, How much more ought we for the truth of God? The Prophet complained of old, <hi>None pleaded for the truth, Iſa</hi> 59 4. neither were <hi>valiant for the truth,</hi> Jer. 9.3. The truths then of the Scripture ſhould be more unto us, then any earthly comforts whatſoever: You ſee Chriſt makes this one main end of his coming into the world, <hi>to bear witneſs unto the truth,</hi> John 18 37. Ann thus the Martyrs, they thought Gods truth more worth then their lives, and how many millions have willingly endured the worſt of deaths, to bear witneſs to the truths of the Scripture? So that it's ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſtrange, how ſuch a ſpirit of deluſion ſhould be upon men, to make no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of true Doctrine, to think Hereſies and Errours are nothing. Certainly, the godly Martyrs, that burnt at the ſtake, had other thoughts of it; and the Scripture doth commend it as the great mercy of God unto a people: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God promiſeth <hi>Jer.</hi> 33.6. <hi>He will reveal abundance of peace and truth</hi>; and in many places, truth is ſtill joyned unto peace, as if all the peace and earthly advantages in the world were nothing, if we might not have the truths of God alſo. Therefore the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> told that elect Lady, <hi>He had no greater joy, then to ſee her children walking in the truth</hi>; and the Spirit of God is promiſed, as the greateſt mercy we can have, <hi>John</hi> 16.13. <hi>That he will guide us into all truth.</hi> Natural truth is precious, What pains and travel have many uſed to finde that out? They have diſpoſſeſſed themſelves of their goods to finde it out; yea they have been ſo raviſhed in the contemplation thereof, that they have forgotten to eat their bread, and have wholly neglected themſelves, and all pleaſure. Hence in their Sacrifices to <hi>Apollo,</hi> whom the Heathens made God of truth, they cried out, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>Truth is ſweet, Truth is ſweet.</hi> Truth is the natural food to the ſoul, as meat is to the body; but then divine ſupernatural truth, which doth ſo immediately concern our ſalvation and eternal happineſs, how precious and dear ſhould that be to us? In other things ignorance is not damnable, but here to miſſe of the truth is to fall into deſtruction. It profits not a man to meaſure the heavens and the motions there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. To underſtand all the Laws of Nations, with their caſes thereupon; or with <hi>Solomon,</hi> to be able to ſpeak of the nature of all things, if a man want the knowledge of Scripture-truths.</p>

Thus Chriſt <hi>John</hi> 8.40. told the Phariſees, <hi>They thought to kill him, becauſe he told them the truth.</hi> And <hi>Paul, Gal.</hi> 4.16. <hi>Am I become your enemy, becauſe I tell you the truth?</hi> The Miniſters of this truth are compared to light that is offenſive to ſore eyes, and ſalt that doth grieve and vex the wounded man. Indeed truth, if rightly conſidered, is not grievous, but to do otherwiſe then obey truth. It's not the threatning of hell and damnation, that ſhould be ſo grievous, but the puniſhments them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.

            <p>THis Verſe begins a New Argument or Reaſon why the Apoſtles need Sanctification by the Truth; It's drawn not from the generall Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration as they are Beleevers, but from the particular Relation they were in, commiſſionated with Office to preach the Truth of God.</p>
            <p>Before I enter upon the words, the Coherence of this Argument with the Petition doth deſerve ſome Conſideration, though the particle of Connexion be not expreſſed, yet it is to be ſuppoſed, howſoever this followeth next in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der upon that Petition, and therefore there cannot be but Coherence of the matter.</p>

The Scripture compareth the Miniſters of God to Stars, and that both for their light and purity, differing (as Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers ſay) from the ſubſtance of ſublunary things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Let us Conſider the Grounds why they are to be endowed with Truth,<note place="margin">Why it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ſhould be endowed with ſoundneſſe of judgement.</note> and to have a ſound minde.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> And firſt, <hi>From the Quality of the Office</hi>; Their Office is to preach the Truth; They are appointed to declare the Word of God, and that only not humane Inventions, not the thoughts of their own heart, for if Chriſt himſelf avouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth this, that <hi>his doctrine was not his own, but his that ſent him,</hi> and doth ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre all to the Father that ſent him, how much more ought the Miniſters of God to declare what they reade, and what they have received of God by the Scriptures, not their own conceits; Thus the Prophets of old began their Sermons with <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord,</hi> and the Apoſtles begin their Epiſtles with their call and office, <hi>Apoſtles and Servants of God</hi>; Seeing therefore they have ſuch an Office and Truſt that requireth in the very Eſſentials of it nothing but Truth, they ought earneſtly to pray for it; They are called the <hi>Light</hi> and the <hi>Salt of the Earth</hi>; Now if the Light be dark all the body is dark; If Salt hath loſt his Seaſoning, it's good for nothing; By their Office they are to be the Miniſters of Truth, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>I can do nothing againſt the Truth, but for it,</hi> 2 Corinth. 13.8. This is a Miniſter after Gods own Heart that is thus qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> Secondly, Truth is neceſſary if you do reſpect the <hi>ſubordination of their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice</hi>; Chriſt hath not ſent them to be Maſters and Lords over mens Faith, to propound their own Dictates, and to anathematize ſuch as do not immediatly obey, No, They have a <hi>Miniſteriall</hi> not a <hi>Magisteriall Office,</hi> for though in reſpect of the people they are <hi>Guides</hi> and <hi>Overſeers,</hi> and <hi>Shepheards,</hi> yet in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of God they are Miniſters and Servants; They are under Chriſt the Head, and ſo muſt not deliver any thing but what they have received; They may not make Articles of Faith, they cannot appoint the worſhip of God, They cannot inſtitute new Sacraments: It's ſpiritual Treaſon in them to do: this They are like the skillfull Gemmary that doth not make the Jewell, only by his skill doth diſcover which is true, or like <hi>Solomon</hi> that did not make the true Childe, but by his Wiſedom did manifeſt it, So the Miniſters of the Goſpel though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo Learned, never ſo holy, yet they of their own authority cannot make any new Truth or new Ordinance, Therefore they are compared to <hi>Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors</hi> that are bound up by their Commiſſion; To <hi>Stewards</hi> not Maſters in the Houſe; The Scripture is called Gods <hi>Testament</hi> or <hi>Will,</hi> Now the Lawyer may not adde or take away from it, though he hath never ſo much skill and knowledge, it would be ſinful forgery in him to do ſo; Thus Beloved, we Miniſters are bound up to Gods Word as that laſt Will: he hath appointed how he will have his Church governed, how it muſt beleeve, how it muſt worſhip, and it muſt be high Sacriledge to adde or detract from it; Therefore if Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture-Truths be thought too much above Reaſon; if they be thought too ſtrict or preciſe, to contrary to fleſh and bloud, blame not us; It's not our truth, we did not make the Bible, It's not our Scripture.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> Thirdly, Truth is neceſſary to them, if you do regard the <hi>Effects of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry,</hi> or the Ends why God hath appointed it, and certainly the Sunne may as well be without Light and Heat, as the Miniſters of the Goſpel be without Truth.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> One main effect is <hi>Converſion</hi> and <hi>Regeneration</hi>; to make men reform their lives upon juſt and holy Grounds.

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. Another Effect of the Miniſtry is to <hi>promote the work of grace begun</hi>; It's to water where any Seed is ſown, as <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.11. to bring us <hi>to a full ſtature in Chriſt</hi>; Now a Miniſter without Truth can no more help forward the growth of the Godly then a dead Mother can nurſe her Childe; We encreaſe in grace, by the ſame way we are converted, and therefore they who think by an erroneous Miniſtry to advance their Heavenly Life, do as if an hungry man ſhould get up to an high Hill, and think by ſwallowing down the winde to live and grow ſtronger.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> A Third Effect of the Miniſtry is to <hi>direct and guide the tempted and troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Soul, to speak a word in ſeaſon to him</hi>; But now a Miniſter without Truth is like a Phyſician without skill, Come to the diſeaſed wounded Soul that lieth under this doubt and that Caſe of Conſcience, he knoweth not how to direct him, yea, ſuch do more trouble the godly, as God complaineth of the Falſe Prophets, <hi>Eze.</hi> 13.22. <hi>they made ſad the heart of the Righteous,</hi> whom God would not have made ſad.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 4. A great Effect of the Miniſtry is to <hi>prevent Errors and falſe Doctrines,</hi> at appeareth, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. <hi>That we henceforth be not led aſide with every winde of doctrine</hi>; Men deſtitute of ſolid grace are as apt to be carried away with errours, as chaff with the winde; A ſound Miniſtry is appointed to reprove theſe, as the Sun is to diſpell darkneſſe, but if the Miniſter be ſeduced himſelf by errour, how can he leade others into the Truth? Will not our Saviours Proverb be made good, <hi>the blinde leade the blinde, and both fall into the ditch</hi>; Thus you ſee the neceſſity of Truth.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Why Miniſters muſt be holy.</note>In the next place there muſt be <hi>Thummim</hi> as well as the <hi>

            <p n="2">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. <hi>In reſpect of others,</hi> For a godly life is a Teſtimony to confirm the Truth we preach, when we preach there is a God, there is a day of judgement, and live ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, this confirmeth to all, that we our ſelves beleeve it to be a Truth, an holy life is like a miracle to confirm our doctrine; As the Apoſtles were endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Miracles to eſtabliſh the Truth they preached, they could caſt out de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, tread upon Serpents, and take no hurt, if they did eat any deadly thing; Thus it is a wonderfull thing to confirm the Truths we preach, when though we live in the temptations of ſinne, and tread upon Serpents, yet acquire no ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual hurt to our ſouls.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3 <hi>Our holy life will awe and keep in fear the Conſciences of wicked men</hi>; Not only powerful and ſound preaching but conſciencious and unblamable living will awe mens Conſciences; Why did <hi>Herod</hi> fear and reverence <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> though he was a King? but becauſe he was a juſt and a holy man, <hi>Mark</hi> 6.20.

            <p>HAving conſidered of the Coherence of this Text with the preceding. We come now to the <hi>Argument,</hi> or <hi>Matter itſelf,</hi> and that is taken from the peculiar Relation and Office, that they are put in.</p>
            <p>Now this their Office is deſcribed,</p>
            <p n="1">1. From the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Quality</hi> of it, It's a <hi>ſending.</hi> They did not of themſelves intrude into it, or goe without a Call, but they were ſent.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There is the <hi>Efficient Cauſe,</hi> or the <hi>Perſon ſending, I ſent them</hi> (ſaith Chriſt.)</p>
            <p n="3">3. There is the <hi>Subject, who were ſent,</hi> and that is the <hi>Diſciples.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. The <hi>Term</hi> to which, of their ſending, and that is <hi>into the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, Here is the <hi>Example</hi> and <hi>Patern, Even as the Father ſent me into the world.</hi> Not that there is the ſame likeneſſe in every particular, but in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, they both agree in this, that they have a Call from God.</p>
            <p>I ſhall treat in order, and firſt begin with Chriſts <hi>miſſion,</hi> which is made the <hi>Patern</hi> of the Apoſtles, and do obſerve,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That Chriſt was ſent of the Father, and did not of himſelf undertake that Office,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Obſerv.</hi> Chriſt was ſent of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and did not of himſelf undertake that office; he was imployed in, while on the earth.</note> 
               <hi>he was imployed in, while on earth.</hi> Chriſt himſelf would not be the Prophet, Prieſt or King of his Church without a Call, or Commiſſion from the Father thereunto. Hence in <hi>John</hi>'s Goſpel, he doth ſo exceeding often mention this, <hi>That his Father ſent him,</hi> ſtill reſolving his Doctrine, his Authority, his Will and Works <hi>into him that ſent him.</hi> Therefore not only the twelve Apoſtles are called ſo, but Chriſt himſelf is called an <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> Heb. 3.1 <hi>Conſider the Apoſtle and High-prieſt of our profeſſion, Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> An Apoſtle is as much as one that is <hi>ſent</hi>; and thus Chriſt is there called an Apoſtle; and therefore ſome make a myſtery in that <hi>John</hi> 9.7. when Chriſt cured the blinde man, he bids him, <hi>Goe and waſh in the pool of Siloam,</hi> which is by interpretation <hi>ſent,</hi> ſaith the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt, as if hereby our Saviour would teach, that he was the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> that was to be ſent into the world. That our Saviour did expect a ſending, or a Call, appeareth notably <hi>Heb.</hi> 5 4. <hi>No man taketh this honour upon himſelf, but he that is called,</hi> ſpeaking of the Prieſthood;<note place="margin">Of Chriſts Commiſſion conſider theſe things.</note> and ſo alſo Chriſt glorified not himſelf to be made an High-prieſt.</p>
            <p>But let us explain this, for this truth is profitable unto us, ſeeing it was for us, that he was ſent. And</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Conſider, that though the three Perſons are equal in Nature and Dignity,</hi>
               <pb n="488" facs="tcp:65216:264"/>
they are all God and infinitely bleſſed for evermore, <hi>yet the Scripture doth repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent unto us an order in their operations</hi> ad extra <hi>to us-ward, eſpecially in the work of our Redemption, one operation is appropriated to the Father, another to the Son, and another to the holy Ghoſt.</hi> To the Father is conſtantly applied the <hi>ſending</hi> of Chriſt his Sonne into the world, as at the ſecond verſe of this Chapter, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4. <hi>In the fulneſs of time God ſent forth his Son</hi>; and 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.9. it's the <hi>Father that ſends him:</hi> So that the original of all our peace and ſalvation is the love of the Father.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That which is appropriated to the <hi>Sonne,</hi> is to be <hi>ſent</hi>; To be the Perſon that ſhall procure our Redemption. And</p>
            <p n="3">3. To the <hi>holy Ghoſt,</hi> that he is <hi>ſent</hi> both by the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Son,</hi> for the application of thoſe benefits which he ſhall procure for us: Therefore the Father is ſaid to <hi>ſend him,</hi> Joh. 14.16. and Chriſt ſaith, <hi>He will ſend him,</hi> Joh. 16 7. Thus he is called, <hi>The Spirit of Chriſt,</hi> as well as <hi>the ſpirit of God,</hi> becauſe now he is ſent by Chriſt as a Mediator. The holineſs in <hi>Adam</hi> was wrought by the Spirit of God, as the third Perſon in the Trinity, abſolutely conſidered, but now it cauſeth holineſs in believers, relatively as the Spirit of Chriſt; So that in Gods diſpenſations about mans ſalvation, there is an appropriated order in the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the three Perſons.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> Secondly, <hi>The miſſion or ſending of Chriſt here ſpoken of, doth not relate to him, as the ſecond Perſon, but as he is Mediator, for ſo as he is the Son of God, he is not ſent but begotten,</hi> And thus the Scripture when it ſpeaks of him in that reſpect, calleth him, <hi>The only begotten Son of God</hi>; but this miſſion is in time, and of a voluntary diſpenſation, whereas the other was natural and of eternity, Chriſt was alwayes the Sonne of God, but not alwayes ſent to be the Mediatour of his Church, unleſs in the purpoſe and decree of God: So that this ſending of Chriſt reſpects him as <hi>God and man,</hi> and denoteth that incarnation of his, with the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of all thoſe duties, that thereby he undertook.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> Thirdly, <hi>Gods ſending of him, doth ſignifie the authoritative Miſſion and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of him to that work.</hi> The Apoſtle diligently preſſeth this, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.5. that Chriſt glorified not himſelf, but was called by God to his Prieſthood, <hi>called of God to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Prieſt after the order of Melohiſedech</hi>; yea <hi>Ch.</hi> 7.21. the Apoſtle preſſeth this, that he was made an <hi>High-prieſt by an oath, The Lord ſware, and will not repent, thou art a Prieſt for ever:</hi> And certainly, this muſt needs be of great comfort to us, when we ſhall reade that Chriſt was ſo ſolemnly inveſted with this power to forgive ſins, to ſanctifie our natures, to procure our ſalvation. Things that are done by thoſe that have not a Call, are ſaid to be null and invalid, they have not powerful efficacy and ſucceſs, but Chriſt was authorized by God to be thy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, he had his Commiſſion to do it, he would not take this work in hand, till he was called unto it.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/> Fourthly, <hi>The Father did not only call him thus to this wonderfull imployment, but he did qualifie and fit him with all abilities for that work, he poured out his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit upon his humane nature without meaſure.</hi> So that as thoſe in the Old Teſtament, when called to any Office were anointed: Thus Chriſt had not a temporal, but a ſpiritual Unction, <hi>Pſal</hi> 45.7. there God is ſaid <hi>to anoint him with the oyl of glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>; Therefore <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.27. the Father is ſaid to have <hi>ſealed him</hi> to this work. Thus Chriſt acknowledgeth, when he ſaith, <hi>a body thou haſt prepared for me</hi>; the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, he had an univerſal fitneſs for the work; and this alſo is of great comfort, that Chriſt is not only called to be our Saviour, but he is qualified with all ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency thereunto; there is nothing that a poor humbled ſinner could deſire in a Saviour, but there is a treaſury of it in him, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. <hi>It pleaſed the Father that in him ſhould all fulneſs dwell:</hi> Oh then, why do not the people of God believe more firmly, and walk more comfortably? What do they want, which is not in this Chriſt? Shall Chriſt ſend his Officers to work, and endue them with propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:65216:264"/>
power, and ſhall not the Father ſend him with all fitneſs and fulneſs to that work?</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/> Fifthly, <hi>In that Chriſt is ſaid to be ſent, there is implied, that the fountain from which our ſalvation doth ariſe, is the meer good-will and pleaſure of God the Father.</hi> So that although our Juſtification, Sanctification and Glorification be to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to the merits of Chriſt, and it's for Chriſts ſake that we enjoy them, yet the ſending of Chriſt into the world, and giving him to become our Mediator, is wholly from the abſolute good pleaſure of God; Chriſt did not merit his Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, he did not merit that he ſhould be ſent into the world: No, this is ſaid to be Gods love; Not that hereby we are to make compariſons, as if the ſecond Perſon loved us leſſe then the firſt, as the <hi>Socinian</hi> would divide, but to admire the great love of either in their diſtinct operations. That conceit alſo is vain of ſome, that ſay, God upon the fore ſight of the will of Chriſts humane nature, to become our Saviour, and preſuppoſing this determinate choice, did therefore appoint him to be our Mediator: This, they think, will reconcile Chriſts neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Obedience, and his free-will together; but then the Scripture would not have attributed it to Gods love, and to the Fathers love, but Chriſts love as a man, which yet it doth not.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VI"/> Sixthly, <hi>In that Chriſt is ſaid to be ſent, there is implied, that he is under an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and Obligation of faithfulneſs and truſt.</hi> So that as it lay upon the Apoſtles faithfully and diligently to accompliſh their Office; thus alſo it did upon Chriſt, and therefore he doth ſo often call it the <hi>command,</hi> that he had from the Father, implying, that if he did not accompliſh all that for which he was ſent, he ſhould be guilty of unfaithfulneſs and diſobedience; and here alſo is contained much conſolation; for why ſhould the believer doubt of Chriſts willingneſs and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs to pardon, ſanctifie or heal him, ſeeing that Chriſt is under a command to do this, he is betruſted with this work, he would be found blame-worthy, if he did not accompliſh all that he was call'd unto? As it's thy duty to believe in him, ſo he hath voluntaily ſubmitted, to make it his duty, to give thee reſt and eaſe.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VII"/> Seventhly, <hi>Though Chriſt be ſent, and be thus under command, yet we are not to think that this is done againſt his will, as if the Father did compell him to this work againſt his deſire:</hi> No, how readily doth he profeſs his coming into the world, <hi>Loe, I come to do thy will, O Lord, thy Law is within my heart?</hi> Pſal. 40.8. So that though the work was bitter to the humane nature, which appeared in thoſe pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers he poured forth with ſo much agony, <hi>If it be poſſible, let this Cup paſs away,</hi> yet he offers himſelf with all willingneſs to do this work: Oh no wonder, if this diſpenſation be called a myſtery, not only in reſpect of the revelation of it, but alſo, becauſe of the incomprehenſibleneſs of it, we are never able to comprehend this length, and breadth, and depth of love which is in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VIII"/> Eighthly, <hi>We may conſider of a two-fold Office Chriſt was ſent to, which yet cannot be well diſtinguiſhed, becauſe one is contained in the other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>There is the Office of a Mediator,</hi> whereby he was ſent to be a Saviour of his people from their ſins; and this is the ſending the Scripture ſo much ſpeaks of.</p>
            <p>But 2. <hi>There is a ſending as a Prophet, to teach and guide his Church,</hi> and of this kinde of ſending the text ſpeaks; for we may not think that this is the meaning, that as the Father ſent Chriſt to redeem the world and purge it from it's iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, ſo the Apoſtles were alſo ſent to be Redeemers and Saviours; but as Chriſt was to be the great Prophet, whom the Father would ſend to be a light to the world, ſo he did appoint the Apoſtles, as ſubordinate lights, to take away the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and prophaneneſs that was in it. Chriſt then is ſent as the great Doctor and Teacher of his Church, who doth not only externally teach, but internally, by giving a ſeeing eye, and an underſtanding heart.</p>
            <p>Theſe things are implied in Chriſts Miſſion, now let us conſider the Properties of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="490" facs="tcp:65216:265"/>
               <note place="margin">The neceſſity of Chriſts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſent.</note>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> And firſt, <hi>Take notice of the neceſſity of it.</hi> Had not the Father ſent his Son in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world, there had been no difference between the damned Angels and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde: The world had been an hell, though the world had many <hi>Platoes</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtotles,</hi> many <hi>Alexanders</hi> and <hi>Caeſars,</hi> yet all this is nothing, if Chriſt had not been ſent into the world: Oh then, look upon this, as the foundation of all truth and conſolation, Chriſt is ſent into the world! We could not have had a drop of comfort, any more then <hi>Dives</hi> in hell a drop of water, had not Chriſt been ſent into the world.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. <hi>The mercy, grace and goodneſs of God, that it was his only begotten Sonne he ſent.</hi> He ſent Prophets, and he ſent divers Meſſengers, but never was ſuch mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, as when he ſent his Son, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. The very <hi>Angels,</hi> though the benefit of his ſending did not directly belong to them, yet for this they ſing, <hi>Glory be to God on high, on earth peace, and good-will towards men.</hi> Though God is good in giving food and raiment, in creating the world for us, yet all come ſhort of ſending his Sonne to us.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. <hi>Chriſts Miſſion is the original and root of all the Church Miſſion that is. As the Father hath ſent me, ſo I have ſent you.</hi> So that Chriſt being ſent, is thereby made the head of his Church; all Church-power is ſeated in him, as the original, and therefore all the Miſſions of Church-officers now, is reduced to this, as the fountain of all; Therefore they are <hi>the Miniſters of Chriſt, the Embaſſadours of Chriſt,</hi> they adminiſter all things in <hi>his Name,</hi> and every thing is done by his Authority. It's diſputed in Politiques, In whom all civil power is immediately and originally ſeated, whether in the people, or no, or in the ſupream Officers? But here in Divinity about Church-power, the Scripture doth eaſily reſolve it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.18, 19, 20. <hi>All power is given me in heaven and in earth</hi>; Therefore he appoints Officers and Ordinances in his Church, and ſo the Miniſters of God have their Church-power from Chriſt. Though the people may chooſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign the man, and Church-officers put him into the Office, yet the Office and Power it ſelf is of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 4. <hi>Take notice of the compleatneſs and perfection of this Miſſion,</hi> Heb. 1.1. <hi>God who at ſundry times ſpake by his Prophets, and by ſeveral w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>yes, doth now ſpeak on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by his Son.</hi> So that ſince Chriſts miſſion, we are not now to expect any other extraordinary miſſions, Chriſt he came as the fulneſs of all; and as he ſaid, <hi>That all thoſe who went before him, were thieves and robbers, viz.</hi> who pretended to be the Chriſt, and did not come in his Name, ſo all thoſe are that ſhall come after, which come not in his Name; What a ſad judgement are the Jews, once the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, delivered up unto, that look ſtill for a <hi>Meſſias</hi> to be ſent, and ſo have a veil upon their eyes and their hearts?</p>

               </note>And firſt Conſider, <hi>That there is a two-fold ſending, a mediate and immediate ſending</hi>; an <hi>immediate</hi> ſending is when God or Chriſt doth in an extraordinary and peculiar manner give ſome a Call to this office; Thus the Prophets of the Old Teſtament they were immediatly ſent of God, and this immediate inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and extraordinary gifting of them was enough to authoriſe them, though they had no Call in an ordinary manner from men, when they ſaid, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord,</hi> then they ſhewed their Commiſſion, and thus the Apoſtles they were likewiſe immediatly called by Chriſt, and they were gifted in an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary manner thereunto, They had no ſuch gifts at firſt, but Chriſt beſtowed them on them; In ordinary ſendings or miſſions, there men muſt firſt try and examine gifts, and ſee them before they confirm any in their office, but Chriſt that can make <hi>Children of Abraham out of ſtones,</hi> can alſo make Apoſtles out of illiterate and rude Fiſhermen; This immediate and extraordinary ſending is now wholly ceaſed, even as the gifts of Miracles; and therefore though our Divines do ſometimes ſay, <hi>Luther, Calvin,</hi> and thoſe firſt Reformers had an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Call, their meaning is not as if they were put into their Church-office by an immediate call of God, only there were extraordinary qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of them, by ſtirring them up to ſuch zeal and corroborating of them to go through ſuch a work as they did. In the next place <hi>there is an ordinary miſſion</hi> or authorizing, and that is to be perpetual in the Church, according to ſuch Rules, as <hi>Paul</hi> laieth down in his Epiſtles to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> which are a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectory concerning the Churches Government to the ends of the world; This ordinary ſending we are now to have, though the Apoſtles had an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary.</p>

            <p n="2">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. Though private improvement of Gifts be lawfull to Parents, Maſters, and one Chriſtian to another, yet <hi>take heed that thereby you do not justle out the Office of the Miniſters,</hi> or becauſe of your gifts to neglect the publike Office Chriſt hath appointed, for the devil is buſie both waies either by prophane ſottiſhneſs and ignorance, to make men deſpiſe the Miniſtry, or by ſelf-conceit and pride of their own abilities; This the Apoſtle alſo provides againſt, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.14. when he had commanded them <hi>to edifie one another,</hi> leſt it might be thought, what need we any Miniſters then? See how affectionately he addeth, <hi>and we beſeech you to know them that labour among you, and are over you in the Lord</hi>; They muſt not for all their Gifts and improvements neglect that, So in the ſame Chapter, 19, 20, 21. <hi>verſes</hi>; where private Chriſtians are commanded to <hi>prove all things,</hi> and not to <hi>Quench the Spirit</hi>; They muſt ſtir up the gifts and graces of Gods Spirit in them, yet ſo as not to deſpiſe Propheſyings, that is the miniſteriall In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of Scripture, as the word to <hi>propheſie</hi> is commonly uſed.</p>

There is alſo great difference to be made between <hi>a Church under Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions or not constituted, and a Church conſtituted</hi>; That may be done in times of Perſecution which may not in ſetled times of the Church; We ſee in caſe of extreme danger every man is a Magiſtrate, and may kill when aſſaulted ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then be killed; but it doth not therefore follow that every man may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully take upon him ordinarily the office of a Magiſtrate; The Sabbath might be broken in regard of neceſſity, and our Saviour from this excuſeth <hi>David</hi> for eating the Shew bread, which was lawfull only for the Prieſts to eat: Thus we reade of two private perſons that were a means to convert the <hi>Perſian</hi> King, and others, once to the Chriſtian Faith; Though theſe when they had opportunity ſought to have their office confirmed, and ſo if that Inſtance ſo much preſſed <hi>Act.</hi> 16.8. of the Diſciples preaching the Goſpel upon the Perſecution, could be manifeſted to be underſtood of private Diſciples and men out of office (the contrary whereof there are ſtrong preſumptions for) yet it would prove no more, but that in caſe of Perſecution, when beleevers are ſcattered up and down, it's lawfull for them to declare and make known Chriſt and his Truth; But what is this to a Church conſtituted, and walking in an orderly way?</p>
            <p n="5">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/> 5. This doctrine of the neceſſity of a lawful Call and authority in thoſe that preach is very <hi>neceſſary and profitable,</hi> and that partly in reſpect of the Miniſters themſelves, and partly in reſpect of the people; On the Miniſters part,</p>
            <p n="1">1. He can with the more quietneſſe and comfort ſatisfie himſelf in his work; You ſee the Phariſees they queſtioned Chriſt upon this very Point, <hi>By what authority he did theſe things</hi>? Mat. 21.23. Now our Saviour he ſuppoſeth that to
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:65216:267"/>

I have Gifts, but he goeth to prove that he had authority from God; Certainly to live in ſuch a way wherein the Conſcience of a Miniſter is not ſatisfied, that it's a lawful office, muſt needs be diſquieting of him, eſpecially when there are ſo many that ſay they have no Call, or that their Call is Antichriſtian, Is it not neceſſary to a Miniſter to be informed that by the Scripture he can juſtifie his Call and office?</p>
            <p n="2">2. It's neceſſary becauſe then he may expect Gods bleſſing and protection; When Chriſt ſaith, <hi>I will be with you to the end of the world,</hi> and <hi>he that deſpiſeth you despiſeth me,</hi> this is to be underſtood of ſuch as are in Chriſts office, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.

            <p n="2">2. On the Auditors part, for when they are convinced that ſuch are the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of Chriſt, They will 1. Hear with the more reverence and reſpect, even as Chriſt himſelf ſaith, <hi>A ſtranger Chriſts Sheep will not hear.</hi>

Now to this it is anſwered, That if Preaching be taken largely for any declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or publiſhing of the Word of God, no doubt but it is preaching, but yet it is not that miniſterial preaching which is enjoyned the Officers of the Church, <hi>To preach in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon, to divide the word of God,</hi> and that with ſuch faithfulneſs and ability, that the Apoſtle crieth out, <hi>Who is ſufficient for theſe things?</hi> This was more then to reade the Scripture.

Many men may go unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully into the Office, fail in many particulars, yet partake of the ſubſtance of the office, but others may uſurp it ſo, that they have not the very Office it ſelf; and this is very neceſſary to obſerve, <hi>For where the Office is null, and no Miniſtry, there the adminiſtration of the Sacraments is according to the received opinion void:</hi> As the Papiſts argue, Becauſe we have no Miniſtry, we have no Church, no Sacrament.

But certainly, it may juſtly be a great ſhaking to private perſons, that if the Miniſtry they live under be not a true Miniſtry, thus their Baptiſme is not a true Baptiſme, the Church they live in a true Church; for though a Miniſtry be not neceſſary to an Eſſential Church, as in times of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, when beleevers are ſcattered up and down, yet it is to an Organical Church, according to that definition of <hi>Cyprian, Eccleſia eſſet plebs adorna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta clero.</hi>

               <hi>ſcopi, Overſeers, Elders, Paſtours</hi> and <hi>Teachers:</hi> They are called <hi>lights</hi> and <hi>guides:</hi> They are ſaid to be <hi>over them in the Lord</hi>; So that it's plain, that the Scripture makes this clear diſtinction, ſome are <hi>Rulers,</hi> and <hi>Guides,</hi> and <hi>Shepherds,</hi> ſome again are to be <hi>ruled,</hi> and are under, <hi>To the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and Saints at Philippi,</hi> Phil. 1.1. Thus the whole Church is divided into it's Officers, and thoſe that are governed. It's a wonder that any can contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict theſe clear places; neither may we think that the Scripture giveth them theſe names without reality, as they did by ſcorn to Chriſt, calling him, <hi>King of the Jews.</hi> Certainly, if there were not ſuch diſtinct relations, then the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle might as well call the people Guides and Elders, and exhort ſuch who were over them to ſubmit to thoſe that were under them.</p>
            <p>

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> Thirdly, <hi>They are under a peculiar charge and account.</hi> Their eſtate is more dreadfull then others, if they be found negligent. <hi>Woe be unto me</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul) if I preach not the Word:</hi> So <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. they are ſaid <hi>to give an account,</hi> and it's deſired <hi>they may do it with joy, and not with grief</hi>; If there be no Miniſterial of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, then we are not reſponſible for the ſouls of men.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/> Fourthly, <hi>The people are required to do diſtinct duties to them, to hear them, to obey them, to ſubmit themſelves to them, to eſteem of them as the Meſſengers of God,</hi> yea, <hi>to have them in high eſtimation for their works ſake.</hi> Certainly, none can impartially reade the Epiſtles of <hi>Paul,</hi> (therefore I need not name the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular places) but he muſt be convinced of the diſtinct Office of a Miniſtry, and the peoples duty thereunto.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="499" facs="tcp:65216:269"/>In the third place, we are to prove,<note place="margin">That none may enter into this Office without an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritative miſſion.</note> 
               <hi>That none may enter into this Office with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an Authoritative Miſſion.</hi> And</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, <hi>Here is conſtant example and patern of the Church in the Apoſtles times.</hi> We cannot reade of any that undertook this Office, but they were ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly ſet apart to it, <hi>Acts</hi> 14.23. and in other places. Now if in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive times, when yet Chriſtians were ſo eminently gifted, there was a ſolemn ſetting of them apart, How much more in after ages? Neither can any one example be brought to the contrary, I mean of taking an Office in the Church without a Call: Now is it not farre better to follow the preſidents of Scripture, then to go after our own thoughts? eſpecially when Chriſt himſelf, though ſo admirably gifted, yet would not undertake this Office without a Call, as the Apoſtle doth diligently conſider it, <hi>Heb</hi> 5.7.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, The Apoſtle in his Epiſtles to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus, doth lay down ſeverall Qualifications, which ought to be in every Miniſter: Now what ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity is there of this, if ſo be thoſe who are to ordain them, were not to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend thereunto?</hi> The very mentioning of ſuch properties, is for this end, to ſhew, by what rule they ſhould go by in their Ordination, who would not think himſelf qualified, who would not ſay he had gifts, if they were not to be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined and judged in that matter?</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, <hi>If it were not neceſſary there ſhould be an authoritative Ordination of men to that Office, why ſhould the Apoſtle with ſuch diligence leave Titus at Crete to ordain ſuch, if ſo be their gifts and abilities had been enough?</hi> It was an abſurd thing to leave him there to appoint them for that Office, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.5. The place is conſiderable, becauſe by that you ſee plainly, Elders were not to intrude them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but were to be ſet apart by <hi>Titus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, <hi>Yea if there were not ſuch a duty upon Church-officers in confirming of others, why ſhould the Apostle likewiſe to Timothy uſe that ſevere and dreadfull adjuration?</hi> 1 Tim, 5.21. where <hi>Timothy</hi> is <hi>charged before God,</hi> in reference to this matter of laying on of hands, as well as other things, and <hi>Chriſt and the holy Angels, that he do nothing with partiality, nor be too haſty herein, leſt we partake of other mens ſinnes:</hi> How could this be, but that men are not of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to intrude thereunto, otherwiſe their ſins would be upon their own heads, who go without a Call?</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly, When the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Lay hands ſuddenly on no man</hi>; In that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative command is contained an affirmative, as <hi>Walleus</hi> well obſerveth, <hi>viz.</hi> with deliberation and good advice to lay hands on thoſe that are ſufficiently qualified: ſo that there is not only an example but a command, and that lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on of hands is not a meer accidental Ceremony, appeareth, in that by this action he deſcribeth the whole confirmation in that Office, which <hi>Synecdoche</hi> could not be, unleſſe it were either an eſſential part, or a proper and inſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble adjunct. Certainly theſe Arguments may ſatisfie any that are not conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious. This hath been ever both in the Apoſtles dayes, and ſince their time, a conſtant cuſtom, judged to be grounded upon the Scripture. Neither may we look for ſuch cogent and clear demonſtrations in matter of Church order, as in Fundamentall Doctrines. If any deſire further inſight, he may peruſe thoſe ſeveral learned Tractates that have lately come out to confirme this Truth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But you will ſay, If a man have Gifts and Abilities, why is not that enough?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer firſt, Chriſt had Gifts, and yet he would have a Calling. In the primitive times private Chriſtians did abound with Gifts, yet they were to be ſet apart for that Office.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Gifts in civil offices and relations, do not give Power and Authority to do a thing: A private Lawyer may have as good, or better gifts, then the
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:65216:270"/>
Judge: Shall he therefore take upon him to condemne men? A man would not willingly have ſuch Divinity in his own Family: It may be thy ſervant hath as good or better Gifts to manage thy houſhold affairs, might be a better husband, doth not ſpend as thou wilt, Shall he take upon him to be thy Maſter? There is many a poor man hath a better gift to husband thy eſtate then thou doeſt, Shall he therefore ſeize upon thy revenues? There muſt be a Call, beſides theſe Gifts.</p>
            <p n="3">3. By this means every private man, yea woman and childe may admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter the Sacraments; Cannot a woman ſprinkle water on the childe, and baptize it? There are none ſo ſimple ſcarce, but have Gifts for this. In the Old Teſtament others could have killed a beaſt for the Sacrifice, as well as the Prieſt, Might they therefore lawfully do it? So that Gifts muſt have a Call?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> How bleſſed and happy a thing it is, when the publick Miniſtry, and private Chriſtians abilities, are orderly improved for the Glory of God; when one doth not contradict, or encroach upon another, but the upper orbes and lower orbes doe all turne about for the publique good, when Chriſtians edifie one another, and yet have thoſe in high eſteeme, that labour over them in the Lord. Certainly, while this Harmony and Union is kept up, the Devil cannot diſturb the Church. We have a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Prophecy by <hi>Zechary,</hi> what ſhall be done in the times of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, <hi>Zech.</hi> 13.5. where men that had no call to preach, being convinced of their errour, and that by their deareſt friends, he ſhall diſclaime that way, ſaying, <hi>I am no Prophet, I am an Huſbandman, for man taught me to keep cattel from my youth.</hi>

            </epigraph>
            <p>OUR Saviour had praied for the Sanctification of his Diſciples, and one Reaſon is from the office they were placed in, which hath been diſpatched. The other is in this Verſe, <hi>From Chriſts Mediation</hi> mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted in his Death for them He had <hi>merited</hi> and <hi>purchaſed</hi> this at Gods hand by making himſelf an atonement for them; Chriſt you heard was the High-Prieſt of his Church, and two things did belong to them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To pray for the people,</p>
            <p n="2">2. To make a Sacrifice for them: Now our Saviour in this Chapter doth both, he praieth, and offereth up himſelf a Sacrifice for his people.</p>
            <p>So that in the words we are to conſider, The <hi>Perſon,</hi> The <hi>Action,</hi> The <hi>object matter,</hi> The <hi>Finis cui,</hi> and the <hi>Finis cujus</hi>:</p>
            <p>The <hi>Perſon, I ſanctifie my ſelf, I,</hi> By this we ſee partly the Deity of Chriſt, for none but God can ſay, he ſanctifieth himſelf that others may be ſanctified; and then this denoteth his willingneſſe and readineſſe, Chriſt did readily offer up himſelf to all that miſery and ſhame for our ſakes.</p>
            <p>Secondly, There is the <hi>Action,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Sanctifie,</hi> This among many other ſignifications hath theſe three eſpecially.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>To ſet apart,</hi> and ſolemnly to fit for any duty.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To <hi>dedicate</hi> and conſecrate in a peculiar manner to the Lord, Thus the Prieſts were ſanctified and the Sacrifices were ſanctified.</p>
            <p n="3">3. To <hi>make holy by inherent purity,</hi> and in all theſe reſpects Chriſt did ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie himſelf;</p>
            <p>For 1. He as God did fill the humane Nature with all habituall and actuall Righteouſneſſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He did ſet and ſanctifie himſelf to be an oblation, and therefore it is that the Apoſtle doth ſo often call him the High-Prieſt in his Epiſtle to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, There is the object matter, and that is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>my ſelf</hi>; The Prieſts of the Old Teſtament did conſecrate the Beaſts that were ſlain, but here Chriſt ſanctifieth himſelf, So that he is both the Prieſt and the Sacrifice alſo, It is himſelf, and that is the greater love.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="502" facs="tcp:65216:271"/>Further, There is the <hi>End</hi> for whom, <hi>for them,</hi> and <hi>this doth evidently prove Chriſt to be a Sacrifice of Atonement,</hi> For whereas the Apoſtle <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.2. there ſaith Chriſt gave himſelf an offering and a Sacrifice to God <hi>for a ſweet ſmelling ſavour.</hi> The Socinian would thereby underſtand no more then the accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe of it, not that is was propitiatory for us, and they compare it with the liberality of the <hi>Philippians</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Phil. 4.18. where the Apoſtle cals their Gift <hi>an Odour of a ſweet ſmell acceptable to Ged,</hi> yet this is only part of the meaning, and the phraſe is not wholly alike, for in that place of <hi>Phil.</hi> it is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>for us,</hi> as in <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.2. So that Chriſt gave himſelf for a Sacrifice not metaphorically, as Praier, and Alms are ſometimes called Sacrifices, but by way of Atonement to ſatisfie God, So that by this means we alſo are an Odour of ſweet ſmell un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Finis cujus</hi> is that they might be ſanctified, of which more hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; From Chriſt thus Sanctifying himſelf to be a Sacrifice for us Obſerve,</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Doct.</hi> That Chriſt ſet himſelf apart to be a Sacrifice for us.</note>
               <hi>That Chriſt ſet himſelf apart to be a Sacrifice for us, or he ſanctified himſelf to become a Sacrifice for us</hi>; This is the Summe of all Divinity, All the Types in the Old Teſtament did look to this; The Apoſtle deſired to know nothing but this; This is the Foundation of the Efficacy both of Chriſts Prayers and of ours, Had Chriſt onely praied for us, and not thus ſanctified himſelf to be a Sacrifice for us, it would not have been effectuall for our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>

                  <p>In my Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
                  <p>What Chriſts ſanctifying himſelf impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
               </note>Let us Open this Point, though I ſhall not inſiſt long on it, becauſe I have otherwhere ſhewed, <hi>That Chriſt ſuffered by way of an atoning Sacrifice</hi>; I ſhall now ſpeak the more briefly of it:</p>
            <p>And firſt, This Sanctification of himſelf to be a Sacrifice for us doth imply <hi>the exceeding Purity and Holineſſe that was in him,</hi> and therefore <hi>Peter</hi> cals him the <hi>undefiled and ſpotleſſe Lamb,</hi> 1 Peter 1.9. In the Old Teſtament The Lamb that was to be offered was to be without blemiſh,<note place="margin">I. His purity and holineſſe.</note> not to be defective in any parts, and to be without ſpot; There was to be no various colour upon it; This was to ſignifie the abſolute Purity of Chriſt in reſpect of outward and inward ſinne; And therefore the Apoſtle preſſeth the prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minency of Chriſt our High-Prieſt above thoſe of the Law, becauſe they had ſinnes of their own, and they were compaſſed about with their own Infirmities, and ſo offered for themſelves firſt, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 7.26. He is there called <hi>holy, harmleſſe, undefiled, and ſeparate from Sinners</hi>; And this Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Holineſſe was not only to qualifie his Perſon to be our Mediatour, but it was part of that Righteouſneſſe which is communicated to us, There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſaith, <hi>I ſanctifie my ſelf for them</hi>; And as he was made man for Beleevers, So alſo holy and undefiled for them; It's true ſome Divines di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh in Chriſt his <hi>Juſtitia perſonae,</hi> and his <hi>Juſtitia meriti,</hi> but the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of Chriſt was part of his merit, and ſo they cannot be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to one another; This is the Wedding Garment; This is our Elder Brothers Clothes; This is the fine Linnen of the Saints; Therefore thou that complaineſt of thy want of Holineſſe, Thou art not ſanctified in ſuch a degree and meaſure as thou deſireſt, remember Chriſt hath ſanctified himſelf for thee.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">II: His ready of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering himſelf for us.</note>Secondly, This doth imply <hi>the ready and willing offering up of himſelf to this work</hi>; And certainly this is the great Myſtery at which Heaven and Earth may be aſtoniſhed: This the Angels wonder at, and ſtill deſire to ſearch into it more and more; That Chriſt ſhould come from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome of the Father, and lay aſide the manifeſtation of all Heavenly Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty and Glory, to be debaſed in ſo low a way, making himſelf of no repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; This can never be conſidered of enough, no, not by all the Angels and Saints to all Eternity, <hi>Philip.</hi> 2.6. The Apoſtle doth there enlarge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:65216:271"/>
in this Meditation, and in another place, <hi>how he became poor that we might make us rich.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Two things are admirable in this willing Oblation of himſelf.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That he ſhould put himſelf in ſuch a ſuffering condition, as to be for a while without the ſenſe and enjoyment of his Fathers love to him; <hi>He that was in the Boſome of the Father,</hi> an Expreſſion to ſhew the intimate, cloſe, and ſecret delight and love he had from the Father; How unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able is it that he ſhould deprive himſelf of the ſenſe of it? To put himſelf as it were out of Heaven into an Hell, this is deeper love then ever we can imagine or conceive: No wonder the Apoſtle cals it <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>the unſearc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ble Riches of Grace,</hi> We are never able to go to the bottome of it, but ſtill there is more love and grace behinde: Did the Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> faint to ſee the temporall Statelineſſe and magnificence of <hi>Solomon?</hi> How ſhould the Believer at the ſight of this Heavenly Glory be even ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhed with Admiration: No wonder if the Church cry out, <hi>She is ſick of Love,</hi> for this may do it: It was more for Chriſt to be one moment with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the feeling of his Fathers Love, then to endure all thoſe bodily Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments he did endure, <hi>My God, My God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> In the Originall it is, <hi>My ſtrong One,</hi> He giveth unto God that peculiar and proper Title, becauſe he was then ſo weak and infirm, and dejected in himſelf.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That he ſhould not thus only put himſelf out of comfort, but alſo from the enjoyment of that manifeſted glory and honour he might have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to himſelf, This alſo was very wonderfull. In this Chapter he pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for that Glory which yet he had with the Father from the beginning of the world, he had it in right but not in poſſeſſion; He voluntarily diveſted himſelf of that, that ſo he might accompliſh our Redemption; <hi>Job</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailed once the bitter change that was upon him, He that ſate among Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to ſit upon the Dunghill ſcraping his ſoars, this was a great Change, but this Change that Chriſt took upon himſelf was infinitely farre tranſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it.</p>

Now Chriſt is fitted with Kingly power to conquer and deſtroy the power of ſinne and Satan; There is no luſt, no Corruption that is too bigge for the King of Glory to overcome: Thus as the Jewiſh Prieſt repreſented Chriſt in his Prieſtly Office, So <hi>Joſhua,</hi> the Sonne of <hi>Nun</hi> did Chriſt in his Kingly Office, as the Apoſtle inſinuateth, for <hi>Heb</hi> 4.8. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7 2. as no <hi>Ogs</hi> or Sonnes or <hi>Anak</hi> the greateſt Giants and warlike men in the world were able to ſtand before him, but he did bring the People of God unto their Reſt; Thus alſo will Chriſt who is both the King of Righteouſneſſe and King of Peace ſubdue all our Spirituall Enemies, and eſtabliſh us in Everlaſting Reſt, He will firſt be a King of Righteouſneſſe, and then a King of Peace, he will firſt conquer thy

            <p>WE are demonſtrating, what is implied in this phraſe, <hi>I ſanctifie my ſelf for them</hi>; There remain more particulars, which are as follow.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">V. That he was wholly ſet apart for us.</note>Firſt, This ſignifieth, <hi>That Chriſt was wholly ſet apart for us, that he had no other work or imployment, but to minde our good, and procure it for us.</hi> In the Scripture phraſe to be <hi>ſanctified,</hi> is often uſed for to <hi>ſet apart</hi> and <hi>dedicate</hi> to ſuch a work, that if it be otherwiſe imployed, there is a kinde of prophanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and pollution; ſo if the veſſels dedicated to Gods ſervice, and ſanctified, were imployed, as <hi>Belſhazzar</hi> did in any common uſe, this was the polluting and defiling of thoſe veſſels. In ſome ſenſe it holds here, <hi>Chriſt was made man, and made under the Law,</hi> not for himſelf, but <hi>for us</hi>; Inſomuch that if he had done other work then this, he had, as it were, polluted himſelf, he would not then have been doing the work of a Mediatour. Though ſome learned men think, That Chriſt obeyed the Law for himſelf, yet that cannot be, becauſe all glory and happineſſe was due unto him from the firſt beginning of his Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: He prayed indeed for the manifeſtation and external poſſeſſion of that glory, which yet (he ſaith) he had before the world was made with the Father: Seeing therefore that Chriſt had by vertue of the perſonal Union all bleſſedneſs and happineſs due unto him, <hi>He could not obſerve the Law, that by the obedience thereof he might inherit eternal life,</hi> but the whole courſe of his life, whether in doing or ſufferings, was wholly for our good: That as the Sunne was made not for it ſelf, but for the world, ſo this <hi>Sunne of Righteouſneſſe did ariſe with healing in his wings for us alone.</hi> He came as a Phyſician, of whom we could not ſay, <hi>Phyſician heal thy ſelf.</hi> This then is a treaſure of infinite conſolation, That whatſoever Chriſt was, or did, it was wholly for us, had it not been for man fallen, the Scripture doth not intimate he would have become man. It is true, ſome Schoolmen ſay, That the Incarnation of Chriſt was in it ſelf ſo glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious a demonſtration of Gods wiſdome and power, and ſo deſirable in it ſelf, that though man had not ſinned, yet Chriſt would have been made man, this being a more glorious thing then the creation of the world, or any thing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; yet the Scripture ſuppoſeth no other end why Chriſt came into the world, but to be a Saviour, which implieth man a loſt ſinner. Hence <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9. <hi>To us a
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:65216:273"/>
Sonne is born, To us a childe is given</hi>; and <hi>Paul, who gave himſelf for me,</hi> Gal. 2.20. Therefore his death is compared to a <hi>price</hi> and a <hi>ranſome,</hi> and he himſelf to a <hi>Mediatour</hi> and <hi>Surety:</hi> All which denominate he was not for himſelf, but for us; yea his Names ſpeak thus much, he was a <hi>Jeſus, becauſe he ſaveth his people from their ſinnes</hi>; a <hi>Chriſt,</hi> becauſe anointed to do this work; An <hi>Head,</hi> becauſe of his influx into his Members: Hence the Schoolmen do well deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, That the habitual Grace of Chriſt, and the Grace that he had as head, is all one really, and differs only notionally, <hi>Of his fulneſſe we have all received, Joh.</hi> 1.16. Grace in Chriſt is not to be conſidered, as his perſonal perfection, but as our fulneſſe. As the Fountain hath water, not for it ſelf, but the ſtreams; and as the Head doth not <hi>ſentire,</hi> or put forth acts of ſenſe for it ſelf properly, but the whole compound: Inſomuch that there is nothing which Chriſt did as Mediatour, but it was all for us; and therefore the Scripture ſaith, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.11. <hi>It pleaſed the Father, that in him ſhould all fulneſſe dwell.</hi> Chriſt then is for us, and the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>He ſought not to pleaſe himſelf,</hi> Rom. 15.3. and <hi>he became poor that we might be made rich,</hi> 2 Cor. 8 9.</p>
            <p>Hence ſecondly it followeth, <hi>That if Chriſt ſanctified himſelf thus wholly for us,</hi>
               <note place="margin">VI. That if by faith we im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove him not for thoſe ends God appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, we make him a Chriſt in vain.</note> 
               <hi>if we do not by faith improve him for thoſe ends God appointed him, we make him a Chriſt in vain, to have ſanctified himſelf, and died in vain:</hi> Even as the Sunne would ſhine in vain, if all were blinde and did not enjoy the light of it; as the <hi>brazen Serpent</hi> would have been exalted in vain, if none that were ſtung would have looked upon it: Oh then let the godly fear, leſt by their unbelief and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt, they make Chriſt a Chriſt in vain, his Sanctification of himſelf wholly in vain! Unbelief doth practically what thoſe falſe teachers of righteouſneſſe by the Law did doctrinally, <hi>If righteouſneſſe come by the Law</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>then Christ died in vain.</hi> And thus it is here, If Chriſt ſanctified and fitted himſelf to enrich thee, to juſtifie thee, to ſanctifie thee, and thou by thy unbelief wilt not receive thoſe things, then is he a Chriſt in vain, as to thee: Oh remember, <hi>If God will not hold him guiltleſſe that takes his Name in vain,</hi> how much more that ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth Chriſt in vain, which is the moſt glorious name (as we may ſay) whereby God is made known!</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>This Sanctification of Chriſt did denote ſome kinde of ſinne and pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon him by way of imputation:</hi> For ſuch things as were unclean,<note place="margin">VII. It denotes him a ſinner by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation.</note> they were <hi>ſanctified</hi> by legal Rites: Now it's true, Chriſt of himſelf had no uncleanneſs, being then <hi>holy, undefiled, and ſeparate from ſinners,</hi> yet becauſe he was our Surety, and undertook our debt, bearing our ſinnes upon him; therefore it is that he had imputed ſinnes, though not inherent: Even as the <hi>ſcape-goat</hi> had the ſinnes of the people laid upon it: Hence it is that <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. <hi>ult.</hi> his ſecond coming is ſaid to be <hi>without ſin,</hi> implying that his firſt was nor, becauſe our ſins were laid on him, and therefore did he ſo much ſtrive in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, with thoſe exceſſive agonies in his ſoul, becauſe of the ſenſe of Gods anger for our ſins. Though then the Scripture ſaith, <hi>He took all our infirmities upon him, but without ſin,</hi> that is to be underſtood of ſin inherent in him, no ſuch vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per could faſten on him; yet in reſpect of imputation our ſins were charged on him, and ſo <hi>he ſanctified himſelf in his oblation, by taking away the guilt of them:</hi> Oh then conſider the infinite love of Chriſt, and be amazed at it, that he ſhould become ſin, and a curſe for us, that he ſhould be under the diſpleaſure of God for us, who was in our perſons to have conflicted with it!</p>
            <p>Fourthly, In that Chriſt is here ſaid <hi>to ſanctifie himſelf for us,</hi>
               <note place="margin">VIII. That he was a Prieſt to make atonement for us.</note> there is hereby im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, <hi>That Chriſt was a Prieſt to make an atonement for us:</hi> and hereupon we might enlarge our ſelves, concerning Chriſts Prieſtly-office, which is of great concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as appeareth by the Apoſtle at large in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> who doth ſo induſtriouſly aſſert and explicate this Office, as being that which is the foundation of all our grace and conſolation. I ſhall only mention theſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars:</p>

               <note place="margin">Concerning Chriſts prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-office, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider theſe things.</note>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, <hi>This Prieſtly-office did conſiſt in offering up himſelf a Sacrifice:</hi> Every Prieſt was to expiate ſin by Sacrifices: Now becauſe God would not have burnt-offerings any longer, neither could the blood of Rams and Goats purge away ſin, therefore Chriſt came to make an atonement: So that now we have recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation with God upon a two-fold ground, his <hi>Mercy</hi> and his <hi>Juſtice.</hi> It's his mercy to ſend Chriſt into the world, yet in that Chriſt muſt ſatisfie by his death it's juſtice: And this muſt needs adminiſter much boldneſs at the throne of grace, for juſtice can not now implead us: The only attribute that a ſinner would fear, is Gods juſtice; though he be gracious, yet he is juſt alſo; he demonſtrated his juſtice in deſtroying all the apoſtate Angels, and not ſaving one of them. The Scripture repreſents him every where <hi>to be a juſt God, that will not acquit the guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that will render to every one according to his works.</hi> Oh (ſaith the poor ſinner) at this I tremble, under this I bow down, but now by Chriſts Prieſtly-office, juſtice is made on our ſide, not only grace is for us, but juſtice alſo; now our very ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my once doth ſpeak for us, Juſtice, I am ſatisfied, I can require no more: then juſtice would be unjuſt, if it ſhould require the paiment of the ſame debt twice: This is ingraffed in mans heart to make a ſatisfaction and compenſation to God, but that was altogether vain, which man did attempt to do, therefore Chriſt came to ſatisfie for all.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. <hi>Herein Chriſts Prieſtly-office did exceed thoſe Prieſts in the Law,</hi> That they were only typical and did outwardly cleanſe, but they did not reach to the ſoul, neither would they effect any immediate advantages upon it. The Apoſtle dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently preſſeth this in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> is ſevere againſt thoſe, who reſted upon thoſe external Sacrifices, or any works of the Law neglecting Chriſt, and this truth belongs to Chriſtians alſo, for the blood of Chriſt is not eſteem'd; we think Baptiſme will clear us, our tears for ſinne, or duties will compenſate. Thus Chriſt is not in our thoughts and in our hearts: Therefore whoſoever doth not in every prayer, in every du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, look to the blood of Chriſt to cleanſe him, he forgets this truth, that Chriſt ſanctified himſelf for us, we walk as if our duties, or Sacraments, or Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were ſanctified to be our Mediatours. It's the blood of Chriſt only that clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth away our ſins, and that purifieth our perſons and conſciences.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. <hi>This Prieſtly-office of Chriſt is not only in the oblation of his body, but alſo in his prayers for us.</hi> Thus the Prieſt did in the Law, ſo that his prayers had more in them, then any private man, it being a prayer by one authorized and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thereunto. Chriſt in this alſo is our High prieſt; his prayers were of two ſorts, 1. Thoſe that he prayed for, while here on the earth, whereof this deſcribed in the Chapter is a chief one; and the other is that Interceſſion, which he ſtill makes in heaven for us;<note place="margin">Wherein this prayer, and his interceſſion in heaven differ.</note> they differ in the manner of petitioning, for thoſe on earth were with great cries and groans debaſing himſelf; but this in heaven is nothing but the preſentation of his will, that what he had pray'd for, and obtained for his people, ſhould be applied to them. Now Chriſts prayer is infinitely above the High prieſts prayers, for this is the prayer of him who is God as well as man, it's of him who is the beloved Son of the Father: ſo that nothing can be in juſtice denied to Chriſts prayer, becauſe it's a meriting and an obliging prayer.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It tranſcends in love, becauſe Chriſt is ſo dear unto the Father: What ſhall we ſay to theſe things that are ſo unſpeakably happy for the members of Chriſt?</p>

            <p n="2">2. <hi>This implieth the ſpirituality of his Prieſthood,</hi> for <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> though a Prieſt, yet brought only bread and wine by way of refreſhment to <hi>Abraham.</hi> It's a wonder to ſee how men of great learning and parts would finde out a real Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice in that fact of <hi>Melchiſedechs,</hi> but it is eaſily proved, that Chriſt after that bodily oblation of himſelf, hath now appointed no other Sacrifices but ſpiritual. There is now nothing bodily or carnal in the Sacraments: It's <hi>ſurſum corda,</hi> and we are to prepare faith, not our teeth for the Sacrament. The Prieſtly-office of old was in a carnal bodily way ſuitable to all the other religious exerciſes; But now the external way of Chriſt is ſpiritual; we are to offer ſpiritual Sacrifices, and our prayers are ſpiritual Sacrifices.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>There is implied the perpetuity of it, Melchiſedech was a Prieſt for ever.</hi> There is no abolition or tranſlation of this Office, no Succeſſour to it, therefore Chriſt doth abide for ever, <hi>That once oblation of himſelf perfected for ever thoſe that were his:</hi> So that if he had offered up himſelf an hundred times more, it could not have been more effectual, then this once oblation.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>This Prieſtly-office was confirmed by an Oath, God ſwore to the perpetuity of it.</hi> The Apoſtle doth greatly aggravate this, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.21. <hi>That God did not onely promiſe, but confirm it with an Oath:</hi> Every word of God is as ſure as an oath can be, but this was done to eſtabliſh our faith; for it's the hardeſt thing in the world to a troubled ſoul for ſinne, to believe that Chriſt hath made ſuch an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement, or to believe ſuch a reconciliation; therefore God did not only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe it, but ſwore to it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> To fill the heart of thoſe that do truly believe with unſpeakable joy; Chriſt ſanctified himſelf to bring about thy peace: Here is oyl enough, if thou bring cruiſes to receive it: Is it not ſinne in the power of it, and the guilt of it, that troubleth thee? Doth not that raiſe a great gulph between God and thee? Behold Chriſt hath ſanctified himſelf, that ſinne ſhould be as if it never had been. This is the Paſchal Lamb that you are not to eat boiled or raw, but roſted with fire, not with wateriſh empty ſpeculations, but fervent affections of faith. Are you to meditate on this Sacrifice? This blood ſpeaks all good things for thee.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>That Chriſt was not only the Prieſt but the Sacrifice it ſelf</hi>; He offered up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in that bloudy and ignominious death <hi>for our ſakes</hi>; This is the great my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of our Chriſtian Religion, whether you do regard the Doctrinal part of it as a Truth to be beleeved, or as it's Declarative of the love of God and Chriſt to his Church; The Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> cap. 53. is of old, long before it was accompliſhed, greatly affected with it, and <hi>Paul</hi> upon every occaſion is large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly amplifying this ſubſtantial Point.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Propoſitions concerning Chriſts Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</note>To clear it Conſider theſe Introductions,</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>That Chriſt was both Prieſt, Sacrifice, and Altar,</hi> Every thing in Chriſt is wonderful; There is nothing in him after the ordinary manner of nature, and therefore he may juſtly by the Prophet be called <hi>Wonderfull,</hi> and as in other particulars,<note place="margin">I. That Chriſt was both Prieſt, Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and Altar.</note> ſo in this it is true, That he ſhould be <hi>Prieſt, Sacrifice,</hi> and <hi>Altar; Priest,</hi> he was in both his Natures as God and man: <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> he was in his humane nature, becauſe that only could ſuffer; And <hi>Altar,</hi> he was in reſpect of his Divine Nature, becauſe by that he was ſanctified; Oh then the admirable wiſedom of God that hath thus appointed all fulneſſe to be in him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> When <hi>Abraham</hi> was to offer <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and the Childe was bound ready to be ſacrificed, he asketh his Father, <hi>but where is the Sacrifice? God</hi> (ſaith <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham) will provide one</hi>;<note place="margin">II. What things are neceſſary to a Sacrifice.</note> Thus when all mankinde like <hi>Iſaac</hi> was ready to be Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed to the Eternal diſpleaſure of God, even then God found a Sacrifice for us.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Conſider what is neceſſary to a Sacrifice, and that is, <hi>That there
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:65216:275"/>
be ſome kinde of deſtruction or annihilation of the thing to the honour and glory of God</hi>; And thus a Sacrifice and a Sacrament differ, a Sacrifice is by offering up of <hi>ſomething to God,</hi> a Sacrament is when God <hi>offers and giveth ſomething to us,</hi> Therefore when the Papiſts make the Lords Supper to be a Sacrament and a Sacrifice alſo, they ſpeak repugnancies; In a Sacrament God giveth to us, In a Sacrifice we give to God: Now among the Jews there were many kindes of Sacrifices, and moſt of them did typically repreſent Chriſt; The <hi>Paſchal Lamb</hi> and the Sacrificing of the Red Heifer, theſe are plainly applied unto Chriſt, but above all kindes of Sacrifices thoſe that we called <hi>Holocatomata whole burnt-Offerings</hi>; Theſe did in a moſt lively manner typifie him, for there the whole was to be burnt in fire, and offered to God, which denoted the great humiliation of Chriſt both in Soul and body, and alſo the exquiſite Torments and Sufferings which were upon him, ſo that he was wounded all over for our Tranſgreſſions.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Take notice that he offered up his <hi>body as a Sacrifice to God</hi>;<note place="margin">III. He offered himſelf to God.</note> It was in reference to him, not meerly in reſpect of men, to witneſſe the Truth of God, but as every Sacrifice ought to be, it was wholly in reference to God, though tending thereby to our good: It's unlawful to offer Sacrifices to any but God, becauſe hereby is repreſented Gods ſupreme dominion and Majeſty, which is ſignified by the annihilation or deſtruction of the thing offered; Now though Chriſt did not ceaſe to be God, yet by his Death there was a ſeparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſoul and body, though not of the divine nature from either; It was then unto God that he offered up himſelf.</p>
            <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">IV. It was by way of Expiotion.</note> 
               <hi>This Sacrifice it was by way of expiation and propitiation to atone and pacifie the Juſtice of God,</hi> which otherwiſe would have been a conſuming fire to all mankinde, as it was to the Apoſtate Angels: Sacrifices do imply ſome kinde of Expiation, and by Heathens were uſed to pacifie the wrath of their gods, and thus if Chriſts body offered was truly and properly a Sacrifice, then it could be no other but by way of expiation and ſatisfaction; Now that it was ſuch an expiatory Sacrifice is plain by the Apoſtle at large in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> where he compareth Chriſt dying with thoſe Sacrifices, and ſheweth the inſufficiency of them in reſpect of Chriſts once Oblation of himſelf, which compariſon would be weak and abſurd if Chriſts Death was not propitiatory; No wonder then if the devil hath raiſed up blaſphemous Heretiques to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw this Doctrine, becauſe in this is contained that happy Reconciliation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and a ſinner; In that Chriſt ſhed his bloud to atone for us is the whole hope and comfort of the Church of God.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, <hi>The holy and juſt nature of God against ſinne was ſuch,</hi>
               <note place="margin">V. The neceſſity of it.</note> 
               <hi>that there was a neceſſity of Chriſts ſacrificing himſelf upon the Croſſe for us</hi>; It's hotly diſputed whether God might have forgiven ſinne abſolutely without Chriſts Death, or by any other way then by Satisfaction; But when all is ſaid, it's acknowledged it is the moſt convenient way, and if we do ſuppoſe that God would ſave man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde no other way but by juſtice as well as mercy, then it was abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that Chriſt ſhould become man, ſeeing no meer man could compenſate God, neither could the Obedience of any man have delighted God as much as <hi>Adams</hi> diſobedience did offend him; Therefore it's highly derogatory from Chriſt which <hi>Durand</hi> ſaith, that if it had pleaſed God it might have been that as by <hi>Adams</hi> diſobedience all <hi>were made ſinners,</hi> ſo by the ſame <hi>Adams</hi> Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience repenting and beleeving, all might have been made Righteous.<note place="margin">The proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Chriſts Sacrifice.</note>
            </p>
            <p>In the ſecond place Conſider the properties of this Sacrifice.</p>
            <p>And Firſt, <hi>It had infinite worth in it</hi>; Inſomuch that had God ordained it ſo,<note place="margin">I. It hath infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite worth in it.</note> it would have procured Reconciliation for all the ſins of all men in the world, yea, if there had been a thouſand worlds of ſinners; This is that which Divines ſay, That it was a ſufficient price and ranſome for all, though not efficacious:
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:65216:276"/>
Though therefore many are damned, this doth not ariſe from any weakneſſe or inſufficiency in Chriſts Death, but from the wickedneſſe and rebellion of men who refuſe the means to improve this Ranſome for their good; There is infinite worth in it and that upon a threefold reſpect.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The Perſon offering,</hi> who is God as well as man, So that what dignity and worth the divine Nature can put upon it, that it is ſure to have; Oh that Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief and diſtruſt ſhould ever overwhelm any Godly ſoul! Doth not the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle triumph, and ſay, <hi>Who can lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect?</hi> Rom. 2. <hi>It's Chriſt that died</hi>; Though the divine nature could not ſuffer, yet he that ſuffered was God as well as man, and ſo it is to be accounted of infinite worth; This is more then the Obedience of Men and Angels put together.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>It is of infinite worth in reſpect of the gracious readineſſe and willingneſſe of him who did utter it</hi>; Chriſt received grace into his humane nature without meaſure, and ſo this being the gracious offering of him, who was God and man, it muſt have neceſſary acceptance.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It had infinite worth <hi>in reſpect of the thing uttered,</hi> which was no leſſe <hi>then the precious body and bloud of Chriſt himſelf,</hi> he thought not thoſe preparatory ſufferings and agonies enough, but he conſummates all by his <hi>Death</hi>; Oh then let not the trembling ſinner fear the inſufficiency of the ranſome, doubt not whether every farthing be paid, Say not, though ſuch ſins may be diſcharged, yet can this that I have committed, Can the bloud of Chriſt cover this ſinne as well as others?</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">II. Though <hi>Chriſt</hi> offered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiae yet the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication muſt be as God hath appointed.</note>Secondly, Conſider <hi>that though Chriſt offered up himſelf as a Sacrifice, yet the application of it muſt be in ſuch a way that God hath appointed</hi>; It's not enough that there is a potion which will cure all diſeaſes, but it muſt be taken in that way which the Phyſician doth preſcribe, and thus though Chriſt offered up himſelf to reconcile God to man, <hi>yet this is not done till by faith it be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved</hi>; As the bloud of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Sacrifice was to be <hi>ſprinkled with hyſop</hi>; Thus the bloud of Chriſt ere it doth waſh away our ſins, muſt by Faith be ſprinkled upon the ſoul, and therefore it's not altogether here as it is when a man is indebted and lying in priſon, one comes and paieth the debt for him; This man is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſed without any more a do; There is no further thing required but the ſetting of him at l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>berty, for though Chriſt hath thus offerrd up himſelf for the pardon of ſinnes, yet the Father hath made ſuch an appointment, that <hi>this price ſhould reach to none but thoſe that beleeve,</hi> and therefore this Doctrine doth not give the leaſt ſecurity to any man to ſinne, for though Chriſt died, yet his bloud may do thee no good: Thou maiſt lie roaring in hell to all Eternity for all this, becauſe thou art not one who doth partake of this death; Know the godly themſelves while unconverted and abiding in their ſinnes have not that actuall benefit of Juſtification which cometh effectually by Chriſts Death.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">III. Chriſts bloud waſheth away not only the guilt of ſin but the filth of it.</note>Thirdly, <hi>Hence Chriſts bloud is not only cleanſing and waſhing away the guilt of ſinne but the filth of it</hi>; The Apoſtle <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. ſaid, <hi>that he died to redeem us a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar people to himſelf, zealous of good works</hi>; So that there is none can pleade the juſtifying efficacy of Chriſts Death, that have not alſo the ſanctifying effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of it, as it followeth in the Text, <hi>That they might be ſanctified:</hi> and this will pull up by the very roots all that carnal confidence that moſt have, That come to Chriſts Death as unto a common Sanctuary; It's true I am a grievous ſinner, but Chriſt died, Chriſt was made a Sacrifice; but what is this to thee who walloweſt in thy filthy luſts? Thou art full of thy noiſome ſinnes, and if Chriſts Death did belong to thee, it would waſh thee, it would purifie thee; Do not think Chriſts bloud can be ſprinkled on thee for the pardon of ſinne, and not for the waſhing away the filth of it; This is the ruine of thouſands, they divide Chriſt, and ſeparate one effect of his death from another.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="513" facs="tcp:65216:276"/>Fourthly, <hi>Though Chriſt did but once offer up himſelf,</hi>
               <note place="margin">IV. The vertue of his Sacrifice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bides for ever.</note> 
               <hi>yet the vertue and power of it doth abide for ever</hi>; It's not neceſſary that Chriſt ſhould be alwaies dying, therefore he is ſaid to be <hi>a Prieſt for ever,</hi> yea, this Death of Chriſt did extend to all the Godly that lived before his Sufferings; <hi>Abel, Abraham,</hi> and all in the Old Teſtament, had no other Sacrifice to pleaſe God with, but this; It is noted by a Learned man, that therefore <hi>Cains</hi> Sacrifice was not accepted becauſe he did not as <hi>Abel,</hi> offer ſuch a propitiatory Sacrifice as was a Type of Chriſt, but reſted in his own duties and works; yea, it's thought God by covering <hi>Adams</hi> nakedneſſe with skins of Beaſts, did thereby teach Chriſts Righteouſneſſe; Look then upon the bloud of Chriſt as powerfully working, as if to day he had been crucified; It works as a <hi>morall Cauſe</hi> by Covenant and agreement with the Father, and therefore it doth as ſtrongly work as ever,</p>
            <p>Fifthly, <hi>It's continually uſeful and neceſſary, ſeeing we renew ſinnes daily,</hi>
               <note place="margin">V. It's continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſeful.</note> and therefore run into new infirmities conſtantly, therefore it behoveth us to apply this medicine continually: If a man had been a hundred times ſtung by Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, he was as often to look upon the exalted Serpent to be healed, if there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we fall into the mire daily, we need waſhing as often, if we get noiſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe upon us, this bloud muſt daily clenſe us, and certainly we may all ſay with <hi>Peter, Not my feet but my whole body alſo</hi>; Let that be waſhed; Doth not every part of us get ſome new pollution? Are not hearts, affections, and mindes conſtantly polluted? If ſo, we cannot be a moment without the application of it as often as we breathe, we need the Sprinkling of Chriſts bloud.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, <hi>We are to Conſider the certain ſucceſſe and prevalency of it</hi>; No ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er did the Meſſengers ſay <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi> was dead, but <hi>Davids</hi> anger was removed:<note place="margin">VI. It's prevalent with God.</note> When the deſtroying Angel ſeeth this bloud, he will paſſe by, if <hi>Moſes</hi> his prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er could ſo much prevail with God, that he ſaith, <hi>Let me alone</hi>; and <hi>Lot</hi> was ſo accepted that the Angel cannot deſtroy <hi>Sodom</hi> till he be removed; Then how powerful and prevalent muſt Chriſts bloud be.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, <hi>This Sacrifice is that which Chriſt preſents to his Father</hi>;<note place="margin">VII. It's that Chriſt preſents to his Father.</note> The Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans wold have Chriſt performing his Prieſtly Office only in Heaven, but it's plain he did it on earth, only what he once did, he conſtantly preſents to his Father, and the minding of God with this is a farre more efficacious thing, then that of the Rainbow, God when he beholds this will not again drown the world, and when he looketh on Chriſt will not condemn the humbled ſinner. Therefore Chriſt is deſcribed <hi>Rev.</hi> 10. with a <hi>Rainbow upon his head,</hi> to ſignifie as ſome think the pacificatory vertue that is in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Eighthly, <hi>The purity of the Sacrifice is not to be forgotten</hi>; He is called the pure and ſpotleſſe <hi>Lamb,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.19. As it behoved us to have a Prieſt without ſinne,<note place="margin">VIII. The purity of it.</note> So a Sacrifice without any defect, otherwiſe that Sacrifice would have needed another, and ſo there would have been no end; Therefore though all we can offer which is ours be full of blemiſhes, yet when we preſent Chriſt by Faith, then there is no fault to be found.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, <hi>The vertue of this Sacrifice is to make us like Chriſt himſelf</hi>;<note place="margin">IX. The vertue of it.</note> he thinketh it not enough to be King and Prieſt himſelf, but he maketh us alſo <hi>Kings and Prieſts for ever</hi>; We offer up <hi>Praiers</hi> and <hi>Praiſes</hi> to him, and by him we conquer all our ſpiritual Enemies, The devil and our luſts are ſubdued, Such glory have all they that are partakers of this Sacrifice.</p>

and then conſequently, <hi>A ſetting apart, and dedicating our ſelves wholly unto God by living unto him,</hi> and thence obſerve,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That Chriſt died not only for our Juſtification, but Sanctification alſo.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Obſerv.</hi> Chriſt died not only for our juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on alſo. Concerning this point con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,</note> He made himſelf a Sacrifice, not onely to remove the <hi>guilt</hi> of ſinne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but to remove and ſubdue the <hi>power</hi> of it, not onely to make us happy, but alſo holy.</p>
            <p>Let us conſider, <hi>What is implied in this, That Sanctification comes by Chriſts death.</hi> And</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>We are to know that Chriſt is the Cauſe of our Sanctification ſeveral wayes,</hi> partly <hi>efficiently,</hi> for not only the Father and the Spirit, but Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf alſo is the cauſe of all the holineſſe we have,<note place="margin">I. How many wayes is the Chriſt is the cauſe of our Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</note> and therefore he is called <hi>the life,</hi> becauſe he gives all ſupernatural life unto his, and is compared to the <hi>vine, Joh.</hi> 15. becauſe as the branch ſeparated from the Vine can bring forth no fruit; ſo neither is a man able without Chriſt to do the leaſt holy action; he is alſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Head,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> 1. <hi>Of his fulneſſe we are all ſaid to receive.</hi> Thus as God in the courſe of nature is the authour of every natural gift, therefore it's ſaid, <hi>In him we live, and move, and have our being,</hi> Act. 17.28. So in the way of grace, Chriſt is <hi>the authour and finiſher, as of our faith,</hi> ſo of every holy work in us The <hi>Author,</hi> Heb. 12.2. and therefore we cannot ſo much as begin or meet Chriſt, he muſt prevent us; and the <hi>finiſher</hi>; for although we have begun, yet we have not the ſame manutenency and powerfull preſervation, what we have begun to build would immediately fall to the ground. Thus Chriſt is the <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega</hi> of our ſpiritual life.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Chriſt is the meritorious cauſe of our Sanctification, and therefore not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſin, but holineſſe and zeal is made the conſequent of Chriſts death</hi>; And the Apoſtle doth not only <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.8. ſhew, that we are juſtified by Chriſt, but alſo that the <hi>body of ſinne is mortified thereby.</hi> Thus <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. what Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication that Apoſtate had, is attributed to the blood of Chriſt; Chriſt then hath as efficaciouſly merited holineſſe, as happineſſe, <hi>He died to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the workes of the devil</hi>; now our captivity to him, was not onely in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of <hi>guilt,</hi> but that bondage and ſlavery we were in to all luſts; and therefore thoſe two benefits are like <hi>Caſtor</hi> and <hi>Pollux,</hi> one cannot be without the other.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Chriſt is in ſome large and improper ſenſe, called <hi>the formal cauſe of the good in us,</hi> an aſſiſtant <hi>form,</hi> not <hi>informing,</hi> that is, Chriſt received and applied by faith, doth in a moſt inward and intimate manner live in us, and thereby ſtrengtheneth us; ſo the Apoſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. <hi>I no longer live, but Chriſt in me.</hi> Here you ſee Chriſt liveth in a godly man, for by faith we are united unto him, and thus Chriſt becomes our Head, from whom we have all ſpiritual influx: Now an head is a conjoyned and united cauſe, made one with the body, and thus is Chriſt and his Church; and therefore is that ſimilitude of an Head and the Body ſo often uſed.</p>
            <p n="4">4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Chriſt is the final cauſe of our Sanctification,</hi> that is, we are made holy to this end, both that we might ſhew forth the praiſes and glory of Chriſt, as our Redeemer, as alſo that we ſhould live to him, and ſet all our affections and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires upon him, deſiring with <hi>Paul, To know nothing but Chriſt crucified,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.1.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>In that by Chriſts death we are ſanctified, there is implied,</hi>
               <note place="margin">II. What is impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in our being ſanctified by Chriſt.</note> 
               <hi>That we of our ſelves are very impure and unclean, that we are like ſo many noiſome dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hils.</hi> For our being unſanctified, doth imply,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Our filthineſs or uncleanneſs; this is the ſtate of every man till ſanctified by Chriſt, he is like an unclean leper, his riches, his honours, his greatneſs, his parts, his morality doth not free him from this impurity, ſo that he ought to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor himſelf as a <hi>monſter,</hi> as a <hi>toad.</hi> This is the foundation of all our miſery, that
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:65216:278"/>
we doe not look upon our ſelves as ſo many vile carkaſſes, as ſo many dead dogs. Till this be laid as the firſt principle, Chriſt is not prized, San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification is not ſought after: Oh therefore ſtand like the leprous perſon afarre off, and cry out, <hi>I am unclean, unclean</hi>? Thou wouldſt be aſhamed as <hi>Adam</hi> was to come with this nakedneſſe and filthineſſe upon thee into Gods preſence.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Being unſanctified, doth imply, That even the holy things we are imployed about, do not ſanctifie us, but we rather pollute them.</hi> Hag. 2. He that was unclean, though he touched the holy things, though he ranne to the Temple and the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, yet he was not thereby ſanctified, but he rather polluted them, and thus while a man is unſanctified, thoſe very duties, prayers and ordinances, he doth runne unto, will condemn him, as appeareth <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1. by that ſevere expoſtulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with them, that abounded in their Sacrifices, yet did not waſh them or make them clean.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>There is implied an utter unfitneſſe and indiſpoſition to any good work</hi>; as on the other ſide, a veſſel ſanctified was <hi>meet for his maſters uſe</hi>; So that till we be ſanctified by Chriſts blood, we have no fitneſſe for any holy duty, iron can as well ſwim and logs flie, as a natural man be prepared to do that which is holy and ſupernatural.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">III. What may be inferred from our being ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified by Chriſts ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying himſelf.</note>Thirdly, <hi>That our Sanctification is here attributed to Chriſts Sanctification of himſelf,</hi> we ſee,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That the initials and beginnings of Sanctification, are wholly from him.</hi> Some have endeavoured to make the very Heathens partakers of ſome kinde of ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, making a <hi>pietas pagana,</hi> as well as <hi>Chriſtiana,</hi> but they are to fear leſt that might be applied to them, which <hi>Bernard</hi> did to <hi>Abailardus, Dum ſudat Platonem facere Chriſtianum, ſcriptum facit Ethnicum.</hi> There is no ſanctification but where Chriſt is, and Chriſt and his body cannot be ſeparated, as the gold onely in the Temple was ſanctified; and this is good to lay us low, and to make us admiring of the grace of Chriſt, How is it thou art ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and others remain prophane, polluted like bruit beaſts, who hath made this difference? Who infuſed this holy nature into thee? Waſt thou not as loathſom, as wallowing in the filth of thy luſts, as others till Chriſts blood did cleanſe thee?</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Not only the initials, but progreſſives, and conſummatives in Sanctification, are to be attributed to his Sanctification.</hi> Therefore you heard him called the <hi>fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſher,</hi> as well as the <hi>authour of our faith</hi>; and the Diſciples, though already ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified, yet are ſtill more and more to be ſanctified. It's true, here is a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between our firſt Sanctification, and the increaſe of it at firſt, we were wholly <hi>paſſive</hi>; Chriſt found us dead in our ſinnes, and wallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in our blood, but afterwards he findes us alive, onely needing his continual <hi>exciting and quickening grace</hi>; Therefore <hi>Paul,</hi> though convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet ſtill lives a life of faith in Chriſt; we need Chriſt all the day long: How unholy, earthly, dull and lumpiſh is thy heart, if Chriſt did not conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſanctifie it?</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">IV. Wherein the truth of San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification lieth.</note>Fourthly, <hi>This Sanctification purchaſed by Chriſt muſt be in truth and integrity</hi>; ſo Chriſt addeth, <hi>ſanctified in the truth,</hi> that is, <hi>truly,</hi> in oppoſition to thoſe <hi>le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal</hi> and <hi>ceremonial ſanctifications</hi> which did only cleanſe the body, but not reach to the ſoul. Although in the New Teſtament we have no ſuch external bodily Sanctification, yet ſtill there is an outward Sanctification, and an inward, both coming by Chriſt, and one ſeparable from the other. Thus you heard, the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate is ſaid to be ſanctified by the blood of Chriſt, which was not indeed and truly ſo, for then he would not have totally fallen off, but in reſpect of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal adminiſtration. Hence 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.2. the whole Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> though afterwards reproved for many ſinfull practices, yet are called <hi>ſanctified,</hi> and
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:65216:278"/>
that partly, becauſe of the external diſpenſation of the Ordinances which they enjoyed: So that there is a Sanctification external, and a Sanctification inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall: External, is when by our Baptiſme, and Chriſtian profeſſion: We ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge our ſelves ſeparated from the world to live unto God; but internal is when we are ſo <hi>indeed:</hi> How ſhall we call the prophane, ungodly perſon, a ſanctified one? Look to the truth of Sanctification here mentioned in the Text. Now the truth of it lieth,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. <hi>In the manner of working of it.</hi> The Spirit of God by the Word doth thus ſanctifie; therefore ſome underſtand this in the Text, by the truth, as former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly our Saviour prayed. God himſelf is the onely Authour of Sanctification. We cannot make our ſelves holy, no more then we can make our ſelves men, yet God works not in the order of grace immediately, no more then in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of nature, where he makes uſe of ſecond cauſes. Thus in the working of grace, he appointeth ſecond means, as the Miniſtry and Ordinances; and therefore <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. 3. ſaith, They were Miniſters by whom the <hi>Corinthians</hi> did beleeve; and there is no better diſcovery of true Sanctification, then to examine the manner and way how thou haſt received it; for if the Spirit of God by the Word hath wrought it in thee, then fear not, this is of a more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and ſupernatural being, then what morality or principles of civility can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline unto thee; As Chriſt himſelf was in his bodily nature conceived by the holy Ghoſt in an extraordinary manner. Thus is <hi>every one ſanctified in an high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and more ſublime way, then all the moral and prudential dictates of nature can carry us unto:</hi> Oh then prove thy ſelf, what hath the Spirit of God and his Word done unto thee! That was not more wonderfull in thoſe who had a prophetical Spirit, then in ſuch who are ſanctified. To ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble men to ſpeak with ſtrange Tongues, is not more admirable, then to give a man a ſtrange heart to what he had once, and ſtrange in reſpect of others.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. <hi>It's true Sanctification, when it hath the univerſality and integrity of all parts, which is the whole Image of God,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> prayeth, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5. <hi>I pray God ye be ſanctified throughout in ſpirit, ſoul and body.</hi> This work of Sanctification, it's an entire, compleat, harmonical compages of all holineſſe, take any part of it away, and you diſſolve the whole fabrick. It's true, Sanctification though it have not perfect and compleat degrees, but not true, if it want any eſſential parts, and therefore called the <hi>Image of God,</hi> which cannot be one grace, no more then a man can be a man in one part, and a beaſt in another, but the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteme of all.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. <hi>It's true Sanctification in the permanency and continuance of it.</hi> Perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance doth not make Sanctification to be true, but the truth of Sanctification makes it perſevere: Perſeverance is an effect, not a cauſe of true Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.19. <hi>They went from us, becauſe they were not of us</hi>; As leaves fall from the Tree, when they have no more of their wonted nouriſhment; and this diſcovers the falſhood of thoſe who appear ſanctified onely in ſome fits, and upon ſome ſad afflictions on them.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 4. <hi>Truth of Sanctification is diſcovered by the purity of our aims and ends.</hi> They love God, they obey him from ſuch holy grounds as are ſuitable to the ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nature: As the hungry man loveth his food, becauſe of his naturall deſire to it. Thus a ſanctified man loveth and doeth that which is holy for holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe ſake.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> 5. <hi>True Sanctification is growing, and proficient every day more and more.</hi> That which hath ſolid root doth not wither, but ripens and flouriſheth by the Sunne-beams. The Apoſtles though already ſanctified, yet are ſtill to be more ſanctified; and certainly ſuch is the ſweetneſſe and peace which Sanctification
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:65216:279"/>
brings, that it's no wonder if the heart be never ſatisfied, but ſtill crieth like the horſleech, <hi>Give, Give.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>True Sanctification will make a man diligently and fruitfully improve all the inſtituted means for the increaſe of it, becauſe the Spirit of God works holineſſe</hi>; Therefore he is fearfull to grieve it: Becauſe the Miniſtry is to make more holy, therefore he prizeth it, and labours to profit by it, yea, becauſe afflictions are ſent by God to ſanctifie the heart, therefore he is humble under them, and prayeth more earneſtly for the Sanctification of them, then the removal of them.</p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>This Sanctification, though inchoate and imperfect here, yet ſhall be perfected hereafter in Heaven.</hi> Chriſts prayer, Chriſts Spirit, Chriſts me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit will at laſt obtain their compleat and ultimate effect, which is full San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification in Heaven, when there will be no more need to pray for further San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> Hath Chriſt thus merited, and pray'd for Sanctification? Then know, Chriſt hath done nothing to encourage prophane and ungodly men: Chriſt died not, neither is he a Redeemer or Saviour, but to ſuch who are made holy. This may amaze and aſtoniſh all ſuch, as divide the effects of Chriſts death, yea and divide Chriſt himſelfe; They look upon him, as a Saviour, but not as a Sanctifier; They would have his blood to waſh away the puniſhment of their ſinnes, but not the filth and pollution of them: Oh let the ungodly know, <hi>They ſet up an Idol-Chriſt; There is no ſuch Christ as pardoneth, but ſanctifieth not alſo!</hi> Come then more earneſtly to be healed of thy ſoul-pollution, then they did of bodily diſeaſes.</p>

                  <hi>Doct.</hi> That Chriſt though God, yet as man did pray unto the Father.</note> This Point about Chriſts Praying is worthy of our knowledge and right underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, For the <hi>Arians</hi> and <hi>Socinians</hi> did from hence argue, that Chriſt was not God, it being abſurd they ſay for him to pray who could do what he pleaſed, even as it's abſurd to ſay, that God can pray, ſeeing he is omnipotent, and hath no Superiour; Yea, ſome of the Ancient Fathers have not ſpoken ſo ſoundly in this Point; <hi>Hilary</hi> makes it to be but a kinde of holy ſimulation, that Chriſt
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:65216:280"/>
praied, and generally it's made a reaſon why he praied that he might give us an example; But although this be one ſubordinate end, yet there were other more principal ends.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <note place="margin">Upon what grounds Chriſt who was God as well as man did pray.</note>1. Therefore let us Conſider upon what ground Chriſt did pray.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The difference between his Praier and ours. He praied then for himſelf and his Church.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. <hi>Becauſe as man he was not omnipotent,</hi> and ſo his humane will was not able to accompliſh the things he deſired, for although as God he could do all things, in which reſpect he wrought Miracles, and did them not by Petition, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, but by his own power and in his own Name, yet as man, ſo, what he deſired by his humane will, by that he could not ſimply accompliſh it, ſo that in this reſpect it was that Chriſt as man did pray.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. <hi>As man Christ was ſubject to the Law of God,</hi> and ſo was bound to give that worſhip and Religious Service to God which the Law did require, ſo that when Chriſt praied he did it as fulfilling a duty, he had voluntarily ſubmitted unto; Even as when he came to be baptized, he told <hi>John, it behoved him to fullfill all Righteouſneſſe,</hi> Matth. 3.15. It was part of his Righteouſneſſe to be baptized, becauſe as man he was made a member of the Church; Therefore <hi>Matth.</hi> 4. he brings that command of worſhiping and ſerving God alone, as reaching to him, intimating he was bound by that Command as well as other men: So <hi>Joh</hi> 4. he tels the Woman of <hi>Samaria, We worſhip, we know not what</hi>: He puts himſelf in the Number of Worſhipers, So that Praier being part of Gods worſhip, and a chief part of it, no wonder if Chriſt was conſtant in it: Hence we reade of ſpending nights in Praier, yea, in his Troubles, his Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers were accompanied with <hi>ſtrong Cries</hi> and <hi>Agonies,</hi> and the more they encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, the more earneſtly he praied.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. <hi>He praied, becauſe though all things were due unto him, yet by the Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God he could not be partaker of them but by Praier</hi>; So that though the Glorification of his body was due unto him from the beginning of his Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet he is to come to it by way of Prayer; Hence in this Chapter he doth by many Arguments ſeek for it at the Fathers hands: Thus <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. when God there declares his will of making him King over his Church, and giving the Nations of the world for an Inheritance to him, it's ſaid, <hi>Ask of me, and I will give thee,</hi> Chriſt is to ask and pray for ſuch things, So that in this reſpect Chriſt praied, even as all the Godly do, though God hath appointed and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to beſtow ſuch glorious things upon his penple, yet it is by way of prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er that they muſt be poſſeſſed of them; God could give them otherwiſe; Neither do our praiers or Chriſts Praiers make God alter or change his minde, only praier is appointed by him as that <hi>medium</hi> whereby his purpoſe ſhall be brought to paſſe.</p>

            <p>Neither 3. <hi>Were Praiers to him as they are to us, means to quicken up and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite the heart,</hi> to make it more Heavenly and zealous; Prayer in us doth quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and excite a man, and takes off the ruſt upon his Soul; Chriſt was alwaies in contemplation and enjoyment of God, and therefore he did not need prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to make his ſoul aſcend higher to God.</p>
            <p>Hence in the fourth place, <hi>All the matter he could pray for in reference to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was concerning his body,</hi> and the further glorifying of that, for ſeeing it pleaſed him to take our body upon him in all the natural defects and infirmities thereof, ſinne only excepted, it was neceſſary that he ſhould not alwaies be in ſuch a paſſible mortal way, but riſe again to glory, dominion, and all honour; Now this Chriſt praied for as being to be obtained by praier as well as his Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings; He praied alſo for aſſiſtance and deliverance in thoſe agonies he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted with; But in reſpect of his praier for the Church, So he praied for their Sanctification, though not for his own, he praied <hi>Peters</hi> Faith might not fail; he praied God would not impute ſinne to ſome of thoſe who did crucifie him; Though he needed not ſuch Petitions, yet we do, and therefore in this reſpect Chriſt praied, in which we cannot imitate him, for he praied as he was to offer up himſelf a Sacrifice for our ſinnes, ſo it behoved him alſo to put up praier for his people; Thus you have heard how Chriſt was capable of Praier, though God.<note place="margin">What advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage Beleevers have by Chriſt.</note>

            <p>For 1. In the raiſing of <hi>Lazarus</hi> though he could have done it by an immediate Word, yet he wept, and was ſorely troubled; yea, he groaned twice, which were not ſimply groans of his Body in a natural way, but ſuch as were accompanied with Praier; Therefore he addeth, <hi>I know that thou hearest me alwaies</hi>; Though we do not reade of any Praier of Chriſts at that ſame time, yet the groans and the deſires of his Heart, they were Praier.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is Obſervable how thankfull Chriſt was for having his Prayer heard; The ſame Perſon who is obliged to give thanks, is alſo bound to pray: Thus <hi>John</hi> 6. Chriſt gave Thanks about that Refreſhment, though it was by Barley and ſome ſmall Fiſh; Chriſt himſelf giveth God thanks for that poor and courſe Diet: Oh what Thankfullneſſe ſhould this teach us, and ſtirre us up to expreſſe: And ſo in this Hiſtory, though the good he praied for did not immediately redound to him, but to <hi>Lazarus</hi> and his Siſters, yet Chriſt giveth thanks for it, ſo that Chriſt who prayeth for the good of Beleevers as his own good, So he giveth thanks likewiſe to God for Mercies and Bleſſings beſtowed on them as though they were his own mercies: If thou canſt not give God Thanks large and hearty e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for his diſcriminating Mercy in opening of thy Eyes, and paſſing by and leaving the Eyes of more prudent and honoured in the world blinde and ſhut up: Know that Chriſt hath alſo thanked the Father for this, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.21. Chriſt that praieth for all thy ſpiritual bleſſings, doth alſo praiſe the Father for them.</p>
            <p>But 3. That for which I brought this place is, That Chriſt doth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay, That <hi>the Father heard him,</hi> but <hi>I know,</hi> demonſtrating the Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of this, <hi>and that he heareth him alwaies</hi>: This ſuppoſeth Chriſt is alwaies praying, for he that is alwaies heard, is ſuppoſed to be alwaies powring forth his Petitions: And further If you ſay that Chriſt praied, <hi>That the Cup might paſſe away,</hi> yet he was not heard in that prayer, it is eaſily anſwered, That was not Chriſts Abſolute but his Conditionall pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: It was an Expreſſion of his Will <hi>ut natura,</hi> not <hi>ut ratio</hi>; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he addeth, <hi>Not my Will, but thy Will be done</hi>: Hence <hi>Hebrews</hi> 5.7. it is ſaid, <hi>He offered up Prayers with ſtrong Cryes to him that was able to ſave him from Death, and was heard in what he feared</hi>; Though he dyed, yet was heard in that Prayer becauſe Death had not any Dominion o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver him.</p>

This might be repreſented in that cuſtom amongſt the Jews, when the ſoul of every man, whether rich or poor did pay the ſame ranſome, <hi>Exod.</hi> 30.12.

                  </gap>nd or free, but all are one in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> Chriſt in his Mediatory works looks upon all as one: Even as it is with Gods providence in this univerſe. It's fully intent upon every one creature. There is not the leſt worm or flie, but Gods provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence preſerveth it as well as it doth the moſt glorious Angel, and as it is ſaid uſually, Gods providence is ſo intent upon all the whole Word <hi>univerſis,</hi> as if he did not attend <hi>ſingulis</hi> to every particular, and yet on the other ſide, it's ſo
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:65216:282"/>
incumbent on <hi>ſingulis,</hi> as if it were not to the <hi>univerſis:</hi> Even thus it is with Chriſt, his care and love is ſo indulged to any one beleever, that you would think there were no other believers, you would think his thoughts were not upon the Church in general, but on this particular, and yet at the ſame time Chriſts inſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd watchfulneſſe is ſo over the whole Church, that one would think, that he had not time or leiſure to minde the condition of every private Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>To open this Doctrine, it's good to conſider theſe things:</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, <hi>That Chriſt being God as well as man,</hi>
               <note place="margin">In what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects Chriſt did as much for one belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver as another.</note> 
               <hi>and ſo a Mediatour in both Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, did know all thoſe who were given unto him by the Father, he knew the charge and truſt that was committed unto him:</hi> Even all that have been, or ſhall be, and therefore as the High-prieſt had the names of the twelve Tribes on his breaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate; Thus our Mediatour reſembleth him, for he hath the name of every one, he is the good Shepherd, who as he did lay down his life for, ſo alſo he muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily know every one of them. This then is to be taken notice of, that the Father gave ſuch a number of perſons, neither more nor leſſe unto Chriſt, to purchaſe their ſalvation; and every one of theſe he did exactly know, for to him as God, all things paſt and to come are as preſent. And therefore though theſe in the Text are to believe in the future, and ſo have no preſent being, yet they are here comprehended in Chriſts prayer; But of this truth more in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Deſcription, which is of the circumſtance of time.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, <hi>As Chriſt in a Mediatory way did thus receive equally every one to his charge and truſt, ſo in the diſcharge of it, he had an equal reſpect to all.</hi> Chriſt did not will the ſalvation of one beleever more than another: he did not intend his blood in the efficacy of it, more for <hi>Paul</hi> or <hi>Peter,</hi> then he did for <hi>Mary Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalen</hi> a great ſinner, if then we ſpeak <hi>quoad affectum</hi> and <hi>intentionem,</hi> not <hi>quoad efficaciam,</hi> and <hi>fructum</hi>; So Chriſt was equally a Mediatour to all that are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him by the Father. Though we judge that a moſt unſavoury and unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Doctrine, that holds, Chriſt did <hi>intentionally</hi> and <hi>equally</hi> die for all; for <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> as well as <hi>Peter</hi>; That Chriſt had no more love in his death to one then another; yet if we ſpeak of thoſe who are intereſſed in him ſpiritually; ſo it's true, <hi>Chriſt died equally for all that are his, he made no difference in his Mediatory acts, his eye and love, with all that he did was to one, as well as another.</hi> None can ſay, he is my Chriſt more then anothers, he intended me in his death more then another. This you heard proved by the Apoſtle, when he ſaid, in Chriſt Jeſus, there was no reſpect of perſons, relations, or other differences.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Hence thirdly, <hi>Even in reſpect of the effects and fruits of his Mediatory love, in ſome particulars all are alike.</hi> There is no difference between one and the other: As for inſtance, in <hi>Juſtification,</hi> all beleevers ſtand alike juſtified through the blood of Chriſt, all are accepted of, and beloved in Chriſt alike. This we truly maintain, when againſt Papiſts we affirm, That any poor, weak woman, yea one that hath been a grievous ſinner, yet if beleeving in Chriſt, is equally juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi>; and the ground is, becauſe the reaſon of our Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication is without us in reſpect of Chriſt, not in our ſelves; ſo that as Chriſt is every where the ſame, thus muſt our Juſtification be every where the ſame. It's true, one is more juſtified then another <hi>extenſively,</hi> but not <hi>intenſively,</hi> that is, one hath more ſin forgiven then another. <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> had more forgiven her then the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> but <hi>intenſively,</hi> as our Juſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fication doth conſiſt in Gods favour and acceptation, ſo they were both equal. Again, if we ſpeak of the <hi>application of Chriſts righteouſneſs,</hi> ſo indeed there is a great difference; for though Chriſts righteouſneſſe be the ſame, yet becauſe ſome receive this with a ſtronger faith then others, and becauſe the application of this righteouſneſſe is in us, not according to the latitude and worth that it is in Chriſt, but according to our neceſſity and indigency; Therefore we may ſay, Some partake of it more then another. Though Chriſts righteouſneſſe be in it ſelf the ſame to all: Even
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:65216:283"/>
as the light of the Sun is the ſame to every Starre, though one Starre partaketh more of it, then another. This then muſt needs encourage every believer, for he hath the ſame Chriſt, the ſame righteouſneſſe to offer unto God for ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction as any <hi>Paul</hi> or <hi>Abraham,</hi> though the father of the faithfull, had. If we were to come in our graces and duties to be accepted of, then we might truely ſay, I am not comparable to ſuch worthies, I cannot ſpeed ſo well, as thoſe that have more eminency, but though I have not the ſame grace with <hi>Paul,</hi> yet I have the ſame Chriſt with <hi>Paul,</hi> the ſame righteouſneſſe he would be found in, the ſame alſo I deſire to be found in. Thus our righteouſneſſe is alike in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, <hi>In the application of Chriſts benefits, there is no regard to external temporal differences.</hi> Chriſt doth not communicate himſelf to a Chriſtian for any external conſideration, nor are his favours diſpenſed with ſuch references, but according to their ſpiritual capacities: Hence it comes about, that ſome poor, weak Chriſtian, may enjoy far more of God and Chriſt, then the richeſt man, or the learnedſt man that is in the world, becauſe Chriſt diſpenſeth himſelf in a ſpiritual way, becauſe they are his members, and believe in him, not for acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental reſpects: Thus Chriſt ſaith, <hi>I ſtand at the door and knock,</hi> Rev. 3.20. <hi>if any man open I will come in, and ſup with him</hi> Chriſt will come to a poor mans houſe, and knock there, and will ſup with him: The meaning is, he will mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt himſelf in a gracious comfortable way to ſuch an one, let him be never ſo contemptible: Know then, to partake of Chriſt, and to have intimate fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with him, is not according to the manners of great Kings and Potentates in the earth: It's not here as with <hi>Ahaſhuerus,</hi> none might come into his preſence, but ſuch as were perfumed, and gloriouſly prepared for his preſence a long while together: Every believer may come boldly to the throne of grace, and call God, Father, and never be diſcouraged for external reſpects, God may make the poor mans cottage an heaven, whereas the rich mans palace or hall is many times an hell. Chriſt regards not great men, but good men, yet this muſt not be wreſted to an Anabaptiſtical errour, that becauſe in ſpiritual diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons Chriſt makes no ſuch difference; therefore the publique civil order that is between rich and poor, honourable and baſe, is to be confounded: No, Chriſts Goſpel doth not aboliſh humane policies and civil differences, but doth with great diligence command the renewing of them; Take an inſtance about a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving ſervant, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.2. <hi>They that have believing maſters, let them not deſpiſe them, becauſe they are brethren</hi>; Servants might think that by Chriſt all difference is taken away, why ſhould he be a ſervant, he hath as much of Chriſt, and is equally beloved of him with his Maſter? Oh, ſaith the Apoſtle, take heed of ſuch corruption, grace doth not confound and aboliſh relations and order, but rather confirmeth them, and commands to diſcharge them with the greater care.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly, <hi>Chriſts gracious promiſes which are for the main the ſubſtance of the Covenant of grace are equal to all his.</hi> He makes no difference, when he invites to pardon, to reſt, to come unto him. Indeed there are peculiar promiſes, which are made either to ſome high degrees of grace, or to ſome in their peculiar rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or ſufferings for Chriſt, which do not belong to all: But the Covenant of grace, which is the ſubſtance of all promiſes, that is offered and fulfilled in one believer as well as another: Thus the promiſe of being <hi>our Father,</hi> and we <hi>his people,</hi> of <hi>forgiving our ſinnes,</hi> and <hi>writing his Law in our hearts</hi>; They are made to every believer, <hi>All the Promiſes are in Chriſt Yea and Amen,</hi> 2 Cor. 1.20. and that to every one who cometh to him; This is alſo infinite comfort; It's ſin and thy deluſion, when thou ſayeſt, ſuch glorious promiſes do not belong to me, I am ſo poor and unworthy. Though others may claim them, yet I may not: Oh take heed of this! you charge Chriſt fooliſhly and ſinfully in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. Is it not his promiſe univerſal to every one that is <hi>heavy laden,</hi> that he will <hi>eaſe</hi> him? Why doſt thou except, when Chriſt doth not? So what

can be more clear then that, <hi>John</hi> 6.37. <hi>Him that cometh to me, I will in no wiſe caſt out</hi>; Let him be never ſo miſerable, ſo wretched, ſo ſinfull, if he cometh, he will in no wiſe caſt out, and leſt it ſhould be thought I cannot come, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins the verſe thus, <hi>All that the Father giveth me ſhall come to me,</hi> all ſhall come, not one will he forget; therefore Chriſt is deſcribed by this, <hi>That he will not break the bruiſed reed, nor quench the ſmoaking flax,</hi> Mat. 12.22. Yea the promiſe of <hi>perſeverance</hi> is to every godly man, as well as any; That as the leaſt Starre is as firmly ſet in it's orb, as the glorious Sunne, and there is no more danger of the falling of the one, then the other; Thus it is with the godly, even the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, weakeſt and moſt fearfull are as ſure to be kept by God to ſalvation, as the moſt ſtrong and heroical Chriſtians. It's not <hi>Peters</hi> courage or fortitude that kept him, for you ſee when preſerving grace had in ſome meaſure left him, he began to fall moſt dangerouſly, and would not have ſtopt, till he had come to the bottom of the hill, had not grace prevented him. This you muſt know, that it's not the graces or watchfulneſſe of a Chriſtian, that keeps him, as none can ſay, I have differenced my ſelf in reſpect of converſion; ſo neither I have made my ſelf to perſevere in reſpect of continuance of grace. This then is clear, That he who is truly a member of Chriſt, ſhall not periſh, though he be not the eye, or the hand, though he be the meaneſt, yet becauſe a member, he is inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable: Therefore <hi>John</hi> 10. <hi>None can pluck any out of my hand</hi>; All the ſheep of Chriſt are in his hand: It's not with Chriſt, as with ſome unnatural parents that dote on ſome of their children, but others, they care not for; Chriſt lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth all alike in reſpect of the ſubſtantials of grace; So that as every one is ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and every one ſhall be converted, ſo every one ſhall perſevere to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This is a precious truth, and ought to be received; for we think with our ſelves, my weakneſſes, my corruptions, my frailties, my carnal fears are ſo great, that I ſhall never prove faithfull in the hour of temptation: Oh remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that in this point of perſeverance Chriſt makes no difference between true believers, the weak ſhall hold out as well as the ſtrong!</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Sixthly, <hi>Chriſts protection, power and care is to one as well as another, though he may ſuffer ſome to be more afflicted.</hi> Some more afflicted, ſome more exerciſed then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, yet this ariſeth not from a leſſe love of Chriſt. That Parable of the loſſe of one ſheep, and the Shepherds leaving all to finde out that, ſignifieth, that Gods care and love is to anyone that needeth him; and therfore the temporal promiſes for the generality belong to every godly perſon; God hath promiſed, <hi>I wil never leave thee nor forſake thee,</hi> Heb. 13.5. There is no believer living, but he is to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply this promiſe as properly, as if he only were mentioned, or as if he were <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua</hi> to whom it was firſt perſonally made. And to this <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 8. when he argueth, <hi>He that giveth us Christ, ſhall he not give us all things elſe? And we are more then conquerours:</hi> No, Do not all thoſe glorious triumphs proceed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a ground common to every believer? May not every Chriſtian ſay ſo as well as <hi>Paul?</hi> Thus when it's ſaid, <hi>Caſt thy burden upon the Lord, for he careth for thee, and all things ſhall work for your good, and in nothing be carefull.</hi> This is bread for every childe; Indeed there are dogs, and there are ſwine, to whom this bread doth not belong, to whom this pearl is not to be caſt, but every childe may undoubtedly take it.</p>

            <head>SERMON CIV. That in ſome particulars the poor weak Christian hath more reſpect from Chriſt then the ſtrong one.</head>
            <epigraph>
               <bibl>JOH. 17.20.</bibl>
               <q>But for thoſe alſo that ſhall beleeve in me through their Word.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THe Doctrine obſerved was, <hi>That Chriſt in his Mediatory Office ſtood equally affected to the weakeſt beleever as well as the moſt eminent</hi>; In ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things we demonſtrated an equality.</p>
            <p>Before I come to ſhew the differentiall particulars, let me adde, <hi>That in ſome particulars the poor weak Chriſtian hath more love and affection from Chriſt then a ſtrong one</hi>; So that the weaker they are, the more they conclude of more grace and power to be ſhewed to them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Chriſt commonly ſheweth more pity and compaſſion to ſuch as are objects of greater want and indigency</hi>; Therefore you heard, <hi>the ſmoaking flax he would not quench</hi>; As the Shepherd doth gently leade thoſe Cattel that are great with young, and as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> obſerveth, that in nature Parents are ſtill carried with their greateſt affection to the childe that is youngeſt, becauſe that is moſt expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to want; Thus alſo doth Chriſt reſpect thoſe that are the meaneſt, the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, that have leaſt of comfort and leaſt of grace; Alas ſuch are the greateſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of pity; Do not therefore think that thy infirmities make God angry with thee if humbled for them, no, they provoke pity and compaſſion; As the Pſalmiſt ſpeaks, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 103. concerning Gods afflictions, that <hi>he remembers what man is,</hi> he doth not deal with him as if he were braſſe and iron, but as duſt and graſſe, So doth Chriſt, he knoweth thy weakneſſes, thy temptations, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he will mercifully conſider of thee; The Apoſtle giveth this reaſon, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.7. why the husband ſhould give honour to his wife, <hi>becauſe ſhe is the weaker veſſell,</hi> and certainly Chriſt takes this way with every Soul married to him, the weaker it is the more compaſſionate is his condeſcention to it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>His protection and preſervation of it is more peculiar and emphaticall</hi>; The weaker and more infirm thou art, the greater is Gods power and grace mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted in thee; Thus <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, the power of God was perfected in his infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and <hi>when he was weak, then he was ſtrong,</hi> 2 Chro. 22.10. This is Chriſts uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all way to magnifie his power and ſtrength moſt in thoſe that are the weakeſt of beleevers, and therefore it is that many times he leaveth thoſe that are ſtrong and eminent to their own ſelves, that ſo feeling their own infirmities they may be the fitter objects to glorifie Chriſts power; Hence when <hi>Peter</hi> was in his failing and decaying condition, then Chriſt praieth, <hi>that his faith may not fail</hi>; God that owneth himſelf to be the <hi>judge of the Widows, and the Father of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therleſſe,</hi> becauſe they are moſt expoſed to neceſſities, will much more ſhew this in a ſpiritual way to ſuch as have not the hopes or the encouragements as other godly men have.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="529" facs="tcp:65216:284"/>3. He doth commonly vouchſafe <hi>more inward comforts and evidences of his love to ſuch,</hi> giveth them more chearfulneſſe and joy; Even as you ſee in nature, a Childe is not exerciſed with thoſe cares and troubles that do moleſt when they come to years, but minde their ſport and play; Thus to new Converts God many times, revealeth much comfort and joy; They may have more then than ever afterwards in their life time; Then is the time of the Souls marriage to Chriſt, and no wonder if a Feaſt be provided for them, and their water be tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into wine.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>God doth in a ſingular manner keep them from thoſe exerciſes and temptations which many times he lets fall on thoſe that are more eminent,</hi> Joh. 26. when <hi>Peter</hi> was young <hi>he went whither he would,</hi> but when he was old then he ſhould be bound, Where there is ſpiritual ſtrength God puts a proportionable burthen; So that Chriſt in the diſpenſing of his exerciſes hath a reſpect alwaies to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of their graces, he will not lay a Giants burthen upon a Childes back, yea, ſuch is the wiſedom of Chriſt herein, that he doth prepare and fit his people by degrees for afflictions, as the timber lieth in water to he ſeaſoned by degrees for ſervice; There is a great difference in Gods providence to his own people, ſome are more tempted then others inwardly in their ſouls, Some again have far more outward troubles then others, and in all theſe ſtill regard is had to the ſtrength of his people; Chriſt being the head hath a reſpect to every member, and ſo knoweth what is the fitteſt exerciſe for it; Be not then inordinately caſt down with fears, fears about thy infirmities and weakneſſes, for if thou art weaker then others, thy burthen ſhall be lighter, and the leſſe thou haſt of thy ſelf, the more of Chriſts power will be in thee.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Though they be weak in many things, yet Chriſt makes them remarkably ſtrong in ſome other things</hi>; This is notable to conſider, that even ſuch who have been weak, yet in ſome paſſages have ſhewed more ſtrength and couragious actings of grace then others very glorious: Did not all the Apoſtles though the firſt fruits as it were of Gods Spirit for fear fly from Chriſt? When <hi>Mary</hi> followed him to the Croſſe; yea, <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea</hi> which came to Chriſt by night for fear, did afterwards publikely own Chriſt, and that when he was crucified, when were the greateſt diſcouragements; Hence the Apoſtle <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. exhorts in honour to prefer one another, becauſe there is no Chriſtian ſo weak but even the ſtrongeſt may be inferior to him in ſome reſpect, Comfort then thy ſelf in this that though weak, yet thou haſt ſometimes been ſo enabled to do thoſe things which yet o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have failed in.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>To thoſe that are weak God hath made glorious promiſes for the encreaſe of their grace</hi>; Thus the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah, He that is weak ſhall renew his strength like an Eagle, and ſhall not be faint,</hi> Iſa. 40.31. and thus they are ſaid to be <hi>bleſſed that hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and thirſt after Righteouſneſſe becauſe they ſhall be ſatisfied,</hi> Mat. 5. and by the Prophet <hi>Zechary, He that is feeble ſhall be like David, and David like an Angel of God,</hi> Zech. 12.8. So that the meaneſt Chriſtian may lift up his head with joy, for though thou art infirm, yet a glorious promiſe of ſtrength is made unto thee.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, <hi>God ſanctifieth theſe weakneſſes and infirmities unto them,</hi> So that they get more good by their weak grace then many times others do by their ſtrong; It's better to be a babe in grace, fearing to fall, then a preſumptuous man like <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> to think we ſhall alwaies ſtand; God ſuffers even ſtrong ones ſometimes to be overcome by Philiſtims, that ſo they may fly out of themſelves to the grace of God, and depend upon his power, Now the Sanctification of their weakneſſe of graces lieth in this.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>They are hereby more bumble and ſelf-emptied</hi>; They remember thoſe duties, <hi>He that ſtands, let him take heed he doth not fall, and be not high-minded but fear</hi>: Humility and ſelf-emptineſſe is a comely poſture for a Chriſtian, now none are more ſo, then ſuch who are ſenſible of their weakneſſe.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="530" facs="tcp:65216:285"/>2. <hi>Hereby Chriſt is advanced and exalted in his power,</hi> as the weak Childe laieth faſt hold on his Fathers arm; Thus the power and might of Chriſt is to none ſo welcome as thoſe that finde and feel themſelves falling, when the Diſciples are ready to ſink, then they cry our, Maſter help we periſh</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>They walk more thankefully to God,</hi> when the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were in a barren wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe, having no food or water but what God did wonderfully provide for them, then if ever they would be ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>; Thus when a childe of God wonders that under ſo many temptations and infirmities he did not this day or that day fall and break his peace with God, he will be provoked to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie God and admire his grace; The hungry Soul will be thankfull for every morſell of bread, and thus will the humble lowly Chriſtian apprehenſive of its own imbecilities glorifie God for every moments preſervation.</p>

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> As in the firſt place, Though Juſtification be alike, yet <hi>their Sanctification is not,</hi> one is made more holy then another; That as one Starre differs from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in glory, ſo one Chriſtian from another in grace; Hence ſome are called <hi>babes,</hi> others <hi>ſtrong men,</hi> Some are called <hi>carnal</hi> comparatively, others <hi>spiritual,</hi> Some are ſaid to be <hi>perfect</hi> not abſolutely but reſpectively; It's true, all the people of God are truly ſanctified, one is ſanctified as well as another, <hi>aequè</hi> but not <hi>aequalitèr,</hi> only the meaſure and degree is very different; Not that he who hath more may advance his power, and attribute glory to himſelf; No, <hi>What haſt thou that thou haſt not received?</hi> Not only the eſſence of grace but every degree thereof is from the grace of God; Therefore he that praied, <hi>help my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief,</hi> Mar. 9.24 argued that he could not have one degree of faith by his own power, only Chriſt muſt beſtow it on him.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. As ſanctifying grace is very differently given to beleevers, ſo <hi>thoſe common gifts which are for ſervice, Chriſt giveth them in much variety,</hi> Eph. 4. That all theſe gifts are the fruit of Chriſts death is plain, and therefore the Spirit of God is given by Chriſt to his Church upon his Aſcenſion, Now 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. The Apoſtle doth there excellently ſhew, that though there be diverſity of operations, yet there is ſtill but one ſpirit, and the Scripture much delights in the ſimilitude of a body, where there is diverſity of members with their peculiar operations, and it's hard for beleevers to be content with theſe various Adminiſtrations: Every member would be an Eye, Though Chriſt died equally for all, yet he did not give gifts and offices alike to all; This variety of gifts is repreſented by the Kings Daughter, whoſe cloathing was of <hi>needle work,</hi> and it ſhould not tend to envy or diviſion, but to mutuall profiting and helping of one another.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3 <hi>The means of grace are likewiſe differently adminiſtred,</hi> For although Chriſt died alike for all beleevers, yet the means of bringing them home are not alike, Some live under more powerfull means then others, Some have not the Spurs and encouragement that others have to that which is holy; Again, ſome live in clearer and more evidencing times of Gods grace then others, all thoſe that lived before Chriſts time are ſaid to be in the dark in compariſon of the Light that did ariſe by Chriſt; <hi>Many Kings and Righteous perſons deſired to ſee what the Apoſtles did, but could not</hi>; But though all have not the like means, yet there is not any one godly man, though in never ſuch remote and dark corners, but the converting grace of God will finde him out, and therefore that is not a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent reaſon which ſome, pleading for Chriſts death univerſall for all, when urged by this argument, That if Chriſt died for all, why then have not all the means of grace? why is not the Goſpel preached to every one, if Chriſt died for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one? They anſwer thus, That even thoſe who hold Chriſt died for all beleevers, yet grant that all beleevers have not the ſame means of grace, to ſome the Kingdom of heaven draweth nigh more manifeſtly and evidently then
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:65216:285"/>
to others; But this as I finde is inſufficient, becauſe though the means of grace to one beleever may be more then another in reſpect of meaſure and degrees of Light, yet not of efficacy; That little means they have is bleſſed by God to be as effectuall as the moſt eminent and glorious means, whereas by their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion Chriſt is ſuppoſed to die for ſuch, who yet never were ſanctified by any means, whether more or leſſe they did enjoy.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Their temptatious either inward or outward are greatly different</hi>; Every god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man hath no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

No, but Chriſt in this pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, being God as well as man, and ſo cloathed with Omniſciency, did in this prayer <hi>know and attend to every particular believer, that ſhould in any age of the Church be born,</hi> as diſtinctly and nominally (as I may ſo ſay) as when he told <hi>Peter, I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not:</hi> So that here is a great difference between Chriſts prayer for the univerſall Church, and ours. We cannot name the particular believers, that ſhall be in every age, but Chriſt did repreſent in this prayer every individual man, and had as diſtinct knowledge of all believers, as of the Apoſtles whom he knew man by man.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, <hi>This muſt neceſſarily be ſo, becauſe though the execution and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of thoſe benefits we receive by Chriſts prayer, and his death be in time, yet the Decree and purpoſe was from all Eternity.</hi> Chriſt did not at this time of prayer, or the hour of death beginne to will good to them: No, that love to them was eternal, and of old: Inſomuch that we cannot ſay, There ever was a time, when God did not purpoſe theſe glorious things for them, and therefore it is, that the Scripture doth often call the godly to this conſideration, that his mercy and love to them was of old, even before they ever had a being, or the world either, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.4. <hi>He hath choſen us in him, before the foundations of the world</hi>; and that is remarkable, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. where this grace of God is ſaid <hi>to be given us in Jeſus Chriſt before the world began.</hi> It's ſaid to be actually given us before the world began, either becauſe God had decreed to do ſo, or elſe becauſe it is as certain, as if it had been done already: Oh then, what lively conſolations ſhould this breed in a believers breaſt, Gods gracious thoughts of mercy were of old to me, when I was many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of years from having any being, yet even then was I in Gods minde and love! No wonder if all eternity be not long enough to bleſs and praiſe God for this eternal purpoſe of his.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Yet in the third place, <hi>Though we are then choſen in Chriſt from Eternity, yet take heed of that abſurd Errour, which holds, Our ſins are pardoned, and our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons juſtified from Eternity.</hi> To ſay, That while a man is unconverted, wallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and tumbling in his luſts, that his ſinnes are pardoned, and that he is as well loved of God before his converſion, as after, is to contradict the whole courſe of Scripture; for though we be elected, and thus predeſtinated from Eternity, yet the <hi>Effects</hi> of this are not beſtowed upon us, till <hi>in time, and in ſuch a manner as God pleaſeth. Praedeſtinatio eſt amor Ordinativus,</hi> not <hi>colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivus,</hi> as the Schools ſay. It's <hi>immanent</hi> in God, not <hi>tranſient</hi> in us: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you ſee our Saviour ſuppoſeth ſuch to be believers, who ſhall be made partakers of his death; He doth not promiſcuouſly pray for all men, he doth not commend to Gods love every man or woman, but the belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver onely: So that we are to diſtinguiſh between the purpoſe of God, and the gracious effects thereof, otherwiſe we may as well ſay, we are glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified from Eternity.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, <hi>Hence, in that Chriſt doth thus determinately pray for every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual believer; It's a plain Argument that he is God, as well as man:</hi> For how could thoſe things be as preſent to him, which yet were many years to come, if he was not God, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.18. <hi>Known unto God are all his works, from the beginning of the world.</hi> Thus Chriſt being God as well as man, to him was known the ſtate and condition of every believer, not only before he was born, but before the world had a being: Therefore from hence it may be properly
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:65216:287"/>
gathered, that even to the humane nature of Chriſt was revealed the number of thoſe perſons, whoſe ſalvation he was to procure: So that Chriſt as man, as well as God, knew who they were that ſhould believe in him. It's true, Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſciency could not be communicated to the humane nature, as the Orthodox maintain againſt the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> neither was the knowledge of all things reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to it, but as the Sonne of man, he knew not the day of Judgement when it ſhould determinately be; and the neſcience of this was not any ſin in him, yet the revelation of this to his humane nature, <hi>viz.</hi> who they were that he ſhould die for, ſeemeth to be more neceſſary, even as Divines ſay, The humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Chriſt, ſhall by revelation from the Divine at the day of Judgement, know all the thoughts and ſecrets of mans heart, that ſo he may be the great Judge of the world in both his Natures, howſoever here is a clear argument, that Chriſt is God as well as man, and that his Godhead concurreth to the work of our Redemption.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Therefore fifthly, <hi>It is not to be thought impoſſible, that even all things that are to come ſhould be thus preſent to Chriſt, though it be to us.</hi> For our knowledge is meaſured by time, and there is not only a ſucceſſive order in the objects we know, but alſo in the acts of knowing: But the meaſure of Gods knowledge is by eternity, wherein all things do exiſt together: So that though in themſelves one object be after another, yet in reſpect of God, they are beheld with one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuitive act: As a man with one caſt of an eye from ſome high Tower doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold many paſſengers going by, one after another. It's true, we can no more comprehend how theſe things are all at once open and naked to God, then a <hi>Dwarf</hi> can reach the <hi>Pyramides,</hi> yet for all that we are to believe, what by reaſon we cannot comprehend. <hi>Quid enim magis contra rationem, quam ratione ſupra ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem tranſcendere,</hi> ſaid <hi>Bernard.</hi> It's enough for our comfort, that every be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, though yet unborn was in Chriſts purpoſe and intention, when he laid down his life, as if they had been exiſtent in the land of the living.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> In the ſixth place, <hi>By this intention of Chriſt in his prayer and death, it will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitably and immutably be brought about, that they ſhall in time be converted, they ſhall believe and be brought into communion and fellowſhip with Chriſt.</hi> For ſeeing as we have heard, Chriſt could not but be heard in what he prayed for, and the Father alwayes granted his Petition, therefore it cannot be but that all thoſe, who are given to Chriſt, ſhall one time or other be wrought upon by the Word. Thus it's ſaid, <hi>They believed</hi> (Act. 13.48.) <hi>as many as were ordained to eternal life</hi>; and the Apoſtles were to go and preach in ſuch places, <hi>becauſe God had much people there,</hi> Act. 18. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. the Apoſtle doth fully ſhew, That Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is the cauſe of all mercies vouchſafed in time, and thoſe who were not ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted they were hardened and given up to a ſpirit of ſlumber: Oh then the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable love of God to thoſe that are his, there ſhall not be one of them, but the Word of grace will finde them out! They that were not his people, ſhall be made his people, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. <hi>I have other ſheep</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>that are not of this fold,</hi> and thoſe he will bring home. Hence <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. we have that golden Chain, which all the Arminian ſubtilties can never diſſolve, <hi>Whom he hath predeſtinated, he hath called, and whom he hath called, he hath juſtified, and thoſe he hath juſtified, he hath glorified.</hi> To expound <hi>calling</hi> only of vocation to afflictions and to the croſs, and Juſtification only of the vindicating of their perſons and cauſe againſt the calumnies of the world, is too dilute and repugnant to the ſcope of the Apoſtle in that place; we may then abſolutely conclude of the converſion and believing of ſuch who belong to Chriſt, and that the Word preached will ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times or other be effectual upon them.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> In the laſt place, <hi>It's plain from hence, That Gods Election, and ſo Chriſts dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for us, is not conditional, or upon the ſuppoſition of our believing, but our belief is the true and genuine effect of Election, and Chriſts death.</hi> For whereas Chriſt
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:65216:287"/>
here prayeth for thoſe who ſhall believe; The Queſtion may be, <hi>Whether this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief be ſuppoſed as a Condition Antecedent to Election, and Chriſts death, or as an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Effect of both; ſo that Chriſt doth not only pray for believers, but alſo that they may be believers?</hi> There is a great Controverſie between <hi>Arminians</hi> and the <hi>Orthodox,</hi> for they ſay, God elected ſome ſuch perſons to eternal life in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and gave them to Chriſt as a Mediatour, but it was upon a ſuppoſition and fore-ſight, that they would believe and perſevere in that faith to the end. But the Orthodox do more conſonantly to the Scripture, and to the greater exaltation of Gods grace, and magnifying of Chriſt, affirm, That God by one ſingle act of the ſame time, did elect a man both to grace and glory, both to ſalvation and faith: So that God did not elect us, becauſe he foreſaw we would believe, but he did elect us to believe, as well as to ſalvation: So that faith is not a condition, but the effect and fruit of our Election. This is a neceſſary truth to be proved, and therefore the next day it is to be conſidered; for the preſent I take it for granted, That thoſe who ſhall believe, are ſuch, not who by their own power ſhall either believe or diſpoſe themſelves to it, but who by the grace of God ſhall be inabled thereunto: For the preſent, conſider the ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation of this love of God in Chriſt to us before we had a being. And</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>There is remarkable freeneſſe in it of grace, if poſitively and abſolutely conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered:</hi> For what could there be in us to move God to this mercy, when we could not think, or cry, or pray, or do any thing for our good, even then God ſet his love upon us? It was nothing in us, ſeeing we were in the womb of nothing.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>This freeneſs is aggravated, if comparatively conſidered, for it's the grace of God that makes ſome to believe, and leaveth others in their natural corruption.</hi> The Apoſtle conſidered this diſcriminating love of God to <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> Rom. 9. <hi>before they had done either good or evil:</hi> Oh then ſit and admire the depth of grace, the unſearchable riches of grace! for what art thou to ſo many learned and noble men in the world, to ſo many of thy own kindred and family that God hath paſt by, yet took compaſſion on thee? Didſt thou not lie equally in the ſame maſs of corruption and bondage to all ſin?</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>There is the Eternity of this love, it was before the beginning of the world:</hi> So that we cannot imagine any moment of time, wherein Gods thoughts were not upon thee.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, <hi>The unchangeableneſſe of this love, for the Councels of God and his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe are immutable, There is no change or ſhadow of change in him,</hi> and therefore if once loved, alwayes loved; he predeſtinated thee before the world, called thee out of the world, juſtifieth thee in the world, and will glorifie thee after the world.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> What infinite cauſe of praiſe and glory the people of God have? Well mayeſt thou call upon thy ſoul, and all within thee to praiſe God: Well may this be the burden of every <hi>Pſalm, For his mercy endureth for ever</hi>; yea, if thou hadſt the hearts of all men and Angels, this were not enough, neither can Eternity be long enough to glorifie God in this particular.</p>

            <head>SERMON CVI. Of both the Moving Cauſe and Effects of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and of Chriſts Prayer and Death; Againſt Arminians and others.</head>
            <epigraph>
               <bibl>JOH. 17.20.</bibl>
               <q>But for them alſo who ſhall beleeve in me through their Word.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>WE come to a Second Obſervation from the circumſtance of the <hi>fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture tenſe, Who ſhall beleeve in me</hi>; For (as was intimated) there may be a twofold ſence of theſe words.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That this future Faith is mentioned as an effect and fruit of being given to Chriſt, as alſo of Chriſts Prayer and Death for them, So that he doth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pray for them which ſhall beleeve, but alſo that they may beleeve, and in this ſenſe the Orthodox interpret it.</p>
            <p>Or 2. It may be interpreted as if Faith were here ſuppoſed as a condition on our part, antecedaneous both to Gods Election, and alſo Chriſts Interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and death, So that the ſence ſhould be, <hi>Theſe were given to Chriſt, and Chriſt he praied and died for them,</hi> becauſe it was foreſeen by God, that ſuch would beleeve upon the means of grace offered, and others not; In this ſence <hi>Meiſner</hi> a Lutheran urgeth it, and thus all <hi>Arminians</hi> and others muſt take it, who hold that we were Elected from a foreſight of our Faith and perſeverance therein.</p>
            <p>But that this cannot be the meaning of our Saviour is evident, becauſe the ground of Chriſts Prayer even in reſpect of thoſe who ſhall beleeve is, becauſe <hi>They were given to him by the Father,</hi> as appeareth <hi>verſ.</hi> 9. <hi>I pray not for the world but for them which thou haſt given me</hi>; Seeing therefore the Foundation of Chriſts Interceſſion is becauſe they were given by Election to Chriſt as a people to be ſaved through him, it's plain, that Chriſt praied not becauſe he foreſaw that they would beleeve, but becauſe they were Elected: It's true, the <hi>Arminians</hi> do in a moſt violent and ſtrange manner wreſt that phraſe of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing given to Chriſt; They underſtand it not of an action of the Father, but of the diſpoſition of the Subject; Hence it is they ſpeak ſo much of a <hi>probum in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genium,</hi> or a <hi>docilis indoles,</hi> as if it were ſome towardly diſpoſition in man, that fitted him for grace, but thus it would be rather who have given themſelves to Chriſt rather then that the Father had given them, and indeed this is ſuch a thorn in their ſides, that they cannot pull out, if by ſuch who ſhall beleeve were to be underſtood, thoſe that upon Gods foreſight were known to improve the means of Faith better then others, then all the difference from others, and the utmoſt reſolution of ſalvation, yea and Election would be unto a mans ſelf, when yet the Apoſtle doth expreſly ſtop ſuch mouths, <hi>What haſt thou that thou haſt not received?</hi> and who made thee to differ from another, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.7.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="537" facs="tcp:65216:288"/>The Text thus vindicated and explained, I gather this Obſervation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That Chriſt died not, and ſo we were not Elected becauſe we will beleeve,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Doct.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>but our beleef is the effect and fruit of Chriſts death and our Election</hi>: Our Faith is not a condition upon which our Election or Chriſts Death ſtands ſuſpended and indeterminate, but theſe do make us infallibly and effectually to beleeve in time: There are two common Opinions, The one holding, That God from all Eternity knew who would beleeve in time, and perſevere therein, and thereupon they were Elected, and Chriſt died for us; This way go <hi>Arminians</hi> and others; But 2. The Orthodox, they affirm that God did from all Eternity chooſe ſome out of the corrupt maſſe to Eternall glory, and for this end to give them Faith and holineſſe as the means thereunto; So that God did not elect us becauſe we did or would beleeve, but that we might beleeve, we beleeve becauſe we are Elected, not Elected becauſe we beleeve: This Doctrine is very uſeful becauſe it tends to humble and debaſe man, and wholly to exalt the grace of God, and therefore the more diligently to be confirmed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of late ſo greatly oppoſed:</p>
            <p>And before we bring Scripture-Arguments Let us Conſider ſome few things that will clear the ſtate of the Queſtion,</p>
            <p>As 1. There is a difference of thoſe who hold our Election, and ſo Chriſts Death to be upon the foreſight of ſomething in us, Some are more groſſe then others, For there are ſome that hold a man is Elected to glory <hi>upon the foreſight of his cooperation with the grace of God,</hi> as a true merit deſerving this Election, ſo that with them God did behold who by his free will would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the offer of grace, and for this as a meritorious cauſe they ſay God did Elect them unto Eternal Glory: But this is ſo highly injurious to the Grace of God, that though ſome Papiſts have maintained it, yet <hi>Bellarmine Valentia</hi> and other Jeſuites wholly diſclaim it at leaſt in words, making no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cauſe of predeſtination in reſpect of all the effects of it, but the ſole and meer good pleaſure of God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There are others, and they ſay the foreſight of the good or better uſe of our free-will then others <hi>is not a meritorious but a moving cauſe with God of our Election to Happineſſe</hi>: So that our Faith and Holineſſe though they were not a meriting Cauſe, yet were <hi>a moving Cauſe of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination,</hi> but this is alſo too groſly repugnant and contradictory to Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There are thoſe who refine it more ſubtlely, and that is, <hi>That God did foreſee who would beleeve and perſevere therein to Death, and ſuch are peremptorily choſen to Eternall Life, not that their Faith or Perſeverance is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny merit or moving Cauſe,</hi> but <hi>a Conditio ſine quâ non,</hi> without which God would not chooſe ſuch to happineſſe, ſo that (ſay they) it's not for any intrinſecall. Dignity or excellent worth in Faith, but becauſe of the many poſſible waies and means to Salvation; God appoints this way of beleeving rather then another, and thus the <hi>Arminians,</hi> Only they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge Holineſſe of Life, and Obedience to God to be thus a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition foreſeen as well as Faith, though they would ſeem utterly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. There are the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> and they indeed hold <hi>Faith fore-ſeen as a Condition in our Election</hi>; Only they ſay, <hi>It's not conſidered as a merit, or a Cauſe,</hi> no, nor as a work, but as an Inſtrument apprehending Chriſts merits, and therefore make Election to be by Faith, in the ſame ſence as we are juſtified by Faith; Hence they deny Holineſſe or Obedience to be a condition ingredient to Election, becauſe Chriſt is not laid hold upon by that as by Faith, although herein they contradict themſelves, becauſe they acknowledge not Faith ſingly as ſo, but Perſeverance in Faith to be
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:65216:289"/>
the Condition, and that muſt be neceſſarily looked upon as a work, not as an Inſtrument receiving Chriſt; But the Orthodox they affirm conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nantly to Scripture, and ſutably to the Glory of Gods Grace, <hi>That God did from all Eternity chooſe ſome men out of that corrupt maſſe in which all were, to Eternall Glory, and by the ſame Act did prepare and appoint all thoſe means which would effectually produce the ſame,</hi> So that this Election is the Originall and Fountain of all Spirituall mercies: becauſe Elected, Chriſt is appointed a Mediatour: Becauſe Elected, they are called and ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to beleeve in time, So that we deny there are two Elections, One to Glory, another to Grace; But God by the ſame ſingle Act doth will both, and therefore that there is not the ſame Reaſon of Election, and of Juſtification or Salvation, for theſe being Acts done in time do require Faith and Holineſſe, as antecedent, but Election being an Act of God from all Eternity cannot preſuppoſe any thing in us.</p>

                  <hi>Reaſons.</hi>
               </note>Now the Arguments to confirm us in this Truth they are theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, <hi>Becauſe the Scripture when it speaketh of this great and wonderfull work of Election, it doth ſtill reſolve all into the Counſell of his will,</hi> not into any thing fore ſeen in a man, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 8. <hi>Roman.</hi> 8. <hi>Roman.</hi> 9. and in many other places it is ſtill ſaid, <hi>He hath choſen us according to his Will, according to his purpoſe</hi>; Now if ſo be it were for any thing foreſeen in us, it would be rather according to the Counſell of our will, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our purpoſe: There cannot any rationall Anſwer be given unto this Argument, for according to the Adverſaries, God doth not Elect or chooſe any, untill he foreſee what every man will do, and if he do well and perſevere in this, then he is predeſtinated, but this doth at once daſh out all the Prepoſitions <hi>Prae,</hi> and turn them into <hi>Poſt,</hi> it is not <hi>prae</hi>-deſtination but <hi>poſt</hi>-deſtination, not <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; And this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſters a ſecond Argument.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, <hi>If ſo be that God did Elect and chooſe to Eternall Life becauſe he did fore-ſee our Faith, then the whole difference of one Beleever from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other would be attributed ſolely to mans Power</hi>; For to ſay, That this is Gods Decree, and his Appointment, that whoſoever ſhall beleeve ſhall be ſaved, doth not in the leaſt work upon any perſon, no more then that Decree of God, Whoſoever ſhall do this ſhall live, doth ſuppoſe any that will exactly keep the Law, ſo that no man in the world may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve for all this Decree; And thus when Chriſt prayed for thoſe who ſhall beleeve, he might have praied for a <hi>Non ens,</hi> a thing which might never have been; Therefore all the Queſtion is, How come ſome to beleeve and not others? How is it that of many who live under the ſame means of Grace, ſome are called effectually, and others grow more wicked and ſinnefull? Certainly the Scripture doth not give this unto mans Will, but to Gods free-grace and Love, as <hi>Matthew</hi> 13. <hi>To you it is given to know the Myſteries of the Kingdom of God, and unto others not</hi>: Thus Chriſt alſo <hi>Matthew</hi> 11. ſolemnly bleſſed and thanked God, That he had <hi>hid theſe things of Heaven from the wiſe and prudent ones of the world, and that he had revealed them unto Babes</hi>: And the Apoſtle expreſly, <hi>Who hath made thee to differ from another?</hi> 1 Corinth. 4.7. Therefore it's hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribly injurious unto the Grace and goodneſſe of God to ſay, That under the ſame Means of Grace I made my Self to beleeve, to repent rather than another: Certainly ſuch an Opinion as this is ſo groſſe and abſurd, that well may <hi>Arminianiſm</hi> be ſaid not only to be repugnant to many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Scripture, but even to the common ſence and experience of all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers; They have a witneſſe within their own breaſts, That they were
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:65216:289"/>
as unwilling, as froward, as oppoſite to the work of Grace as any; That it was God that made them of unwilling, willing: Even as there were many others that heard <hi>Paul,</hi> yet God is ſaid to open the heart of <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia</hi> rather then others.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, <hi>Faith and all holineſſe is the Effect and Fruit of our Election, and alſo of the Death of Chriſt, and therefore it cannot be an antecedent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi>; That is plain, that the ſame thing cannot be an Effect and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent of Election, and yet an antecedent Condition, at leaſt in the ſame Reſpects, for then it ſhould be conſidered as before and after at the ſame time, which is a plain Contradiction: Now that Faith is a Conſequent and an Effect of Election, and that we are Elected to Faith and Holineſſe, not becauſe we have Faith and Holineſſe, is clear by ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Texts of Scripture, as <hi>Act.</hi> 13.48. <hi>They beleeved as many as were ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to Eternall Life</hi>: Here is plainly ſet down the Effect and the Cauſe; <hi>They beleeved,</hi> and why? <hi>Becauſe ordained to Eternall Life</hi>; As for that Cavill to underſtand <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> intranſitively, as if it were no more than <hi>diſpoſiti,</hi> and ſo did imply ſome inherent probity that is not worth the anſwering; For how were the Gentiles diſpoſed to beleeve, who were ſaid to be dead in ſinnes, and plunged into all manner of impiety untill Grace had converted them: Beſides this diſpoſedneſſe to beleeve, whence doth it ariſe? Either from our ſelves, and ſo all Glory is due to us, or from the Grace of God; And if ſo, How cometh it to paſſe that ſome have it and not others but becauſe of Election? And it is further to be added, That it is not ſaid in the Text, <hi>They beleeved that were ordained</hi>; Or (as they ſay) diſpoſed to beleeve, but <hi>to Eternall Life,</hi> which doth neceſſarily ſuppoſe an Action of God, in whoſe power alone it is to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of Eternall Life: Thus alſo <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. There are very emphaticall Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions to ſhew that we are Elected <hi>to be holy and unblameable in the ſight and preſence of God</hi>; And whereas they would referre this to our glorious Eſtate in Heaven that cannot be, becauſe <hi>unblameable</hi> doth properly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to our being here upon the Earth: It is true, we will readily grant, That both Faith and Holineſſe they doe enter into the Decree of Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on taken terminatively, as it ends in Everlaſting Happineſſe: Therefore it is a meer Calumny to ſay, We hold ſuch an abſolute Election to Glory and Happineſſe as hath no reſpect to Chriſt or to Faith: For although we deny that Chriſt was the meritorious Cauſe of our Election, yet it's plain by Scripture we are choſen in him as the Head, and ſo the Cauſe of all the Benefits that come by Election; And God had reſpect unto Faith, He choſe Beleevers to Salvation, onely this Faith was not looked upon as an antecedent Condition in us, but as a qualification which God by Election doth work in the hearts of thoſe that ſhall be ſaved: We ſay, God hath Elected ſuch to Salvation whom in time he will by that Decree make Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers; For he that wils an end doth thereby will the means that tendeth thereunto, only we deny they were ſuppoſed Beleevers firſt, and then God E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected them.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, God doth not Elect upon the fore-ſight of Perſeverance in Faith, <hi>Becauſe the Scripture every where makes Election to be the Origina<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>cts in time, Election hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and <hi>it is not of him that willeth, or runneth, but of God that ſheweth mercy</hi>; Whereas <hi>Austin</hi> of old urged by the Adverſaries Opinion repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; We might as well ſay according to them, it is not of him that cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, but of him that willeth; And <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.

            <p>Fifthly, If the humane Nature of Chriſt was not choſen to the perſonall Union for any fore-ſeen merit, much leſſe may any meer man be Elected to Glory, becauſe of any ſuppoſed worth; This was an Argument urged of old by <hi>Auſtin,</hi> and is very ſtrong; By what Grace that particular man was made Chriſt, by that we are made Chriſtians; Now the Apoſtle ſaith expreſly that Chriſt 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 1.20. he was fore-ordained and appointed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Foundation of the world, and all will readily grant, that this was not for any fore-ſeen worth and Excellency in the Humane Nature of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Not to mention all that may be brought, If we are Elected upon Faith fore-ſeen, and Perſeverance therein, then none are Elected until they come to die, and then all thoſe places of Scripture which ſpeaks of our Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ſo as to praiſe God, to have Confidence in him, to triumph over all Afflictions, would all be in vain, for a man that is dead cannot perform theſe Duties.</p>

            <p>For the gracious diſpoſition, <hi>viz.</hi> of believing, I ſhall (God wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling) treat more generally of the Nature of it, <hi>verſ.</hi> 21. where it's again mentioned, and ſo ſhall paſſe over the <hi>Act,</hi> and come to the <hi>Object,</hi> that ſpecifieth it: And the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is emphatical; for it's obſerved by the learned, that no prophane Authors uſe that phraſe <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, it's pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to the Scripture: So that as the thing it ſelf, <hi>viz.</hi> recumbency and reſting upon Chriſt for ſalvation, is onely known in the Church of God, ſo is the phraſe.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not at this time examine that ordinary diſtinction of <hi>credere Deum, Deo,</hi> and <hi>in Deum,</hi> it will be more pertinent at <hi>verſ.</hi> 21. where the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of faith in it's latitude is to be examined. At this time, I am to conſider the reſtriction of it to it's principal and chief Object, and that is <hi>Chriſt:</hi> For there is a two fold object of Faith, the <hi>generall,</hi> and that is the whole truth of God revealed in the Scriptures, and the <hi>ſpecial,</hi> that is, the Lord Chriſt making an atonement for us, and as Faith doth reſpect this ſpecial object, ſo it juſtifieth, a mans faith doth not juſtifie him, as it believeth the threatnings or hiſtorical part of the Scripture, but as it receiveth Chriſt, and reſteth on him. It's true, the habit of juſtifying faith puts it ſelf forth into all thoſe general acts, as a man by his rational ſoul accompliſheth the acts of ſenſe, which are common to a beaſt, but that which doth ſpecifically conſtitute him as a man, is <hi>rationality</hi>; ſo juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying faith doth inable a man to believe every truth revealed in Gods Word, but that by which he is juſtified, is when he wholly depends upon Chriſt, and as was ſaid, This is emphatically expreſſed in Scripture, by <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>h which juſtifieth and ſaveth us, maketh us wholly to depend and rely upon Chriſt.</hi> So that it is with the believer in the matter of Juſtification, as it was with <hi>Peter,</hi> when ſinking into the ſea, he cried out to Chriſt, who took him by the hand, and leaning on him was ſaved. Thus the believer, he is even ſinking and dropping into hell, he crieth out, I am damning, I am damning, and then Chriſt putting his hand forth, faith taketh ſtrong hold of it, and ſo is ſupported: or as the <hi>Iſraelite</hi> ſtung with a Serpent, it was not the looking upon other objects, but only upon the Serpent, and it was looking or meer behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, not applying any medicinal things that did cure: So it is here: It's not the believing of every truth, but only on Chriſt that juſtifieth, and it is only believing, not repenting, not loving, though they be neceſſary graces in the perſons juſtified, but only believing, upon which we are juſtified. Seeing that this is the quinteſſence of all practical Divinity, and the life of faith is that which we are to be exerciſed in continually; and alſo there are many corrupt doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal opinions that oppoſe it.</p>
            <p>Let us the more diligently conſider the whole nature of faith, as it juſtifieth. And</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The ſeveral kinds of faith.</note>Firſt, <hi>You muſt know that Proteſtant Writers conſonantly to the Scripture make four kindes of Faith,</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Hiſtorical,</hi> which ſome call Dogmatical, whereby we do believe the truths of Scripture revealed therein, becauſe of Divine Authority, becauſe God ſaith ſo; for if it be only from cuſtom or education, or other humane ends, then it's not ſo much as a Divine, Hiſtorical faith, and this faith all Chriſtians are ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to have, though it's to be <hi>feared few have any more then a bare humane faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. There is a <hi>Temporary Faith,</hi> called ſo, becauſe it doth abide but for a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, it being not able to endure the force of perſecution, and this is a degree high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then the former, for that was only in the underſtanding, and ſo had no effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy upon the heart or affections at all, but this temporary faith is carried out with <hi>ſome affections,</hi> both to the perſon revealing, and the matter revealed, for <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. <hi>They received the Word with joy, who believed but for a ſeaſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. There is the <hi>Faith of Miracles,</hi> which was granted in the primitive times of the Church, for the confirmation of the Goſpel, and that ſometimes to thoſe who were not juſtified perſons, and this had for the object of it a peculiar and ſpecial promiſe for the doing ſuch or ſuch miraculous effects, and anſwerable to this, ſome learned Divines do acknowledge ſtill a ſpecial faith, whereby the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are ſometimes raiſed up for the effecting of a particular mercy, they ſtand in need of.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The object of faith.</note>Laſtly, There is this <hi>Juſtifying or ſaving Faith,</hi> which hath for it's <hi>proper ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject Chriſt crucified,</hi> and ſo by reſting upon him brings reconciliation with God, and peace in the conſcience. It's true, ſome diſtinguiſh between juſtifying faith, and ſaving, as if all that faith, which did juſtifie, did not alſo ſave, but that is built upon that dangerous foundation, as if there might be Apoſtaſie from the true faith.</p>
            <p>Now whether this diſtinction be exact, and in what ſenſe it is to be made good, I ſhall not here diſpute, but take it for a neceſſary truth.</p>
            <p>Secondly, When we ſay, <hi>That faith juſtifieth as it reſteth on Christ, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:65216:291"/>
him, we do not deny or exclude aſſent to all other divine truth, revealed in Gods word.</hi> Juſtifying faith doth neceſſarily ſuppoſe hiſtorical or dogmatical faith. So that although they be two diſtinct kinds of faith, yet in a juſtified perſon all thoſe acts of faith proceed from the ſame root and habit, that principle of faith where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by I am inabled to reſt on Chriſt, makes me alſo firmly to aſſent to every truth of Gods word, yea this dogmatical faith is the foundation of juſtifying, and did men exerciſe ſtronger acts of hiſtorical faith, it would much conduce to our ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying faith and ſtrengthen that, did we believe more firmly that Chriſt came to be a Mediatour, then this would quicken up to peculiar confidence in him. Therefore the devil hath temptations againſt both, ſometimes he aſſaulteth us in the matter to be believed, and ſometimes about our application of what we do believe: Therefore we are not to oppoſe theſe ſpecial acts of faith againſt the general.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>This phraſe of believing in Chriſt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">It's an act of the will as wel as the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</note> doth plainly denote <hi>a fiducial act of the will and heart, as well as the aſſent of the underſtanding.</hi> And this is greatly to be obſerved, that we are not to look upon believing, as a diſpoſition to aſſent to the things of God as true; but we do by believing incline the whole heart to truſt and reſt on Chriſt in whom we do believe. It's greatly diſputed, Whether this fiducial application or confidence be of the formal nature of faith, or an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and conſequent only of it; but I ſhall wave that at this time. It's plain, that to <hi>believe in,</hi> doth denote ſome cordial and fiducial motion of the ſoul to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, as it's center, and on that which gives us firm reſt; Hence faith is called, <hi>receiving of Chriſt</hi>; it's ſaid to be <hi>the eating of his fleſh, and drinking of his blood</hi>; It's called <hi>the imbracing of the promiſes</hi>; and oppoſite to this believing is <hi>fear,</hi> Luk. 8.50. and diffidence, and wavering: So that it's plain, faith hath a fiducial aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with it, therefore it's called <hi>believing with the whole heart,</hi> Act 8.37. The heart believeth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.9. as well as the underſtanding.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Hence it is alſo, <hi>That faith is made by ſome Divines, not a ſimple, but an aggregate or compounded habit, that it is not in one faculty ſeated, but in two,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The ſeat of faith.</note> 
               <hi>that it is both in the minde and the will.</hi> And howſoever ſome have argued againſt this, as being contrary to all Philoſophy, for one habit to be in two faculties, yet the moſt learned Schoolmen do confeſs it no abſurdity, for with ſome free-will is ſeated, partly in the underſtanding, and partly in the will; as alſo prudence a moral vertue is partly in the minde, and partly in the will; and all do confeſſe, That though to believe be an immediate act of the underſtanding, yet to this there is required <hi>pia affectio in voluntate</hi>; and indeed, ſeeing as the Apoſtle ſaith, there is a captivating of the underſtanding in it's carnal reaſons, when we do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that cannot be without ſome prevalent power upon the will: So that we are to look upon <hi>Faith as a compounded habit, which doth partly work upon the minde, by enlightning that, and partly upon the will, by enclining and ſtrengthning that.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly, <hi>The ground why juſtifying faith muſt needs comprehend both,</hi> is, <hi>Becauſe that in the promiſes of the Scripture, there is a two-fold object to move our faith; for every promiſe hath in it that which is true, and ſo it requireth aſſenting acts, and then it hath that which is good, and ſo it requireth fiducial and imbracing acts.</hi> Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der not then, if faith extend it ſelf to two diſtinct powers of the ſoul, ſeeing it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo reacheth to two diſtinct objects, truth being the object of the underſtanding, and good the object of the will. The Apoſtle comprehends both in that ſpeech, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15. <hi>This is a faithfull ſaying, and worthy of all acceptation; a faithfull ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> there is the truth to be believed, <hi>and worthy of all acceptation,</hi> there is the good to be imbraced. Therefore believing is not a bare ſpeculative aſſenting to the truth, but it is alſo a ſweet quieting and compoſing of the heart to receive the good promiſed: Hence it's called <hi>receiving,</hi> Joh. 1. and <hi>eating and drinking,</hi> Joh. 6. it's compared to the <hi>branches</hi> receiving moiſture from the <hi>vine,</hi> Joh. 15.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, <hi>As the Scripture expreſſeth faith, relating to the object believed, not to
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:65216:292"/>
the propoſition, ſo at other times it doth expreſſe the propoſition</hi>; Hence it hath oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> put to it, <hi>Doeſt thou believe that I am the Son of God, or that I am ſent from the Father?</hi> This is a propoſition to be believed; but you muſt know, that faith as it juſtifieth, is not properly in that we believe ſuch a propoſition to be true, <hi>viz.</hi> That Chriſt is God, or that he will give eternal life to ſuch as believe, but the <hi>ens incomplexum,</hi> that is, Chriſt himſelf in his Perſon and Offices, is the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of our juſtifying faith: Therefore Chriſt himſelf is ſaid <hi>to dwell in our hearts by faith,</hi> Eph. 3. Even as the woman is married to the perſon of her husband, and not to the articles of agreement upon marriage; and this is that which makes faith to be ſo powerfull and noble in it's efficacy, becauſe Chriſt is hereby recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the ſoul, who is the authour and fountain of all ſpiritual operations: So that as when the Sun ariſeth in our hemiſphere, it cannot but give light and heat; ſo alſo when the Sun of righteouſneſs ariſeth in our hearts, there is the Spirit of Chriſt alſo accompanying him in Sanctification and Mortification.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Theſe things are required to juſtifying faith</note>Seventhly, <hi>To juſtifying faith, there are theſe things required, ſome whereof are antecedent and concomitant, others eſſential and conſtitutive of it.</hi> As</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>There muſt be ſome explicite knowledge of Chriſt, and underſtanding of him in his Perſon and Offices.</hi> Whether knowledge be an act included in the eſſence of faith, or whether it be preparative and antecedent, is diſputed: Howſoever it's certain, None can believe that doth not know the thing he believeth: Henc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> it is that faith is ſo often in Scripture called knowledge. It's true indeed, faith hath not an evident comprehenſive knowledge, for then it would be <hi>ſcience,</hi> ſtrictly ſo called, but it hath a plain knowledge of the <hi>teſtimony</hi> or <hi>authority</hi> that revealeth it, and alſo ſome <hi>apprehenſive,</hi> though not <hi>comprehenſive knowledge</hi> of that we do believe: Hence <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>I know whom I have believed,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.13. And again, <hi>How ſhall they believe unleſſe they have heard?</hi> Rom. 10. And this diſcovers the ſad condition of thouſands, who ſay, they believe in Chriſt, and yet have no true knowledge about him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>There is required to this juſtifying faith, a firm and lively aſſent to the whole word of God.</hi> For unleſs this be laid as a foundation, there cannot be any build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon it: Inſomuch that we ſee the Scripture ſometimes attributing ſalvation to the belief, that Chriſt was <hi>able,</hi> and that God was <hi>powerfull,</hi> not that by that object they were juſtified, only that was the particular in which the doubt and difficulty did ſeem to be, ſo that it was not excluſive of that ſpecial act of faith, but incluſive of it; and indeed this is neceſſary to be known, that juſtifying faith doth carry a man out, even to Hiſtorical or Dogmatical matter reſpectively to Juſtification: So that when a juſtified perſon believeth any temporal promiſe, or the power of God, it doth not ſimply and ultimately believe them as ſuch, but as they repreſent God a Father in Chriſt, ſo that he believeth the power of God, as of a Father in Chriſt, and all the temporal promiſes are looked upon as <hi>Yea and Amen in Chriſt</hi>; ſo that this is to be obſerved by the believer. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing true in the Scripture, but juſtifying faith fetcheth filial arguments from it, and makes him ſenſible of that peace and reconciliation with God in Chriſt. And indeed to believe all the truths in Scripture, doth beget fear and horrour, unleſs this juſtifying faith qualifie it, <hi>The devils believe and tremble</hi>; ſo the meer dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiſt he believeth, but hath cauſe to tremble, for till every thing be brought to Chriſt, that as God reconciled all things in heaven and earth through him; ſo if thou reduce all things in the Scripture to Chriſt, even the threatning part to him, becauſe fulfilled by him, thou wilt have ſolid comfort. Thus as it's with man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is rational, all thoſe animal acts, which are common to him with beaſts, yet are reductively and participatively rational, ſo in the godly man, all thoſe general acts of faith are reduced to juſtifying, as the ſumme of all.</p>

Faith, that is the eaſing and repoſing of the troubled Spirit: It is diſputed whether Repentance go before Faith, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed there is an Evangelical Repentance whereby the heart is melted with grief for ſinne, becauſe God is ſo gracious a Father in Chriſt, and this muſt neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly follow Faith, but then there is a Legal ſorrow for ſinne ariſing from Gods juſt hatred againſt it, which breeds great trouble and confuſion in the ſoul be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it hath laid hold on Chriſt, and this precedeth Faith; Of this our Saviour ſpeaks, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.32. <hi>Ye repented not that ye might beleeve</hi>; And ſo <hi>Peters</hi> hearers, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. were <hi>pricked at the heart,</hi> before they were directed into Evangelicall Repentance and Faith; There is then a fence of our undone eſtate going before this juſtifying Faith, whereby a man findes himſelf utterly loſt, all his deſirable things periſh, ſinne that was once ſo beloved by him, is as <hi>Tamar</hi> to <hi>Amnon,</hi> hated more then ever he loved it; Now he would throw it out of doors, the ſight and memory of it is grievous to him, I preſſe not ſuch a meaſure or degree of ſorrow, it worketh ſo much in all that there is a diſplacency and abhorren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in ſinne, as that which is the cauſe of all miſery.</p>

May I not only touch the hem of his garment, but take him alſo in my arms?

Beleeve on Chriſt</hi>; So that now he doth with <hi>Simeon</hi> take Chriſt in his arms, He can now ſay, Lord, let whatever come I ſhall bear it pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently, now I have ſeen thy Salvation, as it was with the poor Criple that could not ſtir or move, when healed, he can take up his bed and walk, ſo the poor tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted ſinner that before lay trembling, afraid to pray, afraid to come to the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, can now ariſe and walk performing all duties with comfort and zeal: You muſt know that this reſting on Chriſt when thus humbled for ſin, is not an effect of mans power; It's not in mans ſtrength to make this Iron to ſwim, to walk thus upon the waters, when every thing within and without is againſt man and yet for all this to depend upon the Lord Chriſt; No, it muſt be a divine and ſupernatural power from above, and therefore the work of Gods grace in Faith juſtifying is as great, though not as wonderfull, as in miraculous Faith; when any were enabled by beleeving to remove Mountains; this was not by any grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter power of God then when a poor humbled ſinner, by reſting on Chriſt, doth remove thoſe mountains of ſins, and that great gulf which is between God and the ſoul, We may well call juſtifying faith miraculous faith; For is not this a miracle, and a wonder of wonders? That the ſoul thus in darkneſſe, and plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into the deeps, yet ſhould cleave unto Chriſt, and ſay, <hi>Though he kill me, yet I will truſt in him</hi>; Oh we ſee if there were nothing but mans power, and the troubled ſinner were left to himſelf, he would immediatly deſpair, as we ſee in <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Judas</hi>; Even as the ſtone naturally deſcends downwards when you take away the pillar it leaned upon, ſo when you take away all the carnal props and hopes of a ſinner, and his ſins do every way environ him, he preſently fals into the mouth of deſpair; It's therefore the great work of Gods grace to ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to beleeve, <hi>To you it's given to beleeve,</hi> Phil. 1.29. And ſome are ſaid to <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve through the grace of God,</hi> Act. 18.27. and faith is called the <hi>work of God,</hi> not only becauſe it's that ſpecial grace which he doth ſo eminently require, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is the immediate efficient of it; Know then that the mighty work of God goeth to make the ſoul reſt on Chriſt, it would of it ſelf deſpair a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times over, and fall into hell before it would come to Chriſt, and Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence confirms this in many ſad and tempted Chriſtians, who though they goe from Miniſter to Miniſter, and reade the good promiſes of the Goſpel, yet can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not beleeve till the Sprit of God enable them; Now God enableth the humbled Soul to believe two waies, <hi>directive</hi> and <hi>effective,</hi> by direction and inſtruction, and that in theſe particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. <hi>By informing him that when the Soul is truly humbled for ſin, that it is a duty to beleeve in Chriſt</hi>; That ſuch are threatned with damnation who ſhall refuſe to come unto Chriſt, and this is a bleſſed leſſon to learn, when the Soul ſhall be thus perſwaded, that if in this caſe I receive not Chriſt, I commit a worſe ſin then ever yet I was guilty of; What a madneſſe is it in me to damn my ſelf for fear I ſhould be damned? I fear my other ſins may deſtroy my Soul, and not fear my unbelief; This is the great crying ſin of all others, <hi>He that believeth not, the anger of God abideth on him,</hi> yea, he is ſaid to be condemned already, and <hi>to make God a lyar</hi>; Oh then how happy is that ſoul when the Spirit of God doth thus enlighten and perſwade thee! Once it was a Queſtion and a doubt to thee, Whether thou mightſt lay hold on Chriſt? Once thy thoughts were, That to beleeve though it might be matter of comfort and priviledge, yet it was not of

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> as much afraid not to lay hold on Chriſt as to commit any other ſin; Thou art as conſciencious in believing every promiſe, as in conforming to every command; Thou dareſt no longer liſten to doubts and fears, to Satans Temptations in this matter, then thou dareſt to the luſts and pleaſures of ſin.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. <hi>The Spirit of God doth inſtruct us in this, That thus to beleeve and reſt on Chriſt is to perform or to do that to which Juſtification is promiſed; He that believeth is paſſed from death to life,</hi> and ſtill Remiſſion of ſins is ſaid to be received by Faith, and we are <hi>juſtified by Faith,</hi> Rom. 5. So that when the Soul doth reſt on Chriſt he performeth that to which Chriſt with all his benefits are promiſed, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. <hi>God ſo loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoſoever beleeveth in him ſhould not periſh but have eternnl Life</hi>; So that the humbled ſinner having his eyes thus opened, he ſeeth it the greateſt madneſſe and folly that can be not to receive Chriſt, and to reſt on him; Why thus he argueth, I cannot he juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I cannot partake of Chriſt till I do believe, ſo that to believe is as neceſſary in an inſtrumental way, as Chriſt in a meritorious way; Shall the diſeaſed Patient queſtion whether he ſhall take that medicine which will certainly heal him? Shall the hungry man doubt whether he may receive that alms which will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve his Life? Thus the humbled ſinner is convinced, that as he muſt not mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his own body wilfully by refuſing to eat meat, ſo he muſt not his own ſoul by a wilful rejecting of the promiſe.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. <hi>The Spirit of God inſtructs him in this alſo, That by beleeving he doth not only bring comfort and ſalvation to his ſoul, but in a most eminent manner doth alſo glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie God</hi>; As <hi>Abraham</hi> by that remarkable act of Faith is ſaid to give <hi>Glory to God,</hi> Rom. 4.20. The tempted Soul is apt to think, Why ſhould I believe? this is but to ſeek my ſelf, This is becauſe I would have comfort whatever becometh of Gods Glory; Oh but ſaith the believer when thus awakened, if I could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form all the Commandments of God, if I could love God ſo as to give my body to be burnt for his Name, yet I could not glorifie God ſo much as by believing, for this acknowledgeth God in Chriſt, wherein God is more to be admired then in the creation and government of the world.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, <hi>He is enabled to ſee the folly and unprofitableneſſe of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief</hi>; If he go not to Chriſt, where can Salvation be had? he is ſure to be damned by keeping from Chriſt; Therefore with thoſe Lepers he is reſolved not to periſh, but to go to God, though he ſeem an Enemy to him.</p>
            <p>And then 2. God worketh faith in us <hi>effectively,</hi> as you heard, by ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the heart of a man fiducially to repoſe on Chriſt, if other graces as love and patience do not grow of themſelves in mans heart, much leſſe doth Faith which is ſo ſupernatural every way.</p>

It's <hi>his</hi> faith ſubjectively, though Gods effectively. This word then <hi>receiving</hi> doth carry every man hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled Evangelically, wholly out of himſelf; and as was ſaid to the woman look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the Sepulchre, <hi>Why look you for him, he is not here, he is riſen?</hi> So it may be ſaid, Why art thou ſearching and digging into thine own heart? Thy works or graces, theſe are not the object of faith; It's above thee; It's with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thee, though by faith applied to thee: Even as the poor cripple that deſired to be healed, looked upon Chriſt, expecting help from him, he knew he had nothing in himſelf; or as the indigent beggar looks without him, and ſtretcheth out his hand to receive food or money: So is it with the humbled ſinner: Oh then be directed here, why doth God make thy own heart, thy own wayes ſo bitter to thee? Is it not becauſe thou ſhouldſt ſeek out for a Chriſt, and look for a righteouſneſſe without thee?</p>

God, or doth for God, but what he receiveth from him. This is a fundamental principle to be grounded in, it's a mercy of mercies to be directed in the agonies of thy ſoul to the right way of believing, to know the way to this City of refuge; If a manſlayer purſued by the avenger, had not known the way to the City of refuge, what danger had he been in? It's like the childe not coming the right way in it's birth; now naturally we all think by doing to partake of Chriſt, not receiving, which made the Apoſtle ſo induſtriouſly aſſert this, <hi>That it's not to him that worketh, but to him that believeth, that grace is vouchſafed:</hi> So then be inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in this, Is thy heart groaning under ſin, all thy deſires and inclinations are to Chriſt?

               <note place="margin">5. And why faith and no other grace doth ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie.</note>And hence laſtly, we ſee, <hi>Why faith and no other grace doth thus juſtifie, becauſe this alone doth receive.</hi> Other graces are active, this is receptive: Not that faith is ſeparated from other graces, they are exiſtent together, though they retain their diſtinct properties, He that believeth on Chriſt is cleanſed and ſanctified, he loveth God, and is patient in tribulation, but yet not by this is he juſtified: As the Sun-beams have heat as well as light, but it ſhineth by the light only, not the heat, ſo the earth hath drineſs as well as gravity, but it fals downward, not becauſe dry, but becauſe heavy.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">II. This recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving is not a bare receiving, but an imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing alſo.</note>Secondly, <hi>This receiving is not a bare receiving, but ſuch as is with imbrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi> As <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.2. <hi>Theſe imbraced the promiſes</hi>; Even as <hi>Simeon</hi> took Chriſt with joy in his arms: So that there is great delight and cordial joy in laying hold on Chriſt: Even as the Church ſaid after ſhe had loſt her Beloved, yet find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him at laſt, ſhe would lay hold on him, and not let him go, as <hi>Ruth</hi> to <hi>Naomi,</hi> thus ſhe cleaveth to Chriſt: So that as a man receiveth with deareſt imbracements ſome choice and precious friend he longed to ſee: Thus it is with the humbled ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: Oh this is the beloved of many thouſands, whom my ſoul hath long prayed for, long ſought for? What have I found thee, Oh thou chiefeſt of many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands? Hence it is that Chriſt compareth himſelf to a <hi>Bridegroom,</hi> and <hi>Huſband,</hi> and his Church to a <hi>wife,</hi> to ſhew what real affections are in the heart of an humbled ſinner, for to lay hold on him: Hence it's called, <hi>Believing with the whole heart, and with joy unſpeakable,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.8. There was great feaſting and joy for the finding of a loſt ſon: But oh the unſpeakable joy, for diſcovering a Chriſt, that
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:65216:295"/>
we thought was for ever loſt, as to us! What meltings? what raviſhments are there at the meeting of him? Oh how often, ſaith the humbled ſoul, did I think, I ſhould never finde thee? How many times did I conclude, that I ſhould periſh in my luſts and fears? but Chriſt at laſt appeareth, as he did to thoſe women af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his death, who thought there was no hope.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>In this act of faith, there is contained reſting, relying, or fiducial re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of the ſoul upon Christ.</hi> You heard the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, did enforce this,<note place="margin">III. In this act of faith there is a fiducial repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the ſoul upon Chriſt.</note> ſo that the ſoul before it believeth is to be conceived as a ſtone falling downwards, which cannot ſtay till it meet with its center, and then it enclineth no further. In the Old Teſtament it's called, <hi>truſting in the Lord,</hi> which in other ſynonymous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions is ſometimes called <hi>ſtaying</hi> and <hi>leaning,</hi> and ſo is a metaphor taken from thoſe, who have ſome great and heavy burden upon their back, and thereby are cruſhed to the ground, unleſs they have ſomething to reſt upon. Thus it is with the afflicted penitent, he cryeth out, I finde ſuch a load of ſins, that my back would break, and heart would break, yea every thing would fail within me, had not I Chriſt to throw my ſelf upon: hence Chriſt is called the <hi>Foundation ſtone,</hi> becauſe all the building is eſtabliſhed upon that. Now that which in the Old Teſtament is called <hi>truſting in God,</hi> in the New is called <hi>believing. Illyricus</hi> thinketh this is the reaſon of the different expreſſion, becauſe the God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was <hi>known</hi> to the Jews, therefore there was required only a <hi>fiducial adheſion</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him; but in the New Teſtament, Chriſt as Mediator was not known, therefore another word is uſed, <hi>viz.</hi> to <hi>believe,</hi> which comprehends both an aſſenting knowledge, and alſo a fiducial application: So then by this act of beleeving, the ſoul which was ready to ſink under it's burden, doth lean upon Chriſt, and as a drowning man doth catch hold on the next branch to ſave him, ſo doth a humbled ſinner finding himſelf even falling into hell, catch hold on Chriſt, and therefore it's called <hi>laying hold on him</hi>·</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>In this act of believing,</hi>
               <note place="margin">IV. An applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt.</note> 
               <hi>there is an appropriation or application of Chriſt to be my Chriſt.</hi> That whereas the promiſe runneth in the general, <hi>Whoſoever ſhall believe, to him Chriſt is a Saviour.</hi> This juſtifying faith doth in particular reſt on Chriſt, as a Saviour to him. Thus <hi>Paul,</hi> Gal. 2. <hi>Who loved me, and gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for me</hi>; and <hi>Thomas, My God, my Lord,</hi> Joh 20. So that as when any threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is denounced againſt a ſinner, the true convert will apply it to himſelf, when guilty of ſuch a ſin, I am the ſinner this threatning meaneth: So Chriſt being offered as a Saviour to every humbled ſinner, from this general he concludeth his particular. Thus <hi>Paul, Chriſt came to ſave ſinners, of whom I am chief.</hi> Hence it is that our Divines againſt Papiſts do well maintain, That the object of juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faith, is the ſpecial mercy of God. It's not enough to believe that Chriſt is a Saviour, but to reſt on him to be my Saviour. Hence faith is called <hi>eating</hi> and <hi>drinking,</hi> Joh. 6. which is more then the meer ſeeing meat upon the Table, only when we ſay, ſpecial mercy is the object of juſtifying faith, it's not meant <hi>ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedenter,</hi> but <hi>conſequenter</hi>; Not as if we were to look for a ſpecial or particular promiſe made either to <hi>Thomas</hi> or <hi>Peter,</hi> as ſometimes Chriſt did to thoſe who were then alive, as when he ſpoke to that woman, <hi>Be of good comfort thy ſins are forgiven thee</hi>; here was a ſpecial promiſe to her in particular, but it's not ſo now the promiſe is general, but it's made ſpecial by beleeving; and indeed without this ſpecial applying act, our faith brings no peace, no comfort, no more then for a <hi>Lazarus</hi> to hear there was plentifull food in <hi>Dives</hi> his houſe,<note place="margin">V. This recum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent act of faith may not only thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Chriſt, but we may be aſſured that Chriſt is ours.</note> but he had not ſo much as the crums thereof. Thus you ſee how comprehenſive, this act of beleeving is.</p>
            <p>In the next place, <hi>This recumbent act of Faith may not only thus receive Chriſt, but we may alſo be aſſured and know that we do believe, and that Christ is ours.</hi> Indeed former Divines from an oppoſition to Popery, which teacheth doubting in our Juſtification and uncertainty, did define juſtifying faith, to be a full perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:65216:296"/>
of the heart, whereby we beleeve our ſins are pardoned, and that Chriſt died for us, but to beleeve that Chriſt is mine, or that I am juſtified, cannot be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying faith, but it ſuppoſeth it, for Chriſt muſt be mine before I know he is mine, <hi>The object muſt be before the act:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Faith hath two acts, a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flex.</note> Therefore faith hath two acts, a <hi>Direct Act,</hi> whereby it layeth hold on Chriſt, and a <hi>Reflex Act,</hi> whereby I know that I do lay hold on him, or that I am ſuch an one to whom the promiſes do belong. Now this beleeving on Chriſt, which juſtifieth is in the former act, out of the ſenſe of my ſins and deep unworthineſs to lay hold on Chriſt. The latter which we call <hi>Aſſurance,</hi> Though the people of God may and ought to attain unto, yet is not to be confounded with the former; nay it may be, and is often ſeparated from it; and this is much to be heeded by practical Chriſtians, you would have aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance firſt, and then you would beleeve in Chriſt, you would know whether your graces are true, whether you are ſo and ſo qualified, and then you would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve: This is, as if a woman would be aſſured ſuch a man were her husband, and then ſhe would marry him, whereas it is marriage makes the husband: It's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving makes Chriſt thine, and when he is thine, then thou mayeſt be aſſured he is thine. The cripple, and the woman, labouring under a bloody iſſue, felt themſelves whole after Chriſt had healed them, they could not before: So when faith hath made Chriſt thine, that thou canſt ſay with <hi>Thomas, My God, my Lord,</hi> then you may come to be aſſured, he is thine. Chriſt had not that ſenſe of Gods favour, when yet he had that fiducial confidence, crying out, <hi>My God, my God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The promiſe is made to him that beleeveth,</hi> not to him <hi>that knoweth he doth beleeve:</hi> It's not ſaid, If you have aſſurance, but if <hi>you beleeve you ſhall be ſaved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Though faith doth thus repoſe it ſelf fiducially upon Chriſt, yet you must know this is not done without oppoſition of unbelief and diffidence.</hi> 1 Joh. 3.19. The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>We aſſure our hearts, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, perſwade</hi>; This implyeth, that the heart of a man is full of objections, and hath many cavils: There is much ado ere the heart be perſwaded to reſt on Chriſt only, many Lions and mountains are in the way. That man ſpake the ſenſe of all beleevers, who prayed, <hi>Lord, I beleeve, help my unbelief,</hi> Mark 9.24. Oh how often is thy heart ready to be caſt down, and to have no hope! You may ſee theſe ebbings and flowings in <hi>Davids</hi> heart, faith and diffidence were like two twins ſtrugling in the womb; do not therefore expect ſuch a quiet reſting upon Chriſt, as ſhall have no oppoſition: No, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times thy heart may even rage with unbelief, like that poor demoniack, the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſt ſpeaks of, <hi>Mar.</hi> 5.4. that tore chains aſunder, and no man could tame him; Such an unruly thing may thy heart be. Now there are two great oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites to this recumbency, <hi>viz.</hi> The terrible things of thy heart, the guilt of ſin, the temptations of Satan, the ſad fears that moleſt thee, and then the ſweet plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing things of thy ſoul, which are ſelf-righteouſneſs, truſting in thy own heart, in thy own works; Oh this ſelf-fulneſſe, this mountain muſt be levelled, as well as this valley be exalted, elſe the way is not prepared for Chriſt!</p>

            <p>I ſhall now conclude this part which containeth the Qualification of the ſubject of Chriſts Praier, <hi>That beleeve in Chriſt</hi>; And whereas Faith hath a twofold Object, either <hi>general,</hi> of which <hi>v.</hi> 21. or <hi>ſpecial</hi>; This laſt is meant here, of which much hath been ſaid to clear the nature of it; I ſhall end at this time: And 1. I ſhall prove, <hi>that it's the duty of an humbled ſinner to have ſuch a fiducial recumbency on Chriſt, and that for the pardon of his ſins in particular</hi>; It's not enough to believe that Chriſt will ſave ſinners that repent and convert unto him, but they are to appropriate him to their own particular: To ſay with <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas, My Lord, My God</hi>: Now that Faith is ſuch a particular application of Chriſt, (whatſoever Papiſts and others gainſay) may appear from theſe Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments amongſt others.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>From the names and Titles that beleeving in Chriſt hath,</hi> which do evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly denote more then a meer intellectual aſſent unto the promiſes, as true; They imply ſome <hi>cordial motions of the ſoul</hi>; The Names are theſe <gap reason="foreign">

This is alſo emphatical, ſome make the word to be from the Sails of Ships when filled with the Winde, which carry the Ship away ſpeedily; Thus the heart of man that lay groveled, and could not move, when beleeving is mightily carried on in all duties; It is called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

So this Faith in Chriſt doth as it were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate the Promiſes, and tranſubſtantiate them into the believer; Another word is <gap reason="foreign">

Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence or boldneſſe is made an effect of faith, but confidence could not be an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of faith if faith had not this in its nature; As the Soul could not produce rational acts if it were not eſſentially rational, ſo neither could faith put a man upon fiducial acts, if it ſelf were not fiducial; Again this believing is called <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, to <hi>be bold on a man:</hi> By theſe Titles then which the Scripture giveth, Faith in Chriſt we ſee what a powerful operation it hath upon the heart, What a Faith of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual miracles (as I may ſay) juſtifying Faith is, and therefore know that thy
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:65216:297"/>
doubts, fears, dejections, and tormenting diſtractions are oppoſite to believing, as darkneſſe is to light, if God do above all graces thus approve faith, then he doth above all ſins abhor this dejecting unbelief.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That ſuch a ſpecial faith is required, appeareth, in that the Scripture limits this faith unto Chriſt as the peculiar and proper object</hi>; Hence the Evangeliſt <hi>John</hi> cals it ſo often <hi>believing in him</hi> that brings Eternal Life, and it's <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>By Faith in his bloud</hi> that we are purged and have pardon of ſinne, and generally when it ſpeaks of faith as juſtifying, it relateth to Chriſt as the Object of it; Not but that it believeth other Truths, only in believing of this we are juſtified, as the <hi>Iſraelite</hi> might look upon other Objects, but beholding of the brazen Serpent only made him whole; yea, as we told you, when the believing of other things is reduced to juſtifying Faith, all other Truths are ſweetned and qualified by that, as if a man had the Philoſophers ſtone, it would turn all other materials into Gold.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That Faith muſt be in a ſpecial manner fiducial and applying, <hi>appeareth in the effects that commonly follow it</hi>; For to this believing is attributed peace and unſpeakable joy, yea, a triumphing over all oppoſitions and difficulties, a boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and <hi>glorying in tribulation</hi>; Now this could never be without a particular intereſt in Chriſt, for what peace and joy doth it bring to hear, that Chriſt in the general came to ſave ſinners; Do not thouſands go to hell for all that? It's therefore neceſſary to true ſolid peace, that he become my Chriſt and my Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our; Hence it is, that believing is the uniting of the ſoul to Chriſt as an husband which is an appropriate Intereſt, as the Church expreſſed it, <hi>I am my Well-belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veds, and my well-beloved is mine,</hi> Cant. 2.16. And hence alſo are thoſe compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of an <hi>head</hi> and a <hi>body,</hi> of a <hi>Vine</hi> and <hi>branches,</hi> all which argue, that the good we have by Chriſt comes becauſe of our intimate union with him, So that if we do reſpect thoſe glorious effects which uſually accompany believing, they will neceſſarily ſuppoſe a <hi>fiducial appropriation of Chriſt in a ſpecial manner.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>This ſpecial faith is ſeen by the oppoſites and contrarieties unto it,</hi> for he that doth not believe is ſaid <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Luk</hi> 12.29. to be <hi>carried up and down as a</hi> meteor that hath no fixed place; Thus while the ſoul is not fixed on Chriſt it's like a reed toſſed up and down with every winde, as one in a journey, and at a ſtand, ſeeing two waies, and not knowing which way to go, or as a man that is uncertain between two arguments, like the ballance with equal weights, that doth not incline to one ſide more then another; Theſe diſpoſitions of the Soul oppoſe faith, and it's a reſting and a determining of the ſoul upon Chriſt.</p>
            <p>And Laſtly, <hi>Diffidence and fear, theſe are made contrary to Faith, Fear not, but beleeve,</hi> Luk. 8.50. ſaid Chriſt to his Diſciples, which ſuppoſeth that faith hath boldneſſe and confidence in it; We then may judge of the nature of faith, by the oppoſite ſinfulneſs to it, and when we ſee fears, wandrings, uncertain toſſings up and down of the ſoul, in no waies ſtable and fixed, then we may conclude that faith it ſelf is a powerful, compoſing, and firm fixing of the ſoul upon the Lord Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That faith is thus in a ſpecial manner applying Chriſt appeareth alſo, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe otherwiſe it would be little better then the faith of devils,</hi> and of ſuch who have only a bare <hi>dogmaticall aſſent,</hi> for the devils made a Confeſſion of faith, <hi>That Chriſt was the Son of the living God,</hi> and therefore are ſaid to believe, yet they <hi>tremble,</hi> and are in unſpeakable horrour becauſe they know he is not a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour to them, and thus many believe, that Chriſt is the Meſſias, but becauſe there is no fiducial adheſion and appropriation of him, therefore he is not ſo to them; Even as many ſaw Chriſt, yet if they did not in particular apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to him, they were not healed of their diſeaſes; The hungry man may ſtarve though he ſee a Table furniſhed with plentiful food, if he do not put into his own mouth; It's particular Intereſt that enricheth, that ſaveth, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:65216:297"/>
it's ſaid, <hi>The Juſt ſhall live by his faith,</hi> Hab. 2.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, This truth may appear, <hi>From the abſurdity of that Poſition, to ſay, faith juſtifieth as it believeth the Word of God in general only,</hi> or any Truth aſſerted in general, for then my Faith would juſtifie me as well in believing, <hi>Judas</hi> hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf, as that Chriſt was crucified for me; Or that <hi>Paul</hi> had a Cloak and Parchments, as in the bloud of Chriſt; Certainly forgiveneſſe of ſinne is attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to Chriſt only, and ſeeing (as you heard) the object of faith juſtifying is <hi>bonum</hi> as well as <hi>verum</hi>; That which is beloved muſt have the chiefeſt good in it, as well as Truth, and this may ſuffice to inſtruct you in this main Point, that a Chriſtian humbled for ſin is not to reſt or to be ſatisfied in this, that Chriſt in generall came to ſave ſinners, or that he is able to ſave thee though an hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous offender, but to apply him for thy own particular; that thou maiſt ſay of all the glory of the Goſpel, which the devil did falſly of the glory of the world, <hi>All this is mine.</hi>

            </epigraph>
            <p>I Shall now finiſh this fruitfull Text. The laſt thing conſiderable in it, is the inſtrumental cauſe of faith, and that is the Apoſtles Miniſtry. This faith is wrought by their <hi>word.</hi> To open this, Conſider</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the word which begets faith, is called Gods word, <hi>verſ.</hi> 6. and here the Apoſtles word in a different ſenſe: It's Gods word originally and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently, becauſe revealed by him: It's the Apoſtles word miniſterially, becauſe they are the Embaſſadours to publiſh it. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> cals it <hi>his Goſpel,</hi> as in other places, it's the <hi>Goſpel of God,</hi> becauſe the Miniſters of God are <hi>Stewards,</hi> to whom is concredited the diſpenſation of the Word, therefore it is called <hi>their word.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Whereas Chriſt prayeth for all <hi>that ſhall believe</hi> even to the end of the world, and yet they are ſaid to believe by the Apoſtles word, when yet thouſands and thouſands have believed ſince the Apoſtles death and departure; Its neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, that by the Apoſtles we do not underſtand only their perſons, but the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Miniſtry unto them, which is to be perpetual in the Church, all that now or hereafter ſhall beleeve, though by the preſent Miniſters that lived many hundred years after the Apoſtles, yet may be ſaid to obtain faith by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles word, becauſe they ſit in the Apoſtles chair, they deliver the Doctrin, which they delivered, and ſucceed the Apoſtles, though not in perſonal and extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries, yet in ordinaries, in which ſenſe Chriſt promiſeth <hi>to be with them to the end of the world.</hi> The words thus explained, we may obſerve,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That God hath appointed a perpetual Miniſtry,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Obſerv.</hi> God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed a perpetual Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry to the end of the world.</note> 
               <hi>even to continue as long as there ſhall be a Church in the world.</hi> All that ſhall beleeve are brought thereunto by the Apoſtles word; now they being long ſince dead, it neceſſarily followeth, either that none can now beleeve, or elſe that there is a Miniſtry to be perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſucceeding them for this ſpiritual effect. That the Miniſtry and Word preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is the means of faith, appeareth evidently, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.17. <hi>Faith comes by hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and hearing by the word of God</hi>; yea <hi>verſ.</hi> 14. there is a chain of faith, and hearing, and preaching inviolably put together. We may bring a ſecond wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to confirm this, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Who is Paul, or Apollo, but Miniſters by whom you beleeve?</hi> Where you ſee to be inſtruments of faith is not only limited to <hi>Paul</hi> the Apoſtle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but is extended to other ordinary Officers in the Church, even all that water as well as plant. The Apoſtles planted, the ordinary Miniſters they water.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not at this time prove a diſtinct calling of Miniſters from people, that hath been done already. I ſhall only ſhew the perpetual uſefulneſs and neceſſity of a Miniſtry, for ſpiritual ends, as long as there will be a Church upon the earth; and the rather, becauſe <hi>Socinians</hi> and <hi>Seekers,</hi> though they grant, There was
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:65216:299"/>
once an extraordinary Miniſtry in the planting of the Church, yet they ſay, it was only temporal for a ſeaſon, even as miracles were, and that where the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is made common, there needeth no Miniſtry. Therefore to inform herein, conſider theſe Propoſitions,</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>That God hath appointed a Miniſtry in his Church, not from neceſſity, but a voluntary liberty condeſcending herein to our capacity.</hi> God did once govern his Church, as in the Patriarchs time, by immediate revelations and apparitions, and thus he could ſtill do, if he pleaſed: It's not therefore from neceſſity, but meer bounty, that he hath appointed ſuch a way of ſpiritualizing people. God doth not need the parts, or gifts, or piety of any men in the world; and certainly, if God hath appointed ſecond cauſes in nature, which work from a neceſſary prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple within, not neceſſarily, but freely, much leſſe did he in theſe things which are of a ſupernatural conſtitution.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It's to be affirmed, <hi>That in the firſt plantation of Chriſts Church, there were ſome things extraordinary, but that doth not inferre every thing thus ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed was extraordinary.</hi> The Office of the Apoſtles, who had a Commiſſion to go over the world, and had an univerſal Authority, being furniſhed to that end with infallible aſſiſtance, was extraordinary. Chriſt ſeedeth his Church ſpiritually, as he did once the bodies of men miraculouſly, firſt, he took bread himſelf, then he gave bread to his Diſciples, and they gave it to the people. Thus Chriſt he preached the word of life, and then he commanded the Apoſtles to preach, who inſtituted others in their room. The Office then of Apoſtles and Prophets, with the gift of miracles, were extraordinary in the firſt conſtituting of the Church; but then ordinary Officers were afterwards required; As with the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> while in the wilderneſs, God made miraculous proviſion for them, but when once ſetled in <hi>Canaan,</hi> then their Manna and other miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous proviſion failed them.</p>

                  <hi>Queſt.</hi>
               </note>And if you ſay, <hi>How ſhall we know, what is an extraordinary Office, and what is an ordinary Office, ſeeing the Apoſtle,</hi> Eph. 4.11, 12. <hi>reckons them up altogether?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi>
               </note>I anſwer, It's true, the Apoſtle there mentioneth extraordinary and ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Officers, becauſe he is to ſpeak of the whole fruit of Chriſts Aſcenſion to his Church, and ſo becauſe Apoſtles were a great and principal part of Chriſts gift to his Church, and the influence of their labours upon the Church to the end of the world, and therefore they are called the <hi>foundation,</hi> Rev. 21.14. Hence they are mentioned as well as the ordinary; only the difference between theſe two may appear in the qualifications of either, for to an Apoſtle was required gifts of miracles, an univerſal Commiſſion and Authority, infallibility of aſſiſtance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but to the ordinary Elders there is no ſuch thing required, but what may be in an ordinary manner attained unto.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, When we ſay, <hi>A Miniſtry is appointed for ſpiritual ends, it's good to know in particular what they are.</hi> And</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>You ſee it's in the Text, To work Faith:</hi> And therefore faith is ſaid to come by hearing. The ear that is the organ of learning and knowledge, as alſo of faith. It's obſerved by a learned man, That though we reade of godly perſons, that could not ſee or ſpeak, yet of none that could not hear, becauſe that was the inſtrument of faith, yet this is not ſo to be urged, as if a godly man might not be made deaf, only it's a ſad affliction, becauſe by hearing faith is begotten and increaſed: What enemies then are ſuch to their ſouls, who care not for hearing, who give over hearing, come now and then it may be for ſinful ends, whereas by hearing the Word preached God hath appointed to give thee faith? Art thou not then ſuch an atheiſtical or prophane man, becauſe thou doeſt no more regard this hearing of Gods word preached? <hi>Be ſwift to hear,</hi> ſaid the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>James</hi> 1.19.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The Miniſtry is appointed for the converſion and regeneration of men, who na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
<pb n="559" facs="tcp:65216:299"/>
are dead in ſinne, and averſe to God.</hi> It was a ſubject the Prophets often preached upon, <hi>to return every one from his evil way to God</hi>; and <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> yea Chriſt himſelf alſo preached <hi>repentance</hi> as well as <hi>faith.</hi> Hence <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. God is ſaid, <hi>Of his own will to beget us by his Word</hi>; and ſo its called <hi>the waſhing of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation through the word,</hi> Tit. 3.5. That as the Spirit of God at firſt by moving on the waters, prepared and produced living creatures; Thus God by the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances cals thoſe who are like <hi>Lazarus</hi> dead in their ſins, to come out of the grave and live. There is a reſurrection of ſouls by the Prophets, <hi>when they lift up their voice like a trumpet,</hi> as well as there will be of bodies, by the trump of an Archangel; and indeed this is the proper effect of the Miniſtry: No moral Philoſophy hath attained to the inward change of mens hearts: As <hi>Eliah,</hi> when he threw his mantle on <hi>Eliſha,</hi> he left his Oxen and followed him: Thus when God by the Word preached doth lay hold on the heart of a man, he is a new creature, minde new, heart new, affections new, all is made new. Thus while <hi>Peter</hi> was preaching, there were three thouſand converted; So that to take the preaching of the Word away, is worſe then to take the Sun out of the heavens, that is but an inſtrument of heat and life bodily, this ſpiritually.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>The Ministry is for edification,</hi> as Eph. 4.14. <hi>For the perfecting of the Saints, and till we come to a full ſtature in Chriſt:</hi> So that the Miniſtry and Ordinances ſhall not be aboliſhed, till we come into heaven, the Sacrament is <hi>till he come,</hi> and he will be with the Miniſters till the end of the world; and certainly the godly man findes much need of a Miniſtry to quicken, comfort, and direct his ſoul, craveth and calleth for this, as much as his body doth for food and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: So that thoſe who argue againſt a Miniſtry demonſtrate, they finde no experimental benefit of it upon their own ſouls.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>God hath appointed it to propagate and defend the truth, to confute and put all errours and hereſies to ſilence.</hi> Therefore it's a qualification required in the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, <hi>That he be able to convince gain-ſayers,</hi> Tit. 1.9. You ſee the Apoſtle in ſome of his Epiſtles is not only practical, but didactical, and therein confuting thoſe errours that moleſted the truth, even in her Infancy; for this end they are called <hi>Guides</hi> and <hi>Salt</hi>; yea they are <hi>Shepherds</hi> to keep off the wolves that would ſubtilly devour the ſheep; We are to watch againſt prophaneneſs, and alſo againſt errours. The Apoſtle uſeth that phraſe <hi>of a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump,</hi> both in matter of corrupt manners, as alſo corrupt Doctrine, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. and therefore would have the Churches of God purged from both.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, <hi>The Miniſtry is appointed for ſpiritual Government in the Church, to admoniſh thoſe that are diſorderly, to caſt out prophane and obſtinate ſinners.</hi> For this end they have the <hi>ſpiritual Keyes of the kingdom of Heaven</hi> vouchſafed to them, and in the due adminiſtration thereof, God hath promiſed his gracious confirmation. Hence it is, that they are called <hi>Governours, Rulers, Pastours</hi>; all which demonſtrate, that a Miniſtry is not only in doctrinal publication of the word of God, but in a ſpiritual governing and ordering of people to ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ends. Indeed the Apoſtle ſaith, This power is <hi>given us for edification, not deſtruction,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.8. all is for ſpiritual ends: It's to ſave the ſouls of thoſe that are under us. This, though accounted auſtere, yet is profitable and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, even as Government in the Commonwealth. Thus you ſee the ends of a Miniſtry.</p>
            <p>Therefore fourthly, when we ſay, <hi>God hath appointed a Miniſtry thus for ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual ends,</hi> this implyeth, <hi>God will bleſſe and go along with it, unleſſe mens ſins do hinder it.</hi> We may not think God hath appointed theſe things in vain, or for a meer form; Doth not the Apoſtle ſay, That if the Goſpel be not the word of life, it is to <hi>them that periſh?</hi> 2 Cor. 2. who performed the Office of a Goſpel Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter more faithfully then Chriſt himſelf? And who might expect greater ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe in his Miniſtry then he? Yet we hear him complaining, <hi>Who hath believed
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:65216:300"/>
our report?</hi> Oh then, let that people, that Congregation tremble, which hath long enjoyed the Miniſtry, yet as ignorant and prophane as ever! Oh conſider with thy ſelf and ſay, O Lord, thy arm is not ſhortned, thou art as able to break and humble the hearts of ſinners, as ever, therefore ſome heavy ſpiritual judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is upon me, I may fear, I am like that curſed fig-tree, upon which (Chriſt ſaid) <hi>Never fruit grow more!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now that this Miniſtry is to be to the end of the world, while God hath a Church here, appeareth by theſe Arguments,</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The ends of the Office are perpetual, therefore the office it ſelf is perpetual.</hi> The end is to convert, to build up, to preſerve from errours, to admoniſh and rebuke; Will there not be this work to be done alwayes? Heaven is like Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe that needed no rain, there were waters from within refreſhed it; but the Church while militant, is like the ground that needeth the former and later rain.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>It appeareth by Gods promiſe to them,</hi> Mat. ult. <hi>I will be with you to the end of the world,</hi> and here all that ſhall believe at any time, are ſaid to believe by their word; he is ſaid <hi>to hold the ſeven ſtars in his hand,</hi> Rev. 3.1.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>The duties that are injoyned people reſpectively to them are perpetual, as to hear them, highly to eſteem of them for their works ſake, to ſubmit themſelves unto them.</hi> Theſe are duties required of a Church, as long as it is a Church, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it's implyed they muſt have ſuch teachers, and officers.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>The ſimilitude that the Scripture uſeth about them, and the Church, inforceth their perpetuity.</hi> They are <hi>light,</hi> the world will alwayes need the Sun and Stars.

They are <hi>ſheep,</hi> and ſuch muſt have a <hi>ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd.</hi> They are the <hi>houſe of God,</hi> then there muſt be <hi>ſtewards</hi> to diſpenſe the things of life.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>God threatens it as the ſoreſt of judgements, to remove their Paſtors and Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers into corners. To remove the Candleſtick away,</hi> Rev. 2.5.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>There are directions for the qualifications of ſuch who are to be ordained Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, given by</hi> Paul <hi>to</hi> Timothy <hi>and</hi> Titus, <hi>which are to be kept unblameably, till the coming of Chriſt.</hi>

in which ſome Beleevers are compared to the ſeveral members of the body, and Chriſt to the head, becauſe of that ſpiritual life and motion they receive from him; This is the foundation of our viſible union, and without this though we may be outwardly of the Church, yet we do indeed receive no ſaving advantage by Chriſt. Of this union the Text ſpeaks not, becauſe it's ſuch an Union, that the world ſeeing it may thereby be induced to believe Therefore 2. there is a <hi>viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion,</hi> whereby Believers do outwardly and viſibly expreſſe their compacted nearneſſe to one another, and ſo thoſe particular Churches of <hi>Corinth</hi> and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſus</hi> are called Chriſts body in reſpect of their external union as well as inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, for not only by faith, but alſo by the Ordinances we have fellowſhip with Chriſt, and with one another, Of this viſible Unity the Text ſpeaks, and this is made a ſpecial means to bring the world to believe; Whereas on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry differences of Opinion, and ſad rents and ſects in Religion is the only way to confirm men in their impiety, and to think there is no truth, and no religion at all</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">II. Viſible.</note>In the ſecond place, This viſible Union doth diffuſe it ſelf in many Branches: As 1. <hi>There is an unity of Faith and profeſſion,</hi> when they all believe and ſpeak the ſame thing; This muſt be laid as the foundation of unity, for unity in errour and idolatry, or falſe waies, is not peace, but a faction or Conſpiracy; This unity of faith is reckoned among the many unities, the Apoſtle mentioneth <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.5. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.2. <hi>They are exhorted to be of one minde,</hi> and the Apoſtle notably preſſeth this, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.10. <hi>that they ſpeak the ſame thing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perfectly joyned together in the ſame minde, and the ſame judgement</hi>: What a ſad breach then hath the devil made upon Gods people, when there are ſo few of the ſame minde, and do judge the ſame things; but (as you heard) it muſt be a ſameneſſe and unity in the true Faith, for the Jews they are one amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, the Mahumetans are one, the Papiſts are ſo one that they boaſt of it, and make it a note of the true Church; Now though this ſhould be granted (though they have a thouſand diviſions amongſt themſelves) yet unleſs it be unity in the faith, unity in the ſound doctrine it is nothing at all.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>There is an unity of affection and love in the heart, and outwardly one to another,</hi> Love is called the affection of union, and makes a man to be the object he loveth as much as his own, and we ſee the praier of Chriſt abundantly fulfilled in this reſpect concerning the Primitive Chriſtians, for <hi>Act.</hi> 4 32. it's ſaid, <hi>they were of one heart and of one ſoul</hi>; Thoſe thouſands of believers were as if they had but one heart and ſoul among them; and thus in <hi>Tertullians</hi> time the heathens did admire at the love Chriſtians had to one another, our Saviour makes it a ſurer ſign of diſcipleſhip then if they wrought miracles, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.35.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>This union is ſeen in the publike worſhip and Ordinances which God hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi> as God ſaid of man at firſt, it was not good he ſhould be alone, So it's true of every believer, he is not to ſerve God alone, to think that a private Religion is enough; Therefore you have the examples of the primitive Chriſtians, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.1. <hi>Act.</hi> 5.12. how they <hi>met with one accord in one place,</hi> and that to have the enjoyment of publike Ordinances, they praied together, the Word was preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them, they received the Sacraments together, and the Apoſtle 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16, 17. ſheweth how the Sacrament of the Lords Supper did declare their uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and communion one with another; Hence <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.25.

               </gap>ſible union of believers in Church-Ordinances is their higheſt beauty and their chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt advantage; Hence <hi>David</hi> profeſſeth his raviſhment herein, <hi>How beautiful are thy Tabernacles O Lord of hoſts!</hi> and <hi>Pſa.</hi> 110. it's called <hi>the beauties of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> and <hi>Hag.</hi> 2. this temple is ſaid to be <hi>more glorious then ever the former was</hi>; and that becauſe of Chriſts preſence therein, preaching and reforming all abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and corruptions: When the Ark was taken <hi>Phinehas</hi> his daughter cried, <hi>The glory is departed from Iſrael</hi>; Hence the Ordinances even in this life are called the
<pb n="563" facs="tcp:65216:301"/>
Kingdom of heaven becauſe of Gods glorious preſence therein; <hi>David</hi> when baniſhed <hi>Pſa.</hi> 63.2. longed to ſee the <hi>glory of God as he had ſeen it in the Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>; And then its our greateſt profit and advantage, for Gods preſence is promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to theſe, So that the Chriſtian Ordinances are the life of the Church; There is a larger diſpenſation of Gods gifts and graces here then otherwiſe.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>This unity is ſeen in that publike order and government which Chriſt hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in his Church,</hi> as God hath appointed ſome to be Shepherds, and to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern, ſo others to hear and obey, he hath commanded admonition, and in ſome caſes ſharp reproof, and where obſtinacy is, to caſt out; Now it's very hard to have unity in this reſpect, for as 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 14. it appeareth private Chriſtians do dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultly keep within their ſphere, every member would be an eye, as the Apoſtle there chargeth, ſo it's hard to meet with an obedient ear, though to a wiſe, and godly reproof; It's therefore a bleſſed thing, as to have unity of faith, ſo alſo of order, That is to ſee every member of the Church with its relation in an har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious way, as it's in the body, though they be heterogeneal parts, yet they all harmoniouſly conſociate in their operations; This unity of order is like the nerves and ligaments to this ſpiritual ſociety.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>This unity is ſeen in the ſympathizing that all believers have one with another,</hi> and that in reſpect of mourning and rejoycing; In reſpect of thoſe that mourn, So we are to weep and mourn with them; We are to bear one anothers burdens; We are to be affected with the Churches calamities as being alſo of the body; As the Apoſtle ſaid, <hi>the care of all Churches lay upon him,</hi> 2 Cor. 11.28. <hi>Who was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted and he did not burn?</hi> the ſame proportionably is to be in every believer: Therefore this unity of believers ſhould be vigorous this way, what evils, what exerciſes befall others, they ſhould be affected with them as their own; This diſcovers they are lively members of the body, for if Chriſt though in Heaven was ſenſible of the perſecutions done by <hi>Paul</hi> againſt the Church, ſaying, <hi>Why perſecuteſt thou me?</hi> how much rather ſhould every particular member account the temptations of others as his own; As it is thus for mourning, ſo alſo for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing, there ought to be ſuch an unity among believers, that we are to rejoyce in the gifts, graces, and good things that others have, as if they were our own; But O the ſelf-love, the envy, the repinings that are apt to be in one godly man againſt another, <hi>The ſpirit in us luſteth to envy,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, even in belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers; Hence are thoſe daily exhortations againſt grudgings, murmurings, and envyings one againſt another, and theſe are made the fruit of the fleſh, becauſe where the Spirit of God worketh and enliveneth, there is joy, peace, and long-ſuffering, all graces contrary to ſuch unquiet diſtempers; Now this is very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to fleſh and bloud, that thoſe parts and gifts which obſcure thine, and thoſe good things in others that ſeem to hinder thine, yet to rejoyce and bleſſe God for them, as if it were to thy own ſelf, but this ſpiritual and myſtical unity will enable thee thereunto<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Neither is the Sun or air more requiſite then this union, no wonder if our Saviour doth thus affectionately pray for it.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>This union is ſeen in their mutual ſtriving together, in promoting the Kingdome and glory of Chriſt</hi>; They all have the ſame heart, the ſame ſhoulders, the ſame tongue to bleſſe and praiſe God; They are like ſo many ſervants in the ſame houſe, all promoting and furthering their maſters work; That as the Apoſtle 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. ſaith, all the Officers are one, <hi>He that plants, and he that waters are one,</hi> becauſe they agree in one end, which is to ſet forward the work of God; Thus it is here, Though there be never ſo much variety in the gifts and graces, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of Gods people, yet they are all one in this work, The Glory of God is the end they all look upon; Thus you ſee in how many particulars this Unity diffuſeth it ſelf.</p>
            <p>In the third place, <hi>We are to know that the inviſible unity doth extend it ſelf far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then the viſible</hi>; For this is to the viſible Church only,<note place="margin">III.</note> but that to the invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible;
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:65216:302" rendition="simple:additions"/>
So that in this reſpect there is an unity between all believers that ever have been, with <hi>Enoch, Abel, Abraham,</hi> and all that of old ever were; This is believed in that which uſually is called the Apoſtles Creed, <hi>I believe the Catholike Church</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Sometimes there was added the one Catholike Church, and this is believed, and not ſeen, but by this it is that all the godly who have been, are, and ever ſhall be, make up one body; All Chriſts ſheep will have one ſheepfold; So that there is an inviſible Union, where there cannot be a viſible one,</p>
            <p>In the fourth place, Concerning this viſible Union (for we make theſe all one) you are to know, <hi>ſome are of this unity both viſibly and inviſibly,</hi> externally and internally, and in appearance; Now ſuch only who are both waies of this Unity, enjoy God, are indeed members of Chriſt, and receive benefit by him, but the other are only in name and title, like a withered branch in a Tree, or an artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all eye, or leg, which though joyned to the body, yet receive no life or nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof; Think it not therefore enough to be of this unity, many have glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried and reſted on this, that they are of ſuch and ſuch a Church, yet their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation is greater then thoſe of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the fifth place, <hi>This unity therefore when it's true and advantagious doth firſt terminate on Chriſt, and then deſcends to others</hi>; Hence it's added, <hi>That they may be one in us</hi>; There muſt be firſt an unity with Chriſt the Head, and then it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to other members, So that this is to be looked upon as the foundation and cauſe of all, there muſt be firſt an incorporating into Chriſt; <hi>He that is joyned to the Lord is made one ſpirit with him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, This Union viſible is not interrupted in ſome effects of it by diſtance of place; For in regard of praier, there every one is remembred, when the Churth is praied for, So that the poor Chriſtian who cannot pray for himſelf, yet hath the praiers of the whole Church of God, what a comfortable refreſhing ſhould this be to every godly ſoul.</p>

            <p>WE have declared the Nature of this Unity, Let us now conſider the Excellency, Benefit and Neceſſity of Union amongſt the godly, and the miſchiefs of breaches and differences amongſt them.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>The Excellency and Neceſſity of it appeareth in the vehement and affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate prayer for it, made by our Saviour.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. The excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of unity among Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians appears by the vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionate praier for it.</note> When he puts the whole company of believers together, he pitcheth upon this as the moſt eminent, <hi>That they may be one.</hi> And although our Saviour had not the Spirit in meaſure, and ſo could not vainly repeat the ſame thing often, yet within a little ſpace, he doth four times mention this, <hi>verſ.</hi> 21, 22, 23. Now certainly, that thing which our Saviour in whom <hi>the treaſures of all wiſdom are,</hi> did much preſs and urge, muſt needs be of very great moment, here is not pardon of their ſins, Juſtification, Adoption, Glorification mentioned, but <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> as if the whole kingdome of grace and glory did conſiſt in this, obtain this, and you have all; and our Saviour as he pray'd then, ſo he preached Love and Unity; ſo that, whereas in matter of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification he commended Faith above all, in matter of Sanctification he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends all in love, <hi>John</hi> 13.34. <hi>A new Commandment I give unto you, that ye love one another:</hi> A new Commandment, not but that the duty was old, onely envy and malice had ſo prevailed amongſt the Jews, that to love was a new thing, as if it had not been a duty required before. In <hi>John</hi>'s Epiſtles it's called both <hi>new</hi> and <hi>old,</hi> 1 John 2.8. And then again <hi>new,</hi> becauſe there are new mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, and a new patern, <hi>Love one another, as I have loved you</hi>; There was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſuch a Patern and Preſident before; ſo that it's not every kinde of love and unity which will give content, but that which is in the higheſt degree of unity, it's added <hi>verſ.</hi> 35. <hi>By this ſhall all men know ye 'are my Diſciples, if ye love one another</hi>; not if ye work miracles, if ye caſt out devils, but if you caſt out diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord and variance; and therefore there is not a greater ſcandal to Religion and holines, then when thoſe that do believe, are as the <hi>Levites</hi> Concubine, that was cut into many peeces. Again, <hi>Ch.</hi> 15.12. <hi>This is my Commandment that ye love one another, as I have loved you</hi>; This is Chriſts Commandment, as if there were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe he required but this; and as if this were not enough, at <hi>verſe</hi> 17. <hi>Theſe things I command you, that ye love one another</hi>; as if he ſhould have ſaid, If bare information will not do it; if inſtruction will not do it, I lay my command and charge upon you.</p>

               <note place="margin">2. Its a means to bring the world to believe the truth.</note>Secondly, <hi>This <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity and Love is a ſpecial means to bring the world to believe the truth, and receive Chriſt.</hi> So that what the preaching of the Word, and Gifts, yea miracles uſe to do, that unity and agreement may do. This is twice affirmed to be the conſequent of unity, <hi>verſ.</hi> 21. &amp; <hi>verſ.</hi> 23. <hi>That the world may believe thou haſt ſent me.</hi> It's a ſpecial way to convince all the enemies of the truth. Thus <hi>Chap.</hi> 13.35. <hi>Men ſhall know ye are my Diſciples, if ye love one another:</hi> and do we not ſee by experience, That Papiſts, Heretiques, and all prophane men are confirmed in their wickedneſſe, by nothing more then the differences and opinions of ſuch who are godly: Do they not by books, and otherwiſe in deriſion ſay, One Sect ſaith, that hath the Spirit of God, another ſaith, that hath, and yet both are contrary one to another: Can the Spirit of God be contrary to it ſelf? Can it be a Spirit of truth in one, and a Spirit of falſhood in others? Now although this be no good argument, becauſe the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God is communicated, but in meaſure to the godly, <hi>they know but in part, and ſo they love but in part,</hi> many errours and diviſions we are prone unto, yet this is a very great ſtumbling block, and therefore woe be to that godly man, who by his pride, ſelf-conceit, or erroneous Doctrine ſhall bring ſuch a ſcandal to Religion, what if many periſh in hell, becauſe of thy froward ſpirit. It is true, there ought to be zeal againſt errours and corruptions, though in the godly. You ſee when <hi>Peter</hi> did not walk right, <hi>Paul reſiſted him to the face, and would not give place to him,</hi> or other falſe teachers, <hi>no not for an hour,</hi> Gal. 2.5. Mark that, <hi>No, not for an hour</hi>; Some think, let them alone, they will recover themſelves, they will do no hurt, truth needs not be afraid, yet <hi>Paul</hi> was afraid that an hours forbearance might do hurt; Therefore he addeth, <hi>That the truth of the Goſpel might continue amongst you,</hi> as if an hours forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance might hinder the continuance of truth; ſo that we are to uſe Scripture-zeal, and Scripture-means to convince even thoſe that are godly, when erring in Doctrine: Therefore the Scripture doth not commend an unity and love, ſo as to let all errours and prophaneneſſe alone, but in that which is good, unity in that which is truth and holineſſe, is that which Chriſt meaneth here in his prayer, and where this is, it's very potent to winne all gain-ſayers: It's admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to mollifie the hearts of the oppoſers: Hence it's ſo often reported of the primitive Chriſtians, <hi>That they were daily with one accord together:</hi> Therefore the Evangeliſt <hi>Luke</hi> records it at leaſt five times: ſo that if nothing elſe ſhould make thee tender about cauſing any breaches in the Church of God, this ſhould, thou doſt as much as lieth in thee, to hinder any man that knoweth thee, ever to believe, and to be converted.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">3. Its promiſed as a ſpecial part of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</note>Thirdly, <hi>This <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity is promiſed as a ſpecial part of the Covenant of Grace.</hi> That very Covenant, which promiſeth <hi>to write the Law of God in our hearts, and to put his fear in our inward parts,</hi> that alſo promiſeth unity at the ſame time, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.39. <hi>I will be their God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and they ſhall be my people, I will give them one heart, and one way, that they may fear me for ever:</hi> Inſomuch that it's one main branch in the Covenant of Grace: So <hi>Zech</hi> 14.9. <hi>In that day, there ſhall be one Lord, and his name one:</hi> The meaning is, They ſhall not worſhip many gods, or ſerve in different wayes of worſhip, but they ſhall be one. To this purpoſe <hi>Ezekiel</hi> propheſieth, <hi>Chap.</hi> 37.16, 22. which is not to be limited to the Jews only, but alſo to all the believing <hi>Gentiles:</hi> Oh then in theſe times of differences, and breaches amongſt the godly! What ſhould we runne unto? What ſhould we plead in prayer, but theſe promiſes? O Lord, to be thus divided, to have <hi>Altar</hi> againſt <hi>Altar, Church</hi> againſt <hi>Church, Prophet</hi> againſt <hi>Prophet!</hi> Is this to have one heart, and one way?</p>
            <p>But you may ſay, <hi>If God hath thus promiſed it, and Chriſt hath prayed for it, who was heard of the Father in every thing, How comes it about that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary appeareth?</hi> This is to be anſwered in it's time.</p>

And this may be the reaſon, why our Saviour doth not mention the Sanctification and holineſſe of believers, but their unity, becauſe this is a ſpecial means to preſerve and increaſe holineſſe, <hi>Two are better then one, becauſe of heat and of help,</hi> ſaith the Wiſe-man, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 4.10. and ſo it's in this work of Grace, two are better then one to warm one another; How may thy zeal help againſt anothers lukewarmneſſe, thy faith againſt anothers diffidence? If it be ſo great a ſinne to ſee thy brother in temporal want, and not relieve him, How much more in ſpiritual, and ſo for help, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.1. <hi>If any be overta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, ye that are ſpiritual reſtore ſuch an one</hi>; Put this bone in joynt again: Now doth not experience tell us, that where diviſions and diſcord are, there is no love, no compaſſion, no watching over one another, if this unity were eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, a man would then endeavour the growth of grace in others, as in his own ſelf; and therefore obſerve, whether the power of godlineſſe doth not much abate, when differences do ariſe: There is not that heavenly communion, nor hearty concurrence in the waies of holineſs. There is not that mutual help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of one another, as at other times.</p>

Thus the Martyrs, ſome of them in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> dayes, did bewail their differences and conteſts they had formerly one with another, but the priſon and perſecution made them highly prize one another. <hi>Joſephs</hi> brethren in their plenty envied and fell out with one another, but in their diſtreſſe they were glad to cleave together. The ſheep that were ſcattered one from another, when a ſudden ſtorm ariſeth, makes them all company together: It may be though the godly are ſo cenſorious, ſo ſhie, ſo ſtrange to one another. God may in time work ſo, that they may be glad to enjoy one another, glad to have the communion of each other; one godly mans company may be more then the gold of <hi>Ophir</hi>; and therefore if love and godlineſſe do not unite you, take heed God doth not make ſome out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward trouble and affliction to put you together; If you do not imbrace one another willingly, he may binde you in his chains together. That promiſe to <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael,</hi> of making thoſe <hi>two ſticks one,</hi> was after the cruel enmity and oppoſition which had been amongſt them.</p>

The old Rule is, <hi>Vis unita ſortior,</hi> the Sunne beams united together caſt the greater heat. It's union in an Army, in a Nation, in any Society that preſerveth it; as a Wiſe-man ſaid, Publique Societies are immortal, if they do not kill themſelves by diviſion; Our Saviour confirmed this, when he ſaid, <hi>No Kingdome divided againſt it ſelf can ſtand, Matth.</hi> 12.25. He brings this as an argument, That he did not caſt out devils by the help of devils, but by the Spirit of God. Thus if the people of God caſt out errour and prophaneneſſe by Gods Spirit, then they will not entertain the like themſelves; for this would be to ſet a Kingdome at variance within it ſelf.

The old Rule is, <hi>Divide &amp; impera:</hi> It was a peculiar providence, that Chriſts bones ſhould not be broken, to demonſtrate hereby (ſay ſome) that Chriſt, though he died, yet he did not loſe his ſtrength. We muſt juſtly fear God hath ſome heavy ſcourge upon the godly, when they are firſt divided, if their bones are broken, their ſtrength is weakened; their evil and miſery will not ſtay there: So that it's a very fooliſh and weak thing in the godly to continue in their divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; for have they not mighty and numberleſſe enemies? Doth not the whole world hate them? Are they not as Wolves to the godly, who are as Sheep? Now if not only the Wolf and the Fox, but alſo one Sheep ſhall devour ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Muſt not this bring utter ruine? The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks fully to this, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.15. <hi>If ye bite and devour one another, take heed ye be not conſumed of one another:</hi> Obſerve the notable expreſſion, <hi>biting</hi> and <hi>devouring one another,</hi> How unnatural is this to ſheep, dogs uſe to do ſo? And further, by this means you will conſume one another; That which the devils of hell, and all the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked adverſaries thereof could not do, that you will do to one another, <hi>En quo diſcordia cives perduxit miſeros!</hi> Look not then upon your differences, as meer ſinnes, but heavy prognoſtiques of Gods wrath.

            <p>WE are deſcribing the Excellency of Union, and the miſchief of breach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es amongſt the godly, we ſhall adde to the fore mentioned, As</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Diviſions and differences they are the fruit of the fleſh</hi>; Whereas love,<note place="margin">9. Diviſions are the fruit of the fleſh.</note> peace, and kindeneſſe they are the fruits of the Spirit, ſo that a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not more demonſtrate himſelf to be in the fleſh, and devoid of Gods Spirit in any thing then by a contentious dividing ſpirit; There are ſome men like thoſe old Spaniards the hiſtorian ſpeaks of, that cannot live without an enemy, So theſe <hi>Salamanders</hi> can only be in the fire, they are unquiet reſtleſs men, and theſe like <hi>Marcion</hi> with great boldneſſe and delight will cry out, we will caſt fire into the Church and divide it, But theſe demonſtrate of what nature they are, and who is their Father, even that envious one, the devil, who delights to ſow tares amongſt the wheat, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.20, 21. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> you may there ſee two chief princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of mens actions in the world, whereof the one is immediatly oppoſite to the other, the fleſh and the Spirit, now it's good to obſerve what the works of the one and the other are; of the fleſh, he inſtanceth in <hi>hatred, variance, ſtrife, emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> &amp;c. all tending to break unity, and of the ſpirit the clean contrary, <hi>love, peace, gentleneſs,</hi> &amp;c. all uniting, If then we would know who is a godly man, who hath the Spirit of God; <hi>Judge of the Tree by its fruit,</hi> he is full of love, gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſs, and meekneſs; It's impoſſible that pride, arrogancy, and envyings ſhould be the fruit of Gods Spirit; Hence the Apoſtle 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. doth thus argue, <hi>If there be envyings and diviſions among you, are you not carnal?</hi> Thus the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> c. 3.13, 14. ſpeaks notably to this, <hi>Who is a wiſe man? let him ſhew it by a good converſation with meekneſſe,</hi> he divides wiſedom into that which is earthly and deviliſh, the mother of envyings and ſtrife, and <hi>the wiſedome from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, which is firſt pure and then peaceable,</hi> yea, <hi>verſe</hi> 14. Whoſoever hath the Name of Religion, yet is haunted with this devil: The Apoſtle bids him <hi>glory not,</hi> and <hi>lye not againſt the Truth,</hi> So that though a man pretend never ſuch ſingular gifts, ſuch extraordinary Teachings of Gods Spirit, yet if contentious, he is not to glory<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yea, he lieth againſt the Truth; Thou ſaiſt,
<pb n="571" facs="tcp:65216:305"/>
it's for the truth thou art thus contentious, It's for the truth thou haſt made theſe diviſions, No, the truths of Chriſt are to be maintained by the Spirit of Chriſt, <hi>As the wrath of man worketh not the righteouſneſſe of God,</hi> ſo neither doth the perverſeneſſe of man the truths of God, ſo far then as any in the Church of God are contentious and ſtriving, ſo farre they demonſtrate the power of the fleſh reigning in them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This Unity is neceſſary, <hi>becauſe all other things in Religion are reduced to one</hi>;<note place="margin">10. Becauſe all things are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to one.</note> If therefore all things agree in unity, every thing in Religion tends to this; Why ſhould not the people of God embrace it?

Let grace do that in this myſtical body which nature doth in this natural; Then <hi>there is one Spirit,</hi> There is but one Spirit that enlightens and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifieth the whole Church of God, why then ſhould there be ſo many contrary opinions and waies, yet pretended to be of the ſame Spirit? Indeed the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>there are diverſity of gifts and operations, yet the ſame Spirit</hi>; He doth not ſay contrarieties and the ſame Spirit, for that is as impoſſible as darkneſs to come from the Sun; If then there be but one Spirit, let not the godly give occaſions to the adverſaries to blaſpheme, ſaying, the <hi>Calviniſtical</hi> Spirit is one thing, and the <hi>Lutheran</hi> ſpirit another; Again, <hi>there is one hope of our calling,</hi> we are called to one Inheritance, there is only one Heaven prepared for all the godly, Why then ſhould they be ſo different by the way, when at our journeys end we muſt all be received into the ſame place of glory; It is true our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.2. <hi>In his Fathers houſe are many manſion places</hi>; There is room enough for all, yet it's but one houſe, if one Church cannot now contain us, how ſhall we think one heaven will? It followeth, <hi>there is one Lord,</hi> that is Chriſt, who is to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiped and ſerved by us; Indeed if there were many Lords, as the Papiſts ſet up many Saints in heaven to have their peculiar worſhip, then no wonder if there were ſeveral faiths and worſhips alſo, but the Lord Chriſt is one; This the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle urged the <hi>Corinthians</hi> with to compoſe their diviſions, <hi>Is Chriſt divided?</hi> 1 Corin. 1.13. unleſſe there were many Chriſts, or Chriſt be divided into many parts, there ought not to be many diviſions in the Church; how abſurd would it be to ſay, I have one Chriſt, and another he hath another, a third a third Chriſt; There <hi>is one faith,</hi> one ſyſteme of doctrine to be believed, Though there may be many particulars, yet they make up one intire Truth, So that although there be many Religions, and many faiths in the world, yet indeed there is but one; E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>There are <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> called gods,</hi> nuncupative gods, <hi>but to us there is one only God,</hi> So there are many called Religions, many called Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, but indeed there is one only; The next argument is, <hi>there is one Baptiſm,</hi> that is one profeſſion of the doctrine of faith; Though there is not one baptiſm in number, yet there is one in kinde; Chriſt hath appointed but one way for the profeſſion of his name<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and being called upon by us; The Sacrament of the Lords Supper is alſo made an argument of unity, 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 10.17. So that the Sacraments in their ſignification denote <hi>unity</hi>; They manifeſt one body, one ſpirit, how ſad then is it that ſo many <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ents and diviſions ſhould be made in the Church about Sacraments, which yet are the bodies and ſeals of unity and communion! Laſtly, <hi>there is one God and Father of all</hi>; Becauſe there is one God only, therefore we
<pb n="572" facs="tcp:65216:306"/>
ought to be at unity, God being One cannot be divided in himſelf, he cannot command things to be believed or done contrary to himſelf; Therefore let all theſe unities make us ſerious in endeavouring after unity, yea, we might adde, that in hell there is unity, all the devils agree againſt the Church, There could be a Legion of devils in one man; Shall there then be unity againſt us, and not we at unity among our ſelves?</p>

               </note>1. <hi>Though unity among the godly be thus neceſſary, yet that inferreth neceſſarily diviſions and oppoſitions to the world,</hi> and therefore we are not to wonder if the Goſpel and powerful diſpenſing of Chriſts waies makes fractions and troubles in the world, for the godly cannot have peace with themſelves but they muſt be in open oppoſition to the world; Therefore in this Chapter, and in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces our Saviour informs them that <hi>the world will hate them,</hi> So that we are not to ſay, That the Goſpel of Chriſt is in it ſelf of a turbulent dividing nature, as car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Politicians ſuggeſt, and that therefore the beſt peace and unity is where <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſm</hi> doth abound, for if by the Goſpel there be ſad diſtractions and concuſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Kingdoms and States, it's not from the <hi>genius</hi> of the Goſpel, but from the oppoſition and corruption of mens hearts; Therefore when our Saviour ſaid, <hi>he came to ſend fire and ſword in the earth,</hi> Luk. 12.49. <hi>that Father ſhould be againſt Son, and mother againſt daughter, That a mans Enemies ſhould be thoſe of his own houſe</hi>; This was not from the nature of Chriſts doctrine but the corrupt indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the ſubject, as when the Sun doth offend ſoar eyes, or the medicine and potions taken diſturb the humours and makes a man the ſicker, in theſe ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes not the Sun or the Phyſician is to be blamed, So if the Introduction of Chriſts Kingdom and his Ordinances make great diviſions in a place; It's not Chriſts way but wicked mens ſins that are to be blamed; This then is to be concluded upon, that the godly and the wicked can have no unity, The godly may not come off to the worlds principles, and the world will not come off to the godly mans principles, and therefore there muſt be a perpetual enmity, which made the Wiſe man ſay, <hi>That the Righteous was an abomination to the wicked, and the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked to the Righteous</hi>; Pro. 29.27.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Seeing there cannot be unity between Sheep and Wolves, the godly and the wicked, hence it is that even in the Church of God there being ſo many ſtill that retain their beaſtly nature, and though they have the title of Chriſtians, yet are really of the devil, hence it is that in Chriſts Church there is many times ſuch deadly oppoſition; Wonder not then if among thoſe that yet pretend highly to Chriſt there be ſad diviſions, for many are in the fleſh ſtill, many ſavour not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimentally the things of God, <hi>There ſhall ariſe among you men that ſhall ſpeak perverſe things,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.30. So <hi>there ſhall be falſe Prophets who will bring in damnable hereſies,</hi> 2 Pet. 2. and why? <hi>becauſe they are men of corrupt mindes</hi>; If then all that pretend to Chriſt, to his Spirit, had indeed Chriſts Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, there would be no ſuch diviſions, but ſaith the Apoſtle 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. <hi>They went from us, becauſe they were not of us,</hi> and 1 <hi>Co.</hi> 11. <hi>there muſt be hereſies that the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſuch as are ſound may be eſteemed</hi>; Therefore though Chriſt hath thus praied, and God
<pb n="573" facs="tcp:65216:306"/>
thus promiſed, yet in the Church there will be grievous rents, becauſe theſe are not of the Church though in the Church, and therefore were not included in Gods promiſe or Chriſts praier; Hence it is that the Scripture is full of ſuch pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, that there ſhall ariſe <hi>falſe Prophets,</hi> that there ſhall be <hi>wolves in ſheeps clothes,</hi> that <hi>Satan will transform himſelf into an Angel of light,</hi> by which if it were poſſible the very <hi>Elect</hi> would be ſeduced; Therefore you are not thus to argue when you ſee raging diviſions amongſt thoſe that profeſſe faith in Chriſt and holineſs, that therefore Chriſt praied in vain, or that there is no Truth, no Religion at all, but rather that there are many hypocrites in the Church, many who for their pride, rebell on againſt the Light, and other ſins, ſhall be left by God, and given up to believe a lye, From ſuch differences conclude upon this pious meditation, That even under the known light of the Goſpel men may ſadly apoſtatize, and become heretikes, yea perſecutors of the Truth, if the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God keep them not in an holy fear; Therefore in the midſt of theſe diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences ſay, there is a ſeeming believer, a ſeeming Church, a ſeeming profeſſor, and ſuch commonly for ſome corrupt end or other make a breach in Chriſts body.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>There is an unity in fundamentals or eſſentials, and an unity in circumſtantials or leſſe principals</hi>; Now as when God hath promiſed, and Chriſt praied for the ſanctification of his people, hereby they are ſeen to have ſo much grace as ſhall certainly bring them to heaven, for though they have not all the degrees of grace, and neither are freed from all ſin, yet they have the eſſence of grace that will certainly bring to eternal glory; Thus it is in <hi>unity,</hi> although in many things they have not attained to the ſame minde, to the ſame judgement, <hi>yet they all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in thoſe things, that are neceſſary to ſalvation, and this is called all truth, The Spirit of God ſhall leade them into all Truth,</hi> Joh. 26.13. and they have <hi>the unction which teacheth them all things,</hi> 1 Joh. 2.20. Hence <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. it's not poſſible to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Elect, <hi>viz.</hi> in fundamental things, ſuch as ſhall exclude Salvation; It's true, the diſciples doubted a while about Chriſts Reſurrection, which was a fundamental Point, but it's one thing to doubt, and another thing heretical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to oppoſe it; The godly then cannot live and die in a fundamental errour, no more then in a groſſe ſin unrepented of, becauſe theſe do neceſſarily oppoſe ſalvation, and this may be a great comfort to the godly under the diverſity of Opinions and ſeveral ſubtle waies of thoſe who would bring in damnable He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Even in acceſſories and leſſe principals their unity ſhall be conſummated in Heaven, and ſo we muſt underſtand Chriſts Praier as in his other Petitions, with an extent to heaven, where is the compleating of all grace and holineſſe; The comfort is, that one day all the godly will lay aſide their bitterneſſe and cenſures of one another, They will all with one mouth, and in one way, praiſe and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie God without any difference at all.</p>

            <p>THe next thing in order to be treated on concerning this Unity, is the <hi>Cautions</hi> that are to be attended unto about it: For the name of Unity, like that of peace, is very ſpecious and fair, yet as <hi>Hierom</hi> ſaid, <hi>Curſed be that peace which forſakes the truth:</hi> So curſed be that unity which ſhall prejudice the Kingdom of Chriſt. Conſpiracy and a ſinfull confederacy in ways of ſinne, may be painted over, as if it were this glorious unity commended by Chriſt. And</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">1. True unity is from Chriſt and termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in him. There is a wicked unity.</note>Firſt, Let this be conſidered, <hi>That the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity which Chriſt commends and prayeth for, is originally from Chriſt, and terminated in him, and afterwards in thoſe things that are his, his truth, his wayes, his commands.</hi> So that whatſoever unity doth not begin there, and afterwards diffuſe it ſelf to thoſe things, is a ſinfull and wicked unity. The Devil hath unity in his Kingdom; all the Devils, though full of malice and envy to man, yet agree in their wickedneſs. Though one wicked man may fall out with another, yet one devil doth not with another. There is order amongſt them. There is the prince of the devils, a legion of them could poſſeſſe one man: So that if we look into hell, we ſhall finde no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but unity and agreement amongſt them, yet all is in their work againſt Chriſt and his Church. Thus there is alſo an <hi>Antichriſtian <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> the Papiſts glory in their unity, that they all acknowledge one way, yea they make it a mark of their Church: And in the world, we ſee all wicked men are as one man in oppoſing what is godly. Now ſuch unity as this, is matter of ſhame and mourning. For, 1. <hi>It's not terminated on Chriſt</hi>; they are not firſt united to the true Head, this oil is not firſt on <hi>Aarons</hi> head; but they are of the devil, who doth move and reign in their hearts. And, 2. <hi>It's not an unity in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture way,</hi> not an union in the true Doctrine, but hereſie, not an union in the inſtituted worſhip of God, but idolatry and ſuperſtition, an union to overthrow Chriſts Kingdom, if it were poſſible. Look we then to the cauſe and object of our unity, elſe it will afford no true comfort.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">2. A directed and ordered unity.</note>Secondly, <hi>This unity muſt be a directed and ordered unity.</hi> This unity muſt not be confuſion. That Chaos and unformed heap God created at firſt, it was one thing, but it was confuſed, it was without form. An houſe demoliſhed makes one heap, but it's a ruinous diſordered one: So then the Scripture uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is that which keeps the order and diſtinction God hath appointed; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed this is greatly to be preſſed, leſt under this pretence of unity, that all the people of God are one, we ſhould introduce a confuſion, and make Chriſts bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
<pb n="575" facs="tcp:65216:307" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Monſtrum horrendum,</hi> &amp;c. Though the Church be that one body of Chriſt, yet in it there are diſtinct members, and all have their ſeveral operations: So that the Apoſtle argueth againſt thoſe that would confound this order; <hi>Are all the members of the body an eye?</hi> 1 Cor. 12.14, 15, 16. This hath many times ſore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly troubled the Church. Men through pride and corrupt ends would not reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly keep that order and diſtinction God hath made in his Church: Hence the Apoſtle ſo often preſſeth the people to <hi>hear, to obey, to ſubmit themſelves unto their Governours, to have them in high eſteem for their works ſake,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 5.13. And why is all this? But becauſe while this unity of order is preſerved, the Church it ſelf and godlineſſe is preſerved.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>This unity is conſiſtent with ſuch graces,</hi>
               <note place="margin">3. It is conſiſtent with ſuch gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that yet have an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving unity.</note> 
               <hi>that yet have an outward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, of diſſolving unity, as zeal for the glory of God, ſharp and ſevere reproof of ſuch as go aſtray, to ſuffer no hereſies or prophaneneſſe after admonition in ſuch who are of the Church.</hi> And certainly this is much to be obſerved, As there is a ſinfull and fooliſh pity, when men would not have juſtice done againſt notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous offenders, which pity to the wicked is truly called cruelty to the good; for he that is pitifull to the wolf, is cruell to the ſheep: So there is a counterfeit, diſguiſed unity and love, and that is, when becauſe of this peace and agreement, no damnable hereſie, no corrupt or evil way is to be ſeverely dealt with, and a Scripture-way taken to ſtop the progreſſe of it. If this were true, then <hi>Ahab</hi> did upon good grounds call <hi>Elijah, a troubler of Iſrael,</hi> becauſe his zeal would not bear the Idolatries then practiſed: If this were true, then all the godly Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets were juſtly diſcouraged, becauſe they reproved the ſinfull wayes of the times they lived in: Yea then, Chriſt himſelf and his Apoſtles were juſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, for the zeal of God did ſo eat them up, that they reproved not only the groſſe Idolatries, but almoſt every petty ſuperſtitious way: What ſhall we think the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> who doth ſo often commend the ſpirit of love and meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, That <hi>there be no hatred or ſtrife amongst them,</hi> yet when he ſaith; <hi>I would they were cut off that trouble you,</hi> Gal. 5.12. <hi>and their mouths muſt be ſtopt,</hi> Tit. 2.11. <hi>that ſpeak perverſe things,</hi> that he forgets his own rule, and becomes an incendiary in the Church? or ſhall we think the Apoſtle <hi>John,</hi> who preſſeth love in every verſe, and ſheweth, <hi>He that hateth his brother, is like Cain a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer, and of the devil</hi>; yet when he ſaith, <hi>If any one bring any other Doctrine, then you have received</hi> (2 epiſt. John 10) <hi>receive not that man into your houſe, or bid him, God ſpeed</hi>; that now he hath forgot his own ſpirit, that his honey is turned into gall? Be then fully perſwaded, that the unity and love Chriſt pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for, doth not oppoſe Scripture-zeal, and courage againſt any prophane and erroneous wayes: It doth not bring in a compliance and ſymbolizing with all hereſies and prophaneneſſe. It doth not erect a Temple, as the <hi>Romans</hi> did to all gods: Nor make the Church like the Ark, wherein all beaſts clean and unclean were received. No, ſuch remiſneſs breaketh unity; as the ſtrings not well-wound up cannot make any melodious ſound, and the paralytical members of the body, for want of the due firmneſſe, cauſe many feeble operations. There is a Sect called the <hi>Family of Love,</hi> as if they only had peace and unity amongſt them, but they would have all things, even wives common, and ſo their unity is a fomenter of ſinne, and confounds thoſe relations God hath di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed.</p>
            <p>Theſe Cautions premiſed,<note place="margin">Remedies for the preventing and healing diviſions in the Church.</note> 
               <hi>Let us conſider what remedies are fit to heal theſe wounds.</hi> As in the natural b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>dy, a wound is <hi>Solutio continui</hi>; ſo in this ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual body of the Church, and as to wounds, unleſs there be wiſdome and skill, they are made worſe by Empericks. Thus unleſs there be proportionable and fit remedies applied with wiſdom and compaſſion, the breach is made greater.<note place="margin">Falſe wayes of unity.</note> And</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>There are two remedies,</hi> and they are in extreams:<note place="margin">1. By Papiſts.</note> The one <hi>ſuggeſted</hi>
               <pb n="576" facs="tcp:65216:308"/>
by the <hi>Popiſh party,</hi> the other by the <hi>Socinian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt is, <hi>A rigid, imperious and tyrannical commanding of an uniformity and approbation in every punctilio, and minute particular:</hi> So that no diſſent or liberty ſhall be allowed to a man, though humble and peaceable, earneſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring to finde out the truth. This tyranny came into the Church betimes; What a large breach did <hi>Victor</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> make in the Church about the determinate time of keeping of <hi>Eaſter,</hi> whom <hi>Irenaeus</hi> did gravely oppoſe? Certainly, the Apoſtle <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. in matters of leſſe concernment, where men may erre <hi>ſalvâ fide,</hi> or when men build only <hi>hay and ſtubble, not laying other foundations,</hi> doth there command a charitable carriage between the ſtrong Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, and the weak. It's true, the leaſt truth of Chriſt is precious, and we are not to deny it; but yet it is not violently to be obtruded, unleſſe where there is eternal damnation inevitable, if that truth be not received. Our Saviour ſpeaks excellently to that, <hi>Matth.</hi> 9.17. <hi>If new wine be put into old bottles, the bottles break</hi>; while men impoſe opinions or practices of leſs conſequence, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a people not prepared, in ſtead of unity, they make many fractions, yet this way of unity hath much infeſted the Church, and eſpecially when men have been in power. They have preſſed unity not ſo much out of love to Chriſt, as thereby to keep up their intereſt: As <hi>Muſculus</hi> obſerveth of the ſouldiers, that would not have Chriſts coat divided, every one hoping thereby to have it all. Thus when <hi>Luther</hi> reformed, nothing was more ordinarily preached by the Papiſts then the <hi>inconſutilis tunica,</hi> the ſeamleſs coat of Chriſt, which made <hi>Luther</hi> call them <hi>Inconſutiliſtae</hi> and <hi>Tunicaſtri.</hi> Now all this endeavour to have ſuch an uniformity, was not out of love to Chriſts Church, but their own pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; and therefore they were afraid of diviſions, leſt they ſhould overthrow their kingdom. Certainly to ſuch auſtere and ſevere impoſers; That of <hi>Auſtin</hi> is often to be re-minded, <hi>Saeviunt illi, qui neſciunt,</hi> &amp;c. let them rage and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute, who know not with what prayers and tears it is given to underſtand, but a little of Gods truth, yet this political way of unity hath been long in the Church, <hi>Aut ſubſcribe, aut diſcede,</hi> was a ſpeech of old in the Church.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <note place="margin">2. By Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</note>2. There is another falſe way of unity extreamly oppoſite to this, ſtrenuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly propugned by the <hi>Socinian,</hi> and that is, <hi>A licentious and unbounded Tolerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of damnable hereſies and Idolatries,</hi> which <hi>Julian</hi> alſo ſtudiouſly promoted, thereby to overthrow the Chriſtian Religion. Now as the former way of unity hath been propugned by thoſe who had power in the Church, ſo this latter by thoſe, who have been the oppreſſed party, for the Scripture decides a middle way between theſe two principles: Hence <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. &amp; <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. The Angels of the Church are commended, when they did not <hi>ſuffer,</hi> or could not <hi>bear</hi> ſuch as publiſhed unſound Doctrine, and therefore thoſe who did ſuffer ſuch, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved: I ſay, the Angels of the Church, for we are treating of Church-peace and liberty, not political and external, which is not comprehended in this Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Certainly, the Apoſtles in their Epiſtles, doe as much, if not more, ſet againſt falſe Doctrines and falſe Teachers, as they do againſt corrupt practices: Hence 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.20. <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> for their blaſphemies and falſe doctrines are by <hi>Paul</hi> delivered up to Satan, and <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.10. we have an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall Rule given, <hi>An heretique after the firſt and ſecond admonition reject.</hi> So that it is very clear, That Church-power and Church-cenſures are to be inflicted on ſuch as obſtinately offend therein; and certainly a boundleſs Toleration of all kinde of hereſies, ſeemeth to be ſo harſh and unſavoury a thing, that even the <hi>Remonſtrants,</hi> who yet cried up a liberty of propheſying, as their great <hi>Diana,</hi> did diſavow this, profeſſing their approbation of that known Rule, It's better living, <hi>ubi nulla licent,</hi> then where <hi>omnia</hi>; and that with this liberty of opinions, there ought to be wayes uſed for the extirpation of hereſies. This licentiouſnes then doth not beget unity, but increaſeth breaches, for it gives way to mens
<pb n="577" facs="tcp:65216:308"/>
corruptions to vent themſelves, and is like the warm Summer to ſnakes and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, which makes them come abroad, when the cold winter kept them in.</p>
            <p>Theſe remedies then being laid aſide, Let us conſider, what are truly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſo, what is the fit oil to be poured into the Churches wounds, ſeeing it is ſo often like that man of <hi>Jericho</hi>; whereas then this breach of unity may be made three wayes, <hi>Of the true Doctrine by hereſie, Of godly Order by ſchiſm,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The true uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting principles. As to true Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</note> and <hi>Of Chriſtian love by wrath and contentions in outward matters.</hi> Let us ſee what are the peculiar Remedies; for what is proper to one is not to another, and as for the way of unity in Doctrine, theſe are uniting and cloſing principles.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. <hi>So farre as there is an agreement in judgement, to cloſe heartily, and imbrace one another in that.</hi> It's a mercy that the difference is not in the very fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals and vitals of Religion, ſeeing therefore there are common opinions and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, wherein the godly do agree, let that unity be nouriſhed, this will be a means to produce further union. This Rule the Apoſtle giveth, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.15, 16. <hi>Whither we have attained, let us walk by the ſame Rule, and if any man be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe minded, God ſhall reveal this to them.</hi> It's a great frowardneſs in the rigid <hi>Lutherans,</hi> that they will not own the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> as brethren, though there may be a <hi>reconciliation in fundamentals,</hi> as <hi>Pareus</hi> pleadeth. So farre then as men do retain Chriſt, and <hi>fundamental truth with an humble godly diſpoſition, deſiring to be further informed.</hi> Let not the want of what they ſhould have, make thee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe the good things they have.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. <hi>Let private Chriſtians highly eſteem and ſubmit to thoſe godly and faithfull Paſtors, God hath ſet over them.</hi> For commonly there begins the breach, when they begin to be offended at them. It was ſome miſtake about what Chriſt preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that made ſo many Diſciples quite forſake him, it was <hi>durus Sermo,</hi> an hard ſpeech, they ſaid, and would not ſeek to be further informed, when men will not own that publick office God hath appointed, then they wander into by-paths: Therefore <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.12, 13<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> You ſee a two-fold end of the Miniſters of Chriſt; the one is, <hi>To keep them from being carried about with every winde of Doctrine.</hi> The other, for a <hi>ſpiritual edification, till we all come in the unity of faith</hi>; So that a due and fit obedience and acknowledgement of them, would in a ſpecial manner prevent diviſions.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. <hi>Get a pitifull and compaſſionate ſpirit to thoſe that go aſtray.</hi> We are indeed to have zeal, and an holy impatience in the things of God, yet this is to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with pity, <hi>Of ſome have compaſſion, making a difference,</hi> ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Jude.</hi> Certainly, when we ſhall conſider, how prone it is for men to receive errour for truth; How naturally blinde and oppoſite the minde of a man is to the revealed truths of God, and how that it's the Spirit of God that leads thee into truth, That it's God only who keeps thee from the hereſies and errours that others are carried aſide with. Theſe things will greatly move thee to ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der bowels.</p>

            <p>TO prevent or heal any breach that may be made in doctrine by errour, we have given ſome Remedies, and there are more remaining:</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> As firſt, <hi>Candidly and truly to lay down or report the opinions of others that do diſſent from us</hi>; There is nothing hath made the gap wider, and more raked into the ſores of the Church then ſuch a malevolent and ill diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, to pervert the opinions of others, to make them hold ſuch monſtrous things, as they do with all their hearts deteſt; It was thought that the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> therefore was moved to write that Epiſtle for works as well as faith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſome did miſunderſtand <hi>Pauls</hi> writings, as if he had taught Faith onely was enough to ſave, though it was not accompanied with an holy life. How of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten was Chriſt and the Apoſtles traduced for preaching ſuch things that they never taught, and all this was done by their malicious enemies to make them more odious, and to bring greater danger upon them; And do not the Papiſts to this day repreſent the Proteſtants as if they were the moſt damnable and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous heret<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ques that ever were? But if it be not lawful in civil matters to bear falſe witneſſe againſt another, much leſs in Religious and doctrinal mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; whether therefore it be by writing, preaching, report, or any other way Gods Word and Conſcience requireth of us, that we are to repreſent the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of others truly and really, not put a ſence of our own upon them, and then fight with that, this is not the way to bring the ſtraying Sheep back again, this will never reduce to unity, for the party diſſenting will preſently ſee, that truth is not ſought for but victory, That the end of diſſenters is not to bring him to the knowledge of truth, but to diſgrace and defame him, and this will never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert, Therefore that is neceſſary in all diſputations to ſtate the controverſie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, for that is like the firſt concoction, which if it miſcarry is not mended af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, men may write voluminous books, and bring multitude of arguments to no purpoſe, if the true ſtate of the controverſie be not laid down: To know therefore the true and proper diſtance is the only way at laſt to unite, as the beſt way to recover out of a diſeaſe is to be truly informed what it is.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> A ſecond Remedy, uniting in matters of doctrine is, not <hi>to impoſe ſuch Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and inferences upon the doctrine maintained by diſſentients, that are not the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and genuine effect thereof, To caſt that upon them as their doctrine which is but
<pb n="579" facs="tcp:65216:309"/>
our inference that we may make through ignorance or any other diſtemper, is not fair, eſpecially when they do with their whole ſoul abhor ſuch Concluſions</hi>; There were ſome Spiders that would ſuck poiſon from thoſe ſweet herbs the Apoſtle had planted, becauſe he ſhewed that where ſin had abounded grace did much more; Therefore ſome forced this conſequence upon the Apoſtles doctrine, <hi>Let us ſin that grace may abound,</hi> Rom. 6.1. And thus the Papiſts deal with us, and <hi>Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans</hi> alſo, how often do they charge this hideous calumny and conſequence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Proteſtants doctrine, as if we made God the authour of ſin? whereas we uſe but the Scripture words and ſuch expreſſions, no, nor ſuch harſh ones nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as ſome of their own Popiſh Writers do, only it's truth in them but blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy in us; Indeed what is the evident and plain Conſequence of a Doctrine, that is to be accounted of as the doctrine it ſelf; As whatſoever is a clear genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine conſequence from Scripture is Scripture, but not every conſequence, We are apt to deduce, Thus it is here, what is evidently a conſequence from any Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, we may charge it upon the doctrine, but then we muſt be ſure it's the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and natural childe, not a baſtard, that it is the true iſſue not ſuppoſitions.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> 3. <hi>Whatſoever truth God may have indeed made known to us, or if in our perſwaſion only, we are to be very careful how we publiſh it</hi>; This hath been conſtant fire in the Church of God when men either have, or in perſwaſion only, ſome doctrine different from the current way of the Church at that time; Now it's a very hard thing thus to be with childe as it were, and not to be full of pain till we have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered it to the world; Why is an obſtinate broacher of damnable doctrines called an heretitk but becauſe he chooſeth his own way? He invents and exco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitates a doctrine of his own, therefore compared to theeves and robbers, that go not in by the door but climbe up ſome other way; Now ſuch qualifications as theſe are neceſſary,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>To queſtion and examine thy own ſpirit,</hi> not preſently to believe thy own heart; This is a firebrand in the Church, when men have no modeſt doubtings and queſtionings of their own ignorance and proneſſe to erre even in that thing they are ſo confident of; how modeſtly doth the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeak 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. when he determined the caſe about marriage, <hi>I think alſo I have the Spirit of God,</hi> and he diſtinguiſheth between that which he had as an expreſſe command from the Lord, and what he was inwardly directed unto, whereſoever the Spirit of God leadeth into all truth, there he doth likewiſe into all humility; Thus <hi>Luthers Tunè ſolus ſapis es</hi> is famouſly known, though the Papiſts charge him falſly with contempt of all others.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Before we publiſh it to the world to communicate our thoughts to thoſe that are able, wiſe, and learned in the Church of God, who have the Spirit of God and his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction as well as we; Paul</hi> though called immediately by Chriſt, yet went up to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to confer with the chief pillars there, and though he was thus mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculouſly converted, yet he muſt go to <hi>Ananias</hi> to be further directed, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.14. thoſe that had extraordinary gifts yet were to ſubmit themſelves to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, <hi>The Spirit of the Prophets is ſubject to the Prophets,</hi> which is interpreted two waies, and both pertinently to my matter:</p>

known by the book of nature, relatively only by the Scripture and revelation. By the creatures we only can come to know that there is a God, maker of all things, but that this God is diſtinguiſhed by three perſonal proprieties, is not matter of inveſtigation, but faith only: Therefore howſoever ſome learned men have endeavoured to illuſtrate this myſtery from humane Philoſophers, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the <hi>Platoniſts,</hi> who ſpeak of <hi>three principles,</hi> the <hi>Minde,</hi> the <hi>Word,</hi> and the <hi>Spirit,</hi> yet they made theſe three diſtinct Eſſences, and cannot be applied to this myſtery, though, it may be, they had theſe confuſed notions from ſome ancient tradition of the <hi>Hebrews.</hi> In the Old Teſtament this myſtery was believed and received; Therefore good and ſolid Arguments may be fetcht thence to prove this Doctrine, yet in the New Teſtament, Chriſt, who is the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>the Word,</hi> doth more expreſly reveal it; ſo that in thoſe who do believe the Scriptures, yet obſtinately and blaſphemouſly not only deny, but deride the Doctrine of the Trinity, it is a very high ſin and blaſphemy.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Although the Scripture reveal unto us three Perſons,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. There is not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding but one God.</note> 
               <hi>yet this is not to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, as if thereby were conſtituted many Gods.</hi> There were Hereticks called <hi>Tritheita,</hi> that made three Gods of theſe three Perſons. Now this is clear, that though the Scripture acknowledge three Perſons, yet it doth as plainly declare, <hi>there is but one God</hi>; Therefore though every Perſon be God, yet there are not three Gods: Therefore when the Father is called the alone God, this is not to exclude the other Perſons from being God, but any other made god. The Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſh Idols were not gods, nor will God give this glory to any creature.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>This Doctrine therefore of the Trinity is purely an object of faith,</hi>
               <note place="margin">3. This Doctrine of the Trinity is an object of faith, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</note> 
               <hi>and cannot be demonſtrated by reaſon.</hi> The Schoolmen do well declare, That the ſame things in Divinity may be demonſtrated by reaſon, and believed by faith, as that there is a God; this may be known both wayes; ſo that though faith and ſcience can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have the ſame formal motive, yet they may be converſant about the ſame object, we know there is a God by demonſtrations of reaſon, we believe by authority and teſtimony from Scripture: But now this truth about the Perſons in the Divine Nature, is only to be believed: It cannot be demonſtrated by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Indeed when once this revelation is made, then it is not hard to finde out ſuch reaſons and conſequences grounded on Scripture, that may ſerve to anſwer all the objections of any adverſaries; for nothing revealed to be believed, is contrary to reaſon, though it may be above it. Therefore when Scripture hath laid the foundation, then reaſon may make a ſuperſtruction, yet we muſt take this Caution; although reaſon be allowed to be a ſervant to faith, we muſt look ſhe grow not imperious, as <hi>Hagar</hi> to <hi>Sarah,</hi> for then we are to caſt her out of doors, then the Rule is, <hi>Mulier iſta ratio, taceat in Eccleſiâ.</hi> This Doctrine therefore is to be adored with humble believing, and not to be ſearcht into by curious or furious raſhneſs; and certainly the devil is very ready to tempt in this point, ſometimes he prevaileth to ſeduce in this point, as appeareth by the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of <hi>Arians</hi> of old, and <hi>Socinians</hi> of late, ſometimes he cannot ſeduce, yet he doth ſhake and diſturb the mindes of the godly exceedingly by ſuggeſtions; ſo that their temptations about dogmatical faith, ſometimes are as grievous, as about juſtifying faith. But now although we have a two fold light, the light of reaſon, and the light of faith, and the latter ought to correct &amp; direct the former, yet ſuch is our corruption, that we make the light of reaſon to correct the light of faith, as if we ſhould make the Sun to borrow its light from the ſtars. But theſe two lights are as ſuperiour and inferior; ſo that although nothing can be falſe by the light of reaſon, which is true by the light of faith, yet the light of faith com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends many things, which the light of reaſon cannot, as nothing can be falſe to ſenſe, and true to reaſon, yet reaſon can comprehend many things which ſenſe cannot: Therefore when the light of the Moon which is reaſon is very dim and ſtaggering, let the light of faith like that of the Sun fully enlighten and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm thee.</p>

            <p n="1">1. <hi>In that he is called the Father, and Chriſt the Sonne, it's implied, that he is the firſt Perſon in the holy Trinity, and the Sonne the ſecond,</hi> only when he is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the firſt, you <hi>muſt not underſtand it in dignity and perfection,</hi> for the Father hath no abſolute perfection, which the Sonne hath not; for ſeeing both have the nature of God, therefore one cannot have greater perfection then another; The Father is not more wiſe, more powerfull, more holy then the Son; Nor is he the firſt Perſon in reſpect of <hi>duration,</hi> as if the Father was God before the Son; for ſeeing he was from all eternity Father, therefore he had alſo this Son from eternity, as the Sun was never without its beams. Indeed the Orthodox do well deride, and juſtly, the <hi>Socinians,</hi> That whereas they confeſs the Father from all eternity, and the Son, a made, or conſtituted God in time, that they thereby introduce <hi>an old God, and a young God,</hi> not indeed as theſe words de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note infirmities, but as old is taken for ancient, and young for that which is new. And certainly, if there was a time, when Chriſt was not the Son of God, then he became to be ſo in time, but he is called the <hi>firſt Perſon in order</hi>: for ſo the Scripture repreſents an order to our conceptions in this glorious myſtery, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by the form of Baptiſm, whereby we are baptized firſt into the name of the <hi>Father,</hi> and then of the <hi>Sonne</hi>; The Father then is the firſt Perſon, and the Son the ſecond, not in reſpect of dignity or duration, but order.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When God the Father is ſaid to be the Father of Chriſt his Son, <hi>It is not in a large ſenſe, as he is called Father ſometimes, but in a proper, peculiar and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicable ſenſe</hi>; for therefore he is called <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>the only begotten Son of God,</hi> and indeed we ſee plainly the unity of the Father ſeparated from the unity of believers in this Text, <hi>That they may be one, as thou in me, and I in thee,</hi> for God is called the Father of all men. To which purpoſe the Apoſtle alledgeth that of the Poet, <hi>We are his off-ſpring,</hi> Act. 17.27. Thus alſo he is called the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Believers in reſpect of Adoption, for ſo our Saviour, <hi>Joh.</hi> 20.17. <hi>I aſcend to my Father and your Father,</hi> but he is called the Father in reſpect of a true and proper <hi>generation</hi> of his Son; as is more to be ſhewed. The <hi>Socinians</hi> would have him called the <hi>Son of God,</hi> partly, becauſe of that extraordinary conception and birth, partly, becauſe of the conſtituting and ſanctifying of him to the Office of a Prieſt, and partly, but principally, becauſe of his Reſurrection and Exaltation to that great power and dominion which now he hath, but theſe things are only declarative and conſequential to that eternal generation, whereby indeed he is the Son of God properly, and thus the Jews underſtood it, when they accuſed him for blaſphemy, becauſe by ſaying, <hi>He was the Son of God, he thereby made himſelf God,</hi> which our Saviour <hi>doth not deny or refuſe</hi>; but proveth it more firmly.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, In that he is called the <hi>Father,</hi> it is thereby implyed, <hi>That he is the fountain and original of divine being to the Son.</hi> Thus <hi>John</hi> 5.26. <hi>As the Father hath life in himſelf, ſo hath he given the Son, to have life in himſelf.</hi> To have life in himſelf is only proper to God: Now as the Father hath it, ſo alſo hath the Son, but he hath it by donation, or communication from the Father: In this
<pb n="585" facs="tcp:65216:312"/>
ſenſe it is, that Chriſt ſaith, <hi>He ſpeaketh nothing of himſelf, but as he heareth of the Father,</hi> ſtill reducing all things unto him, not that the Divine Nature is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, but the ſecond Perſon, who hath the Divine Nature.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> Secondly, <hi>The property of the Son is, to be begotten of the Father.</hi> And herein lieth the true proper difference of thoſe two Perſons, The Father is of himſelf not begotten, the Son is of the Father and begotten: Now this doth imply, that Chriſt hath not his being by creation, as <hi>Adam</hi> had, and Angels, who therefore are called <hi>The ſons of God,</hi> but truly and really by generation, for ſo the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture appropriates this to him, <hi>That he is the only begotten Son of God</hi>; only you are not to meaſure this ſpiritual and eternal generation with that of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but to abſtract it from all ſuch humane imperfections; and therefore though it be truly a generation, yet it's not of the ſame univocal nature with that of creatures: So that as God is not in a predicament, neither is there the ſame univocal being to God, and the creature: Thus it is alſo in this generation. Let us not therefore judge of this myſtery by examples and inſtances from the creature; for as the nature of God is incomprehenſible, ſo alſo is this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>

            <p>IN theſe words we have the nature and quality of the godly mans Union de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared. 1. That it is an <hi>holy</hi> and <hi>godly <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> they are one in Chriſt, not in the devil or ſin as wicked men are. 2. It's not a <hi>bodily</hi> Union and viſible, but ſpiritual and inviſible, becauſe it's an Unity in the Father and the Son. 3. It's not <hi>abſolutely</hi> and <hi>adequately equall</hi> to the Union between the Father and Son, for our Saviour doth plainly ſeparate and make a difference, he ſaid not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, As thou Father art in us and we in thee, but <hi>in me,</hi> and <hi>I in thee,</hi> diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing himſelf thereby in a tranſcendent way from the creature, ſo neither in this place doth he ſay, <hi>That they may be one with us</hi> (though that alſo is true in a myſtical ſence, Chriſt the Head and the Church his body, being one in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect) becauſe that might imply Unity of nature and eſſence, but one in us: Now for all believers <hi>to be one</hi> in the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Son,</hi> may admit of a twofold Expoſition: 1.

            <p n="2">2. <hi>There muſt be an unition,</hi> as <hi>Cameron</hi> well obſerveth,<note place="margin">II. There muſt be an unition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there can be an union.</note> 
               <hi>before there can be an union, a Communication before a Communion</hi>; Unition is to be conceived <hi>effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently</hi> as the work of Gods Spirit, joyning the believer to Chriſt, and union is to be conceived formally, The joyning it ſelf of the perſons together; Now there is <hi>ſomething on Gods part uniting, and ſomething on ours</hi>; On Gods part, that is, the <hi>ſpirit of God,</hi> Eph. 2.8. the Jew and Gentile have through Chriſt acceſſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Father <hi>through one spirit,</hi> So that as it's the Spirit that ſanctifieth, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that worketh mightily in beleevers, the Spirit that ſealeth; Thus it is alſo the Spirit that unites to Chriſt, for of our ſelves we are aliens from God, we all lie diſſipated in ruine, but it's the Spirit of God that quickens us, and engraft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us into Chriſt; As the Spirit on Gods part, ſo Faith on our part, <hi>Eph</hi> 3.15. Thus <hi>Chriſt dwels by Faith in our hearts,</hi> and it's by Faith we are ingrafted into the Olive-Tree, therefore that is called <hi>eating of his Fleſh, and drinking of his bloud,</hi> whereby we are made one with Chriſt our head; We then may eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude all men living in their natural condition without the Spirit of God have nothing of this Unity, They muſt needs wither and periſh in their ſins.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>We may conceive of a natural union with Chriſt and a ſupernatural</hi>;<note place="margin">III. There is a naturall union with Chriſt and a ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural.</note> A natural union all men have, in that he took mans nature and not Angels upon him, So that in this reſpect all men though never ſo wicked yet agree with him in his humane nature, and thouſands are damned, though Chriſt took mans nature upon him; The other union is <hi>ſupernaturall,</hi> for as Chriſt though man yet was conceived in a ſupernatural way by the holy Ghoſt, So all thoſe who are myſtically united to Chriſt are in a ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral way changed by the holy Ghoſt, and thereby joyned to Chriſt, for it's the Spirit of Chriſt as well as of God the Father that doth thus unite us to him; We cannot then take any comfort ſimply in this, that Chriſt was made man, <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe</hi> we have a <hi>ſpiritual <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion with him,</hi> as well as a naturall; Therefore the Apoſtle excellently to this purpoſe urging Chriſts Incarnation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.11, 14. doth not preſs abſolutely his being made man but ſo as thereby to help not all men but ſuch as are his brethren, all men are not Chriſts brethren but ſuch as by
<pb n="588" facs="tcp:65216:314"/>
faith are made one with him; Both he that ſanctifieth, and they who are ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied are all of one, that is, of one <hi>Adam,</hi> of one root, as it is generally expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but though other men be of that one root, as well as ſuch as are ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet the Apoſtle limits it to ſuch only that are ſanctified, and from thence draweth that comfortable inference, <hi>Chriſt is not aſhamed to call them brethren</hi>; and <hi>v.</hi> 14. becauſe the Children are partakers of fleſh and bloud, he alſo himſelf took part of the ſame, ſo that it's plain by theſe Texts, No man can ſimply take comfort in this, that Chriſt became a man, That he is of the ſame humane nature with Chriſt, for it's only to the children, only to ſuch as are ſanctified, that his Incarnation is advantagious.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">IV. This union is wholly ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual.</note>Hence 4. <hi>This union is wholly spiritual and inviſible,</hi> Chriſt is the head and we the body, Chriſt the husband and we the wife, but all this is after a ſpirituall and myſterious manner; The ligaments are ſpiritual, inſomuch that this is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter felt experimentally then palpably expreſſed; Therefore to carnal and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral men it's wholly a paradox, They cannot imagine what it is, Even as ſpiritual and immaterial objects cannot be diſcerned by the eye, <hi>No man hath ſeen God at any time,</hi> So neither can this ſpiritual union be naturally perceived, if we ſhould preach all our life time upon it, a natural man would never underſtand one iota or tittle about it, Therefore when the Apoſtle ſpeaking of the union between man and wife, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.32. therby repreſenting the union of Chriſt and his Church, addeth, <hi>This is a great myſtery, but I ſpeak concerning Chriſt and his Church</hi>; Oh pray therefore that thou maiſt experimentally feel this union with Chriſt; That ſomething within may cloſe with this, and thou maiſt be able to ſay, O Lord, though I reade it in no Book, hear it in no Sermon, yet my own heart can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern it.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <note place="margin">V. It's alſo reall.</note>5. <hi>Though this union be ſpiritual, yet for all that it is reall,</hi> it's not imaginary and a meer fancy, but as Chriſt is a real Chriſt, God a real God, faith a real grace, ſo real is our union with theſe, and therefore the effects of this union are altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther real, ſuch as juſtification, and a <hi>vivifical influence</hi> from Chriſt into us; He is not an head in vain, he is not a vine in fancy and imagination, Therefore he ſaith, <hi>I am the true Vine,</hi> Joh. 15.1. not corporally but ſpiritually, yet the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſheweth, that a natural vine doth not ſo truly nouriſh its branches as Chriſt doth his people; Hence <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. he ſaith, <hi>My fleſh is meat indeed, and my bloud is drink indeed</hi>; Not as the <hi>Capernaits</hi> underſtood it, but in a ſpiritual reality, and certainly the wonderful effects of Chriſts union with the godly do demonſtrate the reality of it; There is love of God, an heavenly life, ſupport in all Exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are the bleſſed effects of this glorious union.</p>

The Scripture ſaith, ſuch are afar off, and indeed there is a great gulf between them and heaven, God is an Enemy to them, and they to God, till they be made one in Chriſt; Alas, they can no more approach to God in any duty, then ſtubble can endure before the fire; This made <hi>Paul</hi> Gal. 2. ſay, <hi>he no longer lived but Chriſt in him</hi>; And again, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. <hi>he would not be found in his own Righteouſneſſe, but in Chriſt</hi>; And <hi>Col.</hi> 2. <hi>Ye are compleat in him: It pleaſed the Father that in him all fulneſs ſhould dwell.</hi> 1 Cor. 1. <hi>God hath made Chriſt wiſedom, rigteouſneſſe, and redemption</hi>; So that Chriſt hath the preheminence in all things, <hi>he is Alpha and Omega, he is all in all</hi>; Who art thou then poor, wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and miſerble ſinner that dareſt abide an hour, a day in thy natural condition without Chriſt?

This cannot be no more then that Chriſt ſhould be forſaken, for this union makes thee and Chriſt one myſticall perſon, ſo that by this union there is a communion of all Chriſts good things to thee, and of thy evil things to him, thy ſins were laid on him, he became ſinne for thee, and thy evils are felt by him; <hi>Saul, Saul, why perſecuteſt thou me?</hi> ſaith Chriſt from heaven, <hi>Act.</hi> 9.4. yea, the Church is called Chriſt, becauſe of this intimate union, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And anſwers, The world is here taken for the world not of reprobates, but predeſtinated ones, in which ſenſe the world is taken (he ſaith) in theſe two places, <hi>I came not to judge, but to ſave the world,</hi> John 3.17. <hi>And God was in Chriſt reconciling the world to himſelf,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.19.

            <p>Firſt, <hi>That though our Saviour preſſe <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of believers, as a ſign of his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and a means to winne others to the Faith, yet <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity ſimply as ſo, is not an inſeparable note of the true Church.</hi> The Papiſts indeed they profeſſedly maintain this, That where we ſee a Church in it's members all united to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and that under one viſible Head and Paſtour, there we are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude is the true Church; and on the contrary, when we ſee diviſions and multiplicities of Sects and Opinions, as (they ſay) there are almoſt an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred amongſt the Proteſtants, there cannot be any true Church; And indeed they have no fairer way to intangle men, and to fill the hearts of people with prejudices againſt the truth, then becauſe of the many opinions that are amongſt us. But to this we anſwer theſe things,</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity, as <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity without true Doctrine, cannot be any diſtinctive Note of a true Church.</hi> A whole Church, as that of <hi>Iſrael,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Papiſt anſwered. Unity without true Doctrine no note of a true Church. The Papiſt no ſuch cauſe to boaſt of Unity.</note> may be univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally corrupted, ſo that neither the Worſhip or Truths of God were in any viſible way received, and yet in this univerſall corruption, they were all as one man. Thus the Jewes and Turks they have wonderfull unity amongſt themſelves; yet who will conclude the Truth is amongſt them? Although the Heathens had multiplicity of Gods and religious wayes, yet the Jewes are at great conſent in the main things amongſt themſelves. It is neceſſary therefore that to Unity there muſt be joyned true and ſound Doctrine.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond place, We ſay, <hi>There is no ſuch cauſe for Papiſts to boaſt of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity amongst themſelves: For our Divines doe abundantly ſhew, That theſe Philiſtims doe not onely fight againſt the Iſraelites, but even one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> Their Swords are often ſet one againſt another, witneſſe the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> and <hi>Dominicans,</hi> and that in great controverſal points; ſo alſo between <hi>Thomiſts</hi> and <hi>Scotiſts.</hi> Now to this <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hath theſe anſwers.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That their differences are not in ſubſtantial things, they are only in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary points. But</p>
            <p>Firſt, So we ſay, The Proteſtants truly ſo called <hi>(for we cannot tell how to call the Socinians Chriſtians)</hi> do agree in Fundamentals; ſo that although there be great diſputes in their <hi>circa fundamentalia,</hi> yet the foundation it ſelf they fall not upon.</p>
            <p>Secondly, We ſay, They have diſſented in Fundamentals; for is not that a principle of Religion with them, Whether the Pope be above the Councell?
<pb n="592" facs="tcp:65216:316"/>
And yet there have been hot differences amongſt them in this point; And therefore ſome have aſſerted, The Pope may be depoſed by the Councel, and deputed for an Heretique: Now certainly with them, either the Pope, or a Councell is the generall Head of the Church, and it's of the neceſſity of ſalvation to be in obedience to ſuch an Head, yet they cannot agree who that is.</p>
            <p>In the next place, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hath this evaſion, If (ſaith he) our Church have any diviſions, they ariſe from the meer malice of the Devil, not for want of a remedy to keep the unity, for we have a viſible Judge to determine all controverſies, whereas (ſaith he) among Proteſtants their differences do ariſe from the very <hi>Genius</hi> of their Doctrine, becauſe they hold no viſible effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious remedy to ſuch contentions.</p>
            <p>But to this alſo its anſwered eaſily, That all the differences amongſt the people of God, come from the Devil without, and corruptions within. The Devil is not wholly conquered, nor are our corruptions altogether vanquiſhed, and therefore it cannot be, but that breaches and wounds will ſometimes be made.</p>
            <p>Yet in the ſecond place, We have a more ſure and efficacious remedy to compoſe all differences, then they have; for they indeed alledge the Pope, or a Councell, as a viſible Judge to end all controverſies; but theſe being men are ſubject to ignorance and paſſions, and ſo cannot perform the Office of an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible viſible Church, becauſe not ſufficiently qualified thereunto. Again, They have not <hi>de facto,</hi> ſilenced all thoſe debates that are amongſt them. Some of the fore-mentioned Diſputes are as fervent as ever. Neither hath the Pope yet interpoſed to decide, Whether thoſe Doctrines about <hi>ſcientia media,</hi> and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute predefinitions with the dependent controverſies thereon, be true on the <hi>Dominicans</hi> ſide, or their adverſaries?</p>
            <p>Therefore thirdly, We hold, <hi>The Scriptures to be the infallible and uner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Rule, and therefore have a proper and ſufficient means to end all contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies.</hi> And although it be ſaid, That many differences ariſe about the ſenſe of the Scripture, therefore that cannot be a Judge, but the Church. We re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, That many controverſies alſo may ariſe about the Church, the Authority of it, and it's infallibility, and therefore they who acknowledge the Scripture the only adequate Rule of faith, do thereby confeſſe a powerfull remedy to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move all differences.</p>
            <p>Further, <hi>That <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity is not,</hi> de facto, <hi>alwayes a note of the Church,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, <hi>from the oppoſition of Satan againſt the peace and quietneſſe of it:</hi> And therefore as it is in matter of practice, peace and quietneſſe is not alwayes a ſigne of a good conſcience; for our Saviour ſaith, <hi>The Devil keepeth all things quiet, while he ruleth,</hi> Luke 11.21. Thus it is alſo in reſpect of Churches, many times a falſe ſuperſtitious Church hath more plenty and eaſe, then a true one, becauſe the Devil will not diſturb his own; but where the Kingdome of Chriſt is, there the Devil doth alſo deſire to erect his Throne. Thus when the good ſeed was ſowne, the Devil ſuperſeminated his Tares. In a wilderneſſe, or a place of weeds, he would not have been ſo dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent: Therefore breaches and diviſions, becauſe they are a kinde or part of afflictions and troubles, may ſooner accompany the true Church, then outward unity and proſperity.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, We grant, <hi>That if the Church of God were fully perfected, both in reſpect of knowledge and holineſſe, it would alwayes have unity:</hi> As we ſee in Heaven, where there is no difference at all, but becauſe we know in part, we are godly in part, therefore theſe breaches may be made upon us; Diſcord then and diviſion may be in an imperfect Church, but not a perfect: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Saviours prayer will have it's accompliſhment only in Heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="593" facs="tcp:65216:316"/>Let us now proceed to ſhew, <hi>Why unity is ſuch an attractive and a divine load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone to bring others unto the faith.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Why Unity is an attractive loadſtone to bring others unto the faith.</note> And</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, <hi>Becauſe it's ingraffed in a man, to cleave to ſuch a way of Religion, as will abide and continue. Have any Nations changed their god,</hi> ſaith the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> 2.11? You ſee the Stateſ-man argued on this ground, that they ſhould not oppoſe the Chriſtians, for <hi>if that Religion were of God, it would ſtand,</hi> Act. 5.39. Now this is a clear axiom, confirmed alſo by our Saviour, <hi>That no Kingdome divided againſt it ſelf can ſtand,</hi> Luk. 11.17. By that Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument our Saviour proveth, he could not caſt out Devils by the help of the Devils, for then the Devil would overthrow his owne Kingdome. Diviſions then and differences muſt needs be a ſtumbling block; for who will go into that houſe, which hath it's chiefeſt parts falling from one another? Who would venture in that ſhip, which is full of leaks? Do not all ſay, let them alone, they will deſtroy one another, there needs no outward force to ruine them, they will conſume themſelves at laſt?</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, <hi>Diviſions muſt needs put a ſtop to the progreſſe of truth, becauſe God is acknowledged by all to be a God of peace and of order.</hi> The Apoſtle uſeth this conſideration to reſtrain thoſe confuſions and diſorderly cuſtoms the Chriſtians had in their publique Aſſemblies, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. If then God be a God of peace and order, how can any man think his truth and people are there, where all diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and confuſion is? It's <hi>Babel,</hi> and not <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that in the building there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of men were ſo confounded, that they underſtood not the language of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Jam.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Where envying and ſtrife is, there is confuſion and every evil work.</hi> Now every one is apt to argue, certainly if this were the way of God, if theſe were the people of God, there would not be ſuch confuſion amongſt them; God that made this great world in ſuch excellent order, would much more make his Church, his choiceſt plant more beautifull.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, <hi>Diviſions do retard the Goſpel, Becauſe men who have any wayes heard of the holy Ghoſt, that he alone it is, who leadeth into all truth, will quickly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that this Spirit cannot be againſt it ſelf.</hi> And this is the more obſervable, becauſe every party doth pretend to the Spirit of God, which is the cauſe of that command, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.1. <hi>To try the Spirits, and not to believe every ſpirit,</hi> that is, Doctrine pretended to be of the Spirit; if then all parties do plead Gods Spirit, and it's teaching, they are the more confirmed in their unbelief, when they ſee contrary ſpirits, of contrary doctrines, and that with great zeal condemning each other. Thus we have ſhewed you, what a world of hurt, diviſions amongſt the godly do; inſomuch that it is a wonderfull work of God, that any are brought off from their former vain converſation, when the ſpirit of diviſion hath ſo ſadly reigned amongſt us. Wonder not if converſion be ſo rare a thing, if ſo few come in cordially to own Chriſt, for ſad offences are made by theſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences; and ſuch as cauſe them, do as much as in them lieth, that never any more one ſoul may be brought into Heavens way.</p>
            <p>In the next place, <hi>Let us conſider, what are thoſe proper ſins,</hi>
               <note place="margin">What thoſe proper ſins are that diviſions amongſt the godly are apt to breed in the world.</note> 
               <hi>that diviſions amongst the godly, are apt to breed in the world.</hi> And</p>
            <p>The firſt is <hi>Atheiſm and irreligion,</hi> to be perſwaded that there is no ſuch thing as a true Religion, but that ſuch things are the fancies and imaginations of men. No doubt but thouſands are confirmed in their atheiſtical way; they will believe there is no God at all, no Religion better then another, for they ſee the world cannot agree about it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>It breedeth ſtiffneſſe and obſtinacy in their former erroneous and ſuperſtitious wayes.</hi> No doubt this keepeth multitudes hardened in their Popiſh wayes, and many ſilly people they will keep to their old way; and why? becauſe there are ſo many wayes, and every one hath a Religion for himſelf, therefore they will ſtay where they are, they know not whither they may ſtumble at laſt; They
<pb n="594" facs="tcp:65216:317"/>
think to go out of their old wayes, is to go out of their old wits likewiſe at the ſame time.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, <hi>It's apt to breed fickleneſſe, inconſtancy and ſcepticiſm.</hi> Are there not many called <hi>Seekers,</hi> that think there is now no Church ſince the Apoſtles times, and therefore are in their ſouls, what <hi>Cain</hi> in his body, <hi>vagabonds about the earth?</hi> and whence is all this? The bitter root of this was diverſity of opinions, which they entertain one after another, which at laſt makes them quite without any bottom at all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of Inſtruction,</hi> to every Chriſtian again and again, to take heed of cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing diviſions in the Church of God; Be afraid by any opinion or practice to make an unneceſſary rent; for doeſt thou not as much as lieth in thee to hinder all others from coming to the Kingdom of Heaven? Will not this be a ſad ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation, when men damned in hell ſhall plead, Lord, I was coming, even I was hopefully inclining to ſuch things, but this man and that man by his diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſtopt me, he made me a proſelyte to ſome pernicious way, while I was going to Chriſt? Had not ſuch a man been in the way, I had never been ſeduced? Certainly, if our Saviour pronounce ſuch a woe to thoſe by whom offences come, how ſore will it fall upon thoſe who make theſe offences in the higheſt nature?</p>

               <hi>

            </epigraph>
            <p>WE are treating on the Conſequent of Unity amongſt the Godly, <hi>That the world may beleeve,</hi> which belief hath been already conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red relatively, as a product of Unity: We ſhall now take notice of it <hi>abſolutely</hi> as it is in its own ſelf; <hi>It is believing that the Father hath ſent Chriſt into the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We formerly ſpake of believing in its <hi>specificall</hi> nature, as it juſtifieth by laying hold on Chriſt.</p>
            <p>We ſhall here ſpeak of it in its generall Nature, becauſe this believing is common both to the Hypocrite and the ſound Chriſtian; For of that world which doth beleeve, all do not believe in a ſaving manner, So that although none who believe Chriſt ſent into the world, ought to ſtay in that generall, but particularly to improve Chriſt, that he may be ſent for their good, yet becauſe the expreſſion is here general, I ſhall conſider of it as a generall.</p>
            <p>For whereas in the former Verſe the Object of Faith was made Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>Ens incomplexum,</hi> Here it is a Propoſition, though that onely is the <hi>Objectum quo</hi> and not <hi>quod,</hi> upon which our Faith is ultimately termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated.</p>
            <p>Obſ.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Obſerv.</hi> That the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving of Chriſt being ſent unto the world is the foundation of our converſion unto God.</note> 
               <hi>That the Believing of Chriſt being ſent unto the world is the foundation and firſt principle of our Converſion unto God</hi>; Though men have never ſo much underſtanding in other Religious Points, as that Scribe ſpoken of, <hi>Mark</hi> 12. though not farre off, yet <hi>they are not in the Kingdome of Heaven,</hi> until they believe in Chriſt as ſent by the Father to be our Mediatour; That as the Apoſtle <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11. makes it a Fundamentall requiſite in every one to believe <hi>that God is,</hi> no leſſe is required to believe that Chriſt is; Therefore 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. Jeſus Chriſt is called <hi>the Foundation,</hi> and by ſome made the adequate object of Divinity, becauſe every thing conſidered there, doth either directly or reductively leade unto Chriſt; So that I ſhall not ſpeak of that peculiar Act of Faith applying Chriſt, but that generall act whereby we know and aſſent firmly and immovably, <hi>That there was a Chriſt, God and man, who was ſent by the Father to redeem and ſave ſinners</hi>; For though all be thought to believe this, yet the right and powerfull aſſenting to it is the foundation both of all holineſſe and conſolation, but ere we ſpeak of the Nature of it ſome diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are to be premiſed,</p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Diſtinct. </seg>I</label> As Firſt, <hi>That Faith is ſometimes taken for the Object,</hi> the Faith <hi>quae credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur,</hi> The <hi>Doctrine beleeved,</hi> and ſometimes for the <hi>Grace of Faith quâ credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur,</hi> whereby we do believe <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2.5. <hi>To be eſtabliſhed in the Faith,</hi> that is, in the Doctrine; So ſome are ſaid to erre, to deny, or depart from the Faith, that is, the Doctrine; But commonly it is uſed for the <hi>gracious actings of the Soul</hi> towards thoſe Objects, only it's good to obſerve this diſtinction, becauſe ſome places are brought to prove Apoſtacy from inherent faith, which ſpeaks only of the doctrine.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Faith is taken ſometimes <hi>actively,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>paſſively,</hi> Actively for fidelity and veracity in promiſes, in which ſence it's attributed to God, and to men. Sometimes paſſively for the aſſenting unto Truths becauſe of anothers Teſtimony; And this again is twofold, Either <hi>Humane Faith,</hi> when we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve any thing meerly beeauſe of humane authority; or divine, when we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, becauſe of divine authority; (and this is greatly to be obſerved) for when I believe a divine Truth for humane Authority or witneſſe, my Faith all that while is but humane; as thoſe that beleeved Chriſt, for the Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan Womans Teſtimony, all the while they had no higher a ground then that, it was but an humane Faith, and then a Papiſt as a Papiſt, and by Popiſh principles can have no more then an humane Faith, for the utmoſt motive in which their Faith is reſolved is the Authority of the Church, which is but humane, and ſo if the Church had propounded <hi>Titus Livius,</hi> or <hi>Aeſops Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles</hi> (as ſome grant) to be the Word of God, people were bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, but there is no divine Faith unleſſe there be a divine Teſtimony, and this doth ſadly diſcover Millions of baptized perſons, yet to have no divine Faith, for all the ground of their Chriſtian Faith is Education and humane Authority, it is not becauſe God hath ſaid it, or he hath revealed it; They cannot ſay with thoſe Samaritans, Now we believe no longer for E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation ſake, or the Churches ſake, but becauſe of the Authority and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Light which is coruſcant in the Scriptures themſelves; Inſomuch that the Jeſuite <hi>Valentia</hi> doth confeſſe there are ſuch inward diſcoveries of purity and Majeſty in the Scripture, that they breed ſuch an inward reverence and perſwaſion that no other book can do.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There is a diſtinction of great antiquity received in the Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Credere Deum,</hi> to beleeve there is a God, <hi>Credere Deo,</hi> to beleeve God ſpeaking, and <hi>Credere in Deum</hi> to beleeve in God by inward Union with him, and loving of him; Now although it be true, that the Scripture makes no ſuch difference, adding the Hebrew Prepoſition <hi>Beth,</hi> and the Greek <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, Even where there is but a bare hiſtoricall beleeving there is a God, yet for explication ſake it may be received, and thoſe only ſaid to beleeve in God, who are juſtified and ſanctified, Though the Scripture attribute it ſometimes to others.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Conſider that the Soul hath ſeveral <hi>tendencies and motions</hi> to divers Objects; Sometimes it aſſents to a thing by help of the <hi>ſence,</hi> and that is a knowledge by <hi>ſence,</hi> Sometimes by <hi>demonſtrative</hi> Reaſons, it knoweth a thing, and then it's called <hi>Science</hi> ſtrictly, Sometimes by Teſtimony or Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and then it's called <hi>Faith</hi>; Now if the authority be divine that ſaith ſuch a thing, then the Soul cannot be deceived, becauſe God cannot lye, and ſo there ought to be greater certainty and firmer adheſion to thoſe truths then any thing of ſence and Reaſon, yea, in ſome ſence it hath more evidence; For there is a twofold Evidence of the thing it ſelf, and of the credibility of it, of the thing it ſelf; And ſo indeed the matters of ſence and reaſon are more evident in their own Natures to us; Of the credibility of it, and ſo Faith hath great evidence, as the Teſtimonies for ſuch Truths are evident and clear, though the truths themſelves are ſupernatural and highly tranſcending our humane capacity.</p>

            <p n="1">1. <hi>It's wrought in us by the Grace of God</hi>; It's the power of God that works even this common faith: No man could know and give aſſent to ſuch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine truths, unleſſe inabled by the Spirit of God, and therefore it's ſaid to beleevers, <hi>That to them it's given to believe,</hi> Phil. 1.29.<note place="margin">1. It's wrought by the grace of God.</note> which takes in the whole nature of faith; So ſome are ſaid to believe through the grace of God, <hi>No man can ſay, Jeſus is the Lord, but by the Spirit,</hi> Acts 18.27. Some have thought that we may by humane ſtrength come to beleeve divine truths, as we may by our induſtry attain to philoſophicall knowledge; but this is to be ignorant of mans weakneſſe and Gods power. It's true, men may in an humane way comprehend the ſenſe and meaning of the Scripture, but to give a divine aſſent to it, that is the gift of God, <hi>For every good and perfect gift,</hi> whereof this faith is a principal one, <hi>cometh from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of lights,</hi> James 1. Did not many learned Heathens <hi>Porphyrius Celſus, Julian,</hi> and others, know what was aſſerted in the Scripture, yet they did not believe, but contemn it: And certainly we are bound to acknowledge it a great mercy of God to have dogmatical faith: For why are ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Heretiques left to themſelves? Some deny the Natures one, or the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Chriſt, ſome his Perſon, ſome his Offices, and ſhouldſt not thou doe thus, if left to thy ſelf? Nay, Is not a godly man ſometimes ſadly tempted about his dogmatical faith, that he doubteth of a God, or about the truths of the Scripture? Certainly, it's a ſpeciall mercy thus to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to believe; and it is good to be obſerved, one reaſon why faith muſt needs be of God, which is, becauſe the nature of it lieth more in the firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the act, then in the certainty of the ſubject: It's not ſo much the object without, as ſomething within, makes a man believe. Gods Spirit doth more work in corroborating the heart, then revealing the object; Hence though the Doctrine be revealed to ſome, yet they do not believe, when at another time, though they have but the ſame meaſure of light, and the ſame argument propounded, they do believe; and why is all this? but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Gods work in the believer is more <hi>ex parte ſubjecti,</hi> then <hi>objecti.</hi> Therefore it's horrible debaſing of Gods grace in working faith, to make it no more then the revealing of the object, for then man by his own power doth believe; as when a man brings a candle in the room, then a man ſeeth by his own power, who could not before; for God doth not only propound the object, but enlightens the underſtanding, and boweth the heart to believe.</p>

               <hi>yet it is a common grace of Gods Spirit.</hi> It's a common grace of God, to be inabled to believe: How many Phariſees and Jews ſaw the miracles of Chriſt, as well as the Apoſtles, yet did not believe ſo much as a <hi>Simon Magus</hi> did? It's the grace of God that makes a man to have a ſound minde in Religion, witneſſe the many hereſies and blaſphemies divers are fallen into, yet it's a <hi>common</hi> grace, not <hi>peculiar</hi>; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon I call it, not in that ſenſe as ſome plead for an <hi>univerſal grace,</hi> which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is <hi>no grace,</hi> but becauſe an unregenerate man may have it, as well as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate; ſo that no man may conclude this is enough for his ſalvation, that he doth believe ſuch and ſuch principles of Religion, unleſſe alſo he hath that peculiar effectual purifying work of faith upon his ſoul: As therefore thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary gifts of Gods Spirit, to work miracles, to caſt out Devils, were common to ſuch who yet were workers of iniquity; Thus it is with this ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary gift of Hiſtorical faith, many men may believe the truth of thoſe things, the goodneſſe whereof they never felt upon their hearts: And many may main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain

the Doctrine of Regeneration orthodoxly, who never felt the power of it experimentally upon their own ſouls. There is a faith that is common to the elect, all the children of God have the like precious faith, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.1. in regard of the eſſentials, yet there is a faith common to elect and reprobate, ſo that no man may conclude his ſalvation, becauſe he is no Jew, no Pagan, no Papiſt.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">8. Its the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion.</note>Secondly, <hi>Although this dogmatical Faith be common to the regenerate and unregenerate, yet it's the foundation of our converſion, and in the regenerate when improued, doth wonderfully provoke the increaſe of grace.</hi> And this is good to be obſerved; for though we make it not ſaving faith, yet it is <hi>the foundation of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving faith</hi>; He can never believe on Chriſt for his Mediatour, that doth not believe Chriſt to be a Mediatour; Therefore the Apoſtle deſcribing the general nature of faith, ſaith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. <hi>He that cometh to God muſt believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of thoſe that ſerve him</hi>: No ſpiritual building can be made without this foundation; as it is thus the foundation, ſo if improved, it doth wonderfully promote juſtifying faith. The general acts of faith, if vigorouſly proſecuted do mightily ſtrengthen the peculiar and proper acts of it. The more ſtrongly we believe Chriſt to be a Mediatour, the more will this help, that he be ſo to me; and therefore it's obſerved, that our Saviour put them ſo often upon the trial of their very hiſtorical faith, <hi>Doſt thou believe that I am able?</hi> and doeſt thou believe that I am the <hi>Meſſias?</hi> Partly, becauſe that was the great <hi>Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> then, Whether that individual Perſon was the <hi>Meſſias</hi> or no? and partly, becauſe if it was believed, that he was the Saviour, then there was no ſuch cauſe of doubt, Whether he would be a Saviour to them that truly ſought to him? Inſomuch that it may be queſtioned, <hi>Whether it be a greater act to believe Christ to be a Mediatour, or to believe him a Mediatour to me?</hi> Although indeed there are more Objections againſt the latter, for there are not only Objections againſt the truth, but againſt the application of it, becauſe of the many ſins and infirmities which I perceive in my ſelf, yet we would think the harder task were then over, when the ſoul could believe ſuch great things, and tranſcendent to humane reaſon; for when a man believeth that Chriſt is both God and man u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited in one Perſon, whoſe office is to redeem the oppreſſed ſinner, may not then he conclude eaſily, that he will redeem him? For which is greater, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve ſuch a Perſon God and man, or that this Perſon whoſe Office it is to ſave, will ſave thee? Howſoever, if we do not make compariſons between theſe acts of faith, yet certainly, the more ſtrong and powerfull thy acts of faith are about the truths of Chriſt, the more will they conduce to apply him to thee: Even as in man, the more vivid his ſenſes are, which do accompany his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon nature with a beaſt, the more ſtrong and quick are his rational acts like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe: So that this Dogmatical faith is the root as it were, which if not thriving, thoſe peculiar acts of faith will wither.</p>

               </gap>; We ſhall not diſpute, Whether this be a <hi>definition</hi> of faith, it's enough that two differential marks are given of it; And</p>
            <p>Firſt, It's the <hi>ſubſtance of things hoped for,</hi> concerning which word learned men ſay divers things, but it may comprehend theſe particulars; Firſt, that Faith is not an empty flying fancy, for ſo <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> uſeth <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, ſome manifeſtation meerly, as the colours of the Rainbow, or of birds feathers, when the Sunne ſhines. Theſe have but an intentional being, there is no reall, ſolid being in them, but faith is the ſubſtance of things hoped for; and certainly this is greatly to be endeavoured after, that thy faith be a reall ſubſtantial thing, how many mens faith are but fickle fancies, and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain notions, and therefore with their dogmatical faith, they are like the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>James</hi> his man without faith, <hi>toſſed up and down with every wave,</hi> Jam. 1. The Apoſtle <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.14. ſaith, <hi>Be not carried about with every winde of Doctrine,</hi> that denoteth the levity and emptineſſe of a thing; Trees that are well root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed are not blowne up and down like feathers; What then is the cauſe of inſtability and uncertainty of many mens Religion? It's becauſe they have not faith, whereſoever that is, it is a ſolid, ſubſtantial bottoming of the ſoul.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The word <hi>ſubſtance</hi> doth imply, that it makes the things hoped for, though afarre off, yet <hi>preſent to the ſoul,</hi> and even to <hi>ſubſiſt in the ſoul</hi>; for faith is not hindred in its actings by diſtance of place, for that <hi>receiveth Chriſt,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyeth Chriſt, though in Heaven, and he that <hi>believeth hath eternal life.</hi> Hence we are ſaid to be <hi>already tranſlated from death to life,</hi> John 5.24. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe to faith theſe things are as ſure, as if they were already done. Thus <hi>Paul,</hi> you ſee him by faith ſpeaking as confidently, as if he were in Heaven already, <hi>Rom</hi> 8. <hi>Who ſhall ſeparate us from the love of God, ſhall things preſent, or things to come? Shall life or death,</hi> &amp;c? Hence faith is called, <hi>The beholding of things not ſeen</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2 Cor. 3. Faith makes God preſent, Heaven preſent, Chriſt preſent, as really and truly, as bodily objects are preſent to ſenſe; and truly for want of this it is that we are ſo cold, languiſhing, dejected; we doe not by faith make theſe things preſent, if we did they would more divinely affect us, and as it is <hi>the ſubſtance of things hoped for,</hi> So of things feared likewiſe, <hi>Noah by faith moved with fear, prepared an Arke,</hi> Heb. 11.7. Thus faith makes hell and damnation preſent; it doth not look upon hell as a farre off, but is affected, as if it did ſee and hear thoſe dolefull howlings in hell, and ſo dare no more ſin, then if it were in hell already: Oh what a mighty change would faith, thus realizing things, work upon us!</p>

uſed both in Scripture, and by humane Authours, now this confidence of faith and aſſurance is ſeen, in the knowing and aſſenting acts of faith, as well as applicatory; witneſſe thoſe reſolute and confident deportments, which the Martyrs had: Had not they ſtrong aſſurance of the truth, who could en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure ſuch exquiſite torments againſt ſubtil oppoſers? And certainly the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> dayes are more to be admired then thoſe in the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive times, for they ſuffered upon undoubted and clear points, which only the Heathens gain-ſaid: But now theſe ſuffered by them that acknowledged a Chriſt, and pretended the Glory of Chriſt as well as they: So that this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly confidence, and ſatisfaction of the ſoul, that they care not for further diſputing, and doubting in the matters they do believe, is a great property in faith. And this manifeſteth there is little faith now in Religion, wherein men are apt to think all Religions alike, and that one may do as well as another: In theſe dayes to have ſuch a ſubſtantiating, reallizing and confident aſſurance, is a great wonder.</p>

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and that doth imply,</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>That the things believed bring an objective light with them.</hi> As the object that is ſeen brings a viſibility, though faith in reſpect of humane reaſon be obſcure, and ſupernatural Arguments be inevident, yet compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the light in the Word, it hath much evidence: Hence the word of God is ſo often compared to <hi>light,</hi> and that illumination which God worketh in the minde, is partly faith, as well as any other grace. The things that are believed bring an evidence with them to the ſoul; as the Sunne brings a viſibility with it to be ſeen: Therefore this believing is ſaid to be by the Word ſet home in the demonſtration of the Spirit; and hence it is a man in ſome ſenſe is paſſive in believing, as he is in underſtanding, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the object doth ſo powerfully work on the minde, that it cannot with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it; Even the <hi>Arminians</hi> could not but grant, That the work of Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit upon the underſtanding is irreſiſtible, though not upon the will, becauſe they ſay, that is an active faculty.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>The Word doth imply ſuch an evidence, that doth convince and binde up the underſtanding, that it cannot doubt or diſpute any longer.</hi> All evidence may not preſently convince; We ſee though erroneous perſons reade never ſo many excellent books, yet they are not actually convinced, the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence indeed is able to convince, as the Sunne-beams are able objectively to make a blinde man ſee, there is light enough if he had eyes; but faith is here ſaid, to be the actual conviction of the ſoul, to ſilence it, that it hath no more to ſay, according to the ſaying of the Schools, <hi>Fides non eſt tantum apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va, ſed quietativa</hi>; Faith is not only apprehenſive, but quietative and reſting of the ſoul; that it is not learning and learning, or ſeeking, but never coming to the truth.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">4. It hath univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſality in its aſſenting.</note>Fourthly, <hi>This Faith hath unlimitedneſſe, and univerſality in it's aſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> The whole Word of God is the adequate Object of it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whatſoever is revealed in the Scripture, it believeth, it doth not pick or chooſe, believe ſome things, and not others, as they make for, or againſt us, but ſo farre as the Word is propounded, it doth receive it. Therefore ſuch threatnings, that condemn man, that makes him dead in ſinne, and guilty of hell, ſuch threatnings that do ſpeak terribly to ſuch or ſuch a ſinne, he is involved in, though it be a troubleſome and unwelcome truth to fleſh and blood, yet Faith makes a man to believe it Whether Faith be diſcurſive, or put forth by one ſimple act, is diſputed, howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it cannot be denied, but that there is an order in the things believed, a connexion and dependance between one propoſition and another though when

            <p>OUR Saviour continueth amplifying his Prayer for the Union of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers; So that in this Text we may take notice of another <hi>argument</hi> or reaſon why the Father ſhould <hi>make them one in him and one amongst themſelves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here is a threefold Unity ſpoken of,
<list>
                  <item>1. That <hi>eſſentiall</hi> one of the father and the Son.</item>

               </list>
            </p>
            <p>The Argument urged by our Saviour in the Text, is, he had given that glory to them which the Father had given him, ſo that we may take the particle <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> cauſally for, <hi>the glory thou gaveſt me, I have given,</hi> viz. in purpoſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, to ſuch <hi>as ſhall beleeve</hi>; All the difficulty is, what is that glory which Chriſt receiving of the Father giveth to believers, Some Learned men expound it of the Glory of the Apoſtleſhip, and working of miracles, and they make the ſence to be thus, <hi>The glory thou gaveſt me to give, I have given them</hi>; As Cbriſt is ſaid out of the Pſalmiſt <hi>to receive gifts for men</hi>; Now becauſe he received them to give, The Apoſtle <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. alledgeth it as giving gifts to men, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent being put for the Antecedent; But this cannot be received becauſe our Saviour is now praying for all beleevers in all ſucceſſive ages, and not the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles only. Others by glory do underſtand immortality, and that ſtate of happineſſe hereafter; But to underſtand it aright we muſt know that the word <hi>glory</hi> when attributed to God is of a very large ſignification, but more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly <hi>when God doth by any works in a more remarkable manner declare his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, wiſedom, omnipotency,</hi> &amp;c. then he is ſaid to give his glory, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 39.21. <hi>Eze.</hi> 26.20. In the New Teſtament when we reade of Chriſts Glory we may Conſider of</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>His eſſentiall glory which he hath as God</hi> ſpoken of <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. where he is called <hi>the brightneſſe of his Fathers Glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Of his <hi>Mediatory Glory,</hi> which he had as Mediatour, his humane nature being filled with all grace, which glory though begun on earth, yet was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummated when exalted to the right hand of God in glory.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There were the <hi>many effects</hi> which did concomitate this eſſentiall and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatory glory, ſome particulars whereof the Scripture mentions, as all the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation

the Father gave from heaven to Chriſt, with all his <hi>miracles, doctrine,</hi> and <hi>other ſigns</hi> of his divine nature is called <hi>Chriſts glory,</hi> Joh. 1.14. <hi>We beheld his glory</hi> (by way of wonder and admiration, as the word ſignifieth) <hi>as the glory of the only begotten Son of God</hi>; Thus when Chriſt turned the water into wine, <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.11. It's ſaid, he <hi>manifeſted his glory,</hi> and <hi>Joh.</hi> 11. the raiſing of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus</hi> from the dead is called <hi>Gods glory,</hi> as working of miracles, So the <hi>love</hi> that the Father beſtoweth on Chriſt, is called <hi>Chriſts glory</hi> at 24 <hi>verſe</hi> in this Chapter, which may be a good Expoſition of this, Therefore by theſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars we are by the <hi>glory of Christ</hi> to underſtand <hi>all things that did any way make him glorious, especially conſidered as a Mediatour and an head of Beleevers</hi>; Now this glory he did not receive for <hi>himſelf only,</hi> but for us alſo; As the Sun of heaven hath its light not ſo much for it ſelf as for the world, So Chriſt the Sun of Righteouſneſſe hath a compleat fulneſſe, not ſo much for himſelf as for us, that we might be made partakers of it; Hence all the work of grace in its progreſſe to happineſſe is called <hi>glory,</hi> as 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. a place brought by <hi>Calvin</hi> to illuſtrate my Text, to which we may adde, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4 6. of which pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces more in time; The words thus explained obſerve,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the glory which Chriſt hath, he communicates one way or other to his people</hi>;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Obſerv.</hi> That the glory which Chriſt hath he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates one way or other to his people.</note> Chriſt thinketh it not ſufficient to have glory himſelf, but he doth <hi>communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the bleſſed effects thereof,</hi> ſo that they are made glorious likewiſe by him: The two ſimilitudes that Chriſt taketh to himſelf illuſtrate this, as that of an <hi>Head,</hi> If the head be crowned with glory, that redounds to all the body, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the head and the whole body are conſidered as one, and thus Chriſt though he be exalted to all glory and honour, and ſo it is his own perſonal pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge, yet all this is for our good, and that by being glorious himſelf he might alſo make us glorious; Hence ſome expound this glory of Chriſt concerning his Sonſhip, that he is the Son of God, and indeed it cannot be denied but that this is an eminent part of this glory; Now he hath not this Sonſhip only, but <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. <hi>He gives us power alſo to become the Sons of God</hi>; Only he is the Sonne of God by nature, we by grace and adoption; Another ſimilitude is that of an <hi>husband</hi> and <hi>wife</hi> ſo often mentioned in the <hi>Canticles,</hi> and by the Apoſtle; Now if the husband be a glorious King or Potentate, though he have a Wife of mean and deſpiſed birth, yet he communicates all his glory to her, and though God ſay of his eſſential glory, <hi>He will not give it to another</hi>; yet Chriſt gives of his glory in ſome ſence to his people, though they are not thereby made equal to him in glory.</p>
            <p>To underſtand this Doctrine Conſider,</p>

head in a ſpirituall and ſaving manner, but only external in reſpect of outward adminiſtrations, yet when this glory was communicated to work miracles there was a great difference between Chriſt and Beleevers, for he did them in his own name and power, but they through the Name of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. <hi>There were ſome things which Chriſt did, and they are made legally ours,</hi> God accounts us as if we had done them; Thus Chriſts Sufferings to take away the Curſe of the Law, and his obedience to the Rule of the Law is made ours, he being our Surety, and therefore <hi>by his Obedience</hi> we are ſaid <hi>to be made Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi>; His obeying the Law and ſuffering was not only for our good, as when he wrought Miracles and preached, but it was in our ſtead; Not as if we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were as righteous as Chriſt, or were Redeemers and Mediatours, but we are the Subjects receiving of it.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. <hi>There are glorious priviledges which Chriſt hath, and he gives them to us al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo:</hi> We are Sons as well as he, we are co-heirs with him in glory, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.

Oh the enlarged affections we ſhould have in this particular! Why do the people of God alwaies go bowed down, afflicted with their own unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe and temptations! Oh give faith ſome breathing-place, go and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate on this, The glory that Chriſt hath thou maiſt claim it alſo; Is he the Son of God? Is he heir? Is he exalted to glory? Know that thou art thus alſo, and although Chriſt is in the poſſeſſion of conſummate glory, but thou art wraſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and toiling in a miſerable world, yet as the Apoſtle argueth, if we ſhall not riſe, then Chriſt is not riſen, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. So if we ſhall not be glorified then Chriſt is not glorified; Hence our Saviour joyneth himſelf with the diſciples, <hi>I go to my Father and your Father,</hi> Joh. 20.17. and ſo its Chriſts glory and thy glory, Chriſts Heaven and thy Heaven.</p>

               <hi>the holy One,</hi> Luk. 1. but was this holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe for himſelf only? no, it was for his members alſo, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.10. <hi>Of his fulneſs we have received grace for grace</hi>; Some underſtand it by way of ſimilitude and imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as we ſay of a childe, he receiveth of his Father limb for limb, he anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his Father in every point, ſo we are to reſemble Chriſt, that as Chriſt is the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of the Father, ſo we are to be the Image of Chriſt, and therefore are laid to bear the Image of the heavenly, and thus we are made <hi>one with Chriſt</hi> as the ſeal and the wax are made one, the Seal leaving a ſtamp upon the wax like it ſelf; Now whereas the glory of Miracles others might have that were not united to Chriſt, this none can have but who are members of that head, and therefore do the people of God want grace, do they mourn under their imperfections, let them quicken up praier upon this conſideration, The glory Chriſt had he will give to beleevers, Why had he ſuch fulneſſe but for thy emptineſſe? Why had he ſuch glory but to make thee glorious? Shall <hi>our vile bodies be made glorious like his glorious body,</hi> and ſhall not our vile and corrupted ſouls be alſo made glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious like his ſoul? This is excellently illuſtrated, 2 <hi>Co.</hi> 3.18. where we are ſaid, <hi>te be transformed from glory to glory,</hi> that is from grace, grace is glory, ſo much god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs ſo much glory thou haſt, and becauſe it is not perfect, therefore we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from glory to glory, and how is this done? by the Goſpel, for we <hi>beholding the glory of God in Chriſt, are thereby changed</hi>; Thus 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6. the <hi>glory of God</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>ſeen in the face of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> the meaning is, that whereas God is in his own nature inviſible, and we are not able to conceive of him aright in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt; We ſee the infinite wiſedom and grace of God, ſo that we become

glorious in grace, by faith looking on God in Chriſt; this makes heavenly, this changeth and altereth the heart; That as <hi>Moſes</hi> by communing with God did obtain external glory which was ſo dazeling that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> could not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold it, So the people of God by Faith beholding God in Chriſt, are thereby enlivened and made more heavenly every day; Thus we ſee what thoſe effects of glory are which Chriſt gives of that treaſury of glory to us.</p>
            <p>In the third general place Conſider <hi>that none are made partakers of that Glory of Christ but by <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion with him,</hi>

               </gap>eſs, ſo that the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Chriſt with the believer is the foundation of all grace and glory, for as a branch ſeparated from the vine, or a member from the body doth not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of any vital act and nouriſhment, So neither doth that ſoul which is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned from Chriſt; if the beams of the Sunne had not immediate dependance and emanation from the Sun, they could not have ſuch luſtre and Glory, So neither were not believers joyned to Chriſt, and made one with him, they could not put forth ſuch glorious acts of grace as they do, for if power to work Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles and tranſcend nature be called a glory, how much more to perform the acts of grace, which do alſo ſurpaſs the courſe of nature; It's a glorious thing to beleeve, to be patient, to be heavenly-minded, to be zealous for God: In theſe actions the ſpirit of Chriſt which is alſo the ſpirit of glory doth reſide up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us.</p>
            <p n="4">4. As union with Chriſt makes us partakers of glory, So <hi>the foundation and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal of this is, becauſe Chriſt is one with the Father and one with us; He is the Mediator between God and man,</hi> So that by this means he receiveth glory from the Father, which otherwiſe would be incommunicable to ſinners, and doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey it to ſuch as are his members, So that ſtill our eyes are to he faſtened on <hi>Chriſt as a Mediator,</hi> for none can or may approach to God in his own ablolute nature, but as thoſe who cannot look upon the Sun behold it in a baſin of water, where the reflexion is; Thus we who could not draw nigh to that infinite wiſe and pure God, having a Mediatour that both partaketh of Gods Nature and mans, thereby is afforded an admirable paſſage of conveyance of glory from the Father through Chriſt to us, as the light is conveyed from the Sun through the glaſs into the houſe.</p>

            <p>HAving cleared the ſenſe of this Text, and ſhewed what that glory is, which Chriſt giveth us, Let us proceed to make ſome Corollaries, or practical Concluſions from this Doctrine.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">1. No man till he be united unto Chriſt, hath any true and ſolid glory</note>And hence therefore in the firſt place, this Concluſion is to be aſſerted, <hi>That no man till he be united unto Chriſt, hath any true and ſolid glory.</hi> For if the glory of a Chriſtian be in Chriſt the fountain; as the Sunne-beams are in the Sunne, then till partakers of Chriſt, we do not receive any of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: And this truth may quell the vain brags of the world, and the boaſts of carnal men: Some account <hi>riches</hi> their glory, their <hi>birth</hi> their glory, outward <hi>honours</hi> their glory, but theſe are not worthy the name of glory: Chriſt came not into the world to give men riches, honours, greatneſs, but a ſpiritual glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; The Hebrew word for <hi>glory</hi> ſignifieth a <hi>weight,</hi> and the Apoſtle alludes to this, when 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17. he cals the happineſs in Heaven <hi>an eternal weight of glory:</hi> Let therefore a man be never ſo much exalted in this world, yet if not given to Chriſt, he doth not partake of Chriſts glory; This earthly glory is no more true glory, then a glow-worm is the Sunne; The Scripture cals it <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a meer fancy that preſently paſſeth away. All humane glory is but like <hi>Jonahs gourd,</hi> that is preſently conſumed, or like <hi>Herod,</hi> Act. 12.21. who being arayed in royal apparel, and blaſphemous acclamations made to him, he was immediately eaten up with worms: Be not then any longer like children, that account a toy, a glorious thing, thou art no wiſer, when riches, greatneſs, beauty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are accounted matter of glory, an obedient ear to Gods word, is more glorious then an ear full of jewels; intereſt in Chriſt is greater glory, then all that of the world, which our Saviour was tempted with, yet is there any thing that is more apt to enſnare our hearts, then this vain-glory: Did not the Devil think to overcome even Chriſt himſelf in this temptation, when he ſhewed him all the glory of the world? Begin then to deſpiſe and contemn all the earthly glory of this world, what will this avail, when thou art vile in Gods eyes? Thou art a loathſom abominable creature before God, though richly cloathed, and faring deliciouſly every day.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">In what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects humane and earthly glory comes ſhort of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly.</note>Now the grounds, why humane and earthly glory do not ariſe to this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly, is from theſe particulars:</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>It's not a laſting, during glory:</hi> The fear and certainty of loſing of it, takes off from all the luſtre of it; A flour is a glorious creature, yet becauſe quickly withered, none makes long account of it; and thus all the glorious things of man are compared to no better. The Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> Iſa. 40.6. and
<pb n="609" facs="tcp:65216:324"/>
               <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt of all Sermons and truths were to proclaim this, <hi>All fleſh is graſſe, and the flower thereof fadeth away,</hi> &amp;c. And this was to make way for Chriſt, implying, that while men continued in their confidence about theſe things, they were too high mountains, and ſo no prepared path to receive Chriſt: As there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Saviour argued in another caſe, If the graſſe be ſo cloathed with glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that is to be cut down and withereth: ſo if thou art thus carefull to cloath thy body with glory, that preſently muſt become duſt and worms meat, rotting in the grave, how much rather ſhouldſt thou look to have thy ſoul cloathed with the glorious robes of Chriſt, that continue for ever; call that glory, and that alone which is eternal, which will live with thee, and not die with thee.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>It's no true glory, becauſe it's not inward and ſubſtantial.</hi> It's not this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of a man in his moſt ſubſtantial part, which is his ſoul. The ſoul of a man in Scripture language is called a mans glory, <hi>Gen.</hi> 49.6. unto their aſſembly, <hi>Let not my honour, or glory be united,</hi> that is, not my ſoul: If then a man hath the earthly glory of this world, this is not the honour of his ſoul, this is not ſolid, it's not in the nobleſt part of him: If rich and glorious apparel ſhould be put upon a dead corpſe, what glory were this to the corpſe, it would not bring life and comelineſſe to the dead body? So it is here, let a wicked man have more earthly glory then a <hi>Solomon,</hi> yet he is but a dead corpſe, he hath not that which ſhould be the proper glory of a man, <hi>viz.</hi> the adorning of his ſoul: Hence grace is called glory, as you heard: So that nothing makes a man glorious but grace, this is the image of God in him. The Heathen could ſay, That an horſe is not choſen by his trappings, and other rich accoutrements, but as he is naked in his own body; and certainly man much leſſe is accounted glorious by body or wealth, but by his ſoul.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>It's not the proper glory of a man as he is a Chriſtian:</hi> And this is much to be conſidered, Every creature hath that which is a peculiar grace and glory to it, in its kinde: So <hi>Seneca,</hi> We praiſe a Vine, if it burden its branches with fruit, if another had golden grapes, or golden leaves, the fruitfull Vine would be preferred before it. So that what is comely to one, is not to another; now take man as he is a Chriſtian, and ſo all his glory is ſpiritual and inviſible; if you look upon Chriſt, who giveth him his glory, he had none external, nay, none had leſſe of that then he, for he knew not where to lay his head, yet in regard of ſpiritual glory, he did abound in it, he had the glory of a <hi>Meſſias,</hi> though not of a temporal Monarch; and thus it is here, that is only a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans glory, which is excellency in Chriſtianity. The Apoſtle ſpeaking of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, ſaith, <hi>Whoſe glory, let not it be of embroidered apparel,</hi> &amp;c.

That then which the world doth deride and contemn, that is indeed the greateſt glory; and hence the glory of a Chriſtian is to be <hi>ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified,</hi> to be <hi>ſanctified,</hi> to have <hi>communion</hi> and <hi>fellowſhip</hi> with the Father in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, <hi>There is no true glory without Chriſt, becauſe in times of afflictions and tribulations, he only gives occaſion to glory.</hi> Rom. 5. <hi>We glory in tribulation</hi>; and <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>While we ſuffer for righteouſneſſe ſake, the Spirit of glory reſteth upon us,</hi> 1 Pet. 3.14. What then will thy outward glory avail in the time of Gods wrath, when he ſhall ſet thy ſins in order before thee, he will make all thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable things to periſh? When <hi>Belſhazzar</hi> is ſmitten with trembling for his ſins, he findes little glory in his ſtately Palace, in his golden cups he was carou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in: Oh then prize ſuch a glory that will bear up thy heart in the ſaddeſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities!<note place="margin">

in the world, for concerning that they made a blaze in their ſolemn inſtallings of the Pope, ſaying, <hi>Sic tranſit gloria mundi</hi>; but the glory of heaven abideth for ever. It's true, this world doth not ſee any glory in a believer, no more then they did in Chriſt: Therefore in the <hi>Caniicles</hi> the women asked the Spouſe, <hi>What was her beloved more then other women?</hi> They ſaw no ſuch comelineſſe and beauty in him; and thus it is with wicked men, What glory can we ſee in thoſe that walk more ſtrictly? What is admirable in them more then in others? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this glory Chriſt giveth his people is inviſible and diſcovered onely by the eye of faith: So that this ſhould exceedingly bear up the heart of a believer, while he lieth under all the reproaches, contempts and oppoſitions of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked world: Oh comfort thy ſelf with this ſpiritual glory; God gives thee glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Chriſt gives thee glory, while the world doth thus deſpiſe thee; and doe not be diſcontented, becauſe God hath not given thee ſo much of the worlds glory, as he hath <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>I have</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>given them glory already,</hi> yet he prayeth afterwards for the conſummation of this glory, and therefore that ſtate of happineſſe is properly called a ſtate of glory, yet we have the firſt fruits of it here. In part Chriſt doth inveſt us with his glory, but this is nothing to what ſhall be hereafter: Even in this life, the things are ſo great, <hi>That no eye hath ſeen, neither hath it entered into the heart of a man to conceive:</hi> How much more then will eternal glory ſurpaſs all our imaginations? Should not then the conſideration of this glorious portion we in part have, and expect more fully, make us walk comfortably, be chearfull in our afflictions, paſſe through this world with joy? Certainly we put not forth our fixed contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on this glory, if we did, our hearts would ſcarce ever be taken off it: <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxus</hi> was ſo affected with the glory of the Sunne, that he thought he was born onely to behold it: How much rather ſhould we think it our duty, all the day long to behold this glory? As the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17. profeſſeth, that all the <hi>afflictions</hi> he went through, and he had many, yet they were but <hi>light,</hi> and but for a <hi>moment, to that eternal weight of glory</hi>; and what made him think ſo? <hi>While we look not at the things which are not ſeen.</hi> If then thy heart is at any time dejected, diſquieted, oh think of this glory provided for thee, it will make thy ſoul ſilence it's crying and mutterings immediately, yea this will conquer the fear of death, and make the thoughts of it lovely and welcome.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>Doth Chriſt give ſpiritual glory to his? Then let this conſume all love and deſire of vain-glory,<note place="margin">IV.

The Phariſees <hi>prayed and gave alms to be ſeen of men</hi>; yea there is no external duty in Religion, but this may put a man upon it; But as love of Chriſt will kill the love of the world, fear of God will overcome fear of man, ſo a love to this ſpiritual glory will quickly out, vain-glory. It's good to obſerve, That though all other things in this world be vain, man is vain, beauty is vain, wealth is vain, yet cuſtom of ſpeech doth appropriate it only to <hi>glory,</hi>

It's a miſerable ſlavery to live dependently upon the breath of others, who many times do as children put a Garland upon one of their fellows heads, and then laugh at him behinde his back; ſo though they applaud thee to thy face, yet ſecretly backbite thee: Be therefore diligent to do Gods work, and content thy ſelf with the glory God beſtoweth upon thee: Doth a man running in a race regard the bird ſinging upon the tree? Eye Chriſt more, and man leſſe. The Moon that hath but a borrowed light, is ſometimes full, ſometimes at the wane, never certain: Thus a man that liveth upon the applauſe of others, and not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving his conſcience to God, he is ſometimes lifted up, and then dejected down, even as outward ſupplies come to him.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, <hi>Doth Chriſt give glory to his?

Admire the bounty of his grace.</note> neither will Chriſt give his Mediatory glory to others; only in ſome paſſages of glory, he is willing we ſhould reign with him, and be co-heirs with him. This ſheweth how much he loveth us; For certainly no man is willing to have another co-partner with him in his glory; yea how apt are we to envy the gifts and graces in others, that may overſhadow us, but Chriſt giveth of his glory to us.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, <hi>Doth Chriſt give glory to us? Let us then glorifie him again.</hi> Chriſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he giveth glory to us really and inwardly, but we only to him verbally and declaratively.

               <hi>They declare the glory of God, and ſhew his handy-work</hi>; and ſhalt not thou then in thy life, in thy converſation declare the glory of Chriſt?

                  <p>There is a twofold giving</p>
               </note>
               <hi>That Chriſt though God had many things given him of his Father</hi>; The Fathers giving of many things to him doth not take off from his divine Nature; This Truth will be profitable both to inform your judgement in that main Article of Religion, and alſo is of that practical conſequence; Therefore to clear this, Conſider,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That we may conceive of a two-fold giving,</hi> that which is natural and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, 2. that which is free and voluntary, ſo that it might or might not be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, for a naturall and neceſſary giving, So Chriſt as God hath his divine Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence from the Father, for the Father communicateth the God-head to his Son by neceſſary generation, So that it was not free to him whether he would have this Son or no, as it was whether he would create the world or no; It's true, there are ſome Learned men that ſay, <hi>Pater liberè genuit filium,</hi> becauſe in all that the Father doth, he doth it with underſtanding and will, which they make to be the formal cauſe of liberty; But thoſe that do ſo, take not liberty for that which may be or may not be, but for that which is immutably ſo, onely there is underſtanding and will concurring to it; In this ſence the expreſſion may be admitted, otherwiſe it would be blaſphemy to ſay the Father did ſo freely communicate the divine nature to the Sonne, that he might have choſen whether he would have done it or no; Therefore indeed if we ſpeak ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is not a giving of the Son of his Godhead unleſſe we take <hi>gift</hi> in a large ſence for that which is communicating, yet the Scripture cals it ſo, To this
<pb n="613" facs="tcp:65216:326"/>
purpoſe ſome bring that <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.26. <hi>As the Father hath life in himſelf, ſo hath he given to the Son to have life in himſelf</hi>; Where to have life in himſelf is the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt perfection that can be, and proper only to the ſupreme deity, yet this is given to the Son to have, and to have it ſo as the Father hath it, and therefore he is called the Son becauſe he hath his being of the Father eternally, and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers giving of this, or the Sons receiving of it argueth no imperfection but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in both.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There may be a giving to another <hi>by way of intrinſecall perfection,</hi> or by way of <hi>extrinſecall declaration</hi> and manifeſtation of this, when God gave Angels and men holineſſe this was to give internall perfection to them, but now when Angels and men declare the wiſedom, power, and goodneſſe of God praiſing and magnifying him for it; This addeth no inward perfection to him, only it outwardly declareth it, and thus it was with Chriſt as God, many things are ſaid to be given him, which yet he had with the Father before the world, only it's ſaid to be given him becauſe it was then declared and manifeſted what he had; Indeed if we ſpeak of Chriſts humane nature, ſo it had many things gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to it, which were an inward perfection to him in that reſpect, but in reſpect of his divine nature, ſo he was not capable of any new perfection, which he had not alwaies:</p>
            <p>Theſe things premiſed,<note place="margin">What things were given Chriſt of the Father.</note> Let us now conſider what was given him of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, And</p>
            <p n="1">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. Chriſt even as God had many things given him in reſpect of <hi>externall De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration</hi>: Thus when glory and honour is given unto him by the Father, as in that exceeding glorious manifeſtation, when it was ſaid, <hi>Thou art my well-belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Son,</hi> this was external glory, God gave the outward manifeſtation of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that which did already belong to him.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. We reade of his <hi>Office of Mediatorſhip,</hi> and <hi>that was alſo given to him</hi>: Hence it is that it's ſo often ſaid that the Father ſent him into the world, not as if the Son did not willingly conſent to this office alſo, only the Father he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned and appointed him who was alſo willing to this work; So that to be a Mediatour, to be ſent into the world, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they are mixt Attributes, for they denote perfection and ſome imperfection; <hi>To be ſent, To feel the glory of the Father,</hi> theſe denote he was man as well as God, but ſo to be ſent as by his own power and ſtrength to work out our Salvation, and purchaſe our peace, argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the higheſt pefection, which none but a God can do; So that this is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to be obſerved when the Scripture ſpeaks of his appointment to this offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Kingdom of a Mediatour, this no waies takes off from Chriſts God-head, but neceſſarily ſuppoſeth it, becauſe none but God can perform that work.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Scripture ſpeaks of <hi>perſons that are given him of the Father,</hi> and this expreſſion is very often with the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> in this Chapter, it's many times repeated, <hi>Thoſe that thou haſt given me,</hi> So Joh. 6.59. <hi>All that the Father hath given me will come unto me</hi>; Now theſe are ſaid to be given by the Father to Chriſt, not that Chriſt as God had them not before but <hi>in reſpect of his Mediatory Office,</hi> So that they are given to him that he ſhould by his death and merits bring them to Eternal happineſſe, and this makes greatly for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and conſolation of the godly, and this cannot argue any imperfection in Chriſt that theſe were given to him as a Mediatour, for he did not need them, he was happy without them, So that beleevers are given to Chriſt not for his good but for their own good, and therefore though Chriſt be the Head and beleevers members, yet it doth not follow, that becauſe the Head cannot be without members, but needeth the members as well as they do the head, that therefore Chriſt cannot be without beleevers; No, Chriſt took theſe to him, not out of want but out of bounty, He took them not to be bettered by them but to better them, not to perfect himſelf but them; As the Fountain is not help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="614" facs="tcp:65216:327"/>
by the ſtreams, but the ſtreams by the Fountain; Neither do the Stars en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten the Sun, but the Sun the Stars, So that if we Conſider in what ſence beleevers are given to Chriſt, we ſhall finde it's no imperfection in him, but perfection to be added to them.</p>

We reade of <hi>spirituall gifts and graces given to him,</hi> So he is ſaid <hi>to receive the Spirit without meaſure,</hi> and hence he is called <hi>Chriſt</hi> becauſe he is anointed with the oyle of all grace, and this is in reſpect of his humane nature: For the humane nature of Chriſt being a creature, and of the ſame univocal <hi>ſpecies</hi> with ours, it could not ſanctifie it ſelf, it could not adorn it ſelf with all habituall and actuall grace; Therefore in his conflicts an Angel was ſent to comfort him, We muſt therefore alwaies diſtinguiſh though not divide thoſe two Natures in Chriſt; As God he could not be anointed, he could not receive the Sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="2">2. This dominion and glory given to him is ſo farre from evacuating his Godhead, that it doth rather neceſſarily preſuppoſe it, for who can be made the Judge of the whole world? who can be exalted to be the King of Saints and the Nations but he who hath infinite wiſedom, power, and greatneſs?</p>

               <hi>That <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity among Believers is part of that Glory, which Chriſt as Mediatour hath obtained for them.</hi> For Chriſt ſpeaks here as Mediatour, in whom, and by whom only the ſpiritual unity of believers can be obtained.</p>
            <p>In this Doctrinal Propoſition three particulars are obſervable:</p>
            <p n="1">1. That Unity among believers is part of that ſpiritual glory Chriſt purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That Chriſt as Mediatour purchaſed Unity as well as other priviledges.</p>

                     <hi>Conſid.</hi> I. Unity is the Churches glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
                  <p>Their glory actively and paſſively.</p>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>That <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity is part of the Churches glory.</hi> It's their <hi>Glory</hi> both <hi>actively</hi> and <hi>paſſively</hi>; Their glory <hi>actively,</hi> they may in an humble and holy manner rejoyce in it: Not indeed as the Papiſts, who confidently and falſly triumph in their Unity, but in a godly and ſober manner; for if ſchiſms and diviſions in the Church, did ſo greatly divide and rend <hi>Pauls</hi> heart, no doubt but their Unity and accord did as much rejoyce him: Therefore how emphatically doth he ſpeak, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.1, 2. <hi>If any conſolation, if any bowels, fulfill ye my joy, that ye may be like minded,</hi> &amp;c. It's then the Miniſters glory, and the Churches glory to walk in lovely accord, when in the Church, as in <hi>Solomons</hi> Temple, the voice of the hammer is not heard; whenas God promiſed in reſpect of temporal peace, <hi>The ſword ſhould be turned into plow-ſhares,</hi> ſo the controverſal and pole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical part of Divinity ſhall be changed into the practical and affectionate part.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="617" facs="tcp:65216:328"/>Again, <hi>It's the glory of the Church paſſively,</hi> in this ſenſe, that for it we are exceedingly to glorifie and praiſe God; We ſhould look upon the ſpiritual peace of the Church, as a greater mercy then all external mercies; What an heavy thing is it, when <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſhall be made a <hi>Babel,</hi> when the Church ſhall be like the chaos and confuſion that was made at firſt, when God ſhall bring ſuch a ſpiritual judgement on the Church, as ſometimes he did a temporal one upon the enemies thereof, <hi>Every mans weapon againſt his neighbour, till they had deſtroyed one another?</hi> When therefore we ſee God forming the hearts of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers to uniting terms, this we ought to praiſe God for, as being a ſpecial means to promote Chriſts Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Now it's the glory of believers to be at Unity,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Becauſe this will exalt them in the very hearts and thoughts of their greatest enemies.</hi> What is glory, but the <hi>clara notitia,</hi> the famous acknowledging of the excellency of ſuch a thing? Now nothing will ſooner divulge the fame, and like the heavens, make the noiſe thereof to go through the Land, then unity and agreement: As <hi>Solomons</hi> wiſdom ſpread it ſelf over the world: Inſomuch that many came from afar to ſee and admire it: Thus it will be alſo for the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es accord, therefore the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> put an <hi>Ecce</hi> upon it, <hi>Behold how good and come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is for brethren to be of one accord,</hi> Pſal 133.1, 2. Thus you heard, The Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens admired the love of primitive Chriſtians, <hi>Ecce quam ſe mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uo diligenti, &amp; fratres vocant,</hi> whereas now we may ſay, Behold how they hate and oppoſe one another, calling one another by all uncharitable names. It's unity then, that makes the Churches fame to be over the world</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity is the glory of the Church, becauſe it ariſeth from the beauty and pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chritude of it.</hi> The beauty of a thing is the glory of it; now beauty doth ariſe from the ſweet harmony and proportion of all the parts, and this is the unity of the Church, when every member thereof is harmoniouſly joyned unto ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; when there is no diſſonancy or difference: Certainly, It's a better wiſh to ſee the Church in this glory, then that of <hi>Auſtins,</hi> to ſee <hi>Rome</hi> in all her temporal glory: If any member be deformed, or unproportionable to the other parts: How unlovely and uncomely doth it make that body? So it is here, if any make a rent, be proud, froward or oppoſite, the glory thereof is departed.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>It's part of their glory, becauſe the happineſſe and bleſſedneſſe of a Church, is in their Communion-graces.</hi> A Church denoteth ſome ſociety and company; Now the advantage of ſuch improvements is by union, if one part of the body be divided from the other, there is no ſuppeditation of mutual help, therefore there are nerves and ligaments in the body, to unite each part to other: You ſee in a civil ſociety, if there be not union, the glory of it preſently dieth: di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, like moths, riſe from within, and do immediately conſume; If then the happineſſe of believers lie in their communion-graces and duties; What can be more glorious then unity, which is the only means to procure ſubſerviency to one another, as if ſeveral Cities were ſupplied by pipes of water one to another, if thoſe pipes be ſtopt or cut, it brings a neceſſary deſtruction.</p>
            <p>The ſecond main particular is, <hi>That Chriſt purchaſed as Mediatour this pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge as well as others.</hi> He did not onely die to <hi>juſtifie them,</hi> to <hi>ſanctifie</hi> them,<note place="margin">II. Chriſt purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed as Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor this privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge as well as others.</note> but to <hi>unite</hi> them alſo: And this ſhould teach us ſeveral things. As</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>It ſhould not be accounted a ſlight and little ſinne to make any breaches or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions in Gods Church, to do any thing through ſtrife and vain-glory:</hi> Why? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Chriſt died againſt this; he as Mediatour intended not onely to <hi>ſave</hi> his people, but to bring them into <hi>one</hi>; Why then doſt thou by thy contentions, by thy heretical opinions thus ſinne againſt Chriſts death, his interceſſion and his prayer are for the ſame effects? Now you ſee in this Chapter, that his prayer for unity is ingeminated over and over again, and therefore Chriſt had this even in his thoughts, in his very <hi>death</hi>; hence it was that alſo at his death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="618" facs="tcp:65216:329"/>
he appointed the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, which though chiefly to <hi>ſeal Gods grace</hi> to us, yet it did alſo ſignifie the <hi>love</hi> we ought to have <hi>to one another,</hi> as the Apoſtle urgeth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. that as the <hi>ſeveral corns make up one bread,</hi> thus do the godly make up one myſtical body: Diviſions then in the Church are againſt Chriſts death, and againſt the Sacrament of his death; Shall we therefore runne into ſuch ſinnes, that have ſuch an hainous aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation?</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That the people of God, where they ſee theſe diviſions, are to improve this Argument for <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity:</hi> Even as when they groan under any corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and would gladly have the maſtery of it, they runne to the blood of Chriſt, praying, O Lord, Did not Chriſt die that theſe ſinnes might die? Was not Chriſt crucified, to crucifie theſe luſts? So it ought to be in matter of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Oh Lord, make all thy people of one heart, of one minde and ſpirit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Chriſt died for this alſo; let not his death be in vain: Thou wouldſt not ſuffer his bones to be broken, nor his garment divided, why then ſhall his Church be torn and divided? Do not think humane policies, and invented ſyncretiſms will be able to ſoder together? It muſt be this blood of Chriſt that obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth this.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Chriſt did not onely meritoriouſly purchaſe this <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity by his death, but in him exemplarily and formally we are made one:</hi> So that Chriſt is both the <hi>moral cauſe</hi> of this unity, and the <hi>exemplar</hi> alſo; for he by being both God and man in one Perſon, made God and man one, when there was ſuch an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite diſtance before, there is made the moſt intimate union that can be, even an <hi>hypoſtatical union</hi> between God and man: Now though we cannot attain to ſuch an union, yet by reaſon of this, all believers are made one with God, and amongſt themſelves: Hence is that often expreſſion of our being in him, of ingraffing in him, of living in him, all which do denote our intimate union with him; ſo that as Chriſt is not divided in himſelf: The Divine Nature doth not will one thing, and the humane Nature the contrary, but they have the ſame will; thus it ought to be here, one believer ſhould not judge one thing, and another the contrary, one love one thing, and another the contrary, but as Chriſt and the Father were one, ſo ought they to be.</p>
            <p>The laſt particular is, <hi>That God in Chriſt is the onely cauſe of unity amongst believers.</hi> Chriſt as Mediatour procureth it, and God through his merits vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafeth it, and this comprehends theſe particulars:</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That ſuch is the corruption of every man regenerate and unregenerate, that they would no more unite, then crums of ſand, did not God bring it about.</hi> Take men by nature, and they are wolves and devils one to another: Inſomuch that the preſerving of Commonwealths and civil Societies, is made a demonſtration of a God; for if ye conſider what every man is by nature, it's a wonder that the whole world is not full of <hi>Cains,</hi> and a meer <hi>Aceldama,</hi> like thoſe <hi>Cad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maan</hi> brethren the Poet ſpeaks of. God therefore who keeps the ſea within its bounds that it overfloweth not, doth alſo reſtrain and chain up the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men, that all be not in a confuſion; and although in regenerate men corruption is in a great meaſure ſubdued, yet that is not like <hi>Daniel's</hi> root of the Tree, that had a chain upon it never to grow, for this would be ſprouting out in ſtrifes and contentions, did not God put bounds to it, and therefore not onely Hiſtories that are prophane, but Eccleſiaſticall alſo doe abundantly witneſſe, That diviſions and differences have been the ruine of moſt Churches: So truly may we apply that of <hi>Job</hi> to the Church, <hi>If he commands peace, Who can forbid it? And if he bring warre, Who can withſtand it?</hi> Job 24.39. It's in godly mens natures to be ſo many <hi>Phaetons</hi> ſetting the Church on fire, if God by mercy did not prevent.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="619" facs="tcp:65216:329"/>2. <hi>God through Chriſt doth onely procure ſpiritual concord, becauſe hereby God is pleaſed with his Church, and reconciled.</hi> Now Gods anger for ſinne, is that which turneth Churches and States upſide down; even as you ſee the tempeſtuous windes doe fill the Sea with waves and unquietneſſe, <hi>Tranquillus Deus, tranquillat omnia.</hi> When God was angry with <hi>Abimelech,</hi> he ſent an evil ſpirit between him and the men of <hi>Sichem,</hi> Judg. 9.23. and this, like a fire, conſumed them: So when <hi>Solomon</hi> had diſpleaſed God by his Idolatries, then he ſtirreth up his adverſary, and that againſt him, and at laſt divides the Kingdom from him. So that you ſee, it's Gods anger for ſinne that makes diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord and implacable contentions to break forth. And thus it is alſo in the Church, <hi>When God is angry, then he ſuffers Heretiques and Schiſmaticks to ariſe, who divide it into as many pieces, as the Levites wife was:</hi> And till Gods anger be pacified, there can never be any ſetling or uniting, but as the two paſſengers in a ſhip at deadly feud one with another, did earneſtly look to ſee which would be drowned firſt, and not at all indeavour to ſave the ſhip. Thus private emulations have undone the publique; ſo that the Heathens may riſe up againſt the Church of God, for the <hi>Romans</hi> before they entred into the Senate-houſe to conſult for the publique, did firſt go and worſhip in a Temple dedicated to <hi>Jovi depoſitorio,</hi> becauſe there they did <hi>deponere inimicitias</hi>; but we go to prayer, to Sacraments, and offer our gift at the Altar, though we remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber men have juſtly many things againſt us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> Is peace and unity amongſt the godly their glory? Did Chriſt die for it? Doth God only give it? Then under all our breaches and differences, let us apply our ſelves to him, who hath this ſoveraign power over mens hearts: It's but his ſpeaking, and the windes and the waves will preſently ceaſe; he can quickly remove the bitter ſpirit of contradiction, and cauſe all to be of one minde; and certainly our ſins have highly diſpleaſed God, that yet he ſuffers his Church to wallow in her blood, that yet her wounds are not healed.</p>

            <p>OUr Saviour doth ſtill continue in prayer for Unity amongſt believers, which is not ſimply to terminate upon one another, but to aſcend higher, and all to be made one in Chriſt: Therefore in this verſe he ſheweth the original and fountain of their Unity, as alſo the manner of it. The <hi>Original</hi> of their Unity is from <hi>Chriſt</hi> being in them, and the <hi>Father</hi> in him; The <hi>Manner</hi> is ſpiritual; for as Chriſt is in them after a ſpiritual man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, ſo is alſo their union with him.</p>
            <p>The <hi>original</hi> of their unity expreſſed in thoſe words, <hi>I in them,</hi> deſerve our ſerious Meditations, for it's a choice practical point, and although a myſtery, and ſo without any reliſh to the carnal heart, yet full of comfort and ſavourineſs to the godly ſoul; Now Chriſt is ſaid to be in his people two wayes, either <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributively,</hi> in reſpect of every perſon; in which ſenſe the ſoul of every belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is the <hi>Temple of the holy Ghoſt</hi>; and <hi>Paul</hi> profeſſed, <hi>That he no longer lived, but Chriſt in him,</hi> Gal. 2.

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, <hi>That the Scripture doth not only ſay, Chriſt is in a believer, but he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth in him:</hi> As <hi>Paul,</hi> Gal. 2.20. And this denoteth, That Chriſts preſence in us is operative and active; for as life in a man <hi>quoad actum primum,</hi> doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes more or leſſe ſenſibly put forth life, <hi>quoad actum ſecundum</hi>; Thus it is with Chriſt, he is in the ſoul, not as he was once in the ſhip, aſleep, and ſo ceaſing from any action, but he liveth in us; for even as God in reſpect of the creatures doth ſtill work by Conſervation, as at firſt by Creation, ſo that if he did but for a moment with-draw his influence, this whole fabrick would fall into nothing. Thus it is alſo in reſpect of <hi>Grace,</hi> As Chriſt did at firſt put ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural life into us, ſo did he not continually act and enliven us, we ſhould quickly become dead in our ſinnes, but Chriſt liveth in us: And if you ſay, How then comes it about, that ſo many times Chriſt ſeemeth to be gone from the ſoul, that he hath left his habitation, that no life or workings of Chriſt appear? That may be anſwered afterwards; Onely for the preſent know, <hi>That Chriſt is the Sunne of Righteouſneſſe,</hi> Mal. 4.2. <hi>which ariſeth with healing in his wings</hi>; and he is the <hi>Tree of Life</hi>; yea he cals himſelf in the abſtract, <hi>I am the life,</hi> John 11.25. And therefore if thy heart be dead, dull, formal, the defect is not from Chriſt living, but by ſinfull obſtructions, by ſinne in thee: Even as it is ſaid of Chriſts Countrey, <hi>He could doe no miracles there, becauſe of their unbelief,</hi> Mark 6.6. But as Chriſt is ſaid to live in believers, ſo to abide in them, and that denoteth more then living; for Chriſt (were it not for the Covenant of Grace made ſure in his blood) might have lived in the godly, but his life in us might have paſſed away, as our life, and like a ſhadow; As God for a long while was with the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in a Tabernacle, that moved up and down, before he was in a Temple fixed. Thus God was graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly preſent in <hi>Adam,</hi> in the <hi>Apoſtate Angels</hi>; but this preſence was ambula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, onely now through Chriſt, he hath fixed his abode with us; he comes, and ſo dwels with us, that he will never go from us: When therefore Chriſt hath once begun to live in thee, he will alwayes abide ſo; Chriſt is alwayes in thy ſoul, though thou mayeſt not perceive it; yea the Scripture doth not onely ſay, <hi>Chriſt abideth in us,</hi> but that he <hi>dwelleth in us,</hi> Epheſ. 3.17. Now dwelling doth denote that intimateneſſe and familiarity, as alſo that care and coſt Chriſt is willing to beſtow on our ſouls: No man that is able will ſuffer his houſe he liveth in to runne to decay, and to fall into utter ruines, and indeed the houſe cannot take care for it ſelf, but the maſter doth: Thus it is here, Chriſt will not ſuffer his own dwelling-place to fall into decayes, he will ſee it be repaired: It will be Chriſts loſſe, as well as the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers.</p>

It is true, Chriſt and

                  </gap>i Theologi,</hi> as if they onely did enter into the Holy of Holies, and all other Writers were but meer literariſts, and theſe ſpeak much of ſuch raptures, and elevation of the ſoul, that in theſe pangs it doth loſe its own being, and is tranſeſſentiated into God: Many ſublime and unintelligible expreſſions they have, ſuch as the <hi>Paracelſians</hi> amongſt Phyſicians: Now what theſe ſay about God, many have an imitating language of <hi>in reſpect of Chriſt,</hi> but when Chriſt is ſaid to live and dwell in us, you muſt not conceive, as if we were turned into Chriſt, or Chriſt in us; we muſt not fancy ſuch an imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as the Papiſts do about Tranſubſtantiation, thinking that the bread is turned into the very body of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Hence in the ſecond place, It's horrible blaſphemy which ſome would inferre from Gods or Chriſts being in us, <hi>That they doe not ſinne at all</hi>; They work not, but God or Chriſt in them. <hi>Calvin</hi> of old wrote againſt ſuch Libertines, affirming, That by their horrid doctrines, they made God worſe then the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil: And of late there have been ſome, who have boldly vomited this poiſon of the red Dragon; let them commit never ſuch abominable and notorious crimes, they doe not ſinne, Why? Becauſe Chriſt is in them: But though Chriſt live in the godly in a ſpiritual ſenſe, yet they do not loſe their perſonall being or operations: It's not Chriſt that repents or believeth in them, but they themſelves, though he efficiently help to theſe duties, much leſſe is it Chriſt that ſinneth or commits iniquity in them.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, <hi>When Chriſt is ſaid to be in us, this is not to be underſtood, as if he were bodily living in us, as if his body were received into our body; No, the body of Chriſt is now exalted at the right hand of God in glory.</hi> And howſoever the <hi>Lutherans</hi> do hotly diſpute for the ubiquity of Chriſts body, yet that is to kick againſt the pricks. The Scripture is clear, That his body is ſo in Heaven, that it is not corporeally any where elſe. It's true, all beleevers do partake of whole Chriſt, of his Perſon, and therefore of his body, as well as of his Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; but the participation of his body is not after a bodily manner, he doth not live and dwell in us bodily. It's true, in the Virgin <hi>Mari<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, <hi>Neither is Chriſt in the godly, as if he did poſſeſſe our ſouls and bodies in the ſame ſenſe, as we reade of the Devils being in ſome perſons</hi>; for the Devil was ſo in them, that he wholly poſſeſſed their bodies, ſometimes torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them, and in others ſtrangely raiſing them up, to ſpeak in ſtrange tongues, and to do many wonderfull things above the ordinary courſe of mans ability: Chriſt is not thus in beleevers, and no wonder if Chriſt be not, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Learned obſerve, Though the Devil be ſuffered to poſſeſſe mens bodies, yet we never reade of any good Angel that poſſeſſed the body of any man, whereas God might have ſuffered the one as well as the other, if he had pleaſed. Let us then take heed of affirming any indecent, or falſe wayes of Chriſts being in us. Theſe latter dayes give inſtance of ſad deluſions in this kinde, men perſwading themſelves of Chriſts being in them after ſuch a palpable and bodily manner, that at laſt they are delivered up to think they are <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> himſelf, and whereas there is but one Chriſt, now there are many that ſay themſelves to be the <hi>Chriſt.</hi>

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly, <hi>Neither may we conceive of Chriſt being in us, as if he were a forme inwardly informing, or inclining us, as if our actions were Chriſts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</hi>
               <pb n="623" facs="tcp:65216:331"/>
Though the Apoſtle, <hi>Galat.</hi> 2. uſeth that expreſſion, <hi>I no longer live, but Chriſt in me,</hi> yet that is to be underſtood onely metaphorically, you muſt not take it ſtrictly and philoſophically, as if Chriſt were either the forme aſſiſting or informing of beleevers; not <hi>aſſiſting,</hi> as when An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels aſſumed bodies, and did ſpeak or act in them, and by them; or as ſome Philoſophers tell us of an <hi>intellectus agens,</hi> that is the common form to all mankinde, nor as a form <hi>informing,</hi> for that is made part of a man, but Chriſt is not ſo, and this is the reaſon, why though it be Chriſt li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and working in us, that makes to repent, and to believe, yet we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay, it's Chriſt that repents or believes, becauſe theſe actions come from us vitally and formally, whereas Chriſt is the efficient cauſe of them; and it's a Rule, <hi>Efficiens non poteſt ſupplere vicem formae &amp; materiae:</hi> So that as in reſpect of our naturall conſideration, though by God we live and move, yet we cannot ſay, it's God that ſpeaketh, it's God that walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, becauſe theſe are vital, formall actions; ſo neither can we ſay, it's Chriſt that believeth, that repenteth, that liveth in us: So that the believers work is to be diſtinguiſhed from Chriſts work in him.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, <hi>It's one thing for Chriſt to be with us, another thing in us.</hi> When Chriſt promiſed to be with his Apoſtles to the end of the world, that is, in reſpect of divine aſſiſtance, protection, and ſucceſſe, and thus he was with <hi>Judas,</hi> while he preached the Goſpel, and wrought miracles; for as God is providentially with many men, in whom yet he is not graciouſly preſent, as in <hi>Cyrus, Nebuchadnezzar, Jehu,</hi> and others. Thus Chriſt is alſo operatively with many, in whom he doth not graciouſly dwell: So that we are not to conclude Chriſt is in us, becauſe of many gifts and extraordinary abilities. It is true, <hi>John</hi> 15. Even a branch not bringing forth fruit, is ſaid to be <hi>in Chriſt,</hi> and ſo may hypocrites and reprobates be ſaid to be in him, but this is onely externally and by profeſſion, not internally and really.</p>

In the general, <hi>Chriſt being in his people is after a ſpirituall, inviſible, and myſtical manner</hi>; It is in an inviſible manner, yea, in no waies corporally ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible; We cannot with the eye ſee him, the ear hear him, or the hand feel him, but all is inviſible; And this is the reaſon, why natural men who are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away only as brute beaſts by ſenſible Objects are not affected with Chriſts being in his Children, for they ſay as the diſciple in another caſe, unleſſe we may <hi>put our fingers in Chriſts wounds, and feel his bones,</hi> we will not believe he is in us, but as God though he is omnipreſent and filleth all places, yet is not ſeen by the bodily eye, <hi>No man hath ſeen God at any time,</hi> Joh. 1.18. So though Chriſt fill his whole Church, and the Apoſtle expreſſeth it, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.11. <hi>he is all in all,</hi> yet this is after an inviſible and corporally indiſcernable mannes, ſo that though the Apoſtle who lived with Chriſt in a bodily manner, and was eye-witneſſe of all that he did and ſuffered, could ſay, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.1. <hi>That which we have ſeen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled,</hi> yet beleevers cannot now ſay ſo; As it is inviſible ſo it is ſpirituall, and therefore above a carnal apprehenſion; This is one of thoſe things of God a <hi>natural man cannot perceive becauſe ſpiritually diſcerned</hi>; Go to any natural man though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo cultivated and adorned with rationality, yet can he no more underſtand or conceive of Chriſts being in the ſoul, then a worm can reach to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and diſcourſe of Angels with one another, and the reaſon is becauſe there is no habitude or ſutable proportion between this truth and their capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities, So that as the Eye cannot ſee a Spirit becauſe of the diſſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> In the ſecond place, Though Chriſt be in us inviſibly and ſpiritually, yet he is <hi>truly, and really, and operatively in us,</hi> So that we are not to look upon this as a fancy or deluſion, as ſome non-entity or meer notions of melancholy men; No, as Chriſt is a reall Chriſt, ſo he doth really live and dwell in us; if nothing were reall but what is corporeall, then our ſouls ſhould be no reall ſubſtances; Then the ſoul of a man would be thought to be a meer fancy and notion like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe: But as Chriſt is reall and the ſoul is reall ſo is Chriſts dwelling and living in it reall, yea, it is ſo reall that corporal things are ſaid to have no reality at all comparatively; Thus Chriſt <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.1. <hi>I am the true Vine,</hi> and <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.55, 56. <hi>My fleſh is meat indeed, and my bloud is drink indeed, He that eateth my fleſh and drinketh my bloud dwelleth in me and I in him</hi>; Now why doth Chriſt ſay, his body is meat indeed, he doth not mean corporally but oppoſitely to corporall food; The very food we eat is not meat comparatively to Chriſt, for our bodies feed on that, and yet periſh, they have not life alwaies abiding in them, but who ſo hath Chriſt in him, he can no more periſh then Chriſt himſelf; Chriſt is meat indeed, and life indeed; The godly then finde and know this life and dwelling of Chriſt to be a reall, ſolid thing, and therefore do though not cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porally yet ſpiritually perceive it, and know it to be more reall then their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily life and actions; It's not leſſe reall and true becauſe ſpirituall and myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal; Therefore that which on Chriſts part maketh him to be in us, <hi>viz.</hi> his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that is reall, and that which on our part receiveth Chriſt, and whereby he dwelleth in us, <hi>viz.</hi> faith, that is, alſo a lively grace; Therefore though we walk not by bodily ſence but by faith, yet the things of Faith have as reall and lively ſubſiſtence in the ſoul as bodily objects can affect the body.</p>

many miles diſtant are preſent, Faith therefore receiveth the perſon of Chriſt, and it's not only the graces of Chriſt but Chriſt himſelf that dwels in the ſoul, but yet by faith it is true many Divines affirm the graces of Gods Spirit to be in us, but the Scripture doth expreſly relate even to the perſon of Chriſt and the Spirit as well as the graces flowing from them.</p>

            <p>THe next thing conſiderable in this Text is the higheſt round in this lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Unity, and that is, <hi>The Fathers being in Chriſt, As I am in them, ſo thou in me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The words need no further explication, then what will neceſſarily be diſcuſſed in the Doctrine; onely when Chriſt is ſaid to be in beleevers, and the Father in him, this is not to be underſtood excluſively, as if the Father were not alſo in beleevers, for the Scripture expreſſly affirmeth that <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.23. yea it's impoſſible to have the Son in us, and not the Father alſo, 2 <hi>ep. Joh.</hi> 29. <hi>He that abideth in the doctrine of Chriſt, hath both the Father and the Son.</hi> Yea <hi>we cannot know the Sonne, or believe in him, except we believe in the Father alſo, Joh.</hi> 1.4, 7, 8, 9. When <hi>Philip</hi> deſired Chriſt <hi>to ſhew him the Father,</hi> becauſe Chriſt ſpake ſo much of him, our Saviour doth firſt reprove <hi>Philip,</hi> and then inſtruct him: Reprove <hi>verſ.</hi> 9. <hi>Have I been ſo long time with you, and yet thou haſt not known me?</hi> Obſerve that, <hi>Philip</hi> deſired to ſee the Father, and Chriſt rebuketh him for not knowing of him; and then inſtructs him, <hi>He that hath ſeen me, hath ſeen the Father alſo</hi>; and thereupon he proceeds to exhortation, <hi>ver.</hi> 11. <hi>Believe me, that I am in the Father, and the Father in me.</hi> So that by this diſcourſe none can know or beleeve in Chriſt, but he muſt alſo know and beleeve in the Father; and becauſe the Diſciples were not ſo fully acquainted herein, they are checked by our Saviour, ſaying, <hi>Have I been ſo long time with you, and ye know not me?</hi> The longer time people have lived under means of grace, and yet not acquainted with divine truths, it is the greater condemnation. When we ſpeak of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers being in Chriſt, this is not to be underſtood in a ſpeculative and abſtracted ſenſe, but practically, and as it relateth to us, for to that purpoſe is it ſpoken by our Saviour, that hereby it might be ſhewed, that the Father is in us alſo.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Doct.</hi> As Chriſt is in us, ſo the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther being in Chriſt, is alſo thereby in us. How the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is in Chriſt.</note>Obſ. <hi>That as Chriſt is in us, ſo the Father being in Chriſt, is alſo there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by in us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this Poſition there are two diſtinct things,
<list>
                  <item>1. <hi>That the Father is in Chriſt.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. <hi>That by this means the Father is alſo, and abideth in us.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>For the firſt, <hi>The Father is in Chriſt,</hi> and that in ſeveral reſpects:</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>In reſpect of the Divine Nature,</hi> for ſo the Father is in the Son, as in the
<pb n="629" facs="tcp:65216:334"/>
               <hi>expreſſe Image, and repreſentation of him,</hi> thus the Son is called, <hi>the Image of his Father,</hi> Col. 1.15. Heb. 1.3. For as the ſon of a natural father doth many times repreſent him in lineaments, colour and all deportments: Thus Chriſt alſo as the Son of God doth demonſtrate the wiſdom, power and holineſs of his Father; Therefore <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. for the Father and Son to be one, is made the ſame, with the Father being in the Son, and the Son in the Father, for the Father is ſo in the Son, that he hath the ſame Nature, Eſſence and Attributes with him; and thus if the Son be in us, the Father alſo muſt be, becauſe they are one.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, <hi>The Father is in the Son in reſpect of operation and working:</hi> For this end it is, that in the whole courſe of his Mediatorſhip he referreth all to the Father, as he that ſent him. The doctrine he preached, he ſaith, <hi>was not his, but his Fathers,</hi> Joh. 14.10. <hi>The Father that dwels in me, worketh; the Father and I work hitherto</hi>; ſo that all that Chriſt did in preaching of the Word, in working of miracles, all theſe do declare, that the Father is in him; and this is of great conſequence, for hereby we may ſee, the ſalvation of a beleever deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, both by the Father and the Son; one was not more willing then another to procure this Redemption.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, <hi>The Father is in Chriſt, in reſpect of his infinite love,</hi> as <hi>amans</hi> is in <hi>amato,</hi> called therefore <hi>the Son of his love</hi>; Therefore this is mentioned in the Text, as part of this unity, <hi>That the world may know, thou haſt loved me</hi>; Though this love of the Father be not terminated on him only, but on all believers in him, and therefore it is that Chriſt cals him, <hi>his Father and their Father,</hi> and ſo ſome underſtand that tranſitively, <hi>In whom I am well-pleaſed,</hi> viz. with the godly, being reconciled through his blood to them; The Father then is in the Son, by way of love, and through him in all beleevers, by way of the ſame love.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, <hi>The Father is in Chriſt, by the communication of the fulnes of the God-head.</hi> This the Scripture giveth a notable deſcription of, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.9. <hi>For in him dwelleth all the God-head bodily.</hi> This place is worthy of a full conſideration; for it doth not ſpeak of the Fathers being in the Son, as the ſecond Perſon, but of the Father, as God, in his humane Nature, and the end why the Apoſtle bringeth this, is to take off all men from running either to Philoſophy, humane traditions, or Moſaical rites, becauſe the God-head is in Chriſt bodily: The Apoſtles Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is, Where there is a compleat perfection and fulneſs, there needeth no additaments, but in Chriſt there is a compleat fulneſs to all Evangelical purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and neceſſary matter to eternal ſalvation; and this is proved, becauſe <hi>in Chriſt dwelleth all the fulneſs of the God-head, bodily</hi>; In Chriſt, that is, in his <hi>humane Nature</hi>; all the <hi>God-head,</hi> that is, all the whole Nature and Attributes of God, wiſdom, righteouſneſs, holineſs, <hi>&amp;c. Dwelleth,</hi> that is, abideth, continueth, <hi>Bodily,</hi> that is, perſonally, in oppoſition firſt to the legal expreſſions of Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; as when God ſpake from between the <hi>Cherubims,</hi> as alſo in oppoſition to that efficacious preſence and aſſiſtance in the Prophets, and ſuch extraordinary holy men that he raiſed up; now God was in Chriſt tranſcendently to theſe, for he was in the humane Nature, ſo as to be made one Perſon with it, <hi>Filius Dei non aſſumpſit hominem perſonam, ſed aſſumpſit hominem in perſonam</hi>; and thus the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is in Chriſt, otherwiſe then in other creatures, and the minde of man is never able to comprehend ſufficiently this myſtery.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Laſtly, Which is the moſt proper ſenſe of this Text, <hi>The Father is in Chriſt, as a Mediator between God and man</hi>; for this is chiefly intended, That Chriſt is the bond of that union with the Father and believers, as alſo with believers amongſt themſelves: ſo that Chriſt is not here barely conſidered as God, nor barely as man, but as God-man, as Mediator; Thus the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. <hi>God was in Chriſt, reconciling the world unto himſelf, not imputing their treſpaſſes unto them</hi>; So that without Chriſt we are all at a diſtance, yea enmity with God, he is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming fire, and we nothing but ſtubble: Even as you ſee, the diſtance and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
<pb n="630" facs="tcp:65216:335"/>
of the devils to God: Are they one in Chriſt? Can they call God Father? and all is, becauſe they have not a Mediator: Here then is the ſpring-head of all conſolation, That the Father is in Chriſt, as a Mediator reconciling God and man together; and certainly, if the believer did more improve this truth, that he is made one with the Father and the Son, it would raiſe up his ſoul, he would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn himſelf, for all thoſe low, narrow and dejected thoughts, he is aſſaulted with, for how can ſin hurt him that is one with Chriſt? How can the devil deſtroy him that is one with God? Certainly theſe muſt deſtroy Chriſt and God alſo. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the devil overcame <hi>Adam</hi> and the Angels, but they were not one with Chriſt, they were not united to him in an inviolable Covenant, and therefore they quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpent all, and became bankrupts. This inſtance indeed ſheweth what we are in our ſelves, and that it is Chriſt only who beareth us up, but withall, it commands the ſoul to glory in Chriſt, to rejoyce in Chriſt, to triumph in Chriſt, for in him only we have pardon and boldneſs at the throne of grace.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> How the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Son can be in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, and yet they have ſuch great remaind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of ſinne in them?</note>Theſe glorious things being clear Scripture-truths, all the doubt is, <hi>How ſhall a Chriſtian perſwade himſelf that the Son and the Father abide in him, when he is ſenſible of ſuch corruption and ſin alſo in him? For who would not think, that when theſe high things are ſpoken, that Chriſt liveth and dwelleth in a man, that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Son do make their abode in him, but that ſuch a ſoul muſt be perfected, and made pure without ſin? Who would not think, that only a compleat and perfect man can ſay with</hi> Paul, I no longer, but Chriſt in me? <hi>Oh, ſaith the godly Soul, I may and muſt ſay the contrary, not Chriſt, but ſin, but the world liveth in me! And as it is thus for grace, ſo alſo for conſolation, If Chriſt be in a man, and he dwels there, How can there be ſuch black unbelieving thoughts? Where the Father and the Son is, there muſt be a heaven, not a hell: Can the Sun ariſe in its full glory and power, yet at the ſame time there be a black night? So how can Chriſt and the Father be in a believer, and yet they ſo ſubject to temptations and doubts, whether he be in them or no?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi>
               </note>Now for the firſt, <hi>How the Father and Son can be in a believer, and yet there be ſuch remainders of vigorous corruption in him?</hi> To this it is anſwered,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That if it be duly conſidered, how the Father and Chriſt is in us, it muſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently be conceived, that there is a preſence of ſin neceſſarily ſuppoſed in ſuch.</hi> For as you heard, God in us, and we in him, by Chriſt our Mediator; Now if we had perfection and freedom from ſin, we needed not a Mediator: So that as Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſuppoſe imperfection in the Communicant, thus doth alſo Chriſt in the perſon he is in; for if ſin were not there, How could he be in thee, as reconciling thee to God, as further ſanctifying thee, as healing thy corruptions? Therefore though in heaven, as ſome ſay, the myſtical union of Chriſt as Head, and the Church as his body ſhall never ceaſe, yet the manner of his preſence will ceaſe, he will not then be in us by faith, nor ſhall we appear in him before God, as media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for us, and covering our imperfections, for then ſhall all be done away; if then you obſerve, how Chriſt is in his people (to what end? you will conclude) if I were ſuch as I deſire and groan to be, then I did not need Chriſt to be after that manner preſent in me at all.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Though God and Chriſt be in us, yet they are in us, as free agents, communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting efficacy and power according to that meaſure and degree they pleaſe.</hi> If Chriſt were in us as a natural agent, as the fire burneth, or the Sun ſhineth, then he being alſo omnipotent, would produce the greateſt effects of grace poſſible in every beleever, becauſe he is free and worketh according to his own councel, therefore he diſtributeth grace, as he pleaſeth, to ſome more, to ſome leſſe, to none according to what ſhall be hereafter; Therefore though he might ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie thee perfectly, yet he will not.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Chriſt is not only in us thus freely working in us, but he hath alſo bounded and ordered the way of diſpenſations of his grace, ſo that he doth not put forth power in us
<pb n="631" facs="tcp:65216:335"/>
after we are regenerated, as if we were ſo many bruit creatures, but he requireth our co-operation and ſtirring up of our ſelves.</hi> Though in the initials of grace we are paſſive, yet not in the progreſs; and though it be Chriſt that doth daily quicken and preſerve us, yet we ſo diſtemper our ſelves, that ſome obſtructions may be put to his operative preſence. As</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief,</hi> Chriſt worketh in us, yet ſo as by faith, inſomuch that we are not onely juſtified by faith, but we are in the progreſs of holineſs, <hi>ſanctified by faith.</hi> Hence <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.17. Chriſt is ſaid, <hi>To dwell in our hearts by faith:</hi> It's by faith we receive of the fulneſs and fatneſs of Chriſt, inſomuch that where faith is not, there Chriſt doth not put forth his power; So that as our Saviour ſaid to <hi>Mary, If thou doeſt believe, thou ſhalt ſee the glory of God,</hi> Joh. 10. ſo if thou act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt faith, and doſt put that on working, then thou wilt both ſee and feel the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious preſence of Chriſt; Therefore there is no blame in Chriſt, his arm is not ſhortned; This fountain would ſend forth ſuch living ſtreams it uſeth to do, only thou dammeſt it up, that it cannot run.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Dulneſs and ſlothfulneſs,</hi> this doth much withſtand Chriſts operations. The Church in the <hi>Canticles,</hi> when ſhe was lazy and pretended excuſes, not letting in Chriſt, when he deſired to come in, made her at loſſe, and be without his preſence to her dear loſs; when Chriſt therefore hath quickned thee by prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grace, he hath many times knocked at the door, and there hath been no en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, this hath greatly hindred the courſe and flouriſhing of grace.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>When thou giveſt way to any groſs ſin,</hi> this makes Chriſt with-draw, ſo that little appeareth of him; This is like winter to the trees, that maketh all the ſap withdraw to the root, ſo that outwardly it appeareth a dead tree; Therefore caſt away that abominable thing, and then Chriſt will come and work as former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in thee.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Chriſt may live and work in thee, yet thou not be ſenſible and apprehenſive of it.</hi> It's Chriſt, but thou miſtakeſt him for ſomething elſe; as to the Diſciples, when Chriſt approached on the waters to them, he appeared to be a Spirit, at which they trembled, not thinking him to be Chriſt, and as <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> thought it had been the <hi>Gardner,</hi> when it was her Lord. Thus the godly ſoul, though Chriſt at that very time doth evidently work in it, yet through black diſtempers doth not indeed judge Chriſt to be there.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, <hi>Chriſt ſometimes purpoſely withdraws his operative preſence to try us,</hi> that we might ſee our own infirmities, that we might the more earneſtly prize his power and grace: Even as in the ſhip, Chriſt did on purpoſe ſleep, that the Diſciples being in extremity might the more earneſtly awaken him; Thus <hi>Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit in te Chriſtus,</hi> and as <hi>Joſeph</hi> to his brethren diſcovers not who he is, that ſo he may be the more welcome afterwards.</p>
            <p>And as for the ſecond Queſtion, <hi>How can Chriſt be in thee, and yet thou have no comfort and aſſurance?</hi> You may ſee the poſſibility of that in Chriſt himſelf, who though ſo dearly beloved of the Father, and the Father was in him, yet for the preſent thoſe heavenly conſolations were ſuſpended.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of Inſtruction,</hi> to demonſtrate the happy condition of ſuch as do believe, <hi>They have God and Chriſt within them</hi>; Though contemptible veſſels, yet they have a glorious treaſure within; Though the Cabinet have no excellency, yet the Jewel hath. Take heed then of grieving ſuch a noble gueſt within thee; when a noble perſon enters into thy houſe, how doth it trouble thee, that any offenſive object ſhould come before him? Be thou as much carefull, left any vain thought, any evil action ſhould moleſt him.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>THoſe words contain the effect and fruit of that former Unity ſpecified viz. <hi>Chriſt in us, and the Father in him</hi>; for our Saviour here ſpeaks of a three-fold Unity,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Of the Father with Chriſt,</hi> as Mediator.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Of Chriſt,</hi> as Mediator and Head with <hi>his Church.</hi>

            <p>Now this is the laſt time our Saviour repeateth this particular of unity; for our Saviour doth in this prayer for believers four times repeat it, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrateth his exceeding ardent affections for it, only every expreſſion ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to riſe higher then the former.</p>
            <p>The firſt is, <hi>That they may be one.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. That they <hi>may be one in us.</hi>

            <p>Obſ. <hi>That the Father and Chriſts being in believers, is the cauſe of that perfect and conſummate unity, which they ought to have of themſelves.</hi> There could be no union in the body, if the Head did not unite it.

            <p>To open this, let us conſider, <hi>What is implied in their being made perfect in one.</hi> And</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Here is implied ſincerity and uprightneſſe</hi>; That their unity be from a pure heart and unfeigned faith. This is often the uſe of the word <hi>perfect,</hi> as oppoſed to that which is falſe and counterfeit; many are ſaid <hi>to walk with a

perfect heart,</hi> becauſe they did not walk with an heart, and an heart by diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; ſo that it's a perfection of eſſence and parts, not of degrees; and this indeed is greatly to be urged, that as all the other things in the godly be ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, ſo their unity, that they be joyned together from ſpiritual principles, and by ſpiritual means: It was the Heathens Poſition, That <hi>amicitia</hi> could one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be <hi>inter bonos,</hi> that whatſoever friendſhip was from <hi>bono utili,</hi> or <hi>jacundo,</hi> and not <hi>honeſto,</hi> it did not deſerve the name of friendſhip: Now how much more is this true in that unity amongſt the godly, which hath for it's cauſe and original, Chriſt himſelf, and for it's patern, ſuch an unity, that the Father and Sonne have? To be perfect then in unity, is to have ſincere hearts one to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards another, as the Apoſtle <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. <hi>Let love be without diſſimulation</hi>; Let there be no water to debaſe this wine, let not this fair fruit be rotten at the core.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>To be perfect in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> doth imply, <hi>not onely ſincerity, but inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity of all thoſe ſubſtantials and eſſentials, wherein this oneneſſe doth conſiſt.</hi> You have heard, that the Unity of believers doth empty it ſelf into two great ſtreams, one of Faith, in reſpect of Doctrine; The other of Charity, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of life and affections: Therefore if any of theſe be wanting, the Unity is diſſolved; if love be pretended, but yet there is no divine truth, this is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy, not unity; and if faith be pretended, but not love, as yet we have no ſigne of the true Diſciples of Chriſt; Let then the Church of God, look it hath theſe two pillars, like <hi>Jachin</hi> and <hi>Boaz</hi> to bear it up. All Unity without Truth is like a ſtately building upon ſand, and Truth without love is like a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation without ſuperſtruction; pray that the Spirit of God would lead into all truth, for the former; and would alſo work thoſe ſanctifying fruits of it, love, peace, meekneſs, <hi>&amp;c</hi> for the latter.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>The word perfect in one,</hi> doth imply, <hi>an increaſe and daily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe in the way of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity.</hi> For though the Church of Chriſt be his Body, yet it's a growing body, it's not come to it's full ſtature, no not in this life; There are further degrees to be attained, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.13. We are to grow to a perfect man in Chriſt Jeſus; and thus we reade of many called perfect, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.6. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.14. not in an abſolute ſenſe, but comparatively, becauſe they are carried on to further degrees of grace then others: We are not then to think, that any Church will have ſuch perfect Unity in this life, but that it may be more perfected; In the beſt conſtituted Churches there are ſeveral imperfections, there is much weakneſs, many carnal affections, which are apt to diſcompoſe the beautifull frame of the Church.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, It doth imply, <hi>That they are perfected in thoſe means, which are appointed by God for this <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity.</hi> For ſeeing the means are wholly for the end, the end can never be better enjoyned then formerly, if the means be not bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter improved; ſo that if the Church of God be perfected more in one, it muſt more faithfully improve the means of unity, and they are eſpecially two,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The preaching of the Word of God</hi>; For as by that at firſt the Church is called out of the world, ſo by that alſo it's kept up in it's purity, and unity. The Word of God preached is the onely means appointed to remove igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and mortifie corruptions, which are the rares that hinder the good ſeed: As the <hi>envious man</hi> ſoweth theſe, ſo the Spirit of Chriſt by the Word worketh the clean contrary. Hence <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. the Miniſtry is appointed as a means to bring us to this perfect ſtature: farre be it therefore from them to make diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and rents in the Church of God, whoſe great office and imployment is to proclaim peace: The good ſhepherd will not ſuffer his ſheep ſo to fight with one another, as thereby to be deſtroyed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The Sacrament of the Lords Supper, that is a ſpecial means to preſerve <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, yea and to perfect it.</hi> The Apoſtle 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. ſpeaketh fully to this, <hi>For
<pb n="634" facs="tcp:65216:337"/>
we being many are one bread, and one body, for we are all partakers of that one bread:</hi> So <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. <hi>one Baptiſme</hi> is brought as an ingagement to unity: Therefore the more graciouſly and perfectly theſe Ordinances are received, the more is this unity confirmed and eſtabliſhed; and therefore thoſe primitive Chriſtians, who had one ſoul, and one heart, were conſtant alſo in their breaking of bread, whereby their mutual love was ſtrongly preſerved.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bellarmine</hi> not unfitly ſpeaks of a ſix-fold Unity in the Church:</p>
            <p>The firſt is, <hi>Ratione principii,</hi> of God who calleth, though (as he ſaith) this makes the Church not ſo much <hi>una</hi> as <hi>ſub uno,</hi> one as under one.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Ratione ultimi finis,</hi> the ſalvation to which it's called, and this makes the Church not ſo much one, as <hi>ad unum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Ratione Mediorum,</hi> in reſpect of the means of Faith and Sacraments; and thus the Church is rather by one then one.</p>
            <p n="4">4. In reſpect of the holy Ghoſt, as a ſeparated Governour.</p>
            <p n="5">5. In reſpect of Chriſt, as an internal and conjoyned Head.</p>
            <p n="6">6. In reſpect of the connexion of the Members amongſt themſelves, and in theſe two laſt reſpects it's properly one.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, <hi>This <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity will be wholly perfected in Heaven</hi>; Then will all partition walls be deſtroyed; Then ſhall it no more be ſaid, <hi>I am of Paul, and I am of Apollo, but God will be all in all.</hi> Therefore as this life is a place, like <hi>Hada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drimmon,</hi> a valley of tears, bewailing corruptions and ſinnes amongſt us; ſo alſo the diviſions and breaches that are upon us: But in Heaven, all opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, all different wayes will ceaſe: So that although this unity for the main of it, be attained in this life, yet in the life to come, there it will be totally compleated; Thus it is here perfect, becauſe the endeavours and breathings of the godly ſhould be after that heavenly unity, to have it with the Church here in grace, as it ſhall be with the Church hereafter in glory: And certainly, if this were not accompliſhed in Heaven, then there would not be all tears wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped away, nor would the reproach of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ceaſe.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The cauſes of this unity.</note>Thus you have heard what it is, that makes this unity of believers conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate and perfect.</p>
            <p>Now let us conſider, What is the cauſe of this, and that we ſhall finde to be no humane ſtrength, or outward wiſdome and policy, but the <hi>lively communication of grace inabling thereunto by Chriſt himſelf.</hi> Though the Papiſt pleades, That the acknowledgement of one viſible Head in the Church, is the onely means to preſerve unity, yet experience ſheweth the falſeneſſe of it. The diviſions and breaches of the godly, like thoſe of <hi>Reuben,</hi> have made ſad workings of heart, and many have come running in, with their water to quench this fire: Several Antidotes have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed againſt this corruption, but yet when all is done, <hi>It's the onely power of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> as Head of his Church, that workes this ſweet Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony. It's true indeed, many rules and pacificall means are commended by wiſe and godly men to make an unity, but theſe work onely morally and ſwaſorily; that which doth (as it were) phyſically and really worke it, is the Lord Chriſt himſelfe, as the fountain of this unity: And the reaſon is, becauſe this unity among believers, is not onely externall, but internall and ſpirituall; Now no man can worke this unity in the hearts of the godly, any more then he can worke purity, and holineſſe: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſee in the Text, That becauſe Chriſt is in us, and the Father in Chriſt, therefore are the godly perfected in one; ſo that it requireth a Divine, Supernaturall power to make the godly at heavenly accord; even as it doth to make them godly. Hence it is that in this prayer Chriſt commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it to God to work it, as being beyond all humane power to effect it: Now
<pb n="635" facs="tcp:65216:337"/>
Chriſts being in a believer, is a cauſe of theſe things in reference to their unity.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>He is thereby a cauſe of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity it ſelf:</hi> For we told you, This unity, though externall, yet is chiefly ſpirituall and internall, <hi>viz.</hi> The harmonious knitting and joyning of all the Members of Chriſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, in him their Head: Now this being wholly ſpirituall, none can ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it, but God alone; for naturally we are diſ-joyned from God, and full of contrariety to him: Therefore to be made a member of Chriſt, and implanted into him, cannot be by any other, but the Spirit of God: As thoſe dry bones in <hi>Ezekiel</hi> could not of themſelves gather together, nor can a Cyen graft it ſelf into a ſtock; Thus it is here, till the Spirit of God joyne us to Chriſt, we are enemies and adverſaries unto him. That power therefore which gives grace, that onely unites, As in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall body, the ſame cauſe which makes a member<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> makes it alſo a united member: Inſomuch that in all the fractions and diviſions we ſee amongſt the godly, we ought to have our eyes up more to God, to conſider that power which makes them holy, muſt unite them; and indeed to make them gracious and holy is the greater work, yea unity would flow by a neceſſary reſultancy from our memberſhip in Chriſt, but that ſtill our corruptions are too ſtrong and apt to diſturb all.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Chriſts being in us, is not onely the cauſe of our <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity, but alſo of the harmonious ſutable proportion to each other.</hi> We have an admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable deſcription of this harmonious ſutableneſſe in the unity of Chriſts body, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2.19. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.15, 16. For the firſt, It's a Text full of rich and glorious matter, and to underſtand it, conſider, What it is that the Apoſtle makes the cauſe why thoſe falſe Teachers did advance the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of Angels, introduce humane traditions, and all to ſet up other means and wayes of Juſtification, then the Scripture hath appointed, <hi>It is</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>becauſe they hold not the Head:</hi> So that every Chriſtian in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of all ſpirituall concernments, is ſtill to look up to Chriſt, as the Head, and not to let him goe; and this he amplifieth from a two-fold precious effect of this Head; The firſt reſpects the union of beleevers to Chriſt, and ſo the body is ſaid by joynts to receive nouriſhment, that as the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy hath it's nouriſhment ſuppeditated by thoſe natural helpes, ſo hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Chriſtian from Chriſt: Now the joynt that ſuppeditates theſe ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall helps, is chiefly the Spirit of God: So <hi>Romans</hi> 8.9. <hi>If any man have net the Spirit of Chriſt, he is none of his:</hi> So that as that is not a member truely united to the Head, which is not informed with the ſame forme, the Head is; ſo neither is that Chriſtian really united to Chriſt, which wants the Spirit of Chriſt: Now the Spirit of Chriſt is here ſaid, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>To adminiſter nouriſhment.</hi> The word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> doth properly ſignifie to ſupply all thoſe ornaments, which were neceſſary to ſuch as kept their ſacred dancings and feſtivities, but here it ſignifieth the ſupply of thoſe things that are neceſſary for our ſpirituall end, and the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> added, amplifieth it, denoting the full, plentifull and abundant ſupply it giveth. So that you ſee, it's Chriſts Spirit, not ours, which doth thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able us.</p>
            <p>The ſecond benefit flowing from Chriſt our Head, is of <hi>the Members themſelves.</hi> They by bands are knit together; Now the band here is chiefly alſo the Spirit of God, though gifts and graces doe ordinarily u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite: So the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.13. <hi>For we all by one Spirit are baptized into one body:</hi> So that the Spirit of God, which is in Chriſt, doth alſo work in all beleevers, inflaming and exciting to ſuch graces, whereby they
<pb n="636" facs="tcp:65216:338"/>
have intimate communion one with another. Now from theſe two bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits conjoyned, we have the admirable fruit thereof, that the body grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with the increaſe of God. The ſpirituall growth of Chriſtians, as in the body, is called, <hi>The increaſe of God</hi>; partly, becauſe God onely is the efficient, and cauſe of it; partly formally, becauſe the nature of this increaſe is divine and heavenly; partly finally, becauſe it is to the glory and honour of God. So that by all this we ſee, Every true mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Chriſt is a thriving and growing member, and that harmoniouſly according to it's reſpective nature, and all this comes wholly by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Chriſt; ſo that an unity in the harmonious increaſe of it, depends ſolely upon him. By this Explication, the other fore-mentioned Text may alſo be diſcovered.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, <hi>Chriſts being in us, is the cauſe of the perpetuity and conſtancy of that <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity the godly have.</hi> This Union in Chriſts body can never be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved. As the Perſonall Union of Chriſt could never be divided, ſo neither the myſticall. Therefore our ſound Divines doe well from Chriſts in-dwelling in us, propugne and aſſert the perſeverance of the Saints.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of Inſtruction,</hi> Whence it is, that even amongſt the godly there are ſo many differences, heart-burnings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It's becauſe Chriſt is not in them after ſuch a powerfull and efficacious manner, as he might be. The dark night and miſty fogs can no more endure before the glorious beams of the Sunne, then corrupt paſſions and contentions can ſtand before this Sunne of Righteouſneſſe, when riſen to it's verticall point. Under the torrid Zone there cannot be any cold froſts, ſo neither under the efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous preſence of Chriſt can there be ſuch ſinfull breaches.</p>

            <p>What is meant by <hi>world</hi> hath been ſhewed already; I ſhall only faſten on this Conſideration, that what our Saviour called <hi>believing</hi> ver. 21. here is called <hi>knowing,</hi> and therefore having handled faith in its ſpecifical nature as it reſts on Chriſt, which alone juſtifieth, and alſo the generall nature of it as it gives firm aſſent to all divine Truths:</p>
            <p>I ſhall now to compleat the full Truth of the nature thereof handle it in <hi>another eſſentiall conſtituting ingredient of it,</hi> and that is knowledge, and the matter is neceſſary both in reſpect of doctrinall errours about it, as alſo for practicall uſefulneſſe, For the <hi>Pontificians</hi> they deny both that fiduciall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbency and application to faith, as alſo knowledge, leaving it only to be a divine aſſent, but as we have aſſerted the former, So now our task ſhall be to affirm the latter, <hi>viz. That Faith is knowledge as well as aſſent</hi>; It's a fiduciall aſſent with knowledge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Theſe three particulars are either ingredient or requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to the act of beleeving, whether indeed knowledge be a pre-requiſite or ingredient is diſputed, but that all divine Faith hath knowledge is confeſſed by the Orthodox againſt the Papiſts; ſo that I ſhall obſerve,</p>

               </gap>ct of his faith was ſpiritual, that Chriſt was the Sonne of the living God; What then we know by ſenſe, we are not properly ſaid to believe, although things of ſenſe may tend to confirm our faith, as mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles and Sacraments, which Chriſt hath appointed for that end.</p>

Doubting</hi> is when the minde remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in an equal and indifferent propenſion, aſſenting to neither part of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. <hi>Suſpicion</hi> is, when the ſoul inclineth to one part of the propoſition, but upon a very light and unſatisfying argument: And <hi>Opinion</hi> is, when we aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to ſomething with ſome fear, that the oppoſite may be true, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Arguments do only probably move us: Now the knowledge of faith doth exclude theſe imperfections, doubting is in Scripture expreſly oppoſed to beleeving, and ſo when a man is divided, as a traveller at two wayes, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which to goe, or when he doth <gap reason="foreign">

will have ſuch knowledge as ſhall be fetcht from the inward reaſon of things, and this is the cauſe why the Trinity and Incarnation of Chriſt are deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, becauſe reaſon is made the Judge of theſe things, but the knowledge of faith is not like that of the Philoſophers, who ſearched into the cauſes and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward principles of things, for then the Scriptures would not be commended to us, but the <hi>Platoes</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> of the world.</p>
            <p>Therefore fifthly, <hi>The knowledge faith brings, is a knowledge reſpecting the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony and revelation of a thing, and the authority of him, who doth reveal it,</hi>
               <note place="margin">What know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the knowledge of faith is.</note> 
               <hi>that he is the ſupream verity, and therefore cannot lie.</hi> We ſee in an humane faith, a man cannot believe that which he doth not know witneſſed, a thing that he never heard ſpoken of; and this is that which we juſtly blame the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> for, That it teacheth an <hi>implicit faith,</hi> viz. <hi>That we believe what the Church believeth</hi>; but now, what is it that the Church believeth, they know not, and it may be never heard of it? Therefore that is the way to lead men blindfold to hell; for this <hi>implicit faith</hi> is indeed nothing but a <hi>ſimple groſſe ignorance</hi>; but faith divine knoweth the teſtimony, or that word which revealeth ſuch truth, not that they only can believe, who can reade, for <hi>Faith cometh by hearing,</hi> as well as reading, ſo that they may know the truth confirmed in the Scripture, though they cannot reade it: Faith therefore is not blinde, nor is the obedience of it in this ſenſe blinde, as if it did not know what it did believe, with ſuch blinde Sacrifices God is not well-pleaſed; and the woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> is reproved, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe worſhipped ſhe knew not what,</hi> Joh. 4. and it's no leſſe guilt when we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve we know not what,</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>There is not only a knowledge of the teſtimony, but ſome, though imperfect knowledge of the very things themſelves.</hi> Thus <hi>Paul, I know whom I have believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> 2 Tim. 1.22. and ſo in many places the people of God are ſaid <hi>to know God, to know Chriſt</hi>; There is an apprehenſive knowledge, though not a compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive; Therefore though God doth not give perfect knowledge in this life, yet he could, if he pleaſe, turn faith into viſion; He that made the corporal blinde to ſee, can alſo take away mental blindneſs, but he is pleaſed to let us have but imperfect knowledge, and that partly becauſe we ought to be humbled in our ſelves, for we ſee the pride and ſinfull corruption of man, when it gets any knowledge in the Scripture, how ready to be lifted up, to deſpiſe others, to think we are wiſer then <hi>Solomon,</hi> which makes the Apoſtle ſay, <hi>Knowledge puf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feth up,</hi> 1 Cor. 8.1. not that it doth ſo of it ſelf, for of it ſelf it would rather humble and debaſe, but ſuch is our corruption and vanity, that without the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial grace of God, as we grow in knowledge, ſo alſo we grow in pride. Again, God keepeth us in imperfect knowledge here, that ſo we might be in conſtant prayer and dependance on him, to beg for knowledge, and an underſtanding heart, as alſo that we might ſtudy and meditate, to be alwayes growing in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, as the Apoſtle exhorts; Hence it is that there are ſo many difficult pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in Scripture, which will exerciſe the thoughts of the moſt learned, and thoſe things the ableſt men do know, yet they may grow in a more firm, diſtinct and powerfull knowledge. This Sun may ariſe upon them by degrees, till at laſt it comes to its vertical point.</p>

To what purpoſe alſo are thoſe frequent exhortations to all private perſons, as well as Officers, to <hi>at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the reading of it, to prove all things, to try all things?</hi> Can the Scripture be made uſe of?

               <pb n="640" facs="tcp:65216:340"/>2. <hi>As the Word is light</hi> objectivè, <hi>ſo the believer himſelf is light</hi> ſubjectivè. Hence they are called <hi>light in the Lord,</hi> light in the very abſtract, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.8. and the Scripture ſpeaks often, of their illumination, having their underſtandings and hearts opened; inſomuch, that the ſoul is a meer chaos and confuſion till God create this light in it; faith then is accompanied with internal light, as well as it requireth external.</p>

            <p n="4">4. <hi>The juſt is to be ſaved by his faith</hi>; Now if faith hath no knowledge, this properly is another mans faith; if faith hath no knowledge, but believeth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Church believeth ſo, or a Councel believeth ſo, then it's not ſo much his own faith, as the Churches faith that muſt ſave him.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, <hi>If faith hath not knowledge, then it's impoſſible to diſcharge all thoſe ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of faith, that the Scripture ſpeaks of,</hi> as to cleave and adhere to the <hi>truth,</hi> to refuſe <hi>falſhood,</hi> and all cunning deceivableneſs of errour.

            <head>SERMON CXXXI. Of the unſpeakable Love of God to Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers; Shewing wherein Gods Love to Chriſt, and to Believers is alike, and wherein it differs.</head>
            <epigraph>
               <bibl>JOHN 17.23.</bibl>
               <q>And haſt loved them, as thou hast loved me.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>A Two-fold <hi>Effect</hi> or <hi>Event</hi> is propounded by our Saviour, of the <hi>unity</hi> which believers have, firſt, <hi>in Chriſt,</hi> and then <hi>amongst themſelves</hi>;</p>
            <p>The firſt is, <hi>That the world may know, thou haſt ſent me</hi>; of which we have briefly treated already, becauſe our Saviour had mentioned it, <hi>v.</hi> 21. and indeed our Saviour doth in theſe verſes with ſo much plainneſs ingemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate the matter of his Petition, that <hi>Luther</hi> on the place ſaith, Theſe words do <hi>pueriliter ſonare, judicio rationis,</hi> and that he was wont to ſay often, That he never read a book containing ſuch excellent and ſublime matter in ſuch ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and plain words.</p>
            <p>The ſecond <hi>Effect</hi> or <hi>Event</hi> is, <hi>That the world may know, that thou haſt loved them, as thou haſt loved me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that in this latter particular, there is one truth ſuppoſed, and another pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed: That which is ſuppoſed is, that it's of great conſequence for the world to know that God loveth believers, it would ſtop much of their malice and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, if they did truly know, that ſuch whom they oppoſe and perſecute, are the believed ones of God: But of that afterwards. That which is expreſly affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is, that the Father loveth believers, as he loveth Chriſt himſelf. A wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and amazing expreſſion it is, that believers and Chriſt ſhould be thus cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled together, that when there is ſuch an infinite diſparity, that yet they ſhould both agree in the ſame love: So that in the words you have, the mercy and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge God vouchſafeth to believers, he loveth them. Now when we ſay, God loveth, it's to ſay all things, for that is the fountain and treaſury of all good things; his love is like himſelf, infinite, omnipotent and efficacious.</p>
            <p n="2">2. You have <hi>the example or manner of this love,</hi> and that is ſaid to be, as he <hi>loveth Chriſt</hi> The Greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Auſtin</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi> do explain not of ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude, but of cauſality, and ſo reſolve it into this ſenſe. The Father loveth believers, becauſe he loveth Chriſt, and indeed this is a grand truth, that in Chriſt only we are accepted of, and beloved. It's not becauſe of our ſelves, but of Chriſt, that we are approved of, yet there is no neceſſity of leaving the grammatical interpretation, for the Father doth love us, as he loveth Chriſt not in reſpect of <hi>equality,</hi> but <hi>ſimilitude,</hi> as they are ſaid to be one, as the Father and Son are one. Theſe words then do contain the very honey and honey-comb of Chriſtianity, in that they are loved of the Father, as Chriſt is, they need no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="642" facs="tcp:65216:341"/>
more, for Gods love will put him upon all thoſe effects that a believer ſtands in need of.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Obſerv.</hi> God the Father loveth belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, even as he loveth Chriſt.</note>Obſerv. <hi>That God the Father loveth believers, even as he loveth Chriſt himſelf.</hi> A great truth, and as you would think, a bold and preſumptuous affirmation.</p>
            <p>Therefore to clear it, <hi>Let us conſider, wherein the love of God to Chriſt and believers is not alike, and wherein they are like one to another.</hi> And</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">I. Wherein the love of God to Chriſt and believers is not alike.</note>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, <hi>The love of the Father to Chriſt, is as to his onely natural begotten Sonne, but to believers, as to his adopted children.</hi> And therefore between theſe there muſt be a vaſt difference; The love of the Father to the Sonne is like that of the Father to himſelf, becauſe he is of the ſame eſſence with him, ſo that he loveth the glory and honour of his Sonne, as his own glory, but now that love which he beareth to his adopted children, is of an inferiour nature, they are crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures onely, and their holineſſe is but imperfect, and by way of quality, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident in them, but the Sonne is eſſentially holy; ſo that in this reſpect there is no compariſon to be made between the Sonne and us; That love differeth <hi>toto genere</hi> in this ſenſe, from the love beſtowed on us, even as his filiation is not of the ſame univocal nature with ours.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, <hi>Therefore the love which the Father ſheweth to his Sonne, is neceſſary and natural</hi>; he could not but love him, no more then he could not, but beget him, whereas to believers <hi>it's voluntary, and wholly of free diſpenſation.</hi> It's di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputed in the Schools, Whether the Father did beget the Sonne neceſſarily, or freely, and ſo by conſequence, Whether his love be neceſſary or free; but the ſoundeſt Writers ſay, That a neceſſity of unitability and freedom do not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe one another, a neceſſity from natural imperfection contradicts liberty as a perfection, but not that which ariſeth from the chiefeſt and higheſt perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſo it is in God; It's from his infinite perfection, that he cannot but love himſelf, and his Sonne, but now in reſpect of his adopted ſons, all is of meer grace, which he doth to them, <hi>John</hi> 1. It's he that gives an <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>a right and priviledge to them, to become the ſons of God,</hi> God could have taken infinite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in his own Sonne, that was object ſatisfying enough, there needed no other then him to take his delight in, yet he was pleaſed contrary to the cuſtoms of men, though he had a natural Sonne of his own, to aſſume adopted ones likewiſe.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, <hi>The Father loveth the Sonne originally for his own ſake, but he loveth believers for Chriſts ſake.</hi> And this indeed doth mainly put the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Fathers love to us and Chriſt, here Chriſt is loved for his own ſake, he needed no Mediator, or another Chriſt to procure his acceptance, for ſo there would have been imperfection in Chriſt, but in us, all our hope, all our well-pleaſing is through him; So that as every Starre ſhineth by the light of the Sunne, thus doth every believer appear comely in the robes of Chriſts righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe only. Thus the Apoſtle <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. declareth fully, <hi>When he would not be found in his own righteouſneſſe, but that which is through faith in Chriſt:</hi> So that as it was the Temple, which made every thing holy, thus it is the Lord Chriſt, which makes every creature accepted of.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Laſtly, <hi>Chriſt is not capable of ſome effects of ſuch love, which the Father doth vouchſafe believers.</hi> To us he gives <hi>Pardon of ſinne, Juſtification by faith,</hi> in us he works <hi>repentance, faith,</hi> and <hi>ſubdueth</hi> the reliques of corruption in us, but ſuch was the perfection of Chriſt, that he could not have ſuch kinde of love demonſtrated to him.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">II. Wherein Gods love to Chriſt and believers is alike.</note>Having thus ſeen the diſparity, and that ſtill Chriſt hath the preheminency in Gods love, <hi>Let us conſider wherein Chriſt and we agree in Gods love.</hi> And</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Gods love is terminated not on Chriſt ſimply, but as the head of believers.</hi> So that Chriſt and his Church are conſidered as <hi>one myſticall perſon,</hi> and this is chiefly aimed at in all thoſe places,<note place="margin">1.</note> where Chriſt ſpeaks of his being in believers,
<pb n="643" facs="tcp:65216:341"/>
and that they are his body,<note place="margin">In loving Chriſt and them as one myſtical per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</note> all is to draw up our hearts into an high admiration of Gods love herein, for God doth now look upon Chriſt and believers as one, if he loveth Chriſt, he muſt needs love them; if he hate them, or caſt them off, he muſt hate, and caſt off Chriſt: Inſomuch that if a Chriſtian deſires to get up into a Mount of Transfiguration, let him aſcend up hither; for what will fill the heart with heaven, if this do not, I and Chriſt are loved, as one? Though the Father loveth Chriſt in ſome reſpects tranſcendently to us, yet in other reſpects, he makes his love common to us both. Certainly faith in this great and precious truth, would be a conſtant cordial; Thou feareſt thy ſinnes and imperfections may caſt thee out of Gods love, but are they able to caſt Chriſt out of his Fathers love, if they cannot do the one, neither can they the other? Chriſt and a believer is made one, when one is loved, the other muſt neceſſarily be loved, and if one be hated, the other alſo muſt be hated.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>The Fathers love to Chriſt and us is alike in the properties of it.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. In the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of it.</note> Love to Chriſt is not differing in it's properties from that he loveth us with. As</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>It's eternal love,</hi> As the Father loved Chriſt before the world was, ſo he did alſo all believers in Chriſt before the foundation of the world was laid. This our Saviour ſpeaketh of, <hi>verſ.</hi> 24. <hi>Thou lovedſt me before the foundation of the world,</hi> and that he ſheweth the like love to all believers, is often declared, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.4. <hi>We are choſen in Chriſt before the foundation of the world.</hi> The love then which the Father beareth to believers is an eternal love: It's not ſhorter in time then that to Chriſt, for in eternity there is no <hi>prius</hi> nor <hi>poſterius</hi>; As then the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther loved Chriſt alwayes, even from all eternity, ſo he doth likewiſe every believer; before thou hadſt a being, before either thy ſelf, or any friend in the world could take any care of thee, God did pitch his love upon thee: Oh then, let not the people of God, think God is like man, that he began to day or ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterday to love thee! No, it was from all eternity, and that love brought forth in time, all the other effects of love, that <hi>called</hi> thee, that <hi>juſtified thee,</hi> and that will <hi>glorifie thee</hi>; Therefore the Apoſtle when he ſpeaks of theſe bleſſed effects in time, he reſolveth all into this love from eternity, as the Spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head of all.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>The Fathers love to Chriſt and believers are alike in the property of unchangeableneſſe and immutability.</hi> God will no more alter his love, or ceaſe to love his children, then he will Chriſt himſelf; This is plain, becauſe all the promiſes to the godly are <hi>Yea and Amen in Chriſt,</hi> 2 Cor. 1.20. he is their Mediator, in him they are made one with the Father: So that by the ſame cauſe of perpetuity in his Headſhip, by the ſame will they certainly perſevere to us. Thus it is ſaid, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>Who ſhall ſeparate us from the love of God?</hi> He challeng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth any thing to break this love, if they can. Grant then, that the Father may love Chriſt in ſome peculiar reſpects, which thou art not capable of, yet in this thou and Chriſt are alike, God will never change the love of his Sonne into ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, he will never become of a Father an enemy to him, ſo neither will he to any true believer. As long as his love ſhall continue unchangeable to his Son, ſo long it will to thee; and thus Gods love to thee is on a firmer bottome, then that of Mount <hi>Zion,</hi> or the Ordinance God hath made with heaven and earth, or the day and night, for all theſe ſhall wax old, but the love of God like him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſhall abide for ever.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>The Fathers love hath the property of freeneſſe, both to us and Chriſt.</hi> Indeed if we conſider Chriſt as God, ſo the Father loved him neceſſarily, but as he was man, and a Mediator, ſo the Fathers love to him was free, for it was of the meer goodneſſe of God to appoint him to be a Mediator; The humane Nature was not aſſumed for any fore-ſeen merits in it, but all was from the meer good pleaſure of God, and this
<pb n="644" facs="tcp:65216:342"/>
holds much more true in all the gracious effects that we partake of, therefore the great ſcope of the Scripture is to declare this, that all the priviledges and mercies we partake of, come not from any worth, or deſert in our ſelves, but wholly from the grace and meer love of God; Inſomuch that all thoſe opinions which make the riſe of any good we enjoy, to be firſt our love to God, and not Gods love to us, are to be accurſed; as if the earth did firſt water the heavens, and then the heavens the earth.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">3. In regard of the effects of it</note>In the third place, <hi>The Fathers love to Chriſt and believers, is alike in regard of the real and true effects of it.</hi> As to Chriſt it was not a love <hi>in word,</hi> or <hi>ſhew,</hi> but <hi>power and mighty operations,</hi> ſo it is alſo to every believer: Though there be a difference, yet the love is as real to one, as the other; Even as when the firſt commandment of loving God, is ſaid to be the greateſt, yet at the ſame time the ſecond is ſaid to be like it, in reſpect of obligation, though not of dignity, Thus it is as firmly, and as really love to believers as to Chriſt, though not ſo principally; and although ſome effects of love, we partake of, which Chriſt is not capable of, yet there are others that we do communicate in. As</p>
            <p n="1">1 One great effect of the Fathers love to Chriſt, while in the dayes of his ſuffering fleſh, was the <hi>protection, defence and incouragement that he had from the Father</hi>; for Chriſt in the whole courſe of his Miniſtry, by faith depended on his Father; inſomuch that though the malice of his enemies was importunate to deſtroy him, yet they could never accompliſh their deſign, till the Fathers time was come, and then, though he prayed to the Father to be ſaved from that hour, yet it was only conditional, and therefore he ſubmitted himſelf abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Gods will. Now the ſame fatherly care Chriſt had experience of in his whole courſe, the ſame may believers expect; Therefore <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. he tels them, <hi>I go to my Father, and your Father,</hi> he is the ſame Father to both: Oh then, why ſhould a believer under any extremities or agonies be caſt down, the ſame fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly love thou mayeſt look for, as Chriſt himſelf met with.</p>
            <p>A ſecond real effect of the Fathers love, is <hi>Glorification of Chriſt</hi>; The glory that Chriſt was to have after his ſufferings, is often mentioned in the Scripture. In this Chapter we ſee our Saviour earneſtly praying for it, and after his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, we reade how highly he was exalted, and what glory he was lifted up into; now the Father loveth all believers with the ſame efficacy, as they ſuffer with Chriſt, ſo they ſhall reign with him, here they are ſaid not only to be <hi>ſons,</hi> but <hi>heirs and co-heirs with Chriſt,</hi> they ſhall ſit on thrones of glory with Chriſt. Thus Gods love runs in the ſame effects to Chriſt and us.</p>

               <hi>for he giveth him to be a ranſom and price for us, Chriſt is made a curſe, dieth an ignominious and a pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full death, not for himſelf, but for us, by which it may appear, that the Fathers love is more to us then to him, for he delivers him to death, that we might live, he is made a man of ſorrows and full of grief, to provide conſolation for us, ſo that Chriſt ſeemeth to be but the means, and we the end, and the end hath more amability and appetibility in it then the means.</hi> But to this, theſe things may be returned by way of anſwer,</p>

               <hi>he did it as an efficient cauſe, by his own inward worth and power.</hi> So that our ſpiritual mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies are <hi>not</hi> ſo much to be conſidered, <hi>the end</hi> of Chriſts death, as the <hi>effects</hi> of it: So that we may truly ſay, what the people did to <hi>David,</hi> in an higher man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to Chriſt, <hi>Thou art worth ten thouſand of us,</hi> yea then all believers: So that Chriſt died not for us, in ſuch a way, as when a Martyr dieth for the truth, or a private perſon for the Common-wealth, for theſe die to preferre a greater good above the leſs; The truth of God is more worth, then any mans life; The publique good is more precious, then the temporal advantage of any one man; and in theſe inſtances, the leſſer good is loſt for the greater; but when Chriſt was thus afflicted by the Father for us, this was, that a greater good might ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a leſſer; for in Chriſts blood, there was plenty and all fulneſs to redeem his people; ſo that we are not to look on Chriſt dying, as a meer <hi>paſſive</hi> means or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained for us, but as an <hi>active</hi> means, by the cauſality and vertue whereof our eternal good is accompliſhed.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, <hi>The Father doth not love us more then Chriſt, though for a while he was made miſerable for us, for Chriſts willing offering up of himſelf to this Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, did infinitely draw out the love of God to him</hi>; So that the Father loved him the more, becauſe he would out himſelf from the exerciſe and actual enjoyment of his Fathers love for a ſeaſon, that he was contented for a time to be in thoſe agonies and conflicts, grapling with the ſenſe of his Fathers diſpleaſure, for this
<pb n="646" facs="tcp:65216:343"/>
very reaſon, his Father did infinitely love him, ſo Chriſt himſelf witneſſeth, <hi>Job.</hi> 10.17. <hi>Therefore doth my Father love me, becauſe I lay down my life for my ſheep</hi>; and herein was the Fathers love and acceptance ſeen, that upon his ſufferings the Father exalted him to ſuch tranſcendent glory, <hi>exalting him above every name that is named</hi>: So that although many Divines ſay, Chriſt merited nothing for himſelf, yet others ſay with great confidence, That the Covenant which was made with Chriſt as our Mediatour, did promiſe him all that mediatorial honour and glory which he enjoyed, upon the diſcharge of his Suretiſhip, and this they make to be the principal and great thing intended by God, <hi>viz.</hi> the exaltation of Chriſt, and giving of him ſuch tranſcendent glory, onely they confeſſe this glory of Chriſt doth redound for our good; but that which was principally aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at in the Fathers agreement with Chriſt, was the glorious rewarding of him.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, <hi>Though Chriſt was given for us, yet this doth not follow that we were loved more then Chriſt, Becauſe the Father laid no more upon him, then he was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and able to bear.</hi> So that Chriſt conquered all his enemies, neither ſinne nor death were able to over-maſter him, and therefore he was for a ſeaſon under theſe ſufferings, that we might be made happy to all eternity; If indeed the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had left him in a perpetual deſertion, and ſuffered his body to ſee corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for ever, to procure our peace, then it would have followed that he prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red us before his Sonne, but that could not be. What was ordered to befall him, was no more then he could bear, and quickly remove, and therefore Chriſt loſt nothing by becoming our Saviour, and yet we alſo are made happy thereby.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, <hi>Therefore Chriſt was loved more then us, though he died for us, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ultimate end of his death was, that we being redeemed by his death, might acknowledge him our Lord, and for ever live to his praiſe and glory.</hi> So that the ſalvation of believers is but a <hi>proxim and immediate end</hi> of Chriſts death, that which is <hi>ultimate,</hi> that which was <hi>principally</hi> intended, was that we being thus ranſomed, might to all eternity <hi>ſet forth the praiſes and glory of him,</hi> who thus loved us to death.</p>

Oh ſay, and often ſay, Bleſſed Father, is this a little matter for ſuch a poor, weak ſinner, to be taken into the ſame cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot of glory with Chriſt, to have love like his, glory to his, as <hi>Abigail</hi> ſaid to <hi>David,</hi> when he ſent for her to make her his wife, ſhe acknowledged her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs, <hi>Make me one of thy hand-maids</hi> (ſaid ſhe) So, O Lord, if I have a drop of water, a morſel of bread, this is enough for me, but to be taken into fellowſhip with Chriſt, and co-heir with him; This is overflowing, ſupera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding grace, only remember, that here is not only priviledge, but duty al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo; Here lieth a powerfull obligation upon us, to love him with our higheſt and chiefeſt love; let his glory, his love be next to thy heart: Oh be aſhamed that thy love can burn no hotter towards him!</p>
            <p>In the next place, we are to conſider <hi>the ſcope and end</hi> of our Saviour in men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning this preheminent priviledge, and it is, <hi>That the world may know this love.</hi> It's not enough for believers to be thus highly loved by the Father, but the world is to know and to be perſwaded of it.

            <p>
               <pb n="647" facs="tcp:65216:343"/>
               <hi>That it's of great conſequence to the world to know how greatly believers are lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of God.</hi> It would quicken them to many duties,<note place="margin">

Hence 1 <hi>John</hi> 3 1. The Apoſtle cals upon the godly to attend to it, <hi>Behold what manner of love the Father hath beſtowed upon us, that we ſhould be called the ſons of God.</hi> So that under all the hatred and oppoſition of the world, it's neceſſary that this love of God ſhould bear up thy ſoul, though none loveth thee, yet the Father doth. Thus (I ſay) it's neceſſary even for believers themſelves to know how greatly they are beloved, but here our Saviour ſpeaks of the worlds know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and the neceſſity of their being informed therein.</p>

When any natural man ſhall upon theſe convictions argue and reaſon with himſelf, How can he abide any longer in that ſinfull way? Oh then that God would perſwade thee more of this, that thoſe whom thou maligneſt, againſt whom thy heart ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, are ſuch on whom Gods gracious love is fixed, and that it is thou thy ſelf, and ſuch as thou art, that the anger of God abideth on continually, this would quickly make thee another man!

Certainly, they are the choiſeſt and beſt objects upon whom God is pleaſed to caſt his gracious eye, then as <hi>David</hi> ſaid, <hi>My delight is to be with the Saints upon the earth,</hi> Pſal. 16.3. Thus alſo it would be here, when once per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that ſuch are the endeared ones of God, then thy affections, thy heart will be to ſuch alſo.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. <hi>By this perſwaſion upon the heart of the world, that they only are loved of God, hereby the world will ceaſe to hate, and perſecute them, to give them ſuch ill enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment as they do.</hi> When our Saviour poſſeſſeth his Diſciples with that univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal hatred they ſhall have in the world, and that the world cannot do otherwiſe; whence is all this? but becauſe they do not know Chriſt, nor believers neither: But as they took him for an Impoſtor, and one not worthy to live, ſo they do judge his members to be a company of heretiques, not worthy to be ſuffered in the world, and all this malice ariſeth from their blinde hearts, for did they know, who they were as they oppoſe, they dared not to proceed; Even as the Scripture ſaith, <hi>If they had known Chriſt, they would not have crucified the prince of glory,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.6. So that all thy hard words, and thy hard actions, they ariſe from this, thou doſt not know what the godly are, how accepted with God, and how precious to him; for this conſideration would immediately make thee draw in thy arm, thou wouldſt ſee it was a fooliſh thing to ſet againſt ſuch whom God loveth, that it is but kicking againſt the pricks: It's attempting an impoſſible thing, if thou couldſt get God not to love them, then indeed it were ſomething, but as long as God thus loveth them, all thy endeavours againſt them, is as vain
<pb n="648" facs="tcp:65216:344"/>
as <hi>Balacks</hi> was againſt <hi>Iſrael,</hi> No inchantment or divination can prevail: As it's an impoſſible thing, ſo alſo it's dangerous, for ſeeing they are to God as the apple of his eye, and he hath given ſuch a command, even to Kings, that they do not touch his anointed ones; How can it be that God will let all the injuries and offences done againſt them ſo dearly beloved, go free; Therefore perſwade thy ſelf more of this love of God to them, leſt thou incurre Gods foreſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure.</p>
            <p>Again, <hi>It's not only dangerous, but fooliſh alſo, for the more the world ſets againſt believers, the greater their rage is, the more is Gods love drawn out to them.</hi> So that by thy hatred, they do become glorious, and are more eſteemed by God, and receive a greater crown of glory.</p>
            <p>Thus if theſe things be duly conſidered, we muſt needs ſay, it's of great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence for the world to know, that believers are ſo highly loved by God. But in the next place, <hi>It's very difficult for the world to be thus perſwaded.</hi> For</p>
            <p n="1">
               <note place="margin">How difficult it is for the world to be ſo perſwaded.</note>1. <hi>There is naturally an enmity and antipathy of the wicked againſt the godly, and where malice is, they will never believe any good of thoſe whom they hate.</hi> Inſomuch that though God doth with never ſuch a ſignal love demonſtrate himſelf to them, yet they will never be perſwaded ſuch are loved of God; for as they are affected, ſo they judge of God himſelf; and becauſe they think them worthy of all hatred and evil, they conclude, God doth ſo alſo: Thus this diſtemper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed palate judgeth every thing bitter it taſteth.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The love of the Father to believers is chiefly in ſpiritual things, ſuch as Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, Sanctification, Adoption.</hi> Now theſe things are no more apprehended by the world, then curious melody by a deaf ear. The Apoſtle ſpeaketh to this, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.9, 10, 11, 12. admirably ſhewing, That the Spirit of God revealeth theſe ſpiritual things to us, and that without the Spirit, we cannot know the things that are freely given us of God, which he illuſtrateth by a ſimilitude from a man, <hi>As no man can know the things of a man, but a man, ſo neither can a man meerly of himſelf diſcern the things of God.</hi> Hence the <hi>white ſtone,</hi> and the <hi>new Name,</hi> Rev. 2.17. are ſuch things that no man knoweth, but he that hath them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>The world of it ſelf cannot know Gods love to his children, becauſe they have not the experience of it in their own hearts:</hi> And therefore though they may read and hear of ſuch a thing, yet they cannot conceive what it is: As a man that never taſted honey, cannot gueſſe what the ſweetneſſe is: It's the want of this experimental knowledge that makes the world ſo deſpiſe the priviledges of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers; <hi>Balaam</hi> had but a glimpſe of this, and immediately he breaketh out into thoſe wiſhes, <hi>That he might die the death of the righteous, and his latter end might be like his.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, <hi>It's hard for the world to know the Fathers love to the godly, becauſe his outward adminiſtrations are ſo clouded, that by the external events, you would ſometimes judge they were the only people whom God hateth:</hi> Even as it was with Chriſt himſelf, though he was ſolemnly from heaven pronounced to be the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved of his Father, yet in outward conſideration, he was a man of ſorrows and contempt: inſomuch that the Prophet ſaith, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. we thought him ſmitten of God for his ſins, and at his death they inſulted over him, as being forſaken by God.</p>

            </p>
            <p>From the general Connexion of this prayer with the fore-going petitionings, and that prayer-wiſe two things are obſervable,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That without grace here, there is no glory hereafter.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Obſerv.</hi> Without grace here, there is no glory here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That even to the moſt gracious that are, Glory is given by God as a gift obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in prayer.</hi> After they have done all, yet ſtill they muſt pray for it.</p>
            <p>For the former, we ſee that truth eſtabliſhed from the order and method that Chriſt uſeth, having before earneſtly prayed for their Sanctification and Unity in this life, he ſtayeth not there, neither is his love confined within the things of this world, but it extends it ſelf to the world to come, as the chiefeſt of all. As happineſs and glory is the ultimate end of man, concerning which every na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural man miſtakes, ſo grace is the only path that leadeth thereunto, and there is as great a miſtake about grace, what it is, as wherein happineſs doth conſiſt. So that although it be very convenient to diſcover what grace is, and when a man may be ſaid to be godly, yet I ſhall wave that as to a large diſcourſe about it: Only to clear the Doctrine, Conſider,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That by grace, we mean that new creature, or thoſe holy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">What we mean by grace.</note> 
               <hi>divine and ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural principles within a man, whereby he is carried out to work all holineſſe in his life.</hi> For the Scripture deſcribeth this gracious man, ſometimes by that inward work, as the root and foundation of all, ſometimes by the outward fruits of holineſſe, as being the viſible demonſtration of it. So that in the diſcovery of grace, we muſt alwayes attend to theſe two things,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That our religious duties be upon a root deep enough,</hi> that they proceed from a ſupernatural principle within, that no external motive be the only principle to put it into action. And then</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="650" facs="tcp:65216:345"/>2. <hi>That we do not content our ſelves with any ſuppoſed inward work of grace upon the heart, but do accordingly</hi>; as occaſion invites, manifeſt the powerfull efficacy thereof in our lives, for thus the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> declareth Gods promiſe for both, <hi>The writing of his Law in their inward parts,</hi> and making of them <hi>to walk in his wayes,</hi> Ezek. 36.28.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, <hi>Men are very prone generally to delude themſelves in this particular, thinking to obtain glory hereafter, though they have no grace here.</hi> Hence are ſuch exhortations, <hi>Be not deceived,</hi> 1 Cor. 6.9. <hi>No fornicator or idolater ſhall enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Kingdom of heaven,</hi> &amp;c. Who would think the Apoſtle needed to ſet ſuch a prohibition or ſignal mark upon that, for we would think no body could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive himſelf in ſuch a thing notoriouſly known, as that is, yet there is nothing more ordinary, for if all the groſſe viſible ſinners ſhould be asked one by one, Do you hope to obtain eternal happineſſe? he would anſwer with great confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and expectation of it; and yet how groſly and notoriouſly doth he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive himſelf? Is it not as plain, as that he liveth, that ſuch pleaſures of luſts ſhall be rewarded with eternal torments, and yet he hopeth otherwiſe?</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, <hi>Grace here, is not meritorious of glory hereafter.</hi> Rom. 4. <hi>To him that worketh the reward is of debt</hi>; but eternal life is called the <hi>Gift of God</hi>; Our Saviour in this Chapter doth pray for one as well as the other; We may juſtly wonder to ſee how prone men are naturally to look upon grace, as meritorious of glory, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church ſhould ſo confidently maintain it, Doth not all this ariſe, becauſe men are not acquainted with thoſe reliques of corruption, that cleave to the beſt things we do? Certainly, that which is meritorious of hell can never be of heaven, that which deſerveth eternal vengeance, can never procure everlaſting favour; but this proud opinion creepeth ſubtilly into mens hearts under pretence of advancing grace, even while it debaſeth it, for ſo the Papiſt would perſwade us, that they give more to Chriſt then we, becauſe they make him merit, that our grace may be meritorious, inſomuch (that they ſay) we give little or nothing to Chriſt, but to hold, Chriſt merited, that we might merit, is to evacuate the merit of Chriſt, and to make it uſeleſſe, for there need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not any more two meritorious cauſes of ſalvation, then two Suns in the fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament, or elſe if Chriſt merited, as the remote cauſe, and we as the proxime cauſe, then ſalvation is to be attributed more formally to our grace, then Chriſts ſufferings; So that as if the Sunne ſhould inlighten the ſtarres, that they could make the day, this would take off from the immediate glory of the Sun, though that was remotely the cauſe of it; Thus though Chriſt be the cauſe of our grace, yet becauſe our grace is in it ſelf made the meer meritorious cauſe, therefore it would obſcure the glory of Chriſt: Oh then let the gracious man take heed of any proud riſings or ſtirrings of heart, of any proud opinions or doctrins which may ſecretly fermentate him herein.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, <hi>Neither is the connexion between grace and glory cauſal in a phyſical and natural way,</hi> as the fire burneth, or as the acorn will naturally grow into a great Oak. It's ordinarily ſaid, That grace is the ſeed of glory, or grace is glory begun, and glory is grace conſummated; but all this is not ſo to be underſtood, as if grace by any intrinſecal natural vertue did grow up to glory, as a childe doth to a man; No, God might if he had pleaſed, when we had done the higheſt acts of grace, yet have annihilated us; Though we had fought the good fight of faith, yet he might not have given us a crown of glory; for this heavenly glory accompanieth grace only by vertue of a promiſe: Had not God promiſed and mercifully annexed ſuch glorious priviledges, our graces of themſelves could not have procured them.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly, <hi>Therefore is grace and glory connexed partly from the promiſe of God,</hi> He is willing out of his free bounty to beſtow heaven upon our gracious walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſo that we cannot plead our graces, but Gods promiſe onely; neither is

he a debtor unto us, but unto himſelf; and this is the righteouſneſs mentioned by the Scripture, when it ſpeaks of God rewarding us, as when it's ſaid, <hi>If we confeſs and forſake our ſins, he is righteous to forgive them,</hi> 1 Joh. 1.9. and ſo it's juſt with God to remember our ſufferings, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.6. and <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>It's the righteous Judge,</hi> 2 Tim. 4.6. which will <hi>give him the crown of glory.</hi> Here juſtice and righteouſneſs is not mentioned for ſtrict, commutative righteouſneſs, but the righteouſneſs of Gods promiſe and fidelity: So that God looketh upon the promiſe, as on the rainbow, which is a ſure evidence, that he will never deſtroy the world more, and then grace is an antecedent to glory, becauſe <hi>Grace is an ordinable means to glory; Without holineſs no man ſhall ſee God,</hi> Heb. 12.14. Sin cannot in it's nature be appointed the way to happineſs. Therefore the ancient ſaying is, that it is <hi>via,</hi> not <hi>cauſa regni</hi>; ſo that by Gods commanding and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing the way, it's as indiſpenſably neceſſary, as if it were a cauſe. And then</p>
            <p>Laſtly, <hi>It makes for the honour and glory of God, to make grace a neceſſary fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner of glory</hi>; For if every prophane and ungodly perſon might be ſaved, this would redound greatly to Gods diſhonour, this would invert and contradict thoſe places of Scripture, which ſpeak of Gods purity and holineſs, ſo that <hi>his eyes cannot behold the wicked</hi> that <hi>he will in no wiſe acquit the ungodly,</hi> Exod. 34.7. That he is <hi>angry with the wicked all the day long,</hi> Pſal. 7.11. Thus you ſee, that there is an inviolable chain between ſanctification and happineſs, and that it is groſs and foul preſumption, for a man to ſeparate theſe two, to think he ſhall ever partak of one, without exerciſing the other, and therefore this</p>

Will God turn the day into night, or the night into day? Will he make the Sun ſtand ſtill, or the waters of the Sea part aſunder to pleaſe the creature?

            <p>And ſo I proceed to the ſecond Doctrine, Chriſt prayeth, <hi>That believers, though thus ſanctified and perfected in one, may be made glorious.</hi> Now this plainly ſuppoſeth,</p>

               <hi>The gift of God</hi>; So that here is a difference between hell and heaven; The wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked mans life deſerveth hell, it's the proper reward of every ungodly action, yea ſome ſay, that hell is leſſe then the ſin, God doth not puniſh according to the deſert of it, but it's otherwiſe with glory and happineſs, for after we have done to the utmoſt, yet it's wholly in Gods good pleaſure, whether he will give a Kingdom or no. Now the Reaſons, <hi>Why eternal glory muſt be a gift even to the moſt godly men,</hi> is</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Becauſe that all our beſt actions have ſome ſinfulneſs cleaving to them, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that if God ſhould deal ſtrictly according to thoſe adhering defects, we might be damned, notwithſtanding the graces we have.</hi> Therefore the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> prayeth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 143.2. <hi>That God would not enter into judgement with his ſervant, becauſe in his ſight no fleſh ſhould be juſtified.</hi> Though <hi>David</hi> was Gods ſervant, and that after his own heart, yet he could not be juſtified, and ſo not ſaved, unleſs God did graciouſly forgive what was imperfect: Oh then how greatly ſhould this humble us, when we ſhall conſider we never did any thing in our lives, though in the moſt holy manner, but it needed a pardon, as <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> when he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned the many particulars he had done for God, and deſired to be remembred for them, yet added alſo, that he might be ſpared, and have mercy ſhewed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 13.22.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>It's the gift of God, becauſe any gracious action is ſo farre from making a man to merit at Gods hand, that he is thereby the more obliged and bound to God.</hi> So that the more holy he is, the leſſe he can deſerve, becauſe in that he is the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted unto God: So that it is abſurd to think, that becauſe God hath heaped more mercies upon us, that therefore ſtill we deſerve more, but rather to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that both grace here, and glory hereafter, is wholly from the gift of God.</p>

            <head>SERMON CXXXIV. Of immediate Enjoyment of, and Communion with Chriſt in Heaven, as the Complement of mans happineſſe.</head>
            <epigraph>
               <bibl>JOH. 17.24.</bibl>
               <q>Father, I will that they alſo whom thou haſt given me be with me where I am.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THE next thing conſiderable is the object matter of this Petition, which is two-fold.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>To be where Chriſt is.</hi> 2. <hi>To behold the glory</hi> which the Father had given him.</p>
            <p>Let us Conſider the firſt particular, <hi>To be with Chriſt where Chriſt is,</hi> and <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi> doth well obſerve, that he doth not pray, <hi>They may be where he is,</hi> for though a man be wretched and miſerable he is <hi>where Chriſt is,</hi> but not <hi>with Christ,</hi> as (ſaith he) a blinde man may be where the light is but not with the light: It's therefore added, <hi>to be with him where Chriſt is,</hi> and that denoteth the gracious and happy enjoyment of him: Some underſtand it of Chriſts gracious preſence here vouchſafed to beleevers, but the context doth more genuinely comprehend the former; For our Suviour was now to be no longer in this world, and beſides the expreſſion of being with God and Chriſt in the Scripture-ſence is proper to that eternal felicity and glory, which they are made partakers of, only the doubt may be if it be underſtood of glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous preſence with Chriſt, why Chriſt ſpeaks in the <hi>preſent tenſe, where I am</hi>: Some anſwer, that this is to be underſtood in reſpect of his divine nature, by which he was alwaies glorious; Others underſtand it ſpoken in the preſent, becauſe he was very immediatly to be glorified every way, and then it may well be received; There are ſome who make this Argument, that this muſt be underſtood of a glorious preſence, not a gracious, becauſe (ſay they) of a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious preſence the phraſe alwaies is, God is with us, but of a glorious preſence We are with God,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Obſerv.</hi> The greateſt part of our happineſſe that we ſhall have in heaven lies in this, that then we ſhall be with Chriſt, and have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the Lord.</note> but though this may be admitted as the moſt common ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, yet ſome few inſtances may be ſhewed to the contrary; Therefore the former Reaſons eſpecially if we adde the words following, <hi>That they may behold my glory,</hi> which ſeem to be exegeticall of what went before, will evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that we muſt underſtand the ſence of that happy eternall preſence with Chriſt in heaven.</p>
            <p>Obſ. <hi>That the greateſt part of our glory and happineſſe, which we ſhall have in heaven, lieth in this, that then we ſhall be with Chriſt, and have immediate Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the Lord</hi>; Though we are apt to look upon the happineſſe of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as it freeth from all pains and torments, as it delivers us from the curſe and vengeance of God, yet that which is indeed the ſublime and chief part of
<pb n="654" facs="tcp:65216:347"/>
our happineſſe, is that we ſhall there have an immediate enjoyment of God and Chriſt; It's aſſerted as a Truth, that the greateſt miſery in hell is in the <hi>poena damni,</hi> not in the <hi>poena ſenſus,</hi> and <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> conſidering that dreadfull Sentence pronounced, <hi>Depart ye curſed into everlasting fire,</hi> makes theſe words <hi>depart</hi> to be farre more terrible then <hi>eternall fire</hi>; The doctrine of heaven and hell was not ſo fully and evidently preached in the Old Teſtament as in the New, yet even then we have <hi>David</hi> thus breaking forth into an holy paſſion, <hi>Whom have I in heaven but thee, and whom in earth in compariſon of thee?</hi> Pſal. 73.25. <hi>Whom in heaven but thee,</hi> implying, that heaven would not be heaven if God were not there, and that in heaven he looketh not to Angels or Saints there but God himſelf; Now though the happineſſe of heaven be deſcribed from other particulars, yet that this is the ſum of all may appear from theſe two places, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.23. where you finde <hi>Paul</hi> in a divine perplexity and heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtreight whether he ſhould deſire <hi>to live or die,</hi> and although for the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es good he is contented to live, yet abſolutely and ſimply his deſire was to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patt, and why? becauſe this was <hi>to be with Chriſt, which is farre better</hi>; So then this was that which ſo moved <hi>Paul</hi> to be no longer in this world, <hi>viz to be with Chriſt</hi>; No doubt <hi>Paul</hi> had many godly Friends, in ſeeing whoſe faces and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying their company he took great delight, and this he often expreſſeth, but all theſe are nothing to Chriſts Company; Thus to godly hearts, though it be a great comfort to enjoy their Wives and Children, yet when raiſed by grace they can preferre the company of Chriſt above all. The ſecond place is 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 47. when the Apoſtle in a divine and raviſhing manner had treated on the Reſurrection, then he mentioneth this as the ſumme and Complement of all our felicity, <hi>that we ſhall be with the Lord for ever</hi>; To be with the Lord, and to be with him for ever comprehends ſo much that the heart can never ſuck out all the honey of it.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Of immediate communion with Chriſt in heaven Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der theſe things.</note>But let us not with <hi>Moſes</hi> ſtand afar off and behold the glory and ſweetneſs of this Land, but let us enter into it, and theſe things are conſiderable.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> Firſt, <hi>That we deny not but the happineſſe of Heaven may be amplified from ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall other particulars beſides our preſence with Chriſt,</hi> ſuch as the <hi>enjoying of Angels and Saints,</hi> for a ſtate of happineſſe is the aggregation of all good thing deſirable, but yet that which is the Sun among the Stars, <hi>That which is the principall and great happineſſe is that we ſhall then more perfectly know and enjoy God and Chriſt</hi>; It's true indeed moſt Divines do yield that we ſhall there know our godly Friends, and ſhall greatly rejoyce in their ſalvation and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe, yet ſo that all theſe lines will meet in God as the center, that all theſe ſtreams will be emptied into the Ocean, ſo that though Heaven hath unſpeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble priviledges, and every thing therein is glorious, yet that which is the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of this heaven, the glory of this glory is the enjoyment of Chriſt himſelf; It's Gods preſence that makes heaven to be heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> Secondly, We are to know that the Schoolmen whom Divines follow ſpeak of a twofold happineſſe, <hi>beatitudo objectiva,</hi> and <hi>formalis,</hi> an objective happineſs, and this is acknowledged to be only God himſelf; There is no other object that can make the ſoul happy but God only; As the ſtars cannot diſpell darkneſſe, and make light but the Sun only; The other is called <hi>beatitudo formalis</hi> or <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectiva,</hi> and that is the internal perfecting of all the faculties of the ſoul with ſuch perfect grace that they are able to carry us to God in a moſt perfect man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and the glorifying of the body with all thoſe admirable qualities that the Scripture ſpeaks of, ſo that when we ſay Chriſt in heaven is our happineſſe, we ſpeak of the <hi>objective happineſſe</hi> not the <hi>formall,</hi> That object in the enjoyment whereof, the glorified Saint is made eternally happy, is Chriſt only.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> Thirdly, <hi>Conſider that even in this life we are with Chriſt, and Chriſt is with us</hi>; Though (as you heard) to be with Chriſt is moſt commonly the expreſſion
<pb n="655" facs="tcp:65216:347"/>
of glory, yet it may ſometimes denote our gracious preſence here, for thus, though Chriſt be in Heaven, yet he is ſaid to <hi>dwell in our hearts by Faith,</hi> Eph. 3. Therefore we muſt needs in this life be with him, now this is the beginning of that glory we ſhall have hereafter, <hi>He that beleeveth, hath Eternal life,</hi> Joh. 3. not only <hi>de jure,</hi> but doth actually poſſeſſe ſome beginnings of it; The Transfiguration <hi>Peter</hi> was in, and the extaſie <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of were forerunners of Heaven, and although the godly may not have ſuch an extaticall raviſhing ſence of it, yet the Lord doth many times beſtow on his people a taſte of this joy whereby they rejoyce with joy unſpeakable and full of glory, whereby they are above the world, and can deſpiſe all earthly comforts comparatively; <hi>Auſtin</hi> and <hi>Bernard</hi> do ſometimes ſpeak their experience of this upon their ſouls, and no doubt but the Martyrs who were to ſuffer ſo bitterly for Chriſt, were had up into the Mount of Transfiguration before they were carried to Mount <hi>Calvary, Crus nihil ſentit in ligno, quando animus eſt in coelo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the next place let us Conſider the Grounds why Chriſt or Gods preſence in heaven is that which makes the happineſſe of a glorified beleever.<note place="margin">The grounds why Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is that which makes the happineſſe of a glorified beleever.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> And 1. <hi>Becauſe in Chriſt or God there is all fulneſſe to make us happy,</hi> he is <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectively</hi> all what the ſoul can deſire; If Chriſt be repreſented in this life <hi>all</hi> to the Church, when yet we have but the glimpſes of him, how much more in Heaven when we ſhall have the full enjoyment of him; Therefore wonder not if having of God there be our happineſſe, for he is the univerſal good, he is that <hi>bonum in quo omnia bona,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid having a Revelation from God, this was enough, and that thoſe who were pillars could not adde unto him, ſo much more may it be ſaid in this caſe, having full poſſeſſion of the Lord Chriſt himſelf, no comfort or content any other way can adde one cubite to that ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of happineſſe.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. Chriſt is not only <hi>objectively</hi> full of that which may make happy, <hi>but he is alſo efficiently communicative of it,</hi> For ſuppoſe God be a Fountain ſufficient and inexhauſted, yet as long as it is a Fountain ſealed up, as long as there is a ſtone upon the mouth of it that cannot be rolled away, ſo long we are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to come at any refreſhment; God is alwaies able to make us happy to the utmoſt, he might vouchſafe us an heaven in this world, but he is a free Agent, and communicateth himſelf as he pleaſeth; Now it hath pleaſed him while we are in this life to communicate himſelf by degrees; This Fountain is diſpenſed by drops, but in Heaven there will God communicate himſelf as far as the creature is able to receive him: Then this Sun will not be under any Cloud, then there will not be any complaints why the Lord doth hide his face or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw himſelf.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3 <hi>Heavens happineſſe lieth in Chriſt, becauſe then the ſoul is made a prepared and ſutable ſubject for him</hi>; All pleaſure and delight ariſeth from the convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the object with the faculty, for if there be contrariety or diſſonancy then inſtead of happineſs, there is nothing but miſery; Now in Heaven the the whole ſoul will be ſo perfected with Grace that it cannot delight in any thing but ſuch an holy God: What is the reaſon that in this life a wicked man hateth God, and refuſeth his will and law, but becauſe of his contrariety to him, and on the other ſide a godly man though he have but imperfect and inchoate grace, yet he preferreth Chriſt, and loveth him before Father and Mother, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing that is dear, all this ariſeth becauſe there is ſome ſimilitude between God and him, he is born of God, and partakes of the divine Nature, and ſo by this means delighteth and rejoyceth in God, but if the green Tree be thus rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to burn in love with God, what ſhall the dry Tree do?</p>
            <p n="4">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 4. Chriſt is the chiefeſt happineſſe in Heaven, becauſe he being chiefly belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, there is obtained the neareſt Union with him: It's not the place of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven but the perſon in Heaven that a Chriſtians love is fixed upon; Hence ſome
<pb n="656" facs="tcp:65216:348"/>
ſome have not been afraid to ſay, That Chriſt with a godly man though in hell yet would make hell no hell, for when the ſoul cometh to enjoy that which is moſt beloved, then all further deſires and diſtractions muſt ceaſe, then the ſtone is come to its center; Then the fire of love hath aſcended as high as it can go, then it ſaith <hi>Sufficit, I have enough</hi>; Now all the while the Church is on Earth ſhe conflicts with deſires after Chriſt, hence are thoſe vehement Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>Come Lord Jeſus, come quickly, The Spirit and Bride ſay Come,</hi> Rev. 22.17, 20. If then theſe deſires be turned into actuall enjoyments, and it's no longer <hi>Come Lord Jeſus,</hi> but <hi>he is come,</hi> then there muſt needs be all matter of joy and rejoycing, he that drinketh of this living water in this life ſhall never thirſt more, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. viz. <hi>with a total thirſt,</hi> So as to be weary of Chriſt and deſire ſome other Object, how much rather will this be true in Heaven; Then it's impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be weary, to be deſirous of ſomething elſe beſides God, for there love is joyned to the Object as fully and as nearly as poſſibly it can be; As Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers ſay the matter of the Heavens deſireth no other form, whereas in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunary things it conſtantly doth, and all becauſe of the actuality and perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that form, Thus it muſt be with the glorified Saints in Heaven, They can never be glutted, never complain, as they did of Manna by the conſtant uſe of it, but God is as richly, as delightſomely enjoyed by every Saint in Heaven to all Eternity as at the very firſt entrance into Heaven.</p>
            <p>But you will ſay, May not I then deſire Heaven as a place of happineſſe? Is it hypocriſie and inſincerity to deſire that ſtate of glory? Muſt it be Chriſt only there? The Anſwer is, That is in the principall and firſt place to be deſired, but yet ſecondarily Heaven as it is our happineſſe and our glory may be fought af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for which many Texts might be brought.</p>
            <p>

            <p>ETernal glory (we heard) our Saviour prayed for all thoſe that ſhould believe in him, which is expreſſed thus indefinitely, <hi>To be with Chriſt, where he is</hi>; He doth not name the place, becauſe this is it which makes heaven to be heaven, that we do enjoy Chriſt there</p>
            <p>From this we proceed to other things conſiderable. As</p>

The <hi>Compellation, Father.</hi> This our Saviour uſeth three times, as being a name denoting the moſt intimate and ſweet relation, as alſo cauſing the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt confidence, why Chriſt cals God Father, hath been diſcuſſed already againſt <hi>Socinian</hi> gloſſes; he is not a Father to Chriſt in the ſame manner, as he is to believers, neither did Chriſt uſe this Title, to ſubdue and overcome any unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving and doubting thoughts in him, or to quicken up his confidence, which otherwiſe might fail, but hereby to demonſtrate the near relation between them, as alſo his dependance upon him. So that from Chriſts example herein, we may obſerve,</p>

               <hi>That it is a neceſſary duty in a Chriſtian in his approaches to God,</hi>

                  <hi>Doct.</hi> It is a neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry duty in a Chriſtian, in his approaches to God, to think on thoſe attributes and relations in him, which may excite and ſtirre up holy confindence and boldneſſe.</note> 
               <hi>to think on thoſe attributes and relations in him, which may excite and ſtir up holy confidence and boldneſs.</hi> When we come unto God, we are to draw nigh to him, as our heavenly Father, whoſe bowels do exceed all parents affections in the world, if they were put together: Therefore it is our Saviour in that rule of prayer, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects to that title and compellation of a <hi>Father.</hi>

It's blaſphemy for ſuch prophane wretches to ſay to God, <hi>Thou art my Father.</hi> The Scripture tels us, <hi>That ſuch are of their Father the Devil:</hi> See then if the Devil thy father will bleſs thee, if he will make thee happy: Oh that wicked men would but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, what a wofull condition it is to lie in, that they cannot pray, that they cannot call God <hi>Father!</hi> Thou doeſt but blaſpheme with thy tongue all the while, what God, the God of wicked and prophane enemies to him? No, he is a Judge, and a conſuming fire to all ſuch.</p>

Doth he not argue againſt it from the ſeveral corruptions that are in his ſoul? Oh how can this, and this be in me, if God be my Father! As alſo from the many ſad afflictions and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes he meeteth with more then others; If God were my Father, would he thus break and bruiſe me, more then many in the world, making me the Butt againſt which all his arrows are delivered? So that you ſee it's neceſſary to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the ſpirit againſt this temptation, which doth ſo naturally breed in the heart of a tender Chriſtian: Inſomuch that to call God Father cordially, and upon ſincere grounds, is a great mercy.</p>

You ſee the devil working with this engine upon Chriſt himſelf, knowing this was to ſet the axe to the root of the tree, <hi>If thou be the Son of God do thus,</hi> he would have him put that to the trial, and is not the devil ſtill ſuggeſting this unto thee, if thou be the Sonne of God, then it would be thus and thus with thee? Gods children never do as thou doeſt: Now this temptation hath ſo farre prevailed by Satans inſtigation upon ſome of Gods people, that they have wholly given over to pray, that they dared not to preſume to pray; And why? becauſe God is not their Father, they may no more pray, then the damned in hell; So that the godly man is left in a wofull deſolate eſtate, all the while this truth doth not reign in his heart, that God is his Father.</p>

Oh that I could delight in him as a Father! But now when this Spirit of Adoption cometh into our hearts, ſee with what efficacy and power it cometh, it maketh us <hi>to cry,</hi> that denoteth earneſtneſs, vehemency, and alſo confidence, undauntedneſs, notwithſtanding the roaring cries of the devil and conſcience to the contrary; and thus it enableth us to <hi>cry, Abba, Father,</hi> by way of ingemination, implying, that it is not once, but twice, yea often; for indeed if the Spirit of God did not conſtantly thus keep up a filial frame, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry new failing would caſt us back into a meer darkneſſe and confuſion: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Spirit of God hath this office of being a <hi>Comforter,</hi> becauſe we of our ſelves cannot ſow that ſeed in our own ſouls.</p>

               <hi>That Chriſts prayer for his people, will certainly and infallibly prevail for them.

            <p n="1">1. <hi>Becauſe he hath merited and purchaſed at Gods hands thoſe benefits he prayeth for.</hi> Therefore though whatſoever God doth to us, be of grace in reſpect of us, yet it is of juſtice and right to him; ſo that it can no more be, that Chriſts prayer for us ſhould not ſpeed, then that God ſhould be unjuſt, and that not in reſpect of promiſe only to Chriſt, for he hath likewiſe promiſed to us, but of juſtice: So that now Chriſt may well ſay, Father, I will their glory and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, becauſe I have purchaſed it at ſo dear a rate.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Chriſts prayer muſt needs be effectual, becauſe it lieth in his power alſo to do that, and accompliſh for us, which he doth deſire.</hi> Though therefore as man he prayeth, yet as God he can fulfill and bring about what we ſtand in need of: If therefore Chriſt ſaith, Father I will that they be ſanctified, that they be glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, who ſhall withſtand this?</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Chriſts prayer will alwayes take effect, becauſe his will, and the will of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are the ſame.</hi> So that as Chriſt argued, <hi>None could take his ſheep out of his hand, becauſe he and the Father are one</hi>; So alſo it followeth, Chriſts will in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er cannot be gainſaid or hindred by any, becauſe the Father and he are one; if indeed the Father had one will, and Chriſt a contrary will to it, then we might juſtly doubt of the ſucceſſe of it, but it is not, as Chriſt wils the Sanctification and glorification of his people, ſo doth the Father alſo; So that all our confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is to be in Chriſts prayer, and not ours.</p>

in Chriſt</hi>; We reade of Chriſt in praier, how that in a wonderfull Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figuration his <hi>face did ſhine,</hi> Mat. 17.2. <hi>like the Sun,</hi> here was great glory, but yet it's nothing to Chriſts glory hereafter: yea, we reade of <hi>Moſes</hi> his face, that it did ſhine with ſuch glory that the people could not behold it, Therefore a veil was put upon his face, But in heaven there the glory of Chriſt will tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend all theſe, and there will be no need of a Veil, for we ſhall be enabled to behold it: Now this glory of Chriſt in heaven is</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That eſſential glory which he hath as God,</hi> This he never laid aſide no more then his God-head, but as the Sun in a dark gloomy day may not ſend forth its glorious beams; Thus the Lord Chriſt while here upon the earth ſubject to many infirmities, had that divine glory covered for a while, otherwiſe he could not have been in a capacity to ſuffer for us, but when in heaven then all thoſe infirmities are laid aſide, Then the body of Chriſt will not hinder the breaking forth of all his divine glory, This glory then of Chriſt will be manifeſtly ſet forth, for in heaven doth God put forth his more immediate glory.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Chriſts Mediatory glory</hi> will then alſo be manifeſted, for though Chriſt as God had right to all the glory in heaven, yet he did upon a new and diſtinct ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle acquire this glory to himſelf, whether indeed this great name given him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all names in heaven and earth being lifted up above all principalities and powers was as an effect or conſequent only of his foregoing humiliation is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted, as alſo what this Mediatory glory is, and whether diſtinct from divine is much debated by the Learned; But this is ſure, the Scripture ſpeaks clearly of a wonderfull great Majeſty and power expreſſed by ſitting at Gods right hand vouchſafed unto Chriſt after his reſurrection, Now all this glory we ſhall be made beholders of.</p>

            <p>THere remain two things more obſervable in this Petition, whereof one is, <hi>the efficient cauſe of that glory,</hi> which we are conſtantly to behold in heaven. The other is, <hi>the ſubject for whom</hi> he thus ſupplicateth, both which we ſhall diſpatch at this time. And</p>
            <p>Firſt of the Deſcription of Chriſts glory, from the <hi>Authour of it,</hi> which is <hi>God the Father,</hi> from whom he hath it by way of gift. I ſhall not be long on this, becauſe I have already ſpoken much to it: Only the Doubt is, <hi>What glory it is, that here is ſaid to be given by the Father?</hi> and without any further ingaging into controverſies, we may fully conclude, <hi>That it is of his glory as Mediator</hi>; and if you ask, <hi>How is that ſaid to be already given him, when he had not yet ſuffered, and ſo had not entered into glory?</hi> The anſwer is, either that <hi>the Father had given it him</hi> in reſpect of <hi>his decree</hi> to give; in which ſenſe learned men ſay, the word <hi>(give)</hi> is uſed ſometimes in this Chapter, or elſe he had it actually given <hi>in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of right and title,</hi> even before his Reſurrection. Or</p>
            <p>Laſtly, It is ſaid to be <hi>already given,</hi> becauſe he was <hi>immediately to poſſeſſe his glory</hi>; for thus before in the Chapter, he was ſaid to be no longer in this world, becauſe he was preſently to leave it: So here the <hi>glory which thou haſt given me,</hi> becauſe he was preſently to be made partaker of it.

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>out this point.</p>
               </note> This appeareth by Chriſts prayer in this Chapter to the Father, that he would glorifie him, as alſo by other Texts, plainly affirming this to be given him, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.9. <hi>God hath highly exalted him, and given him a Name,</hi> &amp;c. So <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.18. <hi>All power is given me in heaven and earth,</hi> and in many other places. Now it cannot be denied but the Doctrine of Chriſts mediatory glory, and the manner of obtaining it, is full of difficulty, inſomuch that it hath greatly exerciſed the thoughts of the learned; but I ſhall not lanch into the deeps of it, becauſe it is here occaſionally ſpoken of.<note place="margin">Chriſt as God cannot have any thing gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him, unleſs by way of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation and external cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration.</note> I ſhall only declare ſome particulars that may clear the truth. And</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> Firſt, <hi>Chriſt, as God, cannot have any thing given unto him in time, unleſſe it be by way of manifeſtation and external celebration by the creature.</hi> Thus God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is ſaid to have honour and glory, and worſhip from the creature; thus his Name is ſaid to be glorified, not that Gods infinite perfection is capable of any new advantage, which he had not alwayes, only here is a declaration and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement
<pb n="666" facs="tcp:65216:353"/>
of this by the creatures, and this conſideration ſhould greatly humble us in our beſt and choiceſt ſervices, we have not made God more happy, or bleſſed thereby, neither doth he need our ſervices, only it is for our good; as when the eye ſeeth the Sun, or the thirſty traveller drinketh of the fountain, the Sun or ſpring are not helped thereby, but our infirmities refreſhed.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Obj.</hi>
               </note>And if it be objected, <hi>That the humane nature was given Chriſt as God, and he had not this from all eternity, neither was this by declaration only; Therefore ſomething may be given Chriſt as God,</hi> de novo, <hi>which he had not from all eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> Several things may be ſaid to this, eſpecially theſe two:</p>
            <p n="1">
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi>
               </note>1. <hi>That nothing can be given to Chriſt as God, which he himſelf doth not give himſelf:</hi> And therefore if any creature, men or Angels could have given him ſomething of themſelves, this would have argued imperfection; but it was Chriſt as God that did aſſume this humane nature to himſelf: Therefore <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. God is ſaid to <hi>become man, and to dwell amongst us</hi>; ſo he is ſaid, <hi>to take not upon him the nature of Angels, but the ſeed of Abraham</hi>; Therefore what is given him is given by himſelf. But yet</p>
            <p>Secondly, and more fully, <hi>The humane Nature was indeed aſſumed by the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, but not to any intrinſecal perfection of the God-head, but to make perfect the humane Nature.</hi> So that we cannot ſo properly ſay, The humane Nature was given to Chriſt as God, as that the divine Nature aſſumed the humane Nature, not neceſſarily, but voluntarily, not out of indigence, but bounty, not becauſe it was to be perfected thereby, but to perfect the humane Nature.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> Secondly, <hi>Christ as Mediator might have ſomething beſtowed and given upon him by the Father.</hi> For although as Mediator he muſt neceſſarily be God alſo, yet becauſe (to be Mediator) doth imply a compound, as it were, <hi>viz.</hi> God-man; Therefore in that reſpect, he is capable by way of gift of that which otherwiſe abſolutely as God, he could not receive, and in this reſpect, <hi>as Mediator,</hi> he ſtill acknowledgeth, <hi>He received his Doctrine from the Father,</hi> that it was from the free love and goodneſs of God to appoint him to be a Mediator. Now of all the gifts, which the Scripture ſpeaks of, as moſt eminently and ſignally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon him, is that glory and exaltation he was lifted up into after he had been in a ſtate of humiliation. This the Scripture doth often inculcate; but here is ſome Doubt about the explication of this,
<q>For the <hi>Socinians</hi> denying Chriſt to be eſſentially God,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Doubt.</hi>
                  </note> do affirm, That this glory became due unto him, only upon his obedience unto death, and that upon ſuch perfect obedience, then, and not before, God appointed and conſtituted him God and Lord, gave him this high excellent glory, commanding men and Angels to worſhip him with the ſame religious worſhip, that God himſelf is to be worſhipped.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sol.</hi>
               </note>But this is fully againſt Scripture, which as it makes him God while on earth, ſo alſo King and Lord of all, although after his death, he came to a fuller poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of this glory, he was alwayes King and Head of the Church, having a right to all glory, but yet did not actually receive it, but in ſuch a method and order God had appointed.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Doubt.</hi>
               </note>The other Doubt is about the Orthodox themſelves, <hi>Whether Chriſt did merit this glory for himſelf, or no?</hi> Some eminent Divines do wholly deny it, making his glory only the conſequent of his humiliation, not the reward of it merited by the Lord Chriſt.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sol.</hi>
               </note> But there ſeemeth no danger in, yea there appeareth ſome neceſſity of affirming, <hi>That Chriſt merited his own glory as well as ours</hi>; Not but that as God he had a right to all glory, only the ſame glory was due unto him upon a two-fold title, 1. By natural inheritance, as it were being the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly begotten Son of God: And ſecondly, by purchaſe and conqueſt: Even as <hi>Joaſh</hi> obtained his Kingdom, partly by his natural right, and partly by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt ſubduing <hi>Athaliah,</hi> who unjuſtly detained the Kingdom from him. This Mediatory glory then was both a gift, and a reward unto Chriſt, although even
<pb n="667" facs="tcp:65216:353"/>
all this glory that Chriſt is inveſted with, doth alſo redound to our good and glory.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> Thirdly, From this glory that is thus given to him, as Mediator, ariſeth a fervent diſpute amongſt Divines, <hi>Whether Chriſt, as Mediator,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Doubt.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>be to be adored with religious worſhip?</hi> But</p>
            <p n="1">1. This is confeſſed by the Orthodox againſt the <hi>Socinians,</hi> That Chriſt is by Nature the true God, which they prove from religious worſhip given unto him,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sol.</hi>
               </note> for we are commanded to believe him, therefore in him alſo are we to worſhip; inſomuch that the <hi>Socinians are guilty of high Idolatry (let them mince the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter never ſo much) while they give religious worſhip to Chriſt, and yet profeſs him to be a meer man.</hi> But now the <hi>Socinians</hi> to overthrow this,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Socinians</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.</note> argue in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, <hi>He that is worſhipped with a divine worſhip, as he is Mediator, is not worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped as God: But Chriſt is worſhipped as Mediator.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In anſwering of this Objection, The Orthodox go ſeveral wayes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <note place="margin">Anſwered.</note> Some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the <hi>minor,</hi> viz. That Chriſt is not to be religiouſly adored, as Mediator, though they acknowledge that even to Chriſts humane Nature there is due ſome vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration inferiour to the divine: But we may well enough grant the Propoſition true, <hi>That Chriſt, as Mediator, is to be adored with divine worſhip, becauſe as he is Mediator he muſt neceſſarily be God, and ſo therein is included the</hi> ratio formalis ſub quà <hi>of all religious worſhip:</hi> So that to be worſhipped as Mediator, and as God, <hi>are not oppoſite, but one is neceſſarily included in the other.</hi> For that ſuch a religious invocation of Chriſt, as Mediator is lawfull, appeareth by that prayer of <hi>Stephen, Lord Jeſus receive my ſpirit,</hi> Act. 7.59.</p>
            <p>The <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> may be of <hi>Inſtruction</hi>; Doth God the Father thus exalt and glorifie Chriſt? Was this his purpoſe from all eternity thus to have him magnified for ever? Then let it be our conſtant work, and the daily imploiment of our ſoul, to give him all honour and praiſe: Oh let us be aſhamed more, that we have not honoured Chriſt as he ought to be! Whom <hi>Ahaſhuerus</hi> would have honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, all the people were ready to bow unto; how much rather then ought we to glorifie the Lord Chriſt, whom the Father doth therefore exalt, becauſe by his ſufferings we are alſo glorified. Now we may glorifie him three wayes:<note place="margin">How many wayes we may glorifie Chriſt.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Doctrinally,</hi> by maintaining all thoſe true opinions that advance him in his Nature, Offices, and all operations for us; For he that denieth any of his <hi>Natures</hi> or his <hi>Offices,</hi> or his <hi>works</hi> for us, he doth greatly rob Chriſt of his glory, and how buſie hath the devil been in all ages, thus to diſhonour Chriſt, becauſe by this means the Head and the foundation of the Church is endanger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which proveth mortal to the Church; <hi>Socinians</hi> deſtroy one of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, Papiſts obſcure his Offices: ſo that in very few Churches is Chriſt ſet up in all his glory.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Chriſts glory is to be cordially in thy heart, and orally in thy mouth</hi>; Oh what inlarged affections and raviſhment of ſoul did <hi>Paul</hi> ſhew, when he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions Chriſt, he ſpeaks of him, as the compleat perfection of a Chriſtian, <hi>Who is made righteouſneſſe, wiſdome and all things,</hi> and therefore this is the character of thoſe that are ſpiritual, <hi>They have no confidence in the fleſh, and rejoyce in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> Phil. 3.3.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, <hi>We glorifie Chriſt really in our lives and converſations, when we walk as Members ſutably to the Head, when we order our converſations anſwerably to the rule of the Goſpel.</hi> For how often do wicked men reproach and diſhonour Chriſt by their ungodly lives, as if Chriſt taught them no better, or as if Chriſt died not to deliver us from all ungodly and ſinfull luſts? Therefore on the other ſide, then we honour Chriſt, when we are holy as he was, zealous as he was, humble and meek as he was, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>He carried the marks of Chriſt upon his body,</hi> ſo do thou the graces of Chriſt upon thy ſoul.</p>
            <p>We come in the next place to a brief deſcription of <hi>the ſubject deſcribed,

Though this be true, yet we muſt adde, that in reſpect of thoſe who were to believe, ſo it's a decree of giving, but in reſpect of the Apoſtles and others who did then believe, it was an actual giving, Now whereas we ſee the original and fountain of all grace formerly prayed for, and now all glory here is, becauſe ſome are given to Chriſt by the Father, we may obſerve,</p>

            <p>THis laſt clauſe is brought in as a Reaſon of that which went before, Some make it a Reaſon of Chriſts Petition, why the Father ſhould hear him, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe he alwaies loved him, and ſo nothing could be denied to him; others referre it to the gift of Glory mentioned im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly; The Father gave Chriſt glory becauſe he loved him from Eternity, but theſe do not oppoſe, but may include one another: The only doubt is, <hi>In what ſenſe the Father is ſaid to love Chriſt before the Foundation of the world</hi>; Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny underſtand it of Chriſt as the natural and only Son of God; That as he had alwaies the ſame glory with the Father, ſo likewiſe he was alwaies loved of him, and from hence they prove the Deity of Chriſt; But <hi>Calvin</hi> and others expound it of <hi>Chriſt as Mediatour</hi>; That the Father did love him from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, in appointing of him to be a Mediatour, and preparing him thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, Now this ſeemeth the more genuine Interpretation, and doth not exclude but include the former alſo, So that by direct conſequence the eternal god-head of Chriſt is aſſerted; Indeed <hi>Piſcator</hi> referreth thoſe words (<hi>before the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world</hi>) to the verb <gap reason="foreign">

            <p n="1">1. Let us conſider <hi>wherein the love of the Father was ſhewed to Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="1">1. <hi>In appointing and ordaining the ſecond perſon as the only begotten of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to come into the world and take our nature upon him</hi>; For herein did the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther love the Son, becauſe when mankinde was loſt, and juſtice could no waies be ſatisfied by any meer creature, that in this exigency Chriſt ſhould offer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and ſo readily profeſſe, <hi>Behold, I come to do thy will O Lord</hi>; Thus when he formerly had ſaid, <hi>I ſanctifie my ſelf,</hi> that doth not ſolely relate to his humane
<pb n="670" facs="tcp:65216:355"/>
nature but even his divine alſo, becauſe the ſecond perſon was in a peculiar manner ſent into the world, and to become man for us.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Fathers love was more remarkably ſeen towards that particular hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature which the ſecond perſon aſſumed, <hi>in the ſanctifying and glorifying of that with all ſutableneſſe,</hi> and thus the love of God was to the humane nature of Chriſt before the Foundation of the world by way of purpoſe and decree in God, even as it is to all the Elect Children of God, for Chriſt attributeth i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to God the Father, that he had ſo fitted his humane nature, Therefore he ſaith, <hi>a body thou haſt prepared me,</hi> Heb. 10.5. Now ſeverall waies did the Fathers love appear herein, as 1. to ordain and appoint him to be a Mediatour, to make him man for this purpoſe; This is attributed wholly to God the Father, hence 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.20. Chriſt is ſaid to be <hi>fore-ordained before the foundation of the world</hi>; Chriſt coming into the world was not of meer neceſſity, There was no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion to this, but the Father out of his meer good pleaſure did thus ordain him; Hence it is, that our Saviour doth conſtantly make the Fathers miſſion or ſending of him to be the cauſe of being our Mediatour.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This love of the Fathers to him was ſeen <hi>in taking that particular humane nature rather then any other into an hypoſtaticall <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi>; Though Chriſt did not take an individuall humane perſonalized as men are, yet he took a particular nature into a perſonal Union with the God-head, which is the greateſt exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mans nature that can poſſibly be imagined; It's that great myſtery which Angels are continually ſearching into; but if you ask <hi>why the ſecond Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon did take this particular nature rather then another, that the holy Ghoſt might have ſanctified?</hi> here Gods meer love made the difference, for as it was an high act of grace and favour to the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> that ſhe rather then any other woman ſhould be appointed to be the mother of Chriſt, ſo it was much more a great honour and expreſſion of love that this humane nature rather then an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other was aſſumed into perſonal Union, and for this cauſe it is that <hi>Auſtin</hi> did ſo invincibly preſſe the <hi>Pelagians</hi> with this argument from Chriſt as man, for (ſaith he) if Chriſt as man was choſen not for any foreſeen merit or worth which might be in him, but it was ſolely by the love and goodneſſe of God, then much more will it follow that no meer man eſpecially corrupted and defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, can be elected to Eternal Life upon the ſuppoſition or preſcience of any good thing in man, So that Chriſt as man was ſo, meerly from the favour and love of the Father, This is that <hi>gratia ſingularis</hi> to Chriſt as man, <hi>de quâ fas eſt praedicare, ſed nefas adjudicare,</hi> as <hi>Auſtin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The love of the Father to Chriſt in preparing him for Mediatour, is ſeen in the <hi>ſanctifying and endowing of him with all holineſſe,</hi> that ſo he might <hi>be a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Saviour, for ſeeing it behoved us to have ſuch an high-Prieſt as was holy and ſeparate from ſin,</hi> therefore it was that he was made man in ſuch an extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry manner, for he was <hi>conceived by the holy Ghoſt</hi>; The holy Ghoſt ſanctified that corpulent ſubſtance of Chriſts body wherby there was not any form of or inclination to ſin abiding in him, and therefore he is called the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> becauſe he wrs habitually and originally holy; Now this was wholly of the love of God that his humane nature was thus anointed with all holineſſe, and that he received the Spirit of God without meaſure, and therefore the humane nature of Chriſt was infinitely obliged to bleſs and praiſe God who had powred more holineſſe into it then in all Angels and men; Thus the Fathers love was ſeen in preparing him to be Mediatour, and <hi>when he was thus appointed, and in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of his Office; The love of the Father was exceeding great to him</hi>:</p>
            <p>For 1. you have the Father in a <hi>moſt glorious manner from heaven, owning of him,</hi> and giving of that ſolemn approbation, <hi>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed,</hi> what a glorious manifeſtation was here of the Fathers love to him, his love did reſt on him, yet ſo as thereby he makes others beloved Sonnes in
<pb n="671" facs="tcp:65216:355"/>
whom alſo he is well-pleaſed, even thoſe that do believe in him; This glorious Teſtimony then given to Chriſt by the Father is made by ſome Learned men part of that glory which is ſpoken of in <hi>v.</hi> 22.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. The Fathers love is wonderfully diſcovered to him as Mediatour, <hi>in that he was willing to lay down his life for thoſe who were appointed to ſalvation</hi>; Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that although the world thought him forſaken of God, and ſmitten for his own ſins, yea, though Chriſt himſelf in reſpect of his ſence and feeling expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtulated with his Father, why he had forſaken him, yet even then was the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers love moſt of all towards him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.17. <hi>Therefore doth my Father love me, becauſe I lay down my life for my ſheep</hi>; Here you ſee that although there were many other Reaſons of the Fathers love to him, yet he inſtanceth in this where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we would think Gods anger was for the preſent moſt diſplaied; It's true, this is urged by ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>me that therefore Chriſt could not ſuffer the anger of God in his ſoul, neither could the Father afflict him as for our ſins, for how could this be, (ſay they) that at the ſame time the Father ſhould love him and yet be angry w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>th him, as puniſhing the ſins of all the Elect upon him; But as Gods love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Chriſt could conſiſt with that leaving of him to the hands of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, So alſo could the love of the Father towards the perſon of Chriſt well conſiſt with that anger of his towards him as our Surety, and certainly this very particular may much encourage the people of God, for when they are ſollicitous about their acceptance with the Father whether he will receive them into grace or no, what a ready anſwer is this, the Father loveth Chriſt becauſe he would die for us, becauſe he would be crucified for us.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. The Fathers love towards him is eſpecially ſeen <hi>in exalting of him to all that honour and Majeſty the Scripture ſo often mentioneth,</hi> that is, the ſitting at the right hand of God the Father; It is true, as God he had a right to all this glory before, but then there was a manifeſtation of it, and not only ſo, but a reall communication of ſuch glory to his humane nature which it had not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and his perſon was not admitted into a more plenary and conſummate poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of that glory, of which there was but beginnings before; Even as it was with <hi>David,</hi> firſt he had a right given him to the Kingdom, but for the preſent he was in conſtant oppreſſions and miſeries; Thus Chriſt while having a right to all majeſty and divine honour was in a ſtate of humiliation, and he was in a form of a ſervant, even then when he was equal to God, and as <hi>David</hi> when he came to the actuall poſſeſſion of the Kingdom, did come to it by degrees, firſt at <hi>Hebron</hi> in ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>me part, and then afterwards in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> over all <hi>Iſrael</hi>; Thus the Lord Chriſt while on earth had ſeverall diſcoveries of his divine glory and honour, but the full enjoyment of it was upon his aſcenſion, and hence it is that here he ſpeaks he was loved <hi>before the foundation of the world,</hi> becauſe the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had appointed this glory to him from all Eternity; Thus we have handled this love as it relateth to Chriſt, but you muſt know that it doth not concern him only, but it belongs alſo to the whole Church of God, So that herein is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved our greateſt conſolation, for there are theſe particulars contained in it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That Christ and we are comprehended in one act as it were of Gods love and his Election</hi>; So that although we may and muſt conceive a priority and poſterio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity <hi>in ſigno rationis,</hi> as they ſay, yet in <hi>naturâ</hi> they are together, for ſeeing that the Father did predeſtinate him to be head of his Church, and ſo doth love him as head of his Church, it muſt neceſſarily follow, that the Church alſo which are members to Chriſt their head, muſt be included in that Election, for the head and the body cannot be ſevered; Now doth not this wonderfully make for the glory and comfort of Gods people, that at the ſame time Chriſt was appointed to be a Mediatour; They alſo are ordained to be ſaved by him; As ſoon as ever he was made the head, they were made the body; In this reſpect it is that Chriſt and believers are ſaid to make up <hi>one myſticall perſon,</hi> and by this
<pb n="672" facs="tcp:65216:356"/>
means what Chriſt had and did is communicated unto us.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Here followeth the Eternity of Gods love to us,</hi> For ſeeing that Chriſt was lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved before the foundation of the world, So alſo muſt we, for we <hi>are choſen in him,</hi> Eph. 1.4. <hi>from all Eternity</hi>; So that although the effects of Gods love are vouchſafed to us in time, yet the purpoſe to do this was from all Eternity; Oh then the overflowing love of God to a beleever, how ſhould this melt thy heart and be like fire in thy bowels, when thou hadſt no thought of thy ſelf, when no friend could ſpeak a word for thee, yet even then God had thoughts of mercy towards thee.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Here is the perpetuity and immutability of the Fathers love to thee,</hi> for he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not repent in his love as men may, They ſometimes love thoſe who prove other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then they expected, They never thought ſuch would prove ſo forgetfull, and therefore repent of all the kindeneſſe that ever they ſhewed them, but it is not ſo with God, for he foreknew all that ever we would do, he knew our ſins, our unkindneſſes, our rebellions, and yet for all this intended love to us, ſo that God cannot ſay, theſe men are greater ſinners, prove more unkinde to me then ever I thought they would have; No, the only wiſe God cannot be ſubject to ſuch errour, beſides men may love thoſe where they repent afterwards, becauſe they cannot make them good whom they love, the more they love, it may be the perſons loved do become the worſe by it, but it is not ſo with God, whom he loveth he makes holy; This is one great effect of his love, to put his Image into them, to make them walk in fear of him all the day long, Thus God will immutably love becauſe he will alwaies keep up grace in the hearts of thoſe where he hath begun it.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, <hi>This love is perpetuall becauſe in Christ</hi>; We are now joyned to him by an Union that can never be diſſolved; When Chriſt ceaſeth to be an head then we ſhall ceaſe to be his body, So that the perſeverance of the Saints is built on this rock, they <hi>are elected in Chriſt, and are in time united to him,</hi> and therefore ſhall never be caſt off, no more then the Father will ceaſe to love Chriſt as an head, but theſe things were in part ſpoken to before.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe,</hi> Doth the Father thus love Chriſt? Then what ſtrong arguments have we to believe and be confident in all thoſe Petitions which are put up in Chriſts Name; Hath Chriſt praied for thy Sanctification, for thy preſervation, that the evil of the world may not infect thee; Know Chriſt is ſo loved that nothing can be denied him; What if the Father love not thee for thy own ſake, what if he ſee no lovelineſſe in thee, yet in Chriſt he ſeeth enough; Certainly as the Father doth only look upon us in Chriſt, ſo ſhould we alſo look upon our ſelves as in him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. Are the godly alſo comprehended in the ſame love wherein Chriſt is? then what matter of joy have they under all diſcouragements, under all the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred and cruell oppoſitions they meet with in the world? What though the world hate thee, though thou haſt no love from all thy natural friends ever ſince thou began to love God; Oh poſſeſſe thy ſoul with this love of God in Chriſt, for this anſwers all things.</p>

            <p>SOme have thought that our Saviour having finiſhed his prayer for all ſorts of believers, he doth now give thanks to God, that had revealed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to them, and not unto the wicked world, and therefore they compare it with that place of <hi>Luke</hi> 10.21. But the general torrent of Interpreters upon more probable grounds, does conceive this to be a continuation ſtill of the former prayer, for the eternal glory of all believers. Indeed <hi>Piſcator</hi> thinks, that our Saviour doth in this cloſe, return again to the Apoſtles onely, but the Arguments our Saviour uſeth, are general, and do relate to all believers, and therefore we are not to limit this comfortable paſſage to ſome eminent believers onely.</p>
            <p>The Matter (you heard) prayed for all believers, was, <hi>their eternal happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> expreſſed in thoſe words, <hi>to behold the glory, which the Father had given him,</hi> with the reaſon of it, <hi>becauſe the Father had loved him before the foundation of the world.</hi> So that although Chriſt as God had right to glory alwayes, yet being in the fleſh, after an infirm and paſſible manner, the glory thereof was eclipſed, which the Ancients did well expreſs by a <hi>Candle</hi> or <hi>Lamp</hi> in a lantern, that would indeed give great light, but the lantern being compaſſed about with clay, hindred the emiſſion of that light, till it were removed, and thus till all thoſe humane infirmities were taken away, which Chriſt ſubjected himſelf to, while in the fleſh, and he riſen again, thoſe glorious beams of his Divinity, could not ſend forth themſelves. This (I ſay) being the matter of the Petition, our Saviour doth further confirm it, by continuing this prayer with ſeveral ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments more, whereof the firſt is from the <hi>oppoſition</hi> or <hi>antitheſis</hi> that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the wicked damned world, and believers, expreſſed in theſe words, <hi>The world hath not known,</hi> that is their Character.</p>

            <p>OUr Saviour (we heard) is continuing Arguments why he ſhould be heard thus in his Petition for all believers, and that which is firſt ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted in theſe words is the oppoſition and contrariety between the world and them; Though the world be ignorant and obſtinate againſt Chriſt, yet the Diſciples they did readily believe in him: Now this is a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull aggravation of their holineſſe, for <hi>them only</hi> to believe amongſt a world of unbelievers and oppoſers, To ſee amongſt ſo many that are blinde, To be wiſe amongſt ſo many that are mad, yea, to believe in Chriſt, while the world did oppoſe and perſecute them, this did greatly commend their ftith:</p>

            <p>IN theſe words are contained the cauſe and fountain of all that ſaving know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge which beleevers have, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe Chriſt knoweth God: For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the immediate oppoſition ſhould have runne thus, <hi>The world hath not known thee, but theſe have known thee</hi>; This is inſerted, as the cauſe, <hi>I have known thee.</hi> The word is in the Preterperfect tenſe, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> for the Preſent, as <hi>John</hi> 8 55. <hi>I know him, and keep his ſaying.</hi> Now Chriſts knowledge may be conſidered two wayes, either</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Subjectively,</hi> or immanent in him: Or,</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Tranſitively,</hi> or by way of communication unto others; as the fountains fulneſſe may be conſidered either abſolutely in it ſelf, or as originally redun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant and diffuſive to it's ſtreams. Now though the firſt kinde of knowledge be neceſſarily preſuppoſed, yet the latter is chiefly aimed at, as appeareth by thoſe words, <hi>I have declared unto them thy Name, and will declare unto them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In theſe words therefore our Saviour doth manifeſt himſelf to be the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and in a more peculiar manner the Prophet of his Church, whereby he communicates ſaving knowledge unto all beleevers, and that he is the Sunne, which enlightneth every one that cometh into the Church, That as God hath put all material light into the body of the Sunne, and all other things are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned by it: Thus it is with Chriſt the Sun of righteouſneſſe, all ſpiritual know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is given unto him, and that without meaſure, from whom there are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral emanations and irradiations, whereby all that know ſpiritually, are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned by him: Thus he is the truth and the way.</p>
            <p>Obſ.<note place="margin">

               <hi>That Chriſt is the original and fontal cauſe of all the knowledge that belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers have.</hi> There is not the leaſt ray or beam of any ſpiritual illumination, that doth not deſcend from him.</p>
            <p>There are pregnant Texts to confirm this, <hi>John</hi> 1.18. <hi>No man hath ſeen God at any time, the only begotten Son, which is in the boſom of the Father, he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared him</hi>; Where we have an oppoſition of Chriſt to <hi>Moſes,</hi> who yet talked to God, face to face, and to all other Prophets, though they had immediate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirations and revelations, yet none of theſe ſaw God at any time, that is, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly and comprehenſively; They were but ſervants, and had no more mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted to them, then what was convenient; but Chriſt <hi>he is the only begotten Son of God,</hi> and <hi>in the boſom of the Father,</hi> he knoweth the minde, the ſecrets, all the whole counſel and purpoſe of God, and that of himſelf; and this he doth not keep cloſe in himſelf, as <hi>Paul</hi> when caught up into the third heavens, heard things not to be uttered, but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> thoſe things that otherwiſe were hidden and obſcure, he had made clear and known: Thus you ſee, that firſt Chriſt hath a full and perfect knowledge of the minde of God, and that he hath it,
<pb n="682" facs="tcp:65216:361"/>
not in ſuch a manner as the holy Prophets ſometimes received it, but of himſelf, and that this knowledge he doth not keep to himſelf, no more then the Sun doth its light, but he hath it to reveal, and declare it to his people, ſo that we have the minde of God, becauſe Chriſt hath revealed it: Therefore ſome ſay, he is called the word of God, becauſe he doth manifeſt the inward purpoſes of God for our ſalvation, and the means to attain thereunto. This truth alſo is abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly confirmed <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.31.32. where all the Prophets, and <hi>John</hi> himſelf is deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in reſpect of Chriſt, <hi>He that cometh from heaven is above all</hi>; All others come of the earth, but Chriſt, becauſe coming from heaven, the boſom of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, therefore he is above all, but it followeth, <hi>What he hath ſeen and heard he teſtifieth</hi>; ſo that he communicateth this knowledge to the world; Therefore the unbelief of the world is heavily taxed, <hi>No man receiveth his teſtimony.</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Chriſt be to be preferred above all that were ever ſent by God, for they were only infallible directively, and by outward aſſiſtance only, but Chriſt eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially and internally, yet the world doth not receive his teſtimony. If then it be thus, That Chriſt only knoweth God, and from him knowledge is derived to all others; Even the Doctors and Teachers in the Church, do ſtrive by his light, then it's no wonder if God from heaven doth take us of all others, and bid us attend to him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 17.5. <hi>Hear ye him:</hi> So that we are not to regard, what the wiſeſt, the learned, or the moſt ancient ſay, but what Chriſt ſaith.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Propoſitions about the point.</note>To open this truth, Conſider theſe things:</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That Chriſt a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> God hath omniſciency, knowing all things.</hi> 1 Cor. 2.11. What is there attributed to the Spirit of God, is true alſo of the Sonne of God, <hi>The Spirit ſearcheth the deep things of God:</hi> Thus Chriſt as God muſt needs compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend all the things of God, and ſo there is nothing hid from him; And this Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſciency of his, was often manifeſted, eſpecially <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. when it's ſaid, <hi>He knew what was in man, and needed not that any ſhould tell him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The humane Nature of Chriſt, or Chriſt as man knew not all things, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the Divine Nature revealed the hidden things of God, ſo he came to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him.</hi> Therefore the Doctrine of the <hi>Lutherans</hi> ſeem to confound the Natures, when they ſay, <hi>The properties of the Divine Nature are communicated to the humane Nature, Omniſcience and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>biquity,</hi> &amp;c. This cannot be, and yet Chriſt abide a true man. Hence he is ſaid <hi>to grow in knowledge</hi>; yea as Son of man he is ſaid, <hi>Not to know the day of Judgement,</hi> Mat. 24.36. which cannot be explained, as ſome would, he knew it not, <hi>viz.</hi> to reveal it, for in that ſenſe the Father alſo might be ſaid not to know it, yet the humane nature of Chriſt, though it was capable of neſciency, yet not of ignorance, for as he was without all ſin, ſo without all ignorant defects in minde, he wanted no perfection that was due to him, it was an experimental knowledge he grew in.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Even the humane Nature of Chriſt, is now lifted up to know many things without which as the Judge of the world, he could not accompliſh that work.</hi> For ſeeing that Chriſt God-man is appointed to judge the world, it's neceſſary that even as man, there ſhould be revealed unto him, all the thoughts, actions and circumſtances thereof concerning every man in the world, that ſo he might ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill the office of a Judge.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Chriſt, as Mediator, God and man is the author and fountain of all the light, which is communicated to the Church.</hi> Hence it is that one of his Offices is to be the Prophet of the Church: He is called the chief ſhepherd of our ſouls, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5 4. and being our high-Prieſt, he was to offer up himſelf for us, ſo alſo inſtruct and teach us: Therefore you heard the whole world is commanded to hear him, and therefore it is that he cals himſelf, <hi>the truth and the way,</hi> Joh. 14.16. So that in all matters of Religion we are ſtill to enquire what Chriſt hath revealed, and what he hath manifeſted; now he doth not only reveal the truth to be believed, but the duties alſo that are to be performed, and therefore the Apoſtle makes it
<pb n="683" facs="tcp:65216:361"/>
ſo hainous a ſinne to refuſe Chriſt ſpeaking above <hi>Moſes,</hi> Heb. 12.25. Tremble then all ye wicked men, who do conſtantly refuſe Chriſt ſtill ſpeaking from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by his Word and Miniſters to leave your ſins and impieties.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>The Scripture doth often (as in all actions</hi> ad extra) <hi>attribute the ſame work of teaching and enlightning, both to the Father, and to the Son, and to the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi> So that this great work of ſaving knowledge is attributed indifferently to all. Thus the Father <hi>James</hi> 1. is called <hi>the Father of lights from whom cometh every good and perfect gift:</hi> So our Saviour alledgeth that promiſe, <hi>They ſhall be all taught of God,</hi> Joh. 6.45. So the holy Spirit is ſaid <hi>to guide and lead into all truth,</hi> Illumination being frequently aſcribed to the Spirit, and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.10. God is ſaid there <hi>to reveal things unto us by his Spirit.</hi> And laſtly, Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is ſaid to be the great teacher of his people, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.10. <hi>For one is your Maſter, even Chriſt.</hi> Hence the Apoſtle magnifieth the Goſpel, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. that whereas <hi>formerly God had ſpoken by the Prophets, in theſe later dayes he ſpake by his Sonne:</hi> So that the geeat ſinne againſt the Goſpel, and the aggravation of all wickedneſſe is from hence, that <hi>though this light be come into the world, yet men love darkneſſe rather then light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>The Lord Chriſt doth teach ſeveral wayes, either immediately, when he was upon the earth, or mediately by the Apoſtles and the Miniſters that he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in his Church.</hi> Therefore he is ſaid ſtill to ſpeak from heaven, <hi>viz.</hi> by the Word and the Miniſtry: ſo that we are not to conceive, as if we had nothing of Chriſt now, becauſe he is aſcended to heaven, for what the Miniſters, guided by the Word of God, do, that is, as if Chriſt himſelf ſpake it, and you are to receive it with the like faith and obedience. Hence our Saviour ſpeaking to his Apoſtles ſaith, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.16. <hi>He that heareth you, heareth me, and he that deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth you, deſpiſeth me</hi>; he that deſpiſeth an Embaſſadour contemneth him from whom he is ſent: Oh that this truth may be as a two-edged Sword in thy heart! What dareſt thou, who liveſt in thy prophaneneſs, if Chriſt himſelf were here upon the earth, commanding thee to leave thy ſins, yet to perſevere in them, if not, How is it that you refuſe thoſe who come in his name?</p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>Though Chriſt hath appointed a Miniſtry to teach and inſtruct people, yet the whole efficacy and power cometh from Chriſt alone.</hi> It's God and Chriſt by the Word that can only open the underſtanding, and give a ſpiritual knowledge, ſo that converſion is ſo called the teaching of God, <hi>John</hi> 6.45. Therefore a man muſt hear and learn of the Father, before he can come to Chriſt, onely Chriſt there addeth, that this hearing and knowing of the Father comes by him: So <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.26, 27. when <hi>Johns</hi> Diſciples ſaid, <hi>That all men come to Chriſt,</hi> he anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>A man can receive nothing, except it be given him of heaven,</hi> attributing it to the power of God, that any come to Chriſt. Therefore this Sun exceedeth the bodily one, which giveth indeed external light, but cannot give an eye to ſee, the blinde remain blinde for all that.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, <hi>Though Chriſt only do effectually give a knowing heart, ſo that although we had the beſt Miniſtry of men and Angels, yet it would do no good without his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret power and energie, yet we muſt not from thence inferre the uſeleſneſs of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, as ſome fooliſhly have done, oppoſing the principal and ſubordinate.</hi> For in our natural life, although it be not the bread we eat, but the word of bleſſing from Gods mouth, that makes it to nouriſh us, yet none caſts away his food, reſolving to depend on God immediately: Thus though Chriſt alone give the ſeeing eye, and the underſtanding heart, yet it's by and in the uſe of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry; though it was God alone that did give the healing vertue to the pool of <hi>Betheſda,</hi> yet the Angel muſt move it, and every lame man muſt come into it, elſe he could not be healed. Hence although <hi>Jeremy</hi> propheſie of ſuch abundance of knowledge, that they <hi>ſhall not teach one another, but be all taught of God,</hi> which may ſeem and is brought by ſome to overthrow the Miniſtry, yet the ſame Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<pb n="684" facs="tcp:65216:362"/>
               <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.15. declareth it as a ſpecial bleſſing, that he would give them <hi>Paſtors according to his own heart, which would feed them with knowledge and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:</hi> So that Gods teaching, and the Paſtors teaching do not oppoſe one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. It's ſaid alſo of <hi>Lydia, that God opened her heart,</hi> Act. 16.14. but to what end? To attend to the words of <hi>Paul:</hi> So that you muſt never oppoſe Gods work, and the Miniſtry together.</p>
            <p>In the next place, <hi>Let us conſider the Properties of Chriſts knowledge, whereby he makes us alſo to know.</hi> As</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The Authoritative and poteſtative Nature of it, he taught as one having au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, not as the Scribes and Phariſees,</hi> Mat. 7.29. Hence <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. when he had related the corrupt opinions of their Doctors in the Interpretation of the Law, he addeth, <hi>But I ſay unto you,</hi> oppoſing his Authority to them all. It's true, he ſaith, he ſpeaks not of himſelf, but referreth his Doctrine wholly to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but withall ſaith, <hi>He and his Father are one</hi>; he doth not ſpeak of recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his Doctrine in the ſame manner, as <hi>Paul,</hi> and other Apoſtles did of him by revelation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>There is the freeneſs of this, he teacheth whom he pleaſeth.</hi> There are none ſo froward, and ſo contumacious, but he can open their hearts, and others that are of high and eminent underſtandings for want of him do remain blind owls, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.26, 27. where our Saviour giving God thanks for manifeſting the things of the Goſpel to ſome, and not to others, reſolving all into Gods good pleaſure, <hi>Even ſo (Father) for ſo it pleaſeth thee,</hi> he addeth, <hi>No man knoweth the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but the Sonne, and he to whomſoever the Son will reveal him:</hi> So that where the Son will reveal it, there is knowledge, and where he will not, there remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth blindneſs.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>There is the effectual and powerfull way of this revealing,</hi> ſuch ſhall know, ſuch will come to God, ſuch ſhall have the vail-taken off their eyes, and the ſtone out of their hearts.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>There is the continual and daily efficacy of this, I have manifeſted it to them, and will do it.</hi> Though they were Apoſtles, yet they need the daily guidance and illumination of Chriſts Spirit, we cannot either begin, or proceed without him.</p>

               <hi>theſe</hi> who are ſaid thus to know, though ſome limit it to the Apoſtles only, yet becauſe the world is made the immediate oppoſite to it, we are to extend it to all believers; I have handled this deſcription of believers Faith abſolutely already, both as it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led knowledge, and as it is terminated upon Chriſt as ſent by the Father, and hereby diſtinguiſhed from the abſolute knowledge which men may have of God without Chriſt: I ſhall therefore only take notice of it relatively, as it ſtands by way of argument in this Petition, for therefore doth Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend them as the fit objects of glory, becauſe they do believe, though the world be wicked and mad oppoſers of the knowledge of God.</p>
            <p>Obſ. <hi>That it's an endearing reſpect of believers to God that they do own him,</hi>

               <hi>and cleave to him, when the whole world goeth the contrary way</hi>; If the whole world did lie in godlineſſe, as it's ſaid to be in wickedneſſe; If every one did believe in God, then the excellency of ſuch who do believe would not be ſo great: If all the ſtones of the earth were jewels, then theſe would not be ſo much ſet by, and if all the weeds of the field were choice flowers, then flowers would not be ſo much regarded, ſo that the wickedneſs of the world is an excellent foil to the godlineſs of believers; The darker the night is, the light of the ſtars is thereby the brighter, and this the Apoſtle alludeth unto in that glorious commendation given to the Saints at <hi>Philippi,</hi> Phi. 2.15. where praying that they might be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out rebuke in the midſt of a crooked and perverſe generation, he tels them, <hi>they did ſhine as lights in the world,</hi> So that as the darker the night is, the more glory is in the ſtar when it ſhineth, ſo the more perverſe and wicked the world is, the more amiable and lovely is the faith of ſuch who believe in Chriſt; Hence

it is that ſuch an encouraging promiſe is made to ſuch who confeſs Chriſt before men, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. that is an adulterous and wicked generation, as <hi>Mar.</hi> 8, 38. The acknowledging of God amongſt ſo many vile oppoſers and wicked perſecutors is eſpecially taken notice of by God; Thus when the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>Lot,</hi> how merciful God was in protecting and delivering him from the impen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent judgements he giveth him this character, <hi>that he was a juſt and righteous man,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.7. which was abundantly diſcovered in this, <hi>that he was vexed</hi> (tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented as if he had been put upon the rack the word is applied to the very tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of hell) <hi>with the converſation of the wicked,</hi> his eye and ears, yea the whole ſoul it ſelf was vexed with their unlawful deeds, for <hi>Lot</hi> to walk righteouſly and holily in the midſt of ſuch miſcreants and incarnate devils as they were, this moved God to have a more ſpecial care over him.</p>

To be godly in a wicked and crooked generation doth indear to God <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thereby is manifeſted our ſincerity and uprightneſſe of heart</hi>; That there are no carnal and earthly advantages we look after, for if there were our earthly policy would ſuggeſt us to take ſome other way, and for this reaſon it may be thought our Saviour did upon all occaſion to ſuch who proffered to be his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, ſtill inform them of the hardſhip, of the troubles and miſeries they muſt meet with, That ſo they might not apoſtatize afterwards, that they might not ſay, this is more then ever was told us, we would never have taken up the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Chriſt upon ſuch terms; And certainly this is a rock many have ſplit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at, they begin to be diſciples of Chriſt before they throughly conſider how much it will coſt them to be ſo indeed, they do not take our Saviours advice, <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.31. <hi>to ſit down</hi> and conſider whether being now to go to war with ſuch luſts and ſins as formerly have been ſweet to them, they can endure or no, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their luſts will not prove too ſtrong for them, and ſo they compound at laſt to be their ſervants again, they conſider not whether being now to rear up a ſtrong and enduring building they can be at ſo much coſt or no, whether they can extend ſo much from their former time, and cares and worldly thoughts and buſineſſes, ſo as to make this building their great work for want of theſe conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations aforehand, it is that ſo many have dealt fooliſhly in the way of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, They began but could not make an end; Oh but now when the heart is
<pb n="687" facs="tcp:65216:363"/>
ſincere and upright, there it accounts no fiery triall ſtrange, whatſoever diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty and trouble it meeteth with; It ſaith, this I looked for, this I expected, this I muſt undergo, and by this we diſcover our uprightneſs to God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we are more indeared to God, that it is not any outward thing but himſelf only that makes us profeſs our obedience to him, and this indeareth us to God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thoſe that believe in Chriſt in the midſt of a wicked and ungodly world are eſteemed of by God, <hi>becauſe ſuch have the image of God reſtored in them,</hi> and ſo become like him, now then where God ſeeth his own likeneſſe, there he will tenderly reſpect and protect; He that hath put ſuch bowels into a Father, that he will lay up for his children, and take more care of them then all other chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in the world, muſt much more have ſuch bowels in himſelf towards thoſe that are his; Hence it is that we are ſo often exhorted to meditate on that rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Father which he hath ſo graciouſly aſſumed to himſelf, for what Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there that ſeeth his good and obedient childe maintaing his credit, ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving for his honour againſt all thoſe that ſhall oppoſe him, will not inwardly be moved to take part with his childe, and defend him all he can, and ſhall not our heavenly Father much more ſhew his love herein to us? our Saviour would convince believers, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.8. not to be troubled under any exerciſes from the tranſcendent affection that is in him as an heavenly Father to all earthly parents; Seeing therefore believers do reſemble God, and he ſeeth his own likeneſs upon them, Inſomuch that God ſaith, it's not ſo much for their ſakes as my ſake, that they are thus maligned, how can it be but that God will take care of them?</p>
            <p n="4">4 <hi>Such as believe in Chriſt they are become the Lords in a more peculiar propriety</hi>; They are his people, they are his <hi>jewels,</hi> they are <hi>the apple of his eye,</hi> and this <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety</hi> is that which prevaileth with God to keep them, though all the world be deſtroied, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4. all wicked oppoſers of the godly are exhorted to know this that God hath ſet apart the godly man for himſelf; That as the godly man ſets God apart for himſelf, leaveth all the world to take him for his portion, So on the other ſide God paſſeth by wicked men, they are not in his favour or ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial protection but the godly are, They are his, and therefore he will love them as his, and delight in them as his; In <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.34. we have a glorious promiſe, <hi>Since thou waſt precious in my ſight, I will give men for thee, and people for thy life,</hi> that is, God will give up many to deſtruction to ſave his children; As they ſaid to <hi>David,</hi> Thou art worth ten thouſand of us, Thus God ſpeaketh concerning his choice ones, they are worth more then many thouſands of wicked men, and it's better thouſands of them periſh then few of the godly, So that this proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Gods children have in God, is that which will be a ſure protection for them to paſſe ſafe through all calamities.</p>
            <p n="5">5. To be faithful to God amongſt wicked men indeareth God to them, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this demonſtrateth many excellent and choice properties in the godly, which make them lovely and precious in his ſight</hi>; As firſt here is demonſtrated <hi>Gods grace already begun in them,</hi> and therefore where God hath begun there will he alſo preſerve to the latter end, for when our Saviour here ſaith, <hi>the world hath not known thee,</hi> but theſe have known thee, he doth not commend them for their own ſtrength and abilities, as if they had differenced themſelves from others, but he diſcovers how much God had loved them hitherto, he choſe us, and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved us firſt, and therefore we chooſe and love him again, So that when believers accept of Chriſt they do not herein diſcover any worth in themſelves, but the infinite grace of God to them that made them to be diſcriminated from others. Now then where Chriſt hath begun to love, there will he conſummate and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh, one degree of Gods love cals for another, and he hath ſo chained his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces together that the link ſhall not be broken, if then you ſee the godly labor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and working after God when all the world is contrary; Do not ſo much admire them as the grace of God given to them; Even as the people did when
<pb n="688" facs="tcp:65216:364"/>
they ſaw the Apoſtles work ſuch wonderfull miracles.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Here is manifeſted their magnanimity and <hi>courage for God,</hi> that they dare confeſſe his Name, and promote his kingdom to ſuch exceeding hazard of all they have; Will not this alſo make God have a ſpecial regard to them? It's moſt acceptable to God to be good in evil times, and amongſt evil men, as <hi>Obedme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lech</hi> in <hi>Ahabs</hi> Courts, and ſome of <hi>Caeſars</hi> houſhold; This magnanimity was admirable in the Confeſſors and Martyrs of old, who deſpiſed death, yea, tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphed over it, inſomuch that though the Heathens ſpeak of a vertue called <hi>fortitude,</hi> and another named <hi>magnanimity,</hi> yet they are never able to ſhew the hundredth or thouſandth part of any heathens ſuffering for their ſect, as we can do millions of Chriſtians for the Chriſtian Faith; If then <hi>David</hi> did ſo much prize his Worthies, and thoſe who were valiant men, venturing their lives for him, were ſo indeared, how much more will God highly eſteem ſuch as are cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious and venturous for him, Therefore there is ſuch encouraging promiſes made to ſuch as <hi>are willing to loſe for him,</hi> Mat. 19.29. <hi>he ſhall receive an hundred fold, and ſhall inherit eternal life</hi>; Is not this plain that God is very tender of and remunerative of ſuch who are couragious and ready to loſe any thing for his ſake.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Herein the godly manifeſt <hi>their love to God</hi>; In this time of adverſity they diſcover their kinde affections towards God; Now love of God is abundantly rewarded with love from God, What a happy exchange is this for thy poor fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite creatures love, which is not able to make God more bleſſed and happy, to have the infinite, effectual, and unſpeakable love of God towards thee; If we love the inanimate creatures they do not love us again; Thou loveſt riches, rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es do not love thee again; Thou loveſt honours, but honours cannot love thee again, but if we place our love upon God, then God will powr out his love a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly upon us again, love obtains love, and where God loveth his love is infinite like himſelf, and withall it's efficacious, his love while we are ſinners made him ſend his Son to die for us; much more will his love be operative ſince reconciled with us.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, All ſuch true believers who acknowledge Chriſt in the midſt of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly world, <hi>they do betake themſelves to Gods faithfulneſs, and reſt only upon that</hi>; They take up this reſolution, all the world will prove malicious and ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, they cannot expect better meaſure then what Chriſt himſelf had, who yet did ſo much good where he came; Now having theſe expectations they fortifie themſelves with Gods promiſe and fidelity, <hi>he will not leave them nor forſake them</hi>; You ſee how often <hi>David</hi> profeſſeth his truſt in God, making him his fortreſſe and ſtrong tower; We ſee among men if any one betake himſelf to another mans fidelity, and ſay, <hi>he will truſt on him,</hi> he will depend upon him, if ſuch an one have any ingenuity or ſpark of goodneſs in him, to be ſure he will not fail ſuch, he will not deceive, how much rather then will God abide ſure and faithful to all thoſe that depend on him.</p>

In this place it's attributed to Chriſt, as the efficient cauſe, <hi>I have declared.</hi> In the next place, there is the diverſity of time, <hi>I have, and will declare it. Auſtin</hi> referreth this to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent life, and the life to come, but it rather denoteth the conſtant and daily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation or manifeſtation of Chriſt himſelf, and his truth to belevers. 3. There
<pb n="690" facs="tcp:65216:365"/>
is the Object declared, <hi>thy Name,</hi> that is God himſelf. 4. The Subject to whom, that is, not the Apoſtles, but to all believers.</p>
            <p>Now I have already handled the benefit mentioned, Chriſts declaring the Name of God to believers: I ſhall onely take notice of the <hi>Neceſſity of continuing this Benefit even to Believers,</hi> though Apoſtles, though never ſo eminent in gifts and graces, yet Chriſt doth ſtill keep up and encreaſe their ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving knowledge.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Doct.</hi> That Believers do not only at their firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, but in the whole pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of their life, need con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from God.</note>Obſerv. <hi>That believers do not only at their firſt converſion, but in the whole progreſs of their life, need conſtant illumination and teaching from God.</hi> There is none can learn ſo much in Gods School, that God himſelf can teach him no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. This truth will be of great uſe to keep the moſt knowing Chriſtians very humble and low in their own eies, as alſo to make them continually depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Chriſt in the Word and Miniſtry, that they may grow in knowledge. This truth is abundantly confirmed by that notable prayer of the Apoſtle for the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſians,</hi> who though they were made light in the Lord, and had the myſtery of Gods will ſo much made known unto them, that he did not ceaſe to give thanks for them daily in that behalf, yet ſtill he prayeth, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.17, 18. <hi>That God would give them the ſpirit of wiſdom and revelation in the knowledge of him, that the eyes of their underſtanding may be inlightned</hi> &amp;c. Here it's plain, That though theſe had knowledge, yet they might ſtill encreaſe in it. Hence the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.19. doth encourage beleevers for their diligent at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending unto the Scripture, <hi>untill the day dawn, and the day-ſtarre ariſe in their hearts,</hi> that is, till they obtain more firm and evident knowledge of the things of God. In the Old Teſtament we have <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 119. though profeſſing he had more knowledge then his teachers, and the Word was continually his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellour, yet prayeth he, That God would <hi>open his eyes, that he may underſtand the wonderfull things of Gods Law. Davids</hi> eyes are not opened clear enough, the word implieth, there are ſome ſcales and film upon his eyes, that muſt be rolled away, and that there are excellent precious things in Gods word, that he doth not yet underſtand.</p>
            <p>For the improving of this truth, Let us conſider in how many particulars a further conſtant teaching by Chriſt is requiſite to the moſt able belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. And</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">I. In reſpect of the object.</note>Firſt, <hi>They need further revelation in reſpect of the objects of their knowledge, to know more then they do know.</hi> So imperfect is every godly mans knowledge, that it may be called ignorance rather then knowledge; We are ignorant of farre more excellent truths in Religion then we do know; If the Heathen could ſay, <hi>Our eyes were in reſpect of natural truth, but like thoſe of the Owl to the Sun</hi>; How much more is this true about ſpiritual objects? You ſee how the Apoſtles knowledge was ſucceſſive, they come to know one thing after another, as Chriſt revealed it, till they had that plentifull effuſion of the holy Ghoſt upon them; And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> who was taught, not of men, but of Chriſt himſelf, yea he was caught up into the third heaven, yet for all that he puts himſelf in the number of thoſe who know but in part, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. So that this is true not only of believers, but of the eminent Doctors and Teachers in the Church, <hi>they know but in part</hi>; yea and that will be true of them, even at their laſt hour though their whole life hath been to obtain knowledge of God. Therefore this ſhould quicken all up to diligent uſe of the means, for who can ſit down and ſay, He knoweth enough, or he knoweth all things? Indeed there have been thoſe that were called <hi>Guoſtiques,</hi> becauſe of the great knowledge they boaſted of, but yet they made themſelves even like bruit beaſts: O then confeſs that the waters of divine truth are ſo deep, that though thou wert an Elephant, yet thou mighteſt ſwim in it, we are as the Ancients ſaid.</p>

we need much aſſiſtance and direction from Chriſt in reſpect of the adjuncts of it.</hi> For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Though we do know the objects, yet we may every day know them more evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, more diſtinctly, more clearly.</hi> Alas our knowledg about God and Chriſt is very confuſed, and therefore <hi>Paul</hi> is every day deſirous to know Chriſt better then he did: As it is with digging in a Mine of Gold, every daies labour brings richer and fuller ſupplies; or as the draining from a Spring, doth not exhauſt, but makes it more plentifull: Thus it is with the heart of a man when ſet to know God or Chriſt: There are new conſiderations, new reſpects, and new argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ariſing alwayes from them; Inſomuch that God and Chriſt may ſeem new to the ſoul every day; we begin to nauſeate, and grow weary, when the ſame things we know, are alwayes ſuggeſted unto us, but the ſoul of a man can never he weary of the knowledge of Chriſt, <hi>For in him are hidden all trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of wiſdom and grace</hi>: And therefore even thoſe principalities and powers in heavenly places, that are ſo vaſt and comprehenſive in knowledge, yet <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.10. The Lord Chriſt is in the Miniſtry of the Church made more known to them continually; So that if Angels do learn in Chriſts School, and obtain more knowledge of him, and do with great delight ſearch into theſe things; no wonder then, if the moſt enlightned men may yet ſearch deeper and deeper into the Lord Jeſus Chriſt: <hi>Paul</hi> though one of the higheſt Scholars in Chriſts School, yet deſired to know nothing but Chriſt crucified, for if in heaven the knowledge of God, when yet it is intuitive and tranſcendent to this, we have will not weary us, but daily provoke the ſoul to know God more, no wonder then if in this life our knowldge be not ſatisfied, when it is but in part.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>As we need Chriſts daily manifeſtation in reſpect of the evidence of them, ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in reſpect of the firmnes and immoveableneſs of our knowledge.</hi> Faith, you heard, is knowledge, and that doth neceſſarily imply aſſent: Now if our aſſent be not firm and ſetled, <hi>We are like children toſſed up and down with every winde of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine:</hi> Inſtability and inconſtancy is much condemned in Scripture; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it doth directly oppoſe faith, which makes the ſoul confidently and firmly-adhere to the truths of Chriſt, as divine, as thoſe which cannot be diſpenſed with, or ever prove falſe; for if <hi>Paul</hi> thought it ſo great a diſparagement, that with him ſhould be yea and nay in his words, much more would this be reproch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to Chriſt himſelf, who ſaith, <hi>He is the truth it ſelf,</hi> Joh. 14. So that as truth cannot be a lie, ſo neither can the Doctrine of Chriſt be falſe: Now the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine being in it ſelf thus true, the power of Chriſt is ſeen in making a gracious heart thus ſtrongly to adhere upon divine motives to it, as that which wil abide, though heaven and earth ſhall paſs away; Scepticiſm and faith are directly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite; when we are inabled to believe, we receive it as the truth of God, and not as the truth of man: So although while this gift of faith was not beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon us, we debated truths of Religion, like thoſe in Philoſophy, and were prone to have, as <hi>Hilary</hi> ſaid of old, <hi>Menſtruam &amp; annuam fidem,</hi> a monethly or yearly faith, yet when God ſhall once ſtrengthen us to believe then we are no longer reeds ſhaken with wind, but as <hi>Origen</hi> of old alluded, <hi>When many things are removed from us, then this</hi> Arundo <hi>(for of that they made pens formerly) is made the</hi> Calamus <hi>the pen of a ready writer:</hi> Where God ſtrengthens us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, there that turning this way and that way, that mutability is removed, and our hearts are fixed, ſo as to be able to dig for that we ſo firmly adhere unto. Thus the Martyrs they were confirmed by God exceedingly, in reſpect of the ſtability of their aſſent to divine truths, when yet they had great temptations to aſſault them; and we read ſometimes of the Diſciples, that upon the working of ſome great miracles by our Saviour, they are ſaid then to believe, not but that they beleived before, only they did grow and encreaſe in this more: Oh then in times of great diſputes, when learned and godly men differ in many
<pb n="692" facs="tcp:65216:366"/>
things, it behoveth the godly Chriſtian to fly to this manifeſtation of Chriſt! Oh ſay, declare it Lord, and ſtill declare it to me more and more! And certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it appeareth by <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. That thoſe who are falſe Prophets, have ſo many fair pretences and deceivable wayes, that if it were poſſible, they would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the very elect; ſo that it's a very great mercy to be of a ſound mind, and eſtabliſhed in the truth; That as <hi>Jeſus Chriſt is the ſame yeſterday, and to day, and for ever,</hi> ſo alſo believers are to be.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>We need Chriſts daily declaration in reſpect of the efficacy and practical ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of our knowledge.</hi> So that although we know all myſteries, yet if the power of Chriſt doth not make us to acknowledge theſe things in a godly manner, <hi>We are but as tinkling cymbals</hi>; you ſee <hi>Paul</hi> made <hi>knowledge</hi> a meer puff, a nothing without <hi>charity,</hi> 1 Cor. 13. and our Saviour puts happineſs upon the <hi>doing,</hi> not <hi>knowing</hi> of theſe things, <hi>John</hi> 14.17. A Chriſtian may grow two wayes in the extenſion of knowledge, or in the efficacy of knowledge, and this is greatly to be lamented; many deſire to know more opinions, and more notions; many are ſtill propounding more queſtions after queſtions, but the Apoſtle <hi>Epheſ</hi> 4. tels us of the <hi>knowing of the truth as it is in Jeſus,</hi> which makes a Chriſtian <hi>put off the oldman, and put on the new,</hi> as alſo an <hi>acknowledgment of the truth after godlineſs,</hi> Tit. 1. Oh therefore pray, that Chriſt would declare his truths to thee, ſo as they may not only be in thy head, but ſink down into thy heart, and be there like fire inflaming thy bowels! It's not growing in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, at it is knowledge, but growing in it, as it is ſaving and operative, which makes a man fitted for everlaſting glory. As it is not the knowing of what is excellent food, that doth nouriſh a man, but the eating of it, and this only doth the Scripture vouchſafe to call knowledge indeed: Oh then examine thy ſelf! Doſt thou ſo know God, as to live on him by faith, to love and fear him? Doſt thou ſo know Chriſt, as to make him a Mediatour to thee in an appropriated manner? Doeſt thou ſo know the promiſes, as to relie on them, and to make them thy cordial in all temptations? This is to know, in the Scripture language: So that the Chriſtians knowledge is wholly in tendency to operation, as all mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is for reſt, if it be barren it increaſeth our condemnation, and not further our conſolation.</p>
            <p>In the next place, <hi>Let us conſider what are the reaſons, why Chriſt muſt conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually teach his people,</hi> And</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>It is becauſe all heavenly things are revealed from God only.</hi> Even as it is ſaid of the Creation, <hi>John</hi> 1. <hi>All things were made by him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and without him was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing made that was made</hi>: Thus all knowledge in a ſupernatural manner comes from him, and without him we know nothing. Now all thoſe things which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a ſupernatural power for to give the firſt exiſtence to them, require ſuch a power to continue them therein. Hence as Chriſt made all things, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. he is ſtill ſaid <hi>to bear up all things by his power</hi>; and thus likewiſe it is in regard of all ſaving knowledge, that ſame Spirit of Chriſt which did at firſt teach us, muſt in the whole progreſs of our lives teach us; As a man cannot beleive of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſo neither increaſe in faith, or know more firmly and evidently of himſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>All ſaving knowledge is part of that work of grace, which God is the author of in the ſoul.</hi> Now in all the courſe of grace and progreſs therein, it's plain we need the auxiliary power of God continually. Thus the Apoſtle ſpeaking even to thoſe that did believe already, yet he ſaith, <hi>It's God that worketh in us, to will and do</hi>; and as it's God that beginneth, ſo it is he that finiſheth every good work: Hence Chriſt is ſaid <hi>to be the author and finiſher of our Faith,</hi> Heb. 12.2. As it is thus in grace, if God did not keep every godly man, he would fall into the dirt, and all noiſome luſts from which he was once converted: So if God did not keep us firmly and conſtantly in his truth, there is no damnable hereſie, or blaſphemy that is fetched out of hel it ſelf, which a godly man would not fal
<pb n="693" facs="tcp:65216:366"/>
into: So that it's the Covenant and promiſe of God, which keepeth a man equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from erroneous opinions and ſinfull practices.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>There is a neceſſity of Chriſts conſtant teaching his people, becauſe of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection and weakneſs, which is in their beſt knowledge.</hi> That as he pray'd about his faith, <hi>I believe, help my unbelief</hi>; ſo I know Lord, help my ignorance; and therefore it is, that he will have a Miniſtry alwayes in the Church, which as that is to grow conſtantly in knowledge, ſo ought the people much more: Oh then be affected with the true and right apprehenſions of the ſins of thy minde, and thou wilt quickly ſee, that unleſs Chriſt be thy teacher, thou ſhalt die in thy igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>There is a neceſſity of Chriſts further teaching, becauſe of the great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage in a grown knowledge.</hi> As</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>A man is thereby more able to diſcern between things that differ,</hi> he can ſeparate the droſs from the gold.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>He will be more evangelical in the frame of his Spirit,</hi> Heb. 6. The babe is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilfull in the word of righteouſneſs; Ignorance cauſeth many ſcruples and fears, which do hinder thoſe ſpiritual conſolations that ſhould abound in the heart of the godly.</p>
            <p n="3">3 <hi>Hereby they may be guides to others.</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>Rom</hi> 14. ſheweth the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny duties of a ſtrong Chriſtian in reſpect of a weak. It's a bleſſed thing to be a means of edification of others, or the reducing of ſuch as have gone aſtray for want of this growth, many parents, many husbands, though godly for the main, cannot do their duties.</p>

Of humiliation to the beſt perſons, and the beſt Churches, they ſtill need more light; It's not enough Chriſt hath declared to them, but he muſt ſtill declare, not indeed new ſubſtantials and eſſentials to ſalvation, but in regard of the ſuperſtructures of holineſs and truth: That Doctrine in Popery, The Church cannot erre, makes her incurable, and is alſo groſly arrogant. In par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſons, this would alſo breed ſelf-emptineſs, an high eſteem of the Ordinances, it would prevent hereſies and errours, men being commonly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident of themſelves therein, as alſo any ſevere and uncharitable cenſuring of others, knowing, as it is ſaid, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.15.

            <p n="2">2. You have the <hi>ſubject</hi> of this love with the manner of participation of it, <hi>That this love may be in them,</hi> that is, in true believers, and in them only; Some by <hi>love</hi> underſtand the holy Ghoſt, but we may take it for the gracious favour of God, and as <hi>Zanchy</hi> well obſerveth he doth not ſay that this love may be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them (though that alſo be true) but in them; Gods love was to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by way of purpoſe and decree from all Eternity, but it was not in them: Now when Gods love is ſaid to be in them, that is to be underſtood of the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of his love, and more eſpecially of the ſence and aſſurance of his love.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, There is the cauſe of all this expreſſed in theſe words, <hi>And I in them,</hi> where Chriſts myſtical Union with and indwelling in us is made the cauſe of all the love of God to believers, but of this alſo we have already treated, So that there remaineth no new thing but the manner of participation of this love of God to them,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Obſerv.</hi> That it is not enough for the people of God to be loved by him, but they are to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour after the ſence and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of this in their own hearts.</note> and that is ſaid to be in them, which although (as was ſaid) may be true of the ſeveral gracious effects of Gods love, yet I ſhall pitch on that which is the moſt obvious, <hi>viz.</hi> Gods love in a beleever by way of ſence and aſſurance, for God not only loveth them but they may feel this and be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded thereof.</p>
            <p>Obſ. <hi>That it is not enough for the people of God to be loved by him, but they are to endeavovr after the ſence and apprehenſion of this in their own hearts</hi>; This is the Emphaſis, the <hi>Selah</hi> (as it were) in this expreſſion, that Gods love may be in them, our Faith in Chriſt is not only to produce thoſe direct acts, whereby we are perſwaded of Gods love in the generall, but alſo thoſe reflex acts whereby we know and feel that his love is in us; As a man under the Sun-beams feeleth
<pb n="685" facs="tcp:65216:367"/>
and enjoyeth the comfortable influence thereof. So that herein lieth the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat happineſſe of a Chriſtian, to be loved of God, and to perceive and feel this.</p>
            <p>To open this you muſt Conſider,<note place="margin">Conſide,</note>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That the love of God is taken in Scripture</hi> two waies,<note place="margin">I. The love of God is taken two waies in Scripture.</note> either actively for that whereby we love him, or paſſively for that whereby we are loved of him, and ſo ſome Texts do receive different Interpretations becauſe of the different application of that love of God; Now it's true, our love to God is inherent in us, and we may perceive and feel it, as fire ſometime working in us for his glory and honour, but the love of God whereby he loveth us we cannot feel in us, but by the Spirit of God manifeſting and evidencing this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our ſouls: We have a notable Text, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.5. where the <hi>love of God is ſaid to be ſhed abroad in our hearts by the holy Ghoſt which is given us,</hi> which although ſome expound of that love inherent in us, whereby we love God, yet it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth more conſonant to the words preceding, that it is to be underſtood of that love of God whereby he loveth us, for this being diffuſed in our hearts, and we thereby affected with it do rejoyce in tribulations, and have ſuch hope that will never make aſhamed; This then is ſaid to be a ſpecial mercy vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed to Gods Children, that his love is plentifully powred upon them, as <hi>Aarons</hi> Oyle upon his head, and ſo deſcending to other parts, So that by this Love of God they can triumph and be confident in all tribulations and exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes whatſoever; This is an heaven upon the Earth to live in ſuch diſcoveries and evidences of Gods love.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Gods love may be greatly towards us, yea, and the effects of it in us,<note place="margin">II. God may love a man and he know it not.</note> yet for all this we diſcern and feel them not; As it was with the Lord Chriſt our Head, though dearly beloved of his Father, yet in reſpect of any ſenſe and perceivance of Gods love at that time, he was deſtitute of it; <hi>David</hi> doth of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten bewail his condition in reſpect of this ſpirituall deſertion, and indeed there cannot be an heavier temptation upon the godly heart then the clean contrary in the Text; That the wrath and anger of God whereby he is drawn out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the wicked, they ſhould apprehend to be upon them; They who e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem the light of his countenance above all things to finde the frowns and wrath of God, to apprehend his diſpleaſure towards them, this is a burthen greater then they can bear, So that although this be made the connex to their believing in Chriſt, yet it is a ſeparable Conſequent, it is that which may be divided from it ſometimes; At that very time when the godly do believe on Chriſt in a dependent way, they may walk in ſad apprehenſions, knowing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the love of God towards them, yea, in a very dreadful manner queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning of it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Although the love of God towards believers may not be perceived by them, yet they are to preſs forward, they are to pray and wreſtle with God,<note place="margin">III. The ſence of Gods love to be laboured for</note> that they may not continue in darkneſſe but be brought to this comfortable light; The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> preſſeth it as a neceſſary duty, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10. <hi>Give all diligence to make your Calling and Election ſure,</hi> and the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> 2 Cor. 13.5. <hi>Examine your ſelves whether ye be in the Faith, or no</hi>; So that this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py priviledge is poſſible, and many of the people of God without any immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate revelation have attained unto it; Inſomuch that it is for the moſt part our ſin that we walk not in the ſence of it: It is true indeed God ſometimes out of his Soveraignty, and for wiſe ends of his own, doth withdraw this ſenſe and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of his favour, but for the moſt part it is from our ſelves that ſuch black clouds ariſe, which keep the light of the Sun from us.<note place="margin">IV. The ſence of Gods love may be immediate or mediate.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. The ſence and perceiving of Gods love may be either in an immediate manner or mediate; Immediately, and thus Chriſt diſcovered his love to ſome while he was here on earth, or mediately, and that is by the diſcovering of the
<pb n="696" facs="tcp:65216:368"/>
work of grace upon our ſouls, whereby we gather Gods love toward us, and this is the ordinary ſafe way that we are to take, otherwiſe under the pretence of immediate revelations we may fall into ſad deluſions, and this way the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture ſuggeſts, <hi>viz.</hi> that by our love to the brethren, by keeping his Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements we may gather, that we are loved of God; Do not then expect, as if thou ſhouldſt hear a voice from heaven in a glorious manner as Chriſt did, <hi>Thou art my beloved Sonne, in whom I am well pleaſed,</hi> but begin at the work of grace and Sanctification in thy heart, by which thou maiſt certainly conclude of Gods love, as by the Sun-beams we may conclude the Sun riſen, yet this muſt be neceſſarily added, that we can neither diſcern of the work of grace in us, or have ſuch full perſwaſions of Gods love thereby, but by the ſpirit of God, as in <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.5. we of our ſelves through the ſight of the imperfections of our graces, would run from the preſence of God, only it's the ſpirit of adoption gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto us, which makes us have an Evangelical boldneſs before him.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">V. The love of God to his is incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.</note>Laſtly, This love of God perceived and felt by the godly is of a tranſcendent and incomprehenſible nature, So that if we ſhould ſpend our whole life in the meditating of it, yet we are never able to go to the bottom of it; This is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably expreſſed, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3 19. <hi>that ye may know the love of Chriſt which paſſeth all knowledge,</hi> from whence followeth that we are filled with the fulneſs of God, for this love to us is the ſame in kinde though not in degree with that whereby he loveth Chriſt himſelf, Chriſt and his members are comprehended in the ſame act of love, what an unſpeakable conſideration is this to a poor believer; A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain the love of God is ſuch that he gave his only begotten Son to the vileſt and moſt ignominious death for them, which the Apoſtle puts alſo upon it; <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. <hi>God ſo loved the world,</hi> and this love was to us while enemies, while adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, and it's not to bring about a temporall mercy for us, but eternal even e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting glory, and laſtly, this love is immutable and unchangeable, God will never alter his love, or ceaſe to love ſuch, Certainly ſuch a love is that which the heart of a man can never ſufficiently comprehend, muſt needs infl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <note place="margin">The advantage a believer hath by having the powerful feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Gods love.</note>Therefore in the next place let us conſider the great advantages that a believer hath, which hath this powerful ſence and feeling of Gods love within his heart;</p>
            <p>And 1. It doth in a wonderful manner encourage and embolden the ſoul, and that under the thoughts of death and the day of Judgement; If ſo be this were to be the next moment, if this voice were heard, <hi>Ariſe, and come to judgement,</hi> yet the experimental feeling of Gods love would keep the heart ſo far from being dejected and perplexed, that it would rather rejoyce a man, and make him lift up his head, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.17. <hi>Herein is love made perfect</hi> (that is, not our love but Gods love to us, as the Greek intimateth) <hi>that we may have boldneſſe in the day of judgement</hi>; That day which is ſo terrible to the wicked, the very name of it is dreadful to them that bringeth much comfort to him who is loved of God; Now what a deſirable life is this, who would not give the whole world to enjoy it, <hi>viz.</hi> that he may walk in ſuch powerful apprehenſions of Gods favour, that though death come, though the day of judgement come, yet his heart is not terrified within him; The Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>Gods love perfected in us,</hi> 1 <hi>Jo.</hi> 4.12. that is, in reſpect of manifeſtation and diſcovery, as Gods power is ſaid <hi>to be perfected in our infirmities,</hi> or faith to be perfected by love, which ſheweth, that though God doth love us, yet till this be manifeſted and diſcovered to us, his love is not perfected to us.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſence and feeling of Gods love doth make us patient and contented, yea, even rejoycing under all tribulations, the more grudgings and diſcontents thou art aſſaulted with under any exerciſes, it's an argument thou haſt the leſs feeling of Gods love upon thee, for if this did diffuſe it ſelf, thou wouldſt be more then a conquerour in all theſe things, and certainly if <hi>Calvin</hi> ſaid gravely
<pb n="697" facs="tcp:65216:368"/>
from the former conſideration out of the place mentioned in <hi>John,</hi> That ſo far a man is proficient in faith as he is well compoſed in his heart for the expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the day of judgement; We may alſo ſpeak in this particular, that ſo far a man hath profited in Chriſtianity as he can from the ſence of Gods favour re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce and be above all tribulations whatſoever; This the Apoſtle mentioneth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.5. the cauſe of all thoſe glorious graces mentioned, <hi>viz.</hi> patience and glorying in tribulations, as alſo hope which <hi>will not make aſhamed,</hi> all cometh from that love of God ſhed abroad in their ſouls, and <hi>Rom</hi> 8 It's the love of God which he felt in his ſoul that made him triumph in ſo glorious a manner that he challengeth all things as not able to hinder him from this love of God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This ſence of Gods love is a notable inflamer and quickner of the heart un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all godlineſs, to all holy duties; How dull, how cold and lukewarm are all ſuch performances that flow not from this fire within? All is but formality and a meer outſide in Religion till we have ſome apprehenſion of Gods love toward us, yea, thoſe that are truly loved of God, but yet not aſſured of it, how hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily do they move in any holy duties, how ſad and divided with unbelieving thoughts, how prone to yield to ſuch temptations, that becauſe God doth not love them, therefore it's a vain thing to ſeek his face any longer, but if once God let this love ſhine in upon his heart, then it's like oyl to his bones, then it's like <hi>Ezechiels</hi> ſpirit in the wheels, then many waters cannot quench this love, So that any duty performed out of the apprehenſion of Gods love is in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect worth a thouſand of thoſe done without it; Oh therefore labour to keep this fire alwaies upon the Altar of thy heart, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14. the Apoſtle there ſaith that <hi>the love of Chriſt constraineth him,</hi> the word is thought to be uſed of thoſe Prophets who being immediatly wrought upon by the ſpirit of God, could not keep in what they felt, but they muſt deliver it, and thus it is with a man ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly poſſeſſed with the feeling of Gods love, he cannot keep it in, he is in an holy extaſie and raviſhment, he praieth, he heareth, he doth all things with all his might.</p>
            <p n="4">4 This apprehenſion of Gods love will make us wonderfull heavenly, It will take us from all things here below; As a man on a high tower thinketh great towns and cities but little things, thus a godly man raiſed up with the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of Gods love toward him, judgeth all the world but a drop to God; As the eye that hath looked on the Sun is ſo dazeled, that it cannot behold o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things; Thus it was with <hi>Paul,</hi> he was ſo affected with this, <hi>that Chriſt lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him and gave himſelf for him,</hi> Gal. 2.20. that he profeſſeth <hi>he did no longer live but Chriſt in him</hi>; It's this apprehenſion that will carry us up unto the mount of Transfiguration every day; It's no wonder then if Satan be ſo buſie to tempt us in this Point above all, to unſettle us about the love of God in Chriſt to us, for he knoweth herein lieth the ſtrength of <hi>Sampſon</hi> as it were, if this be taken away any green cords will tye him, he will not have ſtrength to overcome the leaſt temptation; But as long as this love of God can be preſerved and kept alive in the ſoul, ſo long neither the devil or the world is able to do us any hurt, ſo long we are like the bird flying on high that is not in danger of ſnares.</p>

            <p>THe ſenſe of Gods love in our hearts, is of ſuch conſequence, that our Saviour doth conclude his prayer with it; and as you have heard, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and bleſſed are the effects of it. I ſhall therefore in this laſt Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, give ſome <hi>Directive Helps, How to obtain and alwayes to preſerve this Aſſurance and Knowledge of Gods Love to us</hi>; but before we declare them, it's good to take notice of ſome particulars, that may rightly inform our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding in this point. And</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Propoſitions to inform in this point.</note>Firſt, You are to know, <hi>That it's the devils great work to keep the children of God in darkneſſe, and in continual doubtings.</hi> He is the tempter not only in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of luſts,<note place="margin">I.</note> but alſo unbelieving and diſtruſtfull thoughts of Gods grace and mercy. That as the work of Gods Spirit, is to comfort, called therefore a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter, as alſo to aſſure and witneſs unto us, <hi>That we are the children of God,</hi> yea to enable us to cry, <hi>Abba, Father:</hi> So on the contrary, Satan that unclean ſpirit, his whole buſineſs is, if he cannot tempt to ſin, yet to walk in a diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, tormenting and afflicted way, repreſenting God as ſome terrible Judge, catching at all the advantages to deſtroy us: Now the way that the devil takes thus to deject and ſadden the hearts of the godly is two-fold, for either he doth thus by ſuggeſtions immediately to the ſoul, taking the occaſion, when our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are darkned and clouded, or when God for holy ends hath withdrawn his light of favour from us; Or by his inſtruments, which he raiſeth up, he cauſeth ſuch tares of Doctrine to be ſown amongſt the good ſeed, that the childe of God ſhall not only walk without the perſwaſion of Gods favour, but think it is his duty, and that he is obliged to reject all ſuch comfortable thoughts; for certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this is one Doctrine of the devils, amongſt others in Popery, that they forbid the penitent ſoul any aſſurance or certainty of Gods favour, encouraging doubts as the mother of humility, keeping the humbled ſinner, as the devils did the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniack perſon among the tombs, in ſad and dolefull objects, not diſcovering to him the glorious and comfortable light of the Goſpel: So that in Popery it's one high point of Religion with them, that no man without an extraordinary revelation can attain to a certainty of Gods love to him; he may (they will grant) have ſome moral conjectures, but a certain perſwaſion cannot be ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily attained. But the Orthodox do abundantly confirm this truth againſt them: Therefore I only inſtance in their opinion, as an engine of Satan, whereby he would by this temptation take off the underſtanding, as by the former way he would unſettle the heart and affections. But let our wiſdom be, to take the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er diligence to keep that pearl, which we ſee Satan would ſo conſtantly rob us of.</p>

               <pb n="699" facs="tcp:65216:369"/>Secondly, Obſerve this,<note place="margin">II. Its poſſible for the ſenſe of Gods favour to conſiſt with ſome doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</note> 
               <hi>That it's poſſible for the ſenſe of Gods favour and love to conſiſt with ſome doubtings, and ſad ſhakings of heart about it at ſome times:</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as the light of the Sunne may make the day, yet at the ſame time, there be ſome dark and gloomy clouds, which though not able wholly to remove the Suns light, yet do in a great meaſure obſcure it; We ſee it in <hi>Davids</hi> Pſalms, ſome whereof you would think were not made by the ſame man at the ſame time, for happily in the beginning he had ſad dejecting and expoſtulating thoughts with God, and with his ſoul alſo, and yet ere the <hi>Pſalm</hi> be ended, he is able to break out in comfortable perſwaſions and aſſurances of Gods love: Inſomuch that as <hi>Paul</hi> findes <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. in reſpect of grace, a daily combate, ſo alſo in reſpect of certainty about Gods love; we believe, and yet crave help for our unbelief, and the word uſed by the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.19 <hi>We aſſure our hearts,</hi> is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, we perſwade our hearts, implying that our hearts have many objections and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils; ſo that this aſſurance comes by perſwaſion, even as the Greek word to comfort <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is uſed alſo to exhort, becauſe this conſolation is hardly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into the ſoul, there muſt be argument upon argument, exhortation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on exhortation, ere it will be ſatisfied. Do not therefore expect that, (which yet ſome vainly boaſt of) thou ſhouldſt alwayes walk in ſuch predominant aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Gods love, that there ſhould not any time ariſe the leaſt cloud or fear in thy ſoul; no, ſuch a bleſſed eſtate will only be in heaven.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">III. The ſenſe of Gods love may conſiſt with a feeling of a ſpiritual com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate within us</note> 
               <hi>Conſider that the ſenſe of Gods love may conſiſt with a feeling of a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual combate within us between the fleſh and the ſpirit.</hi> For this aſſurance of Gods favour doth not ariſe from a total abſence of all ſinne, that there is now no cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption in us at all, but from Gods gracious favour in Chriſt, pardoning thoſe reliques of corruption within us. It's not therefore the perfection of grace within us, that our ſenſe of Gods love is built upon, but the promiſe and truth of God in his Word; the not attending to this, hath made Gods children la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour under heavy and ſad burdens of minde; Oh they feel much corruption in themſelves, they daily finde ſtirrings of ſinne within them, by which means they are tempted to many doubts about Gods love towards them! But this is their infirmity? for did not <hi>Paul</hi> in a very grievous manner complain of <hi>the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of ſinne within him, that he found evil preſent with him, when he would do good, that he was a captive, even ſold under ſinne,</hi> and yet for all this he ſaith, <hi>I thank God through Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and concludeth, <hi>That there is no condemnation to him,</hi> yea for all this apprehenſion of ſinne in himſelf in the next Chapter, what a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Chariot of confidence is <hi>Pauls</hi> ſoul lifted up to heaven in? Doth he not challenge any adverſary in the world <hi>to ſeparate him from this love of God?</hi> Do not therefore make the ſenſe of ſinne, and the ſenſe of Gods favour immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oppoſite. Theſe Cautions being laid down,<note place="margin">Helps to get and keep this favour of God</note> let us take notice of <hi>the Helps and means, to get and keep this favour of God in the ſenſe of it upon our ſouls.</hi> And</p>
            <p n="1">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> 1. <hi>Be much in cheriſhing and nouriſhing the holy Spirit of God, which uſeth to breathe and work in thy ſoul.</hi> For ſeeing it's plain, that by Gods Spirit we are comforted, and that it only doth ſeal and witneſs unto us Gods love, that it's Gods Spirit which raiſeth up the ſoul to call God, <hi>Father:</hi> That man can never have aſſurance that grieveth this Spirit, that by any ſinne chaſeth it away. As <hi>Spira</hi> rebelling againſt the light of Gods Spirit (of whom yet judicious Divines give a charitable cenſure) uſed this expreſſion, <hi>If I could but feel one drop of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine clemency, and could but in the leaſt manner perceive God to be propitious to me (for even the very leaſt would be enough) I would not refuſe to endure a thouſand years or more in hell torments.</hi> Oh therefore fix that Exhortation upon thy heart, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.30. <hi>Grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are ſealed,</hi> &amp;c. So that the moſt compendious way to walk in this light of Gods favour, is to be much in prayer for the Spirit of God, for as that only can ſubdue corruptions which
<pb n="700" facs="tcp:65216:370"/>
are too ſtrong for us. Thoſe primitive Chriſtians, which did rejoyce in tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, and were <hi>endowed with joy unſpeakable and full of glory,</hi> it was, becauſe they were alſo at the ſame time full of the holy Ghoſt: If thou be lead by the Spirit, and walk in the Spirit, thou ſhalt have the comforts of the Spirit. Hence thoſe great learned men, who oppoſe this aſſurance, they go no higher then <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> ſchool, and ſeem to know no further then the efficacy of moral ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues: Thus they make not the Sun, but the Moon to rule the day.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> 2. Wouldſt thou enjoy this ſenſe of Gods favour? <hi>Then take heed of all ſinne, eſpecially ſuch as waſte the conſcience, and make a great gulf between thee and Gods favour.</hi> It's the conſtant Doctrine of the Scripture, that Gods anger is becauſe of ſin, that ſin only withholds all good from us: So that it's impoſſible to keep the ſenſe of Gods love, and wallow in ſin at the ſame time, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. <hi>Bleſſed are the pure in heart for they ſhall ſee God.</hi> The eye diſeaſed with corrupt humours cannot behold any comfortable object; ſo neither is a man polluted with ſin in a fit capacity for Gods love, for thoſe who thus taſte of Gods goodneſs, they are his favourites, they are admitted into his ſecret preſence: Now as a great Monarch would not endure, that a man in noiſome and loathſom apparel, and with the plague-ſores upon him, ſhould be admitted into near familiarity with him; ſo neither will God bid a prophane perſon draw nigh unto him, Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and a preſumption in ſinne cannot conſiſt together; When <hi>David</hi> had plunged himſelf into thoſe foul ſins, you ſee what darkneſs did cover him, immediately he complaineth for want of joy, that God had <hi>hid his face, that his bones were broken</hi>; and what was it but ſin, that did throw his ſoul into this hot fiery furnace.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> 3. <hi>Meditate much on Evangelical Truths, and the Goſpel-Doctrine that is deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in Scripture.</hi> For as it is the Law of God, as revealed in the Scripture, that makes a mans ſin to appear out of meaſure ſinful, by that pure glaſs he ſeeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf more monſtrous and deformed a thouſand times, then ever he apprehended himſelf: ſo by diligent inſpection into, and conſideration of the glorious things of the Goſpel, we ſee a more eaſie and more probable way for aſſurance of Gods love, then otherwiſe we would: It's not therefore the duty of Gods people to be only poring upon their ſins to be alwayes applying the Law to themſelves, but they are alſo to behold the glorious riches of Gods grace in the Goſpel. Though <hi>Paul</hi> was often caſt down with the ſenſe of his ſin, judging himſelf the chiefeſt of all ſinners, and leſs then the leaſt of all Saints, yet this doth not drive him from Chriſt, but rather the more to him: hence none ſpeaks ſo vigorouſly and cordially about Chriſt, as <hi>Paul</hi> doth. According to thoſe objects we often meditate upon, we are apt to be affected and even transformed into them: If therefore we deſire to know nothing, but Jeſus Chriſt crucified; if we daily poſſeſſe our ſelves with the unſpeakable love of Chriſt in dying for us; if we oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en are caught up into this Paradiſe, as it were, this love like fire will cauſe ſweet meltings and liquefactions of the ſoul; and if the cold, hard iron can by the fire be even aſſimulated unto it, ſo that its natural coldneſs and untractableneſs is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, it doth not ſo much appear iron as fire; no wonder if the gracious love of God plentifully poured out upon the ſoul, doth make the ſoul full of unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able joy and conſolations in the ſenſe of it. As therefore <hi>Abraham</hi> would not conſider the dead womb of <hi>Sarah,</hi> but the power and promiſe of God; ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do thou only conſider the guilt, and evil of thy ſoul, but alſo the glorious promiſes, and unſearchable riches of grace manifeſted in the Goſpel. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeaketh notably to this, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.17, 18. <hi>We all beholding as in a glaſſe, the glory of the Lord (viz.</hi> revealed in Chriſt by the Goſpel) <hi>are changed from glory to glory</hi> (from grace to grace) <hi>by the Spirit of God</hi>; that as in heaven, <hi>the bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifical viſion of God,</hi> doth fill the ſoul with all purity and joy: Thus the behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him by faith, as manifeſted in the Goſpel, doth produce lively and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial
<pb n="701" facs="tcp:65216:370"/>
refreſhments of ſoul by the ſenſe of his love.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Conſider that the apprehenſion and diſcovery of Gods love to thee, is far more noble and comfortable then the diſcovery of thy love to God.</hi> Thou mayeſt take far more joy in the ſenſe of Gods love to thee, then of thy love to God; for Gods love to thee is the fountain and womb of all the mercies thou enjoyeſt; were it not for Gods love to thee, thy love to him would not advantage thee at all. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, when thou diſcovereſt thy love to God, thou findeſt it clogged with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny imperfections, it may ſad and grieve thee, becauſe of the defects adhering thereunto, as well as encourage and comfort thee: But the love of God appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended is infinite and perfect, there are no imperfections at all; Gods love cannot be bettered and made a more noble and full love to thee. Again, thou needeſt Gods love, but he doth not need thine; he commands thee to love him, not that he wants thy love, or becauſe that can adde any thing to his happineſs, but becauſe thereby thou art made capable of his love, and ſo he can communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate of his goodneſs to thee, do not then take comfort ſo much from thy graces, as the evidence of Gods love to thee thereby.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Take notice that it's moſt acceptable and well-pleaſing unto God, that thou ſhouldſt walk in ſuch ſenſe and feeling of his goodneſs to thee.</hi> For why are all thoſe commands to rejoyce in him, and to bleſs his name continually? Why doth he invite thee to call him, Father? And why are there ſuch thunderbolts in the Scripture againſt unbelief and diſtruſt? Why is it the main ſcope of the Scripture to repreſent God under all love and loving conſiderations, but that all our thoughts of him ſhould be hopefull and comfortable? Do not therefore think thou goeſt beyond thy bounds, or it's preſumption in thee to draw nigh to God upon ſuch aſſured apprehenſions of his grace: No, the Scripture expreſly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the contrary, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.16. <hi>Let us come boldly unto the throne of grace</hi>; and <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.12. <hi>In whom we have boldneſs and acceſs with confidence by the faith of him.</hi> Hearken not then to all thoſe doubting temptations within, nor all thoſe deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full arguments of humane reaſon without, but conſider what the Scripture ſaith, and certainly it's prepoſterous humility, as in <hi>Peter,</hi> refuſing to let Chriſt waſh his feet, to keep off from the Throne of grace, when we are command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to come to it. Beſides, without this ſenſe of love, how can our hearts be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed up to bleſs and glorifie God? It was <hi>Davids</hi> apprehenſion of Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to him, that made him call upon his ſoul, and all within him to bleſs Gods holy Name.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>Conſider that this ſenſe of Gods love is the proper and genuine effect of faith in Chriſt, as a Mediator.</hi> Thus our Saviour doth here make it the conſequent of it, <hi>They have known me whom thou haſt ſent, that the love whereby thou loveſt me, may be in them.</hi> It's not enough to believe in the general, That Chriſt is a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator to ſuch as believe in him, but with <hi>Paul,</hi> Gal. 2.20. we are to appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate him, <hi>who loved me, and gave himſelf for me</hi>; with this Evangeliſt <hi>John,</hi> we are to lean our heads, as it were in Chriſts boſom; with <hi>Thomas</hi> we are to ſay, <hi>My God, and my Lord.</hi> Now the genuine, but not the neceſſary and inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable effect of ſuch an appropriating faith, is the ſenſe and aſſurance of Gods love to me in particular, which love of God is ſo attentive to one believer, as if there were no more in the world: As they ſay of the ſoul, it's <hi>tota in toto,</hi> and <hi>tota in qualibet parte,</hi> ſo is the love of God <hi>totus in univerſis fidelibus,</hi> and <hi>totus in ſingulis,</hi> God loveth a particular believer, as much as if there were no more believers in the world: Though the objects of his love may be diverſified, yet his love is not divided, or by diviſion diminiſhed.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, <hi>Fix this alwayes upon thy heart, that Chriſt hath prayed for this ſenſe of the Fathers love upon thy ſoul:</hi> You ſee in this prayer, where he mentioneth all the great and conſequential things unto believers, this is brought in at the laſt, as the adorning and ſweetning of all the reſt, for if ſanctified, if hereafter
<pb n="672" facs="tcp:65216:371"/>
to be glorified, if Chriſt be in us, and we in Chriſt, yet if the experimental knowledge and aſſurance of this be abſent, we are as the Diſciples under ſtorms and tempeſts, crying out, <hi>We periſh, we periſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let the ſummary Uſe of the whole be by way of <hi>Exhortation</hi> to all believers to hunger and thirſt, yea to have their ſouls break in longing after the enjoyment of this love of God in us: Oh bid all things ſtand aloof off, till thou art made partaker of it! Say, How long Lord, how long is it, that thou abſenteſt thy ſelf? When ſhall I have the imbracements of thy love? When will the glorious Sunne break out and diſpell all the dark clouds that are upon my ſoul? Give not over importuning for it: Becauſe of this very prayer of Chriſt, know to thy encouragement, that this prayer abideth for ever; Though it was once uttered by him upon the earth, and he ceaſed to pray any further, yet it ſtill liveth in the efficacy and power of it, yea that continual inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of his in heaven, what is it but the reviving of this prayer? So that by the vertue of this prayer through his blood we are ſanctified, we are juſtified, and ſhall hereafter be for ever glorified.</p>
