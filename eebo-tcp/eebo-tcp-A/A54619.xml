            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>OBSERVATIONS
UPON THE
CITIES
OF
LONDON and ROME.</head>
            <p>1. THAT before the year
1630, the Christnings at
<hi>London</hi> exceeded the Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials
of the same, but about the
year 1655 they were scarce half;
and now about two thirds.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:60318:3"/>2. Before the Restauration of
Monarchy in <hi>England, Anno</hi> 1660,
the People of <hi>Paris</hi> were more
than those of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Dublin</hi>
put together, whereas now, the
People of <hi>London</hi> are more than
those of <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> or of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi>
and <hi>Rouen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. <hi>Anno</hi> 1665 one fifth part of
the then People of <hi>London</hi> or 97
thousand died of the Plague, and
in the next year 1666, 13 thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Houses or one fifth part of
all the Housing of <hi>London</hi> were
burnt also.</p>
            <p>4. At the Birth of <hi>Christ,</hi> old
<hi>Rome</hi> was the greatest City of the
World, and <hi>London</hi> the greatest
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60318:3"/>
at the Coronation of King <hi>Iames</hi>
the Second, and near 6 times as
great as the present <hi>Rome,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
are 119 thousand Souls besides
<hi>Iews.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. In the years of King <hi>Charles</hi>
the Second his death and King
<hi>Iames</hi> the Second his Coronation
(which were neither of them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
for extraordinary Sickli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
or Healthfulness) the Burials
did wonderfully agree, <hi>viz. Anno</hi>
1684, they were 23202, and
<hi>Anno</hi> 1685 they were 23222, the
<hi>Medium</hi> whereof is 23212. And
the Christnings did very wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
agree also, having been <hi>Anno</hi>
1684, 14702, and <hi>Anno</hi> 1685,
14732, the <hi>Medium</hi> whereof is
14716, which consistence was
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60318:4"/>
never seen before, the said num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of 23212 Burials making the
People of <hi>London</hi> to be 696360,
at the rate of one Dying <hi>per an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi>
out of 30.</p>
            <p>6. Since the great Fire of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
Anno</hi> 1666 about 7 parts of
15 of the present vast City hath
been new built, and is with its
People increased near one half,
and become equal to <hi>Paris</hi> and
<hi>Rome</hi> put together, the one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Seat of the great <hi>French</hi>
Monarchy and the other of the
Papacy.</p>
