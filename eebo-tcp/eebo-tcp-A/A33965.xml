            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

THE

A
BULL-DOG.</head>
            <head type="sub">Or a short Reply to ABSALON and ACHITOPHEL.</head>
            <l>IN pious times when Poets were well bang'd</l>
            <l>For sawcy Satyr and for Sham-Plots hang'd,</l>
            <l>A Learned Bard, that long commanded had</l>
            <l>The trembling Stage in Chief, at last run mad,</l>
            <l>And Swore and tore and ranted at no rate.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Apollo</hi> and his <hi>Muses</hi> in debate</l>
            <l>What to do with him, one cry'd, let him Blood,</l>
            <l>That says, another will do little good;</l>
            <l>His Brains infected sure, under his Nose</l>
            <l>We'le burn some Feathers of <hi>Peru,</hi> who knows</l>
            <l>But that may bring him to himself again?</l>
            <l>Ay, for some time says <hi>Clyo;</hi> she was more</l>
            <l>For <hi>Opiates,</hi> others for <hi>Hellebore.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>Apollo</hi> having heard all they could say,</l>
            <l>Rose up and thankt them said, he'de try a way</l>
            <l>He hop'd would do, then call'd a Noble Friend</l>
            <l>Well verst in Men, and beg'd of him to spend</l>
            <l>Some time and pains upon this wretch, which he,</l>
            <l>Agreeing to, went presently to work,</l>
            <l>Open'd his head, saw where the Maggots lurk;</l>
            <l>Took many of them out, put them in Sut,</l>
            <l>Then Added <hi>Mercury</hi> and <hi>Nitre</hi> to't,</l>
            <l>Mixt and infus'd them well, and after all,</l>
            <l>Distil'd them in a Limbeck Comical,</l>
            <l>And drew a Spirit very Soveraign,</l>
            <l>For those are troubled with the fitts o'th Brain,</l>
            <l>And gave our Poet some, all he could make</l>
            <l>The peevish, Squeamish, self-wil'd Coxcomb take.</l>
            <l>It did him good and cur'd him of those Fitts:</l>
            <l>But 'twas too little to restore his Wits:</l>
            <l>For since he has gin' ore to Plague the Stage</l>
            <l>With the effects of his Poetick rage,</l>
            <l>Like a mad Dog he runs about the Streets,</l>
            <l>Snarling and Biting every one he meets.</l>
            <l>The other day he met our Royal <hi>CHARLES,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And his two Mistresses, and at them Snarles.</l>
            <l>Then falls upon the Ministers of State</l>
            <l>Treats them all A-la mode <hi>de Billingsgate:</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:59694:2"/>
But most of all, the glory of our gown,</l>
            <l>He must be bark't at, Drivil'd, pist upon.</l>
            <l>He whose soft tongue had charmes enough t'asswage</l>
            <l>The Tygers fierceness, could not scape the rage</l>
            <l>Of this same whifling Cur; poor Cerberous,</l>
            <l>That taught the Rogue to bark, was serv'd just thus.</l>
            <l>This Vipers brood, contrary to all Laws,</l>
            <l>The torn out Entrails of his Parent knaws.</l>
            <l>He gives no quarter, spairs no friend, nor foe,</l>
            <l>And where he once gets hold, never lets go</l>
            <l>Until he breaks a tooth, which he hath done</l>
            <l>So oft of late, that he hath few or none</l>
            <l>Left in his mouth. Nay which is worst of all</l>
            <l>On his Physician he does always fall,</l>
            <l>And find him out where e're he is and bawl</l>
            <l>Eternally, taking in Evil part</l>
            <l>What he good man did by the rules of art,</l>
            <l>And for his good, assisted by a Set</l>
            <l>Of the most able Leeches he could get;</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Apollo</hi> vext to see there was no more</l>
            <l>Effect of Medicine, bid his friend give o're,</l>
            <l>And sent some Chirurgions to him to anoint</l>
            <l>The Carcase of the whelp in every Joynt</l>
            <l>With Oyl of Crab-tree, than which nothing fetches</l>
            <l>The itching Venome out of Scribling Wretches</l>
            <l>Better or sooner, but I know not how</l>
            <l>It came to pass, with him it would not do.</l>
            <l>For since his being anointed, he is run</l>
            <l>Yelping with Towser up and down the Town,</l>
            <l>And crying out against an <hi>Absalon</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And an <hi>Achitophel.</hi> The Currs had got</l>
            <l>Between them in their Mouthes a new Sham-Plot,</l>
            <l>The Twentieth of the Kings, some say indeed</l>
            <l>It is the same that Mother <hi>Celier</hi> hid,</l>
            <l>Deep in the Meal-tub, only new lick't o're</l>
            <l>And brought to better shape by half a score</l>
            <l>Of <hi>Irish</hi> Mongrels, newly fetcht from thence,</l>
            <l>The best in <hi>England</hi> at an Evidence.</l>
            <l>A little bribe will make them sware devoutly,</l>
            <l>They're much more famous for their swearing stoutly,</l>
            <l>Then for their fighting so, this kind of Cattel</l>
            <l>Are better far at Roguery than Battel.</l>
            <l>An <hi>Irish</hi> man's Antiwood-cock, cares</l>

            <l>This Copper coyn will never with us pass,</l>
            <l>It looks so scurvily, nay it smells of Brass;</l>
