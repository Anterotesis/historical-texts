            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

We confesse Originall sinne because we dare not deny it; <hi>We avow that it hath bereft us of Grace, but assure our selves that it hath left us an entire Liberty; We confesse it hath robb'd us of our innocencie, but maintain that we may recover our innocencie by the means of reason, and that if we cannot merit heaven, we may at least secure our selves from hell:</hi> We admire the famous Actions of Infidels; our eyes are dazl'd with the lustre they receive from the writings of Phylosophers; we side, at unawares, with Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture against Grace, and through an inconsiderate zeale: We will have their delusive vertues rewarded with a true happinesse.</p>
               <p>Yet notwithstanding to believe original sin, is one of the prime Articles of our Faith; if <hi>Adam</hi> were not guilty; Jesus Christ was not necessary; and if Humane nature be yet in her first purity, it's in vain that we seek a Saviour: Hence <note n="b" place="margin">In causa duo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum hominum quorum per u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuro venum de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisumus sub pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cato, per <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Church confirmes this truth unto us, by as many Paradoxes, as the instructions are, which she giveth us. And knowing that her words serves for laws unto her Children, she is pleased to tell us, that <hi>Adam's</hi> sin is ours, That the miseries which we undergoe, are the punishments of his disobedience, That Divine Justice hath condemned us in Him: That our misfortune and His sinne did precede our Birth, And that contrary to all the Laws of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, we be guilty before we are reasonable. Faith perswades us to these Truths, and without troubling our selves to seek Proofs to strengthen them, we in all humility believe what we cannot evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know; But because Phylosophy is a Rebel to Faith, and that she is more swayd by reason, then by the Authority of the Church, I will convince her by reason, and make her confess, that we could not be irregular, if we were not guilty.</p>
               <p>All Phylosophers confess, <note n="d" place="margin">Princeps &amp; Domina carnis naturaliter ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma est quae do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mare carnem debet &amp; regere. <hi>August. contra Julian, lib. 2. cap.</hi> 8.</note> That man is Composed of a body &amp; soul, And that when Divine Providence did first forme him, she mingled Beast with Angell, and that she gathered Heaven and Earth together to finish her Noblest piece of workmanship. If Passion have not prevail'd over reason in these great men, they must confess that when God did this his Chiefest work, he did so well accord the two Parts which went to the Composition thereof, as that the body obey'd the soul, &amp; the Angell comanded over the Beast. They must acknowledge that God observ'd the same Order in the Composing of man, as he did in the making of the world, and that as he submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Earth to the Influences of the Heavens, he did likewise as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>subject Passion to reason, and the Appetite to the will. And since they observe this decent order to be no longer kept, they ought ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily to infer, that sin is the cause thereof, And that man hath lost these advantages only because he hath not preserved his Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency.

bad Habits, that our faults precede evill examples, that we know what evill is, not having learned it, and that the soul follows the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations of her body, before she hath tasted the delights thereof: whence is it, that sin is naturall to us, that in us it preceeds the use of reason, that notwithstanding all its deformities, it becomes pleasing, and that vertue with all her comlinesse seem austere unto us. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, he who shall conceive aright, the reason thereof, will be obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged either to blame Divine Providence, or els to condemne the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of the first man, who losing originall Justice, deprived all his Children thereof, And who making us inherit his disorders, made us criminall, before rationall.</p>
               <p>The Morall Vertues, which Phylosophers boast so much off, doe authorize the beleife of originall sin. For though they perswade themselves, that man by the assistance thereof may overcome sin; and that God did not Compose him of two rebellious Parts, save only to increase his merit, and to leave unto him the glory of finish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it; yet the use of vertue doth sufficiently prove his irregularity, and it is sufficient to acknowledge that he was born guilty, since we know he is obliged to become vertuous. For vertue is not a producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Nature, but an invention of Art, she is not infused, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, and the Pains she causeth, fully equall the Pleasures which she promiseth. She presupposeth that man is out of order, since she hath a design to reforme him, and that he is sick since she endeavours to cure him. All her exercises are so many Combats, all her enemies are born in the very Place where she sets upon them, and the industry she is forced to make use off to drive them thence, doth sufficiently witness that they govern there before her; in effect man is weak, before he hath acquired fortitude, he is foolish before wise, and ere temperate, unchast, his vertues are proofs of his vices, his last victories are signes of his former defeats, and the succour which he is enforced to seek for, from without himselfe, is a witness of his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order and weakness.

               <p>This generall insurrection is a token and punishment of his offence, had he preserved his integrity he had never lost his Authority, and had he not falne from his innocency he had never forgon his Throne. Phylosophy as haughty as she is, cannot deny but that man is the prey of wild beasts, and the victime of their fury, that he is exposed to the rigour of the Aire, and to the unseasonableness of the weather, she must confess that he hath no subject which is not rebellious, that there is no place within his Territories which is not his enemy, and there is no part of his body which is not either disobedient or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfull to him, whence proceeds this disorder, if not from his sin whence proceeds so universall a rebellion, if not from his disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and why should he have lost his authority in the world, if he had not lost his innocency, which was the foundation thereof, I ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well know that Phylosophers who knew not the state of sin, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to excuse this insurrection, alledging it is naturall, but who sees not the excusing of man, is to blame God, and that to leave innocency, to the Creature, is to bereave God of his Providence:

to know that the Creature cannot equall the Creator in Majestie, that the degrees of their separation are infinite, and that wishes are never made for things absolutely impossible, how could that desire of making himself God, ever enter into the imagination of an Angell; Since <hi>Theologie</hi> confesseth that they could never suspect the Mystery of the Incarnation, and that without being enlightned by Glory or by Faith, they never could have thought that God could make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self man, or man become God; other Divines have therefore rather chosen to believe, that the Mysterie of the Incarnation, was the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of the Angels sin, and that having learnt by Revelation, that God was to allye himself to humane Nature, he could not tolerate that the Angelicall Nature should be deprived of this honour; imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that the Angels did very well deserve whatsoever dignity God would confer upon man.</p>

If it be not rashnesse to go about to discover what our leaders have been ignorant of, and if a man may divide that which hath neither parts nor moments, I would say that the sin of man, and of the Angell is neither single, nor yet Composed of all sins: as S. <hi>Augustine</hi> affirmeth, weaknesse which is so naturall to the Creature, was, as it were, the disposition thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, negligence the beginning, self-love the ensuing, or progresse, and Pride the accomplishment thereof; weaknesse is so naturall to the Creature, as to free it thereof, it must suffer change and be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed above itself; Grace, (whose effects are so many miracles) dares not undertake to free the Creature from it: there is nothing but Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry which can fix the fancy of the Creature, and take from it that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constancy which is the cause of all it's offences. We acknowledge none but Jesus Christ to be void of sin; The Angell, and man, not being raised to this height of happinesse, we must not wonder if they be fallen, and if those which proceeded <hi>ex nihilo,</hi> did not defend themselves from sin, every perishable Creature may become Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minall,

that which may lose its being may lose Grace, and what cannot preserve it selfe in Nature, will have much a doe to preserve it selfe in innocencie. Weaknesse then prepared that Angel and man to sin, and these two noble Creatures became faulty, only because they were not unchangeable, negligence begun the fault which weaknesse had prepared, they made not use of all the grace which they had received, they left a <hi>vacuum</hi> in their being which made place for sin, they did not employ all the advantages which they had received from God, and deserved to lose them, for having neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected them, as this fault was yet but an omission, it might have been expiated by humility, and by abasing themselves before God, it may be they might have obteined pardon, they became Idolaters at unawares, and framed vain Idols to themselves out of the workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of God. This fault was already well grown, and the Angel and men were guilty of having turned their eyes from Divine perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to settle them upon their own advantages, yet did they only love those beauties which God had placed in them, they might have adored his Image in these Looking-glasses, and have returned to the Spring-head by these Rivolets, and by these beams have raised themselves up to the Sun: but Pride finished their fault, they grew proud of Gods favours, their vain-glory proceeded from his grace; that which should have submitted them to their Creator, was cause of their Rebellion, and the more they were beholding unto him, the lesse were they acknowledging from the times they thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves able to reigne without him, they would reign in despight of him, and as soon as they had raised up a Throne unto themselves, they would have Subjects, the Angel got a party in heaven, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched some of his companions, hee made slaves of his equals, and these excellent Spirits were not ashamed to adore a creature; which though it were more elevated, was not lesse dependent upon God then were the rest: Rebellion did not, not withstanding, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perse it self throughout all their Orders, the number of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full exceeded that of the revolters: <hi>Michael</hi> couragiously opposed himselfe to <hi>Lucifer,</hi> and be it that he made good use of his graces, or that he received addition thereunto, he kept the greater part of the Angels in their obedience, and drove the Rebels from the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyerean Heaven.

himselfe to his blinde fury, those who lived in him, and descended from him, were guilty of his Rebellion, they lost themselves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with their unfortunate Father; they suffered for a sin which they could not hinder; they found themselves engaged in death, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they knew life, and wondered that not being reasonable, they were already criminall. This sin which shed it self like a contagion became the Spring-head of errour in the World. The greatest part of Hereticks have withstood it, and the pride of Phylosophy, wherewith they were puft up, would not permit them to confesse a disorder, which would have forced them to be humble; Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks believe it, though they conceive it not; Faith teacheth them what reason cannot perswade them unto, and they care not though they be esteemed ignorant, so long as they may be esteemed faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: They finde by experience that man is become guilty, but they know not how he hath contracted this crime, they dispute not the maladie, but cannot comprehend by what secret wayes the Father hath communicated it to his children, and the children have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it from their father: This is that which we will examine in the pursuit of this Treatise.</p>

               <p>If it be wonderfull by reason of it's Effusion, it is no less miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous through it's other qualities; for we are taught by Divinity that it is voluntary in the Father, and naturall in the Children; that that which was only a fault in <hi>Adam,</hi> is both a sin and a punishment in those that descend from him, that we contract by birth what he willingly committed: and that that which was free in it's beginning should become necessary in the progress thereof; He might have kept from disobedience: And we can neither shun the punishment nor the fault: we are surprized by this misfortune in our Conception we are slaves before we have the use of Liberty, and we have already offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded God before we knew him; we are rather, the objects of his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, then of his mercy; but that which is more deplorable, we are so corrupted from the moment of our Birth, as that we oppose our selves to his will.

The greatest part of our thoughts are so many undertakings against his Authority: our actions are attempts against his graciousnesse: and not withstanding any Inclination that we have to love him tis almost impossible for us without his grace, to keep from offending him, the body punisheth the soul for her offence, it revengeth God for the outrages the soul hath done him; and taking example from the souls rebellion dispenseth with its obedience thereunto: nay, it doth oft-times change its rebellion into tyranny, the Slave becomes his Sovereigns Master, and either by fair means or by foul, forceth him to serve his disorders, then doth the soul descend from her greatnesse, Labours only for the pleasures of the body, and imployes all her an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages to procure new delight, unto her slave.

And Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> who hath drawn all his Doctrine from Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> words, instructeth the whole Church that the faults which wee detest are not so much the effects as the proprieties of self love. In effect, is not Avarice, an unjust love of riches, is not Pride an unjust love of Honours, is not opiniatrecie a furious love to be always victorious, is not colour a detestable love of revenge? And to conclude all in a few words; are not all sins as many different loves which changing rather countenance then humour: agree all in a designe of fastning themselves to objects which they like, and of keeping a loofe off, from such as they like not.

Self love takes a clean opposite way, from that of charity, and by direct contrary traces, endeavours to estrange man from God, and to fasten him to himselfe, or to the Creature: it effaceth as much as it is able, the inclination which his soule hath for the <hi>Summum Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num:</hi> if it cannot stifle it, it diverts it; and seeing that the heart of man cannot be without imployment it lays before him the beauty of the Creatures, to divert him from those of the Creatour; being accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with blindnesse and pride, it easily abuseth the soule which it possesseth, and figuring out the perfections thereof more glorious then they are; it makes her, her own Idolater; it raiseth her incensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly up to the height of impiety, and by different steps mounts it even to the hatred of God, for as the faithful man is perfect when he loves God, even to the pitch of hating himself, the sinner even hath the measure of his sin filled up when he loves himselfe, even to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of hating God.

But as she sees her wishes are uselesse, she endeavours to increase the number of Divine lovers, to the end that making amends for her indigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, they may love him with all their might whom she cannot sufficiently love. Self love in opposition to this, which obligeth man to make a god of himselfe, inspires him with a desire to make himselfe be beloved of all the world.

Men discover the perfection of their minds to make themselves ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired, women make the most they can of their bodily beauty to make them be adored, but the one and the other of them will have their malady turn contagious, and spread abroad the poyson of self-love which hath infected them, into the souls of all those that come neer them.</p>

Self-love, which succeeded the love to God, spread it self abroad in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to three as impure rivolets, as was the spring head from whence they did derive: the first was call'd the love of Pleasure, <note n="s" place="margin">In omnibus illecebris mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di hujus tria sant aut volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas aut curiosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas aut super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia. <hi>Aug. in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend.

Voluptuousnesse or the love of pleasure, resides in the senses, and reigns in all the parts of the body which are capable of delight, the soul engageth her self in the eyes and ears, to tast the contentments which these two senses can wish for, she renounceth spirituall delights, to seek out such as are sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suall, and as if she were now no longer a pure spirit, she longs after nothing but bodily delights. Necessity is no longer the rule of her desires, she betakes her self no more to objects, for that they are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, but for that they are pleasing. Temperance useth her utmost endeavour to withstand this irregularity; she endeavours to passe by all voluptuousnesse, without any stay, and to make use of such reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies as Nature hath ordained for the cure of our maladies, without the engagement of her aff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

To vanquish it a man must have no more a body, and changing condition with Angels, hee must become a pure spirit; but to boot with our loving this part of our selves, the occasions of Combats are so frequent, as we are oft in one and the same day both Conquerours and conquered: the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of vain glory are not so common, if we be blinded by our ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginarie greatnesse, we are humbled by our reall miseries, and we must have forgotten the shame of our birth if we glory in any thing during our life: Though the desire of knowledge awakens our curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>osity, and that the very ignorance whereinto we are plunged, obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth us to seek out a diversion, in the knowledge of worldly things, yet the difficulties which accompanies.

We love rather to be kept in ignorance, then to be freed therof by study, we cannot resolve upon the getting of a fleece, where the Pains exceeds the Glory, and where the Reward equals not the Labour: but Voluptuousnesse is as easie as delightfull, it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents it self unsought for, and is received without difficulty, if we must fight for it, tis when Jealousie or Ambition makes themselves of the Partie; and that they Corrupt the sweetnesse of our delights by the vain-Glory of their designes, and moreover, Nature having mingled delight with all her remedies, we must always stand upon our guard, that we build not our felicity one things which she gives us only for our Consolation. It is hard to discern whether we eat more out of Pleasure, or necessity; a man must be very moderate, to seek for nothing more in sleep, then the refreshing of the body, and the repairing of our forces; we must have already made many a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat, to effect nothing more in Marriage then the preservation of our Families, thus do great Saints confess tis easier to bereave ones self of Pleasures, then to regulate them, and that there goes more of worth to moderate these pleasing Enemies, then to stifle them; tis easier to fast, then to feed sparingly of dainty viands, and the good use of riches is more rare then voluntary Poverty.

are not soundly grounded in the Faith of Jesus Christ: yet this great Doctor avoucheth two or three maximes, which may pacifie the mind of man, and which prove cleerly enough that there is no sinner who is not miserable.</p>
               <p>To understand his Doctrine we must know that <note n="l" place="margin">Omnis animae poenoe &amp; prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mium semper aliquid consert justa pulchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudini disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionique rerum omnium. <hi>Aug. lib. de quantit. animae, cap.</hi> 56.</note> Punishment and reward go to the making up of one part of the worlds beauty; and that as Vertue deserves some Pay, sin likewise deserves some Punishment. It would be unreasonable if the just man should not be recompenced, and Irregular, if the guilty should not be punished. Divine justice is answerable to these two sorts of men, and as the great <hi>Tertullian</hi> says, she is no lesse obliged to Erect Heaven for the good, then to make Hell for the wicked; that Divine perfection, which maintains the order of the world never overthrows this: Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue receiveth always her reward, and vice is never exempt from Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment; they do not only follow, but accompany one another, and as the <hi>Epicurians</hi> did not believe that delight could be seperated from vertue, Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> did not believe that Punishment could be parted from sin. This effect is always found with it's cause, and man can no sooner Commit an offence but he presently becomes sensible of the Punishment. There is an <note n="m" place="margin">Lex aeterna &amp; summa ratio cui semper ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperandum, illa est per quam mali miseram, boni beatam vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam merentur, nec enim inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stum esse potest ut mali miseri, boni beati sint. <hi>Aug. lib. 1. de lib. arbit. cap.</hi> 6</note> Eternall law which will have good men happy, and the wicked miserable, it neither defers reward nor Punishment, and without putting off the Punishment to Hell, or the reward to Heaven, it confers them both on earrh,; God hath made some laws which alters with the times; though he be in himself always the same, yet he accommodates himself somtimes to his handy-worke, and oft times repeals the Decrees which he hath pronounced, but the law which regards vertue, and vice is immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and the ugliness of an offence never goeth without the beauty of Punishment, nor doth sin ever enter into <note n="n" place="margin">Nunquam accidit ut sit in anima dedecus peccati sive de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>core vindicta. <hi>August.</hi>

Favourites will not out-live their Masters favours, the Magnificence of their Palaces, the number of their meniall servants, the greatnesse of their offices, cannot charme their sorrow; they are pleased with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing because their Prince is offended: all their contentments cannot countervail the losse of his Favour, and his wrath is a Punishment, which all the reasons of Phylosophy cannot sweeten: if experience teacheth us that banishment and losse of Favour are Punishments, shall we doubt whether he that is not upon good Terms with God, be upon bad terms with himselfe or no? and can we think him happy who through his own default hath lost the well spring of true Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse? the sinner then is miserable; and if men esteeme them hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py amongst so many sufferings, It is for that they do not know wherein happinesse consists.

Phylosophers agree in this truth, the light of reason hath made us know, that Punishment presuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth sin; the Ignorance of our Miseries hath perswaded them, that man was punisht on earth, for sins that he had committed in heaven, that his body was his souls prison, and that she was deteined there to expiate the faults which she only had committed. Though these be not so pure truths but that they have an intermixture of Errour, yet they teach us that sin precedes Punishment, and that mans misery doth assuredly witness his offence. For what likely-hood is there that Divine Providence would have condemned man to so much misery without a fault, wherefore should the body rebell against the soul, whereunto it is united: Wherefore should man be compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed of Parts which cannot agree? and why should the workmanship of God be out of order were it not corrupred by the sin of man.

I should be too tedious if I would perticularize in all the souls advantages, the rest of this discourse must be imployed in shewing what out rages she receiveth from sin; for as soon as she took up her lodging, she became slave to the body; she lost her Power when she lost her Innocence, when she ceased to obey, she ceased to command, and as if obedience had been the foundation of all her greatnesse, rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion was the cause of her miseries, of all the cognizances whichwere together with Grace infused into her, none remain'd in her but doubts and jealousies, which makes her as oft embrace fals-hood as truth; though she know God: she adores the workmanship of his hands, her enlightnings detein her not from engaging her self in errour, and the great Inclination which she hath for the <hi>Summum Bonum</hi> doth not estrange her from the love of perishable things, she is the Image of God; and ceaseth to resemble him, she expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth his greatnesse, and doth no longer imitate his vertues, she con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves the Trinity of her power in the unity of her essence, yet can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conceive one God in three Persons, she makes and Idol unto her self of every Creature, all that pleaseth her seem Gods unto her, her Interest is the soul of her Religion, her love ariseth from fear, she adores whatsoever she fears, and unlesse the God which she serveth had thunders wherewithall to punish her she would have no victimes to load his Altars withall.</p>
               <p>Her Punishment is the Picture of her offence, she meets with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion in her slave; the conspiracy of all the parts of her body is generall; her senses do seduce her, Her Passions do torment her, her Imagination troubles her, and her subjects do despise her, she sees her self obliged to encourage their disorders to give life to Rebels, which justle her Authority, to nourish up monsters which rend her in peices, and to arme souldiers which plunder her estate, but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ads more unto her Pain; then the love which she bears her e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, for though he prosecute her, she cannot resolve to hate him &amp; dares not make War against him without assistance from heaven: this Traitor is so full of cunning as he makes himself be beloved by her

whom he abuseth, she is sensible of all the evils that he endures, and as if her pain arose from her love; she never ceased to suffer since she began to love him, she apprehends her slaves miseries more then her own; she fears death more then sin, she is more affraid of ruine then of falshood, and as if this inclination had changed her Nature, she desires no other good, nor dreads no other evill, then what is sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible: Musick charms her discontents, Pictures serve her for a diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, she is pleased with smels, and the greatest part of her delights consists in what contents her senses, by a sequell as shamefull as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, she is burnt by Feavers, pained by the Gout, weakened by sicknesse, and whatsoever hurteth her body, abaseth her cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage.</p>

Thus our misfortunes drive equally from these two, and if the soul made our first father guilty, It is the body which makes his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren unfortunate; yet must we avow that the soul is the greater Delinquent in us as well as in him, for if she have no freedom to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend her self against Originall sin, and if necessity may excuse a misfortune which is not voluntary, she is more guilty then the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, because she commits so many faults with delight, stays not for being solicitated by the senses, and that by a blind Impetuosity, she willingly embraceth whatsoever is pleasing unto her, she ads vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary sins, to sins of Nature, and will have that of her faults, some be the effects of her misfortune; and others, of her lewdness.</p>
               <p>In fine, it seems that those that follow her motions endevour to exceed the sin of their birth by the sins of their life, and as if they thought it an offence to be more innocent then their Father, they strive to be more faulty then hee who committed all the sins in the world; when he made all that descended from him Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall.</p>

                  </note> the service she had from thence made her love her Quarter; the Chains wherewith they were united were so strong, as nothing but sin, could breake them, their Inclinations in the difference of their Nature, were so conformable, as whatsoever pleased the one, did not dislike the other: the body by an admirable prodigie heighthned it's self into the souls Employments without violence, and the soul deigned to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit her self to the necessities of the body, without injury to her self, she found no difficulty in all she did, and if the body were not ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to her in her more noble works; yet did it not resist her therein, their contentments were Common, and as the soul was not subject to sorrow; neither did the body feel any pain. This happy Condition lasted no longer then the time of Innocency; when man once lost his righteousnesse, he lost his happinesse: and when he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Criminall, he became miserable, the soul went less in her great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, and this living Image of the Divine Essence, saw her self brought to such misery, as may better be exprest by tears then words; nothing remain'd intire in man, and the outrages of sin dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persed themselves into all the parts of the body, the understanding was darkned, the memory weakned, and the will depraved.

               <p>To conceive her corruption, we must of necessity comprehend her purity, and observe the Effects which Originall righteousnesse wrought in the soul: the first was, that notwithstanding her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing engaged in a body, she ceased not to be spirituall, her Functions made her not <hi>Animale,</hi> and though united to the body by Grace; yet was she not thereby a Prisoner, she communicated her perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to it, and shared not in it's defects, she was free though bound; her body <note n="o" place="margin">Tunc corpus non erat carcer animae ut som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niavit <hi>Pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>To all these evils that the soul of our first Father suffered after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving sinned, our disorders have added some more direfull; for the soul seems only to be fastened to her body, that she may undergo a thousand Punishments. Death presents himself before her, in a thousand dreadfull shapes, every sicknesse is a Torment, every part of the body is a place where Pain may assail her, the remedies which she seeks for to cure her, are new pains, and the very vertues which she cals in to her ayd, are so austeer, as they oft times send her back to despair; sometimes she changeth her disease into a reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, &amp; by an extravagancy which Nature teacheth her, she makes use of the rigour of death against the miseries of life.

But the rigour of our Punishment is the more augmented in that the understanding is enjoyned to employ unfaithfull Officers to be instructed by ignorant Masters and to be led by blind guides. In the state of Innocence, truth was written by the hand of Nature in the bottom of our soule, knowledge was thereinto infused, and was not seduced by the senses, the soul learnt nothing of them, which shee knew not before of her self, she was wise without trouble or errour, and if she made triall of her eyes or eares, 'twas rather for recreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then necessity: but now Ignorance reigns in our understanding, and to overcome this Monster, we must make use of our senses which hold intelligence with it. What Victory can a Prince hope for, who employs Rebels to defend his State, or to fight against his enemies, and what good success can mans understanding hope for, which is necessitated to be instructed by Masters which are as ignorant as its self, the senses perceive but the appearances of things, their substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are unknown unto them, their operations are uncertain, and they stand in need of Air or Light to be inform'd of the Truth. Tis true that the understanding examines their reports, but what judgement can one expect from one that is ignorant; what decree can a blinde Judge pronounce, who is instructed: only by corrupted witnesses? who sees not that this manner of proceeding is too severe not to be a punishment, and who will not confess that man is faulty, since he is so unhappy.</p>
               <p>Those who undertake to defend him, say that the Understanding knows the Truth, by instinct, that it is knowing without Art, and that as little Birds know their Dams by the voice, the understanding discerns Truth from Falshood, and by a naturall judgement, embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth the one; and rejectes the other: but to boot that it is a kind of <note n="c" place="margin">Naturalium scientia ne in bestiis quidem deficit. <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de anima.</hi>

it, we must confesse that Ignorance and weaknesse, are equally naturall to us: the first is seen in all actions, Nature, Morality, and Religion furnish us with as many proofs thereof as they give us In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions.</p>
               <p>For though Nature be not jealous of her works, though she free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expose all her beauties to our eyes, and that she discover unto us her rarest products, who is he that knoweth all her secrets? though the heavens be extended over our heads, who knows whereof they be Composed? though the Sun rise, and set every day, who knows his Influences, and Motions? though the earth bring forth her flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers under our feet, and ripens her fruit before our eyes, who knows what art it useth to give them their severall colours? who knows by what secret vertue Nature changeth earth into gold, and taking from it's impurity, gives it that glittering Lustre, which makes the finall ornament of all our workmanship? Who can comprehend how the dew congeals into pearl, how the water thickens into Chrystall, and how becomming solid, it continues still transparent? who can give a reason for these naturall Miracles, which we neglect only because they are too common? who knows why straw being so Cold as that it preserves Ice in the midst of Summer, is yet so hot as that it ripens fruit even in the midst of winter? Doth not Amber and the Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone make all Phylosophers wild? and these Miracles which come so neer our senses, do they not confound our understanding? we see all things, that know nothing; we have the use of the Elements, but not the knowledge of them; Whatsoever entertains our vanity, accuseth us of blindnesse, and whatsoever serves for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version to our eyes or ears upbraids our understanding with Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
               <p>Morality confirms this truth as well as Nature doth: for though she undertake to enlighten mans understanding, and to rule his will, though she boast to make man an Angell, and to take from him all the feelings of the flesh and bloud, doth she not lay open unto him his ignorance, when she instructeth him and doth she not shew that he is blind, in offering her self to be his Guide and Mistris? tis true that he may glory, that he himself hath formed her who teacheth him, and to be his Mistresses Master, since she hath no Maximes, which are not the inventions of the understanding. But this his vain glory is very is very ill grounded; and Morality is a bad proofe of

Tis true she is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally blind, and that it is as much out of her power to know the truth, as for the understanding to love vertue, but she was assured of her officers fidelity, the senses were not unfaithfull, nor the Passions wild, the imagination was not troubled, nor the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing darkned, shee lived in a peaceable condition, she neither feared her Enemies, nor distrusted her Subjects, but now she is shie of them all; the senses will deceive her, the Passions revolt, her Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination is confounded, the understanding goes about to corrupt her, and amidst so many disorders, she hath but a weak inclination to Good, which to say truth, doth never abandon her. We must more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over confesse that this inclination is much weakened by sin, and that it is a kind of Miracle if it be not corrupted.</p>

The Angels find their happinesse in possessing him, and the Devils their misfortune in losing him, they cannot chuse but wish him, and how maliciously so ever their will be bent, it always languisheth after the <hi>Summum Bonum.</hi> If they could be without love; they would be without sorrow, nor would they be sensible of their losse, could they suffer it without sorrow. Yet this inclination is rather naturall then voluntary, tis rather grounded in their being, then in their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and tis rather a mark of the goodnesse of their Nature, then of their good will, If they naturally love God, they hate him freely, though they desire him they detest him, and though their Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be forced, their aversion is voluntary. Thus we see that the wills instinct is not so constantly set upon Good, but that it may be taken off, and experience teacheth us that since the corruption of sin, man is more inclined to vice then vertue. <note n="z" place="margin">Gratia one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri est, ultio in quaestu habetur.

               <p>Tis a great misfortune, to be born in sin, and to have received bad Inclinations, before we knew them, tis a deplorable condition to be the Object of Gods Anger, before we have provoked him, and to be born away to mischief, before we were able to make resistance; but this misfortune is much the greater, when man joys Custom to Nature, when to those bad Inclinations which he inherits from his Parents, he adds many actuall sins, which forms an Imperious Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, which ingageth him in evill.

                  </note> for as S. <hi>Augustine</hi> says, as long as man obeys his evil inclinations, he forms unto himself evil habits, &amp; when he doth not resist evil habits, they throw the soul into a hard necessity, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> bereaves it of the power of conversion. Then is a sinner an unfortunate slave, he draws neer the condition of the damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he finds his hel on Earth, he carries a Devil in his bosom w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth him in sin. This malady is by nature incurable, and if it be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time cured by grace, 'tis by a kinde of miracle. The evil habit which produceth this necessity is somewhat lesse difficult to cure, but the meanes that are to be used are extream difficult. For though the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments be ordeined to destroy sin, and that Baptisme and repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance do break our Irons and set us at Liberty; yet doth not their power extend to evil habits; they take away the blame and reconcile us to God, but they leave this languishing which weakens Nature, and do not Efface those Maligne Impressions which sin hath made in our soul, they leave us our bad <note n="e" place="margin">Tenent pravae consuetudines quem semel <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Years slip away in this Exercise; without much progresse, and to weaken so powerfull Enemies, many combats must be had. The Sacraments which shed so many Graces into our souls, make us not victorious at the first, that very Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which unites us so straightly to the Son of God, as our souls seem thereby to be mixed together with his, doth not overthrow bad habits: as long as we carry them in our bosomes, we have desires of revenge, and ambitious thoughts, the presence thereof which cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth away Devils, doth not chase away our irregular inclinations; these Monsters give not place to Divine Power, and our will is divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded between the motions of Grace, and those of concupiscence, it is troubled that since it carries about with it its Saviour, it is not yet at liberty; It wonders that whil'st it conceives humble thoughts, it hath yet sometouches of pride, that having no more sin, it yet resents the Effects thereof; that being one of Jesus Christs Subjects, tis yet under the slavery of the Devil, and that tasting the pleasures of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise, it feels notwithstanding the punishment of Hell: these dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders

do subsist with charity, and much time must be had to drive them away, many tears must be shed, many sighs made, and as many good deeds must be done to destroy them, as evil deeds have been done in the forming of them; but to the end that we may the better know the Nature of so dreadfull an Enemy, we must consider him in his birth, and see by what cunning means he insinuates himself into the will.</p>
               <p>Habit and custome are of the same Nature: that which the one doth in estates, the other doth in souls, their wiles are alike, and as they are established by cunning, they are preserved by violence, their <note n="f" place="margin">Gravissimum est Imperium consuetudinis <hi>Senec. in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb.</hi>

There is nothing more pleasing at first sight; they are so plyant as they suit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves toall our desires; they are so shamefac't as they play least in sight: they seek pretences to make their designs be approved of, and in all their undertakings they lean either upon reason or example: they flatter their enemies that they may undo them, and hiding their malice under an appearing mildnesse, they are in a posture of defence before any one thinks to set upon them: but when they are once esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blisht, <note n="g" place="margin">Dismit esse remedio Iocus, ubi quae suerant vitia, mores sunt. <hi>Senec.

               <p>But that which is more deplorable in this condition is, that man who is possest with an ill Habit, is no longer capable of deliberation in his Actions: he follows the Tyrant that inslaves him, he thinks he is bound to defend him, because he hath assisted to set him up; he believes he enjoys Liberty, because he loves servitude; and not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering the evils which threaten him, he with contentment suffers himself to be guided by his Enemy: when he is surprized by any Action, <note n="i" place="margin">In repentinis agimus ex babi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu. <hi>Aristoteles.</hi>

his reason, and he is as it were compel'd to obey him, hence it is that Lascivious men meeting with an unexpected death, think more on their loves than on their souls health, hence it is that Libertines in any eniment danger are apter to swear and curse, than to pray; hence it is that revengefull men, when they fall into any danger, think ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther how to revenge themselves, than how to pardon. For the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant which possesseth them is alwaies in action: he is in the will, as in his throne; from thence he gives out his orders to all the faculties of the soul, and parts of the body; the understanding conceiveth onely such thoughts as are pleasing to him, the memory is onely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed about such species as he forms there, The imagination is full onely of such Phantasmes, as he doth there imprint, the senses act not but by his guidance, and the whole man is so under his power, as he undertakes nothing but by his motions. This unfortunate condision is more common then men think, for all unbeleevers are reduced into it, and wanting true vertues wherewithall to resist the evil inclinations of nature, those inclinations must needs be changed into bad habits; the greatest part of Christians are herein likewise ingaged, for not making good use of grace to suppresse the disorders of concupiscence: they finde themselves as subjected to their wicked customes, and are no longer able to defend themselves against these domestick <note n="k" place="margin">Diffi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Tis not in fine in the Number of our Followers that our Felicity consists, since God lived without Subjects before he made the world, and that of as many happy spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits that do wait upon him, there was not any one neer him before the Creation of the Universe.

               <p>Yet for all the care they have had to disguise Vertues defects, they may be discovered, if attentively considered: for Philosophers who have defined her, have placed her in a certain <note n="u" place="margin">Est virtus habitus animi judicio suscep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, in medio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critate positus, sic que defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus ut pruden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia praescrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serit. <hi>Aristot. lib. 1 Ethic. c.</hi> 6.</note> Mediocrity, which takes from her the Liberty of operating, she is environed by two Enemies which will not suffer her to enlarge her self; if she will exalt her self, she fals into a precepice, and if she endevour to do somewhat towards the acquiring of Glory; Humane weaknesse which cannot suffer it, doth condemn it as a sin. This languishing vertue is shackled, and dares undertake nothing of generous, least starting from out the Common road, she be accused of straying: she is inforced to follow the ordinary Track, and to submit her self to the rules which are prescribed unto her, if she will preserve her reputation: Liberality can do nothing of profuse wherein she may not be accused of prodigality. <note n="x" place="margin">Simplicitas <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Thus Princes can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make use of Liberality; and though the Heavens have given them so great Territory, they must temper Avarice by Prodigality to acquire the title of Liberall.</p>
               <p>Valour is under the same constraint, this generous vertue receives dayly a hundred advises, which under pretence of her preservation, have a design to put a period to her conquests; if she expose her self
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:61993:75"/>
to danger, she is esteemed rash; if relying upon her good fortune, she put on such resolutions as fear approves not off, she is accused of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudencie; yet should she beleeve her advice, she should never do any thing of generous: and had <hi>Caesars</hi> and <hi>Alexanders</hi> valour been limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed within the bounds of fear, they had never fought, nor been vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious; upon some occasions wisdom must give way to fortune, and Conquerours must rather consult with their good fortune than with their duties, The most glorious vertues ought to be free, they are too couragious to live inthrald, they are but the most Common ones that Subject themselves to these Lawes, they must dispense with ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry rules, if they will attempt any thing worthy of memory. Poets knew this very well; for they have been enforced to invent heroick vertues, and to indue their Heroes with a valour, which raised it self above wisdom, and which in the greatest perils advised only with courage, <note n="y" place="margin">Sicut heroes natura homines superabant ita virtute, erant enim inter ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines &amp; Deos medii, corumque virtutes modum communem ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedebant. <hi>Arist.</hi>

Virgins who by their age and sex ought to be timorous, have sought out Tyrants, and provoked their Executioners: they thought it was a kinde of slacknesse to waite for wilde beasts; they irritated their fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, they desired to loose their lives for the glory of Jesus Christ, who inspired them with a sanctified rashnesse; the love which we are bound to bear unto our Enemies, doth much exceed the rules of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, <note n="z" place="margin">Amicos dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gere omnium est, inimicos au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem solor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="118" facs="tcp:61993:76"/>
she endeavours to heighten her desert by Labour; she decks her self with thornes in stead of flowers, covers her self with dust, in stead of sweet powders, drops sweat and bloud, in stead of perfumes, and promiseth such as court her, nothing but disasters and ill luck; she is lodged upon a hill which is smooth, slippery, and steep on all sides, where a man cannot come at her without danger of falling into a precipice; though she promise honour to such as love her, she suffers them oft times to be confounded, and judgeth onely of their love, by misprising glory or pleasure. Shee invites them by her discourse, but endues them not with strength; she perswades their understandings, but doth not raise up their wills: and like the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> she may well have some light, but no heat: <note n="a" place="margin">Infidelium virtus idolum est cujus species jucunda quidem sed virtus ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis.</note> This is the cause why her pertakers have faln into despair, and after having a long time served this rigorous Mistris, they have been forced to accuse her of ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and to blame her cruelty; but what could they hope for from an idol, which being the workmanship of their mindes, had no other perfections than what it had borrowed from their praises, which was onely vigorous in their writings, only beautiful in their Panegy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks, and which was not generous, save in their actions.

               <p>We may truly affirm there have been two sorts of idolaters in the world; the one worshipped the workmanship of their own hands, <note n="b" place="margin">Sicut Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes manibus ita Haeretici &amp; Philosophi ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis, idola fabri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantur. <hi>Tertul. advers.

                  </note> and by an Immense folly put their hope in images which they themselves were Authors off; though they cannot understand them, they serve them with respect, though they cannot defend them, they fly to them for protection; and dread their anger. The other adore the workmanship of their minds, and form unto themselves Noble <hi>Ideas</hi> which they fall in love with, the more beautifull the idols were, the greater impression did they make upon their wils, and the more eloquent they were in describing them, the more superstitious were they in honouring of them. This errour blinded all Philosophers vertue, which is but a habit which we acquire that we may do Good, was the only Divinity which these hood winckt people worshipped; and not considering that there is nothing in the soul of man, which
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:61993:76"/>
merits a Supreme Honour, they bore respect to the good inclinations thereof, when they were governed by the rules of morality; this su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition cost the Apostles, much more pain, than the superstition of the people, they had more ado to convert Philosophers, than Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants; and experience taught them that reason was more opinionated than force. Two ages were sufficient to overthrow all idols of brasse and marble, and though their adorers used cruelty to defend them; martyrs through their patience triumphed over them. But all the Reign of Jesus Christ hath not sufficed to destroy the idols of the minde. The Doctors of the Church have in their writings set upon them, but have not been able to bear them <note n="c" place="margin">Idolatria ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die extra tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plum, &amp; sine idolo agi potest. <hi>Tertul. de Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lolat.</hi>
                  </note> down; and there be yet some libertines, amongst the Children of the Church, that do adore them. They are not so much attracted by the grace of the Son of God, as by the vertue of the <hi>Pagans;</hi> good Nature appears more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable to them than godlinesse, and they more esteem <hi>Seneca's</hi> or <hi>Aristotles</hi> morals, than those of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> or of Saint <hi>Austine</hi> his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciple; yet the Vertue which these Philosophers taught in their Schooles had her esteem heightened onely by reason of her difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and was admired by her partakers onely through a vain beauty which did dazle them. But Christian vertue is at once both beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full &amp; easie, you need but love her to acquire her; to possess her cost us nothing but desires; and the Holy Ghost who sheds her in our souls, endues us with strength to overcome the difficulties which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company her; therefore is it that vertue in Christians did oft times fore-run reason; they were wise before the years of wisdom, and the Agnesses who had Jesus Christ onely for their Master, were vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous before rationall Grace fupplyed their weaknesse, torments exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their courage they were constant, not having read the death of <hi>Socrates,</hi> the life of their spouse made up all their morality, and his maximes confirmed by his examples inspired them with more of Constancie, than was requisit to triumph over the cruelty of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, and to confound the vertue of Philosophers.</p>
               <p>But truly I do not wonder that the vertue of <hi>Pagans</hi> was so weak; since they were divided, and that reason which did guide them could never reconcile them; for though they be said to have one &amp; the same father, and that they are so straitely united together that a man cannot possesse one of them, without possessing all the rest, yet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, teacheth us that they have differences which Philosophy
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:61993:77"/>
hath not yet been able to terminate. Though they conspire together to make a man happy, they trouble his quiet by their division, and make so cruel war one upon another, as to have peace in his soul, he is obliged to drive out one of the parties from thence, Mercy, and Justice cannot lodge together in one Heart, their Interests are so dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent as they are not to be accorded. A man must renounce mildnes if he will be severe, and severity if he will be mercifull. Morality hath not yet found out a secret to reconcile these two vertues, nor to unite them together thereby to make an accomplish't Prince. Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and simplicity hold no better intelligence, the one is always diffident that she may be secure, she oft-times hastens her misfortune, whilest she thinks to avoide it; she had rather do ill, than suffer ill; and her humour is so given to guile, as the best part of her being is made up of dissimulations; simplicity walks in a clean other track, for she findes her assurance in her goodnesse: she fears no outrage, because she beleeves no injustice, she had rather be unfortunate than blamefull, and she is of so good an inclination, as she resolves rather to receive an injury than to do one. If wisdom be not upon good termes with simplicity, she is not upon much better terms with valour: Nature must do a miracle to make them both meete in one Subject; they require different tempers, and the aversion is such, as morality cannot accord them: wise and cautious men are always fearfull, and valiant men are alwayes rash; wisdom is of a cold con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, and doth not ingage her self in any perill till she see a wicket whereby to get out. Valour is hot and firie, considers not danger so much as glory; the one of these startles at all things, the other won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders at nothing; the one and the other of them hath their advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and their defaults, but there is so great an opposition between them, as one and the same man cannot Possesse them both. Thus perfection is an <hi>Idea,</hi> which a man may easily conceive, but never ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire. Morality is an Art which hath more of light than of force, and which very well knows the desert of vertues, but cannot ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pease their differences.</p>
               <p>'Tis mans advantage that the vices cannot be reconciled, that these monsters, who have the same designe, cannot make the same Army, and that Nature to weaken them, hath divided them; to say truth profusion and avarice cannot lodge together in the same breast, and though the one of them proceed from the other, they wage war one
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:61993:77"/>
upon another which ends onely in death. Audacity and Cowardise are incompatible, and though Fortitude be their Common enemy, they cannot joyn together to charge upon it.

               <p>TIs a strange yet a true thing that the pride of Man was twin in birth to his misery, and that he began to be proud assoon as he was miserable. Amidst his greatnesse he was humble, whilest he commanded over all Creatures he obeyed God, and his Empier was grounded upon his submission; <note n="a" place="margin">Hinc enim delectavit quod dictum est eritis sicut Dii, quod melius esse pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent summo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roqut principio cobaerendo per obedientiam, non suum sibi existendo prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipium per su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perbiam.

To effect this his design, he tryed many meanes as unjust, as shamefull: for through a high piece of folly he would shake off the yoke of obedience, which he owed to God; live in a sinfull Liberty, and follow no Laws, but those of his will. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving laid the first ground work of his Rebellion, he endeavored to frame it into a Tyranny, and having shaken off his Sovereign he strove to get Subjects. He used Art to make himself be beloved, and violence to cause himself to be feared, he made his equals his slaves, under pretence of preserving or defending them; he opprest their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and turned his false protection, into a true Tyranny; hence did proceed the first usurpations, which getting authority in process of time, became at last legitimate: for pride was the originall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and the desire of government took away the equality, which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture had placed amongst men.

by this principle had onely a deceitfull appearance of vertue. Vain Glory was the soul of all their designes; did they defend their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, did they conduct their Subjects, did they fight their Enemies? 'twas rather out of the love of Glory, than of Justice. Let them be as carefull as they pleased to hide their intentions, they were always clearly discerned by their actions or their words; their thoughts might be discovered without Tortures, and whilst the name of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice was in their mouthes, nothing but vain glory was observed to be in their hearts; they did publiquely affirm, that to make a kingdom happy, <note n="c" place="margin">Florent civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates si Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phi imperant aut Imperatores philosophantur. <hi>Jul.

               <p>This truth appeared in the greatest part of Monarchies, but shone the clearest in the Roman Common-wealth; and we may affirm, the more she affected vertue, the more was she Subject to vain Glory; <note n="d" place="margin">Haec sunt duo illa libertas &amp; cupiditas laudis humanae quae ad facta com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulere miranda Romanos. <hi>Aug. lib. 5. de Civit. c.</hi> 12.</note> for those who shall examine her proceedings may observe, that all her most Glorious Actions had no other motive, than a desire of preserving her liberty, of acquiring Glory, or of increasing her au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. When <hi>Romulus</hi> his valour <hi>Numa's</hi> Piety, and <hi>Tullies</hi> wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, had Founded the Roman Common wealth, she thought not so much upon extending her limits, as in defending them, she never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared war against her Enemies, but when she saw her self in danger of being opprest.

When all <hi>Italy</hi> was under their Laws, when those who would not be their friends, were become their Subiects, they suffered themselves to be tickled with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of Glory; and those who had no other thought but to be free, began to covet Fame and Glory.

               <p>VErtue is so beautifull as her very shaddow is delightfull; vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces have some sort of comelinesse when they borrow her accoutrements, and we cannot forbear praising such errours, as appear in her likely-hood, We approve of prodigality in Princes, because it counterfeits liberality; We admire boldnesse in Souldiers because it hath an air of valour and courage: We adore ambition in conquerours, because it borders upon Generosity. This errour would be excusable did it not advance further; but there are some men who preferring appearances before truths; value a glorious vice at a higher rate, than a neglected vertue. <hi>Socrates</hi> his conference with his friends seems of a more lofty style to them than doth S. <hi>Pauls</hi> last words, and this Philosophers discoveries prevailes more with them, than the examples of our Martyrs. Hence it is that Christians admire the vertues of Infidels that not content to make their Apologies, they make Panegyricks in their behalf, and praise men on earth whom God punisheth in hell.

               <p>To understand this, we must know that wisdom and power are but one and the same thing in God, that which deliberates, is that w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> resolves, and that which undertakes, is that which puts in execution. If from Divine perfections we passe to the Divine persons we shall finde that the Son, who is the wisdom of his Father, is likewise his power, that he who is his thought, is also his strength; he doth fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cast designes, and finisheth them, he forms enterprizes, &amp; executes them, he is that Pallace proceeding from <hi>Iupiters</hi> brain, which past for the Goddess both of sciences and arms, &amp; which was no lesse recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable for her valour, then for her wisdom: hence it is that he is called by severall names in the holy Scripture, and that he is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time called the <note n="a" place="margin">Verbum Dei &amp; brachium Dei filius passim appellatur in Scripturis.</note> word sometimes the arm of his Father. But in man these qualities are divided, he who is wise is not always strong, and when he hath wisely resolved, he must borrow aide from some other vertue, to execute his resolution with courage. Wisdom is ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous, because cold; valour bold, because hot, and as their quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties require severall tempers, they do not oft times meet in one and the same person: but say Nature should work a miracle by agreeing them, and that a man should have as much courage as conduct, his power would never equall his <note n="b" place="margin">Prudentia plerumque in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Though they had his continencie in great esteem, they did think it was not proof good enough against so exquisite a beauty; and they could not imagine that a man who was yet in the prime of his youth, should have power to withstand the Allurements of so fair a Maide, who had nothing but her tears to defend her self withall.

Justice is reverenced even by her persecutours; Tyrants are affraid of her shadow, and after having bootlesly imployed violence for their defence, they have been fain to have recourse to Justice for their preservation: wisdome is adored by all Politicians, a man must have lost his wits not to value her, if she be not esteemed by fools, she is admired by wisemen; all sorts of people confesse that she is as necessary for the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of private Houses, as of States. All parts of Morality take her for their Guide; and without the assistance of this Vertue, they can neither make an honest man, a States-man, nor a Father of a Family. Temperance is beloved by all men, her Enemies respect her, in those that love her, they confesse that pleasures can neither be innocent, nor yet delightfull, when she is absent; and that pleasure without temperance is the punishment of the unchast. But certainly all the Vertues hide their heads, when Fortitude displayes it's beauties. These Stars are eclipsed, when the other Sun ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears; and people cease from looking upon Justice in Princes, pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in Politicians, and Temperance in Philosophers, when they consider the courage of the unfortunately Innocent.</p>
               <p>Though this Illustrious Vertue be sincere, and that the pain wherewith she is assailed make her unquiet, yet hath she allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which win her more admirers than the other have lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers: There are but few that look after her, but all admire her, and that because persecution must precede courage, every one is content to reverence a vertue, which must cost so dear to come by; she in-nobles such as possesse her, she comforts the condition of

               <p>If the earth produce nothing which may make God stay to look upon it, and if generous actions merit not that God should busie himselfe about them, yet must we confesse that they are approved of by all people; and that men do more admire a Philosopher who suffers death patiently, than a Monarch who governs his State with Justice.

Thus did <hi>Scevola</hi> defie <hi>Tarquin</hi> the proud, his whole hand mist him, and his burning hand struck him with astonishment: hee escaped the Princes anger by preventing it, he pierc't his heart, whose body he could not hurt; and <hi>Tarquin</hi> judging of the Fortitude of all <hi>Romans,</hi> by that of <hi>Scevola,</hi> he feared to have those men for his Enemies, who fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not the fire.

               <p>Man began to be unhappy, when once he became criminall, his subjects became his enemies, the Elements declared war against him, and those elements which went to his composure, divided themselves, that they might alter his temper, and shorten his life: Pain and pleasure agreed together for his undoing, life and death were reconciled to make him suffer. Morall Philosophy, found out vertues to succour him, and every one of these faithfull Allies un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook to defeat an Enemy: wisdome undertook to prevent far distant mischiefes, and by her addresse to avoid them: Justice looks upon her to end al the differences which self-love; and Interest should breed amongst men.

All these vertues were siezed on by astonishment: when they saw so many Monsters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire mans ruine, wisdome confessed, she wanted addresse to molli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie them: Justice profest, she had not sufficient Authority to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse them; and Temperance protested; she wanted vigour to restrain them: Onely Fortitude promised to withstand them:

Fortitude, thus assisted, ingaged her selfe upon all occasions; she received as many blows as she gave, she mingled her bloud with the bloud of her enemies; she past all her life in this exercise, &amp; if she took any ease after a fight, 'twas onely to prepare her self against those that were to ensue. By all this discourse, 'tis easily seen, that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes of Fortitude are much greater than those of all the other ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, &amp; that it is not without reason that they yield the Honour to her, since they dare not appear upon such occasions of Combates as she doth, and bears away the victory.</p>
               <p>Though Fortitude be thus beautifull in <hi>Idea,</hi> yet is she but weake amongst the <hi>Pagans,</hi> and covers true blemishes under deceitfull ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances; for as in them <note n="n" place="margin">Sine dono Dei nec virtutes pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sunt appeti vel haberi, nec ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum similitudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes quae sunt vitia virtu'es imitantia devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tari. <hi>August. lib. 3. de vita conte up l. c.</hi> 1.</note> she cannot have charity, for her originall, she derives oft-times from self-love, and inherits all her Fathers weaknesses; it is her own Glory she must seek, since she is ignorant of Gods Glory; it is anger which must give her heat, revenge which must provoke her, and vain glory, which must in-animate her, since 'tis not Faith that doth assist her. All these passions mixt together, make up the greatest part of her greatnesse; and when one shall examine her intentions, or motives, he shall finde that her noblest exploits, are but magnificall sins.

In fine; no reason can justifie despair: the number of our enemies, the evils of the present life, the Good of the Future, the cruelty of sicknesses, rigour of servitude, sweetnesse of liberty, strength of Temptations, nor the very fear of sin, are not considerations sufficient to make us hasten our death; 'tis alwaies poornesse of <note n="x" place="margin">De <hi>Catonis</hi> facto quid po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisstmum di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cam, nisi quod amici ejus etiam docti quidam viri qui hoc fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri prudentius dissuadebant, imbecillior is quam for tioris animi esse cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suerunt. <hi>Aug. li. 1. de civit. c.</hi> 23</note> spirit, not to be able to suffer the evil which we will shun by Homicide, Pride hath lesse part in this crime then weaknesse, and whatsoever praise the despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate man expects for his attempt, wise men will alwaies beleeve, that if he had courage enough to bear the miseries of life, he would never have had recourse to so cowardly a remedy.

               <p>IF the vertue of <hi>Pagans</hi> have her stains, we must not wonder if their Friendship have her defaults: sin hath corrupted the best things, and her malice hath left almost nothing in man, <note n="y" place="margin">Omnibus ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caes est qui sibi, sed solum sibi qui Deo est.</note> which doth not deserve reproach or punishment: since a sinner is upon bad termes with God, he cannot be upon good terms with himself, nor with his Neighbour.

For though brothers proceed from the same stem, they are not alwayes of the same Humour; they differ often more in their Inclinations, then in their Countenances: but say there were any thing of resemblance in their humours, the dividing of Estates divides hearts; and Interest, (which hath to do every where) doth many times ruine their best intelligence.

Nature leaves us no choise, in her alliances, we are enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged before we be capable of choise; and she oft-times makes us love a Monster, because he is our Brother; but friendship gives us a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of choise, she permits us to take the best, and we are onely to blame our own folly, if in the liberty she leaves us, we make choise of one for a friend, who deserves not our affection. Our Brethren are the workmanship of nature, she did not advise with us, when she gave them life; and not having the care of producing them, we delight not in preserving them. <note n="b" place="margin">Amicitia vinculum nullâ ex parte sang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinis viribus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferius.

               <p>But not to spend more time in observing the advantages which friendship hath over and above nature; we must confesse, there is nothing in the world which ought not to give place to friendship: Law, which preserves Estates, which punisheth vice, defends ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, is not equall to her, neither for antiquity, nor power.

The Law ends differences, but friendship reconciles enemies; the law inhibits injuries, but friendship adviseth good offices. In fine, the law is requifite to the commencement or initiation of a good man, but friendship is required to his accomplishment; and by her advice renders him perfect.</p>
               <p>She is also of use to all sorts of Conditions, and that man liues not, that needs not a friend. A friend is needfull to old men, to assist them, to young men, to guide them; to the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable, to comfort them, to the ignorant, to instruct them; and to

For though their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion seem to be raised above that of all other men, and that amidst the abundance of riches, and honours, wherewith they are enviro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, there remains nothing for them to wish for, yet ought they to make friends, and endeavour a delight, which agrees as well with Greatnesse, as with Innocence. Friendship is the best of all exteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Goods, and 'twere unjust that Kings who possesse whatsoever else is of good, should not possesse this; Friendship obligeth us ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to give, than to receive; <note n="d" place="margin">Etiam beat us devet am' cos habere I, quia bonorum exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norum maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum amicitia, deinde ami<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

In fine, happy Princes ought not to be solitary, and I know not whether any one of them would accept of their felicity, at the rate of living solitarily: Therefore greatnesse doth not forbid friendship to Soveraignes, that which seems to keep them aloofe off from this vertue, draws them nearer to it; and their power is never more pleasing, than when imployed in succouring the miserable, or in making men happy.

               <p>Though these reasons do mightily inhance the merit of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, yet must we conclude in Saint <hi>Austines</hi> Principles.

He who prefers the pleasures of the body, before those of the mind, who hazards his honour to preserve his riches, and who injures his conscience, to encrease his reputation, cannot be a good friend to others, because he is his own Enemy; and who wants vertue, cannot have friendship. Morall Philosophy with all her precepts, cannot reforme a disorder, which since the losse of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall righteousnesse, makes up one part of our selves: the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousnesse thereof hath past into our nature, and as we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not without grace be upon good termes with our selfe, neither can we without her be upon good termes with others. We ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther give them too much, or not enough; we cannot keep that just measure, which makes friendship reasonable, we turne a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue into a passion; or to speak trulier, we make an innocent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction criminall; and the same selfe-love which puts us on ill termes with our selves, puts us upon the like with our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; we love his errours, whil'st we think to love his perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; we excuse his sins, in stead of condemning them, and we oft-times become guilty of his faults, for having approved them. <hi>Blosius</hi> confesseth he would have burnt <note n="g" place="margin">

It may be 'twas for this cause, that <hi>Aristotle</hi> blaming friendship, whil'st he thought to praise her, said, that her perfection consisted in her excesse; and that far dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering from common vertues, which do consist in mediocrity; she was never more admirable, than when most excessive: That a man might give too much, but not love too much; that one might have too much courage, but not too much love; that a man might be too wise, but not too loving; yet this excesse is vitious, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience teacheth us, that Common-wealths have no more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Enemies, than those who are ready to do or suffer any thing for their friends.

               <p>But we must not wonder if friendship be faulty amongst the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans,</hi> since she is not alwayes innocent amongst Christians, and since interest, which gives against the designes of Charity, keeps her from inlarging her self, and doth unjustly confine her self between two parties; for we suffer our selves to be perswaded by Philosophy, that common friendship cannot be reall, that he who loves many, loves none, and that who doth so readily ingage himself, doth disingage himself with as much as Ease. Yet the Son of God bindes us to love all Christians as our brothers, he will have his body and blood, to be the bond of all the faithfull, and that his chiefest <note n="p" place="margin">Vnus est Pater vester vos au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem omnes fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tres estis. <hi>Matth. c.</hi> 23.</note> mysteries tend onely to the uniting of them together: his pleasure was, that we should all have one and the same Father, to the end, we might have one and the same inheritance; he ordeined but one Baptisme, to the end, that our birth might be alike; and that the difference of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions being banisht from out his Church; reciprocall love might not by mistake be diminished; he gave us but one head, to the end, we might be inanimated by the same spirit, and that the conformity of our opinions might be the preservation of our friendship: he hath <note n="q" place="margin">Omnes uno pane participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus. <hi>Apostolus Paul.</hi>

love derides them, the division of wealth divides their wills; every one prefers his interest before Charity; the Common people end their differences by suite at Law, Gentle-men by Duels, and Princes by Battails; <note n="r" place="margin">Cum sit inter vos zelus &amp; contentio nonne carnales estis, &amp; secundum hominem am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulatis. 1. <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth.</hi> 3.</note> Men defend their right either by cunning, or by force; not considering that Jesus Christ lives in our enemies, we kill them to revenge our selves, and commit murther, to cancell an injury.</p>
               <p>But though we should be more charitable, we cannot shun being unfortunate; for sin hath so corrupted our nature, &amp; Divine Justice hath so severely punisht sins, as the life of man is rather a succession of miseries, then of years: man cannot live long without much suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, if his body be in health, his minde is sick, if his wealth be not exposed to injustice, his Innocency is exposed to Calumny: if he fence himself from one misfortune, he is assayed by another: and he learns to his own cost, that long life is but a long punishment.

               <p>Therefore do the unfortunate fear having friends, when they are uninteressed, they love not that their maladie should be contagious, it sufficeth them that they are miserable without making others so: they are as covetuous of their Pains, as they have been prodigall of their pleasures; they think not themselves freed of their miseries by laying them upon their friends; they shun company for fear of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting them; knowing that solitarinesse is the abode of the afflicted, they forsake the world, and hold for certain that an unfortunate man

               </argument>
               <p>IT must be confest that man is very unfortunate in becoming guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, since his perfections, and his defects are almost equally fatall to him. <note n="y" place="margin">Natura bonis suis male vti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, &amp; unde se defendi existi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mat accusatur. <hi>Prosp. contra Collator. ca.</hi> 22</note> His vertues are false, and his vices true; his most glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous actions do oft-times derive from so bad an originall, as they are not to be praised without injuring in some sort both grace and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. His ignorance doth not always excuse his sin, and his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge doth not always enhance his vertue. The more he is know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the more guilty is he, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>He withholds the truth in unrighteousnesse;</hi> and his light is intermixt with so much darknesse, that it may lead him out of the way, and cannot conduct him. This is notwithstanding mans most violent passion: desire of knowledge is born with him, and if it makes not his difference, it is one of his chiefest Proprieties. For Beasts are wrought on by ambition, they fight for glory; and as if that were the onely reward of their victory, they pardon their enemies, after they have beaten them: they are tormented with love and jealousie; Lions can endure no rivalls, and if they want rewards to honour fidelity, they want not chastisements to punish Adultery. Desire of life is not much lesse violent in beasts, than in men; the same instinct which animates Tigres to seek out prey for their nourishment, makes Stags hide themselves in woods for their preservation. Nature teacheth them remedies for their evils, and this common mother furnisheth them with herbes to cure them: the apprehension of death encourageth the most timerous; when they are bereft of all hope of safety, they turn their fear to fury; and to shun danger, throw themselves head-long into it. But the desire of knowledge is peculiar to man, and there is no cruelty, which he useth not to content his curiosity. He rips open the bowels of the earth, to know the secrets thereof; he melts metals, to discover their essences; he descends to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of the Sea, to learn the wonders thereof; he turns the world

This pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion is much augmented by the esteem which it hath won in the world; for nothing is more honoured than knowledge: the Devil gave it credit in the earthly Paradise, &amp; by the praises which he gave it, made our first Parents long after it: their children imitated them in their errour, &amp; consecrated their watchings to the atchieving of so rich a fleece. Greatest honours have been conferr'd upon the most know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men; and if those which have freed their Countrey from the Insolence of Tyrants, have past for <hi>Heroes,</hi> those who have found out Arts, &amp; who have defended men either from ignorance, or from necessity, have had Temples and Altars erected to them; in so much as the Devill kept his word, which his gave our first Parents; when <note n="a" place="margin">Eritis sicut Dii scientes bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num &amp; malum, <hi>Gen. cap.</hi> 3.</note> to seduce them, he would perswade them their knowledge would make them Gods: and his promise, though false, hath been in some sort accomplisht by peoples simplicity, who have adored knowing men.

The Grecian <hi>Achilles,</hi> and <hi>Hector</hi> of <hi>Troy,</hi> never won so much renown by their valour, as by his praises. This onely example makes it evident, that Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge hath the upper-hand of Courage, and that the labours of the brain are more durable than the Conquests of Kings; yet hath knowledge her defaults, since the state of sin, and there is no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge so certain, which admits not of doubts; none so profitable, which is not discommodious, nor none so good, which is not bad.</p>
               <p>True knowledge ought to have two qualities; Evidence, and Certainty: <note n="c" place="margin">Philosophorum alii mibi non profuturum scientiam trae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dunt, alii spem omnis scientiae eripiunt, alii non praeferunt lumen per quod acies dirigatur ad verum, alii oculos mihi effo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinnt. <hi>Senec. Epist.</hi> 88.</note> the first without the second occasioneth Opinion, the second without the first, produceth Faith. Therfore 'tis that all Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences boast to possesse these two advantages, and employ all their power to perswade us, that they are evident, and assured; but the means they make use of to prove this, contradicts their design, and makes their doubts and obscurities equally appear. For they draw their light either from Time, Authority, or Experience: Time is the father of truth, but is also oft-times the murtherer thereof, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Rabbines;</hi> 'tis the witnesse of all things, but it suffers corruption; and the depositions thereof are as obscure, as doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: all knowing men complain, that life is short, the way to know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge long; and that it were requisite to spend whole Ages in the School of Time, to become learned. 'Tis only permitted to <hi>Damons,</hi> who are ancient as the world, to profit under a Master, that discovers his secrets only to such, as through their own industry observe them.</p>
               <p>Authority is grounded upon the worth of those who have gone before us: their antiquity gives them credit, we think them abler than our selves, onely because they are older; and we dare nor op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose their opinions, because they are no longer able to defend them; they onely rule, because they live no longer; and if they beare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the victory, 'tis because they are without the danger of the fight.

which destroyes the power of Soveraigns, establisheth the Tyranny of Philosophers, and these men who live no longer, have yet credit enough to triumph over our liberty. Yet is their antiquity a proofe of their ignorance: since they have seen lesse then we, they should in reason know lesse; and since they lived in the first Ages, they could not have made sufficient observations to discern the truth. That which we call the worlds Antiquity, <note n="d" place="margin">Antiquitas mundi suven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus saeculi. <hi>Bac.</hi>
                  </note> was but it's Infancy; men, not being able to advantage themselves by the labour of their Ancestours, did live in profound ignorance, and left the glory of finding out truth, to the care of those that should succeed them.</p>
               <p>Experience is grounded upon the Senses, and hath all her good from their reports: but all men know these Messengers are unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, that they are corrupted by objects, that the soule which is by them advised, is oft-times deceived; and that nature hath given her an inward light, to free her selfe from their Superchery: they mistake themselves daily in their own operations; &amp; if we will believe these blinde guides, we shall be always engaged in errour.

               <p>The uncertainty thereof is accompanied with uselessenesse, and let her promise what she pleaseth, she teacheth us things which are rather curious, than profitable.

Not being able to accord the Elements within our bodies, nor yet the passions in our soules, she busieth her selfe in sorting voices, and in forming an agreeable harmony out of differing Tones; not being able to withstand vices, nor irregular inclinations, she undertakes to fight against wilde-beasts, or ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; to get the victory where the danger exceeds the honour; and to bear away Triumph, where injustice and fortune have a greater share then courage or wisdome. <note place="margin">Doces me quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modo voces con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fonent, fac po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius quomodo animus meus secum consonat.

In effect the most knowing men have not alwayes been the most vertuous; and those who have Written best, are not those that have lived best. <hi>Seneca's</hi> life agrees not with his writings; the counsels which he gives to <hi>Nero</hi> in <hi>Tacitus</hi> are not like those which he gives him in his books of anger, and clemencie; he is much more generous in his epistles to <hi>Lucilius,</hi> then in his consolation to <hi>Polybius:</hi> and his naturall questions taste much more of Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie, then that bloody invective which he wrote after the death of <hi>Claudius:</hi> these two pieces discover his nature, which in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he sought to disguise: when he sets forth vertue to the life, and gives her so many charmes to make her Lovely, me thinks I seek a Black-more painting a fair Woman, or a corrupt Lawyer pleading an Honest cause. <hi>Socrates</hi> and <hi>Plato,</hi> though they were the most learned of their age, were not the most vertuous; their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons require rather Apologies than Panegyricks: if they condemn ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ambition, 'tis to authorize uncleannesse; if they contemn'd the love of Women, 'twas thought 'twas to authorize the like of yong men; and that if quencht impure flames, 'twas to kindle Hellish ones. <hi>Epicurus</hi> and <hi>Zeno</hi> breathed forth nothing but either Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, or vaine glory; if the one wage war with vice, 'tis onely to purchase Glory, and if the other suppresse his Passions, 'tis onely that he may enjoy the more Rest, and that he may adore Pleasure in the temple of vertue.

but fear keeps us from doing so; we know, that we ought to incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modiate our selves, to serve our friends; but pleasures divert us from it: we know, that we should prefer Honour before pleasure, and innocence before both; but ambition and delight will not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit us so to do: so as it is to no purpose to advise us, unlesse the Obstacles which oppose themselves to that advise be removed, and unlesse the will be heated at the same time that the understanding is enlightened.</p>
               <p>But that which is yet more grievous, and which obligeth all men to confesse, that Knowledge is corrupted by sin, is, that she is an enemy to vertue, and that under pretence of defending her, she wageth war against her. The <hi>Roman</hi> Common-wealth did never flourish more then in the <note n="l" place="margin">Melius suisset non didicisse scientiam, post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam docti pro dierunt, boni esse desierunt.</note> first Ages, wherein she was content to know, that she was to honour her Gods, guide her People, assist her Allyes, and to fight her enemies: she lost her integrity when she would increase her knowledge: Pleasures en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred <hi>Rome,</hi> together with forreign sciences, and from the time that once the <hi>Romans</hi> began to dispute concerning vertue, they cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to practise her: the <hi>Greeks</hi> revenged themselves on them by their Philosophers; not being able to overcome them by Arms, they found a meanes how to corrupt them by their conferences; and giving them Learning, they bereft them of Justice, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they had won so much over all the people of the world. <hi>Athens</hi> was more learned than <hi>Lacedaemon,</hi> but <hi>Lacedaemon</hi> was more vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous than <hi>Athens;</hi> Vertue triumphed over Eloquence, and this Town which was wholly composed of Philosophers and Orators, was brought to serve the other which abounded in ignorance. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience teacheth, that knowledge doth abate courage; that in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing the understanding, she weakens it; and that in teaching how to speak well, she makes us forget how to do well. The <hi>Turks</hi> owe their valour totally to their ignorance; and if any Innocencie remain amongst the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> 'tis because they have not yet been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the mischeif of knowledge.</p>
               <p>Wisdom her self is not reconciled to her: these two Sisters, which Philosophers boast to have united, cannot agree together in any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary degree.

The most dangerous folly is not Stupid; that which is occasioned by Ignorance, is easily remedied; but that which is oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned through Study, makes both Physician and Patient despaire; in fine, knowledge is the learned mans punishment; she is more boundlesse then ambition, <note n="n" place="margin">Qui addit sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entiam, addit &amp; laborem. <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siast 1. cap.</hi> Dedit hanc pes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simam occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem homini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus. <hi>Ecclesiast. 1. cap.</hi>

A man must become ignorant, to become Faithfull.

               <p>AS Eloquence is the Mistresse of handsome language, as she makes the Panegyricks of Princes, vaunts her self to put a valuation upon vertue, and to reward her for all the glorious troubles she undergoes, so hath she not been wanting in giving unto her self those praises which she thinks are due unto her, and to imploy all her cunning in making her worth appear. For if we will beleeve her, she boasts that no power equals hers, and that without use of fire or sword, she hath the power of perswading the opinioned, of reducing Rebels, and of obliging wicked men to side with vertue. <note n="q" place="margin">An ego falso scripsi cedant armatogae, &amp;c. qui togat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But without listning any longer to her unjust praises, I pretend to make her partakers confesse, that since she became a slave to sin, she injures by one and the same excesse, Truth, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and Religion.</p>
               <p>'Tis hard to say, whether Cunning be the father of Eloquence, or Eloquence be the mother of cunning, but 'tis easily to discerne, that each of them assist other, in the bearing down of truth.

               <p>As all her glory consists in her naked plainnesse, so doth also her strength; the very sight of her is sufficient to make her be beloved; she very well knows, that they that know her cannot oppose her, nor yet defend themselves from her. <note n="u" place="margin">Magna est vis veritatis quae contra omnium ingenia callidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem, soler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam, contra fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctas hominum insidias facile se per seipsam de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendit. <hi>Sen.

               <p>If truth complain of Rhetorick, reason hath as much cause so to do; and who shall consider, what ill offices she hath received from her, will finde, that she should never implore her aid: for though this Sovereign be not always at peace, within her Territories, and that her Subjects do somtimes despise her authority, Eloquence is not sincere enough to re-invest her in her power, and it oft-times falls out, that whil'st she thinks to stifle disorder, she augments it. For Reason hath nothing to fear in her Empire, but the errour of her understanding, the obstinacy of the will, the revolt of passions, and the unfaithfulnesse of the senses; let her prevent these disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and she may be sure to raign peaceably.

               <p>Eloquence boasts, that in this point, she hath great advantage o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Philosophers: the Cadence of her periods smooths the senses; she imitates musick, and makes use of the voice of Oratours, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant the ears; <note n="d" place="margin">Eloquentia est idoncoru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But I finde that all the means which Eloquence attempts, are extreamly dangerous, and that the remedies which she applies, are worse than the malady which she would cure. For thinking to flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the senses, she engageth them in voluptuousnesse; whil'st she would divert them from, she accustometh them to delight; and though her designe be innocent, yet ceaseth it not to produce ill effects. For as oft as a pleasing Oratour defends an ill cause, and that he imployes all his good parts in favour of injustice; the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, which seek onely after content, suffer themselves to be borne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by his cunning; and making interressed reports to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, they engage it in their revolt. Thus is a pleasing fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shood better entertained than truth; and vertue is lesse valued than vice, if she appeare more austere.</p>
               <p>Eloquence is not more fortunate in taming passions, then in charming senses: for though she be acquainted with the secret of kindling and allaying choller, of setting love and hatred on fire, of abusing hope, and sweetning despair, yet hath she this of mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, that as she laies one passion asleep, she awakens another; and be it for want of dexterity, <note n="e" place="margin">Invenit no his malus orator remedia saepe periculis peiara. <hi>Senec.

                  </note> or for her diffidence of her own strength, she never sets upon vengeance, unlesse she be assisted by ambition; she meddles not with love, without exciting hatred, and quels not hope, without raising fear. Thus she hurts us, to cure us; and her remedies are worse than our diseases. She imitates those bad Physicians, who debauch the stomack, to refresh the bowels; and who undo one part, to preserve another; for not weighing the danger, she oft-times awakens cruelty in a Tyrant, to encourage him against an Enemy; she excites ambition in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour, to incline him to clemency; and hazards a whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to save a guilty person. Men blamea Prince, who to revenge himselfe of his Subjects, puts weapons into the Rebels hands, and and who under colour of stifling a commencing sedition, streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens a party, which justles out his Authority; yet this is the order observed by Eloquence in her Orations; and expearience teacheth us, that to overcome a passon which opposeth her designes, she will not fear to awaken another which will entrench upon the publique Liberty. <hi>Cicero</hi> flatters <hi>Cesars</hi> vain glory, to obtain <hi>Marcellus</hi> his pardon, he propounds glory to him, to divert him from rigour: yet <note n="f" place="margin">Cum aff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick truth walks in the midst between these two errours; condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Manichees, she acknowledgeth that mans body is made by God enlivened by his breath, and fastened to the soul by invisible chaines, to make one and the same whole: condemning the <hi>Pelagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> she confesseth that mans body hath lost its innocencie; that sin reigns in the members thereof, that it infecteth the soul which ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimates it, and that the well fare thereof, which begins in Baptisme, will not be accomplisht till the last generall resurrection. Thus God is the Author thereof, and 'tis a marke of 'its <note n="n" place="margin">Deus carnis author, Christus carnis Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptor est. <hi>Tertull</hi> de <hi>resur. c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> Goodnesse; Jesus Christ is the redeemer thereof, and 'tis a mark of it's corruption. I therefore am obliged to part this subject into two discourses, the first of which shall contain the bodyes plea, the other its condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
               <p>Though the body be the least part of man, and that it be Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to him with beasts, yet hath it advantages which make it suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently known, that it is destin'd to be the organ of an immortall soul. For the members thereof are so artificially formed, as we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not judge whether they be more usefull or more pleasing; their number causeth no confusion, their difference augments their beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and their proportion gives the last touch to the work which they all together make up. All of them have their particular employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:61993:109"/>
they mutually assist one another, without intrenching one upon another; they hold such intelligence as their good and bad is common: the tongue serves for interpreter to the whole body, the eyes serve it for a guide, the hands for its servants, the ears for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers, and the leggs for supporters. Some of them are in perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall motion, and never rest, Action is their life, and rest their death: whilest the eyes are lull'd asleep, the ears closed up, and whilest the feet and hands lie fallow, the heart is always in action; it seems that nature intended to make it her chief piece of workmanship, and that she employ'd all her industry to render it admirable.</p>
               <p>'Tis the first part of man that lives, and the last that dies; it is so <note n="o" place="margin">Cor paruum est &amp; magna cupit: vix ad unius milui refectionem sufficere posset &amp; totus mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus ei non suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit. <hi>Hugo. li. 3. de anin. â.</hi>
                  </note> little; as 'twill not suffice to give a Kite a meal; and yet so great, as the whole world cannot satisfie it: nothing but his immensity that made it, can fill the infinite capacity thereof. All passions derive from it, as from their spring-head; 'tis this that causeth love and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred? 'tis this that shuns what it hates for fear, and draws neer to what it loves through desire. 'Tis lodged like a King in the midst of its sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; it gives its orders, without departing from its Throne; its motions are the rules of our health, and assoon as it is assailed, we are sick: its least hurts are mortall: Nature, which knows the worth and the weaknesse thereof, hath endued all its subjects with a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret inclination to expose themselves for its defence, the hands put by the blows that are made at it; and knowing that their welfare consists in the preservation thereof, they hazard themselves to save it from danger. To reward this their service, this Sovereigne is so vigilant, as he never takes rest; he labours alwayes for the weal-publick, and whilest the senses are asleep, he is busied in moving the Arteries, in forming the Spirits, and in distributing them about all the parts of the Body. The Braines finish this work, and giving it its last perfection, dispose it to the noblest operations of the soul. This work ceaseth not, though men sleep; though the Soul take some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshment, these two parts of the Body are always in action; and when they cease to move, they cease to live. All these live in so full a peace, as the difference of their temper is not able to disturbe it: Cold accords there with heat, moystnesse is there no longer an enemy to drynesse; and the elements which cannot tolerate one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other in the World, conspire together in man, for his bodies pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation. If any disorder happen, it is occasioned by forreign heat,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:61993:109"/>
the naturall Subjects never trouble the States tranquility: they are so straightly joyn'd by their Interests, as nothing can befall the one which the other doth not resent; the pain of one part is the sicknesse of the whole body: <note n="p" place="margin">Sipatiatur o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culus omnia do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebunt, omnia <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>If their love be so rare, their obedience is no lesse remarkable; for they force their own inclinations to observe the orders of the will; and their fidelity is so ready, as the command is no sooner impos'd, then obey'd: at their Soveraigns bare motion, the hands strive to be acting, the tongue explains his intentions, the eyes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse his thoughts, and the eares execute his designs. The will findes out so much submission in the faculties of the soule, as in the parts of the body; she is oft-times divided by her desires, and opposed by her own inclinations; sheis a rebell to her selfe, &amp; cannot comprehend how one and the same object can cause horrour and love in her at the same time: but she never commands her body without being obey'd, and unlesse passions make a mutiny in it, or that it be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order'd by sicknesse, it fulfils her orders with as much readinesse, as faithfulnesse.</p>
               <p>She likewise undertakes nothing without the assistance of this faithfull companion, <note n="q" place="margin">Nunquam a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nima sine carne est quamdiu in carne est, nibil non cum illa a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>git sine qua non est. <hi>Tertul. de resur. carn.</hi>

                  </note> she hath no strong agitations which appear not in the eyes, and when she is disquieted by any violent passion, 'tis soon seen in the face. A man must be very vigilant to hinder the commerce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the body and the soule; the rules of discretion, and all art of policy, which re-commends dissimulation to Soveraigns, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not keep their countenances from discovering their designes, nor their eyes from betraying their wills: the soule conceales nothing from this her faithfull confident; he that could well study the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges which appear in the face, might infallibly know the alterations of the minde; and without needing to wish as that ridiculous <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan</hi> did, one might read in the forehead, the hearts most secret thoughts. If <hi>Physiognomie</hi> be a Science, she hath no certainty but
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:61993:110"/>
what she draws from the connexion which nature hath placed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the soule and the body; all her observations are grounded upon the noblest part of the body; if all be true that is said of her, as soon as she sees the face, she knows the humour; and without or Charmes or Magick, she knows their intentions, whose Linea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments she observes. Though I dare not acknowledge all this, and that I have much a do to believe that a Physiognomist can discover the designes of a wise Minister of State, by looking him in the face, and that without racking a malefactour, he may read his fault in his eyes; it sufficeth me to know that this Science is grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the commerce between the soule and the body, and that she draws her conjectures from the straight union that is between them.</p>
               <p>As the Soule doth not forme any designe, wherein the body is not a complice; so doth she taste no contentment, wherein the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy doth not share a part: if <note n="s" place="margin">Quem enim natura usum, quem mundi fructum, quem elementorum sa porem non per carnem anima depascitur? per quam omni in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumento sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suum fult<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

It seems the world was made for the bodies diversion, and that all those pleasing parts which go to the composure thereof, have onely been made to delight the senses; the Sun is of no use to the glorified Spirits, and all the brightnesse of that goodly Constellation cannot light the Angels; those noble Intelligences have a spirituall world wherewith they are possest, and ravisht: they finde their happinesse in God, and all that we wonder at in the world, affords them no delight. <hi>Materia</hi> is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to tasting the pleasures of sensible nature; such contentments presuppose a low condition, and it is common with Beasts to partake of such diversions. 'Tis notwithstanding one of the bodies least advantages, that the world should be made for it's use; and that this chiefe piece of Gods workmanship is destined either for it's service, or it's delight.</p>
               <p>Jesus Christ followed his Fathers steps; and when he came up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth, he would have the body to be the object of his mercy, and of his power; though he laboured for the conversion of sinners, his greatest miracles were wrought for the healing of the sick; and the body being mans weakest part, he thought he was to treat it

               <p>Neither did he neglect it in the institution of the Sacraments; for though they were chiefly ordained for the soules sanctification, and that these admirable Channels poure grace into the soule, yet are they applied upon the body before they produce their effects in the will; and they respect joyntly the two parts which go to mans composure. <note n="u" place="margin">Caro abluitur ut anima ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Having so many obligations to her body, she cannot forget them, nay even in the state of Glory, where all her designes ought to be satisfied, she wisheth to be re-united to her body, as that wherein her intire felicity consisteth. For though she reign with Angels, that she behold the divine Essence, and that she enjoy a happinesse, to which even wishes cannot adde, yet hath hath she a passion for her body, and all the good she doth possesse cannot take from her the desire, nor memory thereof; though she hath
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:61993:111"/>
made triall of it's revolts; though this friendly enemy hath oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times persecuted her, and that she hath desired death to be freed from the Tyranny thereof, yet doth she languish after it, and contrary to their humour who have recovered liberty, yet she longs for that which did engage her in servitude. Though the body be reduced to dust, though it cause pity in it's Enemies, and though it cause hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour in those to whom it was so lovely, she forbeares not to desire it, and to expect the resurrection with Impatience, that her body may partake of the blisse which she enjoyes.</p>
               <p>And 'tis not without much justice that she beares so much love to her body, since she owes the greatest part of her advantages un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, and that she hath hardly any vertue, or light, which she hath not acquired by the assistance of the senses. The soule is ignorant when first infused into the body; the knowledge which the Plato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists attribute unto her, is but a meer capacity of apprehending. If she will be intrusted, she must be advised either by her eyes, or by her eares, she must consult with these Masters, if she will free her selfe from ignorance. How noble soever she be by birth, <note n="y" place="margin">Artes per car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem, studia in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genii per car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem, atque adeo totum vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere animae car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis est, ut non vivere animae nil aliud sit, quàm à carne divertere. <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tull. de resurr. carn. cap.</hi> 6.</note> she hath but weak conjectures of truth, if these faithfull officers should faile her; and should she be ingaged in a body which should have no use of senses, she would be plunged in eternall darknesse.

               <p>As the soule receives these advantages by the body, so doth she distribute them by the bodies assistance, and doth not expresse her thoughts but by the mouth of her Interpreter: she gives with the tongue, what she hath received by the eare; and as she is rich onely by means of the senses, so is she by them onely liberall. She ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves the different qualities of objects by the eyes, she judgeth of the diversity of sounds by the eares; she comprehends mens in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions by their discourse, <note n="z" place="margin">Sermo de or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gano carnis est. <hi>Tertul. de re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sur. carnis ibid.</hi>

If we will give ear to the Peripateticks, who come neerest the truth, tis the least part of Man, which being given him to serve the soul, crosseth all her designs, and hinders the execution of her no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blest enterprises. Hence it is, that all Philosophers do what in them lieth, to have no commerce with the body, and wish for death or old age, to the end that the one may weaken this Domestick enemy, and that the other may free them from it.</p>
               <p>Christian Religion, which marcheth in the midst of errours with assurance, confesseth, that the body is as well the workmanship of God as the soul is, and though it be not altogether so noble, it cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth not to be destined to the same happinesse. But as slaves are pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisht for their masters, and as children sometimes bear the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their fathers sins, the body hath been punisht for the soul, and from the time it became confederate in her crime, it partook in her punishment. Though the soul be the more guilty, the body is the more unfortunate; and of the two parts which go to the compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of man, the most innocent seems to be the most miserable.

These punishments are so irksome as each of them deserves a discourse; and not to enter upon a subject which I should handle more at large, it shall suffice me for the present to make it manifest, that though the body be the Souls slave, since sin it is become her Tyrant, and that it neither tastes of contentment, nor suffers sorrow wherein it shares not with her.</p>

The Rebell Angels never fought to divide the riches of the earth, the division of Provinces, or Kingdoms, did never move ambition in them, the beauty of women never caused in them loose desires, nor did ever any of those sins which arise from flesh &amp; bloud, tempt those haughty spirits. The greatest part of our excesse derives from the body; if we were parted from it, we should either become innocent; or if in that condition we should have either ambition, or avarice, their motive and object would be altered. The greatest Conquerours have no motions which are not common to them with Lions; Lovers jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie is not more noble then is that of Buls; and the husbandry of the Avaritious is not more just then is that of Owles, and Ants: if men be more to blame then beasts, 'tis because their soule com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies with their bodies, and that she makes use of her advantages, to supply her slaves necessities. But the mischiefe takes it's originall from the body; and as the woman tempted man after she had been seduced by the devill, the flesh tempts the spirit after having been sollicited by objects which flatter the senses.</p>
               <p>I very well know that in the State of Innocency, the soule was first guilty, and that the body being subject to reason could not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite the first seditions; it was obedient to it's Sovereign, and as long as the soule was subject to God, the body was subject to the soule; but when once the soule rebell'd against her God, her body scorn'd to be commanded by her. And as mans fault had been a revolt, his punishment was a rebellion also. All our mischief ariseth from the bad intelligence which is held between the two parts, whereof we are composed; he who could appease their differences,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:61993:114"/>
might remedy our sins; and if the body did no longer rebell against the soule, we should have reason to hope, that the soule would no longer rebell against God.</p>

But the disorder which we see in mans Temperature, the opposition of those Elements which go to his composure, and that generall revolt which hath shed it self through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all his members, obligeth us to detest sin, which is the cause
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:61993:115"/>
thereof. We must argue in the same sort concerning our senses, and confesse, that as their use deserves estimation, their irregularity de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves blame.</p>
               <p>They are admirable in their structure, and were they not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to us with beasts, we might be permitted to glory in them. The operation of the noblest of them is so subtill, as that the soule, as divine as she is, can hardly comprehend it; she admireth these Master-pieces of nature, though she have so great a share in their miracles, yet knows she not how they are done; and thinks strange that she should contribute to wonders which she cannot conceive. For the soule inanimates the senses, and this spirituall forme, is a created Divinity which sees by the eyes, heares by the eares, and expresseth it selfe by the mouth. But if the senses have their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, they have also their defects; and if the soule receive any service by them, she is by them likewise much injured. They are the gates of falshood and errour, vanity slides into our soules, by their means; they are exposed to illusions; the objects wherewith they are pleased corrupt them; and being once corrupted by delight, they make no true reports unto the soule. Nature hath endowed us with them, that we might know God by things visible, and to raise us up to consider the beauty of the Creatour by the like of his works; these deceitfull Guides do notwithstanding abuse us, and sollicited either by delight, or interest, make Idols unto themselves of all the creatures, and lead us to adore sensible and perishable Gods. <note n="r" place="margin">Misi nuntios meos sensus om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes exteriores ut quarerent te, &amp; non inveni, quia matè quaere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bam. <hi>August. soliloq cap. 31.</hi>

the Government of the Universe, Inferiour things are alwas subject to their superiour: as the earth is lesse noble than the Heavens, it is also lower; it receives their influences, thereof with respect, and all the fruit it beareth, raise themselves up towards the stars, to witnesse that it's fruitfulnesse derives from their Influences. In Civill Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, women are subject unto their husbands, and slaves obey their Masters; in Politique, the people hold of their Sovereign, and the Kings will, is the Subjects laws; but in man this order is reverst by an irregularity, which can be nothing but the punishment of sin: his soule depends upon his body; and in her noblest operations, she is obliged to be advised by the senses.

Thus are our senses the Executours of his fury, the parts of our body are confederate in his faultinesse, and the members which nature hath given us to defend our selves, are the weapons which he makes use of to fight against us.

Desire is the soules course, and she seems to command this nimble heeled passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to put her in possession of what she loves. Hope comes in to the succour of desire, and promiseth her such good successe, as she resolves to make her way through all difficulties, which oppose her designes. If hope meet with more opposition then she imagined, she calls in courage to her aid, which by her valour purchaseth her the enjoyment of what she had long wished for. Such passions as are opposite to these, serves the soule to keep aloofe from what she apprehends. Fear is her flight; she doth her utmost to keep her enemy off; though she be timerous, she mingleth her selfe with hope to effect her designes; and imployes boldnesse to overcome such dangers as threaten her; if her strength be too weak, she falls insensibly into despair; and giving way to griefe, doth of necessity become unhappy. Somtimes she assumes courage in her disasters; sollicited by hatred, animated by desire, and incouraged by despair, she gets the better of the enemy which possesseth her; and findes by experience, that somtimes to be happy, a man must have been miserable.</p>
               <p>These passions have so much affinity with vertue, <note n="k" place="margin">Irasci peccan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiut corrigatur, contristari pro afflicto ut libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retur, timere periclitantine pereat, nescio utrum quisquam sanâ considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione repreben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dat. <hi>August. li 9. de Civit. cap.</hi> 9.</note> as let but never so little care be taken in husbanding them, they may become vertuous.

Audacity is a naturall fortitude, a man must be couragious to be valiant; this vertue is no lesse a work of nature, than of morality; and unlesse a mans constitution contribute towards his generosity, Philosophy with all her coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell, will hardly make him seek out an honourable death. That which is said of Poets, ought to be affirmed of all vertuous men; as these cannot be famous in their profession, unlesse they be borne of that heat which is the soule of <hi>Poesy,</hi> these cannot be valiant, unlesse they be born with that generous heat, which desplseth dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and which boasteth in the losse of life, when glory is won

thereby. Anger doth somwhat resemble justice, the one and the other of them will punish faults; and if the former be not better regulated in the revenge which she takes for injuries, 'tis because she is blinde, and that self-love whereby she is guided, makes her commit excesse. <note n="l" place="margin">Contristati est is secundum Deum, quo enim secundum Deum tristitia est poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitentiam ad sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutem stabilem operatur. 2. ad <hi>Corinth. cap.</hi> 7.

               <p>By all this discourse tis easie to inferre, that the passions are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels which are partiall in their siding with sin, and which are never so much assubjected to the Soul, but that they are alwaies ready to obviate her Power, and ruine her authority: They are like the <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torian</hi> Souldiers, who made merry with their Princes heads, who made and unmade their Sovereignes, onely in reference to their

Anger turnes to fury when not moderated; desire and hope go astray when not regulated; Audacity grows rash, when not held in; and sorrow turns to despaire, when not sweetened; so as all passions in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct us, that Nature is corrupted by sin; and that to assubject them to reason, a Man must guide himself by the motions of Grace.</p>

               <p>AMongst a thousand differences which distinguish Christian Grace from originall righteousnesse, one of the chiefest is, that the former sanctifies the Souls onely, and the other did sanctifie the whole man, and wrought admirable effects in his body. For in the profession of Christianity, the senses are yet Subject to the Illusions of the Devil, objects do yet move the passions; and reason is oft surprised by their motions. The Sacraments do not warrant us from death, and the remedies which Jesus Christ hath left unto his Church do not cure our sicknesses. But in the state of innocency, originall righteousnes was a plentifull spring-head which

               <p>This is so constant a truth, as that mans life is nothing but a long sicknesse which never ends but in death: he is born in sorrow aswell as in sin; his entrance into the world is no lesse painfull, then shamefull; if this monster like the viper, rip up the bowells of his Mother, he himself feels a part of the pain, which he makes her suffer, and he runs as much danger, as she who brings him into the world. Therefore tis that Saint <hi>Austin</hi> sayes handsomly, that to be born, is to begin to suffer, and that to live in the body is to begin to be sick: The disorder of seasons is sufficient to corrupt the best constitutions, and the Alterations which happen in the world make such impressions in the Body as trouble the temper thereof. Though Nature be a wise Mother, that she prepare us for the Summers heat by the moderate warmth of the spring, and that she fits us for the winters cold by the moistnesse of <hi>Autumn,</hi> yet is the body of man so weak as notwithstanding all these precautions, she cannot free it from incommodity; Physicians themselves observe, that every season brings with it its maladie: and that ruling over such humours as accord with them, they never suffer us to enjoy perfect health.</p>
               <p>The Elements agree not better than do the seasons, there is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes some one of them which predominates to the prejudice of the rest, they commit outrages each upon other; and as bloud and chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, discharge themselves when over heated; flegme and Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly do the like when they are corrupted; their good intelligence is fatall to man; this calm threatens him with a terrible storm, and he is never nearer sicknesse, than when in perfectest health; besides these incommodities which spring from his temper, there are others which proceed from indigencie, and which oblige him every day to seek for cure, he is dayly tormented with hunger and thirst, <note n="t" place="margin">

'Tis a lamp that goes out when left without oyle; and a man is so corrupted since sin, as that which we call life, is but a long death; and that which is termed health, is but a continuall sicknesse. Nature is become our punishment, every part of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is bound by the Justice of God to punish us; so as not needing executioners for the satisfaction thereof, it findes enough in our selves to revenge itselfe of us.</p>

                  </note> arise from the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Elements; though the seasons were not unseasonable, and though the heavens should have no bad influences, we should not cease to suffer; our bodily temper suffers for the irregularity of our soules; and there are some evils turned into nature; insomuch as we cannot live without them; Thirst is as usuall as hunger, this malady, though it be violent, ceaseth not to be naturall; those who are never troubled therewithall, passe either for Angels, or for Monsters; History ranks it in the number of Prodigies; and men are more astonished to see a man that did never drink, than to see a man that did never laugh: yet this so common punishment is so cruell, as in five or six days it destroys the strongest men, and makes the most couragious accept of dishonourable conditions. Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which can defend themselves against force, cannot defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves against thirst; and the fire which consumes the entrails, is of more efficacy, than that which blows up walls and bulwarks. Wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching is not much lesse unsupportable than thirst. Tyrants have put malefactors to death by keeping them from sleep. Man must have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course to sleep to refresh himselfe, and must seek to preserve his life in the image of death. If he neglect this remedy, he languish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth away, and his very soule which delights in motion, hath need of this rest, to re-assume it's vigour. But all these evills are but pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimes or sports, in comparison of these which are occasioned by our debaucheries. The stone and gout are punishments which may almost vye with those of the damned, they sieze on the most sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible parts of the body; had they not their intermissions they would cast men into despair; and to free themselves from it, the lawes
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:61993:123"/>
of the Ancients ought to be revived; which permitted the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable to die.</p>
               <p>All the parts of the body hath maladies which assail them; there is not any one which hath not some peculiar torments. The eye which is one of the least, though not of least importancy, is subject to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove an hundred severall diseases; the nerves which give them mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and through which they receive light, are as capable of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, as those by which the armes and legs are moved; the smaller they be, the more susceptible they are of pain, and by how much the parts of the body are the most noble; they seem to be the more painfull. The least hurt in the heart is mortall; and the throne wherein the soule resides is so fraile, as a very vapour is capable to crack it. In fine, the best Physician, who knew not that a man was sinfull, wondred he should be so miserable; and considering his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series, confest he was wholly a disease. <note n="x" place="margin">Totus homo totus morbus est.</note> The soule, which is the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies guest, is also it's executioner; the ones agitations trouble the others humours; great men have little health, the great designes which purchases them so much glory, leaves them but little quiet. Violent agitations alter the constitutions more than the countenance, more men dye of anger and griefe, than by the hands of the hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; lovers, and ambitious men are always in a Fever: the fire which inflames them, consumes them; and the Physician who deals with their body cannot cure their sicknesse, till Philosophy which guides their mindes hath allayed their passions. The soules delights are the bodies punishments, and the same meditation which enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens the understanding, and heats the will, disorders the temper, and alters the constitution; thus the whole life of man, is nothing but a vexatious sicknesse, his noblest operations serve him for punishments, and he cannot purchase knowledge but by the losse of his health.</p>
               <p>If the maladies be vexatious, the remedies are not more pleasing. Physick teacheth, that the remedies which she furnisheth us withall, are but prepared venomes; she cannot drive out sicknesses, but by poisons; and to cure those that are sick, she must seek for Antidotes in the bowels of vipers. She is so unfortunate in her cures, as she cannot assaile the disease, without hurting the party diseased; nor can she strengthen the diseased party without augmenting the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease.

Sleep charms our wearinesse with so much of content, as though it be the picture of death, no man doth abhor it: the slothfull ground their felicity thereon and those who do most desire to live, take de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in dying oft and long.

               </argument>
               <p>A Man must be blinde if he value not beauty; her advantages are so visible, as she is, sure to have the better if her judges have eyes; Beauty is the first perfection which is seen in any one, and which steals away the heart of the beholders. She doth so powerfull forestall the understanding, as we cannot harbour an ill opinion of a handsome personage; and since we are perswaded that the works of Nature are perfect, we are apt to beleeve, that she hath inclosed a fair Soul in a handsome body. <note n="e" place="margin">

                  </note> Tis therefore that the <hi>Platonicks</hi> terme beauty the luster of Goodnesse, and will have her to be the visible Image of an invisible perfection; she hath such power over humane Judgement, as good fortune cannot be expected where there is no handsomenesse. Angels finde their contentment in beholding the beauty of God. Devils think themselves onely unfortunate for having lost the hope of enjoying it, and though it be the cause of their torments, yet is the object of their desires. This perfection ravisheth the will so readily, as the sight of her is sufficient to make her be beloved, she oft-times changeth hatred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to love, and to make her power appear, she delights to make her Enemies her Lovers. We have heard of a daughter that fell in love with him that murthered her Father: the handsome comportment of this Prince blotted all hatred out of her heart, and the beauty which appeared in his countenance forced her to love him, whom by nature and reason she was bound to hate. <note n="f" place="margin">

Did not love make men blind he could never make them in love; did he not hide from them their imperfections whom they love, he should not see so many souldiers fight under his colours; and had he not taught women the secret how to imbellish themselves, Impurity would have long since been banisht from off the earth.

Her odour, naturally as it is, disputes for precedency with the most pleasing perfumes that Art can compose; the placing of her leaves, puts painters, who would imitate her, to their wits ends; yet too boot that she is environed with prickles, and that she seems to share more in the curse of the earth, than other flowers, her life lasts but for a few days; the Sun which gave her life, gives her death, and that fire which enlivens her purple, is extinguished, as soon as lighted. Neither is the beauty of women of long durance, that lustre which bewitcheth men is lost in a few years, and they are unjust in wishing that men should be constant in their love, since the object which gives it birth is so subject to alteration.</p>

               <p>But he never appeared more powerfull then when he set upon the whole Army of the <hi>Israelites,</hi> and when in a moment he made it unchaste, and idolatrous. This wicked spirit, had to no purpose armed the <hi>Midianites</hi> against the <hi>Iews;</hi> all their endeavours proved vain, though their numbers were greater, and their souldiers better warriours, they were ever either repulst or beaten; the very names of <hi>Israelites</hi> wan battells, the glittering of their Arms routed their enemies, and the Elements anticipating the valour of these Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, did most commonly begin the battell. So many bad suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses made the Devill have recourse to his old tricks. He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his partners by the mouth of a faithless Prophet, to set upon those with women, whom he could not overcome by men; and to make use of beauty where strength was bootlesse. Obeying this his counsell, they placed before their Battalions a troop of loose wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who carrying looking glasses, and Idols in their hands, invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the <hi>Israelites</hi> at one and the same time, to lose their conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, and to forgoe their religion. This wile was of so great pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, that the Army in whose favour the heavens had done so many miracles, doth adore these women, and their idols; they forget their duty, to obey their love; and renounce their faith to satisfie their lust.</p>
               <p>He still useth the same cunning, he corrupts Christians, as he did the <hi>Israelites,</hi> and the beauty of women is the smallest temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, wherewith he astonisht the courage of men. A handsome wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is the Courts plague; after she hath once resolved to bereave hearts, and to have servants, she purchaseth as many subjects to the devill, as she deprives Christ Jesus off. After once she hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to hazard the reputation of an honest woman, to purchase the name of a stately dame; she turnes to be a false Diety to which all unchaste people offer incense, an Idoll, which makes more I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatours, than impiety makes Libertines; a contagion which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken in by all the senses, sweeps away more men than the plague

Her hair is a net wherein Lyons and Tygers are taken, her strength like that of <hi>Sampson,</hi> lies in her weaknesse, she imployes onely these weak arms to overcome the couragious, and makes use onely of these small threads to stop the course of the most uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant. The lillies when on her face, lose their purity, and the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent rose becomes guilty upon her cheeks: and as the spider makes her poyson of the best things, she composeth the venome where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with she infects souls, of the fairest flowers. Modesty and Majesty, which else where defend vertue, do corrupt it in the person of a handsome woman; and these two advantages which makes her beauty the more powerfull make it also the more dangerous; her very gate is not without affectation and fault, her studied steps have a certain becomingness which is fatall to those that behold them; each pace steals a heart from some of her servants, and doing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing without design, she either wounds or kils those indiscreet ones which approach her.</p>
               <p>In fine, beauty is so pernicious, as God himself who extracts Grace from sin, makes use thereof onely to punish his Enemies, it is more dreadfull in his hands then thunder, and he hath tane more venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance by womens allurements, then by the arms of souldiers. He ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in'd <hi>Hamans</hi> fortunes by <hi>Hesters</hi> countenance, the gracefull demea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor which he indued her withall, made <hi>Ahasuerus</hi> condemn his Favorite, and the death of this insolent enemy of the <hi>Iews</hi> is not so much an effect of <hi>Mordecais</hi> wisedom, as of his Nieces beauty. God chose out a widow to slay <hi>Holofernes,</hi> he obteined two victories o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver this Conqueror by the means of one onely woman; he took his heart from him by her eyes, and his head by her hands; he made first use of her beauty, then of her courage, and would have the Assyrians defeat to begin by love and end by murther. Thus are handsome women the Ministers of Gods fury, he imploys <hi>Hesters</hi>
                  <pb n="224" facs="tcp:61993:130"/>
and <hi>Iudeths</hi> as souldiers to revenge his quarrels, and beauty which causeth impurity doth oft-times punish it.</p>
               <p>We see no faults in the creature from whence God draws not some advantage; our weaknesse is the cause of our penitency, if we cannot alter, we cannot repent; and if we had the constancy of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, we might have the opiniatricy of Devils. Our offences serve to humble us, and the proudest spirits cannot think upon their sins without confusion. Concupiscence, which is one of the originals of our disorders is one of the foundations of Grace: <hi>Adams</hi> sin fastens us to Jesus Christ, and the miseries which we suffer under, make us have recourse to divine Mercy. <note n="e" place="margin">Vela caput &amp; mul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Gods beauty is then that which can onely securely beloved, tis that, that we ought to sigh, all other desires are unjust.

Pleasures do enter-shock, and always leave some of our senses in languishment or need; pains agree in their assailing us, and though they should not come in a crowd, one alone is sufficient to make it selfe be felt by all the parts of the body; their straight union makes their mischiefes common, and if the head suffer, the tongue complains; the eyes weep, and the heart groanes.

As soon as we begin to live, we begin to die. Death shares with us in all the moments of our life, it takes unto it selfe what is past, because that is certain, and leaves to us only what is to come, because that is uncertain. So as by a strange mis-fortune, the increase of our life is the diminution thereof.

               <p>Tis perhaps for this reason that the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> (that holy language which the blessed shall make use of in heaven) imployes but one and the same word to expresse both life and death, with the difference of one only point, to teach us, that death and life, are divided onely by that moment which unites them.

The future time is not as yet, hope which expects it cannot advance it, and wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom which hath an eye unto it, cannot dissipate the obscurity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; it is lesse at our disposall then the time that is past, and for all the vain conjectures which we may flatter our selves withall, we know
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:61993:132"/>

age which is esteemed the pleasantest of mans life, and which I think the most dangerous, lasts no longer than doth his Boyish-age, it ends when youth begins, which lasts somewhat longer than the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts of life which did precede it, it begins at Thirty years of age, and ends not till sixty, old age serves it for a Sepulcher, and when the head is covered with snow, tis time to prepare for death. For this age is shortest of all the rest, if it have any hope, tis ill grounded, and the sicknesses wherewith it is assailed, are so many summons to the grave. If man arrive at that extremity of the age we tearm decrepit, he languisheth in pain, he calls in death to his aide, and the sorrows he suffers makes him think life tedious. <note n="o" place="margin">Punctum est quod vivimus, &amp; adhuc puncto minus, sed hoc minimum specie quadam longio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris spatii natura divisit, aliud ex hoc infantiam fecit, aliud ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lescentiam, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liud senectutem.

               <p>OF all the pains which sin hath procured us, death is the most cruell and the most common; all others have their reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and self-love teacheth us how to shun them; we by our industry and labour overcome the earths sterility. We fence our selves from the shame of our nakednesse by the means of our clothes; we save our selves from the injury of the aire, and unsea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonablenesse of weather by the commodiousnesse of buildings; physick furnisheth us with remedies against sicknesse, and reformeth our temper by the government which it prescribes us; Arts are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented onely to free us from the miseries of life; and the greatest part of Artificers labour onely to fence men from the punishment of sin. But death is a punishment as rigorous, as inevitable; hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane wit hath not yet been able to free man from it. All her care cannot make a man live a hundred years; our first fathers lived longer, and the heavens which would people the earth by their means, prolonged their life to allow them leisure for it: but they died after some hundred years, and the oldest amongst them could not attain to a thousand years.</p>
               <p>The rigour of this punishment doth equall it's necessity, for death is deafe to pitty, tears cannot appease it, and whatsoever

               <p>The second punishment which our decree bringeth, is that in not expressing what kind of death we shall die, we are obliged to fear all sorts of death. There is nothing more certain than this punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; neither is there any thing more secret. Every one knows he must die, every day affords us proofs and examples of it; our friends and enemies confirme this truth, no man is so ignorant, or vain-glorious as to doubt it; the sepulchres of Kings are faithfull witnesses thereof, and those heads for which the lives of a whole Nation are exposed, make us see that death spares no body; but the manner thereof is as unknown, as the hour is uncertain. The stars do not shew the particulars thereof, and unlesse the heavens re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veale it, the devill cannot foretell it to those that serve him; our decree pitcheth not upon any one, that we may stand in fear of all; and after the example of Princes which have ended their lives by deaths, from which their qualities ought to have warranted them, we may justly apprehend all. It may be 'twill be naturall, it may be violent; it may be 'twill sieze on us in war, it may be in peace, it may be 'twill be short and cruell, it may be lesse cruell, but lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing; the Judge which hath condemned us, hath not been pleased to expresse himselfe therein, to the end, that the fear of death might be a severer punishment unto us, then death it selfe; it may suffice us to know that he is incensed, and that we may justly expect from his just anger whatsoever death our sin deserves. The truth is we can suffer but one; the weaknesse of our constitution doth not permit both the waters to drown us, the fire to burn us, and the wilde beasts to devoure us, but the darknesse of our decree obligeth us to fear all these punishments, <note n="c" place="margin">Erge tu i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

We carry the principles of death about us, and from once that originall righteousnesse ceased to appease the differences between those parts whereof we are composed we began to die. It is not necessary that the world disorder it selfe, to bereave us of our lives; though the seasons should not be put out of their pace, we should not cease to perish. And if death be to be feared, we must resolve to fear life. There are some people who apprehend any thing that happens of disorder in the world, and who grow pale as often as they see rivers over-flow their banks, as often as they hear thunder, or see earth-quakes: They think that every clap of thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der comes in pursuit of them, and that the sea exceeds not her bounds but to drown them on the earth; but the causes of our death are much lesse violent, and more naturall.

Mans immortality in the state of innocency, was not an effect of nature; he lost this priviledge as soon as he lost his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse, and experience taught him, that nature without grace could not keep him from death. <note n="n" place="margin">Haec omnia elementa quibus mundus admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistratur tam causa vivendi sunt quam viae mortis. <hi>Senec.

               <p>Yet is it certain that in the condition wherein we are, sleep is a punishment of sin, and had man never sinned, he had never proved those disquiets wherewith he is agitated during his rest; Nature would have born a respect to her Sovereigns sleep, the elements which formed his body would not have troubled his rest, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours would have been so mild, as stupefying all the senses, they would have left the soul at liberty.

Though we be not stoicks, and though the fond imaginations of the haughty Philosophers did as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel give against reason as truth, we forbear not to confesse with them, that sorrow is to be preferred before joy, and that it is better for a man to suffer pain, then to tast pleasure. <note n="i" place="margin">Imitatrix bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni voluptas est, malorum mat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>This unjust vanity is crept even into religion: we oft-times judge of Saints greatnesse, by the eminency of their births, we read the life of a Prince with more admiration then that of a Peasant, and be it either that vertue be rarer in Courts than in cottages, or that we be rather born away with appearances than truths, a common action in the person of a Prince seems noble to us. All things appear great un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath a Crown: and we are so accustomed to flatter Princes, as they passe for good if they be not bad.

'Tis true that <hi>Caesar</hi> would have had reason to complain had he been otherwise dealt withall; since all Nations treat their usurpers so, and reserve all their praises for those that rob them of their liberty.</p>
               <p>Great faults are the noblest vertues; Princes who shed most bloud, receive most honour; robbery and murther are the steps whereby Tyrants get into Kings Thrones; people put not so great a valuation upon those who have defended them, as on those who have conquered them; and all things in the world are so out of order, as usurpation in Monarches is more glorious than succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. The one is the work of Nature, the other of Fortune; they owe their election to their subjects love, and are bound for their conquests to their souldiers valour. Triumph, which was vertues highest recompence amongst the <hi>Romans,</hi> was granted onely to such as had committed most murthers, and sackt most Towns; renown was not to be purchased in that Commonwealth, but by violence and injustice.

Let us conclude then that a man must be a fool to imagine that honour is the recompence of vertue, and that man never sought af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter these imaginary contentments, till after he had lost those which were solid and reall. Mans honour consists in his duty; of all the testimonies which he receives there are none but those of his consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which can satisfie him: knowing that vertue depends upon Grace, he gives the glory to him who hath indued him with the strength, &amp; he confesseth that God <note n="c" place="margin">Cùm Deus co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

The Devil who cannot efface his desires which are as the remainder of innocency, is content to corrupt them, and to propose unto him false objects to divert him from true ones. To say truth, man takes no longer pleasure in any thing save in criminall delights, the inclination which he hath for the <hi>Summum Bonum,</hi> serves onely to keep the further from it; and for not taking his aim aright, he strays from his end whilest he thinks to draw neer it: the love which he bears to knowledge is but a meer curiosity, he loves truth like a whore, not like a legitimate wife, he seeks her out onely to passe away his time, as oft as she blames his disorders, he turns his love into ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, and becomes her persecutor whose servant he was.</p>

In so high a pitch of fortune, where nothing is wanting to compleat the felicity of their senses; their soule is weakned, and being char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by false praises, they believe what they desire. They imagine that death dares not assaile a Monarch which the world stands in awe of, and whom fortune reverenceth: They make a God-head of their greatnesse; they despise such honours as are not divine; and though sicknesses which advertise them of their weaknesse, assure them of their deaths; they hope for an un-exampled miracle, and perswade themselves that immortality is a favour wherewith heaven will honour their merit: The guards which watch about their Palaces, might easily cure them of this errour; did not flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery which makes them as stupid, as insolent, bereave them both of their judgement, and modesty: the conspiracies which are made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their persons, the parties which are packt in their Territories, the cunning which is used to corrupt their subjects loyalty, are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons good enough to abate their pride; and to destroy that foolish confidence which feeds their vanity. <note n="g" place="margin">Magna fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na magna ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitus. <hi>Senec.</hi>

               <p>Though God will suffer us to share with him in his perfections, though he permit that our vertues be a shadow of his divine attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, that our condition be such as we may imitate them; and though a man be not rationall unlesse he endeavour to expresse in his soule an image of divinity, yet amongst that number of perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which we adore in God, some seem to be advantagious to us, other some prejudiciall.

               <p>But there are some other attributes in God which one nor can, nor ought to imitate, save with an humble reservednesse; it is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to wish for knowledge; and as our first father lost himselfe onely out of a desire of being too knowing, the desire thereof is oft-times sinfull, and the seeking after it always dangerous. Beauty is one of the excellentest perfections which religion acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in God, 'tis the chiefe object of our beatitude; and were not God as beautifull as he is good, he would not be the desire, and the happinesse of all rationall creatures: <note n="i" place="margin">Dignitas for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mae gravior possidentibus, &amp; appetentibus exitiosa, exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta tentationibus, &amp; circumdata scandalis. <hi>Tert.</hi>
                  </note> yet we cannot seek after the possession of this advantage without danger; in women pride accompanies beauty; chastity and she, are not upon good tearms, and 'tis a kinde of prodigy, when a woman is as chaste, as fair. Greatnesse and power are two of Gods Attributes, which merit e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall honour, each of them inspires fear into the soule of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; if they be ravisht with his goodnesse, his Majesty astonisheth them; and if his beauty oblige them to love him, his power en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forceth them to reverence him. Thus dividing themselves between respect and love, they love him as their Father, and adore him as their Sovereign: <note n="k" place="margin">Iustitia ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibet Deum Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trem &amp; Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num: Patrem potestate blan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da, Dominum severa, Patrem diligendum piè, Dominum ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendum neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sario. <hi>Tertul. contra Marc. lib. 2. cap.</hi> 12.</note> yet this perfection which preserves the honour of God amongst men, cannot without danger be wished for; who prescribes not bounds to the desire thereof falls easily into errour; and he who pretends to his greatnesse who hath no equall, cannot avoid his just anger. <hi>Lucifers</hi> undoing was for that he would reign in heaven; if pride was his sin, greatnesse was the object thereof; and if that glorious Angell be now a devill, 'tis because his ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made him wish himselfe a God. The cause of his disaster, is oft-times the cause of ours, that which drove him from heaven, banisht <hi>Adam</hi> out of Paradise; this children of the unfortunate fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, mistaking his fault, bear his punishment; and finde by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, that of all worldly conditions, the most glorious is most dangerous, and the most absolute, is most faulty. It is more safe to obey, than to command; and let Kings be never so godly in their Thrones, they run more hazard in their welfare then their subjects
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:61993:150"/>
do; the higher they be raised up by greatnesse, the more are they threatened by vanity; that which draws them neerer God, keeps them the farther from him; and the same Majesty which makes them his images, makes them oft-times his enemies.</p>
               <p>This condition placeth Kings upon the brink of a precipice, <note n="l" place="margin">Imperium cupientibus, ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hil medium in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter summa &amp; praecipitia. <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit. histor. lib.</hi> 5</note> the higher it is, the more dangerous is it, and like the highest moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains is always exposed to storms: so great is the danger which doth accompany it, as it may be doubted, whether a Scepter be not aswell the punishment of Gods justice, as the favour of his mercy. The first King of <hi>Israel</hi> was a reprobate, his election which was somewhat miraculous freed him not from sin, neither could the prayers of a Prophet appease Gods anger: his fault at first was but impatience, and in the progresse thereof, but a slight enterprize upon the priestly office. The presence of his enemies whereby he was obliged to fight, might serve him for an excuse, and the laws of war, which will have a man make use of advantages, was a reason of state, which might have sheltred him in the opinion of Polititians. Yet this fault which had so fair an appearance, was punished by the routing of his army, he found death, when he sought for glory; and the same mountain which was the pitcht field wherein he set upon his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, was the scaffold whereon he was punished by Divine Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice.</p>
               <p>Poets who never read our scripture, judged aright, that Crowns were not always set upon the most innocent heads, and that king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms were oftner the punishment of sin than the reward of vertue. <hi>Iocasta</hi> made use of this reason to divert <hi>Polinices</hi> from the war which he undertook against <hi>Eteocles,</hi> she assured him, that without troubling himself with fighting, he should be sufficiently revenged of a reigning brother, <note n="m" place="margin">Ne metus, poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas &amp; quidem solvet grazes, reguabit. <hi>Senec in Thebaid.</hi>
                  </note> for that a kingdome was a severe punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that of all his ancestors there was not any Sovereign who had not been unfortunate,</p>
               <p>Though this Maxime be not always true in Christianity, and that there have been Kings, whose Thrones have served them for steps to mount up to heaven by, 'tis alwaies very dangerous to be raised to a condition which permits them to doe what they please, and with not bereaving them of their passions unrulinesse, affords them means of satisfying them: For in this supream authority, which hath no arbitrator, nor censurer, they can do what they will, their

All women are not couragious enough to expose their lives to save their honour: those who have worth enough to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist the vain discourses of men, have not strength sufficient to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand a Princes promises, and there are but very few who will not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard their chastity to triumph over the liberty of a Monarch. If they be greedy they will find a thousand pretences to enrich themselves at their subjects costs, and to fill their cofers with the spoyles of Orphans and Widows. If they be cruell they will find fitting Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters for their fury: glorious names are given unto their faults, all their revenges passe for acts of justice; they are termed the Fathers of the people, when they wash their hands in their subjects bloud; their anger is animated by servile praise, and their cruelty incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged by approbation: so as Kings have no greater enemies to their welfare then this uncurbed licentiousnesse which accompanieth their greatnesse, and that absolute power which furnisheth them with means to execute all their designs.</p>

to their successours; who charge their children to revenge their injuries; and who shewing a face of war in time of peace, do meditate murther when they cannot commit it. I wonder not that the same thoughts which did possesse them in their life, possesse them likewise in their death; and that those who delighted in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but bloud, did dream on nought but cruelties; since an ill ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit is an invisible chain which keeps the will captive, and will not suffer it to abhor a crime, which hath alway been pleasing to it.

                  <hi>Rome</hi> had much a do to forgo this cruell pastime, after she had embraced the Christian Religion: people ran to publick places, to see men fight; they were taught to kill one another handsomly, and with a good grace; publick schools were erected to teach this bloudy exercise; there were Masters who taught how to observe method in murthering, who led their disciples into their <hi>Arenae,</hi> or <hi>Theators</hi> for fencing; and who trying their dexterity themselves incouraged them to fight by example; he was most praised, who shed most bloud, and a man sorely wounded who had killed many men was led about in triumph. Sin must needs reign in their hearts, since it had driven thence all sense of humanity; and that making man-slaughter a vertue, it had perswaded them that glory consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in injustice, and pleasure in cruelty: this madnesse, grew in time to so great a height, as to make killing more easie, and the sport more pleasing; men were to fight stark naked with offensive wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, but none defensive. Obscenity was joyned to cruelty, to the end that one might content two passions with one and the same spectacle, and that the sight of a dying wretch might make them love his murtherer; yet these combates are but the shadows of war; the <hi>Gladiators</hi> fury is but the souldiers entrance; Companies were fill'd up which these people nurst up in bloud; and when re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruits were to be had, those were sought for in the <hi>Arenae,</hi> who had made themselves famous by the death of their Companions.

more just, nor yet lesse cruell; so brutish a passion cannot be but in mindes where sin doth Tyrannize: a man must renounce both reason and Grace, to obey so blind a fury; and one must cease to be either rationall or faithfull, if he believe that a Gentlemans Glory consists in Murther; yet this errour is become a custome, Gentlemen love ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to lose their heads upon a scaffold, and dye by the hands of a hangman, then to be failing in an occasion where they know their conscience is in an ill condition, and that they are in danger of lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing both soul and body; fear of shame hath more power over them then fear of Hell; they chuse rather to incurre Gods anger, and their Princes, then the peoples reproach, and by a foolish extravagancy, they hazard their soul to preserve their honour.</p>
               <p>As this blind Passion differs not much from that which animates Conquerors to war, so doth she likewise proceed from the same principle; the one and the other proceed from sin, which having put us at ods with our selves, puts us likewise at ods with our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; and perswades us that all means are lawfull whereby we may acquire honour.

This metall not being to be divided without diminution, it kindles war amongst men, makes them severally minded, divides their wils, and causeth all those differences which justice endevours to decide. In the state of innocency, men possest all things in common, avarice had not as yet found out bounders to sever fields: Kings had not yet drawn lines to divide the sea: as Light is an universall good, so was the earth a common heritage, and this charitable mother was fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full enough to nourish all her children. The poorest man that was, was a King of the whole world. Ambition had not yet form'd states, nor built strong holds upon their Frontiers, all things were possest in common, without any jealousie; self-love had not as yet perswaded any one, that to be master of a thing, all other men must be deprived of it.

Stuffs were unknown, because uselesse; colours appeared not in Lustre, save in pinks and roses; and necessity (which is not the mother of invention, but as it is the daughter of sin) had not obliged man to seek for remedies for miseries, which he did not as yet suffer: but as soon as he would be rich, he became poor; as soon as he heaped together imaginary goods, he lost such as were reall; and when he tilled the ground to make it more fruitfull, the earth punished his avarice by a universall sterility: she who together with fruites, bore flowers, bears now no roses without prickles: the spring which min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled her beauties with Autumns fertility was divided from thence by summers scorching heat, and winters benumming cold.

               <p>Adultery followed murther; and chastity which had defended her selfe against what man could say to undermine her, could not defend her selfe against riches.

               <p>But say that gold should not set men together by the ears, and that peace should not be troubled with the insatiable desire of riches, yet would it be always prejudiciall to a sinner, and he must wish to be poor, if he would recover his innocency.

But riches deprive him of this advantage by affording him means to do what he desires, and make a guilty man absolute, by bereaving him of the happy disability whereinto poverty had brought him. <note n="x" place="margin">Inflant ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos divitiae, superbiam pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unt, invidiam contrabunt, &amp; eo us<expan>

Thus is gold the instrument of all evill, it attempts chastity, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts justice, sets upon innocency, and oppresseth poverty. When heaven is offended with a sinner, it needs but onely make him rich, to undo him; and make him wealthie to make him wretched; 'tis equivalent to putting a good sword into a mad mans hands, to the preserving of poyson in a christall glasse to one that is frantick, and to the setting of a blind man upon the top of a precipice tapistred with Jessemine and Lillies.</p>
               <p>On the contrary, poverty is the sanctuary of innocency, there are fewer faults where lesse of abundance.

This truth appears by the use which they make of the miseries of corrupted nature, for self-love extracts sins from thence, divine love vertues; the one augments our evils whilest she would diminish them, the other diminisheth them, whilst she would augment them. From the scorn whereinto we are fallen since our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belllion, self-love hath formed a design of raising her self up; and (giving against Gods Justice) of finding her greatnesse in her abase<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Divine love hath extracted humility from thence, and with an innocent piece of cunning, she leads us to glory by contempt. Self-loue raiseth despair from death, which is sins chiefest punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and divine love raiseth from thence a sacrifice, which expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ats our offences, and gives honour to Gods justice from the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures revolt, which doth revenge our outrages done to heaven: self-love argues riot in apparel, magnificence in buildings, and all those other means which we have invented to defend our selves from the injuries of seasons, and divine love, which always prefers the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of heaven before her own interest, argues repentance from thence, which teacheth us to undergo this persecution with humility. In fine, from the losse of our welfare self-loue hath made avarice arise, which justling Gods designs, undertakes to make man richer in his state of sin, then ever he was in that of innocency, and divine love, which takes pleasure in saving of a sinner by losing him, raiseth po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty from thence, depriving her self even of those things which her judge would not take from his enemies, that she may appease him.

               <p>Whilest man was innocent, he was rich; the sun by his heat made the earth fruitfull, he cherished it, without scorching; and his influences were so well tempered, as trees were always covered with fruit, leaves, and flowers; the fields were fertile without labour, every country bore every thing; and without crossing the seas, that was found in any one part of the world, which all the rest pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced. Beasts which afforded nourishment for men yeilded milk in aboundance, running waters were never dried up; and provision was uselesse where there was perpetuall plenty. Bees wrought without wearing themselves, they made their hives at all times, and the earth being continually covered with flowers, there was no season wherein they did not make honey and wax. Man being clothed with innocency, he stript not beasts of their skins to cloth himself, the art of spinning was not as then found out, or if it were known to worms: man did not molest their labours; he admired the industry of their workmanship, the magnificency of their Tombs, and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them to reassume life where they had left it, he delighted to see them after having been dead arise again.</p>
               <p>The elements not having as yet vowed his undoing, he was not bound to guard himself from their injuries, the seasons were so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, as he neither feared heat nor cold; trees were his shelter from them both, and those which afforded him shade in the day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, served him for covering in the night. If gold were already ript out of the bowels of the earth, it was rankt amongst such things as are esteemed of more for their beauty, then profit. Man thought himself rich enough without that metall; having all things at his command he needed not to buy them: and art not being as yet come into the succour of Nature, he contented himself with looking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what he could not make use of.

But when man became faulty, he became poor; hee lost all his wealth, in losing the <hi>Summum Bonum,</hi> and that selfe same moment which robb'd him of his innocency, threw him headlong into poverty. The earth grew barren under his feet, her fruitfulnesse brought forth nothing but thornes; her bowels must be ript open ere she yeilded fruit, and she must be threatned with iron in her bosome to make her nourish us. Trees shook off their leaves, when winter had disrobed them, men thought that nature was drawing toward her end, and that the earth ceasing to be his Palace, grew to be his Sepulchre: shame shewing him that he was naked, made him make himselfe clothes of leaves, and cold which made him sensible of his sinfulnesse, forced him to apparell himselfe with skins.

               <p>Grace, which doth not abandon even the sinfull, taught him how to use this his punishment, and to turn hie poverty into an il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrious vertue. He began to condemne perishable things, and to wish for things eternall; he endeavoured to forgo earth, that he might raise himselfe up to heaven; he had such happy successe in his designes, as he found plenty in poverty; and confest that that vertue had been more advantagious to him then innocency. To say truth; this pain was glorious when it became voluntary; and from once that man began to suffer indigency with humility, he found that God was his Father, Heaven his inheritance, Jesus Christ his Redeemer, and that the holiest blessings were his recompences.

                  </note> and these two conditions are equally rewarded in the Gospell to teach us, that poverty is a kind of Martyrdom. To say truth, if men do miracles, when they overcome pain, when they tire their Torturers, when they triumph over Tyrants, and vanquish the Elements, and wild beasts, do not they do wonders when they preserve poverty, amidst riches? sobriety amongst Festivals? when they go naked, amidst the pomp of apparell? when they are humble amidst ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours? and when they persevere to refuse the Goods which the devill promiseth them, which the world offers them, and which the flesh propounds unto them? ought not they to be crowned, who overcome the world with all it's promises, who contemne the devill with all his illusions, and who tame the flesh with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence thereof?</p>
               <p>But in the advantages of poverty, we ought to observe the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulinesse of our nature, which is reduced into such a condition, as she cannot without danger make use of what she hath of good: she cannot without injustice pretend to her ancient riches, neither can she acquire new wealth without avarice; we must look upon the things of this world without desiring them, we must live upon the earth, as in a place of exile, and to be happy and innocent, <note n="m" place="margin">Si vis vaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re animo aut pauper fit <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

To free a mans selfe from these misfortunes, he must grow familiar with poverty, he must sweeten his pain by suffering it patiently, and look upon all the things of the world, as upon
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:61993:165"/>
goods which we had lost before were born. We are ruined in the person of our first father; our defeat as well as our default preceded our use of reason, and the same fault which took from us our inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, bereft us of our riches. If we make use of the blessings of the earth, 'tis out of mercy: if the Sun light us, the earth support us, and the fruits thereof do nourish us, 'tis an obligation which we owe unto our God: when once he pronounced the decree of our death, our goods were confiscated to him; the power of making use of them, is a priviledge which we hold of his goodnesse, and he deals with us, as we do with those malefactors which we suffer to live in prison, after their sentence of death is past: if they dispose of their goods, 'tis by their Prince his favour; and if they leave them to their children, 'tis by his permission. Thus we ought to think that nothing belongs to us in this world, that God gives us all which he takes not from us, and that he makes use of his own rights, when he re-demands that which he had but lent us.</p>
               <p>When Famine doth dispeople the earth, when all our labour cannot overcome her sterility, and when the seed we sow answers not our expectation, we ought to adore Gods justice, which having sentenced us to death, hath reserved unto himself the kind of our punishment. <note n="n" place="margin">Dominus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit Dominus ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stulit fit nome<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <argument>
                  <p>That Apparell is a mark of sin</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IF whole man be but meer vanity, if Nature be out of order by his disobedience, if his soul, which hath the honour to be the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of God, and which boasts of her innocency, ceaseth not to find death in his sin; if the will which joyned with Grace is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of merit, be more inclined to vice then vertue; if his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing which enlightens all the faculties of the soul, be more ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of errour then of truth; if all his knowledge be but meer ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance; if his most perspicuous vertues want not their faults; and if his body be his souls prison, we must not wonder that the necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of apparel be a punishment of his fault, as well as riot therein is a mark of his vain glory. But as it often fals out, that we are most ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with things of least consideration, we find by experience, that there are women in the world, who would rather have their souls sullied, then their cloths; <note n="p" place="margin">Nullarum foeminarum ferè pretiofior cultus quam quarum pudor vilis est. <hi>Cyprian. de ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit. virgin.</hi>
                  </note> who would rather have the state be out of order, then their head attire; and who would be lesse troubled to see their honour steined, then their gown. To disabuse these weak women, they must be made know, that luxury in apparell deserves to be despised by men, and to be punished by God.</p>
               <p>Cloaths have two uses, which are equally lawfull, the first is to cover our nakednesse, and to hide our body, which began to be shamefull when it ceased to be innocent, <hi>Adam</hi> could not endure himself when he had lost originall righteousnesse, and the shame which infused upon his sin, made him seek out leaves to hide that from his eyes which did displease his soul, he was afraid of himself, when he saw his body did no longer obey reason: he was afraid to offend nature by his nakednesse, not having as yet seen any other monster then himself, he withdrew himself into a wood, and not being able to shun himself, he endevoured to cover himself. <note n="q" place="margin">Fecit quoque Dominus Deus <hi>Adae</hi> &amp; uxori<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <pb n="291" facs="tcp:61993:166"/>
The second use of Apparell is to shelter us from the injury of seasons, <note n="r" place="margin">Tegendo ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini necessitas praecessit, dehinc ornando ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio successit. <hi>Tertul. de pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio. cap.</hi> 4.</note> and to free our bodies from the rigour of the Elements; for man had no sooner violated Gods Commandements, but all the creatures rebelled against him: beasts began to grow savage, and retired themselves into the woods, that they might no longer treat with a rebell; those which are now reclaimed owe their mildnesse to our cunning, and stay not with us but because we have drawn them from the Forrests; if they obey us, 'tis out of hope of some advantage; and our rebellion having freed them from their oath of Allegiance, which they had taken in Paradise, we must feed them, if we will have any service from them. Those which do reserve their naturall fiercenesse, submit not un-inforced to our will, they must be made to suffer before they be tamed, and our power being Tyrannicall, their obedience is constrained. They are slaves which serve but by force, and who to free themselves from their servitude attempt somtimes upon our lives.</p>
               <p>At the same time when the beasts fore-went their mildnesse, the Elements changed their qualities; <note n="s" place="margin">Nullum est e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lementum quod homini aliquod genus mortis non minetur.</note> those four bodies whereof all other bodies are composed, declared war one against another to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict us, and breaking the bonds which nature had prescribed them, intrencht one upon another, to the end, their division might be our punishment. They did that to punish us, which greatest enemies use to revenge themselves; they endangered their own losse out of a desire to destroy us. The earth which had served us for a nurse, became barren to make us perish by famine; she grew hard under our feet to weary us: forgoing her flowers where with she adorned her selfe to appear more pleasing to us, she loaded her selfe with thorns to prick us; she opened her bowels to bury us; and she who grounded upon her own proper weight, was always immoveable, quaked under our feet to work our astonishment. The Sea w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> judged aright, that our ambition &amp; avarice would not be contented with the Empire of the earth, <note n="t" place="margin">Nihil tam ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pax sortuito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum quam ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re. <hi>Tacit.</hi>

the Magazine of his Thunder and Lightnings, sent Pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences into the world, turned a simple sicknesse into a contagion, and carrying corruption through all parts, did oft-times change the earth into a fatall sepulcher. <note n="u" place="margin">Ignis an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini in hac vita perniciosior an utilior jure du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitari potest.</note> Fire being the most active of all the Elements, did us more harm then all the rest; for this body which seems to be but a pure spirit, and by which the Angels themselves did not disdain to be called, crept into the Thunder, and agreeing with it's enemy, formed storms wherein the waters mingled with flames of fire seem to conspire mans death, and the worlds over-throw; contrary to it's nature, which seeks out high places, it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scends, and gliding into the entrails of the earth, excites earthquakes, consumes mountains, and devours whole Towns: to revenge it it selfe for the wrongs which we make it suffer by making it a slave to all Arts, it burns those who come nigh it, it consumes what is given it, and not interessing it selfe with mens designes, it oft-times mars their workmanship.</p>
               <p>But man was not so sensible of all these persecutions, as of that of the Sun; for this glorious constellation drew up ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant vapours, spred abroad mortall influences, disordered the course of the seasons, parted the Spring from the Autumne, which were all one in the state of innocency; stript the Trees of their leaves in winter, withered the flowers in Summer, and bereft the earth of her ornaments, and riches. Amidst so many disorders, man was bound to make him clothes, and to rob his subjects that he might defend himselfe against his enemies. He hunted wilde beasts, clothed himselfe with their skins; he who had aspired to make himselfe a God, was brought to a condition of decking him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sefe with the hides of Animals, and learnt to his cost, that no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell is proofe for all seasons, but that of Innocency.</p>
               <p>Thus his being necessitated to cloth himselfe is a mark of his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, let him do what he can to turn this punishment into brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <note n="x" place="margin">O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The second designe of those who delight in sumptuous apparell is to please those that look upon them, to entangle souls in their nets, to purchase lovers, or slaves, to govern by the pomp of their apparell, as Monarchs do by the terrour of their Arms. This is the more usuall, and the more dangerous motive: the more usuall, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause vain glory seeks out a Theater, because self-love, as well as ambition, will have spectatours. <note n="c" place="margin">Quod pro so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ld inani gloria vestimentum pretiosius quoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritur, res ipsa t statur, quia nemo vult ibi pretiosis vesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus indui, ubi ab aliis non po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terit videri. <hi>Greg.

                  </note> To say truth, women do not greatly care for dressing themselves when they are alone; solitari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is an enemy to pomp; a body is soon weary of linifying him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe when he means not to appear, the pain he findes in doing it makes him lose the pleasure of it; and as Peacocks close up their plumes when no body beholds them, women neglect their dressing when no body admires them. They reserve their pearls and dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds for great meetings; Courts, and Masks, are the occasions whereupon they heighten their beauty; and when they have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther witnesses to observe them, nor servants to adore them, selfe love is not of power enough to make them adorn themselves.</p>
               <p>As this motive is the more usuall, so is it the more sinfull; for to boot that a woman that will cause love in another, runs danger of being caught therewithall her selfe; that it is hard to carry fire to ones neighbour, without self-burning; 'tis assuredly to imitate the devill, to serve for instruments to wicked spirits, to lose the souls that Jesus Christ would save, and to present poison, or a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard, to mad men, who would kill themselves. Let women dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guise their designes how artificially they please, let them excuse their intentions by their pretences; the endeavouring to seem plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to men, is never blamelesse, the desire of entangling them is always sinfull, and the care they take in attiring themselves, either to captivate them, or to continue them captives, is equally preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall to their chastity.

                  <p>That the shame which accompanieth Nakedness, is a punishment for our offence.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>PHilosophers who knew not the secret of originall sin, thought nature rather to be the step-dame, then the mother of man, and that she had not given such testimony of her care of his preservation, as of that of other creatures: beasts are born with their weapons and their apparell; they are provided either of hair or wool to fence them from the cold, and armed either with horns, or claws to defend themselves against violence, those of the weaker sort have their wiles to free themselves from their pursuers, and if they want both strength and cunning, nature hath furnished them with agility to shun their enemies who hunt after them; thus we see that Lyons are armed with teeth and claws, and that these generous animals confiding in force, never refuse to fight when combate is offered, bulls have their horns, stags their coverts, wild bores their tusks, and all these differing defences, are so well munited, as a man cannot set upon them without danger of being hurt. Hunting is an exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:61993:169"/>
wherein danger is mixt with delight, if the hunters give blows, they oft-times receive some, and if deer or wild goats suffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be tame, 'tis not without revenge. Foxes have so many wiles, as it is experienced as well in hunting as in war; that it is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sier to overcome a couragious enemy, then a crafty one. Does, Hindes, and Hares, are so swift of foot, as dogs nor horses can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not overtake them; these timerous beasts find their safety in their feet, and as the <hi>Parthians</hi> fight retreating, these overcome their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies by running away.</p>

He makes triall of the rigour of the elements, yet cannot keep himself uninjured by them: he is exposed to the fury of his enemies, and wants weapons to fight them: and nature dealing with him, as with a monster or an illegitimate child; affords him onely tears to bewail himself; he must be brought by time to the use of reason, before he can either make himself cloths or weapons, for fourteen years space he is a prey for wild beasts, and did not necessity make him ingenious, he would be the most miserable of all creatures. <note n="g" place="margin">Cortex ambit arborem, pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

When he is grown great, he is bound to make war upon nature, to preserve himself; to unrobe beasts to cloth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, he must use a kind of Tyranny upon creatures, if he will free himself from the fury of the elements, and he hath so little credit in his dominions, that as he must tear up the earth for food, so must he strip beasts to cloth himself.</p>

               <p>Mans death is more honourable than his birth; they glory in murder though it be unjust, and are ashamed of marriage, though it be lawfull.

But not to engage my self in seeking out the cause of so strange a disorder, which seem to countenance murther, and to place mans glory in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of his like, 'twill suffice to know that shame is the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <note n="n" place="margin">Libido in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusionis causa. <hi>Aug. 22. de Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit. cap.</hi> 17.</note> sin, and that nakednesse <note n="o" place="margin">Cognoverunt quia nudi erant nudati scilicet ea gratia, qua fiebat ut nudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas corporis, nulla eos lege peccati menti eorum repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nante confunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret. <hi>Aug. 14. de Civit. cap.</hi> 17.</note> was banished from off the earth, together with innocence.

Though this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morse was not sufficient to obtein pardon for hisoffence, 'twas sharp enough to cause shame in him; and that of reason which remained in him, was sufficient to make him blush.

was mixt with grace, and God who would not for ever undo him, sent him this shame to reduce him to his duty: 'twas an evidence that though his nature was <note n="r" place="margin">Nullum quip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe vitium ita contra naturam est, ut naturae deleat etiam extrema vesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia. <hi>Aug. 19 de civit. cap.</hi> 12.</note> corrupted, yet it was totally destroyed; and that sin which had tyrannized over him; had not been able to efface all the principles which he had received from his Sovereign: but he neglecting the use thereof, and those who came of him not improving this remainder of innocency, it grew weaker with time, and the more faulty they grew, the more shamelesse they grew.</p>
               <p>They lost as well the shame of sin as the knowledge of God, they lost the onely advantage which remained to them in their mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, and nature growing obdurate, they did no longer lament their past happinesse, nor were they ashamed for their present misery. This is that which makes the <hi>Barbarians</hi> not blush at their nakednes, which makes them glory in their shame, which makes them esteem that naturall, <note n="s" place="margin">Evulgatus pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor non societa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem libidinis <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

they were inconsiderate in building so great Palaces for a man, who during his life, and after death takes up but seven foot of earth, they grew weary of so great buildings, they lost themselves in these Labyrinthes, and knowing that they could fill but one chamber, they acknowledged it was unjustly done to build so prodigious a number of rooms, <note n="e" place="margin">Quid prosunt multa cubicula? in uno jacetis non est vestrum ubicumque non estis. <hi>Senec.

               <p>Vain glory reaped no advantage by the faults pleasure committed, but looking upon the works thereof onely as upon beginnings, she undertook whatsoever seemed to be impossible, and her raising of <hi>Colossuses</hi> and <hi>Pyramides</hi> was onely to purchase fame: she thought that of all mans works there was none more withstood the injuries of time, then those huge heaps of stone and rocks; she esteemed victories, odious, battles, bloudy; and thought that Triumphs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired Historians and Poets, to make them be known: she knew that Children were not immortall, that kingdomes had their peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ods as well as families; and that the vertues of Princes were aswell buried in oblivion, as their vices: she was perswaded nothing was of so long continuance as buildings, that the vast greatnesse thereof, rendered their authors memorable to posterity, and that the works of so many hands and so many years, could not perish but together with the world. Upon this foolish belief, Kings caused <hi>Colossuses</hi> to be built of so prodigious a height, that ships passed between their legs with their Masts up and Sails displayed: they built <hi>Pyramides,</hi> the foundations whereof descended even unto hell, and their tops were lost in the clouds: they tired their subjects to content their am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition; they threw all the revenues of their kingdomes into the bowels of the earth, to purchase reputation; they engraved their names in brasse, they hung their arms round about the wals of towns, and because marble is more solid then paper, they thought that that these monuments of vain glory would last longer then the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of Orators or Philosophers.</p>

So strange an accident put an end to so great a work, and parted those by force who out of vain glory had undertaken it, the people that understood one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther retired into the same countreys; that which had divided them from others, united them together, and they imagined that 'twas the will of heaven, they should live under the same climate, since it had given them the same language.</p>
               <p>Men were not made the wiser by this memorable example; there were some, who joyning industry to vain glory endevoured to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the works of God, and to make in this lower world an Epitome of the Universe. This was a more refined pride, and seemed more

praise-worthy then the other since 'twas more ingenious: for Princes who built Tombs or Palaces had no hand in the work more then the bare desire; the Architectours conceived the design, the earth fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished the materials, the people were at the expense, and the han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dycrafts men contributed their labour: thus was the glory divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and those bare away the most, who certeinly deserved the least.</p>
               <p>But when industry joyned with vain glory, honour was no more divided; he who laid the project employed no other hands, then his own to effect the work. Thus did ingenious <hi>Archimedes</hi> enclose whole Nature <note n="h" place="margin">Aemula Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turae parva re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perta manus.</note> in a vessel of Chrystall; he observed all the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the heavens in a brittle Globe, and if he could not infuse in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences into the stars which he there engraved, he gave them at least light and beauty: whosoever was in the midst of this in-animated Sphere saw the Sun arise above his head, and the stars set under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath his feet; this transparent globe did at one and the same time shew all the secrets of Nature, and looking upwards or downwards one might there observe all the rarities of both the Hemispheres. A certein Poet, admiring the excellency of this work, <note n="i" place="margin">Luditur &amp; fragili noster in orbe labor.</note> thought he could cause Jealousie in his <hi>Iupiter,</hi> and in this belief made it be told him in his language, that the hand of a man had equal'd Gods hand: and that if it had as much strength as it had compendious adresse, it might have formed a second Uuiverse,</p>
               <p>But notwithstanding what the Poets say, this Master-piece of workmanship did not survive it's author, the same age saw the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and end thereof, the ransacking of a Town put a period to this little world, when <hi>Siracusa</hi> was taken by the <hi>Romanes, Archimedes</hi> was there slain, and his work destroyed. Those proud <hi>Mausolaea</hi> which promised immortality to their builders, are reduced to ashes as well as the bodies which they did inclose, we do not know the places where their foundations were laid, and of all the marble and porphiry which went to their composure, nothing but smoak and dust remains, of all the stately buildings which vanity hath produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, none but the <hi>Pyramides</hi> of <hi>Egypt</hi> have triumphed over time.

This exercise is a kind of Traffique: 'tis a generall usury wherein every one glories; 'tis their clearest in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comb, who can joyn sleight of hand to good fortune, and who can lead fortune as they list. They are lesse egg'd on by pleasure, then by profit; and if they will acknowledge their owne weaknesse, they must confesse, that those who are most liberall, are avaritious at play.</p>
               <p>Anger governs there yet more absolutely then doth avarice; a man cannot have ill luck without some commotion, <note n="z" place="margin">Si qui ale<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

forth blasphemies against heaven. Ambition takes her place between avarice and anger; for though play makes all men equall, though the freedom of play forbids ceremony, though it be lawfull in play for every man to defend his own liberty, and that therein the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant may argue with his Master, yet vain-glory hath a share there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; men think winning an advantage, and that he that wins is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more dexterous, or more fortunate; and as if fortune ought to be more just in play, than in battels, men complain that she fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours the weakest, or the worst side.</p>
               <p>In fine, sorrow succeeds all other passions in this exercise, for if the losse be great, 'tis always accompanied with sorrow.

The second disorder of play, is, that it alienates men from their duty, and hinders them from doing what they ought, or from attending their affairs. All world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things are so linkt together as an evill seldome comes alone; one mis-fortune always produceth another, and it is almost impossible, that a malady doth not oft-times become a contagion.

Dearths cause the plague; for when necessity makes all things food, and that without considering what is good, or what is bad, men fall to whatsoever they meet withall; mens temper must be corrupted, and the body which is nourished with unwholesome food, must needs gather ill humours.

Particular families being little States, and Oeconomy being the picture of policy, one disorder never happens there alone; the Masters fault is always followed by the confusion of all the Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiques. Excesse in gaming is an infallible proofe of this truth, for those who passionately love this pastime, give over the thought of businesse, neglect the government of their house, lose all their

relations of Father, Master, or husband, and by one and the same fault, injure their children, wives, and servants. They lose all they have, in a short time, they morgage their lands, contract debts, and are constrained to keep out of company because they cannot appear abroad in their former gallantry. If the wives will not shut them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves up with their husbands, they must make friends, and must in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage their conscience, and betray their honour to continue their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary expence and porte.</p>

That gaming is fortunate in producingthese two effects, and that it doth so powerfully possesse those who practise it, that they have no use of their tongue to talk idlely or deprave, nor yet of their ears, to listen to such things.

This passion is entertained by the presence of such objects as do arise, she expresseth her self by looks and sighs, she furnisheth Lovers with a thousand ways to seduce those who will listen to them, growing learned in so good a school, they quit their losses, and oft-time of servants become Masters. But if all these sufficient reasons cannot disabuse those women who love play, and if they think it be a buckler for their chastity, we wil give them leave to play, provided they will give us leave to believe that this exercise is a cure for their incontinency, that the use thereof is permitted them onely to free them from love, and that knowing their frailty, they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed this pastime to secure their reputation, which would be in hazard of shipwrack, if they should be idle or solitary.</p>

                  </note> always waits for our offences before he punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them; and though his mercies may through his favour fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run our services, his justice doth never through punishments pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vene our sins. What likelihood was there to lodge an innocent person in an infected house? to make the seasons irregular which did measure a life not yet troubled by passions, and to give mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall influences to constellations, which were to enlighten immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall man? what reason have we to believe that man not being guilty the creature should rebell against him, and that the Elements should not be at peace in a body which was perfectly assubjected to the soul. I know very well that they reply, that originall righteousnesse, did free man from these disorders, and that serving him in stead of a buckler of defence, his body was thereby miraculously preserved from being burnt in the midst of of Summer, or frozen in the midst of Winter. But say he should have no feeling of these irregularities, he would yet have seen them, and his eyes would have suffered pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment in beholding an unpleasing object. What pleasure could he have taken in seeing a sun, the heat whereof did scorch the grasse, and cause the flowers to fade, to which it had given birth. What de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light should he have tasted in feeling the earth-quake under his feet, or to hear the thunder roar over his head? what contentment would he have found amidst boisterous windes, and storms at sea? should he not have had some reason of complaint, if he should have

               <p>GOd is so jealous of his own honour, and so carefull of our salvation, as foreseeing that the beauty of the creature might make us Idolaters, he hath left some faults in them, which teach us, that they deserve not to have altars erected to them, and the most illustrious being the most dangerous, since their beauty which makes us admire them, might make us likewise reverence them, he hath been pleased to abase them amidst their greatnesse, and to reduce them to a condition, wherein their weaknesse as well as their power doth appear.</p>
               <p>To say truth, that beautifull constellation, to whose heat Nature owes her fertility, hath defaults which make it appear, that his glory is but borrowed, and that his Lustre which procures him so many Idolaters, is but an obscurity before God.

the Sun had warmed it, and that Nature had all her principall ornaments before the Sun had received light; the third day was destined for the bearth of Trees; one word made the earth fruitfull; this mother which requires time to bring her works to perfection, did in a moment thrust out Oaks and Fir-trees; <note n="m" place="margin">Et ait ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The fourth day was reserved for the Suns birth; the Father of Trees, and Flowers, was born after his children; he who doth preserve them, did not produce them, and he who gives them life, did not give them birth; he had the care to bring them up, but not the glory to place them in the world; he had order to end a work, which God himselfe had begun.</p>

The world was three days old when this incomparable constellation had his birth; that which holds of his Empire had received it's perfection, and this visible God made it appear in his birth, that he did nothing which Nature could not have done without him: as if all these pre-cautions were not sufficient to stifle idolatry, God would have the Sun to draw his Name from servitude, and that that language which doth so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound in mysteries, <note n="o" place="margin">Idem vocabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum apud <hi>Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braeos</hi> significat servum &amp; so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem. <hi>Schemes.</hi>

We learnt from thence, that though he were the originall of light, he was not the Authour of Nature: that though he had heat enough to warm her, he had not power e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to preserve her; that though he were the King of Constel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, he was a slave to man; that his perpetuall motion was a mark of his servitude, that the difference of seasons was a token of his weaknesse, and that his Eclipses did prove that he somtimes lost his light. With what astonishment was the world struck, when it saw the Sun grow pale amidst his careers? what did men think when they saw a constellation which was in all things inferiour to the Sun, should obfuscate his beauties, should over-shadow him, that violating all the laws of Nature, it should put the Sun in shade, and make the night to reign in day time.</p>

               <p>I know very well that lovers indevour to throw of this yoke, that they strive to free themselves from this Tyranny, and that being weary of obeying, they fain would command their turn about, but all they can do is to no purpose, and the unalterable laws of love, force them fairly to submit to those subjects which are Masters of their liberty. The ambitious man would fain be the Sovereign of honour, but let him do what he can, he still remains the slave there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and whilst he leads on Troops and commands Armies, he is shamefully enforced to obey ambition which tyrannizeth over him.

               <p>This is the cause why he will not acknowledge any thing to be amisse in what he loves, why he doth admire the perfections there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and why he doth mingle his vices and vertues together: for to give right judgment of any thing a superiority is required in the judgment giver. Some advantage must be had over that whose weaknesses would be known, and lovers being slaves to those they love, their blindnesse lasts as long as doth their slavery; by a no lesse necessary then unfortunate consequence, they assume the qualities of that object which causeth their love, they transform themselves into what they love, and change nature as well as condition: but that which is most unjust in this change is, that these wretched crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures take unto themselves the worst of the qualities of what they love, and cannot take the best; and having a capability of becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming easily imperfect, they can never become accomplisht: a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed man loseth not his deformity, though he love an exquisite

Ambitious men become as vain as the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour which they idolatrize; greedy men are no lesse obdurate, then is the metall which they adore, and the lascivious are as base as is the pleasure which they so much cherish.

               <p>Learning upon the same principle, they thought that Earth-quakes and Deluges were onely accidents which found their causes in nature, and which were as ordinary to the earth, as heats and colds to those that are sick, <note n="c" place="margin">Suas ista cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sas habent, net ex imperio sae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viunt, sed ex quibusdam vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiis, ut corpora nostra turban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar. <hi>Senec.

Fire descends to assist nature, when she is set upon; water mounts aloft to supply the place of vacuum which is the common enemy to all elements, the earth opens her bowels and loosens her self from her foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to suppresse the disorders which sin hath caused in the world; but it is not to be comprehended how all the parts of the world should conspire natures ruine, nor by what secret veins the sea could issue forth so much water as could drown her: the sea even when incensed useth violence upon her self not to overflow the earth; <note n="q" place="margin">Usque huc venies &amp; non procedes am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plius &amp; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Mother. Though I confesse that divine mercy doth oft-times turn our punishments into favours, and that it may aswell turn the plague to a remedy, as death to a sacrifice, yet I look upon it as one of the strangest Punishments ordained by divine justice to punish men withall.</p>
               <p>I must in reason confesse that it is a generall corruption of nature, that it assails all the parts thereof, and that it disperseth venom into all the elements to cause death to the sinfull; it infecteth the air which we draw in with our breath, it gets into our bowels with the meat which we eat, it makes the earth barren by it's bad influences and passing from men to beasts, commits as much havock in the fields as in towns: this malady surpasseth the Physicians skill, it laughs at all antidotes, it is not to be shun'd but by flight, and it is sometimes so universall as men meet with it in the very places which they have chosen for their Sanctuary. Wee bear the seed thereof a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with us, which it in time hatches forth, and shews it self as fire doth when we think it is extinguisht.</p>
               <p>It is the most perverse and least respectful punishment of all those that befall sinfull man, for 'tis a rebell to all remedies, it turns anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotes into venome, and when it doth reign absolutely any where, it is fed with whatsoever is given to allay it, it assails Monarchs amidst their armies, the Lawrels which fence their heads from Thunder, cannot keep them from the contagion thereof, and that Sanctity which receives respect from other diseases cannot stop it's progresse. The most <hi>August</hi> and holiest of all our Kings died of this disease in <hi>Africa,</hi> his valour and his piety which had freed him out of prison, could not deliver him from his sicknesse, but after having triumphed over vice and infidelity, a period was put to all his conquests by a contagious death.</p>
               <p>The holiest of all the Kings of <hi>Iudah,</hi> knowing that heaven was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended at him, &amp; that the anger thereof was not to be appeased but by a general satisfaction, chose the plague before either war, or famin, out of a beliefe that this scourge might aswell light on him as on the meanest of his subjects. In effect, it spares no man, neither youth nor age can allay the rigour, nor stop the progresse thereof, it mows down more souldiers then war doth, it cuts off more Commanders then the sword, it boasts of ending the differences between Kings, and of making them make peace by taking from them the means of
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:61993:207"/>
making war. There have been some so contagious plagues, as have dispeopled the greatest part of the world, the seas did not stop their Conquests, and this vast element which serves for a stop to the ambition of Conquerours, could not dissipate the fury thereof; the winds served them for post-horses, and they crost the seas to carry infection into the utmost parts of the world without either oares or fails: the number of the dead was so great as the <note n="l" place="margin">Dcest terra tumulis, jam ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gos sylvae ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant, non vota, non arsulla cor reptos levant, cadunt meden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes. <hi>Senec. in Oedip.</hi>
                  </note> earth was not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to cover them, nor yet the forrests to bury them, Physicians died together with the sick; Children dropt down after their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and lost their lives in doing them their last duties. A man need onely to consider the horrour of this malady to acknowledge that it is one of the punishments of sin: during the time of innocence, the air was not corrupted, the earth brought forth no fruits which could breed bad humours, death did not reign where there was no guilty persons: Heaven, which breeds contagion by it's mortall influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, did not punish those which it had not as yet <note n="m" place="margin">Scilicet coeli reus sperare po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terat sceleribus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantis dari reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num salubre, fecimus coelum nocens <hi>Senec. in Oedipose.</hi>

               <p>One may say that the same thing which causeth contagion on the land, causeth tempests at sea, that it conspires together with sin to undo man, that it unpeoples the earth to people hell, and that it holds Intelligence with the winds to sink ships. Some Philosophers have been of opinion that the sea did not belong to the Empire of man, that this element was reserved for fishes, as the air for birds, that it was an usurpation to sail thereon, to cut through the waves thereof to discover it's champians, and to penetrate the depths there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, that Nature which punisheth all injustice had raised up storms, and formed rocks to revenge his Tyranny; but certainly reason binds us to believe that there was nothing in the world which was not put under <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The sea is so fruitfull herein as the most of her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:61993:208"/>
are monstruous, every fish is an enemy to man, they are not to be tamed by art, and violence bereaves them rather of their life then of their fury. It seems that being by divine Justice imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed against men in the deluge, they retain yet some remembrance of that first imployment, and that they think to revenge God as oft as they punish us: they by their strength overturn great ships, they leap into lesser vessels to assail us, they make storms in the midst of calms, &amp; being living rocks do oft-times cause the skilfullest Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners run shipwrack.</p>
               <p>This great danger is accompanied by the like of Tempests, which seem to enrage the Sea onely that she may drown the Land, or bury mankind in her waves. This disorder is good for nothing but to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do us; prophane Philosophy findes no other cause for it; the more it considers the strange effects thereof, the more is it obliged to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore Gods Justice, and to condemne mans sin. <note n="o" place="margin">Hinc procellae &amp; turbines hinc plurima morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium mala &amp; rerum naturae pugna secum. <hi>Plin. lib. 2. c. 38</hi>

The plague it selfe which violating all the Laws of Nature, sweeps away the Son together with the Father, and buries in the same grave the Physician and the Patient, doth oft-times by the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vock which it makes, prevent the cruelty of war, and kils men to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them from committing parricide; for when it sees the earth groan underneath the burthen of her children, that she can no longer nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish those which she hath brought forth, that the scarcity of victuals makes people take up armes, and prepare for war to free themselves from famine; it dispeoples Towns, dis-burthens the fields, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaves men of their lives, only to preserve their innocence; but Tempests are only fit to punish either our avarice, or our ambition; the Seas rage is only usefull to make us know our offences, the deeps which open themselves beneath ships, the mountains of water which raise themselves above the Sailes, the lightnings which min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle themselves amongst the waves, and threaten us at the same time both which being drown'd and burnt, are formed by the hand of Nature only to make us die with more of pomp, and more of horrour.</p>

from our mis-fortunes, perswade themselves that Nature is not cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, and account her disorders advantages; they term death a law more necessary then rigorous; they call sicknesse the souls salve, the tryall of vertue, and the exercise of patience; they call poverty a dis-ingagement from uselesse things, a nearer cut to vertue, a help to argue with more freedom, they term the persecution of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments an innocent war which causeth the worlds peace, a hatred which conduceth to a perfect friendship, or an excellent picture of musick, whose harmony is composed of the differences of voices, and contrariety of tones.</p>
               <p>By the same reason they justifie the disorders of nature, and call Monsters irregularities which heighten her other works; they plead in the behalf of poysons, and make them passe for remedies, whose use we are yet ignorant of.

               <p>'Tis true, that it's ruine will be usefull to it, and that it will reap advantage by it's losse; for all Gods punishments are favours, he puts obligations upon those that he punisheth, his goodnesse turns their sufferings into salves; and to be strucken by the hand of God, brings both honour and advantage with it. Death, which destroys the body, prepares it for the resurrection; it changeth it's grave into a cradle, and as the corruption of corn is the cause of it's re-assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming life; we may say that the putrefaction of the body is in some sort the seed of it's mortality.
