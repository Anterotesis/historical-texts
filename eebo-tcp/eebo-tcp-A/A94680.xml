         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

entered into various engagements before God and the World, for to endeavour the reſtoring of this Nation unto her
juſt Freedome, Rights and Happineſſe.</p>
            <p>And whereas your Petitioners looking into the true ſtate of things doe finde, That notwithſtanding any thing
whatſoever, that hath been, as yet, done, or attempted by this or any precedent Parliament, in the behalfe of this
Nation: and after ſo much Engliſh bloud ſpilt under that pretence; The Nation is ſtill ſuffered to remaine (as it hath
done almoſt theſe ſix hundred yeares) in Captivity to the Right, Title, Exerciſe, and diſgracefull Badges of the <hi>Normane</hi> (pretended)
Conqueſt over us, as is manifeſt by the tenour of that Title by which (with the conſenting ſufferage of our Parliaments, Laws,
and Lawyers, as yet un-repeal'd) the Crown of <hi>England</hi> is ſtill enjoyed, and by a great part both of the matter and forme of thoſe
Laws, by which we are ſtill governed.</p>
            <p>Now foraſmuch as untill the Bands of this our Nationall Captivity be diſſolved, all elſe that is done or endeavoured, (how gloriouſly
ſo ever pretending) being all terminated in the abatement of the Royall Prerogative, and is 1 not onely of lower concernment, as to the
ſervice of this Nation, but 2 alſo very irregular and inſufficient for atteining the Ends propoſed; the firſt, for that is undeniably leſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
unto Honour and true Freedom in a Nation, for to be under arbitrary Government, legitimately inſtituted (as were the <hi>Jews</hi> under
their anointed Kings, and the <hi>Romans</hi> under their <hi>Dictators</hi>) then under the moſt moderated Sovereignty that ſprings from and is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
of a Conqueſt; the latter, for that while this Kingdom (or the relation betwixt our Kings and People) continues grounded
on the Conqueſt; the Sovereignty cannot legally nor (conſequently) validly be ſo moderated, but that the Supreame Laws will be
ſtill (not<note n="a" place="margin">In all pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Acts and Writings emit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in this Kingdom ſince the (pretended) Conqueſt, the Honour of the King hath bin conſtantly ſet before the Good of the People, where e're they are conjoyn'd.</note> 
               <hi>Salus Populi,</hi> as hath been lately, and not till lately, fondly talked in this Kingdom, but) the Honour and Will of the Prince,
as ſufficiently appears (to omit other Teſtimonies) from the fate &amp; iſſue of ſome Acts of Parliament in K. <hi>Edward</hi> the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> time, which<note n="b" place="margin">See Maſter <hi>Pryns</hi> Sov. Pow. part. 2. p. 38. &amp; 39. &amp; the Book of Stat.</note> fell
to the ground, and were nullified by the Kings bare Authority joyned with the conſent of the Lords, for being prejudiciall to the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
Honour and Prerogative, as which are and will be the Fundamentall and Supream Law in this Kingdom, while it continues ſo groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
as aboveſaid. And for as much as the ſaid Title of Conqueſt and Depravation of our Laws, are not onely Deſtructive
(while they continue in force over us) to the Honour, Freedom, and Happineſſe of our Nation, but alſo contrary to the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall
Conſtitution of this Kingdom, as being uſurpantly and perfidiouſly introduced; for that (according to the unanimous teſtimony
of Records) the <hi>Normane</hi> Duke was by this Nation admitted to the Crown, in reſpect of his Claim by Saint <hi>Edward's</hi>
               <note n="c" place="margin">If any object (as many doe) that the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Right &amp; Title muſt be either by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, or none at all, for that the Title of Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacy was inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, It is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that the Legacy of the deceaſed King joyned with the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons Admiſsion (which follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) was equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent to an Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſo ſufficient to regulate &amp; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſe the Crown, as no rationall man can deny.</note> Legacy joyn'd
with his Victory over his Competitor <hi>Harold,</hi> and upon his Oath to preſerve our Laws and Liberties, and not otherwiſe; Inſomuch that
the Title of <hi>England's</hi> Conquerour may as juſtly be affixed to the Names of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth, and <hi>Henry</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
(who all made good their claimes by Victories over their Competitors) as to the name of the ſaid Duke.</p>
            <p>And for that alſo theſe Abuſes are not onely thus prejudiciall and injurious to our Nation, but alſo very Derogatory to the Honour of
our Kings and to their Intereſt in the Peoples affections, as founding their Right and Rule on an uſurpant originall, and on the Ruines of
the Honour and Freedom of this Nation, and thereby caſting the ſeeds of irreconciliable hatred betwixt them; Inſomuch, that there is
none in this Kingdom can ſtand up in the maintenance of theſe Injuries, without declaring themſelves open Enemies, and the moſt fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitious
Traitors both to their King and Countrey, that ever were.</p>
            <p>And for as much as it hath now pleaſed Almighty God to put that power and opportunity into your hands for the Redreſſe of theſe
Evils, which was never heretofore afforded to your Predeceſſors, and that ye are now upon a Treaty with his <hi>MAJESTY,</hi> for new
forming the Fabrick of this State.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>May it therefore pleaſe this Honourable Houſe, now at length (before 'tis too late) to take ſuch
order, That our Kings may no longer reign over us by the Right or Pretence of Conqueſt, thereby
trampling under foot our chiefe Rights and Happineſſe, But that the Title of the Normane Bloud
unto the Crown of</hi> England, <hi>may be grounded (as of right it ought to be) on the Legacie of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>.</hi> Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, 
<hi>joyned with the Nations Admiſſion granted (and to be ſtill granted) upon the Coronation Oath
taken, and not otherwiſe: And that the Right and Title of the ſaid (pretended) Conqueſt, being thus
aboliſhed out of this Kingdom, the diſgracefull and needleſſe Badges thereof ſtill remaining among us,
(particularly in the matter and language of our Laws) may, in convenient time, be likewiſe redreſt,
whereby the Engliſh Nation may now at length (after ſo many ages unjuſt ſufferance) be reſtored from
out of the Quality, Title, and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>eſture, of a Captive, under a forreign bloud, unto her juſt Honour,
Freedome, and Happineſſe, and that ſo (through your worthy endeavours, in thus putting an end to
your Countries long Bondage) there may be laid amongst us a reall and laſting Foundation of glory to
God on high, of Peace in this Kingdom, and of good will betwixt Prince and People, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
is altogether impoſſihle to be done.</hi>
