         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe Treaty is carried on violently, &amp; many jealouſies poſſeſs the honeſt party, who are as active as ſcrutinous, knowing a perſonall Treaty was never yet deſired with out ſome deſigne to cut their throats; divine providence, with Gods wonted goodneſſe to his people diſcovers a helliſh Plot in the City, to Maſſacre all honeſt Members in Parliament, and Inhabitants in City and Suburbs, for which Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions were granted from his Sacred Highneſſe the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> to Citizens and others, who in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of the Covenant with their deare Brethren of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and their zeale to the Royall Cauſe of his Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Majeſty, make large ſubcriptions for buying Armes,

            <p>A Committee was this day appointed to joyne with the Miltia in examining and diſcovering this deſigne, with power to ſend for parties, witneſſes, &amp;c. ſeize horſes armes, and Ammunition, and ſecure ſuch perſons as they ſhall think fit. They conſider of their Lordſhips Votes upon the buſineſſe of the Treaty, and make ſome additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and alterations therein: Agree to the repealing of foure Votes for no further application to the King. To the Vote for perſons to attend him during the Treaty, the Commons add a proviſion, That they be not perſons ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted againſt under reſtraint, or in actuall Warr by Sea or Land, nor ſo many as may cauſe ſuſpition: To that, for his Majeſty to be in the ſame freedom as at Hampton Court, Concurred. To that for Domeſtick ſervants to attend him, agreed to, ſo that they be not in any of the former limitations.</p>
            <p>His Highneſſ the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> hath ſent for a Dr. and Apothecary from London to wait ſpedily upon him: They acquaint the Speaker with the Princes Command, the occaſion thereof, and their deſires to the Houſe in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation thereuto.

            <p>The Princes Agent was ſeen this day in the Exchange, London, and being friendly invited to a Glaſſe of Wine, a ſquadron of Major Gen. <hi>Skippons</hi> horſe in the interim ſecured him, upon ſearch finde the Clavis of the Princes Characters, Commiſſions from the Prince to Citizens, and ſeverall particulars of Armes in relation to the grand Deſigne of the City: The priſoner and two Troopers are Coched, a ſquadron of horſe-guard them down to Derby houſ who diſpoſe of the Agent into ſafe Cuſtody, &amp; return thanks to the Troopers, who reſt not here, but ſcout round, and thorow the City this night, and Sunday like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, their activiandy gallantry makes them terrible, and more diſpicable, the Enemy calling them <hi>Fairfax</hi> Baſtards.
