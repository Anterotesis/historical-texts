            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>A poore Man going to a wood,</l>
               <l>Within the Snow an Adder found:</l>
               <l>When, wishing how to doe it good,</l>
               <l>Did take it vp, from off the ground:</l>
               <l>And fearing of no future harme,</l>
               <l>Did in his bosome keepe it warme.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <pb facs="tcp:16676:5"/>
               <l>But comming home vnto the fire,</l>
               <l>No sooner hee had loosde his Coate:</l>
               <l>But, to requite his kinde desire,</l>
               <l>The Adder bit him by the throate:</l>
               <l>Now whereto doth this tale alude?</l>
               <l>But onely to Ingratitude:</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>There was a Lyon as I reade,</l>
               <l>Who had a Thorne got in his foote:</l>
               <l>Which in his trauaile fore did bleede,</l>
               <l>While to his hart the payne did shoote:</l>
               <l>With which, vnto his Denne hee came,</l>
               <l>And fell to licking of the same.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>When, as hee stoode hee spied a Man,</l>
               <l>VVho had beene thether fled for feare:</l>
               <l>And in his hart, with griefe beegan,</l>
               <l>To mourne his haplesse beeing there:</l>
               <l>Yet, seeing how the Lyon stoode,</l>
               <l>Aduentured to doe him good.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And feeling softly where it stucke,</l>
               <l>So cunningly did beate about:</l>
               <l>As with his mouth first fell to sucke,</l>
               <l>Then, with his Teeth, did get it out:</l>
               <l>And after did such help apply,</l>
               <l>That hee was eased by and by.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <pb facs="tcp:16676:6"/>
               <l>And when the Lyon felt such ease,</l>
               <l>Hee reacht him out a Princely Pawe:</l>
               <l>As who should say to such as please,</l>
               <l>I carry comfort in my Clawe:</l>
               <l>And to requite his kindnesse then,</l>
               <l>Hee led him foorth out of his Den.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And brought him through a wildernesse,</l>
               <l>Into a high way, neere a towne:</l>
               <l>When in a Princely gentlenesse,</l>
               <l>Before his face, hee sat him downe:</l>
               <l>And with his Pawe as Poets tell,</l>
               <l>Did giue a Kingly kinde farewell.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Now shortly after it befell,</l>
               <l>This Lyon was by hunters caught:</l>
               <l>And as the story seemes to tell,</l>
               <l>Vnto an Emperour was brought:</l>
               <l>And with great Ioy and Iolitie,</l>
               <l>Presented to his Maiestie.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>VVhich Lyon kept, as others are,</l>
               <l>That so are caught, and so are brought:</l>
               <l>To seede vpon such hungry fare,</l>
               <l>As, tamnesse had his stomacke taught:</l>
               <l>Did liue such Trayterous harts to teare:</l>
               <l>As to such death condempned were.</l>

               <l>Whose Eie had neuer Treason seene,</l>
               <l>Nor Spirit such a thought had found:</l>
               <l>Iniuriously was apprehended,</l>
               <l>And vnto such a death condempned.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Who beeing brought vnto the Den,</l>
               <l>Whereas the Lyon fiercely stood:</l>
               <l>To teare in peeces, those ill men,</l>
               <l>That fed him with their poisoned blood:</l>
               <l>Before his face did kindelie stand,</l>
               <l>And pawde and lickt him on the hand.</l>
            </lg>

               <l>The Lyon thus the Man entreate:</l>
               <l>Did wonder what the cause should bee,</l>
               <l>His loue to him should bee so great:</l>
               <l>And to the Emperour did tell,</l>

               <l>Did promise him, the cause to show,</l>
