            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  </gap>garet Oſgood,</hi> for the horrid and bloody Murther of her Husband, commited in St <hi>Olives</hi> Pariſh in the Burrough of <hi>Southwark</hi> the 21th of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:35331:2"/>
               <hi>July</hi> laſt. The defence ſhe made was thus, That by his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancy he had brought her to Diſtraction, and ſo deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ſhe was under that ſence, that ſhe had ſeveral times at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted her own en<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> by violence and was not capable of her actions when ſhe did commit that horrid Murther on him; but her confeſſion and the Evidence againſt her contradicting that Apology ſhe was brought in Guilty of Treaſon and Murther.</p>
            <p>The next was one <hi>John Aſhlock,</hi> for ſtealing a Watch and three pieces of Gold, a Meddal and other things from his Maſter who lives at <hi>Stoake</hi> near <hi>Guilford,</hi> and by a favourable proſecution found not guilty.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Then <hi>Richard Wilſon</hi> took his Trial for a Burglary, he was committed in <hi>February</hi> laſt, three Witneſſes were poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive that the <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d of <hi>February</hi> laſt, he had broke into the Houſe of one <hi>Turner</hi> in <hi>Bandy-legg-walk</hi> in the Park in <hi>Southwark,</hi> and carried thereout ſeveral ſuits of Apparel which were found upon him for which he ſtands Convicted.</p>
            <p>Four or Five former Convicted Criminals were brought to the Bar, and produced the Kings Pardon for all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Crimes.</p>
            <p>The next was <hi>Edw. Bowmar,</hi> charged for the killing one <hi>Collins</hi> in <hi>Kent-ſtreet January</hi> laſt, The Evidence againſt the Priſoner was, that a Quarrel happening betwixt him and the party deceaſed, the Priſoner took up Stones and Coles, which he did throw at the party deceaſed, one of which having hit him on the Head, did mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally wound him and was the occaſion of his Death; the Prisoner did not deny the fact, and was brought in guilty of Chance-medley.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>James Steward,</hi> and <hi>Ann James,</hi> were Arraigned for a Fellony, The proof againſt them was, that on the 21th of <hi>Auguſt</hi> laſt, one <hi>Andrew Brittle</hi> living in <hi>Bermond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey,</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:35331:2"/>
leaving his Dore faſt locked when he went out, did in ſhort time return, and found the ſame open and ſeveral Clothes to the vallue of 20 ſhillings and five ſhillings in money ſtollen thereout, and making enquiry of the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, the Priſoners were deſcribed to him, and upon purſuit about nine days after did apprehend them, and found ſome of the Goods that were ſtolen upon them. Their defence was, that they being Waſher women, the Linnen he Challeng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, was brought them to be waſhed, but failing, in produce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Parties that brought it, they were found Guilty.</p>
            <p>The next were the ſaid <hi>Ann James, Jane Steward,</hi> together with one <hi>Edward Turner,</hi> who on the firſt of <hi>September</hi> laſt, were charged upon ſuſpicion to have broke into the dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Houſe of one <hi>Thomas Stainton</hi> in <hi>Barnaby</hi>-Street, and ſtealing thence ſeveral wearing Apparel, and Linnen to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable vallue. The proof was thus, that the ſame day the ſaid <hi>Edward Turner</hi> had broke into the Houſe of one <hi>John Moulſworth,</hi> for which he was alſo Indicted, and Convicted, The Evidence being, that he was Actually taken in the Fact, he for his defence only offerred, that he had money due to him from one <hi>John Simons</hi> that lived there, and that this <hi>Simons</hi> told him, he then ſhould have it, if he would go with him home and ſtay there, till he had carried ſome Goods to the Pawn-brokers, to raiſe monies on, and going with him accordingly, the ſaid <hi>Simons</hi> left him in that Houſe where he was apprehended, but this being but only a pretence, and one ſilver Cup, of 30 ſhillings vallue, one Amber Necklace, and other things belonging to the ſaid <hi>Moulſworth,</hi> were found upon him, as alſo ſeveral Picklock-Keys, who with one of them, did open the Door of that houſe after locked and upon Evidence that all three were ſeen together at the ſaid <hi>Staintons</hi> Houſe, they were all Convicted for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and <hi>Turner</hi> alone for the latter Fellony.</p>
