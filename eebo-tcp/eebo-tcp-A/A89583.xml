            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <q>And from the dayes of<hi> John </hi>the Baptiſt untill now, the Kingdome of Heaven ſuffereth violence, and the violent take it by force.</q>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat you may the more cleerly underſtand the ſcope of our bleſſed Saviour in theſe words, be pleaſed to obſerve that in the beginning <note place="margin">The context opened.</note> of this Chapter, <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt had ſent two of his Diſciples upon a meſſage to Chriſt; not for his own information, but for the confirmation of his Diſciples, who were too much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:116111:5"/>
to himſelf, that they might be ſatisfied in receiving Chriſt to be (as he was) the promiſed Meſſiah, by ſeeing and hearing what he did and taught; as ſoon as theſe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples of <hi>Iohn</hi> were gone, Chriſt turnes to the multitude, that were about him, and from the 7. verſe of this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to the 16. verſe, doth make a notable diſcourſe wholly concerning <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt; and there are two parts of Chriſts ſpeech concerning <hi>Iohn;</hi> Firſt,</p>
            <p>A blaming of the levity, and inconſtancie of the people, in their reſpect towards <hi>Iohn,</hi> for they had magnified him ſo (not long before) that they were ready to have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him as their Meſſiah; but now <hi>Iohn</hi> was grown no body with them; this our Saviour doth bitterly taxe. And the argument whereby he reproves them lies in ſuch a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribution as this is, Either you were very fooliſh in magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying <hi>Iohn,</hi> when there was no ſuch worth in him, or you are extreame vaine and light in withdrawing your hearts from him, that was ſo worthy at firſt to be received: the firſt is not to be granted, therefore the ſecond muſt needs be true; what went you out into the Wilderneſſe to ſee? <hi>was it a Reed ſhaken with the wind?</hi> did you goe as children doe, to ſee rattles and toyes? no, but wee went to ſee and heare <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt; and what in him? <hi>a man cloathed in white raiment,</hi> alas, <hi>Iohn</hi> was no Courtier; no, we went to him as to a Prophet; <hi>I, ſo he was</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>and more then a Prophet,</hi> the greateſt Prophet that ever the world ſaw, and the greater is your fault in ſlighting of him.</p>
            <p>In this as in a glaſſe you may ſee the levity and inconſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of people who contemne him to day whom they admired yeſterday, and that doctrine which this day they eſteeme as a treaſure they by and by abominate, becauſe indeed <hi>Athenian-</hi>like they imbrace it not becauſe true, but
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:116111:5"/>
becauſe new: thus it hath been of old, and thus it is to this day, he who to day is lifted up is to morrow trodden down, who is now accounted cloquent is preſently eſteem'd a babe, rude or barbarous, and all from their ſickleneſſe, the Word and Miniſters are the ſame, but the people are changed, like ſick peoples palate, who long for that meat one day which they nauſeate the next day, or as children who delight in thoſe toyes one day which the next they throw out of the doores.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The ſecond part of Chriſts diſcourſe concerning <hi>Iohn</hi> is,</p>
            <p>A high commendation of <hi>Iohn,</hi> and of his Miniſtery,  from three notable arguments: Firſt,</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> That <hi>Iohn</hi> was the Prophet, that was foretold long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by two emminent Prophets, <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> &amp; <hi>Malachi,</hi> both of <note place="margin">Verſe 10. 14.</note> them ſhewing that the Lord would ſend his meſſenger be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his face, and (ſaith Chriſt) if you'l beleeve it, this is he. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The ſecond is taken from the eminencie of <hi>Iohns</hi> worke, hee did immediatly goe before Jeſus Chriſt, as a Noble <note place="margin">Verſe 11.</note> man that ſhould lead the Prince by the hand, and ſhew him to every one, <hi>This is he;</hi> he did not as the other Prophets hold him out in types and ſhadows, and ſpake of a Meſſiah that was to come a long time after, but as another <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtopher</hi> did carry Chriſt upon his ſhoulders, and held him out in his armes, that every one that came neer <hi>Iohn</hi> might ſee him pointed out to the <hi>Lambe of God, that took away the ſinnes of the world;</hi> and the clearer any Miniſtery is in the diſcovery of Chriſt, the more excellent it is; but yet that Chriſt might ſet the true bounds to the honour of <hi>Iohns</hi> Miniſtery, he adds that though of all the Prophets that ever were before him, there was none like him, yet the leaſt Miniſter after Chriſt ſhould have done his worke, the meaneſt Miniſter of the Goſpel had a more excellent Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery then <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt, becauſe the excellencie of a
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:116111:6"/>
