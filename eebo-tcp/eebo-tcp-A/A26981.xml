            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THis Paraphraſe, written for my own uſe, being publiſhed for yours, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to that end I owe you this account of it. A Friend long urging me to write a Paraphraſe on the <hi>Epiſtle</hi> to the <hi>Romans,</hi> as being hard to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> underſtood; when I had done that, I found ſo much profit by that At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, that it drew me to go on till I had finiſhed what I offer you. It was like almoſt all my other publick works, done by the unexpected conduct of Gods urgent Providence, not only without, but contrary to my former purpoſes. God hath bleſt his Church with many Mens excellent Commentaries on the Scriptures; and I never thought my ſelf fit to do it better than they have done: But that is beſt for ſome perſons and uſes which is not beſt to others. I long wiſh'd that ſome abler Man would furniſh vulgar Families with ſuch a brief expoſition, as might be fitted to the uſe of their daily courſe in reading the Scriptures and inſtructing their Houſholds. I found that many who have done it better than I can do, are too large and coſtly for this uſe: ſome (like <hi>De<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>date</hi>) very ſound, are unſatisfactorily brief; ſome have parcelled their Annotations into ſo numerous ſhreds, that Readers (ſpecially in a Family courſe) will not ſtay to ſearch and ſet them together, to make up the ſenſe. I like Dr. <hi>Hammends</hi> order beſt, but 1. I differ from him in ſo much of the matter; 2. and took his ſtile to be too lax; 3. and his Criticiſms not uſeful to the vulgar, 4. and his Volumn too big, and coſtly: And therefore I choſe more plainly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and yet more briefly and practically, by the way of Paraphraſe, to ſuit it to my intended end.</p>
            <p>But I muſt give the Readers notice, 1. That where I ſeem, but in few words to vary from the Text, thoſe words anſwer the large Criticiſms of divers expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, as the Learned may find by ſearching them and the <hi>Greek</hi>-Text; though I muſt not ſtay to give the reaſon of them as I go on. 2. That tho I have ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died plainneſs, yet brevity is unavoidably obſcure to unexerciſed perſons, who as Learners cannot underſtand things without many words. 3. That where the Evangeliſts oft repeat the ſame things, to avoid tediouſneſs, I repeat not the whole Expoſition; and yet thought not meet wholly to paſs it by. 4. That where the Text is plain of it ſelf, inſtead of an Expoſition, I fill up the ſpace by Doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, or Practical Obſervations, ſeeing Practice is the end of all, and to Learners, this part is of great neceſſity. 5. That where great Doctrinal Controverſies depend on the Expoſition of any Text, I have handled thoſe more largely than the reſt, and I hope with Pacificatory and Satisfactory Evidence.</p>

To which ſpecial end I alſo wrote my <hi>Poor Mans Family-book,</hi> and <hi>The Catechizing of Houſholders.</hi> And had I not done it in many Books ſo oft already, I ſhould here ſet my ſelf with greateſt Earneſtneſs to urge and intreat all Chriſtian Parents, to the more faithful Practice of Family Religion, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the wiſe and diligent Inſtruction and Education of their Children. Sure no good Chriſtians ſhould come behind the <hi>Jews,</hi> who had far leſs light and help that we have, who yet are twice Commanded by God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. and 11. [<hi>Hear O Iſrael, the Lord God is one Lord. Thou ſhall Love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy ſoul, and with all thy might. And theſe words which I command thee this day, ſhall be in thy heart: And thou ſhalt teach them diligently to thy Children, and ſhall talk of them when thou fitteſt in thy Houſe, and when thou walkeſt by the way, and when thou lyeſt down, and when thou riſeſt up: And thou ſhalt bind them for a ſign upon thy Hand, and they ſhall be as Frontlets between thine Eyes: And thou ſhalt write them on the Poſts of thy Houſe and on thy Gates.</hi>] Yet now many thouſand Families called Chriſtians, account this much Puritaniſm, and needleſs preciſeneſs; as if the Scripture, (even the Goſpel of Salvation) were only for the uſe of Prieſts, yea ſome that diſown the Papiſts reſtraint of the Laity-unli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed, from reading it tranſlated in a known Tongue, do worſe than Popiſhly refrain themſelves. And thoſe that in Baptiſm vowed to bring up their Children as Chriſtians in the knowledge of the Goſpel of Chriſt, perſidiouſly break that ſolemn vow, as they Hypocritically made it; and by ungodly negligence betray to Satan the Souls of their Children (and themſelves) which they devoted to God.</p>
            <p>Reader, I beg of you as from Chriſt, for his ſake, for your Souls ſake, for your Childrens ſake, for the ſake of Church and Kingdom, that you will conſciona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly and ſeriouſly ſet up Family-Religion, calling upon God, Singing his Praiſes, and inſtructing your Children and Servants in the Scripture and Catechiſm, and in a wiſe and diligent Education of Youth. Hear me, as if I beg'd it of you, with tears on my knees? Alas, what doth the World ſuffer by the neglect of this. It is out of ungodly Families that the World hath ungodly Rulers, ungodly Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, and a ſwarm of Serpentine Enemies of Holineſs and Peace, and their own Salvation. What Country groaneth not under the Confuſions, Miſeries and horrid Wickedneſs, which are all the Fruits of Family neglects, and the careleſs and ill Education of Youth. It is a work of great skill and conſtant care to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct and Educate your Children, and to keep them from tempting Company and ſnares. To cry out of dumb or unfaithful Miniſters, while you are worſe at home your ſelves, is but ſelf-condemnation: Are M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Can they do that for whole Pariſhes, which you will not do for for one Houſhold or your own Children. The firſt Charge and part is yours: If Families treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly neglect their part, and then look that all ſhould be done at the Church you may as wiſely ſend Boys to the Univerſities, before they are taught to Read or Write, in lower Schools. If there be any hope of the amendment of a Wicked,
<pb facs="tcp:66325:3"/>
Miſerable diſtracted World, it muſt be moſtly done by Family-Religion, and the Chriſtian Education of youth. Godlineſs is profitable to all things; but the Curſe of God is in the houſe of the wicked. And the ungodly betrayers of Souls, of themſelves, Children and Servants, will very quickly be Summoned to a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible account: Eſpecially thoſe that ſhould as Rulers be Exemplary to the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, and are aſhamed to own ſerious Family-Religion, as if all beyond ſome formal Hypocriſie and lip labour, were a diſhonour to their houſes, or a needleſs thing.</p>
            <p>Theſe helps which I offer them that need it, is, that when they Read the New Teſtament daily in their Houſes, they may (not read all the Paraphraſe to their Families, but) ſuch particulars of Expoſition and Doctrinal Notes, as they find moſt ſuitable to their caſe.</p>
            <p>And I think it will not be unuſeful, to the Younger and Weaker ſort of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and the Poor ones, that cannot buy larger Commentaries. And if Rich Men will give their Tenants and Neighbours ſuch Books as are ſuitable to the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Families, and the People will diligently uſe them, it may do much to keep up ſaving Knowledge and Practice, where the publick Miniſtry faileth moſt. The God of Mercy Teach Fooliſh Men to have Mercy on their Families and themſelves.</p>

            <head>The New Teſtament of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</head>
            <p>THO it be not known when or by whom all the Books of the New Teſtament, were gathered and made up into one, nor when or by whom this Title was ſet before them, and tho for a time ſome Churches received not the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> nor that of <hi>James</hi>; the 2 of <hi>Peter,</hi> the 2. and 3. of <hi>John,</hi> that of <hi>Jude,</hi> or the <hi>Revelation.</hi> Yet it hath never the leſs ſatisfactory evidence of its Truth, for this uncertainty and delay.</p>
            <p n="1">I. For As long as we know it is all the <hi>word of the Spirit of God,</hi> it ſatisfieth our Faith; whether all be bound up in one Book or in many. And <hi>John</hi> the Apoſtle living long after all the reſt, it is more than probable that none were received in his time, but by his approbation and conſent: and even in the daies of the Apoſtles they gave Teſtimony to the Writings of one another; ſo <hi>Peter</hi> doth of <hi>Pauls,</hi> and <hi>Jude</hi> tranſcribeth much of 2 <hi>Peter</hi> 2. (telling us that even inſpired Apoſtles diſdained not to uſe and repeat each others Writings; without any guilt of vain repetition or being plagiaries.)</p>
            <p n="2">II. And that the few books doubted of by ſome were commonly afterwards received, tends more to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming than the ſhaking of our belief of their Authority: certainty after doubt is the moſt confirmed certainty. It muſt needs be ſome time before all the Churches to whom the ſeveral Epiſtles were written, could produce and Communicate them by convincing proof to all the reſt And yet we muſt know, that the Epiſtles to particular Churches were ſent to them as to members of the Church Univerſal, and they were obliged to communicate them to others: ſo that we muſt not take them as private Letters.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Whoever firſt gave this title to the whole Book (<hi>The New Teſtament, or Covenant,</hi> &amp;c.) it's of no great moment to know: It was [<hi>The New Teſtament</hi>] before it was ſo entitled as one Volume; But the Church hath by continual owning this Title, ſhewed that they have received all theſe Books as Gods word and the whole New Teſtament, and that no more are to be received as ſuch.</p>
            <p>The Word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> (of which <hi>Grotius</hi> in his preface hath ſpoken at large) ſignifieth indeed, Gods <hi>ſtatute Law concerning Mans Duty and Salvation,</hi> or Gods <hi>conſtituted</hi> and <hi>propoſed terms of Life.</hi> And tho <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> more ſtrictly ſignifie uſually a Mutual Covenant; this doth but imply the conſent of Man to the Law or terms of God. It is the ſame thing that is called a Law and a Covenant in ſeveral reſpects. As God enacts it, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgated it, before mans Conſent, it is a Law, and a conditional deed of Gift, and Teſtament; and an offered Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant in ſeveral reſpects. When man conſents it is a Law accepted, a gift and Teſtament accepted, and a <hi>mutual actual Covenant,</hi> the Law hath its introductive Hiſtory and Doctrine, its precepts prohibitions, promiſes, and threats; And the Covenant hath the ſame parts only denominated from mutual conſent. But becauſe there are Laws of more or leſs rigor, and of various tenours; it is the <hi>Law of Faith or Grace</hi> which is the Covenant, Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, and Goſpel, which is now before us denominated from the <hi>Donative</hi> and <hi>Promiſſory</hi> parts, though precept and threatening be included.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. It is of great importance that we err not by giving too little or too much to the ſacred Scriptures, from both which extreams many dangerous errours How. 1. On the left hand, thoſe err that deny it to be Gods word, of infallible truth, intelligible, and <hi>perfect</hi> as to its <hi>proper uſe,</hi> without humane ſupplements written or orall, Doctrinal or Canon Laws: and thoſe that deny it to have infallible aſcertaining evidences of its truth. Theſe be-friend infidelity, hereſies, prophaneſs, Church Tyranny (leaving it to Clergy-men to make us a new Faith, New Sacraments, and a new Religion at their Pleaſure; and to perſecute good men that dare not renounce the Scripture ſufficiency and Chriſts perfection, by obeying their dictates and Cannons as Co-ordinate with Chriſts if not co-equal: Theſe make Church-concord utterly impoſſible, while they deny the ſufficiency not only of the eſſentials, but of all the Bible to be the terms of Concord, without their ſupplements or additions: as if Chriſt that is the Author and finiſher of our Faith, and the maker of his own Church, had not ſo much as told us what a Church or a Chriſtian is, or whom we muſt take for ſuch into our love and Communion, nor fixed the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary terms of Union; but left them to none knoweth whom, even fallible men, lyable to error and Tyranny that can but get uppermoſt, and ſay then that they are the true Church and the Maſters that muſt be obeyed, while they are themſelves of as many minds, as they are of different Countrys, intereſts and degrees of knowledge and ſincerity.</p>
            <p n="2">2. On the other ſide thoſe overdo in aſcribing to the Scripture, who ſay that God had no Church, or the Church no infallable rule of Faith and life, before the writing of i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>: and who ſay that men converted by the Creed, Catechiſmes preaching, or tradition without knowing the Scripture can have no ſaving faith; and that think none can be ſaved that doubt of any Canonical Books, text or matter whether it be Gods word; or that ſay Scripture is ſo perfect that there is no humane imperfection of the Pen-Men foun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> in phraſe, word or method, and that God could not have made it better, or that every Book may be known to be Canonical, and every reading to be right when copies vary, without Hiſtorical tradition by its own evident light, and that we have no more cauſe
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:66325:5"/>
to doubt of any word or matter, than of the truth of the Goſpel; and that Reaſon is of ſmall uſe either for the proof or expoſition of the Scripture, but the moſt illiterate if he found a Bible that he had never heard of, may by its own light know its truth, and ſenſe as well as ſtudious learned Men, and that no other Books need to be read<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and that the Scripture is a ſufficient teacher of Phyſick, Logick, Grammar, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that nothing is to be uſed or done in the <hi>External Forms, Modes,</hi> and <hi>Accidents,</hi> of Gods <hi>Worſhip,</hi> but what is particularly commanded in Scripture, and that it telleth every man whether he be ſincere and juſtified or not, and not only telleth him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ow to know it by inward evidence; with many other ſuch miſtakes, proceeding from miſtaking the uſe of the Scripture, by which its perfection muſt be meaſured. Which all tend to confuſion, and at laſt to infidelity, or doubting of the whole, when theſe errour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> are diſcerned.</p>
            <p n="5">V. And tho all the Scripture be of equal truth, as it is Gods word, yet many untruths are in it as uttered by Men and Devils; which God truly recordeth. And all parts are not of equal neceſſity or weight: And as many err by caſting off the Old Teſtament, ſo others err by equalling it to us with the New: It is Gods word, left to acquaint us what was heretofore, and to ſhew us how Chriſt was propheſied of and expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and how the Church was governed in the darker and more ſervile ſtate and times. But we have great cauſe to take heed of overvaluing its uſe to us; leſt we contradict <hi>Paul</hi> that ſaith that even that which was written in ſtone is done away, and the Law Changed with the Prieſthood, and the old and faulty Covenant for a Better; of which ſee the nine firſt Chapters to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> &amp;c.

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n the holy Patriarks, and <hi>David</hi> had a far more obſcure Revelation of Chriſt, and grace and the love of God, and the glory to come, then we have: And accordingly we ſhould have much more faith, holineſs and comfort than they. It is dangerous making the beſt of them our Examples in points of faith or duty, wherein they came far ſhort of Goſpel light and grace. God doth not now bear with Poligamy as lie did then, nor with ſuch divorces; nor doth the Goſpel countenance ſuch ſtreams of blood as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ordinarily ſhed, nor ſuch lies as <hi>David</hi> was oft guilty of; nor ſuch a ſtrange life as <hi>Solomon</hi> lived: I mean, that ſuch faults will not now conſiſt with true grace under our fuller light and mercy, as would do then to men in a darker infant Age; and therefore let us take heed of preſuming on their Examples: Chriſt and his Apoſtles are far fitter for our imitation. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> fills moſt of his Pſalms with ſuch complaints of his Enemies, and curſes againſt them as ſhew a far deeper ſenſe of the ſuffering of the fleſh, and the concerns of this life, than <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> ſhewed, who ſuffered far more, and for a holier cauſe, and rejoyced in tribulation; and then is ſuitable either to the precepts or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of Chriſt. All was not well ſaid and done by good men which is recited in the New Teſtament, much leſs in the old.</p>
            <p>So far are they miſtaken, that ſay, the Jews and Gentiles were bound to believe the Apoſtles in no more than they proved out of the Scripture, that moſt of the Creed was to be believed by other evidences, And Chriſt and his Apoſtles gave us ſo full proof of the truth of the Goſpel, as that their atteſtation of the Old Teſtament is to us a more convincing proof of its Divine Authority, than any others.</p>
            <p>Therefore Chriſtians muſt read and honour the Old Teſtament, and ſtudy it, but the New far more; to which it is that the Heart and Life muſt be conformed. There Heavenly glory ſhineth far more clearly, and the wonders of Divine Love are more abundantly manifeſted; and far greater power of the Spirit is given to make all effectual in faith, hope, and Patience, humility, obedience, and love, which now are become the very nature of a true believer.</p>

In thoſe daies <hi>John</hi> as a Prophet inſpired by God, Baptized upon preaching in the Wilderneſs of <hi>Judea</hi>; that the Kingdom of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> long looked for, was now juſt at hand: and therefore they ſhould by true Repentance be prepared for its Entertainment</p>

                  <hi>N.</hi> 1. Its called the Kingdom of Heaven, becauſe, it is a Theocracy, a Special Government of God by a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour ſent from Heaven to lead men to Heaven: as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from the prophane Kingdomes of the World, who look but to humane power and Laws and bodily proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity. 2.

Was here fulfilled, The Jews longed for Chriſts coming ſuppoſing it would have exalted their Nations in temporal proſperity, but could not endure him when he was for humility; ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituality, and a heavenly Kingdom.</p>
               <p rend="small">3. Tho repentance be always a duty, its ſpecially neceſſary to our ſpecial and great mercies; and our aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of pardon by a ſaviour. A purified mind

and life are ſuitable to the conſolation of Chriſt and the indwelling of the comforting Spirit.</p>
               <p n="3">3. For this is he that was ſpoken of by the Prophet Eſaias, ſaying, The voice of one crying in the Wilderneſs, prepare ye the way of Lord, make his paths ſtreight.</p>
               <p rend="small">3. It was <hi>John</hi> that <hi>Iſaiah</hi> propheſied of, and foretold what his preaching ſhould be. Tho it be grace that prepareth for further grace, mans duty muſt be uſed thereunto, and the exalting works of grace preſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the humbling work of repentance as a neceſſary preparation.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And the ſame John had his rayment of Camels hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins, and his meat was locuſts and wild hony.</p>
               <p rend="small">4. He was cloathed with Haircloth, bound to him with a leather girdle, and fed on what the wilderneſs afforded, which was Locuſts (which ſome think were an Herb ſo called, but moſt a ſort of flies like great Graſhoppers that devour all green things,) and wild Hony.</p>
               <p rend="small">
                  <hi>Note,</hi> Tho the Fryers and Hermits by ſuperſtitious overvaluing ſuch auſterity, have tempted others to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe them, yet God approved of <hi>Johns</hi> ſignification of his contempt of the world and fleſhly pleaſures by ſuch abaſing of the fleſh. And other mens ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Hypocriſie, will not excuſe mens ſuperfluity, or accuſe mortification.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Then went out to him Jeruſalem, and all Judea, and all the Region round Jordan. 6. And were baptized of him in Jordan, confeſſing their ſins.</p>
               <p rend="small">5. So glad were the People to hear that the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> was at hand, that they all flockt to him to be baptized, profeſſing repentance, that they might be prepared for the Kingdom.</p>
               <p rend="small">
                  <hi>Note,</hi> 1.

Tho many ſay <hi>Johns</hi> baptiſm and Chriſts were all one, its eaſie to prove that were any now bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized but with <hi>John</hi>'s baptiſm, he ought to be baptized again, in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt, on the profeſſion of many Articles of the Creed which <hi>John</hi> required not.</p>

               <p rend="small">7. Knowing what theſe Phariſees and Saducees were, he ſaid [O generation of Vipers.] Are you aware indeed that wrath is coming upon you? And do you think that the Meſſiah will indulge your ſin, and come to promote your carnal intereſt?

               <p rend="small">9.

               <p n="11">11. I indeed baptize you with water to repentance: But he that cometh after me, is mighter then I, whoſe ſhoes I am not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to bear: he ſhall baptize you with the Holy Ghoſt and with fire.</p>
               <p rend="small">11. I do but baptize you preparatorily with water to repentance: But he that is coming after me, is mightier than I, whoſe ſhoes I am not worthy to bear: he ſhall baptize not only with Water, but with the pouring out of his Spirit on believers, and with that fiery tryal, which ſhall refine the gold, the faithful, but ſeparate the droſs, and deſtroy the rebellious unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers.</p>

               <p n="13">13. Then cometh Jeſus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be baptized of him. 14. But John forbad him ſaying, I have need to be baptized of thee, and comeſt thou to me?</p>

                  <hi>N.</hi> This hard Text is variouſly expounded: 1. Some ſay, that the <hi>Romans</hi> deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is Chriſt's coming here meant. 2.

It ſeems to me more probable that it is own open de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring himſelf to be the Chriſt, and that his Kingdom is come: For, 1. he yet preached but much like <hi>John,</hi> that the Kingdom of God (the Meſſiah) is at hand. 2.

               <p rend="small">1. Having given his twelve Diſciples their inſtructions, he went about alſo to preach himſelf.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Now when John had heard in the priſon the works of Chriſt, he ſent two of his diſciples, 3. And ſaid to him, Art thou he that ſhould come, or do we look for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?</p>
               <p rend="small">2, 3. <hi>Note,</hi> It is doubtful whether (<hi>John</hi> being in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and not ſeeing Jeſus) the meaning be, Art thou the ſame Jeſus that I baptized, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or, (as is more likely) that he ſent his Diſciples that they might be convinced by more than <hi>John</hi>'s teſtimony.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Jeſus anſwered and ſaid to them, Go and ſhew John again thoſe things which ye do hear and ſee. 5. The blind receive their ſight, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleanſed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raiſed up, and the poor have the goſpel prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched to them. 6. And bleſſed is he who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhall not be offended in me.</p>
               <p rend="small">4, 5, 6. It is not my bare word but my works that ſhall anſwer you: it is by the fruit that the tree muſt be known: The miraculous works of Divine Power are done, and the works of love to mens bodies, and the Goſpel of Salvation is preached for their Souls. And theſe being Gods works, are Gods teſtimony what I am. And yet the meanneſs of my appearance, and my contempt and ſuffering from men, will be to many, a ſtumbling block, and make the work of believing diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, and bleſſed are they that believe notwithſtanding all theſe difficulties.</p>

               <p n="1">1. AT that time Jeſus went on the Sabbath day through the corn, and his diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples were hungry, and began to pluck the ears of corn, and to eat.</p>
               <p rend="small">
                  <hi>Note,</hi> Both the labour and the early eating ſeem here meant, but ſpecially the firſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But when the Phariſees ſaw it, they ſaid to him, Behold, thy diſciples do that which is not lawful to do on the ſabbath day.</p>
               <p rend="small">2. Art thou a good Teacher who ſuffereſt thy Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to break Gods law?</p>
               <p rend="small">
                  <hi>Note,</hi> That the Phariſees controverſie againſt Chriſt was, that he was not religious, and ſtrict enough in keeping Gods Law: ſo that pretended ſtrictneſs is no proof that men are in the right.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But he ſaid to them, Have ye not read what David did when he was hungred, and they that were with him, 4. How he entred into the houſe of God, and did eat the ſhew-bread, which was not lawful for him to eat, nor for them that were with him, but only for the prieſts? 5. Or have ye not read in the law, how that on the ſabbath days the prieſts in the temple profane the ſabbath, and are blameleſs?</p>
               <p rend="small">3, 4, 5. Your ſtrictneſs and your accuſation of my Diſciples, are but from your ignorance of the Scripture. Have ye not read that hunger juſtified <hi>David</hi> and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany for eating the conſecrated Bread, which elſe none but the Prieſts might lawfully eat. And that the Prieſts in the temple labour on the Sabbath, and break the outward reſt of the day, which would be profanation, did not the Temple ſervice juſtifie it.</p>
               <p n="6">6. But I ſay to you, that in this place is one greater than the temple.</p>
               <p rend="small">6. But if the Temple ſervice can juſtifie labour, I am greater than the Temple, and my ſervice and authority can juſtifie it.</p>
               <p n="7">7. But if ye had known what this mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, I will have mercy and not ſacrifice, ye would not have condemned the guiltleſs.</p>
               <p rend="small">7. If inſtead of ignorant preciſeneſs for Ceremonies, you had but learnt the true meaning of God, in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring mercy before Sacrifice, you would not have thought that Ceremonies and externals are commanded men for their hurt, and muſt be obſerved againſt mercy to our ſelves or others: Gods commands are all for mans good; and he maketh not externals and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies for a ſnare to hurt men. You would not have cenſured the guiltleſs as ſinners had you underſtood this.</p>
               <p rend="small">
                  <hi>Note,</hi> This (twice repeated) moſt openly condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the Papal Church Government.</p>
               <p n="8">8. For the Son of man is Lord even of the ſabbath-day.</p>
               <p rend="small">8. And as <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law was but to lead men to Chriſt, in whom it is fulfilled; ſo it cannot bind any againſt him and his authority and ſaving work; for which works ſake all things are delivered into his hands; even the Law and Sabbath, of which he is Lord.</p>
               <p n="9">9, 10. And when he was departed thence, he went into their Synagogue: And behold, there was a man who had his hand withered, and they asked him, ſaying, Is it lawful to to heal on the ſabbath-day? that they might accuſe him.</p>
               <p rend="small">9, 10. <hi>Note,</hi> That the ceremonial outward ſtrictneſs of hypocrites, is uſed to enſnare and hurt thoſe that are not of their mind.</p>
               <p n="11">11. And he ſaid to them, What man ſhall there be among you that ſhall have one ſheep, and if it fall into a pit on the ſabbath-day, will he not lay hold on it, and lift it out?</p>
               <p rend="small">11. Will you not draw a ſheep out of a pit on the Sabbath-day, if you have but one.</p>
               <p n="12">12. How much then is a man better than a ſheep? wherefore it is lawful to do well on the ſabbath-days.</p>
               <p rend="small">12. It is lawfull to prefer and do a greater duty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a leſs.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Then ſaith he to the man, Stretch forth thy hand: and he ſtretched it forth, and it was reſtored whole like as the other.</p>
               <p n="14">14. Then the Phariſees went out, and held a council againſt him, how they might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy him.</p>
               <p rend="small">13, 14. <hi>Note,</hi> That it is part of the Religion of Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, to deſtroy men for doing the greateſt good, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their Laws.</p>
               <p n="15">15. But when Jeſus heard it, he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew himſelf from thence, and great multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes followed him, and he healed them all: 16. And charged them that they ſhould not make him known.</p>
               <p rend="small">15, 16. <hi>Note,</hi> 1. It is a duty to avoid the hands of Murderers and Perſecutors, unleſs when our ſufferings are like to do more good than our lives. 2. Chriſt forbid them making him known, partly to avoid the envy and rage of perſecutors, and partly becauſe the time was not yet come, till all his works ſet together with his Reſurrection and Spirit, ſhould make up a full proof.</p>
               <p n="17">17, 18. That it might be fulfilled which was ſpoken by Eſaias the prophet, ſaying, Behold, my ſervant whom I have choſen, my beloved in whom my ſoul is well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed:
<pb facs="tcp:66325:19"/>
I will put my Spirit upon him, and he ſhall ſhew judgment to the Gentiles. 19. He ſhall not ſtrive, nor cry, neither ſhall any man hear his voice in the ſtreets. 20. A bruiſed reed ſhall he not break, and ſmoaking flax ſhall he not quench, till he ſend forth judgment unto victory. 21. And in his name ſhall the Gentiles truſt.</p>
               <p rend="small">17, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In all this he fulfilled what was propheſied by <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> Behold, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Him whom I have ſelected for this work of Salvation, in whom I am well pleaſed, as fulfilling all my will; He ſhall have the fulneſs of the Spirit, and he ſhall teach the Nations the way of Truth and Righteouſneſs; He ſhall not ſubdue men by tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults, violence, or wars, but as the Prince of Peace and Grace, he ſhall deal gently with the weak, and cheriſh the leaſt degree of goodneſs, and pardon the faults of the penitent, and not uſe ſeverity of Juſtice, till he have gathered his Church out of the world, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come and judged his final enemies: And it is he in whom all nations ſhall be bleſſed.</p>
               <p n="22">22. Then was brought to him one poſſeſſed with a devil, blind and dumb, and he hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him, inſomuch that the blind and dumb both ſpake and ſaw.</p>
               <p n="23">23. And all the people were amazed, and ſaid, Is not this the ſon of David?</p>
               <p rend="small">22, 23. This people were ſo aſtoniſhed to ſee his works, that they ſaid, Sure this is the Meſſiah the ſon of <hi>David.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="24">24. But when the Phariſees heard it, they ſaid, This fellow doth not caſt out devils, but by Beel-zebub the prince of the devils. 25. And Jeſus knew their thoughts, and ſaid to them, Every kingdom divided againſt it ſelf is brought to deſolation; and every city and houſe divided againſt it ſelf ſhall not ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p rend="small">24, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Phariſees could not deny the matter of fact, it being notorious, and therefore they had no ſhift left for their unbelief, but ſaying, that <hi>All ſuch works are not of God; The Prince of Devils to deceive the people, giveth him power to caſt out devils, and do his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles.</hi> But Chriſt ſaid, If the Devil have a Kingdom, he hath wit to preſerve it; Is it the Devils work to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> do good to mens Souls and Bodies?

Are they all conjurers too? Therefore they ſhall be witneſs againſt your unbelief and blaſphemy: But if all this be certainly done by me by no leſs power than the Spirit of God, you ſhould ſee that this is Gods atteſtation to me, and that his Kingdom is come, in which the Meſſiah is to conquer Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, and deſtroy his works.</p>

Judge of the tree by the fruit: Of the power which I work by, by the works: If it be no good work to heal the Sick, and Blind, and Lame, and caſt out Devils, and preach repentance and forgiveneſs of ſin, to convert and ſave Souls, then God is not the Author of them. If they be bad works, they have a bad cauſe; If they be good works, they have a good Author: ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſay plainly (you that aſcribe them to the Devil) that the works are good, and the Devil is good: or elſe that the Devil is bad and the works are bad: Or if you confeſs the works to be good, confeſs that they are done by the Spirit of God.</p>

I need go no farther for an inſtance than your ſelves; were you not a generation of Vipers, the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents ſeed, ye would not blaſpheme the Holy Ghoſt and his works: for your mouths ſpeak out of the evil of which your heart is full: As you are, ſo you ſpeak; you are ſo bad that you cannot ſpeak well: And if I work'd by the <hi>Devil,</hi> my works would be bad as the Devil is.</p>
               <p n="35">35. A good man out of the good treaſure of his heart, bringeth forth good things: and an evil man out of the evil treaſure bringeth forth evil things.</p>

               <p n="1">1. THe ſame day went Jeſus out of the houſe, and ſat by the ſea ſide. 2. And great multitudes were gathered together to him, ſo that he went into a ſhip and ſat, and the whole multitude ſtood on the ſhore. 3. And he ſpake many things to them in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rables, ſaying, Behold, a ſower went forth to ſow.</p>
               <p rend="small">1, 2, 3. <hi>N.</hi> Chriſt thought a Ship, or a Houſe, or a Mountain no unmeet place to preach in, and yet avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not the Temple or Synagogues. 2. They that will have the word with Gods bleſſing muſt follow after it. 3. Similitudes were ſuitable to ſuch learners<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 4. Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching is like ſowing ſeed.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And when he ſowed, ſome ſeeds fell by the way ſide, and the fowls came and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured them up. 5. Some fell on ſtony places, where they had not much earth; and forthwith they ſprang up, becauſe they had no deepneſs of earth. 6. And when the ſun was up they were ſcorched, and becauſe they had not root, they withered away. 7. And ſome fell among thorns, and the thorns ſprang up and choked them. 8. But other fell into good ground, and brought forth fruit, ſome an hundred fold, ſome ſixty fold, ſome thirty fold. 9. Who hath ears to hear let him hear.</p>
               <p rend="small">4, <hi>&amp;c. Note,</hi> The firſt ſort was not earthed. The ſecond ſort had little earth and rooting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the third ſort had earth and root, but among thorns which had grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter poſſeſſion, and choaked it. Of ſo great weight is it to underſtand this difference of hearers, that it is as much as our ears and underſtandings are worth.</p>
               <p n="10">10, 11. And the diſciples came and ſaid to him, Why ſpeakeſt thou to them in para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles? He anſwered and ſaid to them, Becauſe it is given to you, to know the myſteries of the kingdom of heaven; but to them it is not given.</p>
               <p rend="small">10, 11. Becauſe tho God hath given you ſome know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge already of the myſteries of the Kingdom of the Meſſiah, theſe men are ignorant like children, and muſt be taught by familiar ſimilitudes accordingly, being yet uncapable of other manner of teaching.</p>
               <p n="12">12. For whoſoever hath, to him ſhall be given, and he ſhall have more abundance; but whoſoever hath not, from him ſhall be taken away even that he hath.</p>
               <p rend="small">12. For here it is true, that <hi>to him that hath ſhall be given, &amp;c.</hi> He that hath already the underſtanding of the rudiments and fundamentals, is thereby capable of receiving and underſtanding more: one truth openeth the way unto another: But they that have no conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable knowledge, are hardly taught it, and if it be by their wilfull neglect or contempt, are like by their guilt and folly to loſe all the profitable uſe even of their reaſon.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Therefore I ſpeak to them in parables, becauſe they ſeeing ſee not, hearing they
<pb facs="tcp:66325:21"/>
hear not, neither do they underſtand. 14. And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Eſaias, which ſaith, By hearing ye ſhall hear, and not underſtand, and ſeeing, ye ſhall ſee, and ſhall not perceive. 15. For this peoples heart is waxed groſs, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes they have cloſed, leſt at any time they ſhould ſee with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand with their heart, and ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, and I ſhould heal them.</p>
               <p rend="small">13, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I ſpeak to them in ſimilitudes, as children muſt be firſt taught to ſpell, becauſe tho they have underſtanding, eyes and ears, they are ſo ignorant that they underſtand not even what eyes and ears and reaſon tell them. As the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by wilful neglect of knowledge are ſuch, as will not underſtand even what they hear and ſee: For their hearts are ſtupifyed, and their underſtanding ſo dull, and they have ſo ſinfully ſhut their own eyes, for want of care and love to truth, that thus they keep out the knowledge of the Goſpel, and ſhut out my offered grace, which elſe would convince and convert them, and they would be healed.</p>
               <p rend="small">
                  <hi>Note,</hi> 1. That the way of <hi>Parables</hi> is not mentioned as an obſcure way to hide the truth: but as a low fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar way, as ignorant carnal men are capable of. 2. The Prophecy, nor Chriſt, means not that its Gods intent to hide the truth leſt it convert men, but that this is the effect and event of their own wilfull neglect, whereby their converſion is as effectually hindred, as if they did it purpoſely, leſt they ſhould be converted.</p>
               <p n="16">16. But bleſſed are your eyes, for they ſee; and your ears, for they hear. 17. For verily I ſay to you, that many Prophets and righteous men have deſired to ſee thoſe things which ye ſee, and have not ſeen them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to hear thoſe things which ye hear and have not heard them.</p>
               <p rend="small">16, 17. How great is Gods mercy to you, that hath given you both teaching and underſtanding, by which you are made capable of more. I tell you, prophets and righteous men of old, did deſire to ſee and hear what you do, but it was not granted them, but reſerved for you.</p>
               <p n="18">18, 19. Hear ye therefore the parable of the ſower. When any one heareth the word of the Kingdom, and underſtandeth it not; then cometh the wicked one, and catcheth away that which was ſown in his heart: this is he which receiveth ſeed by the way ſide.</p>
               <p rend="small">18, 19. <hi>Note.</hi> 1. By not underſtanding is meant alſo, Not conſidering it to take it in: 2. It is ſaid to be <hi>ſown in his heart,</hi> only becauſe it was by the ſower ſo inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but not as there received.</p>
               <p n="20">20. But he that received the ſeed into ſtony places, the ſame is he that heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it: 21. Yet hath he not root in himſelf, but dureth for a while; for when tribulation or perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ariſeth becauſe of the word, by and by he is offended.</p>
               <p rend="small">20, 21. <hi>Note,</hi> That the reaſon why ſuch fall away, was the want of rooting of the word, is plain. But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch ſhould be ſaved if they had died before they fell away, is a controverſie too long to be here handled, and not ſo needful as ſome think.</p>
               <p n="22">22. He alſo that received ſeed among the thorns, is he that heareth the word; and the cares of this world, and the deceitfulneſs of riches choak the word, and he becometh un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitful.</p>
               <p rend="small">22. That is, He loveth the wealth and proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of this world more than the Word, and ſo that which he moſt loveth doth prevail againſt the other, and he liveth more to the world than unto God; and for the world will forſake his duty, and Chriſt himſelf in ſtrong temptations.</p>
               <p n="23">23. But he that received ſeed into the good ground, is he that heareth the word and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandeth it, which alſo beareth fruit, and bringeth forth ſome an hundred fold, ſome ſixty, ſome thirty.</p>
               <p rend="small">23. <hi>Note, Qu.</hi> What is it that makes the ground cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Good before the receiving of the word? <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. There was a certain degree of faith which was a ſtate of Salvation before Chriſt was perſonally known or prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched as incarnate: Theſe perſons that had this, were good ground, ready to hear the Goſpel when it was preached: Thoſe that truly repented according to <hi>Johns</hi> Preaching, were prepared to receive Chriſt. 2. And thoſe that faithfully obey that Light of Truth alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy revealed to them, deſiring more, are better pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for more, than other men.</p>
               <p n="24">24. Another parable put he forth to them, ſaying, The kingdom of heaven is like to a man that ſowed good ſeed in his field. 25. But while men ſlept, his enemy came and ſowed tares among the wheat, and went his way.</p>
               <p rend="small">24, 25. Another ſimilitude he uſed, to ſhew how the Church will be corrupted with Hereſies and vices.</p>
               <p n="26">26. But when the blade was ſprung up and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares alſo.</p>
               <p rend="small">26. <hi>Note,</hi> Hereſies and Church corruptions appear not at firſt; but when time and temptation ripen them</p>
               <p n="27">27. So the ſervants of the houſholder came and ſaid to him, Sir, didſt thou not ſow
<pb facs="tcp:66325:21"/>
good ſeed in thy field, from whence then hath it tares.</p>
               <p rend="small">27. <hi>Note,</hi> Seeing God and his word are good, it puz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth men to think, how the Church and world come to be ſo bad.</p>
               <p n="28">28. He ſaid to them, An enemy hath done this: The ſervants ſaid to him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up?</p>
               <p n="29">29. But he ſaid, Nay: left while ye ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther up the tares, ye root up alſo the wheat with them.</p>
               <p rend="small">28, 29. <hi>N.</hi> 1. Satan is the ſower of Hereſie and Vice (whoever be his Miniſters.) 2. Miniſters and others are more inclined to vindictive ſeverity oft, than Chriſt is. 3. God forbeareth the hypocrites and wicked (not through in difference but) leſt the godly ſuffer by their deſtruction. 4. Chriſt oft denieth the revengeful and ſevere deſires of his ſervants.</p>
               <p n="30">30. Let them both grow together till the harveſt; and in the time of harveſt, I will ſay to the reapers, Gather ye together firſt the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them, but gather the wheat into my barn.</p>
               <p rend="small">30. <hi>Note,</hi> 1. Gods delay to execute his judgment on the wicked, is no ſign of their ſafety; Their miſery will ſurely come at laſt. 2. We muſt not miſinterpret Gods patience with the ungodly.</p>
               <p n="31">31. Another parable put he forth to them, ſaying, The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of muſtard-ſeed, which a man took and ſowed in his field, 32. Which indeed is the leaſt of all ſeeds, but when it is grown, it is the greateſt among herbs, and becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a tree, ſo that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof.</p>
               <p rend="small">31. As a grain of Muſtard-ſeed is one of the ſmalleſt ſort of ſeeds, and yet becometh a plant like a tree, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So the Kingdom of the Meſſiah beginneth in a few poor men, but ſhall become a Kingdom that ſhall flouriſh in the World, ſo that worldly men ſhall obtrude into it for world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ends, and deſire the protection of Chriſtian Governours.</p>
               <p rend="small">
                  <hi>Note,</hi> That the Muſtard-plant was much greater in <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea</hi> than it is with us.</p>
               <p n="33">33. Another parable ſpake he unto them, The Kingdom of Heaven is like to leaven, which a woman took and hid in three meaſures of meal, till the whole was lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened.</p>
               <p rend="small">33. As a little leaven doth leaven a great quantity of meal, ſo the Goſpel ſhall convert a few at firſt where it comes, and afterward by the help of thoſe few, whole Towns and Countries ſhall turn Chriſtians, and own the Truth.</p>
               <p n="34">34. All theſe things ſpake Jeſus to the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude in parables, and without a parable ſpake he not to them: 35. That it might be fulfilled which was ſpoken by the prophet, ſaying, I will open my mouth in parables, I will utter things which have been kept ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret from the foundation of the world.</p>
               <p rend="small">34, 35. Thus Jeſus taught them only by Similitudes, as it is written, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I will utter great and excellent Myſteries, which former ages have not known, and that by the way of familiar Similitudes.</p>
               <p n="36">36. Then Jeſus ſent the multitude away, and went into the houſe, and his diſciples came to him, ſaying, Declare to us the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable of the tares of the field</p>
               <p rend="small">36. <hi>Note.</hi> It is the part of Learners, to ask their Teachers help to underſtand that which they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not.</p>
               <p n="37">37. He anſwered and ſaid to them, He that ſoweth the good ſeed is the Son of man: 38. The field is the world, the good ſeed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one: 39. The enemy that ſowed them, is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, the harveſt is the end of the world: and the reapers are the angels.</p>
               <p rend="small">37, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is Chriſt that ſoweth the good ſeed, by Preaching the Goſpel and planting the Churches by himſelf and his ſervants. The World is the firſt object of the Goſpel preached, and out of which believers are gathered: The good ſeed (as ſown is the Goſpel, but) as ſpringing up in fruit, are the faithful, who are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly the members of the Church of Chriſt: The Tares (as ſown are evil doctrines and temptations, but) as ſprung up in fruit are the Children of the Devil, who is the father of wickedneſs; The enemy of God and goodneſs and man that ſowed them, by himſelf and his ſervants, ſignifieth the Devil: the time of harveſt is, the end of this world, even the day of judgment: The reapers or executioners are the Angels.</p>
               <p n="40">40. As therefore the tares are gathered and burnt in the fire, ſo ſhall it be in the end of this world: 41. The Son of man ſhall ſend forth his angels, and they ſhall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity. 42. And ſhall caſt them into a furnace of fire, there ſhall be wailing and gnaſhing of teeth.</p>
               <p rend="small">40, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So in the end of this World: Chriſt ſhall ſend forth his Angels as his executing Miniſters; and they ſhall gather out of the world (which he is over) and ſpecially out of the <hi>viſible Church,</hi> all rebellious un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy, wicked, ſcandalous, carnal men, and ſhall caſt them into hell, which is likened to a lake of Fire; where they ſhall, in torment and a ſelf-afflicting Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>
               <p n="43">43. Then ſhall the righteous ſhine forth
<pb facs="tcp:66325:22"/>
as the ſun in the kingdom of their Father: who hath ears to hear let him hear.</p>
               <p rend="small">43. Then ſhall the righteous who are now obſcured by infirmities and malignant ſlanders, and are oppreſſed in the world, ſhine forth in glory in the Kingdom of Love, even of God as their Father in Chriſt, as the Sun ſhineth in the heavens in reſplendent glory. As ever you will uſe your ears or underſtandings, believe and foreſee this glorious bleſſed day to Believers.</p>
               <p n="44">44. Again, the kingdom of heaven is like to a treaſure hid in a field, the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof, goeth and ſelleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.</p>
               <p rend="small">44. The way of Salvation by Chriſt, ſheweth men the certain hopes of ſo ineſtimable a treaſure in the life to come, as maketh the ſaithful chooſe it for their beſt, and part with all the pleaſure, profit, and honour of the world to obtain it.</p>
               <p n="45">45. Again, the kingdom of heaven is like to a merchant man ſeeking goodly pearls: 46. Who when he had found one of geat price, he went and ſold all that he had and bought it.</p>
               <p rend="small">45, 46. <hi>Note,</hi> He that findeth not by faith, enough in the love of God and heavenly glory, and in Chriſt the way thereto, to make him conſent ſincerely and practically to ſell or part with all the world rather than loſe it, is not capable of a juſt title to it, nor ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it.</p>
               <p n="47">47. Again the kingdom of heaven is like a net which was caſt into the ſea, and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered of every kind: 48. Which when it was full, they drew to the ſhore, and ſat down, and gathered the good into veſſels, but caſt the bad away.</p>
               <p rend="small">47, 48. The Church is gathered as men by caſting a net into the Sea gather fiſhes, good and bad: And at the day of judgment, Chriſt will take the good to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and caſt away the bad to hell.</p>
               <p rend="small">
                  <hi>Note,</hi> 1. It is not to be wondered at, that the viſible Church hath good and bad. 2. Yet this is not the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of the Goſpel, which is fitted to make all good, but by the intruſion of Hypocrites. Nor is it an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe for the neglect of diſcipline, and the juſt diſcrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the good and bad.</p>
               <p n="49">49. So ſhall it be at the end of the world, The angels ſhall come forth, and ſever the wicked from among the juſt. 50. And ſhall caſt them into the furnace of fire: there ſhall be wailing and gnaſhing of teeth.</p>
               <p rend="small">49, 50. Theſe plain and dreadful words, more need bel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p n="51">51. Jeſus ſaith to them, Have ye under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood all theſe things? they ſay to him, Yea, Lord. 52. Then ſaid he to them, There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore every ſcribe which is inſtructed to the Kingdom of heaven, is like to a man that is an houſholder, which bringeth forth out of his treaſure things new and old.</p>
               <p rend="small">51, 52. All that are furniſhed with holy knowledge, and are fitted to teach others, muſt have an habitual treaſure of it in their minds, from whence they may be able to open the truth, exhort, reprove, and confute all the erroneous on all juſt occaſions: as a Houſe-keeper is ſtockt for the proviſion of his family.</p>
               <p n="53">53, 54. And it came to paſs that when Jeſus had finiſhed theſe parables, he departed thence. And when he was come into his own countrey, he taught them in their Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue, inſomuch that they were aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſaid, whence hath this man this wiſdom, and theſe mighty works? 55, 56. Is not this the carpenters ſon, is not his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther called Mary, and his brethren, James, and Joſes, and Simon, and Jude, and his ſiſters are they not all with us? whence then hath this man all theſe things? And they were offended in him.</p>
               <p rend="small">53, <hi>&amp;c. Note,</hi> 1. Familiarity breeds contempt. It is no impediment to our faith, that we ſaw not Chriſts perſon, parentage, and education. 2. Carnal men are not ſatisfied by the evidence of Divine atteſtation, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they can give a reaſon of it, and overcome the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty and ſcandal of objections. 3. It is uncertain whether <hi>Mary</hi> had other Children after Jeſus, or theſe were his brethren, or only his kindred.</p>
               <p n="57">57, 58. But Jeſus ſaid to them, A prophet is not without honour, ſave in his own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and in his own houſe. And he did not many mighty works there becauſe of their unbelief.</p>

And if he neglect to hear them, (having exerciſed due patience for the trial, and fit means to convince him) then make it publick, by telling the Church, in whoſe communion he liveth; either by opening it in the Congregation that the Church-Guides may reprove him and exhort him to repent, and pray for his repentance; or when that is not convenient, tell it the Guides of the Church that they may make it publick and do their office. And if he neglect to hear, this publick exhortation, have no more communion or familiarity with him than with a Heathen or Publican, but ſo carry it that he and others may ſee that thou eſteemeſt him not as one of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Society whom Chriſt will own.</p>
               <p rend="small">
                  <hi>Note,</hi> This Text which is Chriſts Law of Church-diſcipline, is perverted divers ways, by ſeveral ſorts of miſtakers. Some feign that it ſpeaketh not of ſins a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, but of injuries againſt men: and that by the Church is meant the Civil Judicature that then was, (inferiour or ſuperior Sanhedrim.) But, 1. it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that it is to Chriſtians or Diſciples that Chriſt gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth this Law; others received no Law from him. And it was how to deal with a Brother in order to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and Salvation, as the foregoing verſes ſhew. 2. Chriſt knew that the Sanhedrim were his deadly enemies, and foretold that they would condemn him; And therefore never made a Law to his Diſciples to uſe them as their ordinary Judicature. 3. He knew that they would hate and perſecute his Diſciples, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore never ſent them to them for right. 4. He came to ubrogate <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, and overthrow their Moſaick policy: And therefore did not eſtabliſh it by this Law. 5. He could never mean that Chriſtians muſt take him for a Heathen that heard not the Jews Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, when <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he foretold them how that Council would
<pb facs="tcp:66325:27"/>
ſcourge them in their Synagogues, and caſt out their names, and ſay all manner of evil of them falſly.</p>
               <p rend="small">1 Nor did Chriſt ſet up a Chriſtian Judicature of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, having the power of the ſword inſtead of the Jewiſh. For, 1. Chriſt himſelf refuſed to uſe ſuch a power, on earth. 2. He forbad it his Diſciples that ſtrove for it. 3. The Text ſpeaketh of no forcing power, but perſwaſive, and of no penalty but Aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and diſowning. 4. The Apoſtles did never ſet up any ſuch coactive Civil Judicature, nor the Church after them for 300 years and much more: which they would have done had Chriſt commanded it. 5. But they did ſet up ſuch Eccleſiaſtick Judicatures wherever they gathered Churches; which was their actual viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble expoſition of this Law of Chriſt. 6. It is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, or recovery of Lands, Goods or Rights that is here mentioned as the end; but the <hi>Winning</hi> of a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by repentance. 7. And what is more noted by Chriſt as an offence or treſpaſs againſt us, than ſcandal, and diſhonouring the Chriſtian name and ſociety, and grieving good men by ſinning againſt God. I think theſe evidences prove paſt doubt, that it is the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of Chriſtian Churches Chriſt here inſtitutes by a ſtanding Law; for which he gave the power of the Keys.</p>
               <p rend="small">2. The Church is told and heard when the Rulers are told and heard, either before the whole congregation, or that they may publiſh it. The whole congregation is not to ſpeak and be heard, nor neceſſarily to be told by the offended himſelf. But as the city is ſaid to <hi>Receive</hi> and to <hi>Execute</hi> any Order from the King, when the Magiſtrates do their part in it, and the people theirs, ſo it is with the Church.</p>
               <p rend="small">3. But how the telling of one Lay-chancellor or Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilian, and hearing or not hearing him, and being Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate by him concerns this Law, I know not, no nor telling or not hearing one ſingle perſon that judgeth alone over many hundred Churches at a diſtance and without their notice.</p>
               <p rend="small">4. This diſcipline is of great moment, for the honour of Chriſt and his Church, that it be not as impure as the Infidel world, nor a Swine-fly inſtead of a Society of Saints; And that it may be known that Chriſt came not as deceivers do, to get himſelf a number of follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers as bad as other men, but to ſanctifie a peculiar peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to God, zealous of good works, and forſaking the world, the fleſh and the devil; and to keep Chriſtians from the ſnare and the ſhame of infectious and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Aſſociates: and to keep ſin under open diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace.</p>
               <p rend="small">5. Yet if Paſtors neglect this holy diſcipline, the ſin is theirs: It doth not neceſſitate the innocent to forſake the Church, unleſs their Doctrine or Practice amount to a profeſt rejection of ſome eſſentials of Chriſtianity, or elſe, they force men to ſin or own their ſin. But they that can chuſe better without more hurt than benefit, ſhould prefer it before undiſciplined Chuches.</p>

I tell you that my Church on earth is the Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary or Suburbs of my Church in heaven, and thoſe that you as my Miniſters abſolve according to my word, they being not deceitful, but true profeſſors of faith, and repentance, they ſhall be abſolved in heaven; And thoſe that you bind over as impenitent to my judgment, being ſuch indeed, ſhall be condemned and ſhut out of heaven: and I will own and confirm your judgment of men by the power I give you, if you do it according to my word.</p>

Therefore do not you ſeparate that which God hath ſo nearly united.</p>

               <p rend="small">8. You miſtake a permiſſion for a command: your Fathers were an ignorant dull unruly ſort of people, and <hi>Moſes</hi> was put to make but ſuch Laws as they could bear: Therefore he permitted putting away, but only commanded that they ſhould not do it without a bill of Divorcement.</p>

               <p n="12">12.

Some brought their children to him that he would lay his hands on them and bleſs them according to their infant capacity: and the Diſciples chid them away, thinking ſuch company below him: But Jeſus ſaid, Hinder them not, and forbid not little children to come or be brought to me: For I tell you, that it is not the ſelf-conceitedly wiſe, but thoſe that are as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to learn and be ruled as ſuch children are, that yet ſet not their wit and will againſt inſtruction, but are as it were beginning the world, that will make up the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church.</p>

               <p rend="small">21. Jeſus ſaid, the ſtate of Chriſtianity, or Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for Salvation, is this, Reſolvedly and Practically, to prefer Heaven, before all the Proſperity of this World, ſo as to part with All, for Heaven, when thou art Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to it: Therefore I will now try thee, whether thou canſt do this.

               <p rend="small">22. But this ſeemed ſo hard a Motion to him, that he would not conſent, but went away ſorrowful; for he was very rich.</p>
               <p n="23">23. Then ſaid Jeſus to his Diſciples, Verily I ſay to you, That a rich man ſhall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven. 24 And again, I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p rend="small">23.24. The difficulty of a Rich Man's being a ſound Chriſtian and Saved is great, that I may expreſs it by the common Proverb, of a Camels going through a Needles Eye.</p>
               <p n="25">25. When his Diſciples heard it, they were exceedingly amazed, ſaying, Who then can be ſaved? 26. But Jeſus beheld them, and ſaid to them, With men this is impoſſible, but with God, all things are poſſible.</p>

This amazing the Diſciples, he ſaid, So na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally and ſtrongly do men love this World, and its Proſperity, and ſo hardly do they believe, and love the unſeen Heavenly Felicity, that it is impoſſible for meer fleſhly Man, to make ſo great a change upon the heart; But the Grace of Almighty God, can, and will do it.</p>
               <p n="27">27. Then anſwered Peter, and ſaid to him, Behold, we have forſaken all, and followed thee, What ſhall we have therefore.</p>
               <p rend="small">27. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid, We have conſented to thy termes, and forſaken All, and followed thee: What ſhall be our reward?</p>
               <p n="28">28. And Jesus ſaid to them, Verily I ſay to you, that ye which have followed me in the Regeneration, when the Son of man ſhall ſit on the Throne of his glory, ye alſo ſhall ſit on twelve thrones, judging the Twelve Tribes of Iſrael.</p>

               <p n="2">2. And when he had agreed with the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers for a penny a day, he ſent them into his vineyard.</p>

               <p n="3">3. And he went out about the third hour, and ſaw others ſtanding idle in the market-place. 4. And ſaid unto them, Go ye alſo into the vineyard, and what ever is right I will give you. And they went their way. 5. Again, he went out about the ſixth and

ninth hour, and did likewiſe. 6. And about the Eleventh hour he went out, and found others ſtanding idle, and ſaith to them. Why ſtand ye here all the day idle? 7. They ſay to him, Becauſe no man hath hired us. He ſaith to them, Go ye alſo into the Vineyard, and what ever is right, that ſhall ye receive.</p>
               <p rend="small">3. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The hours were about Nine a Clock, and at Twelve, and at Three, and at Five. God is not for idleneſs; but hath work for all times and Ages.</p>
               <p n="8">8. So when even was come, the lord of the vineyard ſaith to his Steward, Call the labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and give them their hire; beginning from the laſt unto the firſt.</p>
               <p rend="small">8. <hi>Note</hi> Gods Reward is in the evening of our days, and the evening of the World; when Work is done.</p>
               <p n="9">9. And when they came that were hired at the Eleventh hour, they received every man a penny. 10. And when the firſt came, they ſuppoſed that they ſhould have received more, and they likewiſe received every man a penny. 11. And when they had received it, they murmured againſt the good man of the houſe. 12. Saying, Theſe laſt have wrought but one hour, and thou haſt made them equal with us, who have born the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and heat of the day.</p>

He made no difference in their Wages for the <hi>Time</hi> of their Work: But he will make difference for the <hi>Work it ſelf:</hi> They that are called, near the end of the World, ſhall have as much, as thoſe that heard Chriſt Preach: And thoſe that are Converted in their Age, if they be more Holy, than thoſe that began in Youth, will be more Happy. 2. This Parable meaneth not, that our Reward is <hi>Wages for the value of our Work</hi> as beneficial to God, in Commutative Juſtice; but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpeaketh of the proportion. 3. Nor doth it imply, That any in Heaven will murmur at other mens Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but that the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Diſciples were yet inclined to grudge, that the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were equalled with them. And it is to cure ſuch envy now.</p>
               <p n="13">13.14. But he anſwered one of them, and ſaid, Friend, I do thee no wrong; didſt thou not agree with me for a penny. Take that thine is and goe thy way: I will give to this laſt, even as unto thee: 15. Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with my own? Is thine eye evil becauſe I am good?</p>
               <p rend="small">13.14.15. I break no Covenant with thee: Thou art not meet to give me Laws of Equity: Liberality to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is no wrong to thee.

All ſhall have Equity, but all ſhall not have equal bounty. Thou ſhouldſt be glad of thy Brothers receivings.</p>

               <p rend="small">16. So the laſt called in time, may be made the Chief in Dignity; and the firſt called in time, may be in Grace and Glory among the loweſt.

               <p n="33">33. Hear another Parable: There was a certain houſholder who planted a Vineyard and hedged it round about, and digged a wine preſs in it, and built a town, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country.</p>
               <p rend="small">33. <hi>Note,</hi> God did what was neceſſary to have made the <hi>Jews</hi> a happy Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as to means prepared: By digging a Wine-preſs, is meant, hollowing a Trough to bruiſe the Grapes in, and building a Tower, is a Lodge, or Dwelling for the Workmen.</p>

               <p rend="small">1, 2, 3. The calling of men into the Church, is like a Kings inviting Gueſts to his Sons Marriage feaſt, that would not come.</p>

               <p rend="small">4. Chriſts Miniſters are oft to invite men, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune them to come in: and to tell them that Chriſt and his merits are ſufficient for them, and all is ready and done on his part, preparatory to their belief, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception and conſent: they ſhall not periſh for want of a ſufficient Sacrifice.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But they made light of it, and went their way; one to his farm, and another to his merchandize. 6. And the remnant took his ſervants, and intreated them ſhamefully and ſlew them.</p>
               <p rend="small">5, 6. <hi>Note,</hi> As did the Jews ſo do many others. <hi>make light of Chriſt,</hi> and all his offers of Grace and Glory, and mind more their Farms and Merchandize, their worldly intereſt and proſperity.

               <p rend="small">11, 12, <hi>N.</hi> Among the Jews the Marriages of rich men were ſolemnized with extraordinary pomp and feaſting, and by the <hi>Wedding</hi> or <hi>feſtival garment,</hi> is meant, true Faith and Repentance. <hi>N.</hi> 1.

               <p rend="small">15. The malicious Phariſees conſulted how to get ſome words from him, for which they might accuſe him.</p>
               <p n="16">16. And they ſent unto him their diſciples with the Herodians, ſaying, Maſter we know that thou art true, and teacheſt the way of God in truth, neither careſt thou for any man, for thou regardeſt not the perſon of men. 17.

               <p rend="small">16, 17. There were then two parties among the Jews: The King <hi>Herod's</hi> party who were for gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Tribute to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and the Phariſees party
<pb facs="tcp:66325:31"/>
that were againſt the right of it. And they ſought to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnare Chriſt, ſaying, It is the part of a Prophet not to fear man how great ſoever, but plainly to ſpeak the truth; and we know thou art ſuch an one: Therefore tell us, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p rend="small">
                  <hi>Note,</hi> That the Jews fell under the <hi>Roman</hi> Power, by diviſion, two brethren ſtriving for the principality. And one of them got the better by the <hi>Romans</hi> help, conſenting to be tributary under them: And his party (which ruled) were for this Tribute. But the party of the other Brother who was overcome, took them but for Uſurpers, and ſuch were the lower ſort, and many Phariſees. So that they thought to draw Chriſt either to fall under the <hi>Roman</hi> ſeverity, or to loſe the Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy, by his anſwer. (A way of enſnaring not yet ended.)</p>
               <p n="18">18. But Jeſus perceived their wickedneſs, and ſaid, Why tempt ye me ye hypocrites<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 19. Shew me the tribute money? and they brought him a peny. 20. And he ſaith to them, Whoſe is this image and ſuperſcripti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on? 21. They ſay to him, Ceſars: Then ſaith he to them, Render therefore to Ceſar the things that are Ceſars, and to God the things that are Gods.</p>

               <p rend="small">
                  <hi>Note,</hi> That they are three diſtinct queſtions. 1. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be lawful to pay tribute to <hi>Ceſar,</hi> as being an owning of his power? 2. Whether it be a duty, and, 3. Whether <hi>Ceſar</hi> had true right to demand it? And Chriſt was deſired to anſwer the firſt: And he had taught his Diſciples how lawful it was for peace to give away their right: much more now doth he intimate this to be lawfull for publick peace and ſafety. 2. And the ſecond queſtion is by intimation reſolved in the firſt; For if it be lawful, publick peace will make it a duty. But he anſwereth ſo cautelouſly as not to reſolve the third queſtion, Whether <hi>Ceſar</hi> had right, or were an Uſurper, and ſo avoided their ſnare. Some think that <hi>Hircanus</hi> dedition to the <hi>Romans</hi> gave them right, and others think he repreſented not the Nation. And ſome think that many years poſſeſſion gave him right, and others ſay that meer poſſeſſion without right groweth not to right by time. And ſome think that the Jews ſo long uſing <hi>Ceſars</hi> Coyn and Officers, ſignified conſent, and gave him right. And others ſay, That this alone ſignified but Submiſſion or Non-reſiſtance, through diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability and not ſubjection or conſent to Government. If <hi>Ceſar</hi> were an Uſurper, paying tribute owned not his right, any more than contribution to conquering Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; A man may buy his life or peace of a Robber. But Chriſt ſeemeth to anſwer but to the queſtion askt him, and not to meddle with any more.</p>
               <p rend="small">
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> The Tax intended in the queſtion, was that which <hi>Ceſar</hi> alienated from the Temple, and therefore the meaning was (Is it not Sacriledge to pay that to <hi>Ceſar</hi> that ſhould be paid to God.) <hi>Anſ.</hi> And Chriſts anſwer is perfectly ſuited to ſuch a queſtion: as if he had ſaid, (without determining <hi>Ceſars</hi> right to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern them.) You need not ask whether you ſhall pay it to God or to <hi>Ceſar</hi>: You may do both if you are able: Pay <hi>Ceſar</hi> that which is <hi>Ceſars,</hi> and give God neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs his due.</p>
               <p n="22">22. When they had heard theſe words, they marvelled, and left him, and went their way.</p>
               <p rend="small">22. When they ſaw they could not enſnare him, they went away confounded and diſappointed</p>
               <p n="23">23. The ſame day came to him the Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducees, which ſay there is no reſurrection, and asked him, 24. Saying, Maſter, Moſes ſaid, If a man die, having no children, his brother ſhall marry his wife, and raiſe up ſeed to his brother. 25. Now there were with us ſeven brethren, and the firſt when he had married a wife, deceaſed, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no iſſue, left his wife unto his brother. 26. Likewiſe the ſecond alſo, and the third, to the ſeventh, 27. And laſt of all the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man died alſo. 28. Therefore in the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, whoſe wife ſhall ſhe be?</p>
               <p rend="small">23, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe Sadducees were Hereticks that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved no life after this, nor Angels nor Spirits, and yet profeſſed to believe the five Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and ſo pretended <hi>Moſes</hi> words to countenance their fooliſh error.</p>
               <p n="29">29. Jeſus anſwered and ſaid to them, Ye do err, not knowing the ſcriptures, nor the power of God. 30. For in the reſurrection they neither marry nor are given in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, but are as the Angels of God in heaven.</p>
               <p rend="small">29, 30. You err through the ignorance of your groſs and carnal minds, and carnally miſunderſtand the Scriptures, and the nature and power of God, and ſo of Spiritual things. In the life after this they have not fleſh and bloud that luſteth and generateth as here; but they are Spiritual ſubſtances like the Angels in Heaven that generate not.</p>
               <p n="31">31. But as touching the reſurrection of the dead, have ye not read that which was ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to you by God, ſaying, 32. I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Iſaac, and the God of Jacob: God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.</p>
               <p rend="small">31, 32. That there is a life after this, is proved by Gods words: I am the God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That <hi>God is their God,</hi> implyeth that they are his people, and therefore live: For to be <hi>Their God,</hi> is to be their Ruler and their Benefactor and felicity; a relation which the dead are not capable of. And it is not ſaid, <hi>I was their God,</hi> but, <hi>I am their God.</hi> And if <hi>Abraham, &amp;c.</hi> be alive, ſo are the ſouls of other men; and as they die not with the

body, but live with Spirits, So they are capable of a Spiritual body which God will give them.</p>
               <p rend="small">
                  <hi>Note,</hi> It is well noted by Dr.<hi>Hammond,</hi> that as the Sadducees denied not only the riſing of the body, but the Immortality of the Soul, and all our life after this, ſo it was this future life which they here meant, and Chriſt doth prove out of the books which they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: And that <gap reason="foreign">

               <p n="34">34. But when the Phariſees had heard that he had put the Sadducees to ſilence, they were gathered together. 35.

               <p n="1">1. AND Jeſus went out and departed from the Temple, and his Diſciples came to him for to ſhew him the buildings of the Temple. 2. And Jeſus ſaid to them, See ye not all theſe things? Verily I ſay to you, There ſhall not be left here one ſtone upon another that ſhall not be thrown down.</p>
               <p rend="small">1.2. All this ſhall be caſt down for the Sin of this People.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And as he ſate on the mount of Olives, his diſciples came to him privately, ſaying, Tell us, when ſhall theſe things be? and what ſhall be the ſign of thy coming, and of the end of the world.</p>
               <p rend="small">3. They deſired him that had ſo oft told them, that he muſt be Crucifyed, and Riſe again, and yet come again, to tell them the meaning, and ſigns of this his coming, which they did not well underſtand. Some Expoſitors of this hard Chapter think, That the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on meaneth no more, than [what ſhall be the Signs of thy Coming to Deſtroy <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>; and of the end of their Policie. Others think, That they expected that Chriſt ſhould preſently come, and Reign at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and ſet up a Kingdom ſo excellent, as ſhould be the beginning of a New Age, or World; as <hi>Noahs</hi> after the Deluge, when all the World of wicked men ſhould ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to him or be deſtroyed. Others ſay, That theſe queſtions are put of different things, and times, and accordingly Anſwered, 1. When the Temple ſhould be Deſtroyed? 2. When Chriſt would ſet up his Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Kingdome. 3. When the World ſhould End? The two firſt undoubtedly they meant; but by his <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> I do not think they meant, either his ſending the <hi>Roman</hi> Army, nor his Coming at the Day of Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Judgment; but his Coming to be a Viſible Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, and Declaring himſelf King, and Reigning ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly. And 3. By the <hi>End of the World,</hi> whether they meant the utter Deſolation at laſt, or the End of the Unreformed, Age, or World, which his Kingdom ſhould overthrow, I am not certain. And though Chriſt do not preſently blame their miſ-expectations, his Anſwers approve them not, but tend to rectifie them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And Jeſus anſwered, and ſaid to them, Take heed that no man deceive you. 5. For many ſhall come in my name, ſaying, I am Chriſt, and ſhall deceive many.</p>
               <p rend="small">4.5. Its true, that this Temple ſhall be deſtroyed, and my Kingdom ſhall be ſet up, and the world of Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies be ſubdued, (and that of Nature be diſſolved.) But for your Queſtion of the time, let me firſt admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh you to be fortified by Patience and Faith, againſt many Deceivers, that will for tryal be permitted to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, that not I, but they are the true Meſſiah: (ſuch were <hi>Simon, Doſitheas, Theudas,</hi>) and look not for a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Monarch.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And ye ſhall hear of wars, and rumours of wars, ſee that ye be not troubled; for all theſe things muſt come to paſs, but the end is not yet.</p>
               <p rend="small">6. There will be fearful Commotions, Riſings, and Wars, before theſe things come to paſs; Let not that diſturb you.</p>
               <p n="7">7.8. For nation ſhall riſe againſt nation, and kingdom againſt kingdom, and there ſhall be famines, and peſtilences, and earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes in divers places. All theſe are the beginning of ſorrows.</p>
               <p rend="small">7.8. Wars by ſedition among your ſelves, and Wars of other Nations, with other Plagues and Commotions, and Signes, ſhall be but fore-runners of that ſorrowful time.</p>

               <p rend="small">9. And before that day fore-know, what ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall your ſelves: Perſecution, Murder, and common Hatred, for my Name ſake.</p>
               <p n="10">10. And then many ſhall be offended, and ſhall betray one another, and ſhall hate one another.</p>
               <p rend="small">10. And the temptations of thoſe days ſhall prevail againſt many that profeſſed Faith, and ſhall pervert them, and draw them to betray, and hate my true Diſciples, and ſhew their unfaithfulneſs.</p>
               <p n="11">11. And many falſe prophets ſhall riſe, and ſhall deceive many.</p>
               <p rend="small">11. And many that make themſelves the Maſters of Sects and Hereſies, ſhall pretend Inſpiration, and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation for Lies, and pernicious Doctrines; and many ſhall be deceived and follow them.</p>
               <p n="12">12. And becauſe iniquity ſhall abound the love of many ſhall wax cold.</p>
               <p rend="small">12. And iniquity ſhall ſo far abound, both in the World aſſaulting the Church, and in the declining of Church Members (by Worldlineſs, Fleſhlineſs, Pride, and Hereſie,) that the firſt fervours of Chriſtian Love ſhall be abated.</p>
               <p n="13">13. But he that ſhall endure to the end, the ſame ſhall be ſaved.</p>
               <p rend="small">13. But he that overcometh theſe Temptations, and keepeth his Integrity, and perſevereth in his Fidelity, ſhall attain the end of his Faith, and be Saved.</p>
               <p n="14">14. And this goſpel of the kingdom ſhall be preached in all the world, for a witneſs to all nations, and then ſhall the end come.</p>
               <p rend="small">14. And the <hi>Jews</hi> driving you away by Perſecution, you ſhall Preach the Goſpel to the <hi>Heathen</hi> Nations, who by receiving it, ſhall condemn the <hi>Jews</hi>: And then ſhall come the deſolation of their State, and the ending of their Law and Policie.</p>

And I incline to think, that as the Types and Prophecies of the Old Teſtament, ſpake proximately of the <hi>things</hi> and <hi>perſons</hi> Typifying, but remotely and chiefly thereby of Chriſt, and the things Typifyed: ſo theſe Texts ſpeak, firſt of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>; and next, of the Calling of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and Catholick Church; but thereby finally and chiefly, of the End of the World: As if Chriſt ſaid, As it will be here now, ſo it will be then, paraboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally.</p>

                  <hi>Annotation,</hi> It is of great moment, for the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of this Chapter, and much of Chriſts Goſpel, to know the true meaning of <hi>Chriſts Kingdom,</hi> and his <hi>Coming.</hi> Tho oft he ſpake directly of his laſt coming to Judgment; yet ordinarily this ſeemeth his meaning. His Kingdom is that Reign in Heaven on Earth at once which he was to exerciſe as the Meſſiah, or God Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, having Redeemed loſt Man. The little poor Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were his <hi>peculiar People before</hi>: Upon his Aſcenſion, the <hi>Gentile</hi> World was to be Called, and a Catholick Church gathered over the Earth, in a more excellent covenant of peculiarity; and this Catholick Church, is the Kingdom of the Meſſiah: His coming, is not his ſending his Enemies to deſtroy <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>; nor yet his Viſible Appearance in Perſon, (till Judgment,) but his ſetting up this his Kingdom: his coming to Reign, that is, to Erect this Catholick Church: This is plainly expounded, in <hi>Luke</hi> 17.20, 21, 23. The <hi>Phariſees</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, when the Kingdom of God ſhould come? He told them, The Kingdom of God cometh not with obſervation, or outward ſhew, (by perſonal viſible Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of the King, in Pomp and Splendor with a Court, as Monarchs rule) nor ſhall they ſay, Lo here, or Lo there; (No Head, King, or Court ſhall be Viſible:) for behold, the Kingdom of God is in you, (or among you:) It is a Spiritual Reign in Souls, and in the Church; of which you have already ſome beginnings. 24. For as the Lightning that Lightneth out of one part under the Heaven, ſhineth to the other part under Heaven; So ſhall alſo the Son of man be in his Day: but firſt he muſt ſuffer and be rejected of this Generation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that is, when he hath Suffered, and been Rejected, he will Riſe, Aſcend, and from Heaven ſend his Spirit and Word to enlighten the World from Eaſt to Weſt, and call a Catholick Church amongſt the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and this is his Kingdom and Reign; And this Generation ſhall not paſs, till this Catholick Church be thus gathered, though not perfected: What elſe can be meant by Chriſts many Parables, that the Kingdom of God, is like a grain of Muſtard Seed. A little Leaven hid in Meal. A Field ſown, that after had Tares. A Net caſt inro the Sea, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> When the Catholick Church was made, Chriſts Kingdom came, and when his Kingdom came, he came as King to Govern it, by his Spirit, Word, and Miniſters, <hi>Matth,</hi> 21.43. The Kingdom of God, (that is, the Church State of peculiarity) ſhall be taken from you, and given to a Nation (the <hi>Gentile</hi> word) bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth the Fruit thereof: But the Perfection of the Kingdom will be at laſt. And as to the Time of his Appearing for Judgment, it muſt ſpecially be obſerved, that he tells them, That it was not known either to Angels, or to himſelf. And if Chriſt knew it not, (as man,) how preſumptuous are they that foretel it. And whereas they ſay, It was but the <hi>Day</hi> and the <hi>Hour,</hi> and not the <hi>Year,</hi> that he knew not? I anſwer, That by <hi>Day</hi> and <hi>Hour,</hi> is meant in general <hi>The Time.</hi> And if Chriſt knew it not, no wonder if he foretold it not to his Diſciples, but told them, <hi>It ſhall be uncertain to you,</hi> that you may be always ready: Therefore, though it be falſe that <hi>Grotius</hi> ſaith, That <hi>Paul</hi> thought, that the Coming of Chriſt would be in his days; It is true, that <hi>Paul</hi> knew not but that it might be in his Days. They might know indeed, that it would not be, till certain Signes foretold, came to paſs; but after that, they were ſtill to expect it as uncertain.</p>

               <p n="1">1. THen ſhall the kingdom of heaven be likened to ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom. 2. And five of them were wiſe, and five were fooliſh.</p>
               <p rend="small">1. When Chriſt cometh to Judgment, (either on the <hi>Jews</hi> as aforeſaid, or on any with Death; or on all, at the laſt Day,) the Adminiſtration of his Kingly Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, towards the Ready, and Unready may be illuſtrated by this ſimilitude, of Ten Virgins, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p rend="small">
                  <hi>Note,</hi> The Cuſtome of the <hi>Jews</hi> was, to make very Pompous Feaſts, at Weddings, and many Virgins uſed to go to the Brides Houſe, and thence with hand Lamps to go, and attend her to the Wedding.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They that were fooliſh, took their
<pb facs="tcp:66325:35"/>
Lamps, and took no oyl with them. 4. But the wiſe took oyl in their veſſels with their Lamps.</p>
               <p rend="small">3.4. The Fooliſh made no preparation but for the preſent, but the Wiſe provided for the time to come, ſuppoſing there might be ſome delay.</p>
               <p rend="small">
                  <hi>Note,</hi> The Parable is, to ſtir up all to preparation for Death and Judgment; and all the Tryals that are to come: and to prove it damning Fooliſhneſs after all warnings to delay, and be unprepared.</p>
               <p n="5">5. While the bridegroom tarried, they all ſlumbred and ſlept.</p>
               <p rend="small">5. <hi>Note,</hi> The Lamp, and the Veſſel of Oyl ſignifie, Preparation by <hi>ſudden act,</hi> and Preparation by a <hi>ſtated habit:</hi> Wiſe, and Fooliſh, Good, and Bad, may ſleep up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on delay; and keep not up ſtill the ſame lively Activi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: But the Godly have ſtill the holy Nature and Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And at mid-night there was a cry made, Behold, the bridgroom cometh, Go ye out to meet him.</p>
               <p rend="small">6. And when they are deepeſt in ſecurity, or forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, and minding Worldly things, they ſuddenly hear that Chriſt by Death or Judgment is coming; He is juſt at hand: There's no more delay, you muſt preſently come away to Judgment, and to be ſaved if you are his.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Then all thoſe virgins aroſe, and trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med their lamps.</p>
               <p rend="small">7. When the Midnight cry cometh, and there is no longer ſtay, all men good and bad, wiſe and fooliſh, will be awakened, to attempt ſome ſudden preparation: The worſt almoſt under the ſentence of Death will think, what now muſt I do to be Saved: ſelf-love, and fear, will make them cry for Mercy, with ſome kind of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, though they be Unconverted.</p>
               <p n="8">8. And the fooliſh ſaid to the wiſe, Give us of your oyl for our lamps are out.</p>
               <p rend="small">8. The unprepared unholy Souls, when Death and Judgment comes, would fain then be found in the State of holy Believers, and would die the death of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, and wiſh for their preparations.</p>
               <p n="9">9. But the wiſe anſwered, ſaying, Not ſo: leſt there be not enough for us and you, but go ye rather to them that ſell, and buy for your ſelves.</p>
               <p rend="small">9. Theſe wiſhes then are vain: One man cannot be Saved by another mans Righteouſneſs: It muſt be your own, or it will not ſave you. Go therefore and make your own preparation.</p>
               <p n="10">10. And while they went to buy, the bride-groom came, and they that were ready<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> went in with him to the marriage; and the door was ſhut.</p>
               <p rend="small">10. Death and Judgment will not ſtay for the unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: They that then are found unſanctified, onely under fears and wiſhes to be ſaved, will be ſhut out, when ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prepared Souls are all let in.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Afterwards came alſo the other vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, ſaying, Lord, Lord, open to us.</p>
               <p rend="small">11. Self-love and fear, will make the unholy Cry in vain, too late for Mercy.</p>
               <p n="12">12. But he anſwered and ſaid, Verily I ſay unto you, I know you not.</p>
               <p rend="small">12. But he will not own, or open to ſuch ſeekers, but reject them. <hi>N.</hi> Not that true Converſion and Holineſs is ever too late. But thoſe fears and crys for Mercy, which in time might have been good preparations for a true Change, may be all loſt, and come ſhort of it at the laſt extremity.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Watch therefore, for ye know nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the day nor the hour, when the Son of man cometh.</p>
               <p rend="small">13. God hath purpoſely concealed the time of Chriſts Coming from the knowledge of all Men, that all might be obliged to be in conſtant watchful readineſs: yea, it is ſaid, That Chriſt himſelf knew it not as man, They that ſay, The Year may be known, though not the Day, or Hour; diſtort the Text which meaneth, by <hi>Day</hi> and <hi>Hour,</hi> the <hi>Time</hi>: as if he had ſaid, You are not ſure (ſave by the Signes forementioned not Fulfilled) but it may be the next Day, or Hour: ſo that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles themſelves were uncertain, tho they rebuked them that pretended to know, that it was at hand, before <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> was Deſtroyed. From their days till now, God hath kept the Church uncertain, but that it might quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly come. So that <hi>Grotius</hi> is miſtaken, that thinks <hi>Paul</hi> believed it would be in his days; as if he had by a falſe Motive drawn men to godlineſs: But <hi>Paul</hi> knew not how ſoon it might have come. Ignorance of it is needful; but Error is hurtful: (of which before.)</p>
               <p n="14">14. For the kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a far countrey, who called his own ſervants, and delivered unto them his goods: 15. And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one, to every man according to his ſeveral ability, and ſtairway took his Journey.</p>
               <p rend="small">14.15. Chriſt paſſing into the Heavens, committeth to his Servants the Word, means, and mercies of his Grace, that they may improve them till he come by Death and Judgment, to call them to account; Not giving the ſame degree of means and mercy to all, but to ſome more, and to ſome leſs.</p>
               <p n="16">16. Then he that had received the five talents, went and traded with the ſame, and made them other five talents. 17. And like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he that had received two, he alſo gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed other two.</p>
               <p rend="small">16.17. They that had the greater means and helps improved them, to their own increaſe of Grace, and the good of others, and the ſervice and honour of their Lord.</p>
               <p n="18">18. But he that had received one, went and digged in the earth, and hid his lords money.</p>
               <p rend="small">
                  <pb facs="tcp:66325:36"/>18. <hi>Note,</hi> Tho the leaſt helps ſhould be anſwerably improved, yet the leſs (ſuch as thoſe have, who have little more than the Light of Nature) excite not men ſo powerfully to an improvement.</p>
               <p n="19">19. After a long time, the Lord of thoſe ſervants cometh and reckoneth with them.</p>
               <p rend="small">19. <hi>Note,</hi> Chriſt here intimateth that hiscoming to reckon with them would not be haſty.</p>
               <p n="20">20. And lo he that had received five ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents came and brought other five talents, ſaying, Lord, thou deliveredſt to me five talents, behold, I have gained beſides them five talents more.</p>
               <p rend="small">20. I have uſed them to the increaſe of thy grace in me, and to the good of men, and to thy Glory.</p>
               <p n="21">21. His Lord ſaid to him, Well done thou good and faithful ſervant, thou haſt been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things, enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.</p>
               <p rend="small">21. His Lord who freely gave him his talents to uſe, yet rewarded his faithful uſage of them, and praiſed his fidelity, ſaying, I will give thee great things, becauſe thou haſt well and faithfully uſed the ſmaller mercies of this life which I gave thee.</p>
               <p n="22">22. He alſo that had received two talents came and ſaid, Lord, thou deliveredſt to me two talents, behold I have gained two other talents beſides them. 23. His Lord ſaid to him, Well done thou good and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſervant, thou haſt been faithful over a few things, I will make the ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.</p>
               <p rend="small">22, 23. <hi>N.</hi> 1. The reward of Glory given for our diligent improvement of the mercies of this life, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the freeneſs of the gift. 2. God himſelf will praiſe the fidelity of his Servants, as worthy of praiſe. 3. Great rewards will crown the Faithful for little things here ſincerely done. 4. It is our Lords own joy that the faithful ſhall enter partake of.</p>
               <p n="24">24. Then he which had received the one talent came and ſaid, Lord, I knew thee that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou haſt not ſown, and gathering where thou haſt not ſtrewed: 25. And I was afraid and went and hid thy talent in the ground, Lo, there thou haſt that is thine.</p>
               <p rend="small">24, 25. The fear of thy ſeverity made me think it ſafeſt to keep thy Money merely from being loſt.</p>
               <p rend="small">
                  <hi>N.</hi> Hard thoughts of God makes men backward to his ſervice, which is a work of Love; and ſinful fear is an enemy to holy diligence and fruitfulneſs.</p>
               <p n="26">26. His Lord anſwered and ſaid to him, Thou wicked and ſlothful ſervant, thou kneweſt that I reap where I ſowed not, and gather where <hi>I</hi> have not ſtrewed. 27. Thou oughteſt therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, and then at my coming I ſhould have received my own with u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury.</p>
               <p rend="small">26, 27. <hi>Note,</hi> 1. God will take a ſlothful ſervant for a wicked ſervant: unprofitableneſs and omiſſion of duty, is damnable unfaithfulneſs in us that are but Stewards and Servants. To do no harm is a praiſe fit for a ſtone and not for a man. 2. To confeſs Gods holy Government, and yet to be unholy, is to be ſelf-condemning.</p>
               <p rend="small">
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> Doth this Text juſtifie uſury? <hi>Anſ.</hi> It ſpeaketh of that ſort of increaſe made by exchange and trading, without reproof, and with ſeeming approbation. Gain by Trading and Merchandize is one ſort of Uſury: all Uſury is unlawful which is againſt <hi>Juſtice</hi> or <hi>Charity.</hi> And all other is lawful; and ſome that is a work of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is to ſome a duty.</p>
               <p n="28">28. Take therefore the talent from him, and give it to him which hath ten talents. 29. For to every one that hath ſhall be given, and he ſhall have abundance; but from him that hath not, ſhall be taken away, even that which he hath.</p>
               <p rend="small">28, 29. He ſhall be deprived of the mercies of this life, who improved them not for a better life, when he that ſo improved them ſhall have an abundant reward, the mercies of this life and that to come.</p>
               <p n="30">30. And caſt ye the unprofitable ſervant into outer darkneſs, there ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of teeth.</p>
               <p rend="small">30. <hi>N.</hi> 1. Omiſſion and unprofitableneſs is damning ſin. 2. Hell is called <hi>Fire</hi> for pain, and <hi>Darkneſs</hi> for uncomfortableneſs.</p>
               <p n="31">31. When the Son of man ſhall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then ſhall he ſit upon the throne of his glory: 32. And before him ſhall be gathered all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and he ſhall ſeparate them one from another, as a ſhepherd divideth his ſheep from the goats. 33. And he ſhall ſet the ſheep on his right hand, and the goats on his left.</p>
               <p rend="small">31, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The coming of Chriſt ſhall be in Glory, with all his holy Angels, who ſerved him here for the good of his Elect; and as Judge he ſhall ſit on his Throne of Glory: And all perſons and Nations ſhall be called by him to Judgment, and he ſhall ſeparate them as ſheep and goats, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="34">34. Then ſhall the King ſay to them on his right hand, Come ye bleſſed of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

               <p n="35">35. For I was hungry and ye gave me meat, I was thirſty and ye gave me drink, I was a ſtranger and ye took me in: 36. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and ye cloathed me, I was ſick, and ye viſited me, I was in priſon and ye came to me.</p>
               <p rend="small">35, 36. <hi>N.</hi> 1. Theſe works are noted as the effects of Faith and Love, without which they would have been but <hi>dead works.</hi> 2.

And thus all are judged (that is, finally juſtified or condemned) according to their works, as judged by the Law of Grace and Faith, and not by <hi>Moſes</hi> Law or that of Innocency. 3.

               <p rend="small">45. <hi>N.</hi> The wicked ſhall ſuffer not only for hurting, but for not helping the faithful, as if it had been Chriſt himſelf that they neglected. O what a motive is this to Charity?</p>

                  <hi>Qu.</hi> Will it not be endleſs thus to convince and judge all the world? <hi>Anſ.</hi> No: though this be ſpoken after the manner of Men, God can at once open every mans caſe to his own Conſcience, and judge all the world in a moment, as the Sun doth at once enlighten all the eyes on earth.</p>
               <p n="46">46. And theſe ſhall go away into ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting puniſhment, and the righteous into life eternal.</p>

               <p n="1">1. ANd it came to paſs when Jeſus had finiſhed all theſe ſayings, he ſaid to his diſciples, 2. Ye know that after two days
<pb facs="tcp:66325:37"/>
is the paſſover, and the Son of man is betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be crucified.</p>
               <p rend="small">1, 2. <hi>N.</hi> Chriſt went not ignorantly or conſtrained to his death, but willing and foreknowing it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Then aſſembled together the chief prieſts, and the ſcribes, and the elders of the People, unto the palace of the high prieſt, who was called Caiaphas. 4. And conſulted how they might take Jeſus by ſubtilty, and kill him. 5. But they ſaid, Not on the feaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, leſt there be an uproar among the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
               <p rend="small">3, <hi>&amp;c. N.</hi> 1. The chief Men, Prieſts and Rulers were the chief Murderers. 2. Its a wonder that the people were not deſtroyed as Seditious Rebels, rather than feared by ſuch Rulers; when they would have reſiſted or ſtoned them that had aſſaulted Chriſt, or a Prophet.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Now when Jeſus was in Bethany, in the houſe of Simon the leper. 7. There came to him a woman, having an alabaſter box of very precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he ſat at meat. 8. But when his diſciples ſaw it, they had indignation, ſaying, To what purpoſe is this waſt? 9. For this ointment might have been ſold for much, and given to the poor.</p>
               <p rend="small">6, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 1. It being uſual at great feaſts in the Country to anoint, ſhe ſignified by this her great love and hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to Chriſt. 2. <hi>Judas</hi> was the chief murmurer, but perhaps ſome others might object.</p>
               <p n="10">10. When Jeſus underſtood it, he ſaid unto them, Why trouble ye the Woman? for ſhe hath wrought a good work on me. 11. For ye have the poor always with you, but me ye have not always. 12. For in that ſhe hath poured this ointment on my body<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhe did it to my burial.</p>
               <p rend="small">10, <hi>&amp;c. N.</hi> Tho works of Charity to the poor are highly eſteemed by Chriſt, and preferred before many rites and ſmaller matters, yet ſome works of piety muſt be preferred before them. And that duty may in its ſeaſon be greater, which is not ſo at another time.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Verily I ſay to you, Whereſoever this goſpel ſhall be preached in the whole World, there ſhall alſo this, that this wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man hath done, be told for a memorial of her.</p>
               <p rend="small">13. <hi>N.</hi> 1. How highly Chriſt valueth the true love and coſtly piety of the meaneſt! 2. Chriſt knew and decreed that the Goſpel or Hiſtory of his Life, Death, and Burial, and Reſurrection ſhould be preached throughout the world, yea and written to: The words in <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. [<hi>Let him that readeth underſtand</hi>] ſeem to be Chriſts own words, and to imply that all thoſe his words ſhould be written; at leaſt we may well an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer them that ask, Where did Chriſt Command them to write the Scripture? that 1. His Spirit in them commanded it. 2. <hi>Writing is but the moſt publike ſort of Preaching.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="14">14. Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iſcariot, went unto the chief Prieſts. 15. And ſaid to them, what will ye give me, and I will deliver him unto you? And they cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted with him for thirty pieces of ſilver. 16. And from that time he ſought opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to betray him.</p>
               <p rend="small">14, 15, 16. <hi>N.</hi> Chriſt knowingly permitted an Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite in the Apoſtleſhip, and to betray him, to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell us that Covetous falſhearted Hypocrites will be in the Viſible Church; and will betray it. 2. Covetous love of Money is the root of treachery in Hypocrite Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and others. 3. <hi>Judas</hi>'s ſin was not by a ſudden Paſſion, but deliberate: contrived and contracted (for three pound fifteen Shillings.)</p>
               <p n="17">17. Now the firſt day of the feaſt of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leavened bread, the diſciples came to Jeſus, ſaying, where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the paſſover?</p>
               <p rend="small">17. On the fifth day of the week called now <hi>Thurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> at eventide, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="18">18. And he ſaid, Go into the City to ſuch a man, and ſay to him, the Maſter ſaith, My time is at hand, I will keep the paſſover at thy houſe with my diſciples.</p>
               <p rend="small">18. <hi>N.</hi> As to the great controverſies here, whether Chriſt and the Jews did eate the paſſover the ſame day, and whether Chriſt did eate the <hi>Paſchal Lamb,</hi> or only the <hi>unleavened bread</hi> and <hi>bitter herbs</hi>; which was the beginning of the paſſover, being to have eaten the Lamb at the next evening, if he had not been Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed himſelf. I leave the diſcuſſion of them to Commentators, who handle them at large, not troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ordinary Readers with them.</p>
               <p n="19">19. And the diſciples did as Jeſus had appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them, and made ready the paſſover. 20. Now when the even was come, he ſat down with the twelve. 21. And as they did eat, he ſaid, Verily I ſay to you, that one of you ſhall betray me. 22. And they were exceeding ſorrowfull, and began every one of them to ſay to him, Lord, is it I? 23. And he anſwered and ſaid, He that dippeth his hand with me in the diſh, the ſame ſhall betray me.</p>
               <p rend="small">19, <hi>&amp;c. N.</hi> 1. Chriſt being under the Law was to keep the Law of the Paſſover. 2. The innocent Diſciples were troubled both at the tidings of the thing, and that they ſhould be under ſuſpicion.</p>
               <p n="24">24. The Son of man goeth as it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb facs="tcp:66325:37"/>
of him: but wo to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed: it had been good for that man, if he had not been born.</p>
               <p rend="small">24. <hi>N.</hi> Gods decree to bring good out of mens evil, extenſuateth not mens ſin or puniſhment; the eſcaping of a <hi>Greater evil,</hi> is here called [<hi>Good</hi>] not in itſelf, but <hi>to that Man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="25">25. Then Judas, anſwered and ſaid, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter is it I? He ſaid to him, Thou haſt ſaid.</p>
               <p rend="small">25. <hi>N. Judas</hi> was before reſolved and hardened; ſo that this notice did not ſtop him from the ſin.</p>
               <p n="26">26. And as they were eating, Jeſus took bread, and bleſſed it, and brake it, and gave it to the diſciples, and ſaid, Take, eat, this is my body.</p>
               <p rend="small">26. <hi>N.</hi> 1. This <hi>bread</hi> was unleavened, and part of the Paſſover. 2. The <hi>bleſſing</hi> it, was the Separating it to this holy uſe, and praying God to bleſs it, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing it bleſt. 3. The <hi>breaking</hi> it, ſignified the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſts Body, repreſented hereby as the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for ſin. 4. The <hi>giving</hi> it, ſignifieth the giving him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, to believing receivers; with and for their ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and everlaſting life. For the Sacrament as Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred hath theſe three parts. 1. The <hi>Conſecration,</hi> 2. <hi>The Commemoration,</hi> or <hi>Repreſentation,</hi> 3. <hi>The Communication</hi> 5. [<hi>This is my Body</hi>] meaneth [<hi>This is my ſacrificed body repreſentative.</hi>] When it is <hi>Conſecrated</hi> it is not to be <hi>called</hi> [<hi>Bread</hi>] that is, mere bread, for it hath now another <hi>form,</hi> and <hi>forma denominat; But it is</hi> only a <hi>Relative form</hi>: If you ask what matter it hath, It is <hi>Bread ſtill</hi>; If you ask <hi>what form,</hi> it is Chriſt Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Body. As if you ask of the Kings <hi>Coyne,</hi> what is it, it is in General <hi>Money,</hi> particularly this or that piece of Money<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The anſwer is not, it is <hi>Silver</hi> or <hi>Gold,</hi> for that ſpeaketh not the <hi>Form.</hi> But if you ask what Metal it is made of, <hi>it is Silver or Gold,</hi> ſo is it here.</p>
               <p rend="small">6. It is not Chriſts Body as Glorified in Heaven that is repreſented in the Sacrament, but as Crucified fleſh. The ſecond council of Nice with the foregoing Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Council at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> agree that Chriſts body in Heaven is not <hi>fleſh,</hi> (though they differ about Images.) Fleſh and blood enter not there, but Spiritual bodies; it is not fleſh if it conſiſt not of fibrous Coagulated blood and Chyme made of food; which is not there.</p>
               <p rend="small">7. But it is the <hi>true body of Chriſt</hi> that was firſt <hi>of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to God</hi> in ſacrifice, and as ſuch <hi>Given to believing</hi> receivers ſo far as to be theirs in Relation of Myſtical union, and the Meritorious cauſe of their pardon, grace and glory.</p>
               <p rend="small">8. What a novel monſter the fiction of Tranſſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation is? I have fully opened in a little Treatiſe called [<hi>full and eaſy Satisfaction what is the true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</hi>] 9. The Circumſtances of Chriſts action are occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſional and no Laws for us: As are 1. Giving it at a Paſſover, 2. At the end of a meal, 3. At ſupper, or at night, 4. In an Inn or Gueſt Chamber, 5. To none but his family, 6. To none but men, 7. To none but Miniſters, 8. In an upper room, 9. Lying along in each others boſoms, 10. But once in his life, 11. Giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to all at once and not one by one (tho that ſeem of more importance than the reſt) 12. Delivering the bread before he gave thanks over the Cup, and not over both at once: (tho no doubt theſe may ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be imitated.</p>
               <p rend="small">9. Whether <hi>Judas</hi> was preſent or not is uncertain, (and of no doctrinal moment) if he were, and Chriſt alſo waſht his feet with the reſt, it ſhewed his obdurateneſs that could go preſently forth to betray him. Doubtleſs if wicked Hypocrites intrude, the ſin and puniſhment is only their own, ſo be it we ſin not by neglecting diſcipline; for the Keyes are given to the Paſtors to keep out men proved uncapable by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitence.</p>
               <p n="27">27. And he took the cup, and gave thanks and gave it to them, ſaying, Drink ye all of this. 28. For this is my blood of the new Teſtament, which is ſhed for many, for the remiſſion of ſins.</p>
               <p rend="small">27, 28. <hi>N.</hi> Giving to one by one is not Neceſſary. 2. The evangeliſts ſpeak not all the ſame words in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing Chriſts adminiſtration. <hi>Matthew</hi> hath no more but [<hi>This is my Body</hi>] nor <hi>Mark</hi> neither; leaving out [<hi>Which is given for you</hi>] as <hi>Luke</hi> hath it, or [<hi>Which is broken for you</hi>] as <hi>Paul</hi> hath it [<hi>Do this in Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of me.</hi>] And of the Cup, there are different words of <hi>Matthew, Mark, Luke,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi>; and <hi>Mark</hi> mentioneth their drinking it before Chriſts words [<hi>This is my blood of the New Teſtament,</hi> &amp;c.] But what is not ſpoken by one is by another, and the ſence is the ſame; and it tells us that if ſuch a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence be in our adminiſtration it nullifieth not the Sacrament.</p>
               <p rend="small">28. [This wine is repreſentatively or Sacramental<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly my blood ſhed (not as that of the Paſchal Lamb, for Jews only to ſeal that Old Covenant of their pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity, but) for the Gentiles alſo or the world, to purchaſe and ſeal the Univerſal Covenant of Grace, which giveth free pardon and life to all true believing accepters.</p>
               <p n="29">29. But I ſay unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, till that day when I drink it new with you in my Fathers kingdom.</p>
               <p rend="small">29. Two difficulties here ariſe, 1. Did not Chriſt drink with them after his reſurrection? <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1.

Others, ſay it meaneth [<hi>Shortly I ſhall leave you, and drink no more with you.</hi>] 4. Others probably think he meant [<hi>I ſhall no more keep a Paſſover</hi> or <hi>Sacrament with you.</hi>]</p>
               <p rend="small">2. The other difficulty is, How he will drink of it in the Kingdom of his Father. 1. Some ſay, Literally after the Reſurrection on Earth. 2. Some ſay, that a thouſand years before the end of the World; all things ſhall be reſtored to the primitive Paradiſe ſtate, and Chriſt raigning on Earth, ſhall drink of the fruit of the <hi>Vine new</hi>; or renewed. 3. Others ſay, This will be after the Reſurrection in the <hi>New Earth.</hi> 4. But the uſual and

ſafeſt Expoſition is, that the Metaphor ſignifieth onely mutual Joy in Heaven.</p>
               <p n="30">30. And when they had ſung an hymn they went out into the mount of Olives.</p>

               <p n="31">31. Then ſaith Jeſus to them, All ye ſhall be offended becauſe of me this night: For it is written, I will ſmite the ſhepheard, and the ſheep of the flock ſhall be ſcattered abroad.</p>

It was the Malignant Policie of that Arch-prieſt, to make Chriſt his own Accuſer, and Witneſs when they could get no other: For they knew that he that bound his Diſciples to confeſs him, would not refuſe to confeſs himſelf, when adjured by God: though he was ſilent as to his Defence againſt Perſonal Accuſations. And ſo it is with Chriſts Enemies to this day, who put Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, that dare neither lie, nor conceale neceſſary truth upon ſelf-Accuſation. As they could find nothing againſt <hi>Daniel,</hi> except about the Law of his God, which he durſt not break to ſave his Life; ſo do the Devils Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers take advantage of good Mens Conſciences, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy them.</p>

                  <hi>Note,</hi> 1. How fooliſh a thing is it to think, that any Law, or any mans Innocency, or Goodneſs, will preſerve Juſtice, or Piety, while bad men are Judges. Can any Law be better than Gods? Or any Perſon better than Chriſt? The Devils Judges poſſeſſing the place that God inſtituted to defend Truth and Equity, will condemn God himſelf manifeſt in Fleſh, by his own Law, and as ſinning againſt himſelf. And they are ſince the ſame.</p>

               <p n="75">75. And Peter remembred the words of Jeſus which ſaid to him, Before the cock crow, thou ſhalt deny me thrice: And he went out, and wept bitterly.</p>

               <p n="7">7. And cried with a loud voice, and ſaid, What have I to do with thee, Jeſus, thou Son of the moſt high God? I adjure thee by God that thou torment me not.</p>
               <p rend="small">7. <hi>N.</hi> It is no wonder if malicious hypocrites abuſe the name of God by Excommunications and reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his trueſt ſervants, when the Devil durſt uſe Gods name to adjure Chriſt himſelf.</p>
               <p n="8">8. For he ſaid to him, Come out of the man thou unclean ſpirit.</p>
               <p rend="small">8. <hi>N.</hi> It appeareth that Devils are not always juſt in the ſame condition, but when they are reſtrained from go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about to do miſchief, it is to them an impriſonment and tornment; as it is to a Wolf to be tyed up from killing ſheep.</p>
               <p n="9">9. And he asked him, What is thy name? and he anſwered him ſaying, My name is Legion, for we are many.</p>
               <p rend="small">9. <hi>N.</hi> Spirits loſe not their individuation by falling into one common ſoul. 2. Seeing the greateſt multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity is among the leaſt of beings (there are more Boughs and Sprigs than Trunks of Trees, more Flyes than men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) It ſeems that the very nature of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils is debaſed with their quality, and they are not now of ſo light a ſpiritual nature as they were before their fall; if there were ſo great a number to afflict one man.</p>
               <p n="10">10. And he beſought him much, that he would not ſend them away out of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. 11. Now there were nigh to the mountains a great herd of ſwine feeding. 12. And all the devils beſought him, ſaying, Send us into the ſwine, that we may enter into them. 13. And forthwith Jeſus gave them leave. And the unclean ſpirits went out and entred into the ſwine, and the herd ran violently down a ſteep place into the ſea, (they were about two thouſand) and they were choaked in the ſea.</p>
               <p rend="small">10, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Let us play a ſmall game rather than none: It will ſomewhat abate our pain, to do ſome miſchief tho a leſs, and not to be impriſoned in the deep. <hi>N.</hi> The reaſon why Devils hurt us no more, is becauſe God will not give them leave.</p>
               <p n="14">14. And they that fed the ſwine fled, and told it in the city and in the countrey. And they went out to ſee what it was that was done. 15. And they come to Jeſus, and ſee him that was poſſeſſed with the devil, and had the Legion, ſitting and cloathed, and in

               <p rend="small">14. <hi>&amp;c. N.</hi> When they were healed by Chriſt, they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him. But when they loſt their Swine by him, they would be rid of him.</p>

               <p n="19">19. Howbeit, Jeſus ſuffered him not, but ſaith to him, Go home to thy friends, and tell them, how great things the Lord hath done for thee, and hath had compaſſion on thee. 20. And he departed, and began to publiſh in Decapolis, how great things Jeſus had done for him: and all men did mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel.</p>
               <p rend="small">18. <hi>&amp;c. N.</hi> All muſt honour God in their places; but not all in one place and ſtation.</p>
               <p n="21">21. And when Jeſus was paſſed over again by ſhip unto the other ſide, much people gathered unto him, and he was nigh unto the ſea. 22. And behold, there cometh one of the rulers of the ſynagogue Jairus by name, and when he ſaw him, he fell at his ſee. 23. And beſought him greatly, ſaying, My little daughter lyeth at the point of death, I pray thee come and lay thy hands on her that ſhe may be healed, and ſhe ſhall live. 24.

When ſhe had heard of Jeſus, came in the preſs behind, and touched his garment: 28. For ſhe ſaid, If I may but touch <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="30">30. And Jeſus immediately knowing in himſelf, that vertue was gone out of him, turned him about in the preſs, and ſaid, Who touched my cloathes? 31. And his diſciples ſaid to him, Thou ſeeſt the multitude throng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thee, and ſayeſt thou, Who touched me? 32. And he looked round about to ſee her that had done this thing. 33. But the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man fearing and trembling, knowing what was done in her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth. 34. And he ſaid to her, Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole, go in peace, and be whole of thy plague.</p>
               <p rend="small">31. <hi>&amp;c. N.</hi> Many touched his cloathes that were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the better; ſo many uſe his name, when they that uſe it in Faith are healed. 2. She feared Chriſt was angry with her, when he healed her.</p>
               <p n="35">35. While he yet ſpake, there came from the ruler of the ſynagogues houſe, certain which ſaid, Thy daughter is dead; why troubleſt thou the maſter any further. 36. As ſoon as Jeſus heard the word that was ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, he ſaith to the ruler of the Synagogue, Be not afraid, onely believe.</p>

               <p n="37">37. And he ſuffered no man to follow him, ſave Peter, and James, and John the brother of James. 38. And he cometh to the houſe of the ruler of the ſynagogue, and ſeeth the tumult, and them that wept and wailed great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. 39. And when he was come in, he ſaith unto them, Why make ye this ado, and weep? the damſel is not dead, but ſleepeth. 40. And they laughed him to ſcorn: but when he had put them all out, he taketh the father and the mother of the damſel, and them that were with him, and entreth in where the damſel was lying. 41. And he took the damſel by the hand, and ſaid to her <hi>Talitha Cumi,</hi> which is, being interpreted, Damſel (I ſay unto thee) ariſe: 42. And ſtraitway the damſel aroſe, and walked, for ſhe was of the age of twelve years: and they were aſtoniſhed with a great aſtoniſhment. 43.

And when the ſabbath-day was come, he began to teach in the ſynagogue; and many hearing him were aſtoniſhed, ſaying, From whence hath this man theſe things? and what wiſdom is this which is given unto him, that even ſuch mighty works are wrought by his hands.</p>

               <p n="4">4. And Jeſus ſaid to them, A prophet is not without honour but in his own country, and among his own kindred, and in his own houſe.</p>
               <p rend="small">4. It is uſual for Prophets to be leaſt ſet by at home, where men that ſee their Natural Original, yet ſee not the Spirit of God in them, nor know his operations,</p>
               <p n="5">5. And he could there do no mighty work, ſave that he laid his hands upon a few ſick folk and healed them. 6. And he marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led becauſe of their unbelief, And he went round about the villages, teaching.</p>
               <p rend="small">5. It was not for want of Power in Chriſt; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were uncapable receivers. Thus Sin goes on from bad to worſe: Unbelief deprived them of the Miracles that ſhould have cured it.</p>
               <p n="7">7. And he called to him the twelve, and began to ſend them forth by two and two, and gave them power over unclean ſpirits.</p>

But be ſhod with ſandals: and not put on two coats. 10. And he ſaid to them, In what place ſoever ye enter into an houſe, there abide till ye depart from that place.</p>

               <p rend="small">
                  <pb facs="tcp:66325:51"/>24. So bad is the heart of man, that it is exceeding hard to have riches and not to place mens truſt in them, and ſuch as do ſo cannot be true Chriſtians and be ſaved.</p>

               <p n="2">2. For there is nothing covered, that ſhall not be revealed, neither hid, that ſhall not be known. 3. Therefore whatſoever ye have ſpoken in darkneſs, ſhall be heard in the light: and that which ye have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the ear in cloſets, ſhall be proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the houſe tops.</p>
               <p rend="small">2.3. Truſt not to Secreſie and Deceit; for all ſecret ſins ſhall be opened at the laſt.</p>
               <p rend="small">
                  <hi>Note</hi>; O how many will that day ſhame! It is our wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, by due confeſſion, to take ſhame ſooner to our ſelves.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And I ſay unto you, my friends, Be not afraid of them that kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do. 5. But I will forewarn you whom you ſhall fear: Fear him which, after he hath killed, hath power to caſt into hell, yea, I ſay unto you, Fear him.</p>
               <p rend="small">4, 5. I give it you as the moſt friendly counſel, Take heed of too much fear of man, leſt it cauſe you to betray your Souls: They can but kill the Body: The Soul over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liveth it; and man's welfare or miſery is after death: Perſecutors or Tyrants cannot reach or hurt you after death. But, as you love your ſelves, fear God, whoſe Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice will be executed on the ungodly after death, and when he hath taken away their Souls, will caſt them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Hell: Again, I ſay, be ſure to fear him.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Are not five ſparrows ſold for two farthings, and not one of them is forgotten before God? 7. But even the very hairs of your head are all numbred: fear not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ye are of more value then many ſparrows.</p>
               <p rend="small">6, 7. God's Providence extendeth to a Sparrow, and to the ſmalleſt creatures; (for he is omnipotent, and all-ſufficient, and maintaineth all;) and much more to you: There is not an hair of your heads not-cauſed, not known, and not regarded by him: And doth he diſregard your lives or welfare, whom he hath raiſed above the rank of Brutes?</p>
               <p rend="small">
                  <hi>Note</hi>; God is as ſufficient for every creature and event, as if he had but that one to mind.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Alſo I ſay unto you, Whoſoever ſhall confeſs me before men, him ſhall the Son of man alſo confeſs before the angels of God.</p>
               <p rend="small">8. Own me ſincerely in the time of Tryal, and I will own you before Angels, where are your greateſt concerns.</p>

               <p n="10">10. And whoſoever ſhall ſpeak a word againſt the Son of man, it ſhall be forgiven him: but unto him that blaſphemeth againſt the holy Ghoſt, it ſhall not be forgiven.</p>
               <p rend="small">10. To ſpeak againſt me, as a man, is pardonable: But when I ſhall ſend the Spirit of Miracles and Holineſs to be my Witneſs in the World, they that will not be convinced by this Spirit, but blaſphemouſly ſay, It is the power and work of the Devils, do ſin againſt the laſt and great means of Conviction, and being uncured, are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardoned.</p>
               <p n="11">11. And when they bring you unto the ſynagogues, and unto magiſtrates and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, take ye no thought how, or what thing ye ſhall anſwer, or what ye ſhall ſay: 12. For the holy Ghoſt ſhall teach you in the ſame hour, what ye ought to ſay.</p>
               <p rend="small">11, 12. Let not the fear of your unready ſpeech diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage you, but truſt the Spirit of God to help you.</p>
               <p n="13">13. And one of the company ſaid unto him, Maſter, ſpeak to my brother, that he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the inheritance with me. 14. And he ſaid unto him, Man, who made me a judge, or a divider over you?</p>
               <p rend="small">13, 14. <hi>N.</hi> Whether the man would have had Chriſt taken on him an Authoritative Deciſion, or only a free Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration, is uncertain; which ever it was, Chriſt refuſeth it: A work of worldly Rule he diſclaimed: And he would not be ſo imprudent as to offend men by an Arbitration without need.</p>
               <p n="15">15. And he ſaid unto them, Take heed, and beware of covetouſneſs: for a mans life conſiſteth not in the abundance of the things which he poſſeſſeth.</p>
               <p rend="small">15. Take heed of being too deſirous of wealth or plenty: For neither life, nor the comfort of life, depends on plenty, but on the holy and obedient uſe of what you have, and on the bleſſing and love of God.</p>
               <p n="16">16. And he ſpake a parable unto them, ſaying, The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully. 17. And he thought within himſelf, ſaying, What ſhall I do, becauſe I have no room where to beſtow my fruits? 18. And he ſaid, This will I do, I will pull down my barns and build greater, and there will I beſtow all my fruits, and my goods. 19. And I will ſay to my ſoul, Soul, thou haſt much goods laid up for many years, take thine eaſe, eat, drink, and be merry. 20. But God ſaid unto him, Thou fool, this night thy ſoul ſhall
<pb facs="tcp:66325:72"/>
be required of thee: then whoſe ſhall thoſe things be which thou haſt provided?</p>
               <p rend="small">16, 17, 18, 19, 20. <hi>Note</hi>; The damning folly of wicked men, is 1. In over-loving the pleaſure of the fleſh, to eat, and drink, and be merry, and live at eaſe. 2. To over-love Riches and Plenty, as proviſion for this fleſhly pleaſure. 3. To flatter themſelves with the conceit of long life, and to forget the ſhortneſs of time, and their latter end. 4. To neglect a due dependence on God for all things. 5. To neglect the due care of the Soul, and preparation for another World, and to ſet leſs by Heaven than Earth; ſuch are the moſt miſerable fools.</p>
               <p n="21">21. So is he that layeth up treaſure for himſelf, and is not rich toward God.</p>
               <p rend="small">21. Such is every one, whoſe chief care and labour is, to have plenteous proviſion for his own Body, and is not rich in Grace, nor uſeth his riches to pleaſe God in good works.</p>
               <p n="22">22. And he ſaid unto his diſciples, There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſay unto you, Take no thought for your life what ye ſhall eat, neither for the body what ye ſhall put on. 23. The life is more then meat, and the body is more then rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

If ye then be not able to do that thing which is leaſt, why take ye thought for the reſt? 27. Conſider the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies how they grow, they toil not, they ſpin not: and yet I ſay unto you, that Solomon in all his glory, was not arayed like one of theſe. 28. If then God ſo cloth the graſs, which is to day in the field, and to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row is caſt into the oven: how much more <hi>will he cloth</hi> you, O ye of little faith?</p>

And how little ſhould we know whether one from the Dead were a Devil, or a credible Meſſenger? and whether he ſaid true or falſe? Should he dwell with us as long as Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters do, men would again deſpiſe and perſecute him: Should he come but once, it would not equal the daily ſollicitations of God's Miniſters. Will one from the Dead heal all Diſeaſes with a word, and raiſe the Dead, and ſend down the Holy Ghoſt on all the Faithful, and give ſuch proof of his Truth, as the Prophets, and Chriſt, and the Apoſtles have done? Will his words have more Light and Power than God's Word hath? Or would not your fleſhly Brethren accuſe him of ſcandalizing and ſlandering the Soul of their noble deceaſed Brother, for telling them he is in Hell, and perſecute him, if he were within their power.</p>

And they lifted up their voices, and ſaid, Jeſus, maſter have mercy upon us. 14. And when he ſaw them, he ſaid unto them, Go ſhew your ſelves to the prieſts.

               <p rend="small">20, 21. You know not what the Kingdom of God is: It is not Chriſt's apperance in viſible pomp, as earthly Princes reign: It is a Moral Spiritual Kingdom, oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite (not to Monarchs, but) to the Kingdom of Satan: As Satan reigneth not viſibly by himſelf, but by cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Princes and Teachers, to do his works, and by his inviſible ſuggeſtions and his baits; ſo the Kingdom of God is to deſtroy Satan's Kingdom, and to ſanctifie and ſave men, not by Chriſt's viſible pompous reign, but by holy Rulers and Teachers, and by his Word and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and promiſes and bleſſings to work on Souls.</p>

               <p rend="small">28, 29, 30. Chriſt's coming, (whether to deſtroy his Enemies, or to judge the World,) will be ſudden, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected, and terrible.</p>

Satan hath got leave to try and ſift you all, and thee in ſpecial: But I have by Prayer prevailed, that tho thou ſin in denying me, thou mayeſt not fall from ſincere Faith: And when by Repentance thou art re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered from thy fall, ſtrengthen thy Brethren, who will forſake me alſo.</p>
               <p n="33">33. And he ſaid unto him, Lord, I am ready to go with thee both into priſon, and to death. 34. And he ſaid, I tell thee, Peter, the cock ſhall not crow this day, before that thou ſhalt thrice deny that thou knoweſt me.</p>
               <p rend="small">33. <hi>Note</hi>; Chriſt that knew Satan's Requeſt, and knew the Event, knew <hi>Peter</hi>'s weakneſs better than he himſelf did.</p>
               <p n="35">35. And he ſaid unto them, When I ſent you without purſe, and ſcrip, and ſhoes, lacked ye any thing? And they ſaid, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. 36. Then ſaid he unto them, But now he that hath a purſe, let him take it, and likewiſe his ſcrip; and he that had no ſword, let him ſell his garment, and buy one. 37. For I ſay unto you, That this that is written, muſt yet be accompliſhed in me, And he was reckoned among the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors: for the things concerning me have an end.</p>

               <p n="40">40. And when he was at the place, he ſaid unto them, Pray, that ye enter not into temptation.</p>
               <p rend="small">40. Prayer is the way both to eſcape Temptation, and in it to overcome.</p>
               <p n="41">41. And he was withdrawn from them about a ſtones caſt, and kneeled down, and prayed. 42. Saying; Father, If thou be willing, remove this cup from me: never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, not my will, but thine be done.</p>
               <p rend="small">41, 42. <hi>N.</hi> For Chriſt in the firſt act by a ſimple Nolition to be unwilling to ſuffer, was no ſin, nor reſiſting God, but the property of Humane Nature: But if he had been averſe in the ſecond comparative act, called <hi>Election,</hi> when he knew it was God's Will, this would have been evil.</p>
               <p n="43">43. And there appeared an angel unto him from heaven, ſtrengthening him.</p>
               <p rend="small">43. <hi>N.</hi> Had Chriſt, as Man, need of an Angels ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening? What need then have we in the approach of death and great ſufferings? And may we not alſo expect Angels help?</p>
               <p n="44">44. And being in an agony, he prayed more earneſtly, and his ſweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground.</p>
               <p rend="small">44. <hi>N.</hi> This was not from the fear of death, but the deep ſenſe of God's wrath againſt ſin, which he, as our Sacrifice, was to bear, in greater pain than meer dying, which his Servants oft bear with peace.</p>
               <p n="45">45. And when he roſe up from prayer, and was come to his diſciples, he found them ſleeping for ſorrow, 46. And ſaid unto them, Why ſleep ye? Riſe and pray, leſt ye enter into temptation.</p>
               <p rend="small">45, 46. <hi>N.</hi> We are apt to ſleep when we have moſt need to watch and pray, and have need to be awakened.</p>
               <p n="47">47. And while he yet ſpake, behold, a mulitude, and he that was called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them, and drew near unto Jeſus, to kiſs him. 48. But Jeſus ſaid unto him, Judas, betrayeſt thou the Son of man with a kiſs?</p>
               <p rend="small">47, 48. <hi>N</hi> God permitted one ſo near Chriſt to betray him, to warn us how far to expect evil from our profeſſed friends.</p>
               <p n="49">49. When they which were about him, ſaw what would follow, they ſaid unto him, Lord, ſhall we ſmite with the ſword? 50. And one of them ſmote the ſervant of the high prieſt, and cut off his right ear.</p>
               <p rend="small">49, 50. Self-defence is natural, but God's Law muſt rule it: They were the more put to fly, becauſe they had reſiſted.</p>
               <p n="51">51. And Jeſus anſwered and ſaid, Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer

               <p rend="small">51. <hi>N.</hi> This Miracle, wrought for one that came to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy him, neither melted nor convinced hardened ſinners.</p>
               <p n="52">52. Then Jeſus ſaid unto the chief prieſts &amp; captains of the temple, and the elders which were come to him, Be ye come out, as againſt a thief, with ſwords and ſtaves? 53. When I was daily with you in the temple, ye ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed forth no hands againſt me: But this is your hour, and the power of darkneſs.</p>
               <p rend="small">52, 53. This is the time which God hath granted Satan to make uſe of you his Inſtruments againſt me, and the Prince of darkneſs will ſeem to conquer.</p>
               <p n="54">54. Then took they him, and led him, and brought him into the high prieſts houſe. And Peter followed afar off. 55. And when they had kindled a fire in the midſt of the hall, and were ſet down together, Peter ſat down a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them. 56. But a certain maid beheld him as he ſat by the fire, &amp; earneſtly looked upon him, and ſaid, This man was alſo with him.</p>
               <p rend="small">54, 55, 56. <hi>N.</hi> When Tryal muſt come, Inſtruments will not be wanting.</p>
               <p n="57">57. And he denied him, ſaying, Woman, I know him not.</p>
               <p rend="small">57. <hi>N.</hi> Had he not been conſcious of ſmiting with the Sword, he had not been in ſo much danger of fear.</p>
               <p n="58">58. And after a little while another ſaw him, and ſaid, Thou art alſo of them. And Peter ſaid, Man, I am not.</p>
               <p rend="small">58. <hi>N.</hi> It was a Woman, here called <hi>Man</hi> only as one of Mankind, not to diſtinguiſh the Sex.</p>
               <p n="59">59. And about the ſpace of one hour after, another confidently affirmed, ſaying, Of a truth this fellow alſo was with him; for he is a Galilean.</p>
               <p rend="small">59. <hi>N.</hi> To belong to Chriſt, and follow him, is crime enough, when Enemies are Judges.</p>
               <p n="60">60. And Peter ſaid, Man, I know not what thou ſayeſt. And immediately while he yet ſpake, the cock crew. 61. And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter; and Peter remembred the word of the Lord, how he had ſaid unto him, Before the cock crow, thou ſhalt deny me thrice. 62. And Peter went out, and wept bitterly.</p>
               <p rend="small">60, 61, 62. <hi>N.</hi> Chriſt's own danger did not make him forget a ſinning Diſciple.</p>
               <p n="63">63. And the men that held Jeſus, mocked him, and ſmote him. 64. And when they had blindfolded him, they ſtroke him on the face, and asked him, ſaying, Propheſie, who is it that ſmote thee? 65. And many other things blaſphemouſly ſpake they againſt him.</p>
               <p rend="small">63, 64, 65. <hi>N.</hi> What is it that the ignorant Rabble will not ſay and do againſt the beſt of men, when men called <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred</hi> and <hi>Great</hi> encourage them?</p>
               <p n="66">66. And aſſoon as it was day, the elders of the people, and the chief prieſts and the Scribes came together, and led them into their council, ſaying, 67. Art thou the Chriſt? tell us. And he ſaid unto them, If I tell you, you will not believe. 68. And if I alſo ask you, you will not anſwer me, nor let me go.</p>
               <p rend="small">66, 67, 68. It's in vain to diſcourſe with you; for you are reſolved what to do with me, and truſt to force, and not to Truth.</p>
               <p n="69">69. Hereafter ſhall the Son of man ſit on the right hand of the power of God.</p>
               <p rend="small">69. I ſhall ſhortly be advanced in Heaven as Man, to be Lord of all.</p>
               <p n="70">70. Then ſaid they all, Art thou then the Son of God? and he ſaid unto them, Ye ſay that I am. 71. And they ſaid, What need we any further witneſs? for we our ſelves have heard of his own mouth.</p>
               <p rend="small">70, 71. <hi>N.</hi> Though Chriſt anſwered not their other Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations, he would not, to ſave his life, by ſilence ſeem to fear to own his Nature, Dignity and Office; elſe he that laid our Salvation upon our open confeſſing him in the face of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt danger, ſhould have required more of us, than he would do himſelf. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>With the mouth confeſſion is made to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi>; and giveth <hi>Timothy</hi> Chriſt's Example, who <hi>before</hi> Pontius Pilate <hi>witneſſed a good confeſſion, Rom.</hi> 10, 9, 10. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.13.</p>

               <p n="27">27. And upon this came his Diſciples and marvelled that he talked with the Woman: yet no man ſaid, what ſeekeſt thou? or why talkeſt thou with her?</p>

He that loveth God and Chriſt, and the Holy Ghoſt and the Church; muſt rejoyce when there is one more converted, to pleaſe and worſhip God, to honour Chriſt and his Spirit, to encreaſe the Church: He that loveth his Country, muſt rejoyce that one more is made a bleſſing to it, when the wicked are it's enemies: He that loveth Souls will rejoyce in that Grace which is better to them than all riches: He that loveth Gods Word will rejoyce in it's ſucceſs: He that loveth Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven will be glad that there is one more to poſſeſs it: He that loveth himſelf aright, will be glad that there is one more made like him, to love him, and pray for him.

               <p n="39">39. And many of the Samaritans of that City believed on him, for the ſaying of the woman which teſtifyed, He told me all that ever I did.</p>
               <p rend="small">39. N. That to believe in Chriſt by the means of mens credible teſtimony of his Words and Miracles, is not (as many falſly ſay) to reſolve our faith into the credit of man and to make it a meer humane Faith. They that believe Apoſtles who ſaid they ſaw Chriſts Miracles, Reſurrection and Aſcention, believe by a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Faith, on the ſame evidence that the Apoſtles were convinced by, but not conveyed by the ſame means: what they received by their eyes and ears im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, we receive mediately by their report, liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at a diſtance: So that their teſtimony is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved inſtead of Chriſts, nor inſtead of evidence of his truth, but as the conveyance of this evidence inſtead of our mediate ſight and hearing: ſo is it as to the Tradition of the Bible, Baptiſm, Creed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition doth but deliver to us the ſame word mediately which the firſt Churches received immediately from the Apoſtles. He that cannot read may be ſaved by believing the Goſpel tranſlated and read, or reported by the Preachers.</p>
               <p n="40">40. So when the Samaritans were come to him, they beſought him that he would tarry with them, and he abode there two days. 41. And many more believed, becauſe of his own words, 42. And ſaid to the woman, now we believe, not becauſe of thy ſaying, for we have heard him our ſelves, and know that this is indeed the Chriſt, the Saviour of the World.</p>
               <p rend="small">
                  <pb facs="tcp:66325:91"/>42. Not ſo much becauſe of thy ſaying. N. Yet this was the ſame ſort of Faith, though by the evidence divers ways conveyed.</p>
               <p n="43">43. Now after two days he departed thence and went into Galilee. 44. For Jeſus himſelf teſtifyed, that a Prophet hath no honour in his own Country.</p>
               <p rend="small">43. He went into <hi>Galilee,</hi> not to <hi>Nazareth</hi> where he had lived, but to <hi>Cana</hi>: For he had teſtified that a Prophet is deſpiſed in his own Country; where they have ſeen his common Parentage and Education, but ſee not Gods Spirit in him: and familiarity breeds con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.</p>
               <p n="45">45. Then when he was come into Galilee the Galileans received him, having ſeen all the things that he did at Jeruſalem at the feaſt; for they alſo went unto the feaſt.</p>
               <p rend="small">45. His former and later Miracles cauſed theſe <hi>Gali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans</hi> to receive him.</p>
               <p n="46">46. So Jeſus came again into Cana of Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilee, where he made the water wine, and there was a certain Nobleman whoſe Son was ſick at Capernaum. 47. When he heard, That Jeſus was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he went unto him, and beſought him that he would come down and heal his Son; for he was at the point of Death. 48. Then ſaid Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus to him, except ye ſee ſigns and wonders, ye will not believe. 49. The Nobleman ſaith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die. 50. Jeſus ſaith to him, Go thy way, thy Son liveth. And the man believed the word that Jeſus had ſpoken to him, and went his way. 51. And as he was now going down, his Servants met him, and told him, ſaying, Thy Son li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth. 52. Then enquired he of them, the hour, when he began to amend; and they ſaid unto him, Yeſterday at the ſeventh hour the fever left him. 53. So the Father knew, that it was at the ſame hour, in which Jeſus ſaid to him, Thy Son liveth: And himſelf believed, and his whole houſe. 54. This is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain the ſecond Miracle that Jeſus did, when he was come out of Judea into Galilee.</p>
               <p rend="small">46. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> N. 1. Outward neceſſities which nature is ſenſible of, drived many to ſeek to Chriſt. 2. Children ſpeed the better for their Parents Faith: And if in the Poly, why not in the Soul. 3. When the Rulers of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies believe, they muſt endeavour the converſion of their whole Families. And God oft bleſſeth ſuch en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours. 4.

In theſe lay a great number of impotent folks, blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water. 4. For an Angel went down in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Pool, at a certain ſeaſon, and troubled the water; whoſoever then firſt after the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling of the water ſtepped in, was made whole of whatſoever diſeaſe he had.</p>

How unexcuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble was this man if he had been proud, or worldly, or careleſs of his everlaſting State? O my God I thank thee for the like diſcipline of eight and fifty years, how ſafe a life is this in Compariſon of full proſperity and pleaſure.</p>
               <p n="6">6. When Jeſus ſaw him lye, and knew that he had been now a long time in that caſe, he ſaith to him, wilt thou be made whole. 7. The impotent man anſwered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled to put me into the Pool, but while I am coming, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother ſteppeth down before me. 8. Jeſus ſaith unto him, Riſe, take up thy Bed, and walk.</p>

When Jeſus then lift up his eyes and ſaw a great company come unto him, he ſaith to Philip, whence ſhall we buy bread that theſe may eat. 6. And this he ſaid to prove him, for he himſelf knew what he would do.</p>

               <p rend="small">7. N. <hi>Philips</hi> ſenſe of the difficulty was a preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the value of the Miracle.</p>
               <p n="8">8. One of the Diſciples, Andrew, Simon Peters Brother, ſaith to him. 9. There is a Lad here which hath five Barley Loaves and two ſmall Fiſhes: but what are they among ſo many?</p>

Therefore they ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered them together, and filled twelve Baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets with the fragments of the five barly loaves, which remained over and above to them that had eaten.</p>

come to me, and him that cometh to me I will in no wiſe caſt out.</p>
               <p rend="small">37. All that the Father hath given to me as fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to ſave them ſhall believe and take me for their Saviour: I come not into the World upon an uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of ſucceſs: I have undertaken the effectual ſaving of thoſe that are given me by the Father to be certainly ſaved: All thoſe will come to me, and I will refuſe none that by obedient truſt doth come to me.</p>
               <p n="38">38. For I come down from heaven, not to do my own Will, but the Will of him that ſent me.</p>
               <p rend="small">38. For I come not at random, or on any ſelfiſh tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral deſign, but to fulfill my Fathers will, who will give the Kingdom to his ſelected Flocks</p>
               <p rend="small">N. It is a troubling controverſie, how Chriſt is ſaid to come down from Heaven: His humane Nature was never there, and his Divine, removeth not thence, and is every where. To paſs by their opinion, who ſay it is a middle ſuper-angelical firſt created Nature, between the Divine and Humane that came down: I anſwer, that the Divine is ſaid to come down, not by a ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial removal or change of place, but by a tranſcendent influx and operation, on the Humane Nature of Chriſt: Men may talk in the dark how they pleaſe, but it's cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that that Divine Eſſence is every where, without inequality or exiſtence: and is no more in Chriſts Humane Nature as to eſſential preſence than he is eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where: But as he is ſaid to <hi>be in Heaven,</hi> becauſe there he operateth by glorious refulgency and love to the glorified, ſo he is more eminently and peculiarly united to the Manhood of Chriſt, for and by a more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent and peculiar operation on the Humane Nature: As the Sun is more in the Eye than in the Hand or Foot, more in the Plants that it quickneth than in the Stones, ſo is the Godhead in the Humane Nature of Chriſt. And ſo the Godhead came down from Heaven, as the Sun doth when it ſhineth in at our Windows, or on a burning glaſs, or rather as it animateth Plants.</p>
               <p n="39">39. And this is the Fathers will, who hath ſent me, that of all which he hath given me, I ſhould loſe nothing, but ſhould raiſe it up again at the laſt day.</p>
               <p rend="small">39. And it is the ſpecial Commiſſion which I have from my Father, that I ſhould effectually ſave all theſe his choſen, and raiſe them up to life everlaſting.</p>
               <p n="40">40. And this is the will of him that ſent me, that every one who ſeeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlaſting life, and I will raiſe him up at the laſt day.</p>
               <p rend="small">40. And it is my Fathers will, that every one by notice of the evidence of my truth, truly believeth on me, ſhall have everlaſting Life, to which (firſt here be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gun) I will raiſe him at the laſt.</p>
               <p n="41">41. The Jews then murmured at him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſaid, I am the bread which came down from heaven, 42. And they ſaid, Is not this Jeſus, the Son of Joſeph, whoſe Father and Mother we know? How is it then that he ſaith, I come down from heaven.</p>
               <p rend="small">41. N. This difficulty ſtalled their Faith, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the myſtery of Chriſts Perſon and Incarnation.</p>
               <p n="43">43. Jeſus therefore anſwered and ſaid to them, murmur not among your ſelves, 44. No man can come to me, except the Father which hath ſent me draw him, and I will raiſe him up at the laſt day.</p>
               <p rend="small">43. The objections which you murmur on, do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed require Divine Grace to overcome them; and therefore none can ſincerely believe and come to me as a Chriſtian, except the Father who ſent me to ſave men, convince and draw them to me to be ſaved, and all thoſe I will raiſe to life everlaſting.</p>
               <p n="45">45. It is written in the Prophets: and they ſhall be all taught of God. Every man there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that hath heard and learned of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cometh unto me.</p>
               <p rend="small">45. As the Prophets ſpeak of a Divine teaching, ſo it is thoſe that are thus taught of God that come to me.</p>
               <p n="46">46. Not that any Man hath ſeen the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſave he which is of God: he hath ſeen the Father.</p>
               <p rend="small">46. Not by a Teaching by ſeeing him: For it is I only that come from him that have ſeen him.</p>
               <p n="47">47. Verily, verily, I ſay to you, he that believeth in me hath everlaſting life. 48. I am the bread of life. 49. Your Fathers did eat Manna in the Wilderneſs and are dead: 50. This is the bread that came down from Heaven, that a man may eat thereof and not die. 51. I am the living bread which cometh down from Heaven: If any man eat of this bread he ſhall live for ever, and the bread that I ſhall give him is my fleſh, which I will give for the life of the World.</p>
               <p rend="small">47. I tell you, he that believeth on me hath that everlaſting Life, which Manna gave not, for they are dead that did eat it: I am the Bread that come indeed from Heaven and give Life, not temporary but ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting, not to a few, but to the World, or univerſal Church: My ſacrificed fleſh ſhall purchaſe this.</p>
               <p n="52">52. The Jews therefore drove among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſaying, how can this man give us his fleſh to eat. 53. Then Jeſus ſaid to them, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, verily, I ſay to you, except ye eat the fleſh of the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

my fleſh and drinketh my blood hath eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life, and I will raiſe him up at the laſt day. 55. For my fleſh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.</p>
               <p rend="small">52. This ſeemed to them a ſaying not to be digeſted, and Chriſt at that time would no further explain it to them, than by ſaying, I tell you unleſs that you live by virtue of my Fleſh and Blood received by Faith as food is by your mouth, ye have no ſpiritual ſaving life: It is all they that thus by Faith partake of my Sacrific<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Fleſh and Blood that have the Title and beginning of Eternal Life, and I will at laſt raiſe them up to the full fruition of it: For my ſacrificed Fleſh and Blood are truly enlivening and ſaving.</p>
               <p n="56">56. He that eateth my fleſh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me, and I in him.</p>
               <p rend="small">56. He that by true Faith truſteth in my ſacrificed Fleſh and Blood, profeſſeth thereby to be united to me as digeſted food is to the body whereby I alſo dwell in him, and I will give him the Spirit of Life, and he ſhall live by influence from me.</p>
               <p n="57">57. As the living Father hath ſent me, and I live by the Father, ſo he that eateth me, he ſhall live by me.</p>
               <p rend="small">57. As the Father is Eſſential <hi>Self-life,</hi> and I live by Communication from him; ſo he that is intimately united to me, and I to him as food is to the body by digeſtion, by a covenanting lively Faith, ſhall live by me a life of Grace and Glory.</p>
               <p n="58">58. This is the bread which came down from Heaven: Not as your Fathers did eat Manna and are dead; He that eateth of this bread ſhall live for ever.</p>
               <p rend="small">58. I am the true Bread from Heaven, who give e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting Life, when your Fathers who did eat Manna died, and were not by that made immortal.</p>
               <p n="59">59. Theſe things ſaid he in the Synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum.</p>
               <p rend="small">59. N. Remember it was not thoſe only that had followed him that he ſpake this to, and the following ſharp paſſages; but to his auditors at <hi>Capernaum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="60">60. Many therefore of his Diſciples, when they had heard this, ſaid, this is an hard ſaying, who can hear it.</p>
               <p rend="small">60. N. Chriſt would not forbear this myſterious doctrine, though the hearers could not digeſt it, but would make an ill uſe of it, to depart from him.</p>
               <p n="61">61. When Jeſus knew in himſelf that his Diſciples murmured at it, he ſaith to them, doth this offend you: 62. What if ye ſhall ſee the Son of Man aſcend up where he was before.</p>
               <p rend="small">61. I will e're long aſcend up viſibly to Heaven: And will not that prove that I came from Heaven?</p>
               <p n="63">63. It is the Spirit that quickneth: The Fleſh profiteth nothing: The words that I ſpeak to you, they are Spirit and they are Life.</p>
               <p rend="small">63. And as to your offence at my words of the <hi>eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of my Fleſh,</hi> you know that Fleſh of it ſelf would be a dead and ſenſleſs thing, were it not for the Soul that is it's life: And ſo it is not my meer dead fleſh that I ſay ſhall give you life; but my Fleſh as it is in dignity the Body of the Son of God, purchaſing life for the World, and as it is accompanied with the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Holy Ghoſt, which animaterh them ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually who by Faith are united to me: And thus not only my fleſh, but the words that I ſpeak to you, are by my Spirit made the means of communicating to you Spirit and Life.</p>
               <p n="64">64. But there are ſome of you that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not: For Jeſus knew from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, who they were that believed not, and who ſhould betray him.</p>
               <p rend="small">64. But there are ſome of you that follow me, that are not true believers, and therefore have not this quickening Spirit. For he knew their hearts, and knew who would after betray him.</p>
               <p rend="small">N. Though Chriſt knew <hi>Judas</hi> and other Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, he did not expel them, but ſent out <hi>Judas</hi> to Preach with the reſt, to tell us how the viſible Church will be conſtituted and muſt be ordered.</p>
               <p n="65">65. And he ſaid, therefore I ſay to you, that no man can come to me, except it were given to him of my Father.</p>
               <p rend="small">65. N. That the word [<hi>Can</hi>] ſpeaketh not of Phyſical power, but partly moral indiſpoſition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and partly an hypothetical impoſſibility of event. 2. That though Gods grace be the cauſe of faith, no man is deprived of that Grace but by his own wilful ſin, which maketh him unexcuſable.</p>
               <p n="66">66. From that time many of his Diſciples went back and walked no more with him.</p>
               <p rend="small">66. By forſaking him they ſhewed that they were never ſound believers.</p>
               <p n="67">67. Then ſaid Jeſus to the twelve, will ye alſo go away? 68. Then Simon Peter an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered him, Lord to whom ſhall we go? Thou haſt the words of eternal life. 69. And we believe and are ſure that thou art the Chriſt the Son of the living God.</p>
               <p rend="small">67. N. 1. Chriſt puts none away, till they put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way themſelves. 2. He forceth none to ſtay. 3. It greatly fixeth a Chriſtians reſolution to ſtick to Chriſt, to know there is none elſe to go to: As it reſolveth us to look for happineſs to God and Heaven, becauſe we are ſure there is no other. 4. ſound Faith may attain aſſurance that Chriſt is the Son of the living God: It hath alwayes objective certainty, and a prevalent cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, and a prevalent confidence, and may reach to a mental confirmed certainty.</p>

               <p rend="small">4. And as the ſheep uſing to find that their Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd hurteth them not, but feedeth them and bringeth them to paſture, therefore follow him willingly as one that loveth them and is for their good; ſo do Chriſts ſheep believe that he loveth them and is their Saviour, and therefore follow him and know his voice.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And a ſtranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for they know not the voice of ſtrangers.</p>
               <p rend="small">5. And as Sheep (like our Dogs) have no ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in a ſtranger, but fly from him in fear, ſo will true Chriſtians do from falſe Chriſts and from falſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors for their voice is ſtrange to them, and contrary to the new nature that is in them, and to their good.</p>
               <p n="6">6. This parable ſpake Jeſus unto them: but they underſtood not what things they were which he ſpake unto them. 7. Then ſaid Jeſus unto them again, Verily, verily I ſay unto you, I am the door of the ſheep. 8. All that ever came before me, are theives and robbers: but the ſheep did not hear them. 9. I am the door, by me if any man enter in, he ſhall be ſaved, and ſhall go in and out, and find paſture.</p>
               <p rend="small">7. As my Fathers Miſſion and Witneſs is the door by which I enter, ſo I being hereby made the Shepherd of the Flock am the door by which all others, Paſtors and Flocks muſt enter. All that before me pretended to be Chriſts, were but Theives and Robbers, and the choſen flock of God did not believe in them nor follow them. I am the true Chriſt and Head of the Church: They that believe in me and follow me, ſhall as my ſheep be ſafe and plentifully fed.</p>
               <p n="10">10. The thief cometh not, but for to ſteal, and to kill, and to deſtroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.</p>
               <p rend="small">10. Falſe Chriſts and falſe Prophets have but ſought themſelves, and ſeduced the people to deſtruction of Soul and Body: I am come to give men ſpiritual and eternal Life, and to raiſe them higher in Light, Life and Love, than was vouchſafed to the Church before my Incarnation.</p>
               <p n="11">11. I am the good ſhepherd: the good ſhepherd giveth his life for the ſheep.</p>
               <p rend="small">11. As he that keeps the ſheep not as an hireling, but as his own will venture himſelf to defend them from Theives and Wolves; ſo will I lay down my life for my ſheep.</p>
               <p n="12">12. But he that is an hireling, and not the ſhepherd, whoſe own the ſheep are not, ſeeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the ſheep, and fleeth: and the wolf catcheth them, and ſcattereth the ſheep. 13. The hireling fleeth, becauſe he is an hireling, and careth not for the ſheep.</p>
               <p rend="small">12, 13. He that ſeeketh his own worldly intereſt by deceit, will ſhift for himſelf, and for that intereſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the people to deſtruction, as not ſeeking their ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation but his vain-glory.</p>
               <p n="14">14. I am the good ſhepherd, and know my ſheep, and am known of mine.</p>
               <p rend="small">14. I known mine own, their perſons, their hearts and all their concerns; with the love and care of a good Shepherd: And my grace hath taught them to know me and my Word.</p>
               <p n="15">15. As the Father knoweth me, even ſo know I the Father: and I lay down my life for the ſheep.</p>
               <p rend="small">15. As my Father knoweth me with Love and I know the Father, ſo with a ſpecial Love I lay down my Life for their Redemption and Salvation.</p>
               <p n="16">16. And other ſheep I have, which are not of this fold: them alſo I muſt bring, and they ſhall hear my voice; and there ſhall be one fold, and one ſhepherd.</p>
               <p rend="small">16. And beſides the Jews I have a choſen people a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Gentiles: Them I muſt call and gather to me: and Jews and Gentiles ſhall be one Catholick Church under me their only univerſal Head and Shepherd.</p>
               <p n="17">17. Therefore doth my Father love me, becauſe I lay down my life, that I might take it again.</p>
               <p rend="small">17. N. 1. It is not unfit to aſſign cauſes in man of Gods Love. 2. Yet nothing real in God is cauſed by any Creature. 3. But as Gods Love is taken for it's Effects, our qualifications are a receptive cauſe or diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. 4. And ſo a cauſe extrinſical of the Relative de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination of God himſelf. So Chriſts conſent to do the full work of a Mediator, was the condition of his peculiar reward, which is call'd the Fathers loving him for it.</p>
               <p n="18">18. No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of my ſelf: I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my Father.</p>
               <p rend="small">18. N. 1. Chriſt foreknew his Death and Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: 2. It was the Law of Mediation proper to him, that he ſhould conſent ſo to die, and then Riſe and Reign as his reward.</p>
               <p n="19">19. There was a diviſion therefore again among the Jews for theſe ſayings. 20. And

many of them ſaid, He hath a devil, and is mad, why hear ye him? 21. Others ſaid, Theſe are not the words of him that hath a devil: Can a devil open the eyes of the blind?</p>
               <p rend="small">20. When they underſtood not Chriſt, they ſaid, the man is a diſtracted demoniack: Why ſtand you to hear him: But others were better convinced both by his Words and his Miracles.</p>
               <p n="22">22. And it was at Jeruſalem the feaſt of the dedication, and it was winter.</p>
               <p rend="small">22. N. Chriſt refuſed not to be preſent at this ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Feaſt, though appointed but by <hi>Maccabeus</hi> for a thankful commemoration of the repairing of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
               <p n="23">23. And Jeſus walked in the temple in So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomons porch. 24. Then came the Jews round about him, and ſaid unto him, How long doſt thou make us to doubt? If thou be the Chriſt, tell us plainly.</p>
               <p rend="small">24. Put us out of doubt.</p>
               <p n="25">25. Jeſus anſwered them, I told you, and ye believed not: the works that I do in my Fathers name, they bear witneſs of me.</p>
               <p rend="small">25. Why ask you me to tell you, who believe me not: My Miracles done in the Name and by the Power of God, are a more ſatisfying teſtimony than my words.</p>
               <p n="26">26. But ye believe not, becauſe ye are not of my ſheep, as I ſaid unto you. 27. My ſheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me.</p>
               <p rend="small">26, 27, But no wonder that you believe not me; for you are not my choſen flock, nor qualified to believe: Were you my ſheep you would underſtand, believe, and obey my Word.</p>
               <p n="28">28. And I give unto them eternal life, and they ſhall never periſh, neither ſhall any pluck them out of my hand.</p>
               <p rend="small">28. To my true flock, I will give eternal Life, and they ſhall never be condemned, loſt or forſaken: Nor ſhall any power prevail againſt me who will ſave them.</p>
               <p n="29">29. My Father which gave them me, is greater then all: and none is able to pluck them out of my Fathers hand. 30. I and my Father are one.</p>
               <p rend="small">29, 30. God my Father who gave them me to be ſaved is Almighty, and none can overcome him, and take them from his ſaving love. And He and I being one they are ſafe with me.</p>
               <p n="31">31. Then the Jews took up ſtones again to ſtone him. 32. Jeſus anſwered them, Many good works have I ſhewed you from my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for which of thoſe works do ye ſtone me? 33. The Jews anſwered him, ſaying, For a good work we ſtone thee not, but for blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy, and becauſe that thou, being a man, makeſt thy ſelf God.</p>
               <p rend="small">31. N. No good work could ſecure the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from the rage of ignorant men nor from their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation.</p>
               <p n="34">34. Jeſus anſwered them, Is it not written in your Law, I ſaid, Ye are gods? 35. If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God came, and the Scripture cannot be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. 36. Say ye of him whom the Father hath ſanctified, and ſent into the world, Thou blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemeſt: becauſe I ſaid, I am the Son of God?</p>
               <p rend="small">34, 35, 36. If they may be called Gods that are but Magiſtrates, and men in dignity and power, how can you ſay, It is blaſphemy for me to ſay, I am the Son of God, who am by the Father ſanctified to the office of Mediator and ſent into the World thereunto.</p>
               <p rend="small">N. That Chriſt here by his pleading for his right to his Title only from his office, doth not deny his Title as from eternal generation, but only tell them what they were then fit to hear.</p>
               <p n="37">37. If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not. 38. But if I do, though ye believe not me, believe the works: that ye may know and believe that the Father is in me, and I in him.</p>
               <p rend="small">37. If I do not ſuch works as certainly ſignifie Gods atteſtation, believe me not: But if I do, believe what thoſe works do ſurely evidence, and then you will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that God is in me and worketh them by me, and that I am in him and approved and acted by him.</p>
               <p n="39">39. Therefore they ſought again to take him: but he eſcaped out of their hands. 40. And went away again beyond Jordan, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the place where John at firſt baptized: and there he abode. 41. And many reſorted unto him, and ſaid, John did no miracle: but all things that John ſpake of this man, were true. 42. And many believed on him there.</p>
               <p rend="small">39. He avoided their perſecution by flight: And in the Wilderneſs where <hi>John</hi> firſt baptized many believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on him, ſeeing all fulfilled by him, which <hi>John</hi> had foretold of him.</p>

(It was that Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair, whoſe brother Lazarus was ſick). 3. Therefore his ſiſters ſent unto him, ſaying, Lord, behold, he whom thou loveſt is ſick.</p>
               <p rend="small">N. 1. It's a doubt whether <hi>Bethany</hi> be the name of a Town, or only of a tract of ground where the Town was. 2. It is like that this <hi>Mary</hi> is not the ſame with <hi>Mary Magdalen.</hi> 3. It is a word of comfort in all troubles, if we can ſay, it is on one that Chriſt loveth.</p>
               <p n="4">4. When Jeſus heard that, he ſaid, this ſickneſs is not unto death, but for the glory of God: that the Son of God might be glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thereby.</p>
               <p rend="small">4. Gods end in this ſickneſs of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> is not to remove him by death from this world, but to prepare an advantage for the glorifying of himſelf in me.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Now Jeſus loved Martha, and her ſiſter, and Lazarus. 6. When he had heard there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that he was ſick, he abode two days ſtill in the ſame place where he was. 7. Then af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that ſaith he to his diſciples, Let us go into Judea again.</p>
               <p rend="small">5. His love to them inclined him to help them: yet he moved not that his advantage might be the greater, to ſhew his Love and Power by raiſing the dead (N. We muſt not miſinterpret Gods delays).</p>
               <p n="8">8. His diſciples ſay unto him, Maſter the Jews of late have ſought to ſtone thee, and goeſt thou thither again? 9. Jeſus anſwered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man walk in the day, he ſtumbleth not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſeeth the light of this world. 10. But if a man walk in the night, he ſtumbleth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is no light in him.</p>
               <p rend="small">9. As a man that walketh in the twelve hours of day light is kept from ſtumbling by that light: So while my day of work continueth I am ſafe.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Theſe things ſaid he, and after that he ſaith unto them; Our friend Lazarus ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; but I go that I may awake him out of his ſleep. 12. Then ſaid his diſciples, Lord, if he ſleep, he ſhall do well. 13. Howbeit Jeſus ſpake of his death: but they thought that he had ſpoken of taking of reſt in ſleep. 14. Then ſaid Jeſus unto them plainly, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus is dead. 15. And I am glad for your ſakes, that I was not there (to the intent ye may believe) nevertheleſs, let us go unto him.</p>
               <p rend="small">15. To raiſe him will more convince you, than it would have done, meerly to cure him.</p>
               <p n="16">16. Then ſaid Thomas, which is called Didymus, unto his fellow-diſciples, Let us alſo go, that we may die with him.</p>
               <p rend="small">16. Whether <hi>Thomas</hi> ſpake this in meer paſſion, [Let us die with grief] or as expecting Chriſts death and theirs by the perſecuting Jews, is to us uncertain.</p>
               <p n="17">17. Then when Jeſus came, he found that he had lain in the grave four days alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. 18. (Now Bethany was nigh unto Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, about fifteen furlongs off). 19. And ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Jews came to Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother.</p>
               <p rend="small">18. N. A furlong is ſix hundred foot.</p>
               <p n="20">20. Then Martha, aſſoon as ſhe heard that Jeſus was coming, went and met him: but Mary ſat ſtill in the houſe. 21. Then ſaid Martha unto Jeſus, Lord, if thou hadſt been here, my brother had not died. 22. But I know, that even now whatſoever thou wilt ask of God, God will give it thee.</p>
               <p rend="small">21, 22. N. She believed that Chriſt could have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented his death, and could yet raiſe him. 2. And that it muſt be by prayer to God.</p>
               <p n="23">23. Jeſus ſaith unto her, Thy brother ſhall riſe again. 24. Martha ſaith unto him, I know that he ſhall riſe again in the reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction at the laſt day.</p>
               <p rend="small">23. N. The Reſurrection of the Body was then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved as an undoubted truth.</p>
               <p n="25">25. Jeſus ſaid unto her, I am the reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet ſhall he live: 26. And whoſoever liveth, and believeth in me, ſhall never die. Believeſt thou this?</p>
               <p rend="small">25. I am the principle and cauſe of Life and Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. The dead that believe in me ſhall be raiſed: And the living that believe in me ſhall live for ever, their Souls firſt and their Bodies after raiſed to bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p n="27">27. She ſaith unto him, Yea, Lord: I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that thou art the Chriſt the Son of God which ſhould come into the world.</p>
               <p rend="small">
                  <pb facs="tcp:66325:96"/>27. Yea for I believe that thou art the Chriſt, and herefore haſt power of life and death.</p>
               <p n="28">28. And when ſhe had ſo ſaid, ſhe went her way, and called Mary her ſiſter ſecretly, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, The Maſter is come and calleth for thee. 29. Aſſoon as ſhe heard that, ſhe aroſe quickly, and came unto him. 30. Now Jeſus was not yet come into the town, but was in that place where Martha met him. 31. The Jews then which were with her in the houſe, and comforted her, when they ſaw Mary that ſhe roſe up haſtily, and went out, followed her, ſaying, She goeth unto the grave, to weep there.</p>
               <p rend="small">29. N. Faith, Love, and Neceſſity will make all haſt.</p>
               <p n="32">32. Then when Mary was come where Je<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſus was, and ſaw him, ſhe fell down at his feet, ſaying unto him, Lord, if thou hadſt been here, my brother had not died. 33. When Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus therefore ſaw her weeping, and the Jews alſo weeping which came with her, he groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ſpirit, and was troubled. 34. And ſaid, Where have ye laid him? they ſay unto him, Lord, come and ſee. 35. Jeſus wept.</p>
               <p rend="small">32, 35. N. Chriſt wept in compaſſion with his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants ſorrows: And he loveth us no leſs now, than when he wept with mourners.</p>
               <p n="36">36. Then ſaid the Jews, Behold how he loved him.</p>
               <p rend="small">36. Love can expreſs it ſelf by grief for the hurt of thoſe whom we love.</p>
               <p n="37">37. And ſome of them ſaid, Could not this man which opened the eyes of the blind, have cauſed that even this man ſhould not have died? 38. Jeſus therefore again groaning in himſelf, cometh to the grave. It was a cave, and a ſtone lay upon it. 39. Jeſus ſaid, take away the ſtone. Martha, the ſiſter of him that was dead, ſaith unto him, Lord, by this time he ſtinketh: for he hath been dead four days.</p>
               <p rend="small">39. N. How vile a thing will leſs than four days, ſhew the body of man to be? Is pride and vain pamper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fit for ſuch a body?</p>
               <p n="40">40. Jeſus ſaith unto her, Said I not unto thee, that if thou wouldſt believe thou ſhouldſt ſee the glory of God.</p>
               <p rend="small">40. N. The effect of Gods power is the Glory; and unbelief hinders the effect in us.</p>
               <p n="41">41. Then they took away the ſtone from the place where the dead was laid. And Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus lift up his eyes, and ſaid, Father, I thank thee that thou haſt heard me. 42. And I knew that thou heardſt me always: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the people which ſtand by, I ſaid it, that they may believe that thou haſt ſent me.</p>
               <p rend="small">41, 42. He looked up towards Heaven as the place of Gods glory, the ſpring and end of earthly bleſſings: N. Chriſt knew before that God would do this Miracle by him: but begg'd it by prayer to convince the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers that it was of God. 2. It's our comfort that Chriſts interceſſion is always heard:</p>
               <p n="43">43. And when he thus had ſpoken, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus come forth. 44. And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with grave cloths: and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jeſus ſaith unto them, Looſe him, and let him go.</p>
               <p rend="small">43. N, It was not the lowd voice, but the inviſible power that revived him: yet Chriſt would ſuit his voice thereto. 2. It's vain to ask, how could he go when his feet was bound? As if all ſort of binding diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled from riſing, or Chriſt could not enable him who revived him.</p>
               <p n="45">45. Then many of the Jews which came to Mary, and had ſeen the things which Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus did, believed on him.</p>
               <p rend="small">45. This Miracle convinced many (and it's ſtrange that it convinced not all.)</p>
               <p n="46">46. But ſome of them went their ways to the Phariſees, and told them what things Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus had done.</p>
               <p rend="small">46. Some hardened Spectators turn'd all this but to information againſt him to the Phariſees.</p>
               <p n="47">47. Then gathered the chief Prieſts and the Phariſees a councel and ſaid, what do we? for this man doeth many mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. 48. If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him; and the Romans ſhall come and take away both our Place and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. 49. And one of them named Caiaphas, being the high prieſt that ſame year, ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, Ye know nothing at all, 50. Nor conſider that it is expedient for us, that one man ſhould die for the people, and that the whole nation periſh not.</p>
               <p rend="small">47. N. 1. The greater Chriſts Miracles were the more they thought they ought to deſtroy him, becauſe the people would the more follow him: And ſtill the wiſer and better any Miniſter of Chriſt is the mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> worldly wicked men endeavour to deſtroy them, becauſe the
<pb facs="tcp:66325:96"/>
people follow them. 2. The fear of great Mens power more than Gods cauſeth wicked Polititians to deſtroy the beſt. 3. But thereby they bring on themſelves that very deſtruction which they thought to avoid.</p>
               <p n="51">51. And this ſpake he not of himſelf: but being high Prieſt that year, he propheſied that Jeſus ſhould die for that nation: 52. And not for that nation only, but that alſo he ſhould gather together in one, the children of God that were ſcattered abroad.</p>
               <p rend="small">51. And though he meant this of ſaving them from the <hi>Romans</hi> though by injuſtice, yet he being Prieſt that year (though by unlawful entrance by the <hi>Roman</hi> Power) God honoured the office ſo far as to make him utter thoſe words, which ſhould be a juſt Propheſie as meant by God, though not by him: And ſhould ſignifie that Chriſts death ſhould tend to the converſion al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the choſen people of God in all the Gentile world, who ſhould thereby be made his Children, and one Church.</p>
               <p n="53">53. Then from that day forth, they took counſel together for to put him to death.</p>
               <p rend="small">53. The greateſt Miracle and good Work of Chriſt fixed their reſolution to murder him.</p>
               <p n="54">54. Jeſus therefore walked no more open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly among the Jews; but went thence unto a country near to the wilderneſs, into a city called Ephraim, and there continued with his diſciples.</p>
               <p rend="small">54. N. Chriſt yet fled from perſecution, and ſpent moſt of the three years and a half of his publick Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry among remote poor people in <hi>Galilee</hi> or near the Wilderneſs.</p>
               <p rend="small">N. <hi>Qu.</hi> It's ſtrange that <hi>Matthew, Mark</hi> and <hi>Luke</hi> ſay nothing of this great Miracle.</p>
               <p rend="small">
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. No one was to ſay all: but altogether to ſay ſufficient. 2. And <hi>John</hi> tells us that even altogether, have ſaid but little of all that Chriſt ſaid and did: but only ſo much as ſhould be enough to convince unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers.</p>
               <p rend="small">
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> Where was <hi>Lazarus</hi>'s ſoul while he was dead? If in heaven, was it not a wrong to him to come thence? And did he remember what he ſaw there? and tell it to any? If not, doth it not make for the ſleepy inacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of Souls departed? <hi>Anſ.</hi> Souls go not to Heaven, by neceſſitation, as a ſtone deſcendeth; but are diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of by God as the Supream Governour; thoſe that are for Heaven to Heaven, and thoſe that ſerve De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils to the Devils: and thoſe that are not yet judg'd to either, but are to live preſently again on earth (as <hi>Lazarus</hi> and others raiſed) are reſerved by God accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, whether yet in the body (as in a ſwoun) or near it, or where God pleaſed, and vouchſaſed no other knowledg and memory than is meet for ſuch as are to revive and live yet on Earth.</p>
               <p n="55">55. And the Jews paſſover was nigh at hand: and many went out of the country up to Jeruſalem before the paſſover, to purifie themſelves.</p>
               <p rend="small">55. The legally unclean were not to celebrate the Paſſover.</p>
               <p n="56">56. Then ſought they for Jeſus, and ſpake among themſelves, as they ſtood in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, What think ye, that he will not come to the feaſt?</p>
               <p rend="small">56. For all were bound to come to it, that were not unavoidably hindered.</p>
               <p n="57">57. Now both the chief Prieſts and the Phariſees had given a commandment, that if any man knew where he were, he ſhould ſhew it, that they might take him.</p>
               <p rend="small">57. N. 1. Chriſts Miniſters uſe Gods Ordinances to ſave men, and the Devils Clergy uſe them for ſnares, miſchief and murder. 2. They will not let the people be neuters between God and the Devil, but force them to be informing Perſecutors.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XII.</head>
               <p>THEN Jeſus, ſix days before the paſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, came to Bethany, where Lazarus was which had been dead, whom he raiſed from the dead. 2. There they made him a Supper, and Martha ſerved: but Lazarus was one of them that ſat at the table with him.</p>
               <p rend="small">1. N. 1, Chriſt was not againſt feſtival entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. 2. This is the ſame Hiſtory mentioned, <hi>Luk.</hi> 10. Where you may ſee more of it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Then took Mary a pound of ointment, of ſpikenard, very coſtly, and anointed the feet of Jeſus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the houſe was filled with the odor of the ointment.</p>
               <p rend="small">3. N. 1. It is not unlike that ſuch an action was twice done, that is, by two ſeveral <hi>Mary</hi>'s; and that this is not the ſame with that <hi>Luke</hi> 7. But yet it is very hard to judge where this was done: that it was thrice done is not probable: And that it was done in the houſe of <hi>Simon</hi> the Leper other Evangeliſts notifie: yet here it ſeemeth to have been done in <hi>Martha</hi>'s own houſe, compar'd with <hi>Luke</hi> 10. I'ts moſt likely to me that <hi>Simon</hi> and <hi>Martha</hi> dwelling in the ſame Village at <hi>Bethany</hi> joyned their Purſes and Labour and feaſted him in <hi>Simons</hi> houſe where this anointing was done: But that he was alſo entertained at <hi>Martha</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi>'s houſe, where that was done, which is recorded, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Then ſaid one of his diſciples, Judas
<pb facs="tcp:66325:97"/>
Iſcariot, Simons ſon, which ſhould betray him. 5. Why was not this ointment ſold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor?</p>
               <p rend="small">4, 5. N. That as Piety is oft pretended by hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites againſt Charity, ſo is Charity here by <hi>Judas</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Piety: And there is no work ſo good but may be oppoſed by very fair pretences.</p>
               <p n="6">6. This he ſaid, not that he cared for the poor; but becauſe he was a thief, and had the bag, and bare what was put therein.</p>
               <p rend="small">6. <hi>Judas</hi> being Purſe-bearer, falſly pretended a care of the poor, for his ſelfiſh covetouſneſs.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Then ſaid Jeſus, Let her alone: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the day of my burial hath ſhe kept this. 8. For the poor always ye have with you; but me ye have not always.</p>
               <p rend="small">7. This which ſhe gave ſhall be as it were for my fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral embalming; that may be beſt on ſuch an extroar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary occaſion which ordinarily is not ſo. You may always give to the poor.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there: and they came, not for Jeſus ſake only, but that they might ſee Lazarus alſo, whom he had raiſed from the dead. 10. But the chief Prieſts conſulted, that they might put Lazarus alſo to death. 11. Becauſe that by reaſon of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jeſus.</p>
               <p rend="small">9. N. To be put to death by ſuch wicked Prieſts and Rulers, is no diſhonour or note of guilt in the ſufferer. 2. We ſee here how much <hi>Dives</hi> was deceived, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. That thought his brethren would have been perſwaded by <hi>Lazarus</hi> ſent from the dead: It's like they would have indicted him for a <hi>Scandalum Magnatum,</hi> or put him to death again.</p>
               <p n="12">12. On the next day, much people that was come to the feaſt, when they heard that Jeſus was coming to Jeruſalem. 13. Took branches of palm-trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried, Hoſanna, bleſſed is the King of Iſrael that cometh in the name of the Lord.</p>
               <p rend="small">12, 13. They honoured him by this applauding ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity, as the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> ſent from God to be the King of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="14">14. And Jeſus when he had found a young aſs, he ſat thereon; as it is written, 15. Fear not, daughter of Sion: behold, thy King cometh ſitting on an aſſes colt.</p>
               <p rend="small">14, 15. Thus <hi>Zach.</hi> 9.9. Was fulfilled.</p>
               <p n="16">16. Theſe things underſtood not his diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples at the firſt, but when Jeſus was glorified, then remembred they that theſe things were written of him, and that they had done theſe things unto him.</p>
               <p rend="small">16. N. Many things are ſaid and done by Chriſt, which ſhall not be preſently underſtood, but in their ſeaſon.</p>
               <p n="17">17. The people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of his grave, and raiſed him from the dead, bare record. 18. For this cauſe the people alſo met him, for that they heard that he had done this miracle.</p>
               <p rend="small">17, 18. N. It was the people that had ſeen and heard of his raiſing <hi>Lazarus,</hi> that there met him as King with <hi>Hoſanna</hi>'s.</p>
               <p n="19">19. The Phariſees therefore ſaid among themſelves, perceive ye how ye prevail no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing? behold, the world is gone after him.</p>
               <p rend="small">19. N. They thought their danger immanent, that the people would proclaim him King, and then the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> would deſtroy their Country as Rebels; for they could not truſt God to ſave them from the <hi>Romans,</hi> though Miracles ſhould have taught it them.</p>
               <p n="20">20. And there were certain Greeks a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, that came up to worſhip at the feaſt:</p>
               <p rend="small">20. Theſe <hi>Greeks</hi> were not the Jews of <hi>Alexandriae</hi> that uſed the <hi>Greek</hi> tongue, (elſewhere called <hi>Greeks</hi>) but the Proſelites of the <hi>Gates,</hi> who worſhipped but as <hi>Catechumens</hi> did with Chriſtians.</p>
               <p n="21">21. The ſame came therefore to Philip, which was of Bethſaida of Galilee, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired him, ſaying, Sir, we would ſee Jeſus. 22. Philip cometh and telleth Andrew: and again Andrew and Philip told Jeſus. 23. And Jeſus anſwered them, ſaying, the hour is come, that the Son of man ſhall be glorified. 24. Verily, verily I ſay unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground, and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit.</p>
               <p rend="small">21. When <hi>Greeks</hi> by the ſame of Chriſts Miracles deſired to ſee him, he tells them, that indeed the time of his glory in the world by mens believing on him, was at hand: But that he muſt die firſt, and then the Catholick Church ſhould be gathered. A grain of Wheat is ſaid to die, becauſe the diſſolution and change maketh it no longer a grain of Wheat, but the ſeed of many new grains with the Straw.</p>
               <p n="25">25. He that loveth his life, ſhall loſe it, and he that hateth his life in this world, ſhall keep it unto life eternal.</p>
               <p rend="small">
                  <pb facs="tcp:66325:97"/>25. And, as it is with me it will be with you: He that ſo overloveth his life, as that he cannot forſake it for my ſake and his Salvation, ſhall loſe it by keeping of it: And he that caſteth it away as men do a hated thing, rather than deny me and ſin, ſhall live for ever.</p>

               <p rend="small">1. The foreknowledge of his approaching departure to the Father, cauſed him in this ſpecial manner to ſhew his love to his diſciples.</p>

He riſeth from Supper, and laid aſide his garments, and took a tower and girded himſelf. 5. After that he powred water into a baſon and began to waſh the diſciples feet, and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded.</p>
               <p rend="small">3. Jeſus knowing that he was preſently to take poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of his univerſal dominion, and return to God from whom he came, did humble himſelf to this work of <hi>LOVE</hi> and <hi>SERVICE,</hi> for an example to them; He riſeth from Supper, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p rend="small">N. What is meant by Chriſts coming from God, is before opened.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Then cometh he to Simon Peter: and Peter ſaith unto him, Lord, doeſt thou waſh my feet. 7. Jeſus anſwered and ſaid unto him What I do thou knoweſt not now, but thou ſhalt know hereafter.</p>

Chriſt waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all that have part in him from the guilt and filth of ſin. 3. It's lawful and a duty to change a purpoſe taken up upon miſtakes, and to break that word which did but expreſs ſuch a purpoſe: There are three ſorts of affirming words. 1. <hi>Aſſertious</hi> ſaying, <hi>This or that is true,</hi> or is <hi>not true</hi>: To violate theſe wilfully is Lying; and in witneſs bearing it is a heynous Sin.

               <p rend="small">3. There is a Pollicitation, or rather, a bare utte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of a mans reſolution, As [<hi>This or that I will do or give,</hi> &amp;c.] This ever in all rational men ſuppoſeth many conditions, As [if God will] [if <hi>I live and be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi>] [If the change of things alter not my caſe.] If I find not my Reaſon miſtaken, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] No Chriſtian may be ſuppoſed to ſay [I will do this whether God will or not: whether I live or die: whatever befal me, or though I find that my Reaſon is an error: As in all ſuch caſes it is a duty to change a reſolution, ſo it is a duty to go againſt that word by which we expreſt our Reſolution: to change mind<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> word and work for the better, is a duty.

If you not only know this but do it, you ſhall be bleſſed in your reward: But if you pretend learning and knowledge and neglect this work, your guilt and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry will be double.</p>
               <p n="18">18. I ſpeak not of you all, I know whom I have choſen: but that the Scripture may be fulfilled, He that eateth bread with me, hath lift up his heel againſt me.</p>

               <p n="22">22. Then the diſciples looked one on ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, doubting of whom he ſpake.</p>
               <p rend="small">22. They were troubled, and were thinking who this ſhould be.</p>
               <p n="23">23. Now there was leaning on Jeſus bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, one of his diſciples, whom Jeſus loved. 24.

As his hypocriſie and thieving and coveteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs gave Satan power over him before, ſo now upon his obdurateneſs after all warnings; he had greater power to hurry him to the execution. And Chriſt by ſaying [what thou doſt do quickly] intimated to him that he knew his mind.</p>
               <p n="28">28. Now no man at the table knew for what intent he ſpake this unto him.</p>
               <p rend="small">28. None of them (unleſs perhaps <hi>John</hi>) under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood what he meant.</p>

               <p n="14">14. Ye are my friends, if ye do whatſoever I command you.</p>
               <p rend="small">14. I lay down my life for you, and that as for my beloved friends who ſhall enjoy my friendly Love for ever, if you prove my friends indeed: and that muſt be by doing whatſoever I command you, and not by bare words and boaſts of friendſhip.</p>
               <p n="15">15. Henceforth I call you not ſervants; for the ſervant knoweth not what his Lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father, I have made known unto you.</p>
               <p rend="small">15. Though you are my Servants, I have a higher name to call you by, even my Friends: For meer Service ſignifieth not that endeared intimacy which I have uſed with you. LOVE and Friendſhip is higher than meer Service and Obedience. I have made known to you the Myſteries of God, which ſignifie my Love of friendſhip.</p>
               <p n="16">16. Ye have not choſen me, but I have choſen you, and ordained you, that you ſhould go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit ſhould remain: that whatſoever ye ſhall aſk of the Father in my name, he may give it you.</p>
               <p rend="small">16. You did not firſt begin in Love to me, and chooſe me for your Saviour, but I began in Love of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence to you, and choſe you to be my Friends the Objects of my Complacency: And ordained you to be my Apoſtles to Convert the World, that you may ſee the Catholick Church gathered as the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led fruit of your Labours. And that whatever Power you ask of God, by Miracles or other Gifts to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote your Labour he may give it you.</p>
               <p n="17">17. Theſe things I command you, that ye love one another.</p>
               <p rend="small">17. I mention all this to you to enforce my laſt and great Command, that ye love one another. <hi>Note,</hi> Alas how far are the Accuſing, Slandering, Reviling, Backbiting and Perſecuting Teachers, Rulers and Sects, from the Nature and Practice of this Love, which Chriſt ſo vehemently urgeth.</p>
               <p n="18">18. If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated you.</p>
               <p rend="small">18. When you meet with hatred from ungodly Men, remember that I that am the Son of God and never ſinned, was hated by them before you, and you do but follow me, and ſuffer for and with me.</p>
               <p n="19">19. If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but becauſe ye are not of the world, but I have choſen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.</p>
               <p rend="small">19. If you were meer ungodly Wordlings or Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels, the World would not hate you for Godlineſs or Faith, but love you for being like them. But they hate you for that Chriſtian Excellency in which my choſen ones excell them: And would you not be Better and Happier than they, though you be hated for it.</p>
               <p n="20">20. Remember the word that I ſaid unto you, The ſervant is not greater then the Lord. If they have perſecuted me, they will alſo perſecute you: if they have kept my ſaying, they will keep yours alſo.</p>
               <p rend="small">20. If you take me for your Lord indeed, remember that I have told you that you are not greater than I, and look for no better uſage of the World than I have found: If they have Perſecuted me, they will Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute you: And if the unbelieving Part reject my Word, wonder not if they do ſo by yours, and if the choſen only do receive it.</p>
               <p n="21">21. But all theſe things will they do unto you for my names ſake, becauſe they know not him that ſent me.</p>
               <p rend="small">
                  <pb facs="tcp:66325:101"/>21. It is for my ſake that they will Perſecute you, becauſe they know not God and his Teſtimony of me.</p>
               <p n="22">22. If I had not come, and ſpoken unto them, they had not had ſin: but now they have no cloke for their ſin.</p>
               <p rend="small">22. If I had not ſpoken to them and confirmed my Word by my Works their ſin had not been ſo great, but had excuſe (<hi>Note,</hi> Here [not had Sin] a Poſitive is put for a Comparative): Or if I had not come with ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient evidence, it had not been their ſin not to believe me to be the Chriſt: But now their unbelief and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution hath no pretence.</p>
               <p n="23">23. He that hateth me, hateth my Father alſo.</p>
               <p rend="small">23. The hatred that is againſt me, is conſequently againſt God my Father, it being his Word, Works and Witneſs which they reject.</p>
               <p n="24">24. If I had not done among them the works which none other man did, they had not had ſin: but now have they both ſeen, and hated both me and my Father.</p>
               <p rend="small">24. They had not been bound to believe me to be the Chriſt, if I had not ſhewed Gods Atteſtation, ſuch works as no man elſe can do, or if any one had done the like. <hi>Note,</hi> Yet it is a falſe inference of the Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels, that therefore none are bound to take him for the Chriſt, where he never came and did ſuch works: For Hiſtory may as infallibly tranſmit the notice of his Works, as Sight and Hearing could receive them.</p>
               <p n="25">25. But this cometh to paſs, that the word might be fulfilled that is written in their Law, They hated me without a cauſe.</p>
               <p rend="small">25. But the Word written in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 3.19. which in a large ſenſe is part of their Law is thus ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled.</p>
               <p n="26">26. But when the Comforter is come, whom I will ſend unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which procedeth from the Father, he ſhall teſtifie of me.</p>
               <p rend="small">26. But when the Holy Ghoſt my Advocate and your Comforter is ſent down upon you, whom after my Reſurrection I will ſend to you, for his Eminent ſignal Gifts, from the Father<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> even that Holy Spirit of Truth which proceedeth from the Father, he ſhall be my great Prevailing Witneſs both to you, and by you to the World, and ſhall cauſe belief.</p>

               <p rend="small">27. And you on whom this Spirit ſhall come down, ſhall by his operation be made my effectual Witneſſes, of what I have ſaid and done and ſuffered, becauſe you have been with me, as Eye and Ear Witneſſes from the beginning of my publick Miniſtration.</p>

               <p rend="small">7. They have known this Fundamentally, that I and my Doctrine and Works are all of thee.</p>
               <p n="8">8. For I have given unto them the words which thou gaveſt me; and they received them, and have known ſurely that I came out from thee, and they have believed that thou didſt ſend me.</p>
               <p rend="small">8. Note that Chriſt inſiſteth ſo much on this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe to believe that he and his doctrine and Works are all of God, is virtually to believe, that they are all true without ſearching after any other Reaſon of yours. For he is mad that believeth not that there is a God, and he believeth not a God who believeth him not to be perfect, and therefore to be Juſt, Good and True, and not the Deceiver of the World.</p>
               <p n="9">9. I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them which thou haſt given me, for they are thine. 10. And all mine are thine, and thine are mine, and I am glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified in them.</p>
               <p rend="small">9, 10. It is out of ſpecial Love to them, for the Salvation and welfare of theſe, that I now pray to thee, and not for the meer Worldlings and Enemies of thy Kingdom, (though for them alſo I have ſuch deſires and Prayers as ſignifie my common Love; and the Elect among them yet unconverted, I have ſuch requeſts for, as are ſuited to their ſtate.) But theſe that thou haſt given me peremptorily to ſave, are the People of of thy peculiar Love as well as mine. And all that I ſo Love thou loveſt alſo, and it is in them that I am glorified and my Perſon, Office and Grace is honoured, which others do but Swiniſhly deſpiſe.</p>
               <p n="11">11. And now I am no more in the world, but theſe are in the world and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep through thine own name, thoſe whom thou haſt given me, that they may be one, as we are.</p>

               <p n="12">12. While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name: thoſe that thou gaveſt me I have kept, and none of them is loſt, but the ſon of perdition: that the ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture might be fulfilled.</p>
               <p rend="small">12. All that thou gaveſt to be my adherent follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, I have kept in thy Name, ſave the Son of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, in whoſe Revolt and Treachery the Scripture is fulfilled.</p>
               <p n="13">13. And now come I to thee, and theſe things I ſpeak in the world, that they might have my joy fulfilled in themſelves.</p>
               <p rend="small">13. I Come to thee, but I leave them my Word, to fortifie them with that joy which they will need in their Afflictions.</p>
               <p n="14">14. I have given them thy word; and the world hath hated them, becauſe they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.</p>
               <p rend="small">14. It is not all the World that will be ſaved by me, but a ſelect People to whom I effectually give thy Word, and the World hateth them, becauſe their Doctrine, Mind and Life do differ from the World, and they are of another Spirit and Society of which I am the Head.</p>

               <p rend="small">1. This Sermon and Prayer being ſpoken after the

Sacrament, Jeſus went to the Garden where he knew he ſhould be apprehended: <hi>Judas</hi> knew the place, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Chriſt oft went thither, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Judas then having received a band of men, and officers from the cheif prieſts and Phariſes, cometh thither with lanterns, and torchees, and weapons.</p>
               <p rend="small">3. Note, <hi>Judas</hi> was the Informer that led the Officers (ſuch as Conſtables,) and the Chief Prieſts and the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees of their party were they that (like Juſtices) fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed them with Commiſſions and Armed men.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Jeſus therefore knowing all things that ſhould come upon him, went forth, and ſaid unto them, Whom ſeek ye? 5. They an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered him, Jeſus of Nazareth. Jeſus ſaith unto them, I am he. And Judas alſo which betrayed him, ſtood with them.</p>
               <p rend="small">5, 6. <hi>Note,</hi> Chriſt fled not when his hour was come. 2. What a ſtony heart had <hi>Judas</hi> all this while.</p>
               <p n="6">6. As ſoon then as he had ſaid unto them, I am he, they went backward and fell to the ground.</p>
               <p rend="small">6. Some of them went backward and fell. <hi>Note,</hi> This ſtopt not them or their Companions.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Then aſked he them again, whom ſeek ye? And they ſaid, Jeſus of Nazareth. 8. Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus anſwered, I have told you that I am he. If therefore ye ſeek me, let theſe go their way: 9. That the ſaying might be fulfilled which he ſpake, Of them which thou gaveſt me, have I loſt none.</p>
               <p rend="small">7, 8, 9. <hi>Note,</hi> Chriſt was careful for the Bodily ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his Diſciples till their hour came. 2. His words of <hi>Looſing none,</hi> are here Expounded as reaching to the body as well as to the Soul.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Then Simon Peter having a ſword, drew it, and ſmote the high prieſts ſervant, and cut off his right ear. The ſervants name was Malchus. 11. Then ſaid Jeſus unto Peter, Put up thy ſword unto the ſheath: the cup which my Father hath given me, ſhall I not drink it?</p>
               <p rend="small">10, 11. <hi>Note, Peter</hi> that before truſted too much to his own conſtancy, now truſteth too much to his Sword, without Commiſſion. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Chriſt would not be reſcued from his undertaken ſufferings by humane ſtrength.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Then the band, and the captain, and officers of the Jews took Jeſus, and bound him.</p>
               <p rend="small">12. The Colonel with his Soldiers and the Officers, bind Jeſus as as a Malefactor; being ſlaviſh Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners.</p>
               <p n="13">13. And led him away to Annas firſt (for he was father in law to Caiaphas, which was the high prieſt that ſame year.) 14. Now Caiaphas was he which gave counſel to the Jews, that it was expedient that one man ſhould die for the people.</p>
               <p rend="small">13. The Power was in <hi>Caiaphas,</hi> but his Father in Law was made the way to him, no doubt being a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Actor.</p>
               <p n="15">15. And Simon Peter followed Jeſus, and ſo did another Diſciple. That Diſciple was known unto the high prieſt, and went in with Jeſus into the palace of the high prieſt. 16. But Peter ſtood at the door without. Then went out that other Diſciple which was known unto the high prieſt, and ſpake unto her that kept the door, and brought in Peter.</p>
               <p rend="small">15. <hi>Note,</hi> It ſeems acquaintance made them bear with <hi>John,</hi> and yet pretended they knew him not to be a Diſciple.</p>
               <p n="17">17. Then ſaith the Damſel that kept the door, unto Peter, Art not thou alſo one of this mans diſciples? He ſaith, I am not. 18. And the Servants and Officers ſtood there, who had made a fire of coals (for it was cold) and they warmed themſelves: and Peter ſtood with them, and warmed himſelf.</p>
               <p rend="small">17, 18. <hi>Note,</hi> Whenever we have buſineſs in bad Company, we ſhould foreſee what Temptations, we may there expect, and be forewarned.</p>
               <p n="19">19. The high prieſt then asked Jeſus of his diſciples, and of his doctrine.</p>
               <p rend="small">19. <hi>N.</hi> The Perverſion and Confuſion of this blinded World, Man Examineth and Judgeth God: An igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant High Prieſt who pretendeth to no honour, but to be an Officer of God judgeth his Maſter.</p>
               <p n="20">20. Jeſus anſwered him, I ſpake openly to the world; I ever taught in the Synagogues and in the Temple, whither the Jews always reſort, and in ſecret have I ſaid nothing, 21. Why askeſt thou me? ask them which heard me, what I have ſaid unto them: behold, they know what I ſaid.</p>
               <p rend="small">20, 21. <hi>Note,</hi> Chriſt that came to die for our ſins, yet would not accuſe himſelf but refe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <pb facs="tcp:66325:104"/>
Thirdly, Chriſt did not ſeparate from the Temple or Synagogue, and yet they could not bear him while he put them but to prove their accuſations; they expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that his obedience to their demands ſhould have furniſhed their Malice with matter againſt him, while they were breaking Gods Commands.</p>
               <p n="22">22. And when he had thus ſpoken one of the officers which ſtood by, ſtroke Jeſus with the palm of his hand, ſaying, Anſwereſt thou the high prieſt ſo?</p>
               <p rend="small">22. <hi>Note,</hi> It is no wonder if wicked High Prieſts have wicked Officers, ready to ſay and do as they. Rebels againſt God charge God himſelf for not obeying them in iniquity; and expect more than due ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from Gods Servants while they were againſt God himſelf.</p>
               <p n="23">23. Jeſus anſwered him, If I have ſpoken evil, bear witneſs of the evil: but if well, why ſmiteſt thou me?</p>
               <p rend="small">23. If I have by my anſwer broken the Law, prove it: If not, why art thou Executioner without Tryal or deſert.</p>
               <p n="24">24. (Now Annas had ſent him bound unto Caiaphas the high Prieſt.) 25. And Simon Peter ſtood and warmed himſelf: They ſaid therefore unto him, Art not thou alſo one of his diſciples? He denied it, and ſaid, I am not. 26. One of the ſervants of the high Prieſt, (being his kinſman whoſe ear Peter cut off) ſaith, Did not I ſee thee in the garden with him? 27. Peter then denied again, and immediately the Cock crew.</p>
               <p rend="small">24, 25, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All this was done in <hi>Caiphas</hi> houſe whither <hi>Annas</hi> had ſent Chriſt bound. There <hi>Peter</hi> then denied Chriſt: Though one denyal be here omitted.</p>
               <p n="28">28. Then led they Jeſus from Caiaphas, unto the hall of Judgment: And it was Early, and they themſelves went not into the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-hall leſt they ſhould be defiled: but that they might eat the Paſſover.</p>
               <p rend="small">28. <hi>Note,</hi> Thus That Hypocrite Prieſts make Conſcience of a Ceremony, while they are ſhedding holy Blood.</p>
               <p n="29">29. Pilate then went out unto them, and ſaid, What accuſation bring you againſt this man? 30. They anſwered and ſaid unto him, If he were not a malefactour, we would not have delivered him up unto thee.</p>
               <p rend="small">29, 30. <hi>Note,</hi> The wicked Prieſts expected that <hi>Pilate</hi> ſhould have taken their bare word againſt Chriſt to Condemns him.</p>
               <p n="31">31. Then ſaid Pilate unto them, Take ye him and judge him according to your Law. The Jews therefore ſaid unto him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death: 32. That the ſaying of Jeſus might be fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, which he ſpake, ſignifying what death he ſhould die.</p>
               <p rend="small">31, 32. If he muſt be Condemned upon your bare word, be you the Judges of him by your own Law: For the <hi>Rommans</hi> uſe not to Condemn men ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly.</p>
               <p rend="small">
                  <hi>Note,</hi> The <hi>Romans</hi> having Conquered the <hi>Jews,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them the uſe of their Law for leſſer puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but not for death (though ſome think other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe:) Crucifying was the <hi>Roman</hi> puniſhment.</p>
               <p n="33">33. Then Pilate entred into the judgment-hall again, and called Jeſus, and ſaid unto him, Art thou the king of the Jews? 34. Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus anſwered him, Sayeſt thou this thing of thy ſelf, or did others tell it thee of me?</p>
               <p rend="small">34. I perceive thy queſtion implyeth accuſation: Who is the Accuſer? Is it thy ſelf or any other.</p>
               <p n="35">35. Pilate anſwered, Am I a Jew? Thine own nation, and the chief Prieſts have delivered thee unto me: What haſt thou done?</p>
               <p rend="small">35. I am no <hi>Jew,</hi> nor Judge of your Propheſies, pretences and quarrels; It is thy own Nation and thoſe that ſhould beſt underſtand the matters of it, even the High Prieſt that have delivered thee to me: How haſt thou offended them.</p>
               <p n="36">36. Jeſus anſwered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my ſervants fight, that I ſhould not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence.</p>
               <p rend="small">36. I know it is as the Uſurper of the Crown againſt <hi>Caeſar</hi> that they intend to accuſe me: But of that they have no juſt cauſe: For it is no Earthly Kingdome that I claim; nor do I raiſe Men to fight for me, as I ſhould do if I claimed an Earthly Kingdom.</p>
               <p n="37">37. Pilate therefore ſaid unto him, Art thou a king then? Jeſus anſwered, Thou ſayeſt that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cauſe came I into the world, that I ſhould bear witneſs unto the truth: every one that is of the truth, heareth my voice. 38. Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late ſaith unto him, What is truth?</p>
               <p rend="small">37. And art thou a King indeed. Jeſus anſwered, <hi>I am a King,</hi> (though I claim no mans Crown) it was to this end that I was born and came into the World, that the Truth might Reign, and that I might Reign in the Minds of Men by the Light of Truth: And eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one that is thus enlightned to obey the Truth, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyeth

               <p>And when he had ſaid this, he went out again unto the Jews, and ſaith unto them, I find in him no fault at all.</p>
               <p rend="small">38. I find not that he breaketh any of our Laws, by any capital Crime.</p>
               <p n="39">39. But ye have a cuſtom, that I ſhould releaſe unto you one at the paſſover: will ye therefore that I releaſe unto you the king of the Jews? 40. Then cried they all again, ſaying Not this man, But Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber.</p>
               <p rend="small">39. Note, <hi>Pilate</hi> derided Chriſt, but was loth to murder him, judging him innocent.</p>

                  <hi>Note,</hi> Whereas other Writers of the Goſpel oft tell us that Chriſt anſwered not a word, and <hi>John</hi> tells us of his moſt pertinent Anſwers, it only ſignifieth that to many other Queſtions not here mentioned, he gave no Anſwer; and that he forbore partly as ſeeing it was in vain with ſuch unrighteous Men, and being not over regardful of ſelf defence, and partly that he might not give them matter againſt him, wreſted from his own words: But the anſwers omitted by others <hi>John</hi> reeiteth.</p>

               <p n="4">4. Pilate therefore went forth again, and ſaith unto them, Behold, I bring him forth to you, that ye may know that I find no fault in him. 5. Then came Jeſus forth, wearing the crown of thorns, and the purple robe. And Pilate ſaith unto them, Behold the man.</p>
               <p rend="small">4. In Scorn.</p>
               <p n="6">6. When the cheif prieſts therefore and officers ſaw him, they cried out, ſaying, Crucifie him, Crucifie him. Pilate ſaith unto them, Take ye him, and Crucifie him: for I find no fault in him.</p>
               <p rend="small">6. Thus Chriſt is the Foot-ball of Cruelty and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Scorn. <hi>Pilate</hi> ſaith, let it be your own dowing if you will needs have it done, for by our Law he deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth it not.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The Jews anſwered him, We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, becauſe he made himſelf the Son of God. 8. When Pilate therefore heard that ſaying; he was the more afraid; 9. And wenr again into the judgment-hall, and ſaith unto Jeſus, Whence art thou? But Jeſus gave him no anſwer.</p>
               <p rend="small">7, 8, 9. <hi>Note,</hi> The Name of the <hi>Son of God,</hi> was uſed by the Prieſts againſt Chriſt to accuſe and Murder him, and yet to a Heathen Judge cauſed fear and further enquiry: And to this day it is matter of Scorn to ſuch that the Faithful are called the Children of God.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Then ſaith Pilate unto him, Speakeſt thou not unto me? knoweſt thou not that I have power to Crucifie thee, and have power to releaſe thee? 11. Jeſus anſwered, Thou couldeſt have no power at all againſt me, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it were given thee from above: therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath the greater ſin.</p>
               <p rend="small">10. <hi>Note,</hi> 1. Chriſt would not tell him whence he was by Words, that would not know it by his Works. 2. <hi>Pilate</hi> thought that the power of Life and Death, ſhould have forced Jeſus to anſwer him. And Chriſt ſaith [whatever Proud men may claim or pretend to, no man can have more Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Right or Authority than God the abſolute Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign giveth him (who giveth none againſt himſelf) Therefore the Arch-Prieſts that deliver me to thee to be Crucified, are ſo much the greater Sinners that would turn Gods Ordinances of Magiſtracy againſt himſelf.</p>
               <p n="12">12. And from thenceforth Pilate ſought to releaſe him: but the Jews cried out, ſaying, If thou let this man go, thou art not Ceſars friend, whoſoever maketh himſelf a King, ſpeaketh againſt Ceſar.</p>
               <p rend="small">12. Then the Prieſts uſed that Argument with <hi>Pilate</hi> which he had not ſtrength to overcome; as if they would queſtion his Life or Office, as a Traytor to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> if he would not Condemn Chriſt as ſuch. Though Chriſt had told him that he pretended not to a Kingdom of this World; yet for the Name of a King either Chriſt muſt die as an Enemy to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> or <hi>Pilate</hi> go for ſuch. Thus though all Royal Authority be of God, yet it is oft the ſtrength and moſt prevailing Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, that Wicked men uſe againſt God and his Law and Servants.</p>
               <p n="13">13. When Pilate therefore heard that ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he brought Jeſus forth, and ſat down in the judgment-ſeat, in a place that is called
<pb facs="tcp:66325:105"/>
the Pavement, but in the Hebrew, Gabba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha. 14. And it was the preparation of the paſſover, and about the ſixth hour: and he ſaith unto the Jews, Behold your King. 15. But they cried out, Away with him, away with him, Crucifie him. Pilate ſaith unto them, Shall I Crucifie your King? The Chief Prieſts anſwered, we have no King but Ceſar.</p>
               <p rend="small">13. When Pilate ſaw that there was no reſiſting them without danger to himſelf, he ſate in Judgment on Chriſt in a place called in the Syriack <hi>Gabbatha.</hi>

               <p rend="small">

               <p n="16">16. Then delivered he him therefore unto them to be Crucified. And they took Jeſus and led him away. 17. And he bearing his Croſs, went forth unto a place called the place of a ſcull, which is called in the Hebrew, Golgotha.</p>
               <p rend="small">17. He bare his Croſs (till his ſtrength failed and then they made <hi>Simon</hi> of <hi>Cyrene</hi> to bear it) to a place called in Syriack <hi>Golgotha,</hi> or the place of a Skul.</p>
               <p n="18">18. Where they Crucified him, and two other with him, on either ſide one, and Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus in the midſt. 19. And Pilate wrote a title, and put it on the croſs. And the writing was, JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS.</p>
               <p rend="small">18, 19. <hi>Note,</hi> The Title ſignified his accuſation.</p>
               <p n="20">20. This title then read many of the Jews: for the place where Jeſus was Crucified was nigh to the city: and it was written in He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew, and Greek, and Latine.</p>
               <p rend="small">20. Written in <hi>Syriack</hi> or <hi>Chaldee</hi> words with <hi>Hebrew</hi> Letters, and in <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="21">21. Then ſaid the chief prieſts of the Jews to Pilate, Write not, The King of the Jews; but that he ſaid, I am King of the Jews. 22. Pilate anſwered, What I have written, I have written.</p>
               <p rend="small">21, 22. The Title which <hi>Pilate</hi> made in Scorn, and God over ruled as real Truth, diſpleaſed the Arch-Prieſts: but <hi>Pilate</hi> would not alter it.</p>
               <p n="23">23. Then the Souldiers, when they had Crucified Jeſus, took his garments (and made four parts, to every ſouldier a part) and alſo his coat: now the coat was without ſeam, woven from the top throughout. 24. They ſaid therefore among themſelves, Let us not rent it, but caſt lots for it, whoſe it ſhall be: that the ſcripture might be fulfilled, which ſaith, They parted my raiment among them, and for my veſture they did caſt lots. Theſe things therefore the ſouldiers did.</p>
               <p rend="small">23. Not that the Propheſie made them do it, but was fullfilled by their doing it.</p>
               <p n="25">25. Now there ſtood by the croſs of Jeſus, his mother, and his mothers ſiſter, Mary the wife of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene. 26. When Jeſus therefore ſaw his mother, and the diſciple ſtanding by, whom he loved, he ſaith unto his mother, Woman, behold thy ſon. 27. Then ſaith he to the diſciple, Behold thy Mother. And from that hour that diſciple took her unto his own home.</p>
               <p rend="small">25, 26, 27. <hi>Note,</hi> Chriſt on the Croſs had a care of his Mothers future comfort in the World: which conſiſted in her Entertainment and Converſe with his beloved Diſciple.</p>
               <p n="28">28. After this, Jeſus knowing that all things were now accompliſhed, that the ſcripture might be fulfilled, ſaith I thirſt. 29. Now there was ſet a veſſel full of vinegar: and they filled a Spunge with Vinegar, and put it upon hyſſop, and put it to his mouth. 30. When Jeſus therefore had received the vinegar, he ſaid, It is finiſhed: and he bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his head, and gave up the ghoſt.</p>
               <p rend="small">28. As other Scriptures of him were fulfilled, ſo he would have that <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.22. And having drunk the Vinegar, he ſaid, my Sacrifice on the Croſs is perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the Prophecies of it fulfilled, and he bowed his Head and reſigned his Soul.</p>
               <p rend="small">Many paſſages are omitted by <hi>John</hi> becauſe written by others.</p>
               <p n="31">31. The Jews therefore, becauſe it was the preparation, that the bodies ſhould not remain upon the croſs on the Sabbath-day (for that Sabbath-day was an high day) beſought Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away. 32. Then came the ſouldiers, and brake the legs of the firſt, and of the other which was Crucified with him.</p>
               <p rend="small">31, 32. <hi>Note,</hi> What day it was, whether the Seventh

               <p n="33">33. But when they came to Jeſus, and ſaw that he was dead already, they brake not his legs. 34. But one of the ſouldiers with a ſpear pierced his ſide, and forthwith came there out bloud and water.</p>
               <p rend="small">33, 34. They made ſure ſince that he was dead!</p>
               <p n="35">35. And he that ſaw it, bare record, and his record is true: and he knoweth that he ſaith true, that ye might believe. 36. For theſe things were done, that the Scripture ſhould be fulfilled, A bone of him ſhall not be broken.</p>
               <p rend="small">35, 36. <hi>John</hi> that ſaw it is a true Witneſs. And that <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.20. which ſpeaketh Gods care of all his People, was ſpecially meant of Chriſt, whether <hi>David</hi> ſo underſtood it or not.</p>
               <p n="37">37. And again another Scripture ſaith, They ſhall look on him whom they pierced.</p>
               <p rend="small">37. Thus alſo that of <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.10. was fulfilled.</p>
               <p n="38">38. And after this, Joſeph of Arimathea (being a diſciple of Jeſus, but ſecretely for fear of the Jews) beſought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jeſus: And Pilate gave him leave: He came therefore and took the body of Jeſus.</p>
               <p rend="small">38. <hi>Joſeph</hi> that duiſt not own Chriſt openly alive, begs and obtaineth his body for burial.</p>
               <p n="39">39. And there came alſo Nicodemus (which at the firſt came to Jeſus by night) and brought a mixture of Myrrhe and Aloes; about an hundred pound weight. 40. Then took they the body of Jeſus, and wound it in linen cloths, with ſpices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury.</p>
               <p rend="small">39. The <hi>Mirrh</hi> and <hi>Aloes</hi> were to keep the Body from Putrefaction: but it ſeems they did for haſt (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing late) but rudely lay them to the body with the Cloaths, deferring the full Embalming till the firſt day of the week, when the Women came with Spices to have done it.</p>
               <p n="41">41. Now in the place were he was Crucified, there was a garden; and in the garden a new ſepulchre, wherein was never man yet laid. 42. There laid they Jeſus therefore, becauſe of the Jews preparation-day, for the ſepulchre was nigh at hand.</p>

               <p>THe firſt day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early when it was yet datk, unto the Sepulchre, and ſeeth the ſtone taken away from the Sepulchre.</p>
               <p rend="small">1. <hi>Mary</hi> and other Women firſt ſee it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Then ſhe runneth, and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the other Diſciple whom Jeſus loved, and ſaith unto them, They have taken away the Lord out of the Sepulchre, and we know not where they have laid him. 3. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter therefore went forth, and that other Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciple, and came to the Sepulcre. 4. So they ran both together: and the other Diſciple did outrun Peter, and came firſt to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre. 5. And he ſtouping down and looking in, ſaw the linen cloths lying; yet went he not in. 6. Then cometh Simon Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter following him, and went into the Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre, and ſeeth the linen clothes lye; 7. And the napkin that was about his head, not lying with the Linnen clothes, but wrapped together in a place by it ſelf. 8. Then went in alſo that other Diſciple which came firſt to the Sepulchre, and he ſaw, and believed.</p>
               <p rend="small">2, 3,<hi>&amp;c. Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> moved by <hi>Marys</hi> words, went and ſaw, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. For as yet they knew not the Scripture, that he muſt riſe again from the dead.</p>
               <p rend="small">9. Though the Scripture (and Chriſt himſelf often) foretold them his Reſurrection, they yet believed it not.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Then the Diſciples went away again unto their own home. 11. But Mary ſtood without at the Sepulchre, weeping: and as ſhee wept, ſhe ſtouped down and looked into the Sepulchre. 12. And ſeeth two Angels in white, ſitting, the one at the head, and the other at the feet, where the body of Jeſus had layen: 13. And they ſay unto her, Woman, why weepeſt thou? She ſaith unto them, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him.</p>
               <p rend="small">10, 11, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Though ſome Evangeliſts mentioned but one Angel, that denieth not that there were two, which is here affirmed.</p>
               <p n="14">
                  <pb facs="tcp:66325:106"/>14. And when ſhe had thus ſaid, ſhe turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her ſelf back, and ſaw Jeſus ſtanding, and knew not that it was Jeſus. 15. Jeſus ſaith unto her, Woman, why weepeſt thou? whom ſeekeſt thou? ſhe ſuppoſing him to be the Gardener, ſaith unto him, Sir, if thou have born him hence, tell me where thou haſt laid him, and I will take him away. 16. Jeſus ſaith, unto her, Mary. She turned her ſelf, and ſaith unto him, Rabboni, which is to ſay, Maſter.</p>
               <p rend="small">14. <hi>Not,</hi> Whether her not knowing him was not by reaſon of diſtance, darkneſs, or Chriſts not appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in full notoriety, is uncertain.

               <p n="17">17. Jeſus ſaith unto her, Touch me not: for I am not yet aſcended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and ſay unto them, I aſcend unto my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God.</p>

                  <hi>Note,</hi> That there ſeemeth a great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Evangeliſts in deſcribing theſe paſſages and appearances to the Women and Apoſtles: But it is but becauſe one leaveth out what another mentioneth but not that they contradict each other. And if you you take them altogether as one Hiſtory, the order ſeemeth to be this, Firſt, <hi>Mary Magdalen, Johanna Mary</hi> of <hi>James,</hi> and <hi>Sallome,</hi> having bought Spices, and going to Embalm the Body, ſaid who will roll away the Stone for us. Secondly, When they come they found that the Stone was rolled away; for an Angel had done it, and with his appearing and Earthquake affrighted away the Soldiers. Thirdly, That Angel with another ſaith to the Women fear not, I know you ſeek Jeſus that was was Crucified: why ſeek ye the living among the dead; he is not here, he is Riſen, Come, ſee the place, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 4. Then the Women run and tell the Diſciples, They have taken away the Lord we know not where they have laid him. 5. Then <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> run to ſee: 6. <hi>Mary</hi> being come back ſtood weeping at the Enterance and looked back and ſaw two Angels, as <hi>John</hi> reciteth it. 7. Then <hi>Mary</hi> looked back and ſaw Chriſt, and at firſt knew him not, and he ſpake to her as here. 8. Then ſhe runs and tells the Diſciples, that ſhe had ſeen the Lord: 9. Either then or when ſhe was gone Jeſus met the reſt of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and ſaid to them All hail, and they laid hold on his Feet and worſhipped him; and he ſaid fear not, Go tell my brethen &amp;c.</p>
               <p rend="small">Or perhaps we may make it ſhorter. As, 1. The Stone rolled away and the keeper affrighted away. 2. <hi>Mary</hi> and the other women comes and find it ſo. 3.

The women Staying ſee firſt one Angel on the Stone on the right ſide and then two, one at the head and one at the feet of the place. 7. Theſe Angels ſay all that is mentioned, to <hi>Mary</hi> and the reſt. 8. <hi>Mary</hi> ſeeth Jeſus and ſo do the reſt, who holding him by the feet he reſtraineth further corporal contract, and ſpeaketh to <hi>Mary</hi> and the reſt all that is mentioned. 9. Then ſhe and they tell the Diſciples that they had ſeen him, and what he ſaid. This ſeemeth the order of all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
               <p n="18">18. Mary Magdalene came and told the Diſciples, that ſhe had ſeen the Lord, and that he had ſpoken theſe things unto her. 19. Then the ſame day at evening, being the firſt day of the week, when the doors were ſhut, where the Diſciples were aſſembled for fear of the Jews, came Jeſus and ſtood in the midſt, and ſaith unto them, Peace be unto you.</p>

And if any man have not the Spirit of Chriſt, he is none of his, by what name or Title ſoever he be dignified.</p>

But he ſaid unto them, Except I ſhall ſee in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thruſt my hand into his ſide, I will not believe.</p>
               <p rend="small">24. <hi>Note,</hi> All Chriſts Diſciples were not equally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to believe. 2. This obſtinate Reſolution de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved a deſertion yet Chriſt in mercy overcame it and forſook him not.</p>
               <p n="26">26. And after eight days, again his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples were within, and Thomas with them: then came Jeſus, the doors being ſhut, and ſtood in the midſt, and ſaid, Peace be unto you.</p>
               <p rend="small">26. The next firſt day of that week, they being aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled, <hi>&amp;c.

               <p n="27">27. Then ſaith he to Thomas, Reach hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thy finger, and behold my hands; and reach hither thy hand, and thruſt it into my ſide: and be not faithleſs, but believing.</p>
               <p rend="small">27. <hi>Note,</hi> Wonderful is the Condeſcenſion of Chriſt to thoſe that he will ſave.</p>
               <p n="28">28. And Thomas anſwered and ſaid unto him, My Lord and my God.</p>
               <p rend="small">28. <hi>Note,</hi> The convincing condeſcenſion of Chriſt turns unbelief into a Rapture of adoration: Now <hi>Thomas</hi> cryeth My Lord and my God.</p>
               <p n="29">29. Jeſus ſaith unto him, Thomas, becauſe thou haſt ſeen me, thou haſt believed: bleſſed are they that have not ſeen, and yet have believed.</p>
               <p rend="small">29. I have condeſcended to thy ſight and feeling: But this ſhall be the common way to bleſſedneſs, but they that have not ſeen ſhall believe and ſo be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXI.</head>
               <p>AFter theſe things Jeſus ſhewed himſelf again to the Diſciples at the ſea of Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berias; and on this wiſe ſhewed he him ſelf: 2. There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the ſons of Zebedee, and two other of his Diſciples. 3. Simon Peter ſaith unto them, I go a fiſhing. They ſay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, We alſo go with thee. They went forth, and entred into a ſhip immediately; and that night they caught nothing.</p>
               <p rend="small">1, 2, 3. <hi>Note,</hi> The Diſciples went home to their Trades when Jeſus was Crucified: 2. Their unſuceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs was to prepare for the Miracle.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But when the morning was now come, Jeſus ſtood on the ſhore: but the Diſciples knew not that it was Jeſus.</p>
               <p rend="small">4. His appearance after his Reſurrection was with ſome change from what he appeared before.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Then Jeſus ſaith unto them Children, have ye any meat? They anſwered him No. 6. And he ſaid unto them, Caſt the net on the right ſide of the ſhip and ye ſhall find. They caſt therefore, and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fiſhes.</p>
               <p rend="small">5, 6. Chriſt taketh occaſion of their fruſtration to ſhew his Power and help their Faith.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Therefore that Diſciple whom Jeſus loved, ſaith unto Peter, It is the Lord. Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt his fiſhers coat unto him (for he was naked) and did caſt himſelf into the ſea.</p>
               <p rend="small">7. When the Miracle convinced him upon <hi>Johns</hi> words that it was the Lord, he put on his Fiſhers Coat and leapt into the Sea, to ſhew that he truſted Chriſt with his Life.</p>
               <p n="8">8. And the other Diſciples came in a little ſhip (for they were not far from land, but as it were two hundred cubits) dragging the net with fiſhes. 9. As ſoon then as they were come to land, they ſaw a fire of coals there, and fiſh laid thereon, and bread. 10. Jeſus ſaith unto them, Bring of the fiſh which ye have now caught. 11. Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land, full of great fiſhes, an hundred and fifty and three: and for all there were ſo many, yet was not the net bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</p>
               <p rend="small">8. Here are two Miracles conjoyned: The Fiſh catcht, and the Fiſh and Bread &amp; Fire prepared for them.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Jeſus ſaith unto them, Come and dine, And none of the Diſciples durſt ask him: Who art thou? knowing that it was the Lord. 13. Jeſus then cometh, and taketh bread, and giveth them, and fiſh likewiſe.</p>
               <p rend="small">12, 13. They knew him more by the Miracle than by his Viſage. Though it be not ſaid tha the did Eat and Drink with them; it is not improbable though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain.</p>
               <p n="14">14. This is now the third time that Jeſus ſheweth himſelf to his Diſciples, after that he was riſen from the dead.</p>
               <p rend="small">14. This was the third time that he appeared to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them together, or the third that <hi>John</hi> Recordeth, and the third day of his appearing, though the ſixth appearance made: And whether that on a Mountain in <hi>Gallilee,</hi> mentioned by others was at this time is doubted.</p>
               <p n="15">15. So when they had dined, Jeſus ſaith to Simon Peter, Simon Son of Jonas, loveſt thou me more then theſe? He ſaith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knoweſt that I love thee. He ſaith unto him, Feed my Lambs.</p>
               <p rend="small">15. Thou didſt lately profeſs that if all men forſook me, yet thou wouldſt not, as if thou hadſt loved me more than all the reſt. And yet did three times deny me: Art thou now of the ſame Reſolution more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed — If thou be, what Love thou haſt to me, ſhew it by thy Miniſterial Love and Labour, for the Souls even of the loweſt.</p>
               <p n="16">16. He ſaith to him again the ſecond time, Simon ſon of Jonas, loveſt thou me? He ſaith unto him, yea Lord; thou knoweſt that I love thee. He ſaith unto him, Feed my ſheep.</p>
               <p rend="small">16. Thou knoweſt the heart and therefore knoweſt that I love thee, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="17">17. He ſaith unto him the third time, Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſon of Jonas, loveſt thou me? Peter was grieved, becauſe he ſaid unto him the third time, Loveſt thou me? And he ſaid unto him, Lord, thou knoweſt all things; thou knoweſt that I love thee. Jeſus ſaith unto him, Feed my ſheep.</p>
               <p rend="small">17. <hi>N. Peters</hi> threefold denyal required a threefold Confeſſion, and engagement to future fidelity and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; and this told him what Diſcipline he was to uſe by the power of Church Government towards others

that ſo offend. 2. Miniſters that are to require Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion and Promiſes of obedience to Chriſt from of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders in order to their Reſtoration, muſt lead the way in the ſame themſelves if they ſcandalouſly ſin. 3. The great evidence of our Love to Chriſt muſt be in ſerving the Church and Souls.</p>
               <p n="18">18. Verily, verily I ſay unto thee, When thou waſt young, thou girdeſt thy ſelf, and walkedſt whither thou wouldeſt: but when thou ſhalt be old, thou ſhalt ſtretch forth thy hands, and another ſhall gird thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldeſt not.</p>
               <p rend="small">18, 19. Thou waſt at thy free diſpoſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But here, after others ſhall bind thee, and carry thee to Priſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thy will, and alſo unto death. By theſe words he ſignified that he ſhould be Martyred.</p>
               <p n="19">19. This ſpake he, ſignifying by what death he ſhould glorifie God. And when he had ſpoken this, he ſaith unto him, Follow me.</p>
               <p rend="small">19. Follow me in labour and fufferings unto Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
               <p n="20">20. Then Peter turning about, ſeeth the Diſciple whom Jeſus loved, following; which alſo leaned on his breaſt at ſupper, and ſaid, Lord which is he that betrayeth thee? 21. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſeeing him, ſaith to Jeſus, Lord, and what ſhall this man do?</p>
               <p rend="small">20. What ſhall become of <hi>John.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="22">22. Jeſus ſaith unto him, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? Follow thou me.</p>
               <p rend="small">22. What is that to thee how long he ſhall live, if it were till my coming; or if he live till he ſee my Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholik Church ſetled under my proper Government, when the Jews Law and Policy are fully diſſolved at the deſtruction of their Temple and Nation.</p>
               <p n="23">23. Then went this ſaying abroad among the brethren that that Diſciple ſhould not die: yet Jeſus ſaid not unto him, He ſhall not die: but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee?</p>
               <p rend="small">23. <hi>Note,</hi> A falſe Tradition may paſs amongſt Chriſts own Diſciples by miſunderſtanding in ſome things.</p>
               <p n="24">24. This is the Diſciple which teſtifieth of theſe things, and wrote theſe things: and we know that his teſtimony is true.</p>
               <p rend="small">24. This is <hi>John</hi> the Diſciple who was an Eye and Ear witneſs of all this, and who wrote this Hiſtory of Chriſt; And whoſe teſtimony the Church doth juſtly receive as true.</p>
               <p rend="small">
                  <hi>Note,</hi> Though ſome take theſe words to be the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of <hi>Aſia</hi> that publiſhed <hi>Johns</hi> Goſpel, (at whoſe requeſt they ſay he wrote it about thirty two years after Chriſts Reſurrection,) yet it is no leſs probable that the words are his own, and that [we know] ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth only [its well known to the Churches.</p>
               <p n="25">25. And there are alſo many other things which Jeſus did, the which if they ſhould be written every one, I ſuppoſe that even the world it ſelf could not contain the books that ſhould be written. Amen.</p>
               <p rend="small">25. Though this Hiſtory be written to Record divers things which others have omitted, yet altogether are far from containing all the Miracles that Chriſt did: which were ſo many that ſhould they all be written, the many and great Volumns would as it were overload the World.</p>
               <p rend="small">
                  <hi>Note,</hi> 1. That therefore it is not to be matter of offence, if any one Evangeliſt paſs by divers particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
               <p rend="small">2. That though multitudes of Chriſts Words and Miracles may be unknown to us, as much is Recorded as he would have taken as needful to the notice of the Church through all Generations: And none of his Laws or Promiſes the objects of our Obedience and Faith are omitted: yea all that is eſſential to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity is contained in Baptiſm or a very narrow room.</p>
               <p rend="small">3. It is in vain to pretend Oral Tradition for any needful thing omitted in the Scripture Records, though the Eſſentials and greateſt practical Matters of Religion are moſt certainly delivered us both ways, even by the Scriptures, and by the Univerſal publick practice of the Churches.</p>

               <p n="9">9. And all the people ſaw him walking and praiſing God. 10. And they knew that it was he which ſat for alms at the Beautiful gate of the Temple: and they were filled with wonder and amazment at that which had happened unto him.</p>

               <p n="11">11. And as the lame man which was healed, held Peter and John, all the People ran together unto them in the Porch that is called Solomons, greatly wondring.</p>

               <p rend="small">12. After all the Miracles that Chriſt himſelf did, why make you ſo ſtrange a matter of this: or why gaze you with wonder on us, as if you, thought we did it by our own Power or Holineſs.</p>

But ye denied the holy one, and the juſt, and deſired a murderer to be granted unto you, 15. And killed the Prince of life, whom God hath raiſed from the dead: whereof we are witneſſes.</p>
               <p rend="small">13. This is the work of Jeſus glorified, whom ye Murdered, though he was the Holy One and Juſt, and the Lord of Life, now raiſed to Glory.</p>
               <p n="16">16. And his name through faith in his name hath made this man ſtrong, whom ye ſee and know: yea, the faith which is by him, hath given him this perfect ſoundneſs in the preſence of you all.</p>

His parents anſwered them, and ſaid, We know that this is our ſon, and that he was born blind: 21. But by what means he now ſeeth, we know not, or who hath opened his eyes, we know not: he is of age, ask him, he ſhall ſpeak for himſelf. 22.

               <p n="32">32. Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind. 33. If this man were not of God, he could do nothing.</p>

And at that time there was a great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution againſt the Church which was at Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, and they were all ſcattered abroad throughout the Regions of Judea and Samaria, except the Apoſtles.</p>
               <p rend="small">1. Note, <hi>Sauls</hi> Perſecution muſt be recorded before his Converſion. 2. The pureſt Church was not free from the malice of wicked men. 3. God uſed Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant Perſecutions for the ſpreading abroad his word.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And devout men carried Stephen to his burial, and made great lamentation over him.</p>
               <p rend="small">2. They made a Funeral for <hi>Stephen</hi> with ſolemn mourning.</p>
               <p n="3">3. As for Saul, he made havock of the Church, entring into every Houſe, and hail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men and women, committed them to priſon.</p>
               <p rend="small">3. By halling people to Priſons out of their houſes, <hi>Saul</hi> waſted the gathered Church.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Therefore they that were ſcattered abroad, went every where Preaching the word.</p>
               <p rend="small">4. <hi>Note,</hi> It was a tolerable hurt to their bodies, which brought good to others Souls, and ſo enlarged the Church by ſcattering it, as ſeed is ſcattered that is ſown. 2. All Chriſtians may and muſt publiſh the Goſpel where they come if there be need, tho only called Miniſters muſt make an office and calling of it, as ſeparated to it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and Preached Chriſt unto them.</p>
               <p rend="small">5. <hi>Philip</hi> the Deacon Preacht at the City of <hi>Samaria,</hi> after by <hi>Herod</hi> called <hi>Sebaſte.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. And the People with one accord gave heed unto thoſe things which Philip ſpake hearing and ſeeing the miracles which he did, 7. For unclean Spirits crying with loud voice, came out of many that were poſſeſſed with them: and many taken with palſies, and that were lame were healed. 8. And there was great joy in that City.</p>
               <p rend="small">6. The <hi>Samaritans</hi> received the Goſpel with great joy, convinced by Miracles, and pleaſed by many Cures.</p>
               <p rend="small">
                  <hi>Note,</hi> The Goſpel where ever it cometh is cauſe of great joy.</p>
               <p n="9">9. But there was a certain man called Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, which before time in the ſame city uſed ſorcery, and bewitched the People of Samaria, giving out, that himſelf was ſome great one. 10. To whom they all gave heed from the leaſt to the greateſt, ſaying, This man is the great power of God. 11. And to him they had regard, becauſe that of long time he had bewitched them with Sorceries.</p>
               <p rend="small">9. One <hi>Simon</hi> had long been reputed among them ſome great man, even the great power of God, as he boaſted of himſelf; becauſe by Sorcery he had long bewitched, and done ſome ſtrange things among them: And they all admired and regarded him.</p>
               <p rend="small">
                  <hi>Note,</hi> Deceivers have uſually many followers.</p>
               <p n="12">12. But when they believed Philip, preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God, and the Name of Jeſus Chriſt, they were baptized, both men and women.</p>
               <p rend="small">
                  <pb facs="tcp:66325:121"/>12. <hi>Note,</hi> This ſuddain Baptizing yet implyeth time for inſtruction, and profeſſion of all eſſential to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Then Simon himſelf believed alſo: and when he was baptized, he continued with Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip, and wondered, beholding the miracles and ſigns which were done.</p>
               <p rend="small">13. <hi>Simon</hi> ſaw the reality of <hi>Philips</hi> Miracles, being conſcious of the fallacy of his own, and he believed that Jeſus was the Chriſt and was baptized into his name, and ſtayed with <hi>Phillip</hi> admiring his works.</p>
               <p rend="small">
                  <hi>Note,</hi> 1. <hi>Simon</hi> had a Superficial opinionative be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, that was not clear and ſound, nor effectual to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new his Soul. 2. The Miniſters of Chriſt baptized not as <hi>Heart ſearchers,</hi> as knowing mens ſincerity, but as taking their Profeſſion for their title to Baptiſm.</p>
               <p n="14">14. Now when the Apoſtles which were at Jeruſalem, heard that Samaria had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the word of God, they ſent unto them Peter and John:</p>
               <p rend="small">14. <hi>Note,</hi> As <hi>Peter</hi> or <hi>John</hi> were no Rulers of the reſt of the Apoſtles, ſo the reſt ſent not them as Rulers of them by Vote, but by brotherly requeſt and conſent.</p>
               <p n="15">15. Who when they were come down, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for them that they might receive the holy Ghoſt. 16. (For as yet he was fallen upon none of them: only they were baptized in the Name of the Lord Jeſus.) 17. Then laid they their hands on them, and they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p rend="small">15. <hi>Note</hi> 1. It was at firſt the eminent Priviledge of the Apoſtles that the Holy Ghoſt ſhould be given by their Miniſtry: 2. Impoſition of hands being an uſual act of Authoritative benediction was uſed as the ſign herein. 3. Yet Prayer to God muſt firſt prevail for his grant thereof, before the Sign was uſed. 4. This gift of the Holy Ghoſt was not that which is Regenerating and neceſſary to pardon and Salvation (elſe all theſe Baptiſed perſons muſt be ſuppoſed till ſo long after unpardoned;) but it was that extraordinary gift which was for the firſt ſealing and propagating the Goſpel, of which others could be diſcerning Judges, (ſuch as Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages Prophecy Healing, Miracles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>); which they were not of ſincere inward holineſs.</p>
               <p n="18">18. And when Simon ſaw that through laying on of the Apoſtles hands, the holy Ghoſt was given, he offered them mony, 19. Saying, Give me alſo this power, that on whomſoever I lay hands, he may receive the holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p rend="small">18. <hi>Note</hi> 1. It was ſuch a thing as <hi>Simon</hi> could ſee in the preſent effects: 2. He deſired this power in pride for his own advancement, and not for Chriſt and Souls. 3. He overvalued Money, and blaſphemouſly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ilified God, as if he ſet his gifts to ſale.</p>
               <p n="20">20. But Peter ſaid unto him, Thy money periſh with thee, becauſe thou haſt thought that the gift of God may be purchaſed with Money.</p>
               <p rend="small">20. Unleſs thou Repent thou ſhalt periſh with thy Money, for this blaſphemous thought of God.</p>
               <p n="21">21. Thou haſt neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is not right in the ſight of God.</p>
               <p rend="small">21. Though thou art Baptized, thou art no true Chriſtian, nor haſt any part in the Grace and Spirit of Chriſt: for thy heart is unſound and falſe in the ſight of God.</p>
               <p n="22">22. Repent therefore of this thy wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and pray God, if perhaps the thoughts of thine heart may be forgiven thee. 23. For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterneſs, and in the bond of iniquity.</p>
               <p rend="small">22. Preſently Repent therefore of that wicked heart and blaſphemous thought; and pray to God for Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and forgiveneſs, while its poſſible to be obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p rend="small">
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> Is not the Prayer of the Wicked abominable? <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes, the wicked Prayer of the Wicked; which is to ſerve his wickedneſs: And his beſt Prayers are not qualified for any certain grant: But if he truly <hi>Repent</hi> he is no longer wicked: And the Prayer a Common Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance (like <hi>Ahabs</hi> and the <hi>Ninevites</hi>) may tend to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards better, and is better than none. <hi>Queſt.</hi> Doth <hi>Peter</hi> mean that <hi>Simons</hi> heart was falſe at his Baptiſm, or that he received Grace and pardon then, and loſt it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by Apoſtacy. <hi>Anſw. Simons</hi> ſin made <hi>Peter</hi> newly perceive that his heart was falſe before, though his body was waſhed; but not that it now began to be falſe by a ſudden Apoſtacy? 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21, 22. He was in the Gall of bitterneſs and bond of Iniquity through the wickedneſs of his unſanctified heart, even when he was Baptized. Yet all this Hypocriſie and Wickedneſs was pardonable upon Repentance.</p>
               <p n="24">24. Then anſwered Simon, and ſaid, Pray ye to the Lord for me, that none of theſe things which ye have ſpoken come upon me.</p>
               <p rend="small">24. <hi>Note,</hi> His ſight of their Miracles and fear of deſtruction humbled him ſo far as to beg their Prayers that the threatned Judgments might not befall him. But whether the report of ſome old Writers be true, that after all this he pretended to be God the Father, and had a conflict with <hi>Peter,</hi> and flying in the Air fell down and was deſtroyed by his Prayers, and had a Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue at <hi>Rome</hi> inſcribed, <hi>Simoni Deo Sancto,</hi> &amp;c. of this many doubt, though others believe it: And if it was he that <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. and <hi>John</hi> in the <hi>Revelation</hi> ſpeak of as the <hi>Man of Sin,</hi> &amp;c. and the head of Hereſies ſo much decryed by <hi>Paul</hi> (as Doctour <hi>Hammond</hi> thinks) it is ſtrange that neither <hi>Luke,</hi> nor <hi>Paul,</hi> nor <hi>Peter,</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:66325:122"/>
nor <hi>Jude,</hi> nor <hi>James,</hi> nor <hi>John,</hi> who all inveigh againſt Hereſies would never once name him, when <hi>Nicolai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans, Diotrephes, Hymenaus, Phile<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="25">25. And they when they had teſtified and Preached the word of the Lord, returned to Jeruſalem, and Preached the Goſpel in many villages of the Samaritanes. 26. And the Angel of the Lord ſpake unto Philip, ſaying, Ariſe and go towards the ſouth, unto the way that goeth down from Jeruſalem unto Gaza, which is deſert. 27. And he aroſe and went: and behold, a man of Ethiopia, an Eunuch of great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who had the charge of all her trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and had come to Jeruſalem for to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. 28. Was returning, and ſitting in his chariot, read Eſaias the Prophet.</p>
               <p rend="small">25, 26, <hi>&amp;c. Note,</hi> God ſhewed a notable proof in this of his free Electing Crace.</p>
               <p rend="small">2. Angels Miniſter towards the Converſion of Gods Elect.</p>
               <p rend="small">3. He that was a Proſelyte before and came ſo far to worſhip, was better prepared for the Goſpel than Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens.</p>
               <p rend="small">4. He that would loſe no time, but was reading Gods word on his Journey in his Chariot, was in Gods way for further Mercy, which was ſent after him.</p>
               <p n="29">29. Then the Spirit ſaid unto Philip, Go near, and joyn thy ſelf to this chariot.</p>
               <p rend="small">29. By inſpiration.] <hi>Note,</hi> the Chariot was driven ſlowly that he might read and ſo <hi>Phillip</hi> on foot could accompany it. Gods Spirit directeth his word to the Elect.</p>
               <p n="30">30. And Philip ran thither to him, and heard him read the Prophet Eſaias, and ſaid, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandeſt thou what thou readeſt? 31. And he ſaid, How can I, except ſome man ſhould guide me? and he deſired Philip that he would come up, and ſit with him.</p>
               <p rend="small">30. <hi>Note,</hi> God directed him to the Text: And God gave him the ſenſe of his own ignorance and inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency to underſtand, and of his need of a Teacher. And God gave him an humble mind, to condeſcend to ask a ſtranger on foot, to come ſit with him in his Chariot and teach him. All theſe were happy preparatives to Chriſtianity, and further Grace.</p>
               <p n="32">32. The place of the ſcripture which he read, was this, He was led as a ſheep to the ſlaughter, and like a Lamb dumb before his ſhearer, ſo opened he not his mouth: 33. In his humiliation his judgment was taken away: and who ſhall declare his generation? for his life is taken from the Earth.</p>
               <p rend="small">32. He ſuffered innocently and patiently by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous Cruel men; He humbled himſelf to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go their unjuſt judgment: They wickedly triumph over him, as cutting off his life from the Earth.</p>
               <p n="34">34. And the eunuch anſwered Philip, and ſaid, I pray thee, of whom ſpeaketh the Prophet this? of himſelf, or of ſome other man? 35. Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the ſame Scripture, and Preached unto him Jeſus. 36. And as they went on their way, they came unto a certain water: and the eunuch ſaid, See, here is water; what doth hinder me to be baptized?</p>
               <p rend="small">34, 35. <hi>Note,</hi> 1. He firſt craveth inſtruction and then Baptiſm, and is not forced to be Baptiſed againſt his will.</p>
               <p n="37">37. And Philip ſaid, If thou believeſt with all thine heart, thou mayeſt. And he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered and ſaid, I believe that Jeſus Chriſt is the Son of God.</p>
               <p rend="small">37. If thou believe with a ſerious well grounded re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved Faith, thou mayſt be Baptized and have the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent remiſſion of ſin as a Chriſtian.</p>
               <p rend="small">
                  <hi>Note,</hi> The belief that Jeſus is the Son of God inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth all the reſt that is neceſſary to Salvation, that is, That there is a God whom we offended to whom he reconcileth us, and who gave him to us in love, and that his word is true, and that by the Word and by the Holy Ghoſt he ſanctifieth and prepareth us for Heaven.</p>
               <p n="38">38. And he commanded the chariot to ſtand ſtill: and they went down both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him. 39. And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch ſaw him no more: and he went on his way rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing.</p>
               <p rend="small">38, 39. The Angel or Power of God caught away <hi>Phillip.</hi>

                  <hi>Note,</hi> A Converted man hath great cauſe of rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing. The Goſpel proclaimed, much more heartily received, is matter of great joy. 2. The Tradition of <hi>Abaſſia</hi> (where is a great Empire of Chriſtians) is that they received the Chriſtian Faith by this man who was the Queens Lord Treaſurer. And ſome Learned men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture that it was rather by <hi>Frumentius</hi> and <hi>Edeſius,</hi> and that it was <hi>Abaſſia</hi> that was by Hiſtorians miſcalled <hi>India</hi>: But if theſe firſt brought in Church Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by a Biſhop, the Eunuch might bring Lay Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity before.</p>
               <p n="40">40. But Philip was found at Azotus: and paſſing through, he preached in all the cities, till he came to Ceſarea.</p>

               <p>ANd Saul yet breathing out threatnings and ſlaughter againſt the Diſciples of the Lord, went unto the high Prieſt, 2. And deſired of him Letters to Damaſcus to the ſyna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues, that if he found any of this way, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were men or women, he might bring them bound unto Jeruſalem.</p>
               <p rend="small">1. Ignorant zeal made <hi>Saul</hi> ſet himſelf to deſtroy the Chrſtians, and ſought to the High Prieſt for Power, and travelled toward <hi>Damaſcus</hi> to do it: that he might find them out and bring them in Bonds.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And as he journeyed he came near Damaſcus: and ſuddenly there ſhined round about him a light from Heaven.</p>
               <p rend="small">3. God the father of Light; uſeth to ſhew himſelf to man by Light, external and internal, and ſo doe his Angels when the Devil is the Prince of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And he fell to the Earth, and heard a voice ſaying unto him, Saul, Saul, why perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuteſt thou me?</p>
               <p rend="small">4. The Power of God went forth with that Light, and caſt him to the ground, <hi>&amp;c. Note</hi> 1. Love and Mercy in Chriſt expoſtulate with a blinded furious Sinner, in order to his Converſion. 2. But till Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er had caſt him down the Expoſtulation came not: God can ſoon lay proud Proſecutors on the Earth, and tame them and make them fear and hear. 3. Whatever is done againſt Chriſtians for any thing that Chriſt commandeth them, he taketh as done againſt himſelf. If we are bound by the Law of Chriſt to Preach, to Pray, to edifie each other, to live a Holy life, and we be reviled, ſcorned, called all manner of evil names, impriſoned, fined, baniſhed, or murdered for this Chriſt will judge the doers of it as doing it againſt him.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And he ſaid, Who art thou, Lord, And the Lord ſaid, I am Jeſus whom thou perſecuteſt: It is hard for thee to kick againſt the pricks.</p>
               <p rend="small">5. <hi>Note,</hi> Did wicked Proſecutors know Chriſt, it would reſtrain them from perſecution. (But the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Devil hath taught Hypocrite Chriſtians to proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute him as by his own Authority and Commiſſion, and in his own name, and for his Church (that is, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.) 2. Chriſts Servants ſhould no more doubt of their ſeaſonable vindication when perſecuted for their duty, than if Chriſt was pesonally perſecuted in their ſtead 3. O how terrible will it at laſt prove to Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, that they have kickt with their bare feet againſt the Pricks or Thorns of Gods diſpleaſure? Who hath hardened himſelf againſt him and hath proſpered? Or who hath Conquered the Almighty.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And he trembling and aſtoniſhed, ſaid, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? And the Lord ſaid unto him, Ariſe, and go into the city, and it ſhall be told thee what thou muſt do.</p>
               <p rend="small">6. <hi>Note,</hi> God can make the firerceſt Perſecutor tremble: And then O how they are changed, ready to do any thing that God will bid them, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they Perſecuted. And if the change be true, this will hold and come to practice. 2. O then what need have proud Perſecutors to be caſt down, and how great a mercy to them it may prove?</p>
               <p n="7">7. And the men which journeyed with him, ſtood ſpeechleſs, hearing a voice, but ſeeing no man.</p>
               <p rend="small">7. <hi>Note,</hi> In <hi>Act.</hi> 22.9. it is ſaid, they that were with him ſaw the Light and were afraid, but heard not the voice of him that ſpake.] The ſence of both is, they ſaw the Light and heard the ſound, which its like was a Thunder, or like it; but heard not the voice or words of Chriſt, which in that ſound were uttered to him, nor ſaw any ſimilitude of Chriſt. Though we have only <hi>Pauls</hi> witneſs of this, his after life of labour, ſuffering and Miracles proveth it to be true.</p>
               <p n="8">8. And Saul, aroſe from the Earth; and when his eyes were opened he ſaw no man: but they led him by the hand, and brought him into Damaſcus.</p>
               <p rend="small">8. This ſtroak of blindneſs, was to convince him of the blindneſs of his Perſecuting fury.</p>
               <p n="9">9. And he was three days without ſight, and neither did eat nor drink.</p>
               <p rend="small">9. <hi>Note,</hi> This was ſome conformity to Chriſts being three Days and Nights in the darkſom Grave.</p>
               <p n="10">10. And there was a certain Diſciple at Damaſcus, named Ananias, and to him ſaid the Lord in a viſion, Ananias. And he ſaid, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, I am here, Lord. 11. And the Lord ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, Ariſe, and go into the ſtreet which is called Straight, and inquire in the Houſe of Judas for one called Saul of Tarſus: for behold, he prayeth, 12. And hath ſeen in a viſion a man named Ananias, coming in, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his hand on him, that he might receive his ſight.</p>
               <p rend="small">10. <hi>Ananias</hi> was a Chriſtian appointed by God to this work on <hi>Saul.</hi> 2. Praying was (next to reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved obedience and ſubmiſſion) the firſt fruits of <hi>Sauls</hi> Converſion.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Then Ananias anſwered, Lord, I have

heard by many of this man, how much evil he hath done to thy Saints at Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem: 14. And here he hath authority from the chief Prieſts; to bind all that call on thy name.</p>
               <p rend="small">13. <hi>Note, Ananias</hi> objecteth what he had heard of <hi>Sauls,</hi> as rendring his converſion improbable.</p>
               <p n="15">15. But the Lord ſaid unto him, Go thy way: for he is a choſen veſſel unto me, to bear my name before the Gentiles, and Kings, and the Children of Iſrael. 16. For I will ſhew him how great things he muſt ſuffer for my names ſake.</p>

               <p n="17">17. And Ananias went his way and entred into the Houſe; and putting his hands on him, ſaid, Brother Saul, the Lord (even Jeſus that appeared unto thee in the way as thou cameſt) hath ſent me, that thou mighteſt receive thy ſight, and be filled with the holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p rend="small">17. God hath made known to me, what he did to thee by the way, and hath ſent me that thou mighteſt be reſtored to thy ſight and filled with the Holy Ghoſt, for gifts neceſſary to the Miniſtry.</p>
               <p n="18">18. And immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been ſcales; and he received ſight forthwith, and aroſe, and was baptiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>

               <p n="19">19. And when he had received meat, he was ſtrengthened. Then was Saul certain days with the Diſciples which were at Dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcus. 20. And ſtraightway he Preached Chriſt in the Synagogue, that he is the Son of God.</p>
               <p rend="small">19, 20, Being ſtrengthned with food, he converſed certain days with the Chriſtians at <hi>Damaſcus</hi> whom he purpoſed to have preſecuted, and forthwith Preached Chriſt in the Syoagogue to the <hi>Jews,</hi> that he is the Son of God, and conſequently all his Goſpel true.

               <p rend="small">21. The ſuddain change from being a deſtroying Perſecutor to be a Preacher made the People won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
               <p n="22">22. But Saul increaſed the more in ſtrength, and confounded the Jews which dwelt at Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſcus, proving that this is very Chriſt.</p>
               <p rend="small">22. Proving Jeſus to be the true Chriſt, inferreth all the reſt to be believed.</p>
               <p n="23">23. And after that many days were fulfilled, the Jews took Counſel to kill him:</p>
               <p rend="small">23. If one of the Leaders of the Perſecutors or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant wicked Men ſhould be Converted and perſuade his Companions to turn, they would but ſeek to kill him alſo, till God Convert them.</p>
               <p n="24">24. But their laying await was known of Saul: and they watched the Gates day and night to kill him. a5. Then the Diſciples took him by night, and let him down by the wall in a basket.</p>
               <p rend="small">24. <hi>Note,</hi> It is lawful to avoid the violence of bloody Perſecutors by ſecret flight.</p>
               <p n="26">26. And when Saul was come to Jeruſalem, he aſſayed to joyn himſelf to the Diſciples: but they were all afraid of him, and believed not that he was a Diſciple.</p>
               <p rend="small">26. <hi>Note,</hi> 1. Converſion will ſhew it ſelf by joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the Converted. 2. Known Perſecutors and wicked men are not too haſtily to be truſted, when they profeſs Converſion.</p>
               <p n="27">27. But Barnabas took him, and brought him to the Apoſtles, and declared unto them how he had ſeen the Lord in the way, and that he had ſpoken to him, and how he had Preached boldly at Damaſcus in the name of Jeſus. 28. And he was with them coming in, and going out at Jeruſalem.</p>
               <p rend="small">27, 28. This evidence was ſatisfactory and they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him to their conſtant Society of the Church,</p>
               <p n="29">29. And he ſpake boldly in the name of the Lord Jeſus, and diſputed againſt the Grecians: but they went about to ſlay him. 30. Which when the brethren knew, they brought him down to Ceſarea, and ſent him forth to Tarſus.</p>
               <p rend="small">29, 30. He Preeached Chriſt boldly and confuted the unbelieving <hi>Jews</hi> that uſed the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue. But they ſought to kill him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="31">31. Then had the Churches reſt throughout all Judea, and Galilee, and Samaria, and were edified, and walking in the fear of the Lord, and in the comfort of the holy Ghoſt, were multiplied.</p>

                  <pb facs="tcp:66325:123"/>31. <hi>Saul</hi> being Converted who was a chief Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and he being removed whom they afterward moſt maligned, the Chriſtian Churches were quiet a while from Perſecution, and were edified in knowledge, and Holineſs of Heart and life, living in obedience to God, and in the Comfort of the inward Grace and outward Gifts and Miracles of the Holy Ghoſt, by which they were multiplyed.</p>
               <p n="32">32. And it came to paſs, as Peter paſſed throughout all quarters, he came down alſo to the ſaints which dwelt at Lydda.</p>

               <p n="33">33. And there he found a certain man named Eneas, which had kept his bed eight years, and was ſick of the palſie. 34. And Peter ſaid unto him, Eneas, Jeſus Chriſt mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth thee whole: ariſe, and make thy bed. And he aroſe immediately.</p>
               <p rend="small">33. <hi>Note,</hi> The length and nature of the Diſeaſe made the Miracle the more notable and convincing.</p>
               <p n="35">35. And all that dwelt at Lydda, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron, ſaw him, and turned to the Lord.</p>
               <p rend="small">35. The undenyable Miracle cauſed a general Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction and Converſion of them.</p>
               <p n="36">36. Now there was at Joppa a certain Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple named Tabitha, which by interpretation is called Dorcas: this woman was full of good works, and alms-deeds which ſhe did: 37. And it came to paſs in thoſe days, that ſhe was ſick, and died: whom when they had waſhed, they laid her in an upper Chamber. 38. And foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as Lydda was nigh to Joppa, and the Diſciples had heard that Peter was there, they ſent unto him two men, deſiring him that he would not delay to come to them.</p>
               <p rend="small">36. A laborious Charitable woman being dead, the Chriſtians had Faith to believe that by <hi>Peters</hi> Miniſtry ſhe might be raiſed to life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="39">39. Then Peter aroſe, and went with them. When he was come, they brought him into the upper Chamber: and all the widows ſtood by him weeping, and ſhewing the coats and garments which Dorcas made while ſhe was with them.</p>
               <p rend="small">39. <hi>Note,</hi> Its like they were poor-Widows, that ſhewed the fruit of her Labour and Charity to them and others.</p>
               <p n="40">40. But Peter put them all forth, and kneeled down and prayed, and turning him to the body, ſaid, Tabitha<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ariſe. And ſhe opened her eyes: and when ſhe ſaw Peter ſhe ſat up. 41. And he gave her his hand, and lift her up; and when he had called the ſaints and widows<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> preſented her alive.</p>
               <p rend="small">40. <hi>Note,</hi> This was not a Miracle to be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fervent Prayer: And it is like <hi>Peter</hi> had aſſurance of raiſing her as an anſwer to his Prayer, before he ſaid Ariſe.</p>
               <p n="42">42. And it was known throughout all Joppa; and many believed in the Lord.</p>
               <p rend="small">42. Thus Miracles made Chriſtians, and fully ſealed the Teſtimony of the Apoſtles.</p>

               <p n="5">5. And now ſend men to Joppa, and call for one Simon, whoſe ſurname is Peter: 6. He lodgeth with one Simon a tanner, whoſe houſe is by the ſea-ſide: he ſhall tell thee what thou oughteſt to do.</p>

               <p n="9">9. On the morrow as they went on their journey, and drew nigh unto the city, Peter went up upon the houſe-top to pray, about the ſixth hour.</p>

               <p n="10">10. And he became very hungry, and would have eaten: but while they made ready, he fell into trance, 11. And ſaw Heaven opened, and a certain veſſel deſcending unto him, as it had been a great ſheet knit at the four corners, and let down to the Earth: 12. Wherein were all manner of four-footed beaſts, of the Earth, and wild beaſts, and creep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things, and fowls of the air. 13.

And they ſaid, Cornelius the centurion, a juſt man, and one that feareth God, and of good report among all the nation of the Jews, was warned from God by an holy Angel to ſend for thee into his houſe, and to hear words of thee.</p>
               <p rend="small">22. God commanded <hi>Cornelius</hi> to ſend for thee to hear thee.</p>

And the morrow after they entred into Ceſarea: and Cornelius waited for them, and had called together his kniſmen and near friends.</p>

And he ſaid unto them, Ye know how that it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew, to keep company, or come unto one of another nation: but God hath ſhewed me, that I ſhould not call any man common or unclean. 29. Therefore came I unto you without gainſaying, aſſoon as I was ſent for: I ask therefore for what intent ye have ſent for me?</p>

               <p rend="small">1, 2. <hi>Note,</hi> 1. Even in the pure Apoſtolical firſt Church there were wrangling contending Chriſtians. 2. Even that which ſhould have been their rejoycing was their matter of cenſorious contention. 3. Theſe weak ones charged ſin on the Apoſtle as if they had been wiſer and holier than he. 4.

               <p n="4">4. But Beter rehearſed the matter from the begining, and expounded it by order unto them, ſaying, 5. I was in the City of Joppa praying; and in a trance I ſaw a Viſion, A certain Veſſel deſcend, as it had been a great ſheet, let down from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by four corners; and it came even to me. 6. Upon the which when I had faſtened mine eyes, I conſidered, and ſaw four-footed beaſts of the Earth, and wild beaſts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air. 7. And I heard a voice ſaying unto me, Ariſe, Peter; ſlay, and eat. 8. But I ſaid, Not ſo, Lord: for nothing common or unclean hath at any time entred into my mouth. 9. But the voice anſwered me again from Heaven, What God hath cleanſed, that call not thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. 10. And this was done three times: and all were drawn up again into Heaven. 11. And behold, immediately there were three men already come unto the houſe where I was, ſent from Ceſarea unto me. 12. And the Spirit bade me go with them, nothing doubting. Moreover, theſe ſix brethren accompanied me, and and we entred into the mans houſe: 13. And he ſhewed us how he had ſeen an Angel in his houſe, which ſtood and ſaid unto him, Send men to Joppa, and call for Simon, whoſe ſurname is Peter: 14. Who ſhall tell thee words, whereby thou and all thy houſe ſhall be ſaved.</p>

So they being ſent forth by the holy Ghoſt, departed unto Seleucia; and from thence they ſailed to Cyprus. 5. And when they were at Salamis, they Preached the word of God in the Synagogues of the Jews: and they had alſo John to their miniſter.</p>
               <p rend="small">3. <hi>Note,</hi> This was not the firſt Authorizing of them to be Miniſters by Office; for they were called and Preacht before. But it was their Call or Miſſion to this Particular work<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to go abroad Preaching to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Nations. To be ſeparated to the Miniſtry is to be done but once: But to be appointed to this or that place, charge or flock, may be oft done, and that by Faſting, Prayer, and Impoſition of hands. 2. They began their Preaching uſually in the <hi>Jews</hi> Synagogues in all Countrys where there were ſuch where they came, they being Expectants of the Meſſiah.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And when they had gone through the iſle unto Paphos, they Found a certain ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerer, a falſe Prophet, a Jew, whoſe name was Barjeſus: 7. Which was with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty of the Country, Sergius Paulus, a prudent man; who called for Barnabas and Saul, and deſired to hear the word of God.</p>

               <p n="8">8. But Elymas the ſorcerer (for ſo is his name by interpretation) withſtood them, ſeeking to turn away the deputy from the faith.</p>

on him a miſt and a darkneſs; and he went about ſeeking ſome to lead him by the hand.</p>

               <p n="12">12. Then the deputy when he ſaw what was done, believed, being aſtoniſhed at the doctrine of the Lord.</p>
               <p rend="small">12.

               <p n="15">15. And after the reading of the law and the Prophets, the Rulers of the Synagogues ſent unto them, ſaying Ye men and brethren, if ye have any word of exhortation for the people, ſay on.</p>

               <p rend="small">1. Some Chriſtian <hi>Jews</hi> thought and taught, that Circumciſion and keeping the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Salvation, both to <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile</hi> Chriſtians.</p>
               <p rend="small">
                  <hi>Note,</hi> 1. The ſound Doctrine of Chriſtianity was quickly corrupted be erring Teachers. 2. The threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of damnation, and making error ſeem neceſſary to ſalvation, was uſed to affright timerous Chriſtians into falſe ways.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When therefore Paul and Barnabas had no ſmall diſſenſion and diſputation with them, they determined that Paul and Barnabas, and certain other of them, ſhould go up to Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem unto the Apoſtles and Elders about this queſtion.</p>
               <p rend="small">2. <hi>Note,</hi> To be Diſſenters and Diſputants againſt er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors and tyrannical impoſitions upon conſcience, is no fault but a great duty.</p>
               <p rend="small">2. Its but a groundleſs fiction of ſome that tell us that this was an appeal to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> becauſe it was the Metropolis of <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Antioch</hi>: As if Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litan Church Power had been then ſettled: When long after, when it was deviſed indeed, <hi>Antioch</hi> was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>: And its as vain a fiction that this was an appeal to a general Council; as if the Apoſtles and Elders at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> had been a general Council, when none of the Biſhops of the Gentile Churches were there, or called thither. It is notorius that it was an appeal to the Apoſtles (taking in the Elders) as thoſe that had the certaineſt notice of Chriſts mind, having converſed with him, and being entruſted to teach all Nations whatever he commanded them, and had the greateſt meaſure of the ſpirit; and alſo being <hi>Jews</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, were ſuch as the Judaizing Chriſtians had no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to ſuſpect or reject.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And being brought on their way by the Church, they paſſed through Phenice, and Samaria, declaring the converſion of the Gentiles: and they cauſed great joy unto all the brethren.</p>
               <p rend="small">3. <hi>Note,</hi> By the Church that brought them on, is neither meant a Dioceſs of Churches, nor the meer Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy; but the chief Men of the Congregation of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>och. 2. The Gentiles converſation was joyful news.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And when they were come to Jeruſalem, they were received of the Church, and of the Apoſtles and Elders, and they declared all things that God had done with them. 5. But there roſe up certain of the Sect of the Phariſees which believed, ſaying, That it was needful to circumciſe them, and to command them to keep the law of Moſes.</p>
               <p rend="small">4. They firſt told them of their ſucceſs on the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, and then of the Doctrine of theſe Chriſtians <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees.</hi>
               </p>
               <p rend="small">
                  <hi>Note,</hi> The error, as to the <hi>Jews,</hi> had a fair reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious pretence; for <hi>Moſes</hi> Law was Gods own Law, and delivered by Angels, and confirmed be miracles; and Chriſt had ſaid that he came not to deſtroy it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Therefore had not, Apoſtolick Teſtimony, and the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Holy Ghoſt by miracles, proved the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation, it would more hardly have been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved by good men, than the ſubſtitute Canons of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
<pb facs="tcp:66325:129"/>
that have no ſuch pretence. But the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were never under <hi>Moſes</hi> Law as ſuch.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And the Apoſtles and Elders came toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for to conſider of this matter.</p>
               <p rend="small">6. <hi>Note,</hi> Gods inſpiration made not conſultation needleſs to themſelves, or to convince Gainſayers.</p>
               <p n="7">7. And when there had been much diſput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Peter roſe up and ſaid unto them, Men and brethren, ye know how that a good while ago, God made choice among us, that the Gentiles by my mouth ſhould hear the word of the Goſpel, and believe. 8. And God which knoweth the hearts, bare them witneſs, giving them the holy Ghoſt, even as he did unto us: 9. And put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith.</p>
               <p rend="small">7. Thoſe of the Phariſees way that came with <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> were heard diſputing for their cauſe, and then <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Now therefore why tempt ye God, to put a yoak upon the neck of the Diſciples, which neither our Fathers nor we were able to bear?</p>
               <p rend="small">10. God never put this yoke on the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and we <hi>Jews</hi> have found it a heavy burden.</p>
               <p n="11">11. But we believe that through the Grace of the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Lord Jeſus Chriſt, we ſhall be ſaved even as they.</p>
               <p rend="small">11. And it is not by the works of <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, that we <hi>Jews</hi> are juſtified and ſaved, but in the ſame way that is common to the <hi>Gentiles</hi> with us, even by the Grace of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Then all the multitude kept ſilence, and gave audience to Barnabas and Paul, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring what miracles and wonders God had wrought among the Gentiles by them.</p>
               <p rend="small">12. The miracles and converſion of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> was Gods approving Teſtimony in the caſe.</p>
               <p n="13">13. And after they had held their peace, James anſwered, ſaying,</p>
               <p rend="small">13. <hi>Note,</hi> They were not like the proud Magiſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Talkers, ſo full of themſelves, that they have not patience to reſtrain their liſt of ſpeaking till another hath done, but ſtop and ſilence him by rude uncivil in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption, on pretence that he is too long.</p>
               <p>13, 14. Men and brethren, hearken un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me. 14. Simon hath declared how God at the firſt did viſit the Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name. 15. And to this agree the words of the Prophets; as it is written, 16. After this I will return, and will build again the tabernacle of David, which is fallen down: and I will build again the ruines thereof, and I will ſet it up: 17. That the reſidue of men might ſeek after the Lord, and all the Gentiles upon whom my name is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, ſaith the Lord, who doeth all theſe things.</p>
               <p rend="small">13, 14. <hi>Note,</hi> Some think <hi>James</hi> meaneth the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy of <hi>Simeon, Luke</hi> 2.32. A Light to lighten the <hi>Gentiles</hi>: but its liker, (though not certain) that its <hi>Peter</hi> here that he meaneth.</p>
               <p n="18">18. Known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the world.</p>
               <p rend="small">18. God that hath prophecyed of this calling of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> decreed and foreknew it. They are his works as well as we, and he is merciful to all.</p>
               <p n="19">19. Wherefore my ſentence is, that we trouble not them which from among the Gentiles are returned to God: 20. But that we write unto them, that they abſtain from pollutions of idols, and from fornication, and from things ſtrangled, and from bloud.</p>
               <p rend="small">19. <hi>Note,</hi> It is not agreed by expoſitors what theſe words mean, whether it be only things indifferent that are here determined (as <hi>Beza</hi> and ſome other think, and that only to avoid offence for a time: Or whether it be the precepts of <hi>Noah</hi> impoſed on the Proſelites of the Gate as ſuch, (as Doctor <hi>Hammond</hi> thought) They that go the firſt way, think, that by [<hi>Fornication</hi>] here is meant <hi>Idolatry,</hi> that is, the countenancing of it by the uſe of things in themſelves indifferent: But moſt think, that by [<hi>Fornication</hi>] is meant ſome controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſorts of it, as marrying within ſome prohibited de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, or uſing Concubines, or ſecond Wives, which the <hi>Jews</hi> ſcrupled not. And others think that the ignorance of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> of the evil of Fornication, and ſome Hereticks pleading for it, made it, though not indifferent joyned with the reſt.</p>
               <p rend="small">Thoſe that go the ſecond way, ſay, that to the <hi>Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> of the Gate, the ſeven precepts of <hi>Noah</hi> were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, and therefore, when they turned Chriſtians, not to be caſt off: And by [<hi>Blood</hi>] they think is meant [<hi>Bloodſhed</hi> or <hi>Murder</hi>:] ſo the two firſt precepts (ſaith Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi>) are, for worſhipping the true God: 2. And not Idols; both theſe are included in [<hi>Abſtaining</hi> from <hi>Meats</hi> offered to <hi>Idols.</hi>] 3. Abſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from <hi>Blood,</hi> is the fifth of thoſe precepts againſt Murder. 4. From things ſtrangled is the ſeventh. 5. From <hi>Fornication</hi> was the fourth. 6. And many an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Greek</hi> copies add here [<hi>Thou ſhalt not do to another what thou wouldſt not have done to thee</hi>] and that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth that againſt theft and injuſtice, &amp;c. Which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of theſe be right it maketh no difference as to our obligation. By <hi>eating</hi> things <hi>ſtrangled</hi> and <hi>blood,</hi> can be meant no more than ſuch beaſtly devouring, either
<pb facs="tcp:66325:130"/>
of the blood it ſelf, or the blood in the ſtrangled Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which ſignifyeth a bloody mind, and may harden men in cruelty, and eaſilyer diſpoſe them to ſhed Mans blood. And if there be any more that is ceremonious in it, it was temporary to avoid the <hi>Jews</hi> offence: But if any think any more to be unlawful, its lawful to forbear it.</p>
               <p n="21">21. For Moſes of old time hath in every city them that Preach him, being read in the Synagogues every ſabbath-day.</p>
               <p rend="small">21. As for the <hi>Jews,</hi> the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> belongs to them, and we leave them to it, till God ſhall diſſolve their State and Policy (it is preached by the reading of it in the Synagogues every Sabbath day.)</p>
               <p n="22">22. Then pleaſed it the Apoſtles and Elders, with the whole Church, to ſend choſen men of their own company of Antioch, with Paul and Barnabas; namely, Judas ſurnamed Barſabas, and Silas, chief men among the brethren.</p>
               <p rend="small">22. Though the Apoſtles were the infallible Deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, the Elders and the whole Church were unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Conſenters, and to ſhew the neceſſity of concord, and that even infallible and miraculous Teachers, yet guide only Volunteers; They ſent ſome of their own Company (of the College that guided the Church at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>; or as Doctor <hi>Hammond</hi> thinketh Biſhops of ſome ſingle Congregations in <hi>Judea</hi>) that contending parties might not be the only reporters of their ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.</p>
               <p n="23">23. And wrote Letters by them after this manner, The Apoſtles, and Elders, and bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren ſend greeting unto the brethren which are of the Gentiles in Antioch, and Syria, and and Cilicia. 24. Foraſmuch as we have heard that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words, ſubverting your ſouls, ſaying, ye muſt be circumciſed, and keep the law; to whom we gave no ſuch command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</p>
               <p rend="small">23, 24. <hi>Note,</hi> 1. If Falſe Teachers pretended Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolick Authority or miſſion when they were neer them, no wonder if they do it now when they are not ſo ehſily confutted. 2. Tyrannical impoſitions on Conſcience, do but trouble the Church and ſubvert Souls, by pious pretences.</p>
               <p n="25">25. It ſeemed good unto us, being aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with one accord, to ſend choſen men unto you, with our beloved Barnabas and Paul; 26. Men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. 27. We have ſent therefore Judas and Silas, who ſhall alſo tell you the ſame things by mouth.</p>
               <p rend="small">25. Thus far their Letters are Credential, to tell them that they may believe the Meſſengers.</p>
               <p n="28">28. For it ſeemed good to the holy Ghoſt, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden then theſe neceſſary things;</p>
               <p rend="small">28. <hi>Note,</hi> 1. It is prophaneneſs for any Biſhops or Councells to uſe theſe words, who neither have aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, nor can give any proof that the Holy Ghoſt gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth them. 2. The Holy Ghoſt is againſt impoſing unneceſſary things as neceſſary. Theſe things here im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed were neceſſary, at leaſt all to thoſe Perſons, and at the time, and moſt (if not all) continually.</p>
               <p n="29">29. That ye abſtain from meats offered to idols, and from bloud, and from things ſtrangled, and from fornication, from which if ye keep your ſelves, ye ſhall do well. Fare ye well.</p>
               <p rend="small">29. It is not <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law that ye are bound to keep, but theſe commoner precepts. Do nothing that ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly favoureth Idolatry, or ſavoreth of cruelty and bloodineſs, not eating ſtrangled Creatures in the gore blood, avoid defilement, by any ſort of forbidden fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly luſt and filthineſs.</p>
               <p n="30">30. So when they were diſmiſſed, they came to Antioch: and when they had gathered the multitude together, they delivered the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle</p>
               <p rend="small">30. <hi>Note,</hi> The Multitude was one Aſſembly, not a Dioceſs, nor only the Clergy.</p>
               <p n="31">31. Which when they had read, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced for the conſolation.</p>
               <p rend="small">31. <hi>Note,</hi> Liberty from toylſome Ceremonies (tho God firſt inſtituted them) was matter of joy to the Churches: But alaſs few Churches are allowed that joy, by their Lordly Paſtors.</p>
               <p n="32">32. And Judas and Silas being Prophets alſo themſelves, exhorted the brethren with many words, and confirmed them.</p>
               <p rend="small">32. <hi>Note,</hi> By [Prophets] is meant ſuch as were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ed by the Holy Ghoſt, either by Revelation of any new thing, or by ability to explain and apply known truth.</p>
               <p n="33">33. And after they had tarried there a ſpace, they were let go in peace from the brethren unto the Apoſtles. 34. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding it pleaſed Silas to abide there ſtill. 35. Paul alſo and Barnabas continued in Antioch, teaching and Preaching the word of the Lord, with many others alſo.</p>
               <p rend="small">33. <hi>Note,</hi> The Church of <hi>Antioch</hi> had many excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Teachers, and it is not intimated, that any one
<pb facs="tcp:66325:130"/>
was Biſhop over the reſt, or that <hi>Paul, Barnabas, Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las, Simeon, Lucius, Manaen,</hi> &amp;c. were ſubjects to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one.</p>
               <p n="36">36. And ſome days after, Paul ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Barnabas, Let us go again and viſit our brethren, in every city where we have Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the word of the Lord, and ſee how they do.</p>
               <p rend="small">36. <hi>Note,</hi> Converted Souls and Planted Churches, muſt be further viſited, obſerved and watered.</p>
               <p n="37">37. And Barnabas determined to take with them John whoſe ſurname was Mark. 38. But Paul thought not good to take him with them, who departed from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work. 39. And the contention was ſo ſharp bttween them, that they departed aſunder one from the other: and ſo Barnabas took Mark, and ſailed unto Cyprus; 40. And Paul choſe Silas, and departed, being recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by the brethren unto the Grace of God. 41. And he went through Syria, and Cilicia, confirming the Churches.</p>
               <p rend="small">37. <hi>Note,</hi> Apoſtles were not infallible in all things, even about the fitneſs of their Helpers. 2. Small dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences even to ſharpen contention, may ſtand with Chriſtian Love and Unity. 3. There was then no Judge of ſuch controverſies, either Biſhop or Synod to avoid and end them. 4. But God turned this to good, for the better ſpreading of the Goſpel.</p>

               <p>THen came he to Derbe and Lyſtra: and behold, a certain Diſciple was there, named Timotheus, the ſon of a certain woman, which was a Jeweſs, and believed; but his Father was a Greek. 2. Which was well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported of by the brethren that were at Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtra and Iconium. 3. Him would Paul have to go forth with him; and took and circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him, becauſe of the Jews which were in thoſe quarters: for they knew all that his Father was a Greek.</p>
               <p rend="small">1. <hi>Timothy</hi>'s Mother being a <hi>Jew,</hi> he might be cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed, though his Father was a <hi>Greek</hi>: And becauſe uncircumciſed, he might not be admitted to converſe with the <hi>Jews,</hi> he circumciſed him, the <hi>Jews</hi> being yet permitted to uſe the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi>: which he would not have done, had both Parents been <hi>Gentiles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. And as they went through the Cities, they delievered them the decrees for to keep, that were ordained of the Apoſtles and Elders which were at Jeruſalem. 5. And ſo were the Churches eſtabliſhed in the faith, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed in number daily.</p>
               <p rend="small">4, 5. They delivering them the Apoſtles Decrees; freed the Church from the doubts which the <hi>Judaizers</hi> had raiſed, and ſo they were quieted and ſetled in Judgment, Faith and Concord, and daily increaſed.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Now when they had gone through Phrygia, and the region of Galatia, and were forbidden of the holy Ghoſt to preach the word in Aſia,</p>
               <p rend="small">6. Forbidden by ſome Revelation or Inſpiration.</p>
               <p n="7">7. After they were come to Myſia, they aſſayed to go into Bithynia: but the Spirit ſuffered them not. 8. And they paſſing by Myſia, came down to Troas.</p>
               <p rend="small">7. The invitation or inſpiration of Gods Spirit di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted them.</p>
               <p n="9">9. And a viſion appeared to Paul in the night: There ſtood a man of Macedonia, and prayed him, ſaying, Come over into Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donia, and help us.</p>
               <p rend="small">9. <hi>Note,</hi> Gods differencing grace plainly appeareth in ſending his Goſpel to ſome Countries, rather than to other.</p>
               <p n="10">10. And after he had ſeen the viſion, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately we endeavoured to go into Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donia, aſſuredly gathering that the Lord had called us for to preach the Goſpel unto them.</p>
               <p rend="small">10. <hi>Note,</hi> It is the duty of Miniſters to follow Gods call; though all have not viſions, all have ſome notifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of Gods will, by Mens neceſſity, opportunity, invitation, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Therefore looſing from Troas, we came with a ſtraight courſe to Samothracia, and the next day to Neapolis; 12. And from thence to Philippi, which is the cheif city of that part of Macedonia, and a colony: and we were in that city abiding certain days.</p>
               <p rend="small">11. <hi>Note,</hi> The Apoſtles did chooſe Populous Cities to Preach in, becauſe there was moſt matter to work on: Its beſt fiſhing in the Sea. Beſides that, the <hi>Jews</hi> Synagogues were moſtly in ſuch places.</p>
               <p n="13">13. And on the ſabbath we went out of the city by a River-ſide, where prayer was wont to be made; and we ſat down, and ſpake unto the women which reſorted thither.</p>
               <p rend="small">
                  <pb facs="tcp:66325:131"/>13. <hi>Note,</hi> Whether here was an Oratory or Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or only the open Field, is uncertain: And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Aſſemblies were Proſelites of the <hi>Jews,</hi> or <hi>Jews</hi> with ſuch, or the better ſort of <hi>Gentiles,</hi> is not certain: But the firſt is likely, becauſe they kept the Sabbath.</p>
               <p n="14">14. And a certain woman named Lydia, a ſeller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, which worſhipped God, heard us: whoſe heart the Lord opened, that ſhe attended unto the things which were ſpoken of Paul.</p>
               <p rend="small">14. 1. <hi>Note,</hi> Its like ſhe was a Proſelite. 2. They that worſhip God are beſt prepared for further Grace: 3. Gods opening the heart maketh the word effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al. 4. Diligent regardful attention to the word, is the beginning of Converſion, or a great prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p n="15">15. And when ſhe was baptized, and her houſhold, ſhe beſought us, ſaying, If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my houſe and abide there. And ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained us.</p>
               <p rend="small">15. <hi>Note</hi> 1. It was the ordinary way of Apoſtles to Baptize Houſholds: Not that they could be ſure they were all true Believers, or that the Rulers could make them ſuch. But it was the Rulers duty to devote all in their Power to God; and therefore to do their beſt to perſwade them to a true conſent; and to rid their houſe of all unneceſſary Perſons that refuſed: And God uſed to bleſs their endeavours, and their intereſt and power might do much.</p>
               <p rend="small">2. Converted Perſons have ſo much love to Chriſts Miniſters who converted them, that they greatly deſire their Company and further help.</p>

And when they had laid many ſtripes upon them, they caſt them into priſon, charging the jayler to keep them ſafely. 24.

               <p>NOw when they had paſſed through Amphipolis, and Apollonia, they came to Theſſalonica, where was a Synagogue of the Jews. 2. And Paul, as his manner was went in unto them, and three ſabbath-days reaſoned with them out of the Scriptures, 3. Opening and alledging, that Chriſt muſt needs have ſuffered, and riſen again from the dead: and that this Jeſus whom I Preach unto unto you, is Chriſt.</p>

               <p n="4">4. And ſome of them believed, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorted with Paul and Silas: and of the devout Greeks a great multitude, and of the cheif women not a few.</p>
               <p rend="small">4. And being convinced by proof out of the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, that Chriſt muſt ſuffer and riſe again, many believed; ſome <hi>Jews,</hi> but more of the <hi>Proſelites</hi> and chief Women.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But the Jews which believed not, moved with envy, took unto them certain lewd fellows of the baſer ſort, and gathered a company, and ſet all the city on an uprore,
<pb facs="tcp:66325:132"/>
and aſſaulted the houſe of Jaſon, and ſought to bring them out to the people.</p>
               <p rend="small">5. <hi>Note,</hi> The rabble are fit inſtruments for perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for they have ſufficient ignorance and malignity, and will rage againſt reaſon: But its Legaliſts that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite them.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And when they found them not, they drew Jaſon, and certain brethren, unto the Rulers of the city, crying, Theſe that have turned the world up ſide down are come hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alſo? 7. Whom Jaſon hath received: and theſe all do contrary to the decrees of Ceſar, ſaying, That there is another King, one Jeſus.</p>
               <p rend="small">6, 7. <hi>Note,</hi> 1. Were it not for the falſe pretence of Sedition againſt Rulers, to engage their ſafety, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in jealouſie againſt Chriſt and Religion, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil would be poſed in his Accuſation of the Faithful. 2. The name of King Jeſus falſly Expounded, is it that is uſed to engage Princes againſt Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="8">8. And they troubled the people, and the Rulers of the city, when they heard theſe things. 9. And when they had taken ſecurity of Jaſon, and of the other, they let them go.</p>
               <p rend="small">8. <hi>Note,</hi> So Solicitous are men of their own ſafety, from the Rulers power, that all puts them into trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, which ſeemeth to bring them into any danger. Fears raiſe Commotions.</p>
               <p n="10">10. And the brethren immediately ſent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way Paul and Silas by night unto Berea? who coming thither, went into the Synagogue of the Jews.</p>
               <p rend="small">10. <hi>Note,</hi> 1. It is good to reſerve Perſecuted Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters for further work, when Satan would deſtroy them. 2. Again the Apoſtles make the <hi>Jews</hi> Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue their Preaching place.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Theſe were more noble then thoſe in Theſſalonica, in that they received the word with all readineſs of mind, and ſearched the Scriptures daily, whether thoſe things were ſo.</p>
               <p rend="small">11. Theſe were more ingenious rational ſober <hi>Jews,</hi> and did not meet the Goſpel with rage, but thought it worthy their ſerious enquiry, whether the Scriptures did foretell of the Death and Reſurrection of Chriſt, and whether <hi>Pauls</hi> proofs of Chriſtianity were va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Therefore many of them believed: alſo of honourable women which were Greeks, and of men not a few.</p>
               <p rend="small">12. This preparation of a ſober enquiry after truth, is a reaſon rendred, why many of them believed. As did many Men and Women of note.</p>
               <p n="13">13. But when the Jews of Theſſalonica had knowledge that the word of God was Preached of Paul at Berea, they came thither alſo, and ſtired up the people.</p>
               <p rend="small">13. <hi>Note,</hi> Satan ſends about his Meſſenger as Chriſt did his: To ſtir up the People.</p>
               <p n="14">14. And then immediately the brethren ſent away Paul, to go as it were to the ſea: but Silas and Timotheus abode there ſtill.</p>
               <p rend="small">14. <hi>Note,</hi> Not becauſe <hi>Paul</hi> was more fearful than the reſt, but that he was more uſeful and more mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.</p>
               <p n="15">15. And they that conducted Paul, brought him unto Athens: and receiving a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment unto Silas and Timotheus, for to come to him with all ſpeed, they depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p rend="small">15. <hi>Paul</hi> paſſing by many Countries between, was conducted to <hi>Athens,</hi> the great Seat or Univerſity of Philoſophy, to <hi>Greece</hi> and all the Learned World.</p>
               <p n="16">16. Now while Paul waited for them at Athens; his Spirit was ſtirred in him, when he ſaw the city wholly given to idolatry.</p>
               <p rend="small">16. He was much moved, to ſee ſuch abundance of Statues, Images and Altars in the City.</p>
               <p n="17">17. Therefore diſputed he in the Synagogue with the Jews, and with the devout perſons, and in the Market daily with them that met with him.</p>
               <p rend="small">17. Therefore he did not only diſpute for Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in the Sinagogue with the <hi>Jews,</hi> and devout Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers (who when converted, were uſually the firſt Members of the Churches) but alſo with the Heathens where he met them, againſt their Idolatry.</p>
               <p n="18">18. Then certain Philoſophers of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picureans, and of the Stoicks, encountred him: and ſome ſaid, What will this babbler ſay? other ſome, He ſeemeth to be a ſetter forth of ſtrange Gods? becauſe he Preached unto them Jeſus, and the Reſurrection.</p>
               <p rend="small">18. The <hi>Epicureans</hi> a looſe ſenſual Sect, and the <hi>Stoicks</hi> a ſtricter Sect encountred him; and ſome of them deſpiſing him as an unlearned Babler: Others thought that he Preacht ſome God (by the Name of Jeſus and the Reſurrection) not known to them before, <hi>Note,</hi> The <hi>Athenians</hi> were not only for liberty for every one to worſhip what God he would, but thought it the height of Religion to take in and worſhip the Gods of all Nations: And to pleaſe them all, and build them Altars.</p>
               <p n="19">19. And they took him, and brought him unto Areopagus, ſaying, May we know

               <p rend="small">19. They brought him to the Court of Judicature, who were to be Judges, before any new God was to be received, that they might hear what God it was that he Preached.</p>

               <p rend="small">23. Whatever was the occaſion of that Inſcription, you confeſs you worſhip an unknown God, I would therefore make known to you that only God, whom you muſt worſhip.</p>
               <p n="24">24. God that made the world, and all things therein, ſeeing that he is Lord of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth, dwelleth not in Temples made with hands: 25.

               <p n="27">27.28. Though he be not far from every one of us: For in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain alſo of your own poets have ſaid, For we are alſo his offſpring.</p>
               <p rend="small">27, 28. He is as neer us as our Souls are to our Bodys; Being indeed more than a Soul to all the World: For it is <hi>In him</hi> that we live and move and have our Being; As your Poet <hi>Aratus</hi> faith, For we are his off-ſpring: for of him, and through him, and to him are all things, and no Parent ſo much cauſeth us as God doth, nor doth the Soul ſo much to our life, motion and being as God doth.</p>
               <p n="29">29. Foraſmuch then as we are the offſpring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or ſilver, or ſtone graven by art and mans device.</p>
               <p rend="small">29. Our Souls being the beſt Image of God our Maker, we muſt not ſo much debaſe him as to make Images of him of Gold, Silver or Stone, as if he was like ſuch ſhapes.</p>
               <p n="30">30. And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commandeth all men every where to repent:</p>
               <p rend="small">30. And as man ſeemeth by forbearance a while to connive at faults, ſo God hath not in the time of this ignorance, either puniſhed the World as ſuch deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth, nor ſent them from Heaven that notice of his diſpleaſure, and that call to Repent and amend as now he doth, but left them moſtly to the Light of Nature and the diſcoveries of his Works and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: But now in hatred of Sin and Mercy to Sinners, he hath ſent a ſpecial Meſſenger to the World, to call all to Repentance, and offer them pardon thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p n="31">31. Becauſe he hath appointed a day in the which he will judge the world in righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, by that man whom he hath ordained; whereof he hath given aſſurance unto all men, in that he hath raiſed him from the dead.</p>
               <p rend="small">31. For he hath certainly determined to judge the World with Righteouſneſs, by that Man whom he hath ordained to be the Saviour of the Faithful and the Judge of all which (though it ſeem incredible to moſt, that a man ſhould be ſo advanced to be King and Judge of all the World, yet) God hath given certain proof of, by evidence ſufficient to evince it to true rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, in that he hath raiſed him from death to life, (and taken him up to Heaven.)</p>

               <p n="5">5. And when Silas and Timotheus were come from Macedonia, Paul was preſſed in Spirit, and teſtified to the Jews, that Jeſus was Chriſt.</p>
               <p rend="small">5. He was extraordinarily moved in Spirit more openly and earneſtly to teſtifie to the <hi>Jews</hi> that Jeſus is the Chriſt, to leave them without excuſe.</p>

And when they gainſayed and railed and blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Chriſt, he renounced and deſerted them by the Ceremony of ſhaking off the duſt as a witneſs, that their deſtruction was of themſelves and not by his neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect to convince them.

the Jews made inſurrection with one accord againſt Paul, and brought him to the judgment-ſeat,</p>

And when Paul was now about to open his mouth, Gallio, ſaid unto the Jews, If it were a matter of wrong, or wicked lewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, O ye Jews, reaſon would that I ſhould bear with you: 15. But if it be a queſtion of words and names, and of your law, look ye to it; for I will be no judge of ſuch matters.</p>
               <p rend="small">14. The <hi>Roman</hi> Law enabled not <hi>Gallio</hi> to decide the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Controverſies, but to puniſh men that wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one another, or committed any Wicked lewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>

               <p n="16">16. And he drave them from the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-ſeat. 17. Then all the Greeks took Soſthenes, the cheif Ruler of the Synagogue, and beat him before the judgement-ſeat: and Gallio cared for none of thoſe things.</p>
               <p rend="small">16, 17. <hi>Note,</hi> Its like theſe <hi>Greeks</hi> were Chriſtian Converts: They did ill in exerciſing revenge.</p>
               <p n="18">18. And Paul after this tarried there yet a good while, and then took his leave of the brethren, and ſailed thence into Syria, and with him Priſcilla and Aquila: having ſhorn his head in Cenchrea, for he had a vow.</p>
               <p rend="small">18. <hi>Note,</hi> It is uncertain whether it was <hi>Paul</hi> or <hi>Aquila,</hi> that is ſaid to cut his hair: but it ſeemeth liker to be <hi>Aquila.</hi> The Vow of <hi>Nazarites</hi> was not to cut their Hair, ſometime during life, and ſometime for a certain time: when it was ended they cut their Hair.</p>
               <p n="19">19. And he came to Epheſus, and left them there: but he himſelf entred into the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue, and reaſoned with the Jews.</p>

But bade them farewel, ſaying, I muſt by all means keep this feaſt that cometh, in Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem: but I will return again unto you, if God will. And he ſailed from Epheſus 22. And when he had landed at Ceſarea, and gone up and ſaluted the Church, he went down to Antioch.</p>

               <p rend="small">24, 25. He was well acquainted with the Scriptures, and believed ſo much of Chriſt as <hi>John</hi> had Preached, and was Baptized with his Baptiſm, but wanted yet much of the further knowledge of Chriſt, and of the Chriſtian Baptiſm.</p>
               <p n="26">26. And he began to ſpeak boldly in the Synagogue. Whom when Aquila and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcilla had heard, they took him unto them, and expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly.</p>

               <p>ANd it came to paſs, that while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul having paſſed through the upper coaſts, came to Epheſus: and finding certain Diſciples. 2. He ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>them, Have ye received the holy Ghoſt ſince ye believed? And they ſaid unto him, We have not ſo much as heard whether there be any holy Ghoſt. 3. And he ſaid unto them, Unto what then were ye Baptized? And they ſaid, Unto Johns Baptiſm.</p>
               <p rend="small">1. He found ſome that owned the Chriſtian Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion. 2. <hi>Note, Johns</hi> Preaching was, that the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah is now come, and thoſe that Repented and Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved this he Baptized, though they knew not that Jeſus was he: But to many he alſo pointed to Jeſus and ſaid, This is he. And theſe Diſciples its like were ſuch: and had learned no more.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Then ſaid Paul, John verily Baptiſed with the Baptiſm of repentance, ſaying unto the People, That they ſhould believe on him which ſhould come after him, that is, on Chriſt Jeſus. 5. When they heard this, they were Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed in the name of the Lord Jeſus.</p>
               <p rend="small">4. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid <hi>John</hi> Baptized thoſe who profeſſed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and Faith in the Meſſiah as juſt now at hand who indeed was Jeſus Chriſt. When theſe Diſciples heard that, they were expreſly Baptized (again) into the name of the Lord Jeſus.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the holy Ghoſt came on them and they ſpake with tongues, and propheſied. 7. And all the men were about twelve.</p>
               <p rend="small">6, 7. And<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the miraculous ſignal gift came on theſe men, when <hi>Paul</hi> had laid his hands on them.</p>

                  <hi>Note,</hi> The opinion of <hi>Matnixius</hi> and <hi>Beza</hi> that verſ. 5. was the ſpeech of <hi>Paul</hi> concerning <hi>Johns</hi> Converts, that they were Baptized in the name of the Lord Jeſus. 1.

It is contrary to the Context: For [They in <hi>verſ.</hi> 3. and and <hi>They</hi> in <hi>verſ.</hi> 5. and <hi>Them</hi> in <hi>verſ.</hi> 6. all plainly ſpeak of the ſame perſons. 3. It is contrary to the Hiſtory of <hi>Johns</hi> Baptiſm, who Baptized multitudes of the common People, Soldiers, Publicans and Phariſees upon a meer profeſſion of Repentance and belief of the Meſſiah at hand, and is never ſaid to have Baptized any into the Name of the Lord Jeſus. 4. Their reaſon for it is contrary to the Doctrine of Chriſtianity, as if <hi>Johns</hi> Baptiſm were ſo much the ſame with Chriſts that it is not to be perfected by the later. If any one then or now were Baptized only by <hi>Johns</hi> Baptiſm, he ought to be Baptized again. It is eſſential to Chriſtian Baptiſm, to be Baptized into the Name of the Father and of the Son (as buried and riſen with him) and of the Holy Ghoſt. But <hi>Johns</hi> Baptiſm had not all this; Therefore it is not the (now) Chriſtian Baptiſm.</p>
               <p n="8">8. And he went into the Synagogue, and ſpake boldly for the ſpace of three months, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting and perſwading the things concerning the Kingdom of God.</p>

               <p n="9">9. But when divers were hardened, and believed not, but ſpake evil of that way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the multitude, he departed from them, and ſeparated the Diſciples, diſputing daily in the School of one Tyrannus.</p>
               <p rend="small">9. The Ears of Chriſtians being unfit to bear their reproaching and blaſpheming of Chriſt, he ſeparated the Diſciples from the publick Synagogue of the <hi>Jews</hi> to a private School.</p>
               <p n="10">10. And this continued by the ſpace of two years; ſo that all they which dwelt in Aſia, heard the word of the Lord Jeſus, both Jews and Greeks.</p>
               <p rend="small">10. By two years Teaching and Diſputing the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel was ſpread through all <hi>Aſia</hi> proconſular.</p>
               <p n="11">11. And God wrought ſpecial miracles by the hands of Paul: 12. So that from his body were brought unto the ſick, handkerchiefs or aprons, and the diſeaſes departed from them, and the evil Spirits went out of them.</p>
               <p rend="small">11, 12. So Many and great were the Miracles and Cures done by <hi>Pauls</hi> means, that his corporal preſence could not ſerve all, but by Cloaths ſent from his Body they at a diſtance were cured.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Then certain of the vagabond Jews, exorciſts, took upon them to call over them which had evil Spirits, the name of the Lord Jeſus, ſaying, We adjure you by Jeſus whom Paul Preacheth. 14. And there were ſeven ſons of one Sceva a Jew, and cheif of the Prieſts, which did ſo.</p>
               <p rend="small">13.

               <p n="15">15. And the evil Spirit anſwered and ſaid,

Jeſus I know, and Paul I know; but who are ye? 16. And the man in whom the evil Spirit was, leapt on them, and overcame them, and prevailed againſt them, ſo that they fled out of that houſe naked and wounded.</p>
               <p rend="small">15. Words without Faith would not work to caſt out Devils, and Chriſt would not give power to his Name uſed as a Charm: but Satan ſtrengthened the Man to wound and ſhame them.</p>
               <p n="17">17. And this was known to all the Jews and Greeks alſo dwelling at Epheſus; and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jeſus was magnified.</p>
               <p rend="small">17. This being commonly known, the name of Chriſt was more reverenced and honoured.</p>
               <p n="18">18. And many that believed came and confeſſed, and ſhewed their deeds.</p>
               <p rend="small">18. Many Converts openly confeſſed their former evil deeds</p>
               <p n="19">19. Many alſo of them which uſed curious arts, brought their books together, and burned them before all men: and they counted the price of them, and found it fifty thouſand pieces of ſilver. 20. So mightily grew the word of God, and prevailed.</p>
               <p rend="small">19. To ſhew the truth of their Repentance by the Renunciation of their former deluſions, and that no men elſe might be hurt by their ill Books or make an ill uſe of them, they would not ſell but burn their Books of Magick and Charms and Idolatrous Rites and Divinations: though the price amounted to a very great ſum (not pretending as <hi>Judas</hi> that this Money might have been given to the poor.) This ſhewed the power of Gods Word and Grace, which ſo prevailed againſt Deluſions and the love of Money.</p>
               <p n="21">21. After theſe things were ended, Paul purpoſed in the Spirit, when he had paſſed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jeruſalem, ſaying, After I have been there, I muſt alſo ſee. Rome. 22.

               <p rend="small">14. We ſaw by his reſolution and unperſwadable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that it was Gods will; and we ſubmitted to it.</p>
               <p n="15">15. And after thoſe days we took up our carriages, and went up to Jeruſalem. 16. There went with us alſo certain of the Diſciples of Ceſarea, and brought with them one Muaſon of Cyprus, an old Diſciple, with whom we ſhould lodge. 17. And when we were come to Jeruſalem, the brethren received us glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
               <p rend="small">15. <hi>Muaſon</hi> lodged us, and the Church gladly own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us.</p>
               <p n="18">18. And the day following Paul went in with us unto James; and all the Elders were preſent.</p>

               <p n="19">19. And when he had ſaluted them, he decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red particularly what things God had wrought among the Gentiles by his miniſtery. 20. And when they heard it, they glorified the Lord.</p>
               <p rend="small">19. They rejoyced and thanked God for the ſucceſs of the Goſpel on the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and ſcattered the <hi>Jews</hi> abroad.</p>
               <p n="20">20. And ſaid unto him, Thou ſeeſt, brother, how many thouſands of Jews there are which believe, and they are all zealous of the law. 21. And they are informed of thee, that thou teacheſt all the Jews which are among the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles to forſake Moſes, ſaying, that they ought not to circumciſe their Children, neither to walk after the cuſtoms.</p>
               <p rend="small">20, 21. They are told, that thou teacheſt not only the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> but the <hi>Jews</hi> to forſake Circumciſion, and <hi>Moſes</hi> Law and the Cuſtomes.</p>
               <p n="22">22. What is it therefore? the multitude muſt needs come together: for they will hear that thou art come. 23. Do therefore this that we ſay to thee: we have four men which have a vow on them; 24 Them take, and purifie thy ſelf with them, and be at charges with them, that they may ſhave their heads: and all may know that thoſe things whereof they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed concerning thee, are nothing, but that thou thy ſelf alſo walkeſt orderly, and keepeſt the law.</p>
               <p rend="small">22. The Multitude of Chriſtian <hi>Jews</hi> will hear of thy coming, deliver them thus from this offence; we have four Men that made the <hi>Nazarites</hi> vow to abſtain from ſome things a certain time, which is now expired, and they are to ſhave themſelves ceremoniouſly in the Temple: Go thou with them, and perform there the Legal Ceremonies of Purification, and be at the coſt of this ſolemnity on them, that the People may know, that the report of thee is not true, but that thou being a <hi>Jew</hi> doſt thy ſelf keep the Law.</p>
               <p rend="small">
                  <hi>Note,</hi> The Law was by Chriſt abrogated as to the uſe of the Types and Ceremonies, as ſignifying him that was to come, The Political part ceaſed when their poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie was diſſolved by their ruine: And the moral natural part Chriſt continued as his Law. And the Abrogati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the reſt was not fully made known at firſt, but by degrees; and the exerciſe of it long tolerated to the <hi>Jews.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="25">25. As touching the Gentiles which believe, we have written and concluded, that they obſerve no ſuch thing, ſave only that they keep themſelves from things offered to idols, and from bloud, and from ſtrangled, and from fornication.</p>
               <p rend="small">25. We intend not this for the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> nor would bring them under the yoak of <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="26">26. Then Paul took the men, and the next day purifying himſelf with them, entrod into the Temple, to ſignifie the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the days of purification, until that an offering ſhould be offered for every one of them.</p>
               <p rend="small">26. <hi>Paul</hi> did as they adviſed him, and performed all the Ceremonies required, and came to the Temple to make it known, that the days of Purification were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed, till they were to offer.</p>
               <p n="27">27. And when the ſeven days were almoſt

ended, the Jews which were of Aſia, when they ſaw him in the Temple, ſtirred up all the people, and laid hands on him, 28. Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, Men of Iſrael help: this is the man that teacheth all men every where againſt the people, and the law, and this place: and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, brought Greeks alſo into the Temple, and hath polluted this holy place. 29. (For they had ſeen before with him in the city, Trophimus an Epheſian, whom they ſuppoſed that Paul had brought into the Temple.)</p>
               <p rend="small">27. <hi>Note,</hi> Some think that God let out this afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on <hi>Paul,</hi> for complying ſo far to pleaſe the People; as if it had been carnal Councel which he followed. But that is not to be ſuppoſed; that both the Apoſtles and Elders, and he himſelf, who was guided by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, ſhould herein err and be miſled: This would leave us uncertain of the truth of their writings. But it was the way of fulfilling Gods decree; and tells us what a task it is to have to do with ſuch Men: Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be pleaſed or not, we muſt ſuffer by them.</p>
               <p n="30">30. And all the city was moved, and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ran together: and they took Paul, and drew him out of the Temple: and forthwith the doors were ſhut.</p>
               <p rend="small">30. In blind rage they drag'd him out of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple as a Profaner of it.</p>
               <p n="31">31. And as they went about to kill him, tidings came unto the cheif captain of the band, that all Jeruſalem was in an uprore.</p>
               <p rend="small">31. This ſort of zeal maketh Men think it no ſin but a ſerving of God, to murder the beſt of Saints, as a Sacrifice to their Holy Temple and Ceremonies.</p>
               <p n="32">32. Who immediately took Souldiers, and centurions, and ran down unto them: and when they ſaw the cheif Captain and the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, they left beating of Paul.</p>
               <p rend="small">32, <hi>Note.</hi> 1. Even a Heathen Government is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than the Popular rage of blind ceremonious ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious Zealots. 2. Heathens are oft the Protectors of Chriſtians, againſt the blind rage of thoſe that profeſs devotion to the ſame God.</p>
               <p n="33">33. Then the cheif Captain came near and took him, and commanded him to be bound with two Chains; and demanded who he was, and what he had done? 34. And ſome cried one thing, ſome another, among the multitude: and when he could not know the certainty for the tumult, he commanded him to be carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the Caſtle.</p>
               <p rend="small">33, 34. A Heathen would hear the cauſe before he judges it, when ſuperſtitious Zealots execute before they try or hear.</p>
               <p n="35">35. And when he came upon the ſtairs, ſo it was that he was born of the Souldiers, for the violence of the people. 36. For the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of the people followed after, crying, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with him.</p>
               <p rend="small">35. The Heathen Soldiers were fain by force, to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and guard him from theſe Hypocrites.</p>
               <p n="37">37. And as Paul was to be led into the caſtle, he ſaid unto the cheif Captain, May I ſpeak unto thee? Who ſaid, Canſt thou ſpeak Greek? 38. Art not thou that Egyptian which before theſe days madeſt an uprore, and leddeſt out into the wilderneſs four thouſand men that were murderers?</p>
               <p rend="small">37, 38. The tumult about him made him ſuſpect him to be an Incendiary that had lately raiſed ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p n="39">39. But Paul ſaid, I am a man which am a Jew of Tarſus, a citizen of no mean city: and I beſeech thee, ſuffer me to ſpeak unto the people. 40. And when he had given him licence, Paul ſtood on the ſtairs, and beckened with the hand unto the people: and when there was made a great ſilence, he ſpake unto them in the Hebrew tongue, ſaying.</p>
               <p rend="small">39, 40. When he had given him leave to ſpeak, and procured ſilence and audience by his Authority, which elſe the Multitude of Legal Zealots would not have granted him, he ſpake to them in the Chaldec Tongue than called the Hebrew, becauſe it was underſtood by a greater number than the Greek. This ſheweth that Greek was not then moſt common.</p>

               <p rend="small">1. I am a <hi>Jew</hi> brought up a Diſciple of <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſame Laws and cuſtoms, and as zealous for God in your way, as you now are.</p>

               <p rend="small">4 And as you are affected with zealous cruelty now againſt Chriſtians, ſo was I then, and perſecuted them even to death, binding and delivering them into Priſon, both Men and Women.</p>

What Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites were theſe Phariſees that could thus embody with damnable Hereticks, and yet could not endure Chriſtians, but ſilenced and murdered them like the Papiſts Prelates who can endure <hi>Jews</hi> and Atheiſts, while they burn or ſilence Proteſtants.</p>
               <p n="9">9. And there aroſe a great cry and the ſcribes that were of the Phariſees part aroſe, and ſtrove, ſaying We find no evil in this man: but if a ſpirit or an angel hath ſpoken to him, let us not fight againſt God.</p>

               <p n="10">10. And when there aroſe a great diſſenſion the chief captain fearing leſt Paul ſhould have been pulled in pieces of them, commanded the ſouldiers to go down, and to take him by force from among them, and to bring him, into the caſtle. 11. And the night following, the Lord ſtood by him, and ſaid, Be of good cheer, Paul: for as thou haſt teſtified of me in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, ſo muſt thou bear witneſs alſo at Rome.</p>
               <p rend="small">11. <hi>Note,</hi> Gods encouragements accompany his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands and faithful ſervice.</p>
               <p n="12">12. And when it was day, certain of the Jews banded together, and bound themſelves under a curſe ſaying, that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul.</p>
               <p rend="small">12. <hi>Note,</hi> Seeing the Phariſes now ſpake for him, it ſeems all or moſt of theſe furious men were Sadducees; who were then the ſtrongeſt Party. And even to this day, thoſe that believe no life to come, are the moſt cruel Enemies of Believers: And what ſhould deter ſuch from bloody Vows, Conſpiracies and Perjuries? When yet only Devilliſh malice doth provoke them.</p>
               <p n="13">13. And they were more then fourty which had made this conſpiracy. 14. And they came to the chief prieſts and elders, and ſaid, We have bound our ſelves under a great curſe, that we will eat nothing until we have ſlain Paul. 15. Now therefore ye with the council, ſignifie to the chief captain, that he bring him down unto you to morrow, as though ye would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire ſomething more perfectly concerning him: and we, or ever he come near, are ready to kill him.</p>
               <p rend="small">13. O what a Clergy was this, that muſt head a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy of murdering Sadducees.</p>
               <p n="16">16. And when Pauls ſiſters Son heard of their lying in wait, he went and entred into the caſtle, and told Paul. 17. Then Paul called one of the centurions unto him, and ſaid, Bring this young man unto the chief captain: for he hath a certain thing to tell him. 18. So he took him, and brought him to the chief cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and ſaid, Paul the priſoner called me unto him, and prayed me to bring this young man unto thee, who hath ſomething to ſay unto thee. 19. Then the chief captain took him by the hand, and went with him aſide privately, and aſked him, What is that thou haſt to tell me? 20. And he ſaid, The Jews have agreed to deſire thee, that thou wouldeſt bring down Paul to morrow into the council, as though they would enquire ſomewhat him more perfectly. 21. But do not thou yield unto them: for there lie in wait for him of them more then fourty men, which have bound themſelves with an oath, that they will neither eat nor drink till they have killed him: and now are they ready, looking for a promiſe from thee.</p>
               <p rend="small">16, <hi>Note,</hi> 1. No Conſpiracies are kept ſecret from God, who can detect and fruſtrate them 2. No doubt but theſe Men that could Vow to ſatisfie rage, did brake it rather than famiſh.</p>
               <p n="22">22. So the chief captain then let the young man depart, and charged him, See thou tell no man that thou haſt ſhewed theſe things to me, 23. And he called unto him two centuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſaying, Make ready two hundred ſouldiers to go to Ceſarea, and horſemen threeſcore and ten, and ſpearmen two hundred, at the third hour of the night. 24.

               <p n="13">13. And after certain days, King Agrippa and Bernice came unto Ceſarea to ſalute Feſtus. 14. And when they had been there many days, Feſtus declared Pauls cauſe unto the King, ſaying, There is a certain man left in bonds by Felix: 15. About whom, when I was at Jeruſalem, the cheif prieſts and the Elders of the Jews informed me deſiring to have Judgment againſt him.</p>
               <p rend="small">13. <hi>Note.</hi> This <hi>Agrippa</hi> was the Son of that <hi>Herod</hi> that was eaten to death by Worms, and <hi>Bernice</hi> was his Siſter, the Wife of <hi>Polemon</hi> King of <hi>Cilicia,</hi> who left her Husband and lived with his Brother.</p>
               <p n="16">16. To whom I anſwered, It is not the manner of the Romans to deliver any man to die, before that he which is accuſed, have the accuſers face to face, and have licence to anſwer for himſelf concerning the crime laid againſt him.</p>
               <p rend="small">16. The <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Religious Tyrants had overcome and caſt off this Law of Nature, which the Heathens kept.</p>
               <p n="17">17. Therefore when they were come hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, without any delay on the morrow I ſat on the Judgment-ſeat, and I commanded the man to be brought forth. 18. Againſt whom when the accuſers ſtood up, they brought none accuſation of ſuch things as I ſuppoſed: 19. But had certain queſtions againſt him of their own ſuperſtition, and of one Jeſus, which was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive.</p>
               <p rend="small">17, 19. <hi>Note,</hi> Theſe things he made light of as not underſtanding them.</p>
               <p n="20">20. And becauſe I doubted of ſuch manner of queſtions, I asked him whether he would go to Jeruſalem, and there be judged of theſe matters. 21. But when Paul had appealed to be reſerved unto the hearing of Auguſtus, I commanded him to be kept till I might ſend him to Caeſar.</p>
               <p rend="small">20. I would have had him tryed by the <hi>Jews</hi> who underſtood their own Law, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p n="22">22. Then Agrippa ſaid unto Feſtus, I would alſo hear the man my ſelf. To morrow, ſaid he, thou ſhalt hear him. 23. And on the morrow when Agrippa was come, and Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice, with great pomp, and was entred into the place of hearing, with the cheif Captains and Principal men of the city, at Feſtus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment Paul was brought forth. 24.

Unto which promiſe our twelve tribes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly ſerving God day and night, hope to come for which hopes ſake, King Agrippa, I am accuſed of the Jews.</p>

In ſuch Captivating Tranſplanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, they never carry away all the poor People that muſt Till the Ground, but the Rulers, Soldiers, great Men and Men of Note; elſe it would be the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers loſs: So it hath been here, at the Conqueſts made by the <hi>Romans, Saxons</hi> and <hi>Deans</hi> and <hi>Normans</hi>: The grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter number of the Country People ſtill ſtaid as Tenants or Servants to the Conquerers. 2. The Neigbourhood of the <hi>Jews,</hi> did by degrees ſhame away much of the Idolatry of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi>: As <hi>Joſiabs</hi> power extended to pull down their Idols and Altars, and burn mens bones on them. 3.

               <p n="8">8. Why ſhould it be thought a things incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible with you, that God ſhould raiſe the dead.</p>
               <p rend="small">8. The great point of our Controverſie now is, Whether Chriſt roſe from the Dead? And why ſhould this ſeem an incredible thing to you? Is it too hard for God who upholdeth all the World, and giveth life to all that live.</p>
               <p n="9">9. I verily thought with my ſelf, that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jeſus of Nazareth.</p>
               <p rend="small">9. I once was of your mind, and did not only ſet light by the Name of Jeſus, but thought I ought to ſet my ſelf againſt it, and oppoſe them that Preached and Profeſſed it.</p>

               <p rend="small">10. In this blindneſs I was a Perſecuter of the Saints.</p>
               <p n="11">11. And I puniſhed them oft in every Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angogue, and compelled them to blaſpheme; and being exceedingly mad againſt them, I perſecuted them even unto ſtrange Cities.</p>

               <p n="12">12. Whereupon as I went to Damaſcus with authority and commiſſion from the chief Prieſts; 13. At midday, O King, I ſaw in the way a light from Heaven, above the brightneſs of the Sun, ſhining round about me, and them which journeyed with me. 14. And when we were all ſallen to the Earth, I heard a voice ſpeaking unto me, and ſaying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuteſt thou me?

into Italy, and he put us therein. 7. And when we had ſailed ſlowly many days, and ſcarce were come over againſt Cuidus, the wind, not ſuffering us, we ſailed under Creet, over againſt Salmone. 8. And hardly paſſing it, came unto a place which is called the fair havens, nigh whereunto was the city of Laſea.</p>

               <p rend="small">33. <hi>Note,</hi> Not that they had eat nothing in four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen days: But ſay ſome Expoſitors, no ſet meal, or ſo little as was next to nothing; But others more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably ſay [you have eaten nothing all this (one) day, expecting the fourteenth day as Critical.</p>
               <p n="35">35. And when he had thus ſpoken, he took bread, and gave thanks to God in preſence of them all, and when he had broken it, he began to eat.</p>

               <p n="36">36. Then were they all of good cheer, and they alſo took ſome meat. 37. And we were in all in the ſhip, two hundred threeſcore and ſixteen ſouls.</p>

And when they had taken up the ancres, they committed themſelves unto the Sea, and looſed the Rudder bands, and and hoyſed up the main ſail to the wind, and made toward the ſhore. 41. And ſaling into a place where two Seas meet, they ran the ſhip a ground, and the fore-part ſtuck faſt, and remained unmoveable, but the hinder part was broken with the violence of the waves.</p>
               <p rend="small">39. This was a ſhallow near a neck of Land called an <hi>Iſtmus</hi> where the Sea is on both ſides it. The <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaſſes</hi> call it to this day St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Landing place.</p>

And it came to paſs that the father of Publius lay ſick of a fever, and of a bloudy flux: to whom Paul entred in, and prayed, and laid his hands on him, and healed him. 9. So when this was done, others alſo which had diſeaſes in the Iſland came, and were healed: 10. Who alſo honoured us with many honours, and when we departed, they laded us with ſuch things as were neceſſary</p>
               <p rend="small">7. <hi>Note,</hi> If we could pray as <hi>Paul</hi> did and heal all the Sick by it; <hi>Queſt.</hi> Whether men would impriſon us for it? <hi>Anſw.</hi> The ſick or the healed would not, but its not unlike that <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Prieſts would do it; for ſo they did.</p>
               <p n="11">11. And after three moneths we departed in a ſhip of Alexandria, which had wintered in the iſle, whoſe ſign was Caſtor and Pollux. 12. And landing at Syracuſe, we tarried there three days. 13. And from thence we fetcht a compaſs, and came to Rhegium: and after one day the ſouth-wind blew, and we came the next day to Puteoli: 14. Where we found brethren, and were deſired to tarry with them ſeven days: and ſo we went toward Rome.</p>
               <p rend="small">14. <hi>Note,</hi> It appeareth by this that the Goſpel had been received before <hi>Paul</hi>'s coming thither, in the <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> Country about <hi>Rome</hi>? Whether theſe Brethren entertained all the Soldiers and Priſoners ſeven days, or <hi>Paul</hi> and his Company only as truſted by the <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turian</hi> to come after him, is uncertain.</p>

            <head>The Epiſtle of PAUL the Apoſtle to the ROMANS.</head>
            <head type="sub">The INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>FOr the underſtanding of <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> it is neceſſary, I. To under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand his main Deſign and Subject. II. To that end, to know what Parties he had to do with. III. And what their ſeveral Errours were, or their Temptations to Errour. IV. And by what Arguments he oppoſeth them, and what he granteth them.</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>Paul</hi>'s great Deſign is to eſtabliſh the <hi>Roman</hi> Chriſtians in the Faith of the Goſpel, and in Holineſs of Life, and in mutual Love and Concord againſt all the Temptations which then aſſaulted them.</p>
            <p n="2">II. The Adverſaries of their Stability, and his Deſign, whom he noteth, are, 1. The <hi>Roman</hi> Heathens, eſpecially the Learned ſort. 2. Eſpecially the Jews, and the Judaizing Chriſtians. 3. Some Erroneous Heretical Chriſtians, who were inclined both to Liberti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm, and to Diviſions.</p>
            <p n="3">III. The Errours oppoſed by him were, I. The Heathens, who while they ſcorned the Faith of a Crucified Chriſt, ſhewed how little they were to be regarded by their Sins againſt the Light of Nature.</p>
            <p n="2">II. The Jews had all theſe following Errours. 1. Becauſe God had made them a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar People, by ſpecial Privileges and Promiſes, they were over-proud of it, as if they had been the onely Servants that God had in World, and that none but Jews and their Proſelytes were ſaved. 2. And ſo, that their Law was to be received by all the World. 3. That this Law, given to, and by <hi>Moſes,</hi> for their Government as a peculiar Republick, was ſo excellent, becauſe thus Divine, that the keeping of it was the ſufficient and onely way of Salvation. 4. Herein they overlook'd the Promiſe which was before the Law, and preſuppoſed in the Law, as its Foundation, and its very Life; both the Common Promiſe made to lapſed Mankind in <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Noah,</hi> and the ſpiritual part of the Special Promiſe made to <hi>Abraham.</hi> 2. And they overlook'd the ſignification of their Types and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies; and look'd at the Law meerly as a Law of Works, rewarding or puniſhing for the doing or not doing it.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Therefore they miſtook the promiſed <hi>Meſſiah</hi> to be a King of <hi>David</hi>'s Line, who was to reſtore their Commonwealth, and ſubdue the Nations to it, and rule them in earthly Glory by that Law; and ſo made him ſubſervient to <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law, as to be reſtored by him.</p>
            <p n="6">6. And ſo they thought that this Law muſt endure for ever, and that to talk of its ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation was Blaſphemy againſt God.</p>
            <p n="3">III. The Judaizing Chriſtians conjoyned Chriſtianity and the Law, and thought, that though Chriſt's Miracles, Reſurrection, and Spirit proved him to be the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> who died for their Sins, yet he came not to change their Law, but to eſtabliſh it: And firſt, they were long before they could be convinced, that it was not neceſſary to the Gentiles to be Proſelytes to it: And when they were forced to grant that, they ſtill held, that it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to all the Jews. And therefore they kept up their Ceremonies, and ſeparated too far from the Gentile Chriſtians: And the Gentile Chriſtians too much deſpiſed theſe.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. Beſides theſe, there were ſome that Heretically took it to be a part of their extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Knowledge, to hold, That Chriſtianity delivered Men not onely from the Jews Law, but from ſubjection to Men, and from neceſſary ſtrictneſs in outward Actions: And they made a Party for theſe Opinions.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb facs="tcp:66325:147"/>V. The Apoſtle, I. dealeth but briefly with the Heathens, and argueth againſt them from their own Errours and Crimes; 1. Telling them of the Light of Nature, and then of their odious Sins againſt it; that the Chriſtians might not be moved by the ſcorns and oppoſition of ſuch a blinded uncapable ſort of Adverſaries.</p>
            <p n="2">II. But the chief Work of his Epiſtle is to confute the Jews and Judaizers, and to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh the Gentile Chriſtians againſt their Errours and Oppoſition. To which end, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth all theſe things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the Gentiles are not bound to receive the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and become Jews. 2. That they may be juſtified and ſaved by the Faith of Chriſt, as well as the Jews. 3. That God foretold their Calling by the Prophets, and the Promiſe to <hi>Abraham</hi> extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them, as the Spiritual Believing Seed or Children. 4. That if this were not true, none could be juſtified or ſaved, becauſe by the Deeds of the Law, as ſuch, no man can be juſtified. The Jews themſelves muſt be juſtified by Faith, or not at all. 5. That the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> as ſuch, came long after the Promiſe, and the Juſtification of <hi>Abraham</hi> by Faith, and therefore could not null that Promiſe, or way of Life. 6. That the Law required ſuch a degree of Works, or ſtrict Obedience, as no man kept; and therefore none could be juſtified by it. 7. That the Law was given but to the Jews, and God is not onely the God and Governour of the Jews, but of the Gentiles alſo. 8. That the Law forbiddeth Sin, and curſeth the Sinner, and condemneth him, and therefore doth not juſtifie him. 9. That the Law, as ſuch, giveth not Grace and Strength to keep it, but ſuppoſeth Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity: But the Grace and Spirit of Chriſt enableth. 10. That the Law by accident irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tateth Luſt, and increaſeth it, and doth not mortifie and overcome it. 11. That the Law was given to another end, than to juſtifie the Sinner by its bare Works; even to convince Men of Sin, and the need of Grace, and as a Schoolmaſter to lead them to Chriſt, who is the End of the Law. 12. That Pardon, Juſtification, and Salvation muſt needs be God's free Gift to the Guilty and Condemned, and not the Reward of Meritorious Works of the Law; nor can any pretend the Title of Innocency or Debt. 13. That Chriſt is deſigned to gather a more large and excellent Church than the Jewiſh Nation, even a Catholick Church through all the World, and that more ſpiritual and holy; into which the Jews, if they will believe, ſhall be all graffed, which will be to them a higher Privilege than to live under the Moſaick Politie. 14. That the Jewiſh Law was ſo operous, ſhadowy, bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſom, and terrible, that it is part of the Office of a Saviour to deliver men from it, and to bring them under a far better Law and Covenant of Grace.</p>
            <p>By many ſuch Arguments he confuteth the Jews, and Judaizing Chriſtians.</p>
            <p n="3">III. How he confuteth the Cenſorious Dividers, who agreed in the Eſſentials of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, but differed about ſome Jewiſh Rites; and alſo the Erroneous, that enclined to Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiouſneſs, and unjuſt Separation from the Orthodox, will be ſufficiently ſhewn in the particular Expoſitions.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. But the Apoſtle denieth none of theſe following Truths, but implieth ſome, and expreſly aſſerteth others of them, as Conceſſions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. According to the Promiſe made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were a holy Nation, and a peculiar People, ſeparated to God out of all World.</p>
            <p n="2">2. God's Gvoernment firſt ſetled over them was eminently a Theocracy, the Supremacy being exerciſed by extraordinary Revelation, by Angelical or Signal Notices, and by Prophecy.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Their Law was eminently Divine, the Law of God; their Princes being but Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioners, and not having Power of Legiſlation, to add, abrogate, or diminiſh.</p>
            <p n="4">4. This Law was wholly Political; that is, The Rule of the Subjects Obedience, and the Rewards and Puniſhments, to be exerciſed by God as Supreme, and by Magiſtrates as his Officers, in the Government of that People as a Holy Commonwealth. Even the Decalogue and Ceremonies were ſuch Laws of Politie.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb facs="tcp:66325:147"/>5. But this Law ſuppoſed the Law of Nature, and the antecedent Law of Mercy made to ſaln Mankind in <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Noah,</hi> and the ſpecial Promiſe made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and all the Nations of the Earth in his Seed: And the Jews ought not to have ſeparated any part of their Law from theſe, which were as its very Life and Soul, and principally reſpected things ſpiritual, and heavenly, and everlaſting.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The Law preſuppoſing theſe, and being given to men that had Immortal Souls, and bound to know ſo much, doth not much mention ſuch matters of the Life to come, as being preſuppoſed; and <hi>Moſes</hi> adding ſpecially the diſtinguiſhing Laws of Jewiſh Government.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The breach even of a Political Law, where God was the Legiſlator, deſerved future everlaſting Puniſhment, though as Men were the official Executioners, it was but corporal Puniſhment that it inflicted.</p>
            <p n="8">8. The Sacrifices were Obſignations of that Law of Grace which was elder than <hi>Moſes,</hi> and ſo they ſhould have been underſtood.</p>
            <p n="9">9. The ſincere keeping of that Law, while it was in force, was the Material part of the Jews Obedience as they were under the Law of Grace.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Even the Decalogue it ſelf, as Moſaical and Political, delivered in Stone to the Jews onely, is done away with all the reſt by Chriſt, their peculiar Commonwealth being ended: But as it is, 1. the Law of Nature, 2. and the Law of Chriſt, it ſtill continueth.</p>
            <p>There are three Controverſies that I will here briefly ſpeak to, rather than by inſerted Annotations afterwards. I. Whom <hi>Paul</hi> deſcribeth in the firſt and ſecond Chapters. II. What Law it is that he ſpeaketh of. III. How he meaneth, that Faith is imputed to Righteouſneſs and Juſtification.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A late Writer hath laboured hard to perſuade us, that <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. and a great part of the Epiſtles ſpeak of the <hi>Gnoſticks,</hi> which have uſually been otherwiſe expounded. Of this Chapter I think otherwiſe, (and of many other Texts) becauſe, 1. The Philoſophers, and other Heathens, were ſo much more potent, numerous, and famous Adverſaries to Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, that we have great reaſon to ſuſpect, that <hi>Paul</hi> doth not ſo much paſs them by, to pelt at a few Hereticks, as this Writer imagined.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Text agreeth more to the Heathens. It was to them that the Goſpel was a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ſhame, and counted fooliſhneſs. It was not by the Works of Creation chiefly that the <hi>Gnoſticks</hi> pretended to know God, or ſhould have known him; but this was the onely Book to the Heathens. The <hi>Gnoſticks</hi> were unexcuſable, as Profeſſours of Faith; but it was the Heathens that were left without excuſe by the meer Works of God's Creation. The Heathen Philoſophers were they that profeſt the greateſt Wiſdom, deriding all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians as Fools. It was the Heathens that were the Authors of all that Imagery and Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, named <hi>ver.</hi> 23. The <hi>Gnoſticks</hi> were but for involuntary Complyance in caſe of danger: They renounced worſhipping the Creature more than the Creator. The Sodomy, and all the other Sins by which they are deſcribed, belong far more to the Heathens than to the <hi>Gnoſticks. Chap.</hi> 2. <hi>Paul</hi> diſtributeth them that he ſpeaks of, into [<hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi>], and ſo doth the whole ſcope of his Diſcourſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2. It is the ſame ſort that he there ſpeaketh of, as the Wiſe, and Great, and Noble of the World, who counted the Wiſdom of the Goſpel Fooliſhneſs, and whoſe Wiſdom was Fooliſhneſs, which God would confound and bring to nought, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which is the plain Deſcription of the Philoſophical Heathens. A great deal more ſuch Evidence is at hand.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Writers of Church-Hiſtory and Hereſies tell us of many ſorts of Hereticks in the beginning, that went before thoſe called <hi>Gnoſticks</hi>; yet none of theſe are named in Scripture, but the <hi>Nicolaitans,</hi> and the Woman <hi>Jezebel, Rev.</hi> 2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 3. And why ſhould we think then that the <hi>Gnoſticks</hi> are meant more than they?</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb facs="tcp:66325:148"/>4. Thoſe that <hi>Paul</hi> oft ſingleth out, ſeem to be them mentioned <hi>Acts</hi> 15. againſt whom he reaſoneth to the <hi>Galatians, &amp;c.</hi> Had he meant others, as their Crimes were greater, he would have as plainly notified them. Indeed, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. and <hi>Jude,</hi> ſeem to mean the <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laitans</hi> as much like the <hi>Gnoſticks</hi>; but <hi>Paul</hi> had much more to do with the Heathen Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Some have thought that it is the <hi>Law of Innocency</hi> made firſt to <hi>Adam,</hi> which <hi>Paul</hi> meaneth, when he ſpeaks againſt Juſtification by the Works of the Law. Their chief Reaſons are, 1. Becauſe it ſaith, <hi>Curſed is he that doth not all things written, &amp;c.</hi> And hence they gather, That the Jews Law was of the ſame tenor. 2. But others give this Reaſon, Becauſe the Jews Law was a Covenant of Grace, and therefore could not be that here deſcribed,</p>
            <p>But it is evident all along, that it was <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law that <hi>Paul</hi> here meaneth. It would be tedious to cite the Proofs all along viſible. And as to the Reaſons for the contrary, 1. It is certain, that the Law of Innocency was not then in being and force, but ceaſed with Man's Innocency, upon <hi>Adam</hi>'s Fall; not by mutability in God, but in Man. God's Law is the preſent Obligation of his Will to Duty or Puniſhment. Shall we imagine God to ſay to the ſinful World, 1. <hi>I command thee, that art a guilty Sinner, to be ſinleſs?</hi> (contrary to the hypothetical neceſſity of Exiſtence.) 2. And, <hi>thou ſhalt be rewarded, if thou be innocent,</hi> (when he is guilty already.) 3. And, <hi>if thou be a ſinner, thou ſhalt die,</hi> (when he is a Sinner already, and the <hi>Conditional</hi> is become <hi>Abſolute,</hi> and paſt into a Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Judgment.)</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> granteth Sacrifice and Pardon for many Sins; but the Law of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency pardoneth none.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The meaning of [<hi>Curſed be he that doth not all things</hi>] is not, <hi>Curſed be he that hath any Sin</hi>; but, <hi>he that keepeth not all this Law</hi>: (And onely the Jews were under that Law, and its Curſe.) And this Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> was ſo operous and ſtrict, that no man did perfectly fulfil it: And if they had, it would not procure their Pardon for the common Sin of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, nor merit any thing of God, by the benefit he received by their Works.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And as to the other Objecters, It's true, that <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law was given to them as a material peculiar part of the Law of Grace: But thoſe, that <hi>Paul</hi> diſputed againſt, had in conceit ſeparated the Law, as ſuch, from the Promiſe or Covenant of Free Grace, and thought to be juſtified by the Merit of their Obedience to it.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Perverſe Engagement againſt one anothers Opinions, as dangerous, hath made <hi>Paul</hi>'s Doctrine of Faith and Juſtification ſeem much more difficult than it is. 1. It is certain, That by [<hi>Faith</hi>] he meaneth no one ſingle Act onely, as is [The believing that Chriſt's Righteouſneſs is imputed to us], as if we were not juſtified by believing in God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or the Holy Ghoſt, or truſting the Promiſe of Glory, or believing that Chriſt died for our Sins, roſe, aſcended, intercedeth, reigneth, and will judge us, and glorifie us, or by conſenting to his Covenant of Grace, accepting offered Mercy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Faith is a Moral act, containing many Phyſical acts of Underſtanding and Will; like a Covenant-conſent to a King, a Husband, a Phyſician, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is all that is eſſentially required in Baptiſm, to the Collation of the Grace there given. It is Chriſtianity in conſent.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This Faith is commanded by God, and Grace and Glory promiſed to them that by believing obey this Command; which maketh it the Condition, or Moral receptive Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication for this Gift. And though God's Grace cauſe Men to believe, yet the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and Conditional Promiſe are the Means by which God worketh this Effect. And that
<pb facs="tcp:66325:148"/>
the <hi>Promiſe</hi> be <hi>Conditional,</hi> joyned with <hi>threatning</hi> to Diſobedience, is no more needleſs than the <hi>Command</hi> or <hi>Preaching</hi> is.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Hence Men may claim <hi>Pardon</hi> upon <hi>believing</hi>; but none can claim <hi>Faith</hi> by vertue of any abſolute Promiſe of God, before he have it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Though no Creature can <hi>merit</hi> of God in <hi>Commutative Juſtice,</hi> as giving him a Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, yet they may merit of him as in <hi>Governing Juſtice,</hi> or <hi>Diſtributive</hi>: But this is vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, as the Governing Law is.</p>
            <p>According to the Law of <hi>Innocency</hi> no man meriteth; nor Juſtification according to the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi>; ſave Chriſt alone. Chriſt's Merit was in the fulfilling the undertaken Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatorſhip, which was fulfilling the Law of Innocency, (which he onely was capable of) and <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law, and the peculiar Acts of a Mediator: This Merit of Chriſt is the valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, procuring, meritorious Cauſe of all our Deliverance, (Pardon, Juſtification, Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) of which our own Habits or Acts are no Parts, nor are at all to be judged to be in ſtead of any part of the Office of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="5">5. But we are not <hi>Lawleſs,</hi> but under a <hi>Pardoning</hi> and <hi>Juſtifying Law,</hi> or <hi>Covenant</hi> of <hi>Grace,</hi> which giveth Grace and Glory (as is ſaid) to them that believe and repent; that is, pardoneth them, and giveth them the in-dwelling Spirit of Love, and right to Life, if they ſincerely truſt Chriſt's Mediation and Promiſe for it, and give up themſelves for that end to God their reconciled Father, to Chriſt as their Saviour, and his Spirit as their Sanctifier.</p>
            <p>And becauſe God will not give us the free Gift of Chriſt, and Life with him, but as firſt qualified by this Condition of Faith, therefore Faith is ſaid to be imputed to us for Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs: that is, This Acceptance of his free Gift in Chriſt, is all that the Law of Grace, by which we ſhall be judged, requireth of us that we may be accounted Righteous, without Innocency, or the Works of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law, or any that make not the gift of Pardon and Life to be of free Grace. To have <hi>Righteouſneſs imputed,</hi> is to be <hi>accounted Righteous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. To call Faith a <hi>Juſtifying Inſtrument,</hi> is an unapt Speech of Mans vain invention; but may be tolerated, if they mean but [<hi>A Moral receptive Diſpoſition],</hi> unfitly called <hi>A recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Inſtrument:</hi> But not in proper ſenſe.</p>
            <p n="7">7. But though Chriſt is our Surety and <hi>Vicarius poenae</hi> in ſome ſenſe, and properly a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for our Sin, and merited all that we have by his Righteouſneſs; yet it ſubverteth the Goſpel and Chriſtianity, to teach, as ſome do, That Chriſt did ſo properly perſonate every one of the Elect, that in the ſenſe of God and the Law (though not Phyſically) they all perfectly fulfilled the Law of Innocency in and by him, and ſo are juſtified by that Law, as imputatively being ſinleſs: As if that Law had ſaid, [<hi>Thou or thy Surety ſhall die if thou ſin</hi>] and we are juſtified by the ſame Law that condemned us; and no Death, or Suffering, or permitted Sin were any Penalties on us: And as if we were at once reputed ſinleſs from Birth to Death, and yet muſt have a Chriſt to die for our Sin, and muſt daily beg forgiveneſs of it.</p>

               <p rend="small">25.

               <p n="3">3. For what if ſome did not believe? ſhall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect?</p>
               <p rend="small">3. It's true, that the moſt of the preſent <hi>Jews</hi> do not believe in Chriſt, nor yield to the perſwaſions of the Goſpel. But ſtill Gods Word is ſure and true, and his Fidelity will perform all his Promiſes.</p>

               <p rend="small">4. Far be it from us to think that God is untruſty, or can lie: All Men are untruſty, and may deceive by lies; but God's Fidelity is his Perfection, which cannot fall.

               <p rend="small">6. Far be it from us ſo to think: For ſure the Judge of all the World is Righteous, and will righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly judge.</p>
               <p n="7">7. For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie unto his glory, why alſo am I yet judged a ſinner? 8. And not rather (as we be ſlanderouſly reported, and as ſome affirm that we ſay) Let us do evil that good may come: whoſe damnation is juſt.</p>

But juſt is the damnation of ſuch that pretend Gods Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to embolden them in Sin.</p>

No, in no wiſe: For we have before pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> are all under the guilt and reign of Sin, till Grace recover them.</p>
               <p n="10">10. As it is written, there is none righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, no not one. 11.

They are turned from the way of truth and obedience, and happineſs: They are all but hurtful, or unprofitable in the World, and none of them that ſet themſelves to a Life that may do good to themſelves or others, or to pleaſe God. They are ſo like Satan, who ſeeketh whom he may devour, that their Throat is like an open Sepulchre, greedily gaping to devour the Juſt and Godly; their Tongues ſerve the Father of lies, in ſlandering Gods Truth, and Servants; and their Words are like Adders Poyſon, that tends to do miſchief, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the good and innocent.

Nature and Cuſtom may teach them to talk for Peace, and Unity, and Love: But they do not, and will not know the true Nature of them, or the way by which they muſt be attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. For they are not governed by the Law and Fear of God, but by their Carnal deceived Wit, and Worldly Intereſt, which God condemneth.</p>
               <p n="19">19. Now we know, that what things ſoever the Law ſaith, it ſaith to them who are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the law, that every mouth may be ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, and all the world may become guilty before God.</p>
               <p rend="small">
                  <pb facs="tcp:66325:151"/>19. All this is written in the <hi>Jews</hi> Law, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is ſpoken to and of the <hi>Jews</hi> as well as others; for the Law ſpeaketh to none but thoſe that are Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and obliged by it: So that neither <hi>Jew</hi> nor <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile</hi> can be juſtified as innocent; but all ſuch ſelf-juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiers will be confuted, and all the World proved guilty of Sin and Puniſhment before God when he ſhall judge them.</p>
               <p n="20">20. Therefore by the deeds of the law there ſhall no fleſh be juſtified in his ſight, for by the law is the knowledge of ſin.</p>

By all this therefore it is clear, that ſeeing all that are under <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law are Sinners againſt the Law, and none are innocent, no Fleſh ſhall be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in Gods ſight by that Law: For as they are Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, ſo it is the Law which notifieth their Sin, and condemneth them for it.</p>

               <p n="1">1. WHat ſhall we ſay then, that Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham our Father, as pertaining to the fleſh hath found?</p>
               <p rend="small">1. Let us conſider <hi>Abraham</hi>'s caſe, the Father of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> according to the Fleſh. For ſure his Prerogative muſt be as great as theirs that claim it as his fleſhly Seed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For if Abraham were juſtified by works, he hath whereof to glory; but not before God.</p>
               <p rend="small">2. If <hi>Abraham</hi> was juſtified by the merit of his Righteouſneſs, as having never deſerved death by Sin, then he may boaſt that Life and Impunity was his due on that account, though yet even that did not merit by any benefit to God. (Or, but towards God he could have no matter to boaſt of, as his own.)</p>
               <p n="3">3. For what ſaith the Scripture? Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham believed God, and it was counted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>him for righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p rend="small">3. For what account doth the Scripture give us of his Righteouſneſs? <hi>Abraham</hi> believed God, (<hi>viz.</hi> That he would perform his free Promiſe of Grace and Peculiarity made to him and his Seed, and all Nations of the Earth in him) and it was counted to him for Righteouſneſs. And though God made his Promiſes to him alſo for his obedience, <hi>Becauſe he ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not his only Son</hi>; yet this was not becauſe he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver deſerved death by any Sin, but as it was a work of Faith, and ſo a conſequent part of the Righteouſneſs of a Believer, accepted, though imperfect, through the Merits and Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, forgiving his Sin, and freely adopting him an Heir of Life.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Now to him that worketh, is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward not reckoned of grace, but of debt.</p>
               <p rend="small">4. Now to him that meriteth by the perfection of his Obedience, or that never deſerved death by Sin; (much more to him that benefiteth another by his Work) the Reward is not reckoned to be the free gift of a Benefactor, but the juſt giving a Man that which is his deſerved due (in the firſt caſe by governing Juſtice, and in the ſecond by Commuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Juſtice.)</p>
               <p n="5">5. But to him that worketh not, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth on him that juſtifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p rend="small">5. But to him that hath no ſuch meritorious work for the value of which the Reward ſhould be his due, but truſteth wholly to his free Grace, who firſt <hi>maketh</hi> and then <hi>judgeth</hi> them <hi>juſt</hi> that were <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ungodly</hi> and unjuſt, (or, who juſtifieth them that by Sin have deſerved death, and never merited life by the worth of their good Works) his Faith is coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for Righteouſneſs, by the Covenant of Grace; that is, God accepteth it as the qualification or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, which muſt be found in him, (without ſuch meritorious Works) to make him partaker of that Pardon, Adoption, and Salvation freely given by Grace, upon the conſideration of the meritorious Righteouſneſs of Chriſt. (Indeed Faith, Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, Prayer, Confeſſion, Love, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are Acts that may be called <hi>Works</hi> in another ſenſe: But it is Works deſerving life for their perfection, or not deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving puniſhment by the Law, which are here ſpoken of.)</p>
               <p n="6">6. Even as David alſo deſcribeth the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs of the man, unto whom God im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puteth righteouſneſs without works, 7. Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Bleſſed are they whoſe iniquities are forgiven, and whoſe ſins are covered, 8. Bleſſed is the man to whom the Lord im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puteth not ſin.</p>
               <p rend="small">6, 7, 8. So <hi>David</hi> alſo deſcribeth the qualification of a Bleſſed Man (which is a man juſtified) Not that he hath no Sin, which deſerved death, but that God doth not impute his Sin to him for his condemnation, but forgiveth and covereth it, and imputeth Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs to him, that is, judgeth and uſeth him as one that is not obliged to puniſhment, but hath right to Salvation, and this, not becauſe his Works deſerved not Death but Life; but becauſe he forgiveth him, and freely ſaveth him for Righteouſneſs and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion of Chriſt; and uſeth him not as he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Cometh this bleſſedneſs then on the circumciſion only, or on the uncircumciſion alſo? For we ſay that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p rend="small">9. And are none pardoned and ſaved but the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed? Are not the Uncircumciſed pardoned and bleſſed alſo? If Faith was imputed for Righteouſneſs to <hi>Abraham,</hi> will it not be ſo to all that have it?</p>
               <p n="10">10. How was it then reckoned? When he was in circumciſion or in uncircumciſion? Not in circumciſion, but in uncircumciſion.</p>
               <p rend="small">10. And the time when this was ſaid of <hi>Abraham</hi> will clear up all this; for it was not after he was Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed, but before; even Uncircumciſed, as the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile</hi> Chriſtians be.</p>
               <p n="11">11. And he received the ſign of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, a ſeal of the righteouſneſs of the

faith, which he had yet being uncircumciſed; that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumciſed, that righteouſneſs might be imputed to them alſo.</p>
               <p rend="small">11. And he after received the Sign of Crcumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, not as a Legally juſtifying Sign, but as a Seal of that Righteouſneſs which God before imputed to him as a Believer; that ſo he might be by Promiſe and Example, the Father, not only of his Carnal and Circumciſed Seed, but of all them that believe, though out the World, that ſo Righteouſneſs might be imputed to them as Believers, as it was to him.</p>
               <p n="12">12. And the father of circumciſion to them who are not of the circumciſion only, but alſo (to them that) walk in the ſteps of that faith of our father Abraham, which he had being yet uncircumciſed.</p>
               <p rend="small">12. And might be the Father of the Ends, and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual benefits of Circumciſion, conveyed to them who are not of the Circumciſion only, but alſo to them that walk in the ſteps of that Faith of our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Abraham, which he had being yet Uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, as they are.</p>
               <p n="13">13. For the promiſe that he ſhould be the heir of the world, was not to Abraham and his ſeed through the Law, but through the righteouſneſs of faith.</p>
               <p rend="small">13. For the Promiſe to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed, That he ſhould be Heir of the World, was not made to him by the Law, which was long af<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>er, nor for the keeping of it; but upon his believing Gods merciful Promiſe, and truſting him, for which he was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted and pronounced Righteous.</p>
               <p n="14">14. For if they which are of the law be heirs, faith is made void, and the promiſe made of none effect.</p>
               <p rend="small">14. For if this great Promiſe of Inheritance was made to Men for keeping <hi>Miſes</hi>'s Law, as ſuch, (and ſo only to them) then it was null to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and it is of no effect to any.</p>
               <p n="15">15. Becsuſe the law worketh wrath; for where no law is, there is no tranſgreſſion.</p>
               <p rend="small">15. Becauſe, as the Law is made to forbid and condemn Sin, ſo it obligeth Sinners to undergo the Puniſhment; which were no obligation, were there no obliging Law: And <hi>Abraham</hi> was not under <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law, and ſo tranſgreſſed it not.</p>
               <p n="16">16. Therefore it is of faith that it might be by grace, to the end the promiſe might be ſure to all the ſeed, not to that only which is of the law, but to that alſo which is of the ſaith of Abraham, who is the father of us all.</p>
               <p rend="small">16. Therefore this great Promiſe and Bleſſing is made to Believers, as ſuch, that it may be free, and of meer Grace, that ſo it may be ſure and firm to all the Seed or Children of Promiſe; not only to the <hi>Jews</hi> that had the Law, and were the Natural Seed, but to the <hi>Gentiles</hi> alſo, who have <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Faith, and ſo are his Spiritual Seed, who is the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of all Believers.</p>
               <p n="17">17. (As it is written [I have made thee a father of many nations]) before him whom he believed, even God who quickeneth the dead, and calleth thoſe things which be not as though they were.</p>
               <p rend="small">17. As it is written, I have made thee a Father of many Nations, and not of the <hi>Iſraelitiſh</hi> Nation only: So that though the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were not then called, as now they are, by the Goſpel, yet that God who promiſed this to <hi>Abraham,</hi> when his Body and <hi>Sarah</hi>'s were naturally paſt Generation, and to <hi>Iſaac</hi> when he was unborn; and again, when God demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him as an Offering, and thence, as it were, raiſed him from the dead; that God, I ſay, did decree the calling of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and ſpake of that in Promiſe which was long after to be done.</p>
               <p n="18">18. Who againſt hope believed in hope, that he might become the father of many nations, according to that which was ſpoken [So ſhall thy ſeed be.]</p>
               <p rend="small">18. This was the meaning of Gods Promiſe to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> who againſt all natural probability, truſted Gods Promiſe, and believed and hoped that accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly he ſhould become the Father of many Nations: And that, as was promiſed, his Seed ſhould be as the Stars in Heaven.</p>
               <p n="19">19. And being not weak in faith, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered not his own body now dead, when he was an hundred years old, nor yet the deadneſs of Sarah's womb.</p>
               <p rend="small">19. And his Faith was not weak and ſhaken with the conſideration that his aged Body was almoſt dead, and unfit for procreation, or that <hi>Sarah</hi>'s Womb was ſo alſo.</p>
               <p n="20">20. He ſtaggered not at the promiſe of God through unbelief; but was ſtrong in ſaith, giving glory to God. 21. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fully perſwaded, that what he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed he was able to perform.</p>

               <p n="22">22. And therefore it was imputed to him for righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p rend="small">22. And therefore this way of glorifying God by the truſting belief of his free Promiſe, was ſo ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Gods Ends and Honour, that he accepted it as Righteouſneſs, or a ſufficient qualification of him

that ſhould partake of his free given Mercy, though <hi>Abraham</hi> had no ſinleſs innocency, nor could ſay that he never deſerved death.</p>

               <p n="3">3. And not onely ſo, but we glory in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations alſo, knowing that tribulation worketh patience, 4. And patience expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, and experience hope, 5. And hope maketh not aſhamed; becauſe the love of God is ſhed abroad on our hearts by the holy Ghoſt which is given unto us.</p>
               <p rend="small">3, 4, 5. Yea, more than ſo, but alſo in all our tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations which we undergo in the World for Chriſt and Righteouſneſs, we exult with glorying and joy; knowing that this tribulation doth by exerciſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe our Patience, and being tryed, our patient and conſtant ſuffering maketh us the more certain by experience that our Faith is ſound, and giveth us experience of Gods ſupporting Grace. And this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience much confirmeth our hope of Gods accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and our Salvation, which we ſhould be apt to doubt of, if our Faith and Gods Grace had not been thus tryed; it being eaſie by ſelf-flattery to think untry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Faith is better than it is. And this confirmed hope will never leave us to ſhame by diſappointment, for it is accompanied and ſealed by that ſpecial gift of the Holy Ghoſt, which ſheddeth abroad on our Hearts the effects and ſenſe of the Love of God through Chriſt, and ſo repleniſheth us with Reflecting-love to God, (even as the Summer Rains and Sunſhine moiſten and warm the Earth, and repleniſh it with pleaſant Fruits.)</p>
               <p n="6">6. For when we were yet without ſtrength, in due time Chriſt died for the ungodly.</p>
               <p rend="small">6. For when we were worthleſs, helpleſs, loſt and miſerable, in the fitteſt ſeaſon Chriſt died even for the ungodly guilty Sinners; to recover them to God, and ſave them.</p>
               <p n="7">7. For ſcarcely for a righteous man will one die; yet peradventure for a good man ſome would even dare to die.</p>
               <p rend="small">7. For among Men, few (or ſcarce any one) would die for an Innocent Man; though perhaps ſome few of rare Charity and ſelf-denial, would venture on death for a Man of eminent worth and goodneſs.</p>
               <p n="8">8. But God commendeth his love toward us, in that while we were yet ſinners Chriſt died for us.</p>
               <p rend="small">8. But the love of God to us was ſo tranſcendent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declared and magnified, that while we were yet Sinners againſt his Law and him, Chriſt died to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile and ſave us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Much more then being now juſtified by his blood, we ſhall be ſaved from wrath through him.</p>

And if he loved us ſo far, as to give his Son to die for us when we were meer guilty Sinners, we may be ſure that now he hath <hi>made</hi> and <hi>accepted</hi> us as Righteous, pardoning all our Sin for the Sacrifice of the Blood of Chriſt, he will certainly ſave us from Damnation.</p>
               <p n="10">10. For if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God, by the death of his Son, much more being reconciled we ſhall be ſaved by his life.</p>
               <p rend="small">10. For if God reconciled us to himſelf by his Sons death, when we were his Enemies, doubtleſs he will

ſave them that are now reconciled, and pardoned Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, by the Interceſſion of him that liveth in Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and is now our Head, the Lord of Life, by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving us his Spirit, and juſtifying us at laſt, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving us to himſelf in Glory. He that loved his Enemies, will not damn his beloved Children.</p>
               <p n="11">11. And not only ſo, but we alſo joy in God, through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by whom we have received the atonement.</p>
               <p rend="small">11. And now moreover, through this reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by Chriſt, which we have received upon our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, God is ſo far from being our terrifying, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venging Judge, that he is become our greateſt glorying and joy; he being our God and we his People, and he being our Father, and alſufficient Portion and Felicity.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Wherefore as by one man ſin entred into the world, and death by ſin, and ſo death paſſed upon all men, for that all have ſinned.</p>
               <p rend="small">12. In all this we have notice of this great Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that as <hi>Adam</hi> was the Root, or firſt cauſe of Mans Sin and Death, and by that one Man ſin entred into the World, and death by Sin, and ſo all being Sinners, death paſſed upon all, even Temporal death actually and Eternal death by the Sentence of the Violated Law, as being our due.</p>
               <p n="13">13. For until the law ſin was in the world; but ſin is not imputed where there is no law. 14. Nevertheleſs death reigned from Adam to Moſes, even over them that had not ſinned after the ſimilitude of Adams tranſgreſſion, who is the figure of him that was to come.</p>
               <p rend="small">13, 14. For it is certain that Sin was in the World before <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law, even from <hi>Adam</hi>'s fall: And whereas that is no Sin, nor imputed to Guilt and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, which is againſt no Law; yet death reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from <hi>Adam</hi>'s fall till <hi>Moſes</hi>; and therefore all were under ſome Law, Sin being ſo far imputed to them; though they ſinned not themſelves as <hi>Adam</hi> did, againſt an expreſs particular command and penal threatning by ſupernatural Revelation from Heaven, nor all that died (<hi>e. g.</hi> Infants) did actually and perſonally tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs: Therefore it was from him, as his vitiated guilty Seed, that they derived Original Sin, and by this vitious nature they at age ſinned actually, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that Law which they were under, and by both were the Children of death; ſo that we may compare <hi>Adam</hi> as the root of Sin and Death to all, with Chriſt who is to all true Chriſtians the root of Holineſs and Life.</p>
               <p n="15">15. But not as the offence, ſo alſo is the free gift. For if through the offence of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man Jeſus Chriſt, hath abounded unto many.</p>
               <p rend="small">15. But the diſparity muſt be noted: For if the ſin of one Man had ſuch malignant power and perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious efficacy as to procure the guilt and death of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, we may be ſure that the Grace and Mercy of God, and the gift of that ſaving Grace which is from the Merits, Interceſſion and Spirit of Chriſt, ſhall be more effectual to the Life of many.</p>
               <p n="16">16. And not as it was by one that ſinned, ſo is the gift: for the judgment was by one to condemnation, but the free gift is of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny offences unto juſtification.</p>
               <p rend="small">16. And there is this further differences, that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> one Man by one ſin, brought the Sentence of Death on all the World, which had not paſſed elſe upon us. But it is many Sins, of many Men, which Chriſt doth deliver us from in the free gift of our Juſtification.</p>
               <p n="17">17. For if by one mans offence death reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by one, much more they which receive abundance of grace, and of the gift of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, ſhall reign in life by one Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p rend="small">17. For if one offence of one Man made all Men Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to Death by that one; much more powerfully and effectually, they which receive from one Redeemer abundance of Grace, and the gift of Righteouſneſs, in the healing and pardoning of all their Sins, ſhall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly Reign in the purchaſed and promiſed life of Glory, by that one Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="18">18. Therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, even ſo by the righteouſneſs of one the free gift came upon all men to juſtification of life.</p>
               <p rend="small">18. Therefore, as by the offence of one the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of Death was paſſed upon all his poſterity; ſo alſo by the Righteouſneſs of one, as the merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and procuring cauſe, the free gift came on all Men, for Juſtification and Life. That is, A free Gift is made and offered promiſcuouſly to all, on condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of believing, ſuitable acceptance, and actually juſtifieth all to Life, who ſo believingly accept it, and unthankfully reject it not.</p>
               <p n="19">19. For as by one mans diſobedience ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny were made ſinners, ſo by the obedience of one ſhall many be made righteous.</p>
               <p rend="small">19. For as by one, <hi>Adam</hi>'s diſobedience, all Men, as receiving their Nature from him, are made guilty and corrupt, and puniſhable as Sinners, ſo by the procuring meritorious Obedience of one (in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming all that was required of him as our Redeemer, in perfect holineſs of Soul and Life, fulfilling the Law of Innocency, and of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the peculiar Law of Mediation, being obedient to the Death on the Croſs) ſhall the many that by Faith receive him, be <hi>conſtituted Righteous,</hi> and ſo <hi>accounted</hi> and <hi>judged</hi> of God, even reconciled, pardoned, adopted, and made the Heirs of Life.</p>
               <p n="20">20. Moreover the law entred, that the
<pb facs="tcp:66325:154"/>
offence might abound: but where ſin abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, grace did much more abound.</p>
               <p rend="small">20. And <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law, which came in afterward, was made to increaſe Mens obligation againſt Sin, and more expreſly and terribly forbid it, that if the <hi>Jews</hi> would ſin, their Guilt and Puniſhment ſhould be the greater (as alas, they did even to abundance:) But when guilt was increaſed (and Sin by Mens abuſe of the Law), Grace did ſuperabound, being victorious againſt Sin and Guilt, and the curſe in all true Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and extending to many more than <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law did, even to all the called Nations of the World.</p>
               <p n="21">21. That as ſin hath reigned unto death, even ſo might grace reign through righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs to eternal life, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>
               <p rend="small">21. That as Sin hath had its reign and ſad effects in the Death and Miſeries of the Sons of <hi>Adam,</hi> even ſo ſhall Grace have its more victorious Dominion, and Reign by the Meritorious Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, in making all his Members or Spiritual.

               <p n="1">1. WHat ſhall we ſay then? ſhall we continue in ſin that grace may abound?</p>
               <p rend="small">1. Perhaps ſome may gather from all this, that we preach a Doctrine of Licentiouſneſs; and ſeeing Grace abounded, where Sin abounded; we infer that Men may continue in Sin that Grace may abound.</p>
               <p n="2">2. God forbid. How ſhall we that are dead to ſin live any longer therein?</p>
               <p rend="small">2. Far be it from us ſo to think: For though Chriſt came to ſave Sinners, it was not to ſavour Sin, but to deſtroy it, and ſave Men from it. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as he died for Sin, he cauſeth us to die to Sin; and how then ſhall we live in it that are dead to it?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Know ye not, that ſo many of us as were baptized into Jeſus Chriſt, were bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed into his death?</p>
               <p rend="small">3. Know ye not, that when Men are Baptized, they are by Vow, Covenant, and Profeſſion liſted into the belief of a Crucified Saviour, who died for Sin to ſave us from it, and do profeſs that Repentance by which we renounce it, as dead to it for the time to come?</p>
               <p n="4">4. Therefore we are buried with him by baptiſm into his death, that like as Chriſt was raiſed up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even ſo we alſo ſhould walk in newneſs of life.</p>
               <p rend="small">4. Therefore in our Baptiſm we are dipped unde the Water, as ſignifying our Covenant-profeſſion, that as he was buried for Sin, we are dead and buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Sin, that as the glorious power of God raiſed him from the dead, ſo we ſhould riſe up to live to him in newneſs and holineſs of Life.</p>
               <p n="5">5. For if we have been planted together in the likeneſs of his death, we ſhall be alſo in the likeneſs of his reſurrection.</p>
               <p rend="small">5. For as we have Covenanted and Profeſſed our belief in him and conformity to him as Dead, ſo we have Covenanted and Profeſſed, and muſt practiſe our Conformity to his Reſurrection, or elſe it is not true Baptiſm, and Chriſtianity, and Conformity to Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of ſin might be deſtroyed, that henceforth we ſhould not ſerve ſin.</p>
               <p rend="small">6. Knowing that as his Body was Crucified for Sin, ſo we have herein Covenanted and Profeſſed to be, as to our old Diſpoſitions and ſinful Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as it were crucified with him, that the Body of Sin, that is, our fleſhly corrupt diſpoſition and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, might be deſtroyed, that henceforth we ſhould not ſerve Sin, but be as dead to it.</p>
               <p n="7">7. For he that is dead, is freed from ſin.</p>
               <p rend="small">7. For as a Dead Man is abſolved from all ſervile Obligations to his Maſter, ſo he that is by the Death of Sin conformed to the death of Chriſt, is freed from the dominion of Sin.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Now if we be dead with Chriſt, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that we ſhall alſo live with him.</p>
               <p rend="small">8. And if we be indeed what we are by Baptiſmal Profeſſion, conformed thus to Chriſts Death, we have cauſe to believe that we muſt and ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to his Reſurrection and Life.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Knowing that Chriſt being raiſed from the dead, dieth no more, death hath no more dominion over him. 10. For in that he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he died unto ſin once; but in that he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth, he liveth unto God. 11. Likewiſe reckon ye alſo your ſelves to be dead indeed unto ſin, but alive unto God, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>
               <p rend="small">9, 10, 11. For as we know that Chriſt being raiſed from the Dead, dieth no more. His Death for Sin was but once, but he being riſen liveth to God for ever; ſo muſt you reckon that you are by Converſion from Sin to God, once dead to Sin by Covenant, Conſent, and Profeſſion, that you may ever after-live to God, by the Mediation, Spirit, and Grace of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Let not ſin reign therefore in your mortal body, that you ſhould obey it in the luſts thereof.</p>
               <p rend="small">Therefore, unleſs you will renounce your Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm and Chriſtianity, you muſt not let Sin reign

in thoſe bodies which as they die for ſin, ſo are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſedly dead to ſin: Its luſts may tempt and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble you, but muſt not be obeyed.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Neither yield ye your members as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of unrighteouſneſs unto ſin; but yield your ſelves to God, as thoſe that are alive from the dead, and your members as inſtruments of righteouſneſs to God.</p>
               <p rend="small">13. Nor muſt you yield the Members of your Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, as inſtruments of unrighteouſneſs unto ſin, tho you ſhould pretend that you keep your Hearts clean to God; but give up your ſelves to the Government and Will of God, as thoſe that are riſen and alive from your dead ſtate of ſin, that you may live to him, and ſo give up the Members of your Bodies as the Souls Inſtruments of Righteouſneſs in ſerving God.</p>
               <p n="14">14. For ſin ſhall not have dominion over you: for you are not under the law, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der grace.</p>
               <p rend="small">14. For ſin muſt not, and ſhall not have domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on over you, to rule you or condemn you; for you are not under the Law which meerly forbade it, and condemned the ſinner, but under Grace which mortifieth and forgiveth it.</p>
               <p n="15">15. What then? ſhall we ſin becauſe we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid.</p>
               <p rend="small">15. What then? ſhall we turn this Argument of our deliverance from ſin to encourage us in ſin, and be the bolder to ſin, becauſe we are not under the Law that condemneth ſinners, but under Grace that pardoneth them. Far be it from us.</p>
               <p n="16">16. Know ye not, that to whom ye yield your ſelves ſervants to obey, his ſervants you are to whom ye obey, whether of ſin unto death, or of obedience unto righteouſneſs?</p>
               <p rend="small">16. Know ye not, that as your engagement to be Servants of Chriſt bindeth you to obey him; ſo your obedience will ſhew whoſe Servants you are indeed; whether you obey ſin, which is the way of death, or obey Chriſt unto Righteouſneſs and life.</p>
               <p n="17">17. But God be thanked that ye were the ſervants of ſin, but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to you.</p>
               <p rend="small">17. But God be thanked for your change and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance; that though you were formerly the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of ſin, you have obeyed, not only Bodily, but from the Heart, that form of Chriſtian Doctrine which was delivered to you, and to which you did conſent.</p>
               <p n="18">18. Being then made free from ſin, you became the ſervants of righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p rend="small">18. In your Converſion and Baptiſm you being delivered from the ſervitude and guilt of ſin, you then by conſent and Covenant became Chriſts Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants for the way and works of Righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p n="19">19. I ſpeak after the manner of men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the infirmity of your fleſh. For as you have yielded your members ſervants to uncleanneſs and to iniquity, unto iniquity; even ſo now yield your membes ſervants to righteouſneſs, unto holineſs.</p>
               <p rend="small">19. I uſe this familiar ſpeech by ſimilitude and allegory, as fitted to your Capacity: As you did formerly uſe your Bodies in uncleanneſs and iniquity, as Servants of iniquity; ſo now uſe your Bodies as Servants of Righteouſneſs, devoted to God, and ſanctified to obey him,</p>
               <p n="20">20. For when ye were the Servants of ſin, ye were free from righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p rend="small">20. For when you lived in the ſervitude of ſin, you were not the Servants of God and Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, you lived not a life of Holineſs and obedience to God.</p>
               <p n="21">21. What fruit had you then in thoſe things whereof you are now aſhamed? For the end of thoſe things is death.</p>
               <p rend="small">21. Review now thoſe works, and think what you got by them, you are juſtly now aſhamed of them and of their fruits: For whatever ſin ſeem in the committing, miſery and death is the end and fruit of it, where Grace doth not recover and forgive.</p>
               <p n="22">22. But now being made free from ſin, and become ſervants to God, ye have your fruit unto holineſs, and the end everlaſting life.</p>

               <p n="1">1. KNow ye not, brethren, (for I ſpeak to them that know the law) that the
<pb facs="tcp:66325:155"/>
law hath power over a man as long as he liveth?</p>
               <p rend="small">1. I have uſed the ſimilitudes of a dead Man, and one raiſed from death, and of a Servant, and one ſet free and under another Maſter; I will now add the ſimilitude of a married Woman and a dead Husband. You know (who know the Law) that the Law of Superiority, which giveth one power over another, obligeth only untill death.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband ſo long as he liveth: But if the husband be dead, ſhe is looſed from the law of the husband.</p>
               <p rend="small">2. The Law bindeth a Wife to be a Subject to her Husband till he die; but then ſhe is thereby no longer bound to him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. So then, if while her husband liveth ſhe be married to another man, ſhe ſhall be called an adultereſs: But if her husband be dead, ſhe is free from that law, ſo that ſhe is no adultereſs, though ſhe be married to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man.</p>
               <p rend="small">3. So that though ſhe be an Adultereſs who mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth another, while her Husband liveth, yet when her Husband is dead, ſhe is free from that obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and is no Adultereſs for marrying with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Wherefore, my brethren, ye alſo are become dead to the law by the body of Chriſt, that ye ſhould be married to another; even to him who is raiſed from the dead, that we ſhould bring forth fruit unto God.</p>
               <p rend="small">4. So death hath ſeparated the Law and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving <hi>Jews.</hi> The Law being abrogated by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Death, and Grace of Chriſt, is dead to you, as you by Faith and Baptiſm are dead to it; that ſo you ſhould be married to him that cauſed this by his death, and is raiſed from the dead, and hath raiſed you from the death of ſin and guilt, and legal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation to a new and holy life, that regeneration may cauſe you to generate the holy fruit of Love and good Works, and live hereafter unto God.</p>
               <p n="5">5. For when we were in the fleſh, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of ſin which were by the law did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death.</p>
               <p rend="small">5. For when we were in our meer corrupted Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and only under a forbidding and condemning Law, without the Goſpel and its Grace, the Law did but irritate and ſhew our Carnal Luſts, and cauſe our Guilt and Condemnation, and did not either heal or pardon us.</p>
               <p n="6">6. But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held, that we ſhould ſerve in newneſs of ſpirit and not in the oldneſs of the letter.</p>
               <p rend="small">6. But now we are delivered from that Law, and ſo from its manifold difficult impoſitions, all which we could not fulfil, and alſo from its curſe of thoſe that fulfil it not: For it is aboliſhed, and bindeth us no more: That now we may ſerve God with New Hearts, and lives, by the Spirit of Chriſt, according to the Law of Grace, and not Carnally in the bondage and terror of the old Law.</p>
               <p n="7">7. What ſhall we ſay then? Is the law ſin? God forbid. Nay, I had not known ſin, but by the law. For I had not known luſt, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the law had ſaid, Thou ſhalt not covet.</p>
               <p rend="small">7. But think not by this that we infer, that the Law is bad or culpable, or the cauſe of ſin: Far be it from us; ſo far am I from ſuch a thought, that I teſtifie that the Law is the forbidder, and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer and condemner of ſin: For I had not known my Hearts inordinate deſires or luſts to be ſo bad, if the Law had not ſaid. Thou ſhalt not covet: For corrupt Nature hardly diſcerneth the evil of its own inclination, ſo be it, it break not out into Act, but is ready to think it is blameleſs becauſe its Natural.</p>
               <p n="8">8. But ſin taking occaſion by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, wrought in me all manner of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence: For without the law ſin was dead.</p>
               <p rend="small">8. But my own Soul hath ſinful inclinations and imperfections; by original corruption and the evil habits increaſed by actual ſin: And by theſe I am ſo backward to good and prone to evil, that a Law of ſuch a multitude of difficult, poſitive, Precepts and Prohibitions, making me ſo much work, and ſo hard, is become morally impoſſible for me perfectly to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil: Had I been only under the Law made to faln <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Noah,</hi> and all Mankind, a great number of Legal Poſitives and Ceremonials had never obliged me; but this Law, being made, and all theſe things laid upon me which my corrupt Nature could not fulfil, preſently my badneſs and diſability appeared in a great number of Acts, which now became forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den ſin, and in the omiſſion of things commanded<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> even as if you command ignorant, weak, and il-diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Men, a multitude of ſuch particulars as none but the wiſe and well diſpoſed will keep, it will oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion them to be guilty of a multitude of ſins, which without thoſe Canons or Laws would have been no ſin, ſo my ſinful Nature made this Law of Works, an occaſion of my guilt of a multitude of actual ſins; which without the Law would have been no ſin, or not ſo culpable. Beſides that the prohibition ſtirred up my ill inclination, and alſo that I ſinned againſt more knowledge.</p>
               <p n="9">9. For I was alive without the law once; but when the commandment came, ſin revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and I died.</p>
               <p rend="small">9. For if you ſuppoſe me only under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law made to <hi>Noah</hi> and all Mankind, and the Promiſe made to him and to <hi>Abraham,</hi> before the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> was made, I had not then been under
<pb facs="tcp:66325:155"/>
either that Sentence of a Temporal or an Eternal death, which by <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law are the wages of many ſins, not before forbidden: But when I am under all thoſe Laws which curſe or cut off all that do not the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous Tasks and Ceremonies there impoſed, I am then become a dead Man in Law, and the Law and ſin riſe up in power againſt me, and condemn me.</p>
               <p n="10">10. And the commandment which was ordained unto life, I found to be unto death.</p>
               <p rend="small">10. And the Commandment which promiſed life to them that keep it, proved the occaſion of death to me.</p>
               <p n="11">11. For ſin taking occaſion by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, deceived me, and by it ſlew me.</p>
               <p rend="small">11. For my ſinful nature called out to ſo much duty, and forbidden ſo many things, being unable to do the duties, and prone to the things forbidden, by occaſion of this Law, became the guilty cauſe of many actual ſins of omiſſion and commiſſion, and as ill humours ſtirred by a purge oft rage the more, ſo did the pravity of my nature, and ſo I was made guilty of death.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and juſt, and good.</p>
               <p rend="small">12. Wherefore I teſtifie that the Law is pure and holy, and juſt, and good: God juſtly made it: His Wiſdom and Holineſs ſhine forth in it: If Men be bad and ill diſpoſed, God may juſtly give them ſuch Laws as their badneſs is averſe to keep. And he had good and gracious ends in giving it: He made it indeed very operous, ſomewhat like the Law of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency to <hi>Adam,</hi> though not that ſame, but yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junct and ſubordinate to the Law and Promiſe of Grace; which the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhould have noted, and uſed it accordingly.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Was that then which is good made death to me? God forbid: But ſin, that it might appear ſin, working death in me by that which is good, that ſin by the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment might become exceeding ſinful.</p>
               <p rend="small">13. What then? Is the Law guilty of my ſin and death? By no means: But the inward pravity of my Soul, which elſe would have been more latent, unknown, and not have brought forth ſo much actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſin and death, did by the good Law of God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in its proper evil nature, and ſhew how preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant it was of actual ſin, and how averſe to full obedience, and ſo by producing theſe actual ſins, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared and became exceeding ſinful.</p>
               <p n="14">14. For we know that the law is ſpiritual; but I am carnal, ſold under ſin.</p>
               <p rend="small">14. For we all confeſs that the Law being Gods own Law, is Divine, Spiritual, and Pure: And the reaſon why I do not fulfil it, and ſo cannot be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by it, is in my ſelf; who in my Corrupt Nature am Carnal, and under a Moral neceſſity of ſinning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it; predominantly before Grace, and in part after.</p>
               <p n="15">15. For that which I do, I allow not: For what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I.</p>
               <p rend="small">15. I may well call it a Captivity, or a kind of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, when my knowledge and unfeigned (though imperfect) willingneſs and deſire, and my hatred of the ſin, yet will not enable me to be ſo free from ſin and fulfil the Law, as to be juſtified by it (much leſs will the uneffectual convictions and wiſhes of the unregenerate do this) For though I do not in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment approve my ſin; and I have a deſire perfectly to fulfill the Law of God, and I would be freed from all ſin; yet I attain not this perfection which I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire.</p>
               <p n="16">16. If then I do that which I would not, I conſent to the law that it is good.</p>
               <p rend="small">16. Now if I did not juſtifie the Law as good, I ſhould not thus condemn my ſelf for breaking it, nor deſire thus perfectly to keep it.</p>
               <p n="17">17. Now then it is no more I that do it, but ſin that dwelleth in me.</p>
               <p rend="small">17. And becauſe the Underſtanding and Will are the higheſt faculties, and a Man is in Gods account what he truly would be, therefore I may ſay, that (though it be my ſin to have ſo inordinate a ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive inclination, and ſo imperfect a Mind and Will which ſhould better rule it,) yet it is not ſuch a ſin as ſheweth the predominant diſpoſition of my Soul, and denominateth the Man, but is contrary to the reſolved bent of my heart and life; and therefore the Lord of Grace will not judge me according to that which is but my imperfection, and which I more hate than love, and would unfeignedly be rid of, for it is no reigning ſin that I confeſs.</p>
               <p n="18">18. For I know, that in me (that is, in my fleſh) dwelleth no good thing: for to will is preſent with me, but how to perform that which is good, I find not.</p>
               <p rend="small">18. For I know that ſo far as I have any corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and carnality, I am prone to evil and not to good! For by the Grace of God I do truly deſire perfection it ſelf; but I am not able to attain my deſire, and to be perfect in my obedience.</p>
               <p n="19">19. For the good which I would, I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do.</p>
               <p rend="small">19. For my Nature being corrupt, and my Will but imperfectly renewed, though ſincere, I cannot be as good as I would be, nor do all the good which I would do, nor avoid all the evil which I would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void, and ſo cannot be ſinleſs and perfectly obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent.</p>
               <p n="20">20. Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but ſin that dwelleth in me.</p>
               <p rend="small">20. Now ſeeing the main bent of my Mind and Will is for perfect obedience, and againſt all ſin, and it is by the inſtigation of the remnant of carnalitie, that I am not ſinleſs and free from all culpable infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
<pb facs="tcp:66325:156"/>
God will not impute that to me which I hate, and is contrary to the bent of my Heart and Life, ſo much as that which I love and live for.</p>
               <p n="21">21. I find then a law, that when I would do good, evil is preſent with me.</p>
               <p rend="small">21. I find then in my Carnal part, an inclination, which is as a contradicting Law, which ſtriveth ſo much againſt the Law of God, that I oft ſin contrary to my predominant Will, and when I would be ſinleſs and perfect, yet I cannot.</p>
               <p n="22">22, 23. For I delight in the law of God after the inward man: But I ſee another law in my members, warring againſt the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of ſin, which is in my members.</p>
               <p rend="small">22, 23. For I delight in the Law of God, after the inward man, which is the bent of my Mind and Will. But my corrupt ſenſual inclination is like a contrary Law, which warreth againſt my Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Will, and like a Captive I am brought by it under a neceſſity of ſinning, ſo far as that my obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is imperfect, and ſo unjuſtifiable by the Law of Works, (as in the unregenerate ſin doth reign.)</p>
               <p n="24">24. O wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from the body of this death.</p>
               <p rend="small">24. So far am I then from being juſtified by this Law, that while it calleth for more perfect obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to its hard and numerous precepts than my ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Soul can perform, and ſo condemneth me, it doth but ſhew me how bad and miſerable I am, and make me cry out, O wretched Man, who ſhall deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver me from this ſinning deadly fleſh?</p>
               <p n="25">25. I thank God, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord. So then, with the mind I my ſelf do ſerve the law of God, but with the fleſh the law of ſin.</p>
               <p rend="small">25. But as I have told you of my miſery by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, under the Law, I will tell you of my remedy: I rejoice in thankfulneſs to God that hath abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Law, and ſanctified my nature by Jeſus Chriſt: And ſo I conclude, that my renewed Mind and Will ſo deſireth perfection, that I would be ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and keep all the Law which God ſhall impoſe and continue; but my fleſhly inclination maketh this ſinleſs perfection too hard for my attainment, and therefore I cannot be juſtified by ſo hard and rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous a Law.</p>

                  <p>THough Expoſitors are much diſagreed whether St. <hi>Paul</hi> here deſcribe a Man Unregenerate under the meer Law, or an Imperfect Man, how ſincere ſoever; yet no ſuch Doctrinal Controverſie dependeth on this Difference, as the Ignorant and Contentious do imagine. For they that think that he deſcribeth the Caſe of a carnal Legalliſt, or Jew, ſuppoſe that he ſpeaketh of their committing againſt knowledge, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual wiſhes, the reigning Sins called Mortal, and live an ungodly Life; and that [<hi>It is not I, but ſin</hi>] ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth onely [My ſuperiour Faculties have ſome uneffectual reluctancy, and are convinced that the Law is good]: And that by [<hi>Captivity to the law of ſin</hi>] is meant a ſlaviſh Life of predominant Senſuality. And doubtleſs ſuch there are, of whom all this is true.</p>
                  <p>And thoſe that think that he ſpeaketh of himſelf even in his Regenerate ſtate, and ſo of all Men, do think that it is not a Life of Wickedneſs, or Mortal Sin, that he deſcribeth, nor a Captivity to it, but una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable Imperfection, called Venial Sin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to the ſame ſenſe as St. <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>If we ſay that we have no ſin, there is no truth in us.</hi> And that [<hi>It is not I, but ſin</hi>] ſignifieth but that a Man ſhall be accounted and judged by God according to what is predominant in his Mind, Will and Life.</p>
                  <p>And I moſt incline to this Expoſition, 1. Becauſe the other ſeemeth forced, which muſt not be received without neceſſity. 2. Becauſe the Apoſtle is not onely proving that the Law will not juſtifie an unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate legal Jew, but that it will juſtifie no Man, how good ſoever. 3. And I do not believe that the unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate can truly ſay as he, [<hi>I delight in the law of God</hi>], and [<hi>to will is preſent with me</hi>], and [<hi>I my ſelf in mind ſerve the law of God.</hi>] 4.

               <p n="2">2. For the law of the ſpirit of life in Chriſt Jeſus, hath made me free from the law of ſin and death.</p>
               <p rend="small">2. For the Covenant of Grace which giveth the Spirit, and the Spirit ſo given me by Chriſt, being not a killing but a quickening Law, giving me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal and Spiritual Life; and Title to Eternal life, hath made me free from the Power and Rule of my
<pb facs="tcp:66325:156"/>
Carnal Inclination, and from the Obligation and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law.</p>
               <p n="3">3. For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the fleſh, God ſending his own Son in the likeneſs of ſinful fleſh, and for ſin condemned ſin in the fleſh.</p>
               <p rend="small">3. For when the meer Law could neither juſtifie nor Regenerate us, becauſe our fleſhly pravity was uncapable hereof, God ſending his own Son in fleſh like ours which is ſinful, though without ſin, as a Sacrifice for ſin, and example of perfect holineſs, thereby ſhewed his enmity to ſin, and began the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enterpriſe of its deſtruction.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That the righteouſneſs of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the fleſh, but after the ſpirit.</p>
               <p rend="small">4. That the true Righteouſneſs which the Law was made to lead Men to, might be found in us, and the true ends of the Law obtained by us, who live now by the Spiritual Principle and Rule, and not by the Carnal Principle and Letter.</p>
               <p n="5">5. For they that are after the fleſh, do mind the things of the fleſh: but they that are after the ſpirit, the things of the ſpirit.</p>
               <p rend="small">5. For the unregenerate who are under the Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Carnal Diſpoſition, though they may be under the terror of a threatning Law, do ſtill ſavour, love, and mind nothing ſo much as fleſhly Intereſt and Pleaſure: But they whoſe Souls are renewed by the Holy Spirit, and live by Faith on Spiritual Promiſes, do mind, love, and ſeek moſt Spiritual welfare and felicity.</p>
               <p n="6">6. For to be carnally minded, is death: but to be ſpiritually minded, is life and peace.</p>
               <p rend="small">6. For the true ſtate of miſery called Death in the Soul, which is the way to everlaſting miſery, conſiſteth in its being turned from the love of God and Holineſs, to the love of Carnal Intereſt and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and the true ſtate of Spiritual life and Felicity conſiſteth in the love of God and Holineſs, and the Souls perfection.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Becauſe the carnal mind is enmity to God; for it is not ſubject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.</p>
               <p rend="small">7. Becauſe the Carnal Unregenerate Mind, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a predominant inclination to inferiour ſenſual intereſts and delights, and a privation, yea and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to things Spiritual and Holy, hath thereby an enmity to the Holy Laws and Ways of God, and conſequently to God as Holy: For it is not ſubject to the Law of God, which is quite againſt their ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful life and inclination, nor indeed can be, while it ſo continueth; there being a contrariety between their Inclinations and the Law of God.</p>
               <p n="8">8. So then, they that are in the fleſh can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not pleaſe God.</p>
               <p rend="small">8. So that they that are Unregenerate and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, cannot pleaſe God while they are ſuch; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they cannot, through the perverſeneſs of their own Wills, do the things that pleaſe him, what le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal reſtraint ſoever they be under.</p>
               <p n="9">9. But ye are not in the fleſh, but in the Spirit, if ſo be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Chriſt, he is none of his.</p>
               <p rend="small">9. But you are not in this Carnal ſtate, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the dominion of the fleſh, if the Spirit of God do not only provoke you towards goodneſs, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo dwell in you and poſſeſs you; For it is a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, Spirit and will overcome the Fleſh: But if any Man have not this indwelling, illuminating, quicken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſanctifying Spirit, he is not a true Chriſtian, and ſaved by Chriſt. He may be baptiſed, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Church, and paſs for a viſible Member of it, and ſo for a Chriſtian among Men, but Chriſt will not own him as a living Member to Juſtification and Salvation.</p>
               <p n="10">10. And if Chriſt be in you, the body is dead becauſe of ſin, but the Spirit is life be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p rend="small">10. And if Chriſt by his Spirit and Government be and rule in you, the Body which hath ſtill ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate ſinful inclinations, and backwardneſs to good, ſhall die for ſin; but your Spirits being quickened by the Spirit of God, unto Holineſs and Juſtification, are in a ſtate of life begun, and ſhall not die as the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy doth, but live with Chriſt, by whom they live.</p>
               <p n="11">11. But if the Spirit of him that raiſed up Jeſus from the dead, dwell in you; he that raiſed up Chriſt from the dead, ſhall alſo quicken your mortal bodies, by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.</p>
               <p rend="small">11. But if the Spirit of him that raiſed up Jeſus from the dead dwell in you, he that by this ſame Spirit of life and power raiſed up Chriſt from the dead, as he hath begun to riſe you from Spiritual death in ſin, and ſanctifie both Soul and Body to himſelf, will not only glorifie your Souls, but alſo raiſe and ſave your Mortal Bodies, by that ſame Almighty Spirit which raiſed Chriſt, and ſanctified you.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the fleſh, to live after the fleſh. 13. For if ye live after the fleſh, ye ſhall die: But if ye through the Spirit do mortifie the deeds of the body, ye ſhall live.</p>
               <p rend="small">12, 13. By all which you may ſee that it is not to the Fleſh that we owe our chief reſpect, care and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, nor after the luſts of which we ſhould live: For it is this ſinful fleſhly life that cauſeth death, and tendeth unto future miſery: But if by the Spirit you mortifie thoſe fleſhly luſts and deeds, which Carnal Men obey and practiſe, this begining of Spiritual Life will end in future life and happineſs.</p>
               <p n="14">14. For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the ſons of God.</p>
               <p rend="small">
                  <pb facs="tcp:66325:157"/>14. For as many as are Principled and Ruled, by Gods Spirit and Spiritual Law of Grace, are Gods Children: And God will not forſake, loſe, or deſtroy his Spiritual Children.</p>
               <p n="15">15. For ye have not received the ſpirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.</p>
               <p rend="small">15. For the Spirit which you have now received is not that of a Slave, which doth no good but for fear of Puniſhment; (and the meer Law without Grace could give no better) but you have received the Spirit of Adoption, which giveth you an inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of dependance, love and truſt in God, much like that which a Child hath by nature to his Father, to the collation of which Child-like love, truſt and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the wondrous revelation of Gods love in Chriſt, and the free gifts of his Grace, were Spiritually fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
               <p n="16">16. The Spirit it ſelf beareth witneſs with our ſpirit, that we are the children of God.</p>
               <p rend="small">16. And to have this Spirit of God dwelling in us, and ſanctifying us, is a certain evidence or teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in and with our own Spirits and Conſciences, that God doth ſpecially love us, and take us for his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, having ſet his ſpecial mark upon us: For we could not love him as a Father, and he not love us as his Children. And this Spirit alſo helpeth our Conſciences to diſcern and exerciſe this fealing Grace, and to rejoyce therein.</p>
               <p n="17">17. And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joynt-heirs with Chriſt: if ſo be that we ſuffer with him, that we may alſo be glorified together.</p>
               <p rend="small">17. And if this Seal of the Spirit prove us Sons, it proveth us Heirs of the purchaſed Kingdom, or Heavenly Inheritance, for ſuch are all the Sons of God; Heirs of God, and Co-heirs with Chriſt; but ſo that there is a further condition of our poſſeſſion, even that we take up the croſs and follow him, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to be conformed to him in his ſufferings, if God call us to it, that ſo by the ſame way we may come to be glorified together with him.</p>
               <p n="18">18. For I reckon, that the ſufferings of this preſent time are not worthy to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the glory which ſhall be revealed in us.</p>
               <p rend="small">18. For though we muſt ſuffer in this life, with Chriſt, and for his ſake, and by Gods Correction for our ſins, having in my reckoning compared them with the promiſed effects and end, I fully reſolve the caſe, that they are not worthy to be compared with the Glory which in the Saints ſhall be ſhortly manifeſted; nor ſhould they ſtop any Man from en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining the Doctrine of the Croſs, and purſuing his Celeſtial hopes.</p>
               <p n="19">19. For the earneſt expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifeſtation of the ſons of God.</p>
               <p rend="small">19. For all the frame of Nature ſtrongly tending to its own perfection, (and God annihillateth not the Natural or Senſitive Creatures, though he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve the Compoſition) they do as it were wait for their better ſtate and deliverance from the Curſe cauſed by Mans ſins, till the manifeſtation of the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Sons of God; with whom, and for whom they ſhall have their reſtauration, as with Man they fell under the Curſe.</p>
               <p n="20">20. For the creature was made ſubject to vanity, not willingly, but by reaſon of him who hath ſubjected the ſame in hope.</p>
               <p rend="small">20. For ſo much of the world as was made for Man, and marr'd or curſed for mans ſake, ſo was made ſubject to this Curſe and Mutation, not for its own ſin, nor by its own choice, but by the ſin of Man, even by that God who ſubjected its condition to the free will and ſtate of Man, and ſo to ſuffer with and for him, but with a purpoſe to reſtore it with him unto its integrity.</p>
               <p n="21">21. Becauſe the creature it ſelf alſo ſhall be delivered from the bondege of corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, into the glorious liberty of the children of God.</p>
               <p rend="small">21. Becauſe the Natural and Senſitive parts of the World that were ſubjected to the uſe of Man, and fell under a Curſe by Man, ſhall be delivered with Man from that Curſe, and Bondage, and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptibility, into a ſtate of liberty and uſeful per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection ſuitable to the Glory of the Children of God, for whom they were made.</p>
               <p n="22">22. For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travelleth in pain together un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til now.</p>
               <p rend="small">22. For it is evident, that the whole Natural and Subjective World which was thus ſubjected to Man and curſed for him, is like a Woman in the pangs or expectation of Child-birth, and groaneth till it be delivered with us at that time of reſtoration.</p>
               <p n="23">23. And not only they, but our ſelves alſo, which have the firſt fruits of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, even we our ſelves groan within our ſelves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.</p>
               <p rend="small">23. And if this be their caſe, much more do we who have the Spirit of God, which is the Pledge, Earneſt, and Firſt-fruit of Glory, feeling our ſelves burdened with ſin, temptations and ſufferings in the World, and yet ſhort of our expected Glory, feel our ſelves as a Woman in Travel, groaning for delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and longing for the bleſſed inheritance, yea even the Reſurrection of the Body it ſelf, to which we were Adopted.</p>
               <p n="24">24. For we are ſaved by hope: But hope that is ſeen, is not hope; for what a man ſeeth, why doth he yet hope for?</p>

And the Spirit which God hath given us, help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us againſt our Infirmities of Hope and Prayer; and under our ſufferings and diſtreſſes; for we are unmeet judges of our own neceſſities and condition, and the fleſh is too prone to deſire its own eaſe and ſafety: But the Spirit of Chriſt in us, teacheth and inclineth us to go to God as to a merciful alſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Father, and to pour out our Souls complaints before him, at leaſt with groans, when we cannot utter them with Words, and to cry, Abba Father, and to refer our ſelves unto his Wiſdom, and caſt our caſe in truſt on him.</p>

               <p rend="small">27. And God that ſearcheth the Heart, knoweth the meaning of thoſe very groans, excited by his Spirit, which we want words to expreſs: For he knoweth what his own Spirit moveth us to ask, and what deſires come from himſelf; for as Chriſt is in Heaven our Interceſſor with the Father, ſo the Holy Spirit ſent down into our Hearts, is our Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor with the Father and the Son; for as he is Chriſts Agent and Witneſs in us, to communicate Spiritual Life, Light and Love to us, ſo he is a Spirit of Supplication and Adoption in us, and the ſpring of all our holy deſires and motions Godward, and that only which is of him is accepted of God; for he moveth us to ask what pleaſeth God, and to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to his Will, and returneth us the anſwer of our Prayers in inward ſtrength and conſolation.</p>
               <p n="28">28. And we know that all things work to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether for good to them that love God, to them who are called according to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
               <p rend="small">28.

               <p rend="small">29. For thoſe whom he fore-knew and purpoſed to glorifie, he alſo predeſtinated as the way to their Glory, to be conformed to the Image of his Son, in holineſs and patient ſuffering, that his Church as Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren might be like their Head and eldeſt Brother.</p>

               <p rend="small">30. And thoſe whom God thus predeſtinateth to be conformed to Chriſt, them in time he effectually called to repent and believe in Chriſt; and thoſe whom he thus called, and made true Chriſtians, he juſtified, both <hi>making them juſt by pardoning their ſin,</hi> and giving them his <hi>Indwelling Spirit</hi> of love and Holineſs, and <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting</hi> them juſt, for the merits of Chriſt; and thoſe whom he thus juſtifieth, he will glorifie with Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="31">31. What ſhall we then ſay to theſe things? If God be for us, who can be againſt us?</p>
               <p rend="small">31. What then ſhall we ſay, when we conſider all this, but with joyful thankfulneſs conclude, that God is for his Saints, their Father and Protector, and therefore they have no cauſe to fear any that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, how great, or many, or ſtrong ſoever; that is, not fear their power, ſo be it we take heed that they draw us not to ſin.</p>

               <p rend="small">32. He that ſpared not his own Son, not thinking him too precious a giſt, but delivered him up to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer as a Sacrifice to procure the pardon of ſin and ſalvation, to be given to all by a Conditional Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, of faith and acceptance, and actually to pardon and ſave all true Believers, that accept him, how can it be that he ſhould think any thing elſe which we need too good for us, and not freely give all other things with Chriſt to us that believingly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept him.

                  <p n="1">I. THe Controverſies raiſed about the firſt fourteen Verſes, of the fulfilling of the Righteouſneſs of the Law; of the Carnal and Spiritual ſtate of Mind, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are ſufficiently decided in the Paraphraſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. So is that of the Spirit of Bondage and Adoption, and that of the Witneſs of the Spirit with our Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the Paraphraſe on the 15 and 16 Verſes.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. His Expoſition of the 19, 20, 21, and 22 Verſes, which feigneth them to ſpeak of the Heathen World, hath ſo many and palpable Violences, that I think it not worth the labour to give a particular Confutation of them. But if many things about the Creatures Reſtoration be yet unknown and unrevealed to us, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth not, that therefore it is unknown whether a Reſtoration there ſhall be. The Heavens muſt contain Chriſt till the time of this Reſtoration. And his Violence is as groſs about the Words of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> That we look for a new Heaven and a new Earth, in which dwelleth Righteouſneſs. What God doth with the Souls of Brutes when they die hence, may be unknown to us, and yet their Reſtoration known. It is not hard, by the moſt probable Principles of Philoſophy, to ſhame their Opinion who confidently ſay, that their Souls are no Spiritual Subſtances, but evanid Accidents, Qualities, or Motions. And as they may eaſily be proved Subſtances, that have an Eſſential Power of Vital Action, Perception, and Appetite; ſo it is moſt improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that God annihilateth them, or changeth their eſſential Form or Nature. But whether they are conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued: Individuate, or onely<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in one or more univerſal Form; and if Individuate, whither or to what uſe God diſpoſeth of them, and what alteration there will be in the State of Reſtoration, Mortals know not.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. Thoſe that ſay, That by the <hi>Spirit that helpeth our infirmities,</hi> ver. 26. is meant Chriſt by his Spirit pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for us in Heaven, can neither make it agree with the Context, nor prove that the Spirit groaneth in Heaven, or is called our Interceſſour there, but within us.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. They that feign the 28 Verſe to ſay, That all the Sins of Believers ſhall work for their good, dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerouſly pervert the Text: It's contrary to the Context, and to the tenor of all the Scripture, and the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Holineſs of God, and the Safety of Believers, to feign God to promiſe them, that how much ſoever they ſin, they ſhall be Gainers by it; when he ſtill uſeth the clean contrary means to ſave them from it, even by his Threatnings. And it's contrary to the very Terms of the Text, [<hi>To them that love God, &amp;c.</hi>] which implieth, that the defects or decay of their Love to God is not for their good. And it's contrary to common Experience, which tells us, that many Chriſtians by Sin loſe ſome degrees of Love to God, and other Grace, and die worſe than once they were, (and ſo have a leſs degree of Glory.) And is this for their good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Yea, all Men die in ſome Sin of Omiſſion, as in a culpable defect of ſome due Act or Degree of Faith, Hope, Love, Joy, Patience, of which they have no more time to repent. And what good doth that do them?

                  <p n="6">VI. The Controverſies about Predeſtination, raiſed from the 28 and 29 Verſes, might be ended by the Text it ſelf, if we could be content to know no more than God doth teach us, and to be no wiſer than St. <hi>Paul</hi> was.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He teacheth us, That there are ſome called according to God's purpoſe, and foreknown by him, that is, to be ſuch as he will uſe as is after mentioned: He knoweth them to be thoſe whom he purpoſeth to call and ſave. But <hi>Paul</hi> was not ſo preſumptuous and profane, as to diſpute, How God foreknoweth them, or why he purpoſeth to call them rather than others.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And whereas profane Men do fooliſhly ſay, If God decree and foreknow my Salvation, I ſhall be ſaved whatever I do; and if he do not, I ſhall not: St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, That thoſe whom God purpoſeth or decreeth to ſave, he predeſtinateth to be conformed to the Image of his Son, even to the Means, as well as to the End. So that, to ſay, That God doth predeſtinate Men to Salvation, and not to Holineſs of Heart and Life, is to contradict God's Doctrine of Predeſtination. As God doth decree how long we ſhall live, and withal that we ſhall live by Meat and Drink; ſo he decreeth that we ſhall be ſaved, and that by Faith and ſincere Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. And ſure they know not what they ſay, who call this Doctrine of Election, Licentious. Doth it encourage Men to Impenitency or Diſobedience, to tell them, that God doth predeſtinate Men to repent, and obey, and be ſaved? Will it tempt Men to live after the Fleſh, in Worldlineſs, or Senſuality, to believe that God hath decreed to make them to live after the Spirit, and to mortifie the Deeds of the Fleſh, and to avoid ſuch Sins?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, That this Chain of Cauſes is all decreed of God, from the firſt to the laſt; and therefore that it is God's Purpoſe which ſecureth the Event of our Glorification. And it's ſtrange that any ſhould think, that God ſhould undertake ſo great a Work as Mans Redemption, and not effectually ſecure the Succeſs by his own Will and Wiſdom, but leave all to the lubricous Will of Man.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. But the Apoſtle tells us of no ſuch Decrees of the Cauſes of Mens Damnation. God cauſeth and giveth Grace, and foreknoweth that which he will give: But he doth not cauſe or give Men Sin, nor neceſſitate any to commit it; and therefore decreeth not to cauſe it, nor foreknoweth it as his own Work, but as Mans. So that Election and Non-election, or Reprobation, are not of the ſame kind, degree, and order.</p>
                  <p n="7">VII. The ſenſe of the Terms of the 30 Verſe, Expoſitors much differ about; but there is no great Doctrinal Controverſie depending on it. 1. It is doubted, whether by [<hi>Calling</hi>] here be meant only <hi>Effectual Calling</hi> and Converſion, or only <hi>General Calling</hi> antecedent to its Efficacy. But it's confeſſed, that both theſe are aſſerted in the Scripture. 2. It is doubted, why Sanctification is omitted, or where it is included: But it's agreed, that it is one Link of the Chain of the Cauſes of Salvation. 3. And ſo it's doubted, what the Word [<hi>Juſtifie</hi>] doth mean: But the thing is agreed on. 4. And the greateſt doubt is, whether every one of theſe Cauſes will infer the reſt, or only the connexion of all the foregoing will infer that which followeth.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. There is ſmall reaſon to doubt, but that by [<hi>Calling</hi>] is meant [<hi>Effectual Calling</hi>]: Elſe it would neither prove Predeſtination, nor infer Juſtification.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Sanctification</hi> is a Word which ſignifieth many Acts. As it ſignifieth the Gift of our firſt Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and our Covenant-devotedneſs to God in Baptiſm, it is the ſame with Effectual Vocation, Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and Converſion. But as it ſignifieth the after-gift of the In-dwelling Spirit, to habituate the Soul with fixed Holineſs and Love, and the Practice of theſe, it followeth Vocation, at leaſt in order of Nature.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 <hi>Juſtification</hi> ſometime ſignifieth Making us righteous; ſometime, <hi>accounting</hi> us righteous; ſometime, by Apology, maintaining us to be righteous; ſometime, by Judicial Sentence, pronoun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ing us righteous; ſometime, executively, uſing us as righteous; uſually, many of theſe together, all the reſt being implied. It is certain, that God <hi>maketh</hi> Men righteous, before he account or judge them righteous. Now to make a Man righteous (and juſtifiable in Judgment) all theſe concur. 1. The Merit of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, as the deſerving Matter and Cauſe. 2. The Act of the New Covenant, giving him a part in Chriſt, and with him Pardon of Sin, and Right to the Spirit of Grace, and unto Glory. 3. The Gift of Faith and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, that Chriſt and his further Grace may be ours; and for continuance, the holy Habits and Acts of Sancti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

And ſeeing all ſound Expoſitors confeſs (with <hi>Beza</hi>) that at leaſt three Texts by Juſtification mean or include Sanctification, we have reaſon to judge, that part of Sanctification is here included in Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and part in Juſtification, and, ſome think, the Triumphant part in Glorification. And certainly this inferreth no unſound Doctrine.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> thought, that the Links of this are ſeparable, unleſs you include the firſt as the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification of all the reſt, by way of diſtinction; and that the meaning is, That [God will call all the Predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate or Elect, and will juſtifie all the Predeſtinate that are called, and will glorifie all the Juſtified that are predeſtinate and called]; but that there are ſome juſtified and ſanctified, that were not predeſtinate, nor ſhall be glorified, but fall away.

                  <p n="8">VIII. As to the Doubt, Whether the 38 and 39 Verſes ſpeak [<hi>of God's Love to us, or ours to him,</hi>] as they are in themſelves inſeparable, ſo I think that the Context giveth us Reaſon to think that it is both, even the Bond of mutual Love which is here ſpoken of.

                  <head>ANNOTATIONS.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. THis Chapter is ordinarily miſunderſtood, 1. Becauſe Men obſerve not what it is that <hi>Paul</hi> is proving. 2. And becauſe they diſtinguiſh not God's Acts which he doth as an <hi>Owner</hi> and Benefactor, from thoſe Acts of Juſtice which he doth as Rector to Subjects under his Laws and Covenants. 3. And becauſe they diſtinguiſh not the Common Law of Grace made to fallen Mankind, from the Covenant of Peculiarity proper to the Jews.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Many think that <hi>Paul</hi> here giveth the Reaſon from God's meer Will and Reprobating Decree, why ſome are Unbelievers and hardned in Sin, and are not pardoned and ſaved, when others are. 2. And ſo they think, that God pardoneth, and juſtifieth, and ſaveth Men, without any Reaſon or Cauſe fetch'd from their different Qualifications, but meerly from his Will. 3. And they think, that <hi>Eſau</hi> was not onely ſhut out from the Covenant of Peculiarity, but alſo from the Commoner Covenant or Law of Grace, and was hated to Damnation, meerly from the antecedent Will of God. But contrarily,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is evident, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> is but proving and juſtifying God's free Mercy in calling the Gentiles, while he permitted the obſtinate part of the Jews to cut off themſelves by Unbelief, and wilfully rejecting Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. And that he ſpeaketh not at all of any arbitrary Inequality in his Rewards and Puniſhments, but only in his free Gifts; all Men ſhould underſtand, that God is to Man, 1. Our Owner. 2. Our Benefactor. 3. Our Rector. 1. As an Owner, he may do with his own as he will. 2. As our Benefactor, he giveth many things antecedently to his Laws, and many things beſides what he there promiſeth. And as a Lord and Benefactor, he diſtributeth his Gifts with incomprehenſible arbitrary variety; and none have cauſe to accuſe him for giving another more than them. He wrongs not the Stars, by not making them Suns; nor the Clouds, by not making them Stars; nor Men, by not making them Angels; nor Beaſts, in not making them Men, nor Worms, or Toads, by making them no better. And ſcarce two things in the World are like, without any diſſimilitude or inequality.</p>
                  <p>But when he hath made a Law, of Precepts, Prohibitions, Rewards, and Puniſhments, it is his Juſtice equally to perform them to all, according to their Qualifications and Titles. He pardoneth all Believers and none elſe: He glorifieth all that are juſtified and ſanctified, and none elſe: and giveth the Reaſon of the different Sentences, from their Qualifications and Works, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which he doth not in his Gifts, as meer Benefactor. So that he doth not ſay, that the Reaſon why ſome are pardoned and ſaved, is not in him that willeth, and him that runneth; but the Reaſon why, of two ill-deſerving Perſons or Nations, one is overcome by decreed effectual Grace, and the other hath not that Grace that ſo overcometh his wilful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. And when <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh of <hi>Eſau</hi> being hated, the Text alledged meaneth no more but that the <hi>Edo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites</hi> were expoſed to God's overflowing Puniſhments on Earth, and that <hi>Eſau</hi> was <hi>leſs loved</hi> than <hi>Jacob,</hi> and he and his Seed rejected from the Covenant of Peculiarity: But as it is certain that they were under that Law of Mercy made to Mankind in fallen <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Noah,</hi> ſo it is not ſaid in Scripture, that <hi>Eſau</hi> was damned or void of Saving Grace.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. As to the Hardning of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and others, it being agreed by all ſober Chriſtians, that God cauſeth not Sin, we need to debate it no further, Whether the ſenſe be, That he denieth them ſoftning con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting Grace when they have forfeited it by wilful Reſiſtance, and ſo permitteth them to be hardned; or, Whether it be, that he doth thoſe good and righteous Acts which he knows they will be wilfully hardned by, as Occaſions and Objects: or both theſe.</p>
                  <p>Here is not the leaſt hint, that God damneth any, or decreeth ſo to do, meerly becauſe he will do it, without any Reaſon taken from their own Deſerts: Or, that he maketh ſome Men Sinners, or damneth them, meerly as the Potter differenceth his Veſſels of Clay: But only, that when all have deſerved to be forſaken and condemned, and he giveth Common Grace for their Recovery to all, why he freely giveth more, which ſhall be infallibly effectual, to ſome, rather than to others, when thoſe ſome were no better than the reſt.</p>
                  <p>It's ſaid by ſome School-men, That Mens Damnation is cauſed by Sin, but God's Decree to damn them is not, nor hath any Cauſe. But this muſt be more diſtinctly anſwered. By <hi>God's Decree to damn Men,</hi> is meant, 1. Either the Effects of his Will; 2. Or his <hi>Will it ſelf</hi>; 3. Or his Will as extrinſecally denominated from the Object correlated to it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. No doubt but Puniſhment, which is the Effect of his Will, hath a Meritorious Cauſe, in Mans Sin.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Will of God, or his Decree, conſidered as in God, is nothing but his Eſſence, which hath no Cauſe; and is not in it ſelf called a Decree to damn Men.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Denomination of God's Will from its relation to the extrinſick Object, hath objective Cauſe, the Object qualified.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:66325:161"/>Whoever truly repenteth and believeth, may be ſure of his Juſtification; and it's ſinful to doubt of it on pretence that God may condemn whom he will, when he hath told whom he will not condemn: And whoever is unregenerate and ungodly, may be ſure he is unjuſtified, and unpardoned, and in a damnable ſtate; for God hath aſſured us of this in his Word.</p>

               <p n="1">1. BRethren, my hearts deſire and prayer to God for Iſrael is, that they might be ſaved. 2. For I bear them record, that they have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge.</p>
               <p rend="small">1, 2. My great deſire and prayer to God for <hi>Iſrael</hi> is, that they may be converted and ſaved: And it is laudible in them that they have a Zeal of God, and his Law and Worſhip; but it is fruſtrate, becauſe miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guided by errour.</p>
               <p n="3">3. For they being ignorant of Gods righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and going about to eſtabliſh their own righteouſneſs, have not ſubmitted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the righteouſneſs of God.</p>
               <p rend="small">3. For they being ignorant of God's way of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and Righteouſneſs, intended as the end of the Law, and freely given by Grace, and fully now revealed in the Goſpel by Jeſus Chriſt, and truſting to their own Works of the Law as a ſufficient Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs to juſtifie them, have by their errour re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected Gods free gift of Juſtification by Faith in Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="4">4. For Chriſt is the end of the law for righteouſneſs to every one that believeth.</p>
               <p rend="small">4. For they ſhould have underſtood, that the ſenſe and uſe of the Law is to lead them for Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs to Chriſt, who is its end, and prefigured in its Sacrifices and other Types.</p>
               <p n="5">5. For Moſes deſcribeth the righteouſneſs which is of the law, That the man which doth thoſe things ſhall live by them.</p>
               <p rend="small">5. For though the Law do point Men to a better Righteouſneſs, yet in it ſelf as a Law, it owneth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing as a Righteouſneſs ſufficient to Juſtification, but that which <hi>Moſes</hi> thus diſcribeth, <hi>Lev.</hi> 18.5. The Man that doth theſe things, and breaketh not this Law, ſhall live by them.</p>
               <p n="6">6. But the righteouſneſs which is of faith, ſpeaketh on this wiſe, Say not in thy heart, Who ſhall aſcend into heaven? (that is, to bring Chriſt down from above) 7. Or, Who ſhall deſcend into the deep? (that is, to bring up Chriſt again from the dead.) 8. But what ſaith it? The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is the word of faith which we preach,</p>
               <p rend="small">6, 7, 8. But I may deſcribe the Righteouſneſs which is of Faith in the Words of <hi>Moſes, Deut.</hi> 30. <hi>Say not in thy Heart, Who ſhall aſcend into Heaven,</hi> (or how can we know Gods Will, that never were in Heaven? Or who ſhall bring us thence a certain Meſſenger of it) or, <hi>Who ſhall deſcend into the deep,</hi> (or it is hid from us like the depths of the Sea, and who ſhall fetch it to our Knowledge?) But as it ſaith, <hi>The word is nigh thee</hi>; God hath not concealed it, but ſent it from Heaven: Chriſt is come down to make known God and his Word; and he is riſen, and gone to intercede for us in Heaven: And he hath brought his Goſpel both to our Eyes, Mouth, and Ears, and writeth it by his Spirit in our Hearts. And <hi>Moſes</hi> there ſeemeth to intend ſuch a way of Righteouſneſs by free Grace to the Repenting <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites.</hi> And this is it which our Preaching fuller re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealeth to you.</p>
               <p n="9">9. That if thou ſhalt confeſs with thy mouth the Lord Jeſus, and ſhalt believe in thy heart that God hath raiſed him from the dead, thou ſhalt be ſaved.</p>
               <p rend="small">9. That if thou confeſs Chriſt before Men, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding perſecution, and own him as Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the world, and believe truly and heartily that God raiſed him from the dead, and thereby witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that he owned him, and juſtified the truth of his Goſpel, thou ſhalt be ſaved (as well as juſtified. For to juſtifie a Man, is partly to juſtifie his Right to Salvation.)</p>
               <p n="10">10. For with the heart man believeth to righreouſneſs, and with the mouth confeſſion is made unto ſalvation.</p>
               <p rend="small">10. For theſe two make up the Goſpel terms of Life: To give up <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Body</hi> to Chriſt; if thou believe ſincerely in him with thy Heart, thou wilt be accepted for his Merits by God as <hi>Righteous</hi>; and if thou conſtantly confeſs and own him, whatever thou ſuffer by it from Men, by <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Deed,</hi> in obedience and patience, thou ſhalt poſſeſs the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to which thy Juſtification initially gave thee right.</p>
               <p n="11">11. For the ſcripture ſaith, Whoſoever believeth on him ſhall not be aſhamed.</p>
               <p rend="small">11. For <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.16. God hath prmiſed us in his Word, that whoever believeth on him, and truſteth him on his Promiſe, and practically placeth his hope accordingly, ſhall never be diſappointed and aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of that Hope.</p>
               <p n="12">12. For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the ſame Lord over all, is rich unto all that call upon him.</p>
               <p rend="small">12. For God is no reſpecter of perſons, and ſaveth not Men, or rejecteth Men, becauſe they are <hi>Jews</hi> or
<pb facs="tcp:66325:161"/>
                  <hi>Greeks.</hi> The Law of Grace doth equally pardon and juſtifie <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile</hi> that truly repent and believe, and no other: He is the ſame Lord over all, and is Rich in Mercy to all that call on him in Faith, (for when he proclaimed his Name to <hi>Moſes, Exod.</hi> 34. [as gracious and merciful, forgiving iniquity tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on and ſin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] it was his very Nature and Decree by which he would be known to all the World, and not only by the <hi>Jews.</hi>)</p>
               <p n="13">13. For whoſoever ſhall call on the Name of the Lord, ſhall be ſaved.</p>
               <p rend="small">13. For as it is ſaid, <hi>Joel</hi> 2.32. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall call on the name of the Lord ſhall he ſaved</hi>; that is, of what Nation ſoever he be, if he truly ſeek God, he will be found of him; and if he fear God and work Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs by Faith, he ſhall be accepted of him; for he is the Rewarder of them that diligently ſeek him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6.</p>
               <p n="14">14. How then ſhall they call on him in whom they have not believed? And how ſhall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? And how ſhall they hear without a preacher?</p>
               <p rend="small">14. And this ſheweth you the neceſſity of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Goſpel; for how ſhall Men ſeek, and worſhip, and call on that God and Saviour in whom they have not believed? And how ſhall they believe in him of whom they have never heard? And how ſhall they hear, if no one tell them, or preach to them? (Even the Works of Nature, and Providence that reveal God darkly, muſt be told Men by Inſtructors, to make them capable of underſtanding them: Much more the Goſpel of Chriſt.)</p>
               <p n="15">15. And how ſhall they preach except they be ſent? As it is written, How beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful are the feet of them that preach the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things?</p>
               <p rend="small">15. And how ſhall Men Preach the Myſteries of Salvation, that are not called and ſent of God, by his Qualifications and Commiſſion? for who can be ſuch a Light in the World, that is not taught and gifted by the Father of Lights? And who can in Gods name proclaim the Word of Reconciliation as his Meſſenger, who is not authorized by him ſo to do? We love glad Tidings, and welcome the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers of them; and this ſhould be the Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſts Apoſtles and Miniſters in the World, who bring the moſt joiful Tidings of Salvation. As it is written, <hi>How beautiful are the Feet of them that,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 52.7.</p>
               <p n="16">16. But they have not all obeyed the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel: for Eſaias ſaith, Lord, who hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved our report?</p>
               <p rend="small">16. But you may ſay, Why then doth not this Preaching convert more of the <hi>Jews?</hi> This excellence of the Goſpel, and the preaching of it, doth not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that all that have it will be converted by it: For of the <hi>Jews, Iſaiah</hi> ſaith, <hi>Lord who hath believed our Report</hi>? Few did hearken to the Prophets, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.1.</p>
               <p n="17">17. So then, faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.</p>
               <p rend="small">17. It is evident, that they muſt hear, that they may believe; and Gods Word muſt be preach'd to them, or made known, that they may hear it.</p>
               <p n="18">18. But I ſay, Have they not heard? Yes verily: for their ſound went out into all the earth, and their words to the ends of the world.</p>
               <p rend="small">18. But is not the World excuſable then in their ſin, for want of preaching? I anſwer, As God tells us, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. That the viſible Works of God do Preach him, (even his Power, Wiſdom and Goodneſs) to all the World, which will leave it without all juſt excuſe; (See <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.20, 21.) So Chriſt ſent his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles with a Commiſſion to preach to all Nations; and many Nations have already heard his Goſpel.</p>
               <p n="19">19. But I ſay, Did not Iſrael know? Firſt, Moſes ſaith, I will provoke you to jealouſie by them that are no people, and by a fooliſh na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will I anger you.</p>
               <p rend="small">19. But have not the <hi>Jews</hi> had notice of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, when it was firſt preached to them, and rejected by them? The very converſion of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that Chriſt whom they rejected, which is matter of envy to them, ſhall leave them without excuſe; as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.21. <hi>I will provoke you to jealouſie by,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="20">20. But Eſaias is very bold, and ſaith, I was found of them that ſought me not, I was made manifeſt to them that asked not after me. 21. But to Iſrael he ſaith, All day long I have ſtretched forth my hands to a diſobedient and gainſaying people.</p>
               <p rend="small">20, 21. But <hi>Iſaiah</hi> boldly and plainly foretells Gods calling the <hi>Gentiles</hi> by free Grace, and ſeeking them that firſt ſought not him; and his rejecting the <hi>Jews</hi> as a People that after his long ſuffering did continue obſtinately to reject his Word and Grace, ſaying, <hi>I was found of them that ſought me not,</hi> &amp;c. and, <hi>All days long have I ſtreched forth,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. THe 12, 13, 14, and 15 Verſes are controverted by Expoſitors, as to the Queſtion, Whether they aſſert or deny the Salvation of any that hear not of Chriſt; becauſe (on one ſide) it it is ſaid, That
<pb facs="tcp:66325:162"/>
ever doth call on the Name of the Lord ſhall be ſaved; and the 19<hi>th.</hi> Pſalm is cited, which tell us how Gods Works do preach him to all the World, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And on the other ſide, <hi>How ſhall they hear without a Preacher</hi>? &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> We muſt not confound the doubt of the ſenſe of this Text, with the doubt of the Matter, which is the Salvation of Men that hear not the Goſpel: As to the former, I have ſaid what I thought needful in the Paraphraſe, and leave it to the judgment of the Reader.</p>
                  <p>As to the Matter, I think this much following may ſatisfie the ſober. 1. We muſt firſt know what Law of God ſuch Men are under, and then how far it juſtifieth them. It is certain, that the World (once guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſin and death) is not under the Law of Innocency, which maketh Innocency the only Condition of Life (now it is loſt to all.) And it is certain, that they are neither Lawleſs, or ſhut up as Devils in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair; but that they have duties and means of Repentance, Recovery, Mercy, and Salvation impoſed on them, which they are bound to uſe for theſe ends in hope; and they have much forfeited Mercy given to them all, which proveth that God uſeth them not according to the Law of Innocency. And it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that God made to all Mankind in fallen <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Noah</hi> a Law of Mercy and Grace; and that when he proclaimed his name to <hi>Moſes, Exod.</hi> 34. The Lord gracious and merciful, forgiving, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it was his Nature, and his way of Governing of Mankind which he proclaimed. And ſo that all the world is under a Law which offereth Pardon and Life on other terms than ſinleſs Innocency.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is certain, that the ſuperadded Covenant of Peculiarity to the <hi>Jews,</hi> or the preaching of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of Chriſt Incarnate to part of the world only, repealed not any of the merciful Law, or Terms be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore given to all the World: Chriſt added more Mercy, but took away none; much leſs ſo much from moſt of the World: He came not to condemn the World, but to ſave.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is certain, that all Men ſhall be judged according to the Law that they were under, and obliged by, and no other.</p>
                  <p>4. It's certain, that the Apoſtles themſelves, though in a ſtate of Grace, believed not till Chriſt was riſen, that he muſt die a Sacrifice for ſin, riſe from the dead, aſcend and intercede in Heaven, ſend down the emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent gift of the Holy Ghoſt, call the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> gather a Catholick Church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Therefore it was not all our Articles of Faith that were neceſſary before Chriſts coming; but the belief of ſo much as was then revealed.</p>
                  <p>But, 2. What others do that hear not of Chriſt, in fact, who repenteth, believeth, and is ſaved, God is only fit to judge; it belongeth not to us. But we may ſay, that the caſe of <hi>Melchizedeck, Job</hi> and his Friends, and many others, prove, that Grace and Salvation were not confined to the <hi>Jews.</hi> And that <hi>Abraham</hi> thought that even <hi>Sodom</hi> had fifty Righteous Perſons, when it was worſe than other places of the World. And he that will well read <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. <hi>Acts</hi> 14. and 17. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1, and 2. may yet receive fuller ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction from God.</p>
                  <p n="11">II. About Miniſters Miſſion, <hi>verſe</hi> 15. It's doubted whether we may hear any, till we know that God ſent them: And it is the device of the <hi>Roman</hi> Clergy, to puzzle the ignorant, by objecting againſt the Miſſion and Ordination of Proteſtant Miniſters, to draw Men from hearing them as Miniſters of Chriſt, claiming to themſelves the Peculiarity of Divine Commiſſion and Authority, as the only Church that have uninterrupted Succeſſion of Canonical Ordination. But as the Interruption of theirs is eaſily proved, ſo it's moſt certain, that God hath not made it an antecedent neceſſary thing to the belief of his Goſpel, for all Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to be firſt ſo well acquianted with Hiſtory, as to know what continuance or interruption there hath been in all Countreys of Canonical Ordination.</p>
                  <p>In ſhort, 1. A Lay-man is not to be heard that brings the Goſpel. 2. He that wanteth ſome Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of Order, neceſſary ordinarily to the right ordering of the Church, may yet have all that is eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to the Miniſtry.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He that hath juſt abilities, and mutual conſent of him and a Chriſtian Flock that need him, hath all that is eſſentially neceſſary.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. He that is ordained by Concordant Senior Paſtors of that Church, hath all that is neceſſary eſſentially to Ordination.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. He that ſeemeth to have ſuch Qualifications or Ordination, but hath not, but is in poſſeſſion upon deceiving probability, is a Paſtor to that Church, ſo far that his Miniſtrations ſhall be valed to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, though not to juſtifie himſelf from the guilt of profane uſurpation.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The People that love their Souls muſt be more careful what Doctrine a Miniſter preacheth, than what Ordination he hath.</p>
                  <p>7. In divers caſes the Magiſtrates Authority may ſerve without Ordination, and in ſome the Peoples choice alone, though, where it may lawfully be had, juſt and regular Ordination ſhould not be neglected, ſeeing none may be himſelf the ſole Judge of his own call and fitneſs.</p>

               <p n="1">1. I Say then, Hath God caſt away his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple? God forbid: for I alſo am an Iſraelite, of the ſeed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.</p>
               <p rend="small">1. But what? do I by all this conclude, that God hath broken his Covenant with <hi>Abraham</hi> and utterly caſt off the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi>? Not at all. For I, and all Believing <hi>Jews,</hi> are the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> not caſt off.</p>
               <p n="2">2. God hath not caſt away his people which he foreknew. Wot ye not what the ſcripture ſaith to Elias? how he maketh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion to God againſt Iſrael, ſaying, 3. Lord, they have killed thy prophets, and digged down thine altars, and I am left alone, and they ſeek my life.</p>
               <p rend="small">2, 3. God hath among the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> his foreknown and choſen People: And theſe he doth not caſt off, though he leave the reſt in their Rebellion. Know ye not what <hi>Elias</hi> thought and ſaid of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in his time, That he was left alone, as if they had been all Revolters.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But what ſaith the anſwer of God unto hm? I have reſerved to my ſelf ſeven thouſand men, who have not bowed the knee to the image of Baal.</p>
               <p rend="small">4. But God knew of more than <hi>Elias</hi> did: He had ſeven thouſand that were no Idolaters.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Even ſo then at this preſent time alſo, there is a remnant according to the election of grace.</p>
               <p rend="small">5. So now alſo God hath his choſen Remnant, whom his Grace hath brought to Faith in Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And if by grace, then it is no more of works: otherwiſe grace is no more grace. But if it be of works, then is it no more grace: otherwiſe work is no more work.</p>
               <p rend="small">6. And if they are choſen and made his juſtified People by Grace and Free Gift for the Merits of Chriſt, then it cannot be by the Merit of our own Performance of the Law. And if it be by the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of ſuch Performance; deſerving not Death but Life, then it is not of meer Grace or free Gift. For what need a man Pardon, who deſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rveth not Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment? or, to have life freely given him, which is his due for the Merit of his Work? (For I here give you notice, that it is no Works that I ſpeak of and exclude, but that which excludeth Free Gift and Grace, and not that which ſubo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>dinately obeyeth Grace, and doth ſuppoſe it.)</p>
               <p n="7">7. What then? Iſrael hath not obtained that which he ſeeketh for: But the election hath obtained it, and the reſt were blinded.</p>
               <p rend="small">7. The whole Nation of the <hi>Jews</hi> have not obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed deliverance by the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> though they ſought, and hoped, and waited for him: But God's Elect ones have obtained it, and the reſt miſs of it, becauſe their Sin and Prejudice blindeth them.</p>
               <p n="8">8. According as it is written, God hath given them the ſpirit of ſlumber, eyes that they ſhould not ſee, and ears that they ſhould not hear until this day.</p>
               <p rend="small">8. As it is written, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29.10. Becauſe they would not obey the Spirit of God, that would have awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened and enlightned them, God hath juſtly given them up to the ſeduction of the Spirit of Slumber, Stupidity, and Blindneſs; from whence it is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that they ſee not and hear not to this day, being deprived of his Spirits Illumination.</p>
               <p n="9">9. And David ſaith, Let their table be made a ſnare, and a trap, and a ſtumbling-block, and a recompence unto them. 10. Let their eyes be darkned, that they may not ſee, and bow down their back alway.</p>
               <p rend="small">9, 10. And <hi>David</hi> Prophetically prayed for ſuch Judgments on the obſtinate Enemies of the Juſt, that for a Recompence of their Malice God would turn their Comforts into Puniſhments, and forſake them, ſaying, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="11">11. I ſay then, Have they ſtumbled that they ſhould fall? God forbid: But rather through their fall ſalvation is come unto the Gentiles, for to provoke them to jealouſie.</p>
               <p rend="small">11. But what? Are they utterly forſaken and caſt off? And had God no better End herein than their Deſtruction? No ſuch thing. But the greater part were permitted juſtly to drive away the Goſpel from them to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> that theſe being converted, might after occaſion their Converſion in the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Church.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Now if the fall of them be the riches of the world, and the diminiſhing of them the riches of the Gentiles, how much more their fulneſs?</p>
               <p rend="small">12. And if the <hi>Gentiles</hi> have been ſo great Gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers by occaſion of the Sin and Fall of the <hi>Jews,</hi> how much more when they ſhall become <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> will they add to the Glory and Greatneſs of the Catholick Chriſtian Church.</p>
               <p n="13">13. For I ſpeak to you Gentiles; inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as I am the apoſtle of the Gentiles, I magnifie my office.</p>

                  <p>THe great Doubt about this Chapter is, what is propheſies of the full Converſion of the <hi>Jews.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which, I ſhall onely ſpeak ſo much as is certain, and leave the reſt to the Judgment of others.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is certain, that God never meant to reſtore the Jewiſh Politie under <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law; for that Law is abrogated by Chriſt, and ſo that Politie. It's Jewiſh Contradiction of Chriſtianity to expect ſuch a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoration.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Much leſs will God ever confine the Church and Covenant of Peculiarity to the Jewiſh Nation, and take it from the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and ceaſe Catholiciſm.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Nor will God reſtore and confine the <hi>Jews</hi> to their ancient Country in <hi>Paleſtine</hi>; which being ſuch a Country of <hi>Wales,</hi> now barren, and about half as big as <hi>England,</hi> would be far from making them a People of eminent Glory in the World, but rather contemptible in that reſpect.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Nor hath God promiſed to make the <hi>Jews</hi> Lords and Rulers over the reſt of the Nations of the Earth, as the Carnal ſort of them did expect.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Therefore no other calling of the <hi>Jews</hi> can be expected, but that they become Parts of the Catholick-Church.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. It ſeems to me by Hiſtory, that this is performed long ago, the main Body of their Nation being turned to Chriſtianity. To which purpoſe, conſider theſe things.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb facs="tcp:66325:164"/>1. Myriads were converted in <hi>Judea</hi> by the Apoſtles.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In all other Countries of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, the ſcattered <hi>Jews</hi> had Synagogues, to which the Apoſtles firſt Preached, and where they firſt gathered the Rudiments of the Chriſtian Churches.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. A vaſt Number of the unbelieving <hi>Jews</hi> were deſtroyed by <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> when <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was beſieged and deſtroyed.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Many more <hi>Jews</hi> were then converted, when they ſaw God's Judgements executed on them, and the Chriſtians ſpared.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Vaſt Numbers of the remainder of the Unbelievers were deſtroyed by <hi>Adrian,</hi> and the Chriſtians ſpared, and many turned Chriſtians then.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Since then many have been converted by Solemn Diſputes, and many <hi>Jews</hi> become eminent Doctors in the Church.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. They were ever fond of their own Country, and therefore we may ſuppoſe, that as many as could, lived there. And it's known, that all Conquerours uſe to tranſplant only the Rich and Ruling Men, and leave the Multitude of the poor Labourers to manure the Ground, that it may yield them Tribute. So did <hi>Nebuchadnezzar:</hi> And ſo in <hi>England</hi> did the <hi>Romans, Saxons, Danes,</hi> and <hi>Normans</hi>: They left the Vulgar to poſſeſs the Land under them, or elſe the Land would have been unprofitable to them. It was the Rich and the Soldiers that they drove into <hi>Wales</hi>; ſo that we are moſtly of a <hi>Britiſh</hi> Off-ſpring. Now it is known, that in the Days of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> and the following Chriſtian Emperours, (though no Country wholly turned Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian of a long time) <hi>Judea</hi> turned as other Provinces did; and had their Biſhops, and their Patriarch in Councils; and proportionably rather more than in other Countries, were Chriſtians there.

               <p n="1">1. I Beſeech you therefore brethren by the mercies of God, that ye preſent your bodies a living Sacrifice, holy, acceptable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, which is your reaſonable ſervice.</p>
               <p rend="small">1. Now to make Application of all this Doctrine fore-written, I beſeech you, as you have a due ſenſe of Chriſt's offering himſelf a Sacrifice for our Sins, and of the great Mercy of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> Salvation by Grace, and of our deliverance from the Burdens of the Jewiſh Law, thoſe coſtly Sacrifices of Beaſts being abrogated by Chriſt, that you will reſign and dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate your ſelves to God, and as a living holy Sacrifice, give up your own Bodies wholly to him, even to the Obedience of his Commands, and to ſuffer what he calls you to, even to death, which will be better than a Sacrifice of Beaſts, even a reaſonable, holy, accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Service of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And be not conformed to this world, but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good, and acceptable and perfect will of God.</p>
               <p rend="small">2. And now you are called out of the World, and made a Peculiar People to God, conform not your ſelves to the ſinful Practices of the World; but be transform'd from your former Errours and Sins, by the renewing of your Minds by Truth and Holineſs; that you may know by experience the Goodneſs of God's Ways, to which you are called, and the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Love.</p>
               <p n="3">3. For I ſay, through the grace given unto me to every Man that is among you, not to think of himſelf more highly than he ought to think, but to think ſoberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the meaſure of faith.</p>
               <p rend="small">3. And ſpecially becauſe that the proud over-valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Mens own Underſtandings, and thinking that they know more than they do, is the common Cauſe of Errours and Sins, of Cenſures, Diviſions, and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies in the Churches, I do, as an Apoſtle ſent and taught of God, admoniſh and charge you all, every one to think humbly of himſelf, and not to think your ſelves wiſer or better than you are; but with wiſe ſelf-ſuſpicion, and conſciouſneſs of your Ignorance and great Imperfection, to think ſoberly of your ſelves, according to truth, and to the degree of Faith and Wiſdom given you of God.</p>
               <p>4, 5. For as we have many members in one body, and all members have not the ſame Office; ſo we being many are one bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in Chriſt, and every one members one of another.</p>
               <p rend="small">4, 5. For as the Members of the ſame Body have great diverſity in Number and Office; ſo we, though many individual Perſons, make up one Body or Church, in Chriſt the Head, in whom we are united, and are related to each other as Members of the ſame Body.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Having then gifts, differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecie, let us prophecie according to the proportion of faith. 7. Or miniſtry, let us wait on our miniſtring, or he that teacheth on teaching.</p>
               <p rend="small">6, 7. Seeing it pleaſeth God to give various de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Gifts, according to the diſpenſation of his Free Grace, and not to make all equal in Gifts or

Let thoſe that are called to any Special Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice for the Church, perform their own Office faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully therein: And let thoſe that are called to teach, be faithful Teachers. Neglect not your own part, and invade not others.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Or he that exhorteth on exhortation: He that giveth, let him do it with ſimplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: He that ruleth, with diligence: He that ſheweth mercy, with chearfulneſs.</p>
               <p rend="small">8. He that is to exhort Men to practiſe what is taught, let him do it diligently, (for Mens corrupt Wills and Affections have need of excitation and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion, as well as their Underſtandings of Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.) He that giveth, (his own, or the Churches) let him do it ſincerely and impartially. He that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted to govern Chruch or Family, let him do it carefully, and diligently. He that ſheweth Mercy to any in diſtreſs, let him do it chearfully.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Let love be without diſſimulation: Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor that which is evil, cleave to that which is good.</p>
               <p rend="small">9. Let Chriſtian-Love, which is the Great Duty of the Goſpel, be hearty and ſincere, appearing in its Fruits, and not in barren Words alone.

Strive not to be thought wiſeſt or beſt or to be higheſt; nor envy others.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Not ſlothful in buſineſs: Fervent in ſpirit, ſerving the Lord.</p>

               <p n="1">1. LEt every ſoul be ſubject unto the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er powers: For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of God.</p>
               <p rend="small">1. And one of the Duties that are neceſſary to your Peace, and required of God, is your due Subjection to Governours: Take heed therefore of their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion who think, that Chriſt hath ſet us free from Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Government: For God is the God of Order: and as in Natural Effects he uſeth Natural Means, ſo in Politick Government he uſeth Officers. I ſpeak not of meer Strength, but of Authority, or Right to Govern: And as ſubordinate Magiſtrates have no ſuch Power, but what is given them by the Supreme; ſo it is impoſſible that Supreme Rulers on Earth can have true Authority, but what is given them by God, the Univerſal Sovereign; even as impoſſible, as for any Creature to be what it is without a Creator: For of him, and through him, and to him are all things. Even where you muſt not obey a ſinful Command, yet you muſt be ſubject ſtill. None are exempted from this Duty; for Government is the Ordinance of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whoſoever therefore reſiſteth the power, reſiſteth the ordinance of God, and they that reſiſt ſhall receive to themſelves damnation.</p>
               <p rend="small">2. Whoever therefore will not be ſubject to Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Government, but reſiſteth True Authority, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth a needful Ordinance of God, and deſerveth Puniſhment from God and Man.</p>
               <p n="3">3. For rulers are not a terror to good works but to the evil: wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? Do that which is good, and thou ſhalt have praiſe of the ſame.</p>
               <p rend="small">3. For as God is the Ordainer of Government in general, ſo he hath ſpecified their Office, as to the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally neceſſary part, and bound them as his Officers to ſee to the Execution of his Univerſal Laws, as the King binds Juſtices to execute his Laws: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Office and Authority received from God, is not to be Perſecutors, or a Terror to Good Works, but to puniſh the Evil: For God giveth no Authority againſt himſelf, or his Laws. If therefore thou fear this Power given of God, do that which is good, and it will further thy Encouragement and Praiſe. Even Heathens, by ſeeing to the Execution of the Law of Nature, will promote Natural Virtue, and ſuppreſs and puniſh Vice.</p>
               <p n="4">4. For he is the miniſter of God to thee for good: But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the ſword in vain: For he is the miniſter of God, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venger to execute wrath upon him that doth evil.</p>
               <p rend="small">4. And let not bad Mens abuſe of Government make thee think evil of the Office: For they are but God's Servants or Officers, not authoriſed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy and to do miſchief, but to do good, even to ſee to the Execution of God's Laws by their own, and to take care of the Common Welfare. But if thou do evil, fear them; for God hath not entruſted them with the Sword in vain, (much leſs for miſchief.) For they are God's Officers, Revengers of Sin, to execute God's Wrath and Man's on Sinners: And ſo to reſiſt them, is to reſiſt the Officers of God; and to honour and obey them, is to honour and obey God that hath authoriſed them.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Wherefore ye muſt needs be ſubject, not only for wrath, but alſo for conſcience ſake.</p>
               <p rend="small">5. Wherefore you ought to be ſubject (even when you may not obey) not onely for fear of Puniſhment from Man, but in Conſcience of your Duty to God who ordaineth them.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb facs="tcp:66325:165"/>6. For, for this cauſe pay you tribute al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo: for they are Gods miniſters, attending continually upon this very thing.</p>
               <p rend="small">6. Therefore honourable Maintenance and Tribute is their due: For they are God's Servants, whoſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               <p n="7">7. Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute is due, cuſtom to whom cuſtom, fear to whom fear, honour to whom honour.</p>
               <p rend="small">7. I am not perſwading you to own Uſurpation, or to give Men that which is not their due; not yet do I determine among ſeveral Claimers, which is the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme: But that you give all their proper due; Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute, Cuſtom, Fear, and Honour, to every one to whom they are due. And let not Covetouſneſs or Diſobedience hinder you.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law.</p>
               <p rend="small">8. Diſcharge your Debts, and give all Men the due which you owe them, (elſe you are unjuſt, and rob them): Only Love we ſhall ſtill owe to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſhall thus owe it even while we pay it. And to pay this Debt of ſincere Love, is to fulfil all the Law to Man.</p>
               <p n="9">9. For this, Thou ſhalt not commit adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, Thou ſhalt not kill, Thou ſhalt not ſteal, Thou ſhalt not bear falſe witneſs, Thou ſhalt not covet; And if there be any other commandment, it is briefly compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in this ſaying, namely, Thou ſhalt love thy neighbour as thy ſelf.</p>
               <p rend="small">9. For all our Duty to Man is virtually compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in Loving them as our ſelves: For a Man will not wrong the Life, the Eſtate, the Marriage right, the Honour of himſelf, nor falſely accuſe or proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute himſelf, or covet from himſelf, or thoſe that he loveth as himſelf. Bring Men once to this unfeigned Love, and Hurtfulneſs, Covetouſneſs, Fraud, Falſe Accuſation, Perſecution, and all Injuſtice, will ceaſe.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love is the fulfilling of the law.</p>
               <p rend="small">10. As we are not apt to hurt our ſelves, ſo true Love would not hurt others, in their Lives, Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Eſtates, or Good Names, (much leſs ſtudy to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy them.) Therefore Love is the virtual fulfilling of all our Duty to them.</p>
               <p n="11">11. And that knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake out of ſleep: for now is our ſalvation nearer than when we believed.</p>
               <p rend="small">11. And we ſhould increaſe in this careful diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of our Duty of Love and Juſtice, though in the State of Infidelity we lived in ſuch Sins: For by this time we ſhould be better acquainted with our Duties, and awaked to all conſcionable performance of them, we being neerer our Reward and Salvation than when we were firſt converted to the Faith; and God expecteth now more from us.</p>
               <p n="12">12. The night is far ſpent, the day is at hand: Let us therefore caſt off the works of darkneſs, &amp; let us put on the armour of light.</p>
               <p rend="small">12. We are now got further from our former State of Darkneſs: We are now come to the Day-light of Illuminating Grace, and under the Increaſe thereof. The Church is growing to a more Honourable State by its Increaſe. Let us therefore more reſolvedly caſt off all the Works of Heatheniſh Darkneſs, and, as Chriſt's Soldiers, put on our Sacred Armour, and uſe it as in the Day-light of Grace.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Let us walk honeſtly as in the day; not in rioting and drunkenneſs, not in cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bering and wantonneſs, not in ſtrife and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vying.</p>

                  <p>Qu. III. <hi>Is no Power to do wrong ordained of God? Or is all ſuch ordained by him? Anſ. Power</hi> here being Right to Govern, no Man hath Right to do Wrong, that's a Contradiction: But God hath ordained that Right which may be abuſed to do Wrong, and yet not reſiſted.</p>
                  <p>Qu. IV. <hi>What's meant by</hi> Subjection? <hi>Anſ.</hi> A State of Conſent and Obligation to obey. Obedience is the Practice of Subjection.</p>
                  <p>Qu. V. <hi>Hath the</hi> Univerſal [every Soul] <hi>no Exception? Anſ.</hi> The Higher Powers themſelves are excepted: And neither Foreigners, nor thoſe that have no Governours, are bound to be ſubject to other Princes: It is only their own Subjects that are meant. And the Pope could have no pretence to except his Clergy, if he did not feign himſelf to be the Higheſt Power over them, and above their Kings and States?</p>
                  <p>Qu. VI. <hi>Is</hi> Obedience <hi>to go as far as Subjection? Anſ.</hi> No: We muſt not obey any by disobeying God: But yet we muſt continue Subjection and Due honour to them, and not deny them their due, becauſe we muſt not give them more by Sin.</p>
                  <p>Qu. <hi>What then are the Limits of our Obedience to Men? Anſ.</hi> 1. <hi>Materially,</hi> we muſt not obey any by Sin, nor yet againſt the Common Good, to do more hurt than good, when they command without due Power or Right. 2. As to formal Obedience, (which is to act by the Obligation of their Authority) the Limits of their Power are the Limits of that Obligation and Obedience.</p>
                  <p>Qu. <hi>What are the Limits of their Power? Anſ.</hi> In general, they have no more from God than he giveth them 1. They have no Power againſt any of his Laws, of Nature or Scripture, nor againſt his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, or himſelf. 2. They have no Right or Power to overthrow Perſonal, or Family, or Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; nor to deprive any of any thing which God hath given them, without forfeiture or Conſent, expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit or implicit; nor to deſtroy the Common Good.</p>
                  <p>2. Therefore that <hi>Propriety</hi> which God hath given Man as Man, (in Life, and Limbs, and the uſe of his Faculties for his Welfare and his Duty to God, and his Wife and Children) are ſuch objective Limitations of this Power, that no Man hath Right to take them from any, but on Forfeiture, or valid Conſent.</p>
                  <p>Qu. VII. <hi>How far is all Power of God, and how far of Men? Anſ.</hi> 1. It is of God's Ordination in Nature, That there be Government and Subjection in general. 2. And the Specification is ſo far of God, that he hath made them his Officers: 1. To promote Obedience to his own Law: 2. For his Glory, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Good. So that no People can make a Power that ſhall not have Right to promote God's Law; 2. or that ſhall deſtroy the Common Good. 3. God's Providence doth ſo manage the Affairs of the World, as ſhall point out the Man or Families that the People ſhould accept of firſt while free, as qualified by Strength, Wiſdom and Goodneſs, for Authority. 4. Monarchy and Ariſtocracy <hi>in ſpecie</hi> are both of Divine Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance.</p>
                  <p>2. But it is of Men, 1. Which of theſe ſorts (Monarchy, or Ariſtocracy, or Mixt) ſhall by a Free People be choſen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And what degree of Power they ſhall have over their <hi>Proprieties</hi> (which are antecedent to Regiment) in undetermined Caſes. So that Government is partly from God, and partly from Man.</p>
                  <p>Qu. VIII. <hi>By what Right doth one Perſon or Family claim it before all others. Anſ.</hi> The foregoing Words de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide this. 1. Not by meer Worth, Wit, or Vertue: For theſe may be without ſuch Authority. 2. Not by meer Strength or Conqueſt: For then every Rebel, or Foreign Prince, that can conquer Kings, will have the Right; which would tempt them to attempt ſuch Conqueſt. 3. Not every Conqueſt made juſt by ſome Injury; For that giveth Right but to Repriſal or Damages, and over the Injurers: And all Wars uſually are on Pretence of Right. 4. Not a Succeſſion of Primogeniture from <hi>Noah,</hi> nor from the firſt founding of the Commonwealth: This is not neceſſary: Nor may any rebell againſt all the Kings on Earth, if they can but diſprove ſuch an uninterrupted Succeſſion of Primogeniture: Elſe Kings were dangerouſly expoſed. 5. Nor is Revelation from Heaven neceſſary to notifie the Perſon: For who but Fanaticks now pretend to that? I know therefore no remaining Title, but <hi>Mutual Conſent (free or forced) of Perſons made capable by the Providence of God, at the forming of the Government.</hi>

                  <p>Qu. X. <hi>What is meant by</hi> Reſiſtance? <hi>Anſ.</hi> Not only Fighting againſt them, but all that is contrary to Subjection and due Obedience: But moſt eminently Libertiniſm, which pretendeth, that God hath freed Chriſtians from Subjection.</p>
                  <p>Qu. XI. <hi>How doth the Deſcription</hi> verſe 3. <hi>agree with Heathens and Perſecutors? Are they none of God's Miniſters who are a Terror to Good Works?

<pb facs="tcp:66325:166"/>
Terror to ſome particular Good Works, not eſſential to the End of the Office, and that through Errour, may yet be againſt Vice, and for Goodneſs, in the main. And a Heathen may execute the Law of Nature, and, ſo far be for the Common Good. But Perſecuting the Juſt is no exerciſe of the Divine Miniſtry or Power.</p>
                  <p>Qu. XI. Verſe 5. <hi>How is Conſcience bound by Mans Laws? Anſ.</hi> All Men muſt be conſcious of God's Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations on them, to obey the Juſt Laws of Men.</p>
                  <p>Qu. XII. Verſe 6, 7. <hi>May we give none mere Tribute, Cuſtom, Fear, or Honour, than their due? And are all Judges of the Princes due? Anſ.</hi> All is not due that may be claimed: Materially Men may, for their own Safety and juſt Ends, give Rulers or others more than their due, or which they have right to: But as <hi>formal Obedience</hi> or <hi>Juſtice</hi> we are not bound to give any one more than his due. And of this we are <hi>Diſcerners,</hi> though not deciding Publick Judges: But miſ-judging will excuſe no Injury.</p>

And to promiſe or borrow what we know we cannot pay, or when we acquaint not the Lender with the weakneſs and doubtfulneſs of our Eſtate, that the hazard may be by his own coſent, is to defraud him, and is a Stealing of one of the worſt ſorts.</p>

               <p n="4">4. Who art thou that judgeſt another mans ſervant? To his own maſter he ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth or falleth: Yea, he ſhall be holden up, for God is able to make him ſtand.</p>
               <p rend="small">4. Doſt thou know thy ſelf while thou ſo judgeſt others? Who art thou, a ſinful man, that thou pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumeſt to judge and condemn Gods Servants? It is his Sentence and not thine to which they ſhall ſtand or fall, as juſtified or condemned: and theſe diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences ſhall not hinder God's acceptance of him and his Salvation: for God that is juſt and merciful can juſtifie, confirm, and ſave him.</p>
               <p n="5">5. One man eſteemeth one day above ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: another eſteemerh every day alike: Let every man be fully perſwaded in his own mind.</p>
               <p rend="small">5. So one Man makes Conſcience to keep the Jewiſh Feaſts and Faſts: Another knoweth that Chriſt hath abrogated them. Let every one labour as well as he can to know God's Will, and then be true to his upright Conſcience; as knowing that he may not in theſe things follow the judgment of others againſt his own, which he thinks is according to the mind of God, whom he intendeth herein to obey.</p>
               <p n="6">6. He that regardeth a day, regardeth it unto the Lord, and he that regardeth not the day, to the Lord be doth not regard it: He that eateth eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God thanks, and he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks.</p>
               <p rend="small">6. He that maketh Conſcience to keep ſuch Days, and not ſo to eat, he intendeth it as an Act of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to God; and ſo doth he that is contrarily minded; and both of them pray for Gods acceptance, and give him thanks: And dare you for ſuch things diſcourage or reject Men, that as they are able ſtudy to pleaſe God: Is pleaſing God ſo light in your eſteem.</p>
               <p n="7">7. For none of us liveth to himſelf, and no man dieth to himſelf.</p>
               <p rend="small">
                  <pb facs="tcp:66325:167"/>7. For we are all convinced that we are not our own, and therefore may not do what we liſt our ſelves, and fit our practice to carnal ſelf-intereſts, but to the pleaſing of the Will of God; as all Men die at his Will and into his Hands, and not their own.</p>
               <p n="8">8. For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; or whether we die, we die unto the Lord: Whether we live therefore or die, we are the Lords.</p>
               <p rend="small">8. For our lives are of God, and muſt be for him to do his Will, and when we die, his Will therein is done, in which we muſt contentedly acquieſce: For living and dying we are his.</p>
               <p n="9">9. For to this end Chriſt both died, and roſe, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living.</p>
               <p rend="small">9. For this being the very end of Chriſts dying, riſing and reviving, that he might be Lord of all both dead and living, who ſhall preſume to take the governing or judging power out of his Hands, and take Mens Souls and Conſciences from ſubjection to him, and expect to be obeyed or pleaſed before him?</p>
               <p n="10">10. But why doſt thou judge thy brother? Or, why doſt thou ſet at nought thy bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? For we ſhall all ſtand before the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſeat of Chriſt.</p>
               <p rend="small">10. Why then doth one Party call their Brethren ſinners, or prophane, for not being againſt ſuch law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful things as they call unlawful: And why do the other part vilifie their Brethren for Conſcionable ſcrupling and avoiding ſuch a lawful thing. Do you not all know our common imperfection of Knowledge, and that we have no authority for ſuch Judgment or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt? And are you not afraid thus to uſurp the Judgment which belongs to Chriſt, and fear leſt he will judge you for your uncharitableneſs to his Servants.</p>
               <p n="11">11, 12. For it is written, As I live, ſaith the Lord, every knee ſhall bow to me, and every tongue ſhall confeſs to God. So then every one of us ſhall give account of himſelf to God.</p>
               <p rend="small">11, 12. God hath told us in his Word that he will be firſt obeyed and pleaſed before all Men: It is he that is our ſupreme abſolute Lord; and to him we muſt all give our great account, and from him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive our final doom: And would you wiſh any then to obey or humour you, when he is perſwaded that it diſpleaſeth God, and would condemn him? Or will you anticipate God's Judgment, and tempt Men out of the fear of ſinning by your fallible cenſures or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt?</p>
               <p n="13">13. Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge this rather, that no man put a ſtumbling block, or an occaſion to fall in his brothers way.</p>
               <p rend="small">13. Let not us therefore (Paſtors or Neighbours) thus uncharitably judge or uſe each other, for ſuch tolerable differences in things that are done Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly as for God: But inſtead of this diſcouraging Conſcience, and the fear of ſin, let this be your true Judgment, that no Man (Clergy or Lay) do either by Command or his own practice, put a Stumbling-block, Scandal, or occaſion of ſinning or hurt in his Brothers way, pretending the lawfulneſs of the thing, or his own authority to impoſe it: Souls muſt not be ſo driven upon ſin.</p>
               <p n="14">14. I know, and am perſwaded by the Lord Jeſus, that there is nothing unclean of it ſelf; but to him that eſteemeth any thing to be unclean, to him it is unclean.</p>
               <p rend="small">14. I (that am an Apoſtle, and therefore want not Knowledge, nor Authority to command what ſhould be commanded in ſuch caſes,) do know and am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded in and by the Lord Jeſus, that none of the Meats counted unclean and avoided by the Jewiſh Chriſtians, are unlawful in themſelves, and that they miſtake that think otherwiſe. But it is unclean, and unlawful to him that thinks it ſo, (or elſe Men muſt do that which they think God forbideth, which were formal diſobedience to him.)</p>
               <p n="15">15. But if thy brother be grieved with thy meat, now walkeſt thou not charitably: Deſtroy not him with thy meat for whom Chriſt died. 16. Let not then your good be evil ſpoken of.</p>
               <p rend="small">15, 16. But if by thy unneceſſary practice of an indifferent lawful thing (and much more if by thy compulſion) thy miſtaken Brother be hurt and gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and diſcouraged in Religion, now thou art guilty of the great ſin of uncharitableneſs, when he was guilty but of a pardonable unwilling miſtake: And ſee to it, that thou do not thus by (the practice or urging of) thy things indifferent deſtroy him for whom Chriſt died, by drawing or driving him to that which to him is ſin: Chriſt purchaſed Souls by a dearer price than things indifferent. It's good in you to know more than he, and lawful to uſe ſuch Meats as he ſcrupleth: But turn not your Knowledge into a ſcandal, and offence, and miſchief.</p>
               <p n="17">17. For the Kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteouſneſs and peace, and joy in the holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p rend="small">17. For it is not every lawful indifferent thing, (no nor every truth or ſmaller duty) which Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Salvation, and right to our Love and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion lieth on: Theſe are not eſſential to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable Subjects of Chriſts Kingdom: Think not ſo unworthily of him that came to free us from the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaical Ceremonies, that he hath made ſuch things as theſe the neceſſary terms of Love and Communion in his Church. But it is in Righteouſneſs before God and Man, and in the Love and Practice of Peace with all, and in the joyful ſenſe of the love of God and hope of Glory ſhed abroad on our Hearts by the Holy Ghoſt, taking pleaſure to help and comfort our Brethren in the way to Heaven. This is Chriſtianity.</p>
               <p n="18">
                  <pb facs="tcp:66325:167"/>18. For he that in theſe things ſerveth Chriſt is acceptable to God and approved of men.</p>
               <p rend="small">18. For notwithſtanding ſuch difference in leſſer things, he that is ſuch a one, and in theſe things ſincerely ſerveth Chriſt, is acceptable to God, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever cenſure him, deſpiſe him, or excommunicate him; and he is approved of Wiſe and Charitable Men, and is one whoſe Life, even the Natural Conſcience of Men will ſecretly be forced to approve, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn them that condemn and vilifie him.</p>
               <p n="19">19. Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace, and things wherewith one may edifie another.</p>
               <p rend="small">19. Inſtead therefore of Excommunicating, Abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing or Deſpiſing one another for ſuch Ceremonies, or ſmall differences as theſe, if we are Chriſtians, let us lay by theſe matters of contention, and earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly purſue the things that make for the Common Peace of all Chriſtians, though thus differing, and the things by which we may further each others Edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Salvation, and not obtrude our own Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or things unneceſſary, to the hurt of others, and diviſion of the Church.</p>
               <p n="20">20. For meat deſtroy not the work of God: All things indeed are pure; but it is evil for that man who eateth with offence.</p>
               <p rend="small">20. Obtrude not your ſcrupled Meat, or Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, or ſmall things, to the deſtroying of Men's Souls by driving or drawing them to ſin. All ſuch indifferent things are pure to the pure; but it is your ſin if you uſe them (much more if you impoſe them) to the ſcandal, offence, or hurt of others.</p>
               <p n="21">21. It is good neither to eat fleſh, nor to drink wine, nor any thing whereby thy bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtumbleth or is offended, or is made weak.</p>
               <p rend="small">21. It is thy duty to forbear even Fleſh and Wine when they are not neceſſary, if the uſe of them will occaſion ſin or more hurt to thy Brother than good to thee; much more to avoid obtruding thy indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent things on him who takes them to be ſins.</p>
               <p n="22">22. Haſt thou faith? Have it to thy ſelf before God. Happy is he that condemneth not himſelf in that thing which he alloweth.</p>
               <p rend="small">22. Haſt thou more Knowledge than he, to believe thoſe things to be lawful, which he judgeth ſin. Keep thy knowledge and belief to thy ſelf, to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie thy Judgment to God: but uſe it not to the hurt of others. Happy is he that uſeth not his Knowledge of good and evil to his own condemnation. It's a ſad kind of Knowledge which is uſed to deſtroy others, and condemn thy ſelf.</p>
               <p n="23">23. And he that doubteth is damned if he eat, becauſe he eateth not of faith: for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is not of faith is ſin.</p>

               <p n="2">2, 3. Let every one of us pleaſe his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for his good to edification: For even Chriſt pleaſed not himſelf: but as it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, The reproaches of them that reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thee fell on me.</p>
               <p rend="small">2, 3.

                     <hi>ANNOTATIONS</hi> on the former Chapter, and this.</head>
                  <p>THe Subject of the former Chapter is handled on thus far, and here that Chapter ſhould have ended. He that underſtandeth the former and preſent State of the Chriſtian Churches, and the Pride and Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to which Man is liable, will eaſily perceive, that it was not in vain that the Spirit of God did by the Apoſtle handle and decide this Caſe, of receiving Diſſenters in tollerable Caſes into Love and Communion. The <hi>Jews</hi> were ſo tied up from Legiſlation in God's Matters, by the knowledge of God's Prerogative in their Theocracy, that they had leſs room for the Canons and Engines of Mans making to exerciſe their Pride and Uncharitableneſs by, than the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> have ſince done. And yet the <hi>Phariſees</hi> plaid their part, and by their Traditions made void the Law of God, and preferr'd their Ceremonies before the weighty Matters of the Law, and would not underſtand what that meaneth, <hi>I will have mercy, and not ſacrifice</hi>; and thereby did condemn the guiltleſs. And Chriſt found the <hi>Samaritans</hi> and <hi>Jews</hi> at the Debate, <hi>Whether in this Mountain, or at Jeruſalem, men ought to worſhip?</hi> overlooking that <hi>Worſhip</hi> which is <hi>in Spirit and in Truth.</hi> And, alas! what work have Domination, unneceſſary Canons and Cenſures made in the Chriſtian Churches theſe 1300 years? And it is an Inſtance what power Blindneſs, and Prejudice, and Worldly Intereſt have, to fruſtrate the plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Deciſions of God's Word, that ſo full and expreſs a Deciſion as theſe two Chapters make, (with 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. and <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. and <hi>James</hi> 3.) hath ſignified as little with the Dividers and Proud, almoſt as if there had been no ſuch written. And yet ſuch Men call for a Judge of Controverſies, becauſe of the pretended Obſcurity of the Scriptures, when nothing can be plainer than this, which they deſpiſe. They mean, that ſuch as they muſt be Judges, and God ſhall make the Words, if they may make the Senſe.</p>
                  <p>How great is the number that go on the two ſides of Uncharitableneſs here reproved; eſpecially on that which is largelieſt inſiſted on? One ſide ſaith, All God's Truths are precious, and none muſt be ſold for Peace; and we muſt not partake of other Mens Sins: As if our great Duty of Love, Forbearance, and Communion, were our Sin, or a partaking of the Faults of all that we joyn with. The other Side pretend, 1. That <hi>Paul</hi> only requireth Forbearance in things Indifferent, undetermined by Governours, and not after ſuch a Command or Determination. 2. Or, that he giveth only a Temporary Rule for the preſent Concord of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> till the ſetled Church ſhould take a contrary Courſe.</p>
                  <p>I will not here anſwer theſe at large, having done it in my Book called <hi>The only Way of the Churches Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord</hi>: But I ſay, That I deſpair of reducing that Man to the Truth herein, who ſhall continue of either of theſe Opinions, after he hath ſeriouſly peruſed the Text, and hath conſidered, 1. That St. <hi>Paul</hi> here uſeth, I think, above twenty Arguments, from Morality and common Chriſtian Duty, which he would not do for a mutable Caſe, which Biſhops may change when they will. 2 That <hi>Rome</hi> was then a famous Church, and therefore had Paſtors, or one at leaſt; and that he writeth to the whole Church, and therefore to the Paſtors: And ſure he never meant, [<hi>The Clergy ſhall receive ſuch Diſſenters to Communion, and neither by Canon or Practice caſt them out, till they think meet to do otherwiſe, and till have made ſuch Canons.] Paul</hi> doth not ſo play with Contradictions, in ſo long and grave a Reprehenſion. 3. That St. <hi>Paul</hi> oft puts himſelf in, as under the ſame Obligation with the reſt: And if an Apoſtle called from Heaven may not do what's here forbidden, what Biſhops can prete<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But they that have not known the Way of Peace, may ſay ſomething againſt the fulleſt and plaineſt Deſcription of it, and the ſharpeſt Reproofs of God himſelf. But he will expound theſe Chapters to their Conſciences, if ever he make them Healers of his Church.</p>
                  <p>As to thoſe that ſay, It is not Church-Communion that <hi>Paul</hi> here ſpeaks of; I refer them to the plain Text, and Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi>'s Annotations, which they value. The God of Love and Peace hath given Laws for Love and Peace, ſo ſtrict, and full, and clear, that all World may ſee, that it is not he that allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Canons or Cenſures which have ſo long torn the Churches.</p>

The Occaſion of writing this, is of nearer concern to be known, for the underſtanding of it.

But as to the <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Manner</hi> of his Writing, the Caſe of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> was the Occaſion. 1.

            <p>2. There were many Scandals among them, which he endeavoureth to heal by convincing Reproof; as, 1. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

than they had. 3. Hearkning to envious Teachers, that villified him, and defamed his Perſon and Miniſtry. 4. The favouring of Inceſt and Scandal, and neglect of Diſcipline. 5. Going to Law againſt one another, and that before Heathen Judges, when they ſhould have decided their Differences by amicable Arbitration. 6. Defrauding and wronging one another. 7. Too eaſie Thoughts of Fornication. 8. Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous eating things offered to Idols. 9. Too much backwardneſs to maintain the Miniſters, and the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of their Work. 10. Prophane Diſorder at their Love-Feaſts and Sacrament, even to partiality, and Exceſs of Drink, and ſcandalous Unreverence, for which God punihſed ſome in the Fleſh. 11. Overvaluing Gifts, and undervaluing lower Chriſtians that wanted them; as not enough ſenſible of the Neceſſity and Extent of Chriſtian Unity. 12. Diſorder in their Sacred Aſſemblies in the Exerciſe of their Gifts. 13. Some erring about and againſt the Reſurrection, and others too much hearkning to them.</p>
            <p>Theſe things <hi>Paul</hi> reproveth, and blameth them for not reforming; but perſuadeth none to ſeparate from that Church for all theſe Corruptions. But by this we may know what muſt be expected from young un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skillful Chriſtians; and what Faults will be in ſuch Churches as ours, though the Paſtors were the beſt, when the Churches were ſo faulty in the Apoſtles Time and Preſence; and how far they are from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolick Spirit, Skill, Love, and Lenity, who would Excommunicate all as intollerable Schiſmaticks, who Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form not to all their deviſed unneceſſary Additions, and dare not ſubſcribe their Juſtification or Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all their Forms.

               <p n="1">1. PAul called to be an apoſtle of Jeſus Chriſt, through the will of God, and Softhenes our Brother, 2. Unto the church of God which is at Corinth, to them that are ſanctified in Chriſt Jeſus, called to be ſaints, with all that in every place call upon the name of Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, both theirs and ours.</p>
               <p rend="small">1, 2. <hi>Paul</hi> a called Apoſtle by the ſpecial Electing Will and Favour of God, and Brother <hi>Soſthenes</hi>; To the Church of God at <hi>Corinth,</hi> being ſanctified to God in Chriſt, and ſo are called Saints; with all ſuch as faithfully call on the Name of Chriſt, our common Lord.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Grace be unto you, and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p rend="small">3. I wiſh the great Bleſſings of Grace and Peace, inward and outward Welfare, from God the Fountain of all Good, and Jeſus Chriſt the Mediator and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of all to us.</p>
               <p n="4">4. I thank my God always on your behalf, for the grace of God which is given you by Jeſus Chriſt. 5. That in every thing ye are enriched by him in all utterance and in all knowledge, 6. Even as the teſtimony of Chriſt was confirmed in you. 7. So that ye come behind in no gift, waiting for the coming of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p rend="small">4, 5, 6, 7. I am thankful for what you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that you abound in the Gifts of Utterance and Knowledge, as among you the Goſpel of Chriſt was confirmed to you by the Miraculous Gifts of the Spirit, which you ſaw and received, ſo that you have attained to ſuch an Eminency, as fitteth you for the Perfection of all at the coming of Chriſt, which you hope and wait for.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Who ſhall alſo confirm you unto the end, that you may be blameleſs in the day of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p rend="small">8. Who will not deny you his Confirming Grace, that you may be found holy and juſtifiable at that day.</p>
               <p n="9">9. God is faithful by whom ye were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led into the fellowſhip of his ſon Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>
               <p rend="small">9. For God is faithful, who freely called you to the State of Communion with and in Chriſt, when you were Aliens to it, and therefore will not fail you when you are called and reconciled.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Now I beſeech you brethren by the name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that ye all ſpeak the ſame thing, and that there be no diviſions among you; but that ye be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly joyned together in the ſame mind, and in the ſame judgment. 11. For it hath been declared unto me of you, my brethren,
<pb facs="tcp:66325:171"/>
by them which are of the houſe of Cloe, that there are contentions among you.</p>
               <p rend="small">10, 11. But notwithſtanding all your Gifts, I find cauſe to beſeech you, even by the Authority and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Name of Chriſt, that you will take heed of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, Sidings, and Contentions, and be as one in Mind and Judgment. For I have been credibly told of your Contentions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p rend="small">
                  <hi>Note,</hi> 1. That Churches and Perſons of eminent Gifts may be liable to ſinful Diviſions and Strife. 2. That Unity and Concord muſt improve all our Gifts, if we would have them profit our ſelves and others. 3. Therefore it muſt be in the Neceſſary things that we muſt unite, and be of the ſame Mind and Judgment, and not in things Doubtful and Unneceſſary: elſe it would be as vain, as to beſeech them to be all Men of Learning or higheſt Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Now this I ſay, that every one of you ſaith, I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas, and I of Chriſt.</p>
               <p rend="small">12. I hear that you name your ſelves as the Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers or Party of this or that Man, as if you ſet your Teachers and their Doctrine againſt one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and even Chriſt againſt his Miniſters.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Is Chriſt divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized in the name of Paul?</p>
               <p rend="small">13. Will ye make Chriſt, who is our common Head and Saviour, to be the Head of a Faction? Or will you ſet <hi>Paul</hi> againſt Chriſt? As if <hi>Paul</hi> had been cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified for you, or you baptiſed into his Name? Know ye not that we have no Head of the Church but Chriſt?</p>
               <p n="14">14. I thank God that I baptized none of you but Criſpus and Gaius: 15. Leſt any ſhould ſay that I had baptized in mine own name. 16. And I baptized alſo the houſhold of Stephanus: beſides I know not whether I baptized any other.</p>
               <p rend="small">14, 15, 16. Though Baptizing be Chriſt's Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, I thank God that he ſo over-ruled my Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that I baptiſed none of you, but <hi>Criſpus</hi> and <hi>Gaius,</hi> and the Houſhold of <hi>Stephanus,</hi> but that it was done by others, becauſe thereby I have eſcaped this Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal, which might have done more harm, than my Baptiſing would have done good.</p>
               <p rend="small">
                  <hi>Note,</hi> That as <hi>Abraham</hi> and others were to bring all their Houſholds with them into the Covenant, who were their own, and not free Servants; ſo were thoſe that had Houſholds bound to bring all their own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Gods Covenant, as far as they were able.</p>
               <p n="17">17. For Chriſt ſent me not to baptize, but to preach the Goſpel: not with wiſdom of words, leſt the croſs of Chriſt ſhould be made of none effect.</p>
               <p rend="small">17. For though Baptizing be within my Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, it was not that, but Preaching the Goſpel to convert Souls to Chriſt, that I was moſt expreſly and principally commiſſioned to: And that not by ſuch Humane Arts of Philoſophy and Oratory as now paſs for Wiſdom, leſt theſe ſhould carry the Praiſe from the Doctrine, Croſs, and Miracles which Chriſt doth work by, to convert the World.</p>
               <p rend="small">Note, how groſly they err, that ſay, That God converteth and giveth Grace by Sacraments only, or rather than by Preaching.</p>
               <p n="18">18. For the Preaching of the croſs is to them that periſh, fooliſhneſs: but unto us which are ſaved, it is the power of God.</p>
               <p rend="small">18. For to them that thus paſs for Wiſe Men in the World, but are unſaved and periſh in their Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, it ſeemeth great Folly to truſt in a Crucified Chriſt for Salvation, and ſuffer for him: But the Power and Wiſdom of God are this way eminently manifeſted to us, who have felt its ſaving Efficacy on our ſelves, and ſhall be ſaved by it.</p>
               <p n="19">19. For it is written, I will deſtroy the wiſdom of the wiſe; and will bring to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing the underſtanding of the prudent.</p>
               <p rend="small">19. For God, who is againſt the Pride of Man, did propheſie, That he would fruſtrate the Carnal Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of ungodly Men, ſaying, <hi>I will deſtroy, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="20">20. Where is the wiſe? where is the ſcribe? where is the diſputer of this world? Hath not God made fooliſh the wiſdom of this world?</p>
               <p rend="small">20. Doth not the Goſpel of a Crucified Chriſt now vanquiſh and ſhame the Learned Philoſophy and Oratory, Heathen and Jewiſh artificial Learning, counted the chief Wiſdom? And doth it not ſilence and ſhame the wrangling Logicians, and ſhew the Folly and utter Impotency and Vanity of their Learning?</p>
               <p n="21">21. For after that in the wiſdom of God, the world by wiſdom knew not God, it pleaſed God by the fooliſhneſs of preaching to ſave them that believe.</p>
               <p rend="small">21. For when as the World, by Gods wiſe Permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, lived in ſuch Ignorance, that they had not the Practical Knowledge of the True God, but diſobeyed him, and worſhipped Idols, it pleaſed God by that Preaching of Chriſt which they count Fooliſhneſs, to convert and ſave Believers, and do that which all their Learning could not do.</p>
               <p n="22">22. The Jews require a ſign, and the Greeks ſeek after wiſdom: 23. But we preach Chriſt crucified; unto the Jews a ſtumbling-block, and unto the Greeks foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhneſs; 24. But unto them which are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, both Jews and Greeks, Chriſt the power of God, and the wiſdom of God.</p>
               <p rend="small">22, 23, 24. For beſides all the Miracles and Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
<pb facs="tcp:66325:171"/>
of Chriſt, the <hi>Jews</hi> require ſome Sign from Heaven, to prove to them that Chriſt was ſent from God: And the <hi>Greeks</hi> look for eminent Learning to prove it, (ſome eminent Learning in Philoſophy, Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick, or Oratory.) But we, that convert and ſave the World, do it by preaching Salvation by a Crucified Chriſt, though it be to the <hi>Jews</hi> a Scandal which they cannot receive, and to <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſeeming Folly: But to them that are converted and ſaved by it, Chriſt is the Power and the Wiſdom of God.</p>
               <p n="25">25. Becauſe the fooliſhneſs of God is wiſer then men, and the weakneſs of God is ſtronger then men.</p>
               <p rend="small">25. For that of God which Men count Fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Weakneſs, and deride, doth overcome their pretended Wiſdom and Strength, and do that which they cannot do, and proveth them to be but Folly and Weakneſs.</p>
               <p n="26">26<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For ye ſee your calling, brethren, how that not many wiſe men after the fleſh, not many mighty, not many noble are called.</p>
               <p rend="small">26. As Chriſtianity is the true Wiſdom, you ſee by experience, that not many Learned Men, or Great Men that rule in the World, or Noble Men that abound in Wealth, Pleaſures, and Honour, become Chriſtians.</p>
               <p n="27">27. But God hath choſen the fooliſh things of the world, to confound the wiſe; and God hath choſen the weak things of the world, to confound the things which are mighty, 28. And baſe things of the world, and things which are deſpiſed, hath God cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, yea, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are; 29. That no fleſh ſhould glory in his preſence.</p>
               <p rend="small">27, 28, 29. But it pleaſeth God to chuſe that which the World counts Fooliſh, and Weak, and Baſe, to confound, ſhame, and overcome that which is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted by them Wiſe, and Mighty, and Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and the things which they deſpiſe, God will uſe and honour; yea, by that which ſeemeth nothing to them, or which yet is not in being, to vanquiſh thoſe which ſeem great and real to them; that ſo the Pride of Man may be ſhamed, and the Impotency of Man man feſted, and all Fleſh may be humbled, and driven from their Self-confidence, and none may glory of any thing of his own againſt his Glory.</p>
               <p n="30, 31">30, 31. But of him are ye in Chriſt Jeſus, who of God is made unto us wiſdom, and righteouſneſs, and ſanctification and redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. That according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.</p>
               <p rend="small">30, 31. But it is by his Power and Work that you are made Chriſtians, united to Chriſt, who of God is made to us the Object and Teacher of the trueſt Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; (To know him, and to be taught by him the Great things of Salvation, excelleth all the Heathen Philoſophy.) He is made of God our Righteouſneſs, the Merits of his perfect Righteouſneſs procuring our free Pardon and Adoption, which our Works could not do. He is made our Sanctification, we being purified by vertue of his Sacrifice, and by his Spirit, and by him ſeparated as a Peculiar People to God. And by him it is that we have Redemption and Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance from Sin, and Satan, and the Law, and Death, and Hell: That as it is written, God and not Man may be all our Glorying and Truſt.</p>

               <p n="1">1. ANd I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellency of ſpeech, or of wiſdom, declaring unto you the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of God.</p>
               <p rend="small">1. Accordingly I my ſelf being ſent by Chriſt to preach to the World, did not come to you with the admired Philoſophy and Oratory of the World, in declaring the Goſpel-Myſtery, and Gods Atteſtation of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For I determined not to know any thing among you, ſave Jeſus Chriſt and him cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified.</p>
               <p rend="small">2. For I reſolved to make no Oſtentation of any other Learning, and to teach you no other, than the Knowledge of a Crucified Chriſt, in an humble man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner preached.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And I was with you in weakneſs, and in fear, and in much trembling.</p>
               <p rend="small">3. And accordingly I was humbled among you, by Perſecutions, and Abuſe, and continual Dangers and Sufferings, in conformity to the Croſs of Chriſt, which I preached.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And my ſpeech, and my preaching was not with enticing words of mans wiſdom, but in demonſtration of the ſpirit and of power.</p>
               <p rend="small">4. And my manner of preaching was not by the
<pb facs="tcp:66325:172"/>
witty Inſinuations of Artificial Learning, (Oratory or Logick;) but ſo as did demonſtrate the ſupernatural Gift of the Spirit of God, and in the Power there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, manifeſted by Miracles and Succeſs.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That your faith ſhould not ſtand in the wiſdom of men, but in the power of God.</p>
               <p rend="small">5. That your Faith, the Effect, which will be like its Cauſe and Motives, might not be meerly Humane, founded on and reſolved into the Art of the Speaker; but Divine, grounded on and reſolved into the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Divine Revelation and Authority.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Howbeit we ſpeak wiſdom among them that are perfect: yet not the wiſdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to nought.</p>
               <p rend="small">6. Yet we are not without uſeful Learning, and ſublimity and accurateneſs of Speech; but uſe ſuch with thoſe that are knowing and capable of it: But not the vain and frothy Learning which is now moſt applauded in the World by Men of Name and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, which periſheth as a Bubble, and ſaveth not them that have it.</p>
               <p n="7">7. But we ſpeak the wiſdom of God in a myſtery, even the hidden wiſdom which God ordained before the world unto our glory.</p>
               <p rend="small">7. But we ſpeak the Myſtery of Redemption, the Product and Diſcovery of the Wiſdom of God, which hath been kept in much darkneſs, and little known, but ordained before the World was to be opened in the fulneſs of time to our Glory.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Which none of the princes of this world knew: For had they known it they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.</p>
               <p rend="small">8. Which none of the Rulers of this Age of the World knew; elſe they had not crucified Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. But as it is written, Eye hath not ſeen, nor ear heard, neither have entred into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.</p>
               <p rend="small">9. For the great Gifts of Gods Grace, decreed and prepared for all that love him, are ſuch as Man ſeeth not, and hardly believeth, and cannot compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend: As it is written, <hi>Eye hath not ſeen, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. But God hath revealed them unto us by his ſpirit, for the ſpirit ſearcheth all things, yea the deep things of God.</p>
               <p rend="small">10. But God by his Spirit hath revealed them to us his Apoſtles (and to others that have his Spirit in the meaſure that they have it): For the Spirit of God is given us (in our ſeveral meaſures) to teach us all things fit for us to know, even the Depths of God.</p>
               <p n="11">11. For what man knoweth the things of a man, ſave the ſpirit of man which is in him? even ſo the things of God knoweth no man, but the ſpirit of God.</p>
               <p rend="small">11. As a Mans Spirit is conſcious of its own ſecret Actings and Thoughts, which no Man elſe can know; ſo the Spirit of God knoweth the Secret things of God, and maketh us know them in our meaſures, which they that have not the Spirit cannot by all their Learning know.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Now we have received, not the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the world: but the ſpirit which is of God, that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God.</p>
               <p rend="small">12. And this Spirit God hath given to us; not the Spirit of the World, to make us carnally and worldly wiſe; but the Spirit of God, to make us ſavour and know God's great myſterious Gifts of Grace.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Which things alſo we ſpeak, not in the words which mans wiſdom teacheth, but which the holy Ghoſt teacheth, comparing ſpiritual things with ſpiritual.</p>
               <p rend="small">13. And theſe are the things which we preach to you, not in the Words and Manner now counted by the Heathens to be Learned and Wiſe, nor after their vain Arts; but in the very Words and Manner which God's Spirit teacheth us, who teacheth us the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, fitting Spiritual Words to Spiritual Things, that all may be of God.</p>
               <p n="14">14. But the natural man receiveth not the things of the ſpirit of God, for they are fooliſhneſs unto him; neither can he know them, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned.</p>
               <p rend="small">14. But they that have not the Spirit themſelves, but meer Nature, cannot with all their Learning re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive theſe ſpiritual Myſteries revealed to us by God; for they will ſeem but Fanatick Dreams and Fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to them, not to be believed. Nor can they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand them; for only a Mind illuminated by God's Spirit doth diſcern them.</p>
               <p n="15">15. But he that is ſpiritual judgeth all things, yet he himſelf is judged of no man.</p>
               <p rend="small">15. But he that is Spiritual diſcerneth theſe revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led things of the Spirit in his Meaſure; when yet he himſelf, and his own Spiritual Apprehenſions and Affections, are unknown to Carnal Men that hear him.</p>
               <p n="16">16. For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may inſtruct him? But we have the mind of Chriſt.</p>
               <p rend="small">16. For who hath pried into God's ſecret Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, or known his Mind, further than he hath opened it to him? But Chriſt our Teacher hath told us his own and his Fathers Mind, which we are to preach to the World for Mens Salvation.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. IT is none of <hi>Paul</hi>'s meaning here, to vilifie true Philoſophy, Logick, or Oratory, or any uſeful Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge or Art: And all Knowledge is uſeful to one that referreth it to right Ends, which is Knowledge indeed: For God hath made nothing knowable in vain. True Phyſicks is the Knowledge of the knowable Works of God, and God in them, that we may admire, love, ſerve, and truſt him. True Logick is but the Skill of uſing our Reaſon truly and orderly. True Grammar and Oratory are but fitting <hi>Words</hi> to <hi>Things,</hi> and to the Hearers Minds, as moſt tendeth to their Edification. God is againſt none of theſe, which are his precious Gifts. But carnal Men have carnal Ends, and fit all theſe abuſively to their Ends, to wrangle againſt Truth, and divert their Minds from Things to Words, and from great and everlaſting Things to Trifles, and to feed their Pride, and Ambition, and Covetouſneſs, and to make their Malignity more keen and hurtful. And ſuch was the Learning of theſe Heathens, which then paſt for Wiſdom in the World.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Nor doth <hi>Paul</hi> here favour falſe Pretenſes of the Spirit, or true Fanaticiſm; when Men take the Delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Satan, or every ſtrong Imagination, or the boiling of their Pride and erroneous Paſſions, fed by Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, for the Work of God's Spirit. Theſe ſin more dangerouſly than many others, by charging their Sin and Errour upon God, and tempting Men to deride the Spirit. Even as falſe Prophets are ſharplieſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, and the counterfeit uſe of Chriſt's Name by the Sons of <hi>Sceva</hi> did but ſtrengthen the Devil againſt them. Therefore we are bid to try the Spirits.</p>

               <p rend="small">1. But this Spiritual Wiſdom, of which I have ſaid ſuch great things, is not in all Chriſtians alike.

               <p n="3">3. But with me it is a very ſmall-thing that I ſhould be judged of you, or of mans judgment: Yea, I judge not mine own ſelf.</p>
               <p rend="small">3. And if any among you cenſure me, I account it a very ſmall matter; tho I deſpiſe no mans juſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition, Man's Judgment ſignifieth little as to my ſelf, further than it may be hurtful to others: For my caſe will not be finally determined by any Mans Judgment, nor by my own.</p>
               <p n="4">4. For I know nothing by my ſelf, yet am I not hereby juſtified: but he that judgeth me is the Lord.</p>

For my Conſcience is witneſs of my ſincerity, and I know no unfaithfulneſs in my Stewardſhip, though I am yet imperfect; but this is not my deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Juſtification, nor is my Conſcience any publick or final Judge, but only the diſcerner of my Caſe. It is Chriſt only whoſe Judgment muſt publickly and finally paſs my doom.</p>

Purge out of your Aſſemblies the old Leaven of ſcandalous Sins, that you may approve your ſelves a Society acceptable to God through Chriſt.</p>
               <p rend="small">
                  <hi>Note,</hi> 1. That, as Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> obſerves out of <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> and <hi>Theodoret,</hi> there was a Tradition, that this Offender was a Biſhop. 2. And the Aſſembly was to purge the Church of ſuch a one, whoever he was, by forſaking him.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Therefore let us keep the feaſt, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedneſs, but with the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leavened bread of ſincerity and truth.</p>

               <p n="9">9. I wrote to you in an epiſtle, not to company with fornicators. 10. Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or with Idolaters; for then muſt ye needs go out of the world.</p>
               <p rend="small">9, 10. I did indeed write to you before (in this or ſome other Epiſtle) to avoid Familiarity with Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cators, Covetous, Extortioners, Idolaters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I meant, that you ſhew your abhorrence of this Sin, and ſhame the Sinner, by ſhunning his Company, when it is unneceſſary, and it is in your power ſo to do: But I meant not that you ſhould have no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany or Converſe at all with any that are ſuch; for you live among Unbelievers, and cannot go out of the World.</p>
               <p n="11">11. But now I have written unto you, not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother, be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner, with ſuch an one, no not to eat.</p>
               <p rend="small">11. But my Meaning and your Duty is, That you ſhun all Company which may ſignifie owning or Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly Familiarity with any called Chriſtians, who are ſuch ſcandalous Sinners, that the Church and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion may not be thought to favour them, and that Shame may humble them. And though it belong not to every Chriſtian, but to the Church, to caſt ſuch out of Publick Societies, nor to ſeparate from the Church becauſe ſuch are there; yet as the Church ought to purge out ſuch, ſo every private Man ſhould avoid that Familiarity which is in their power, even that which lieth in Friendly Eating, or the like.</p>

               <p n="3">3. Let the husband render unto the wife due benevolence: and likewiſe alſo the wife unto the husband.</p>
               <p rend="small">3. And let Husband and Wife perform to each other all the Duties of Marriage which they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The wife hath not power of her own body, but the husband: and likewiſe alſo the husband hath not power of his own body, but the wife.</p>

               <p rend="small">5. To deny this to each other, is Injury and Fraud: except when you are called to Humbling, Faſting, and Prayer; and then you ſhould conſent to that ſort of Abſtinence: but after uſe due Matrimonial Converſation, leſt your forbearance give Satan advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to tempt you.</p>

               <p rend="small">7.

But as to the Caſe of Separation from an Infidel (which ſome may think neceſſary by the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> Caſe in <hi>Ezra, &amp;c.</hi>) I bring you not this as a flat Command of Chriſt, but as my beſt Advice: Though you may let an Infidel go, and may live without, him that will not ſtay with you, but is the Deſerter, in enmity to your Religion; yet I think it beſt for you to do your beſt firſt to make ſuch wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to continue, and, though it be to your great trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to live with ſuch: yet if they be willing to ſtay, be not you the Deſerters, no not for a time, nor omit due means to make them willing; though ſome ſuch will be tyrannical and malicious Adverſaries.</p>
               <p n="14">14. For the unbelieving husband is ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is ſanctified by the husband: elſe were your children unclean, but now are they holy.</p>
               <p rend="small">14. For though the Caſe in <hi>Ezra</hi> may make you doubt how it was with the <hi>Iſraelites</hi>; yet to Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, under the Law of Grace, your abode with an Infidel doth not make your Conjugal Stare, or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, or Family to be unholy. The State and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of a Believer maketh your Relation and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitation holy, as ſeparated to God for holy uſe, which the Believer can improve, as all things elſe are ſanctified to him, for the Service of God Elſe your Children would be like thoſe of the Infidels, unclean, as not in the Covenant and Church of God: but now they are holy, and numbred with his Peculiar People. For the Chriſtian devoteth to God himſelf, and all that is in his power and diſpoſe, which is accepted according to the Capacity and Uſe of that which is devoted; and this he doth by Gods Command, and therefore with his Acceptance; as the Seed of the Faithful always were.</p>
               <p n="15">15. But if the unbelieving depart, let him depart. A brother or a ſiſter is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der bondage in ſuch caſes: but God hath called us to peace.</p>

But yet omit no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that tendeth to a peaceable Cohabitation: for God hath called us all to Peace.</p>

               <p n="18">18. Is any man called being circumciſed? let him not become uncircumciſed: is any called in uncircumciſion? let him not become circumciſed.</p>
               <p rend="small">18. Think not that Chriſtianity requireth any needleſs Changes, to Circumciſion or Uncircumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as to the external Ceremony: It is a Change from Sin to God which it requireth.</p>
               <p n="19">19. Circumciſion is nothing, and uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God.</p>
               <p rend="small">19. To be one that was or that was not circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, is no part of the Chriſtian Religion; but to keep thoſe Commandments which God hath given us, either in the Law of Nature, or by Jeſus Chriſt. Do Gods Work, and make it not more than it is.</p>
               <p n="20">20. Let every man abide in the ſame cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling wherein he was called.</p>
               <p rend="small">20. Pretend not Religion for breaking away from the State of Relation that the Goſpel found you in, without a juſt Diſcharge, or cauſe of Change.</p>
               <p n="21">21. Art thou called being a ſervant? care not for it; but if thou mayeſt be made free, uſe it rather.</p>
               <p rend="small">21. If thou waſt a Servant when thou waſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, be contented with thy Condition; for it's not contrary to thy Deliverance by Chriſt. But if thou maiſt be ſet free from a Servile Life, on lawful Terms, it's rather to be choſen: (For it is not all change of Relation, or outward State, that I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid.)</p>
               <p n="22">22. For he that is called in the Lord, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſervant, is the Lords free-man: like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe alſo he that is called being free, is Chriſts ſervant.</p>
               <p rend="small">22. A Chriſtian Servant hath that ſort of Freedom which Chriſt hath purchaſed: He is freed from Guilt, and the Curſe, and the Slavery of Sin and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan: And the Freeſt and Greateſt that is a Chriſtian, is devoted abſolutely to the Service of Chriſt.</p>

               <p rend="small">23. And if you are free, make not your ſelves needleſly the Servants of Men, eſpecially or Infidels; nor ſerve any Man before Chriſt, or againſt him: For he hath bought you to be his Servants.</p>

               <p n="25">25. Now concerning virgins, I have no commandment of the Lord: yet I give my judgment as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful.</p>
               <p rend="small">25. As to your Queſtion about Virginity, God hath made no Univerſal Law for it, or againſt it; and I pretend not to give you any ſuch. But it being a Caſe to be variouſly reſolved, according to Perſons various Conditions, I ſhall give you faithfully my Judgment how to decide it ſeverally for your ſelves.</p>
               <p n="26">26. I ſuppoſe therefore, that this is good for the preſent diſtreſs, <hi>I ſay,</hi> that it is good for a man ſo to be.</p>
               <p rend="small">26. Chriſtians being now under Perſecution and Diſtreſs, no doubt but it is much more for their eaſe and quiet to be ſingle, than to have a Wife or Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and Children to care for, in Poverty or in Flight.</p>
               <p n="27">27. Art thou bound unto a wife? ſeek not to be looſed. Art thou looſed from a wife? ſeek not a wife.</p>
               <p rend="small">27. If thou be bound, to ſeek to be looſed is a Sin: But if thou art looſed, that thou ſeek not to be bound without neceſſity, is my Advice.</p>
               <p n="28">28. But and if thou marry, thou haſt not ſinned; and if a virgin marry, ſhe hath not ſinned: nevertheleſs, ſuch ſhall have trouble in the fleſh; but I ſpare you.</p>
               <p rend="small">28. But to marry, as ſuch, is no Sin: (Though it be a Sin to do it when there is clear Reaſon againſt it.) But ſuch muſt reckon upon Trouble in the Fleſh. But though I ſorewarn you to prevent your Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, I would not by urgency be your Snare.</p>
               <p n="29">29. But this I ſay, brethren, the time is ſhort. It remaineth, that both they that have wives, be as though they had none; 30. And they that weep, as though they wept not; and they that rejoyce, as though they rejoyced not; and they that buy, as though they poſſeſſed not; 31. And they that uſe this world, as not abuſing it: for the faſhion of this world paſſeth away.</p>
               <p rend="small">29, 30, 31. But this none ſhould forget, that this Life is ſo ſhort, and the End of all ſo near and ſure, that there is little difference between having a Wife or no Wife, weeping or not weeping, rejoicing or not rejoicing, poſſeſſing and not poſſeſſing: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you ſhould have Wives, and weep, and rejoice, and poſſeſs, and uſe this World as if you did it not, with ſuch an Indifferency through the ſenſe of greater things, as that you may not be overmuch affected with the getting, or enjoying, or loſs of any tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitory thing: For all theſe things are in continual

change, and the Faſhion of them paſſeth away.</p>
               <p n="32">32. But I would have you without care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs. He that is unmarried, careth for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may pleaſe the Lord:</p>
               <p rend="small">32. Carefulneſs about the World is ſo bad a thing, that I would have you eſcape it if you can. The unmarried hath leſs Worldly Care to divert him from caring how to pleaſe God, and to do good to others, and ſecure his Soul.</p>
               <p n="33">33. But he that is married, careth for the things that are of the world, how he may pleaſe his wife.</p>
               <p rend="small">33. But he that is married hath made himſelf ſo much more Duty, Temptation, and Trouble, as muſt needs increaſe thoſe Cares which will much divert his Thoughts and Cares from the pleaſing of God: Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, the Care of pleaſing his Wife will take him up; becauſe there is in all Perſons much unſuitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and difference of Judgment, Temper, and Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations; and in the weaker Sex uſually much Paſſion and Impatience, and difficulty in bearing that which croſſeth their Wills; ſo that the wiſeſt Man can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pleaſe ſome, with all his Skill, and Kindneſs, and Diligence, without violating his Duty to God</p>
               <p n="34">34. There is difference alſo between a wife and a virgin: The unmarried woman careth for the things of the Lord, that ſhe may be holy, both in body and ſpirit: but ſhe that is married, careth for the things of the world, how ſhe may pleaſe her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.</p>
               <p rend="small">34. And the difference is great alſo on the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens part, (whoſe Weakneſs uſually can leſs bear Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties, Troubles, and Temptations.) The unmar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried is free from abundance of Troubles and Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which would turn away her Care from the things of God, and ſo ſhe is more free to keep cloſe to God, and to keep both ſpiritual and corporal San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity: But ſhe that is married muſt needs care for wordly things, for Children, and Family, and ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to pleaſe her Huſband, (who poſſibly may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuitable, and tyrannical, and hardly pleaſed without diſpleaſing God.) And to live in mutual diſpleaſure, how ſad and tempting a Condition will that be? (Chriſt told <hi>Martha</hi> how had a choice it was to be cumbred about many things, though lawful, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of chuſing a free Attendance on the Better part.)</p>
               <p n="35">35. And this I ſpeak for your own profit, not that I may caſt a ſnare upon you, but for that which is comely, and that you may attend upon the Lord without diſtraction.</p>
               <p rend="small">35. If any of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ou think that I wrong you, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barring you from the Comforts of Marriage, let ſuch know, that I ſpeak but comparatively, and for your profit tell you, that many ignorantly ruſh upon it, without conſideration, and ſo miſcarry by unexpected Troubles. I forbid not Marriage, nor make a Law for you, to enſnare you; but I would have you pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently to prefer the Condition which is beſt for your ſelves, in which you may ſerve God without diſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Cares.</p>
               <p n="36">36. But if any man think that he beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth himſelf uncomely toward his virgin, if ſhe paſs the flower of her age, and need ſo require, let him do what he will, he ſinneth not: let them marry.</p>
               <p rend="small">36. But in theſe things, about which there is no Common Law, Men ſhould themſelves beſt judge what is ſuitable, convenient, and beſt for themſelves. If therefore you find that your Daughters have need, and that it will be inconvenient to them to paſs the Flower of their Age, let them marry; it is no ſin in it ſelf, nor to ſuch as ſo need it.</p>
               <p n="37">37. Nevertheleſs, he that ſtandeth ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt in his heart, having no neceſſity, but hath power over his own will, and hath ſo decreed in his heart, that he will keep his vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, doth well. 38. So then, he that giveth her in marriage, doth well: but he that giveth her not in marriage, doth better.</p>
               <p rend="small">37, 38. But yet he that being urged by no neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his own or of his Daughter, hath fixed his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution to preſerve the Freedom of a Single Life, (not by Vows, which bind thoſe whoſe Condition God may alter, and ſo make Laws and Snares to themſelves, but) by well-grounded Reaſon ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to God, that can change their State; this Man taketh the way to his Daughters greateſt Peace and Advantage. So then, he that giveth her in Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, doth that which is in it ſelf good, and no ſin: But he that giveth her not in Marriage, doth that which is better for her, if ſhe have no neceſſity.</p>
               <p n="39">39. The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth: but if her Husband be dead, ſhe is at liberty to be married to whom ſhe will; onely in the Lord.</p>
               <p rend="small">39. God's Law and Mans bind the Wife to her Husband during his Life: But if her Husband be dead, ſhe may marry another, if nothing in her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition forbid it; but it muſt be to a Believer, that is fit for her.</p>
               <p n="40">40. But ſhe is happier if ſhe ſo abide, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter my judgment: and I think alſo that I have the ſpirit of God.</p>
               <p rend="small">40. But as I am giving you no Common Law againſt Marriage, or for it, but directing you how every one may diſcern what is beſt for themſelves, my Judgment is, That ordinarily, where there is no neceſſity, a Single Life is more for the Perſons peace and quietneſs, and freedom from Hindrances in ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God, and therefore better for them.</p>

                  <p>DIvers Errours have riſen from the miſunderſtanding of ſome Paſſages in this Chapter. 1. Of them that make <hi>Paul</hi> to ſpeak at uncertainty, without the Spirit of God, when they read, [<hi>by permiſſion, and not by commandment,</hi>] and [<hi>I, and not the Lord</hi>]: When as he only diſclaimeth the giving them a Law in ſtead of particular Direction.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. The Errour of them that hence gather, That God hath given us in Scripture his Counſels, which are no Commands, and make not Duty, nor is it Sin to violate them, but a Work of Supererrogation to do them. Whereas the Apoſtle only diſtinguiſheth of a proper Univerſal Law, and a conſequential Obligation from other General Laws. A Common Law is the Rule of Societies: If ſuch a Law had commanded or Forbidden Marriage, it would be a Duty or a Sin to all: But yet God's Law bindeth all to chuſe that which moſt tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to their own Good, and the eſcape of Evil; and to break this Law is Sin to him that doth it, though the ſame thing he lawful to another, <hi>e. g.</hi> To marry againſt Parents Conſent, to an unmeet Perſon, without Neceſſity, and oblige ones ſelf to inſtruct and maintain a Family, when one is unable for it, and many ſuch Caſes, may make it a great Sin to marry. A Common Law, and a Perſonal Obligation reſulting from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther General Law, much differ.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. The Errour of them that ſay, By Holineſs of Children, <hi>ver.</hi> 14. is meant either Legitimation only, or meer Baptiſm, and not an Intereſt according to their Capacity in the Covenant of Peculiarity, I have ſo far confuted in my <hi>Treatiſe of Infant Baptiſm,</hi> that here I paſs it by.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. One excellent Divine hath hence taken occaſion to ſpeak ſo much againſt changing any Trade or Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, as affrighteth ſome from Lawful Changes, which do more good than hurt.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. From <hi>ver.</hi> 37. many unjuſtly commend abſolute Vows of Celibate; which is to make a Law to God, that he ſhall not bring them into Neceſſity by any Change, and to make Snares and ſelf-binding Laws for themſelves, as if they were their own Rulers, when God hath made them Work enough, and, for ought they know, may bring them under a neceſſity to marry.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. On the other ſide, by a blind oppoſition to this Extreme, thouſands raſhly run into Marriage, without conſidering the Difficulties, Cares, Sufferings, Troubles, and Temptations that attend it: And being ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed unprepared, live accordingly in worldly Cares, Impatience, and Diſcontent.</p>

               <p n="1">1. NOw as touching things offered unto idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puſſeth up, but cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity edifieth.</p>
               <p rend="small">1. As to your Caſe about things offered to Idols, they that, to defend their licentious Practice herein, pretend to know more of their Liberty than we do, muſt underſtand, that we have Knowledge as well as they; and Knowledge without Charity is not an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency to be boaſted of; it doth but puff Men up with Pride and Self-conceitedneſs: but Charity is neceſſary to true Edification.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And if any man think that he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth any thing, he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know.</p>
               <p rend="small">2. And this Conceitedneſs of their great Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Wiſdom, proveth that they know nothing at all as they ought. If they knew themſelves, or Man, they would know the weakneſs of Mans Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and how little they know. If they knew God, or any of his Works, they would know their Incomprehenſibleneſs. Indeed though we know <hi>ſomewhat of God,</hi> and his Works, and Word, we have no adequate knowledge of any thing in the World; we know not the whole of any thing, but ſome part of it. And to be ignorant of our Ignorance, is a double Ignorance. It is this falſe Conceit, That Men know more than indeed they know, which is the grand Cauſe of all the pernicious Errours of the World; And confident Errour is far more dangerous and hurtful than meer Neſcience.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But if any man love God, the ſame is known of him.</p>
               <p rend="small">3. But he that hath ſuch Knowledge as habitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth his Soul to the true Love of God and Holineſs, is one that God owneth and knoweth as his own, and attaineth the true End of Knowledge: For our Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is better ſecured by Gods loving beneficent Knowledge of us, and all our Concerns, than by our own Wiſdom.</p>
               <p n="4">4. As concerning therfore the eating of thoſe things that are offered in ſacrifice unto idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is none other God but one.</p>
               <p rend="small">4. And as to the Caſe of eating things offered to Idols, we know, as well as theſe Pretenders to great Wiſdom, that Idols are nothing but Fictions of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Men, and that there is no God but one.</p>
               <p n="5">5. For though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or in earth (as
<pb facs="tcp:66325:178"/>
there be gods many, and lords many) 6. But to us there is but one God, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, of whom are all things, and we in him; and one Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by whom are all things, and we by him.</p>
               <p rend="small">5, 6. For though the World hath feigned many Deities, Supreme and Subordinate ones, as Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; yet we know that there is but One God the Father, of whom all Creatures have all their Beings, and for and to whom we and all things are; and One Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by whom all things were at firſt created, and are ordered, and by whom we are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed, and who only is our Mediator with this One God.</p>
               <p rend="small">(<hi>Note,</hi> That this Text, which the <hi>Arians</hi> greatly boaſt of, and miſtake, as if it expreſly confined the Deity to the Father, as diſtinct from Chriſt, is vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly expounded againſt them by two ſorts of Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitors. I. The ordinary Expoſition is, 1. That though there be but One God the Father, the ſame God is alſo the Son. 2. But (more probably) that in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <hi>God the Father</hi> (as <hi>Fundamentum Trinitatis,</hi> as the Schoolmen ſpeak) is oft put for the Deity, as ſuch, comprehending the Three Perſons. II. Theirs that hold three Natures in Chriſt, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. The Second Perſon in the Divine Nature<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2. Unitively produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the firſt of Creatures, a Superangelical Being, by whom he made all other Creatures, and who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to the Fathers of old. And, 3. The Humane Nature aſſumed into Perſonal Union by the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angelical and Divine. Theſe ſay, that Chriſt is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led [<hi>One Lord, by whom are all things</hi>] as in this firſt created Superangelical Nature, diſtinct from One God the Father, but not divided from him. But beſides <hi>Peter Sterry,</hi> and ſome ſuch of late, few have enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained this)</p>
               <p n="7">7. Howbeit there is not in every man that knowledge: for ſome with conſcience of the idol unto this hour, eat it as a thing of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered unto an idol; and their conſcience be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing weak, is defiled.</p>
               <p rend="small">7. But when every Man knoweth not this, that an Idol is nothing, but Cuſtom hath fixed in Men the conceit of many Subordinate Demi-gods, to whom they think they owe ſome Worſhip, ſome Novices and corrupted Profeſſors of Chriſtianity are not yet cured of theſe dangerous Opinions, and really intend ſome Honour to the Idol; and their Diſeaſed Souls will be more defiled, when they are herein encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by your Example, and ſee you do the ſame out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Act, though you do it not with the ſame Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and Intention.</p>
               <p rend="small">(<hi>Note,</hi> Some Expoſitors rather think that this is the Senſe; [Some know not that an Idol is nothing, but think them real Demons that are worſhipped, and that eating things offered to them is real Worſhip; and are tempted to it by fear to ſave themſelves, and will be hardned and defiled by the encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of your Example.] But this ſeemeth not ſo agreeable to the Phraſe.)</p>
               <p n="8">8. But meat commendeth us not to God: for neither if we eat are we the better, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther if we eat not are we the worſe.</p>
               <p rend="small">8. It is not the meer eating or not eating the Meat, that is any great matter, nor maketh one bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and more acceptable to God, and another worſe.</p>
               <p n="9">9. But take heed leſt by any means-this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of yours become a ſtumbling-block to them that are weak.</p>
               <p rend="small">9. But take heed, though the eating of that Meat as ſuch be lawful, leſt by outward Symbolizing with Idolaters you ſeem to worſhip the Idol, and ſo tempt others both to the mutual Errour and corporal Sin, (againſt Charity and Piety, <hi>viz.</hi> the Second Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment:) For weak unſetled Perſons are too eaſily ſeduced.</p>
               <p n="10">10. For if any man ſee thee which haſt knowledge, ſit at meat in the idols temple, ſhall not the conſcience of him which is weak be emboldened to eat thoſe things which are offered to idols:</p>
               <p rend="small">10. For though thou ſay, that thou doſt not offer it to an Idol, but eat it in that Temple, to avoid dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, as a common Meal; yet thy Action will perſuade the weak, that it is lawful, which ſo knowing a Man doth ſeem by his own Practice to approve.</p>
               <p n="11">11. And through thy knowledge ſhall the weak brother periſh, for whom Chriſt died?</p>
               <p rend="small">11. And whereas Chriſt died, roſe, and revived, that he might be Lord of the Dead and Living, and hath a Right of Propriety unto all, having purchaſed for them a Conditional Gift of Salvation, thou wilt now rob Chriſt of his Right, and them of their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, by the abuſe of thy pretended Knowledge.</p>
               <p n="12">12. But when ye ſin ſo againſt the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and wound their weak conſcience, ye ſin againſt Chriſt.</p>
               <p rend="small">12. Know therefore, that thus enſnaring the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of the weak by Temptation, is not only un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable wrong to them, but Sin and Injury againſt the very Blood and Right of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Wherefore if meat make my brother to offend, I will eat no fleſh while the world ſtandeth, leſt I make my brother to offend.</p>
               <p rend="small">13. I conclude then, That I do not make ſo light of anothers Sin, nor ſet ſo light by the Soul of a weak Brother, or by the Blood and Right of Chriſt, as for Fleſh, or any unneceſſary thing, to abuſe my Liberty, when it will prove to them a dangerous Temptation to Sin. Though it be their culpable weakneſs that maketh them in ſuch danger, I will forbear Fleſh as long as I live, if that conduce to ſave them from Sin, (unleſs God lay on me a neceſſity to do otherwiſe, and leave it no longer to my liberty as indifferent.)

                  <hi>Note,</hi> O Then what have thoſe Papal Church-Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants to anſwer for, that by their numerous, vain, yea, noxious Canons, to ſhew their uſurped Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on over Souls, will rather tempt Men, and excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate Chriſtians, and burn them, and keep the Chriſtian World in ſcandalous pernicious Strife, than they will give Men leave to deny Obedience to their Uſurpation in ſuch things? And how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like <hi>Paul</hi> are they that ſay, They will not deny their own Liberty or Convenience in an unneceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Humour or Pleaſure, for any Man, whoſe Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour or Weakneſs is the cauſe of his Offence or Stumbling?</p>
               <p rend="small">And many good Chriſtians miſtake this and ſuch Texts, thinking that by <hi>offending the weak</hi> is meant <hi>diſpleaſing</hi> them, and doing that which others take for Sin: When as by <hi>offending,</hi> is meant lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Stumbling-block, or cauſeleſs occaſioning or tempting Men to Sin and Ruine.</p>

               <p n="1">1. AM I not an apoſtle? am I not free? have I not ſeen Jeſus Chriſt our Lord? are not you my work in the Lord?</p>
               <p rend="small">1. It ſeems ſome among you object againſt me, 1. That I am no Apoſtle. 2. That I get my Living by Tent-making. 3. That I am none of thoſe that knew Chriſt. 4. That my Knowledge is lower than theirs. To all which I ſay, 1. That Chriſt made me an Apoſtle by his Miſſion. 2. That I may uſe my own Liberty, either to live on the Church, or on my Labour, as is moſt for the furtherance of the Goſpel. 3. That I have ſeen Chriſt from Heaven, though not on Earth. 4. That you are the Fruit and Seal of my Miniſtry, which therefore is not to be queſtioned by you.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If I be not an apoſtle unto others, yet doubtleſs I am to you: for the ſeal of mine apoſtleſhip are ye in the Lord.</p>
               <p rend="small">2. You of all Men ſhould not queſtion my Apoſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, who were converted by it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Mine anſwer to them that do examine me, is this, 4. Have we not power to eat and to drink? 5. Have we not power to lead about a ſiſter, a wife as well as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther apoſtles, and as the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas? 6. Or I onely and Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas, have not we power to forbear work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?</p>
               <p rend="small">3, 4, 5, 6. And as to my Labour, I anſwer, That I own my Power to live on the Church: And I that perſuade you to forbear the uſe of your Liberty when it would do hurt, do go before you by my own Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample. I have right to be maintained by my Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and to put the Church to the charge of a Wife and Family with me, as other Apoſtles do. I and <hi>Barnabas</hi> have power to forbear working for our Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Who goeth a warfare at any time at his own charges? who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not of the fruit therereof? or who feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock?</p>
               <p rend="small">7. Soldiers are paid by thoſe that uſe them; and the Husbandman and Shepherd live on the Fruit of their Labour: and ſo may I.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Say I theſe things as a man? or ſaith not the law the ſame alſo? 9. For it is written in the law of Moſes, Thou ſhalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn. Doth God take care for oxen? 10. Or ſaith he it altogether for our ſakes? for our ſakes, no doubt, this is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten: that he that ploweth ſhould plow in hope; and that he that threſheth in hope, ſhould be partaker of his hope.</p>
               <p rend="small">8, 9, 10. Do I ſpeak this as a Man pleading his own Intereſt? Doth not God ſay it in his Law? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And doth God make Laws chiefly for the good of Oxen, or for Men? For Men, no doubt, to encourage them by juſt Expectations of the Fruit of their own juſt Labours.</p>
               <p n="11">11. If we have ſown unto you ſpiritual things, is it a great thing if we ſhall reap your carnal things?</p>
               <p rend="small">11. The Spiritual things which we ſowed with you, are far greater than the Carnal things which we may reap: And if you maintain others, you owe more to us.</p>
               <p n="12">12. If others be partakers of this power over you, are not we rather? Nevertheleſs, we have not uſed this power; but ſuffer all things, leſt we ſhould hinder the goſpel of Chriſt.</p>
               <p rend="small">12. Yet have I not claimed or taken that which is my due, leſt it ſhould hinder the Succeſs of my Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Do ye not know that they which mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter about holy things, live of the things of the temple? and they which wait at the altar, are partakers with the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar?</p>
               <p rend="small">13. You know that the Levites and Prieſts live on the Things that are offered in the Temple and at the Altar.</p>
               <p n="14">
                  <pb facs="tcp:66325:179"/>14. Even ſo hath the Lord ordained, that they which preach the goſpel, ſhould live of the goſpel.</p>
               <p rend="small">14. So is it the Lords own Appointment, (who ſaid, <hi>The labourer is worthy of his hire</hi>) that they who are called to preach the Goſpel as a ſtated Office, (and not only occaſionally) ſhould be maintained in and for that Labour, and not be taken off by Cares and Worldly Labour.</p>
               <p n="15">15. But I have uſed none of theſe things. Neither have I written theſe things, that it ſhould be ſo done unto me: for it were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for me to die, then that any man ſhould make my glorying void.</p>
               <p rend="small">15. But as I have not made uſe of this my Due, ſo I write not as expecting it: For I value my Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges for the Goſpel as my Glory, above my Right, and above my Life.</p>
               <p n="16">16. For though I preach the goſpel, I have nothing to glory of: for neceſſity is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I preach not the goſpel.</p>
               <p rend="small">16. For my bare Preaching would have nothing ſingular, to vindicate me from Calumny, or extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily further the Succeſs of my Labours: Even bad Men preach, and I am under a Command or Law of Chriſt, which will puniſh me if I do not.</p>
               <p n="17">17. For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward: but if againſt my will, a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of the goſpel is committed unto me.</p>
               <p rend="small">17. For if my Preaching, and that without Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance from you, be done willingly, God will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward me (who accepteth no unwilling Service): But if I preach but for fear of Puniſhment, and take not Maintenance becauſe Men will not give it, I do but a Task impoſed on me, and forfeit my Reward ſo far as I am unwilling.</p>
               <p n="18">18. What is my reward then? verily that when I preach the goſpel, I may make the goſpel of Chriſt without charge, that I abuſe not my power in the goſpel.</p>
               <p rend="small">18. What then is that Qualification of my Service which God will ſpecially reward? Not the meer Task of Preaching; but that I ſo do it, as to devote all my own Rights and Intereſt to the Great Ends of the Goſpel; and whatever I loſe or ſuffer by it, take that courſe which tendeth moſt to promote the deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Succeſs.</p>
               <p n="19">19. For though I be free from all men, yet have I made my ſelf ſervant unto all, that I might gain the more.</p>
               <p rend="small">19. I am no Mans Slave or Bond-man, to ſerve him againſt my will: but I am a voluntary Servant to all Men, in charity to ſave them, and in obedience to Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="20">20. And unto the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law; 21. To them that are without law, as without law, (being not without law to God, but under the law to Chriſt) that I might gain them that are without law. 22. To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak: I am made all things to all men, that I might by all means ſave ſome.</p>
               <p rend="small">20, 21, 22. To the <hi>Jews,</hi> and thoſe whoſe Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Conſciences keep them under <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law, I behaved my ſelf by all Lawful Compliance and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to that Law, that I might win them, (preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Truth of the Goſpel, and my own and the <hi>Gentiles</hi> Liberty.) When I converſe with the <hi>Gentiles</hi> that are not under the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and have no written Law of God, as the <hi>Jews</hi> have, but only the Law of Nature, and Mens Laws, I fit my ſelf and Doctrine to their State and Capacity, to win them, not pleading the written Law with them, as I do with the <hi>Jews</hi>: (Though I am far from thinking or living as lawleſs; for I am under Chriſts own Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and Law) To the ſcrupulous ignorant ſort of Chriſtians, and thoſe that are yet unſetled, and liable to temptation, I behaved my ſelf with all winning Compliance and Pleaſingneſs; knowing, that ſtiff Singularity, and affected or unneceſſary Croſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to others, is not the way to gain, but to alienate them. And though I know that all will not be won by ſuch Compliance, yet I am made all things lawful towards all Men, that by this my duty I may ſave ſome.</p>
               <p n="23">23 And this I do for the goſpels ſake, that I might be partaker thereof with you.</p>
               <p rend="small">23. All this I do, not as a man pleaſing Flatterer, for Lucre or Repute; but to promote the Ends of the Goſpel with you, that you and I may rejoice therein together.</p>
               <p n="24">24. Know ye not that they which run in a race, run all, but one receiveth the prize? So run that ye may obtain.</p>
               <p rend="small">24. As it is not every one that runneth that wins the Prize; ſo it is not every one that preacheth, or profeſſeth Chriſtianity, that is accepted to Salvation. Therefore ſo preach, and ſo live, as anſwereth your Covenant and Profeſſion, and as God hath promiſed to accept and reward.</p>
               <p n="25">25. And every man that ſtriveth for the maſtery is temperate in all things: Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown, but we an incorruptible.</p>
               <p rend="small">25. Even in Ludicrous Plays, Races, Combates, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Men prepare their Bodies by Abſtinence and ſtrict Diet, and this but for a withering Garland, Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe, or Prize: And ſhall not we do much more for the Heavenly Glory?</p>
               <p n="26">
                  <pb facs="tcp:66325:179"/>26. I therefore ſo run, not as uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: ſo fight I, not as one that beateth the air:</p>
               <p rend="small">26. I therefore do not run in vain, as not knowing for what, or as by Sloth to loſe the Prize; nor fight I as Fencers, for meer Shew and Oſtentation.</p>
               <p n="27">27. But I keep under my body, and bring it into ſubjection: leſt that by any means when I have preached to others, I my ſelf ſhould be a caſt-away.</p>
               <p rend="small">27. But my firſt work is about my ſelf, to mortifie and ſubdue all my Fleſhly Deſires, which ſtand againſt my Duty, and to keep my Body in conſtant ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, leſt when by Preaching I have won others, I ſhould as a carnal Man be loſt and caſt away my ſelf.</p>
               <p rend="small">(And if you are true to the Goſpel, and to your own Souls, and would not prove ſelf-deceiving Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, take you the ſame courſe, and devote all your Intereſts to the Ends of your Profeſſion, and the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of Souls, in ſtead of pleading for and abuſing your real or pretended Liberties, to the tempting of others, and hindring their Salvation, and boaſting of this pernicious Folly, as the Knowledge wherein you excel others.)</p>

Or, That he was a poor Mechanick Fellow, that at laſt muſt be caſt on their Charge or Charity. 3. Or, That he ſollicited them for Contributions to the Poor at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> or for others; and they ſuggeſted, that he partly meant himſelf.

                  <p n="3">III.

And were all baptized unto Moſes in the cloud, and in the ſea; 3. And did all eat the ſame ſpiritual meat; 4. And did all drink the ſame ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual drink: (For they drank of that ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Chriſt.)</p>
               <p rend="small">1, 2, 3, 4. And becauſe your boaſt of Knowledge, and your ſcandalous uncharitable abuſe of your Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and inſulting therein, give me cauſe to be jealous of many among you, let me further remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber you, That it is not your being Baptized, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Partakers of outward Privileges, and being emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in the Church, that will ſave you, if you live in Sin: For all the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> paſſed through the Sea, and were under the Cloud, and ſo were typically bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed by Covenant to <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law; and they did all eat the Paſſover, which was Sacramentally Spiritual Meat, and typically as our Euchariſt; and they all drank of the miraculous Rock-water oft in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, which Rock and Water were typically or ſpiritually Chriſt and his Sacramental Blood.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But with many of them God was not well pleaſed: for they were overthrown in the wilderneſs.</p>
               <p rend="small">5. And yet with many, yea moſt of them, God was ſo offended by their Sin, that he overthrew them in the Wilderneſs.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Now theſe things were our examples, to the intent we ſhould not luſt after evil things, as they alſo luſted.</p>
               <p rend="small">6. Now theſe were admoniſhing Types to us, and written to warn us, that we luſt not after forbidden gratifying of the Fleſh, as they did: (If they are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed as luſting in the Wilderneſs for Fleſh, when they had onely Manna for forty years, what exceſs of Luſt is it in them that take it for their Liberty and Wiſdom to ſerve their Fleſh and Appetite, to the ſcandal of others by their ill Example?)</p>
               <p n="7">7. Neither be ye idolaters, as were ſome

               <p rend="small">9. And be warned by their Plagues, that you make not your Fleſhly Luſts, and your impatience of Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, to be the Law and Meaſure of your Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations from God, as if he muſt needs do what your Fleſh would have him, and allow you to do what you deſire.</p>

Do we not join in a profeſſed Reception of theſe, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to us by Chriſt?</p>
               <p n="17">17. For we being many are one bread, and one body: for we are all partakers of that one bread.</p>
               <p rend="small">17. For we that are many Perſons, are one Church or Body of Chriſt, by Covenant-union with him the Bread of Life, of whom we all Sacramentally and profeſſed'y partake; as many Grains of Corn make one Loaf and many Members one Body.</p>

And now do not we know as well as others, that an Idol or Image is nothing, (but Wood, Stone, Gold, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) and that the Meat that is offered them is not in it ſelf at all changed from what it was? But I ſay, that it is Devils that ſeduce the Heathens to this Idolatry, and Devils whom they thereby obey, and Devils whom they worſhip, as ſuppoſed Demi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gods, there repreſented; and conſequentially, Devils with whom they have this Federal Communion.

               <p rend="small">22. Shall we provoke God by that which in the Second Commandment, and often, he hath told us, he will be a jealous Avenger of? Are we ſtrong enough to overcome him, or to bear the Wrath of the Almighty?</p>
               <p n="23">23. All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient: all things are law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for me, but all things edifie not.</p>
               <p rend="small">23. As I am from under <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law, and not bound by it, as ſuch; ſo alſo I know that all Meats are in themſelves now clean, and lawful to me: But lawful things may be uſed contrary to the Will of God, the Ends of Chriſtianity, and the Edification of others; and the Law of Chriſt forbiddeth us ſo to uſe them.</p>
               <p n="24">24. Let no man ſeek his own: but every man anothers wealth.</p>
               <p rend="small">24. We are bound by Chriſt to love others as our ſelves, and therefore not to prefer our own ſmall and bodily Intereſt or Safety, before the ſpiritual, great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Good of others; nor to do only what we think beſt for our ſelves, but alſo what is beſt for others, (eſpecially for the Church of Chriſt.)</p>
               <p n="25">25. Whatſoever is ſold in the ſhambles, that eat, asking no queſtion for conſcience ſake. 26. For the earth is the Lords, and the fulneſs thereof.</p>
               <p rend="small">25. If it be ſold in the Shambles, it is common Food to you; your Conſciences need not ask whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be unclean, or whether it was ever offered to any Idol. 26. God, that is the Lord of all the Earth, hath allowed us all that is fit for Food.</p>
               <p n="27">27. If any of them that believe not, bid you to a feaſt, and ye be diſpoſed to go; whatſoever is ſet before you eat, asking no queſtion for conſcience ſake.</p>
               <p rend="small">27. As it is not unlawful when invited to go to a Feaſt to Unbelievers; ſo, when you ſee cauſe to go, eat what is ſet before you, and queſtion not the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of it your ſelves.</p>
               <p n="28">28. But if any man ſay unto you, This is offered in ſacrifice unto idols, eat not, for his ſake that ſhewed it, and for conſcience ſake. The earth is the Lords, and the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs thereof.</p>
               <p rend="small">28. But if any Man ſay, This is part of the Meat that was an Idol Sacrifice, eat not of it, for his ſake that told thee ſo, leſt thou tempt him to venture on Idol-Sacrifices; and for Conſcience ſake, that thou uncharitably ſeduce not his Conſcience. God hath allowed thee lawful Meats enough; thou needeſt not eat to others hurt.</p>
               <p n="29">29. Conſcience I ſay, not thine own, but of the others: for why is my liberty judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of another mans conſcience?</p>
               <p rend="small">29. When I ſay Conſcience, I mean, that you wrong not anothers Conſcience. I mean not that this Meat is unlawful to you, had you not been told it was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to Idols, or had eaten it privately, where no one was hurt by it: For another Mans Conſcience is not my Guide, nor makes Lawful Food Unlawful to me. But Uncharitableneſs, and Hurtfulneſs to others, (as well as Corporal Idolatry) I muſt make Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to avoid my ſelf, as againſt the great Commands of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="30">30. For, if I by grace be a partaker, why am I evil ſpoken of for that for which I give thanks?</p>
               <p rend="small">30. For if I neither ſeem to worſhip the Idol my ſelf, nor hurt another, but with Thankſgiving eat what's ſet before me at a Common Feaſt, though another expect that I ſhould enquire whether it was not an Idols Sacrifice, I ſin not, nor ought he to ſpeak evil of me as a Sinner.</p>
               <p n="31">31. Whether therefore ye eat or drink, or whatſoever ye do, do all to the glory God.</p>
               <p rend="small">31. Therefore, as in all that you do, ſo in theſe things, where God hath made no particular, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, determining Law, the Intereſt of our Great End, the Glory of God, muſt be our common and moſt obliging Law: Neither eat, nor drink, nor do any thing againſt the Glory of God, and your Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and the Good of others, in which God is glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified. Yea, do nothing but what, as ſome Means, hath its tendency to his Glory; nothing that is either hurtful or vain.</p>

               <p n="1">1. BE ye followers of me, even as I alſo am of Chriſt.</p>
               <p rend="small">1. In all this ſelf-denial which I tell you I have uſed, I follow Chriſt, who denied his very Life for us. Therefore follow me, as I follow Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Now I praiſe you brethren, that you remember me in all things, and keep the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances as I delivered them to you.</p>
               <p rend="small">2. It is your Praiſe (as well as your Duty and Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) that you remember what Doctrine and Orders we Apoſtles of Chriſt at firſt delivered to you, and keep that which then we taught you.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Chriſt; and the head of the woman, is the man; and the head of Chriſt, is God.</p>
               <p rend="small">3. And now to your Caſe about Church-Order, I firſt remember you, that the due Subordination of Perſons muſt be kept: Chriſt is the Head of all Men, high and low; and the Man is the Head of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who therefore muſt ſhew Subjection; and God is the Head of Chriſt, as Man and Mediator.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Every man praying, or propheſying, having his head covered, diſhonoureth his head.</p>
               <p rend="small">4. It being the Cuſtom then to cover the Faces of thoſe that were put to any great ſhame, a Man that ſhall vail his Head and Face, doth thereby take Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach unto himſelf.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But every woman that prayeth, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſieth with her head uncovered, diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noureth her head: for that is even all one as if ſhe were ſhaven.</p>
               <p rend="small">5. But for a Woman to be uncovered in the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly at Publick Worſhip, Prayer, or Prophecying, is a diſhonour to her, as contrary to the ſign of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection which is her Duty.</p>
               <p rend="small">(<hi>Note,</hi> That the Woman is ſaid to Pray or Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, that joyneth with the Church therein.)</p>
               <p rend="small">As Cuſtom maketh it a ſhame to her to be ſhaven, ſo alſo to be unvailed.</p>
               <p rend="small">(<hi>Note,</hi> That this was a changeable Cuſtom, and is contrary now with us.)</p>
               <p n="6">6. For if the woman be not covered, let her alſo be ſhorn: but if it be a ſhame for a woman to be ſhorn or ſhaven, let her be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.</p>
               <p rend="small">6. The Cuſtom of long Hair as a kind of Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, pleads alſo for the Cuſtom of Vailing.</p>
               <p n="7">7. For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, for as much as he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man.</p>
               <p rend="small">7. The Mans Face is uſed well to be uncovered, as being firſt made in the Image of God, and ſo a Beam of his Splendour: But the Woman made out of Man, is ſubject to him and his Splendour.</p>
               <p n="8">8. For the man is not of the woman, but the woman of the man.</p>
               <p rend="small">8. For at the Creation the Man was firſt made, and the Woman was made out of the Man.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Neither was the man created for the woman: but the woman for the man.</p>
               <p rend="small">9. And ſo God made the Woman after, to be a meet Help for the Man; and not the Woman firſt, and then the Man, as a Helper to her: (Though they muſt now be mutual Helpers.)</p>
               <p n="10">10. For this cauſe ought the woman to have power on her head, becauſe of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.</p>
               <p rend="small">10. Therefore the Woman ought to be vailed, to ſignifie her ſubjection to the Power of Man, yea, and eſpecially her Reverence to the Miniſters of God, (and perhaps of the Angels that are Spectators of the Church aſſembles: Doctrinally both are true; though which is here meant, cannot be proved.)</p>
               <p n="11">11. Nevertheleſs, neither is the man with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the woman, neither the woman without the man in the Lord.</p>
               <p rend="small">11. Yet Men have no Being but by Women, nor without Men do Women exiſt or propagate; and this is by the Ordination of the Lord.</p>
               <p n="12">12. For as the woman is of the man, even ſo is the man alſo by the woman: but all things of God.</p>
               <p rend="small">12. For as at the firſt Creation the Woman was taken out of the Man, ſo in Generation the Man is of the Woman, and all things are of God.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Judge in your ſelves: is it comely that a woman pray unto God uncovered?</p>
               <p rend="small">13. The ſignification of being uncovered, being by Cuſtom a Note Superiority, judge in your ſelves whether ſuch be decent for a Woman at the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches Prayers.</p>
               <p n="14">14. Doth not even nature it ſelf teach you, that if a man have long hair, it is a ſhame unto him?</p>
               <p rend="small">
                  <pb facs="tcp:66325:181"/>14. And when common Cuſtom hath made the wearing of Hair at length the Note of the Female Sex, doth not Nature it ſelf tell you, that it is a ſhame for a Man to be ſo like a Woman? (when God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeth us ſo much as to be cloathed as Women, to confound the Sexes, which muſt needs be viſibly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed.)</p>
               <p n="15">15. But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for her hair is given her for a covering.</p>

                  </gap>lls us, that for Women to let their Hair grow out at length, is a ſignification of Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, as a kind of Covering, and ſo is decent to them.</p>
               <p n="16">16. But if any man ſeem to be contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, we have no ſuch cuſtom, neither the churches of God.</p>
               <p rend="small">16. But if any will contentiouſly diſpute againſt what I ſay, though I would make no greater a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ſuch things than the nature of them requireth, let this Anſwer ſuffice to reſolve ſober Minds: The Cuſtom of all the Churches is againſt Womens being uncovered, as an unſeemly thing; and you ſhould not eaſily be different from all the Churches, in a Matter which depends on the Signification of an Action, which Uſe and common Opinion muſt interpret. We, that muſt be as concordant as we can, muſt not affect diſſimilitude.</p>
               <p n="17">17. Now in this that I declare unto you, I praiſe you not, that you come together, not for the better, but for the worſe.</p>
               <p rend="small">17. But about your Church-Aſſemblies I have a greater matter, of which I muſt blame you; that you come together for holy Communion, not as you ought, but in ſinful ſort.</p>
               <p n="18">18. For firſt of all, when ye come toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the church, I hear that there be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions among you; and I partly believe it.</p>
               <p rend="small">18. For firſt, when your coming together in one Church, to profeſs Union and Communion, as Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of one Body in holy Love, yet I hear credibly, that you even there ſhew your Diviſions, and are of diſſenting Minds, and Parties, and Practices.</p>
               <p n="19">19. For there muſt be alſo hereſies among you, that they which are approved, may be made manifeſt among you.</p>
               <p rend="small">19. For God will permit Hereſies, or Sects and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, to ariſe among you, to try you, that it may be ſeen who are ſound, well ſetled, approved Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, (when the Chaff flieth away.)</p>
               <p n="20">20. When ye come together therefore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one place, this is not to eat the Lords ſupper. 21. For in eating every one taketh before other his own ſupper: and one is hungry, and another is drunken.</p>
               <p rend="small">20, 21. When you meet in one place, as a Church, to profeſs Unity in Chriſt, it is not like the Supper of the Lord, which<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is a holy Feaſt of Sacramental Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, where all had the ſame Food, and the ſame Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Body and Blood of Chriſt: For you firſt bring to the Church every one his own Supper for himſelf, inſtead of a Common Feaſt of Love, and the Rich eat and drink to the full, and the Poor are hungry.</p>
               <p n="22">22. What, have ye not houſes to eat and to drink in? or deſpiſe ye the church of God, and ſhame them that have not? What ſhall I ſay to you? ſhall I praiſe you in this? I praiſe you not.</p>
               <p rend="small">22. If you muſt d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This is a Practice worthy to be blamed in you.</p>
               <p n="23">23. For I have received of the Lord that which I alſo delivered unto you, that the Lord Jeſus, the ſame night in which he was betrayed, took bread: 24.

               <p n="26">

               <p rend="small">26. For by the frequent uſe of this Bread and Cup, ye are to repreſent and declare the Sacrificing of Chriſt for our Sins, till he come in Glory.</p>

               <p rend="small">27. And it being ſo ſacred an Inſtitution, for ſo high a Uſe, whoever ſhall profane it, and uſe it but as common Food, or contrary to the holy Ends of it, which is the ſignification of Gods Love to us by the Sacrifice of Chriſt for our Sins, and our Signification and Covenant of Love and Union with him and one another, he partaketh in Guilt with them that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe and crucifie him.</p>

And yet the Cuſtom is ſo common in moſt Nations for Women to wear their Hair at full length, and Men to cut it, that it ſeems there is ſomewhat in Nature that tendeth to this difference, (as there is in Kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Proſtration, to ſhew Humiliation and Submiſſion:) And to conſound the Difference of Sexes in Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits, is a great Sin, tending to Debauchery, and to hide unclean and Beaſtly Converſation.

                  <p n="1">1. On one ſide, by over-doing in the Dogmatical and Ceremonious part, it is turned into the Monſters of Tranſubſtantiation, the Prieſts Communion alone while the People look on, a half Sacrament without the Cup, a <hi>Latin</hi> Maſs not underſtood, a Real Sacrifice offered for the Dead, in ſtead of a Repreſentative Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorative Sacrifice; the Adoration of Bread as God, ſuppoſed to be no Bread, but the Body of God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And it's made an Engine to wrack Mens Conſciences, and tear the Church, by excommunicating all that dare not Conform to all the Dreſſes which uſurping Domination hath painted this Sacrament withal: And the Blood of Chriſts faithful Servants is ſhed, for not following all theſe Opinions and antick Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies that the Sacrifice of Chriſts Body and Blood is abuſed by: So that, alas! how many Churches are torn, and perſecute one another, for not uſing this Sacrament of Love and Communion according to thoſe Devices of Men, which <hi>Peter</hi> or <hi>Paul</hi> never uſed or approved?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. On the other ſide, many godly Perſons, quite miſunderſtanding the Words of <hi>Paul,</hi> about [<hi>unworthy receiving],</hi> come with ſuch an exceſs of Reverence and Fear, leſt they eat and drink their own Damnation, that either they ſeldom venture to Communicate, (which the old Chriſtians did oftner than every Lords Day) or elſe they are more terrified far, than comforted: And looking that God ſhould ſuddenly comfort them in the very Act of Receiving, while they fight againſt their own Comforts by Miſtakes and unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Fears, when they feel not their Expectation anſwered, they are ready to deſpair, as having received unworthily. And ſhould they do ſo by Prayer and Hearing, what a Torment and Slavery would they make of Religion, by their Errour?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And yet the Ignorant and Ungodly, who truly receive unworthily, can from the bare doing of the outward Act, ſteal to themſelves that deceitful Comfort by which they are emboldned to go on in Sin, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing that now God pardoneth all. Thus Satan hath turned Chriſts Sacred Ordinance againſt himſelf, and the Peace of the Church, and the Comfort of ſome, and the Reformation of others; and carrieth on theſe moſt horrid Depravations with ſuch odious Succeſs, that without Wonders of gracious Providence, there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth no probability of Deliverance from theſe heavy Effects of Sacrament-diſtraction.</p>

               <p n="1">1. NOw concerning ſpiritual gifts, bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, I would not have you igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant. 2. Ye know that ye were Gentiles carried away unto theſe dumb idols, even as ye were led.</p>
               <p rend="small">1, 2. As to your caſe of diſcerning Spirits and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Gifts, it is of great importance that you ſhould not be ignorant, leſt you ſhould take evil Spirits for the Spirit of God, or not diſtinguiſh the various Gifts of Gods own Spirit in Believers: In your Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then ſtate you were carried away with Idol Oracles and Worſhip.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Wherefore I give you to underſtand, that no man ſpeaking by the Spirit of God, calleth Jeſus accurſed: and that no man can ſay that Jeſus is the Lord, but by the holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p rend="small">3. Firſt, in general you may be ſure, that none of thoſe Idol Oracles or Blaſphemers that ſpeak againſt Chriſt, and Anathematize him, as Infidels do, do ſpeak by the Spirit of God. (For God's Spirit bore uncontrolable witneſs to Chriſt, by Propheſie, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, Miracles, and Holineſs.) And on the contrary ſide, he that believeth and confeſſeth that Jeſus is the Lord, the true Son of God and our Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, hath ſurely learnt this of the holy Ghoſt, his outward teſtimony in the foreſaid evidence, and his inward teaching. (For do but truly believe the truth of Chriſt himſelf, and the truth of all his Doctrine will undeniably follow.)</p>
               <p n="4">4. Now there are diverſities of gifts, but the ſame Spirit. 5. And there are differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of adminiſtrations, but the ſame Lord. 6. And there are diverſities of operations, but it is the ſame God, which worketh all in all.</p>
               <p rend="small">4, 5, 6. And as Gifts are aſcribed to the Holy Ghoſt, and Adminiſtrations to the Son, and Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the Father Almighty; ſo in all theſe there is great diverſities, both of kinds and of degrees.</p>
               <p n="7">7. But the manifeſtation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withall.</p>
               <p rend="small">7. But all the gifts of the Spirit are given for the Churches edification, or to do good with. (Though ſome of them are found in unholy Men, who periſh in their ſin.)</p>
               <p n="8">8. For to one is given by the Spirit, the word of wiſdom; to another the word of knowledge by the ſame Spirit;</p>
               <p rend="small">8. The ſame Spirit maketh one eminently wiſe and prudent in applying ſacred Truth to the Caſe

of the Hearers; and it giveth another an eminent knowledge of ſacred Myſteries.</p>
               <p n="9">9. To another faith by the ſame Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the ſame Spirit;</p>
               <p rend="small">9. Another he maketh eminently ſtrong in Faith, for extraordinary Effects; and another hath the Gift of miraculous Healing of the Sick, (when the Spirit will have it done.)</p>
               <p n="10">10. To another the working of miracles; to another propheſie; to another diſcerning of Spirits; to another divers kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues.</p>

To another, other ſorts of powerful Miracles; to another, to ſpeak by immediate Inſpiration, either Predictions, or powerful Explications and Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Gods Word; to another, a quick and ſure Diſcerning whether Men pretending to the Spirit ſpeak from God or not; to another, the ſpeaking of divers Languages; to another, the Interpretation of thoſe Languages to them that underſtand them not.</p>
               <p n="11">11. But all theſe worketh that one and the ſelf-ſame Spirit, dividing to every man ſeverally as he will.</p>
               <p rend="small">11. And though theſe are very various, and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="12">12. For as the body is one, and hath ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo is Chriſt.</p>
               <p rend="small">12. For here <hi>One</hi> and <hi>Many</hi> well conſiſt: As the Natural Body is but One Body, but made of Many Members, differing in number, excellency, and office; ſo is Chriſt and his Church.</p>
               <p n="13">13. For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</p>

                  </gap>r as Sacramentally all viſible Members are baptized into one Univerſal Church of profeſſed Chriſtian, and drink the Cap of holy Union and Communion in the Lords Supper; ſo all true, living, ſaved Members are baptized by one Spirit into one Univerſal Church of true ſpiritual Chriſtians, and drink the true uniting Spirit of Communion.</p>
               <p n="14">14, 15, 16, 17. For the body is not one member, but many. If the foot ſhall ſay, Becauſe I am not the hand, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body? And if the ear ſhall ſay, Becauſe I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body? If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? if the whole were hearing, where were the ſmelling?</p>
               <p rend="small">14, 15, 16, 17. The Body is not one Member as to Number, Kind, or Office; but many united: And ſo in Chriſts Body the Church: If a miſtaken Chriſtian himſelf ſhould ſay, Becauſe I am low in place, Grace, or Gifts, I am none of the Church; this will not prove or make him none: Much leſs, if others, by falſe Cenſure or Church-tyranny, ſay he is none, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate him for diſſenting from their vain Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendages or Opinions. If all were of one Office, Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Complexion, or degree of Grace or Knowledge, who would be Rulers, and who Subjects? who Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, and who Learners? How many Offices of Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Charity would be unperformed? God hath not a Church on Earth where all Members are ſo wiſe, as beſides the Eſſentials of Chriſtianity, to know all the Integrals; much leſs, to know the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous little Accidents of Forms and Ceremonies, and all that is really or pretendedly Indifferent and Lawful (which Domineerers can invent) to be ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and ſo to be all united in ſuch things indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.</p>
               <p n="18">18. But now hath God ſet the members, every one of them in the body, as it hath pleaſed him. 19. And if they were all one member, where were the body? 20. But now are they many members, yet but one body.</p>
               <p rend="small">18, 19, 20. But as the Wiſe Creator in Nature, ſo as our Redeemer, Governor, and Regenerator by Grace, God hath choſen great diverſity of Members, as to Office and Gifts; and he himſelf, as it pleaſed him, hath ſet them in his Church. (And who are they that preſume againſt him, to cenſure or caſt out the meaneſt of ſuch?) Were they all numerically, or in Office, or degree of Knowledge and Grace, but one, or equal, the Church would not be ſuch a thing as God hath made it. But now God, that freely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth in the variety of his Works, hath made it one Body of Chriſt, compoſed of variety of Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</p>
               <p n="21">21. And the eye cannot ſay unto the hand, I have no need of thee: nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.</p>
               <p rend="small">21. As the principal Members of the Body need the leſs principal; ſo the Rulers, Paſtors, and wiſeſt Members of the Church need even thoſe weak and inferiour Chriſtians, whom ſurly Cenſurers, and proud or contentious Uſurpers, will caſt out.</p>
               <p n="22">22. Nay, much more thoſe members of the body which ſeem to be more feeble, are neceſſary.</p>
               <p rend="small">22. Yea, the Parts which are leaſt honoured, and feeble, have a peculiar neceſſary Office, which none of the reſt is able to perform or ſupply.</p>
               <p n="23">
                  <pb facs="tcp:66325:183"/>23. And thoſe members of the body, which we think to be leſs honourable, upon theſe we beſtow more abundant honour, and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p rend="small">23. And thoſe Parts which we account ſhameful, we moſt carefully clothe and cover, to hide either Deformity or Shame, (and do not reproach, neglect, or caſt away.)</p>
               <p n="24">24. For our comely parts have no need: but God hath tempered the body together, having given more abundant honour to that part which lacked: 25. That there ſhould be no ſchiſm in the body; but that the members ſhould have the ſame care one for another.</p>
               <p rend="small">24, 25. Our comely Parts need not our care to adorn and cover them from Shame: But God hath ſo contempered the Parts, that we ſhould more care to ſecure from diſhonour the Parts that need our care: That Unity and Love of the Whole ſhould cauſe ſuch Love and Care for every Part, that the Parts ſhould not envy, or ſtrive againſt, or cut off, or divide from one another.</p>
               <p rend="small">Note, 1. O how clean contrary to this are the tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Canons and Cruelties that cut off all Members that think any of their needleſs Impoſitions unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful!</p>
               <p rend="small">2. And here <hi>Paul</hi> tells us the true Cauſe of Schiſm: Not Weakneſs of Chriſtians, but the Butchery of that Clergy that cut off the Weak, when they ſhould carefully hide their Diſhonour in Love; and that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile them whom they ſhould love as themſelves.</p>
               <p n="26">26. And whether one member ſuffer, all the members ſuffer with it: or one member be honoured, all the members rejoyce with it.</p>
               <p rend="small">26. As all the Body condoleth or rejoiceth with the pain or welfare of every Member, even the weakeſt; ſo is it with the Living Members of Chriſt.</p>
               <p rend="small">
                  <hi>Note,</hi> Therefore they are but Hypocrites, like Wooden Legs, that have no ſuch ſenſe; and trayte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Enemies of Chriſt, that hate, and reproach, and deſtroy his true Members.</p>
               <p n="27">27. Now ye are the body of Chriſt, and members in particular.</p>

And if I be without this, could I preach, diſcourſe, and pray in better Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage and Oratory than any mortal Man, even as well as Angels, what were this Voice to God, that is a Spirit, and looketh to the Heart, but even as the tinkling of a Muſical Inſtrument?</p>

               <p rend="small">9, 10. For here the manner of our knowing in the Body is imperfect, and the meaſure is all inadequate: we know nothing wholly, but ſome part of things; and ſo we ſpeak, even in Propheſying and Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: But Perfection will end all this Imperfection.</p>
               <p n="11">11. When I was a child, I ſpake as a child, I underſtood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childiſh things.</p>

               <p rend="small">12. For our Knowledge now in this Body and World, is by imperfect <hi>Media,</hi> as we ſee things in a Glaſs; and know by Riddles, Parables, or Similitudes, a ſuperficial Glimpſe: But then we ſhall know as Men that ſee each others Faces, by intuition.

The <hi>Engliſh</hi> abuſe of the Word [<hi>charity</hi>] deceiveth many, as if it were nothing but Giving to the Poor; But it is the Love of God and Holineſs, and of holy Perſons, and of our Neighbours as our ſelves; and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of the holy Celeſtial Society, Chriſt, Angels, and Saints.</p>

                  <p n="6">6. It's made a doubt by ſome, Whether Faith and Hope continue not in Heaven; becauſe, ſay they, How ſhall we know things paſt, (as the Creation, Flood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) but by Believing? And ſhall we not Believe and Hope for the Perpetuity of Glory? But, 1. We know not now in what manner God will make known things to us there: Whether in ſeeing him, we ſhall ſee all things? or how? 2. However, it will not be the ſame things that are called <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Hope,</hi> which are exerciſed on Promiſes, and are but Means to that Perfection which is their End: So that if you call them by the ſame Names, they will be but equivocal.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. This much tells us what Meaſure of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Hope</hi> are neceſſary to Salvation, <hi>viz.</hi> ſo much as ſhall cauſe in us ſincere Love to God and Holineſs, and Heaven, to one another.</p>

               <p n="1">1. FOllow after charity, and deſire ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual gifts, but rather that ye may propheſie.</p>
               <p rend="small">1. The ſum of my Advice is, That above all you value and purſue Charity, (or holy Love:) But deſire alſo Spiritual Gifts, in ſubordination to it, and for the profitable exerciſe of it; and therefore prefer Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, (which is ſpeaking by immediate Inſpiration; to the Inſtruction and Edification of others) as moſt profitable.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For he that ſpeaketh in an unknown tongue, ſpeaketh not unto men, but unto God: for no man underſtandeth him; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit in the ſpirit he ſpeaketh myſteries.</p>
               <p rend="small">2. For he that ſpeaketh in an unknown Language, ſpeaketh not to the Underſtanding of Man, though God underſtand him: For though he ſpeak never ſo high and excellent Myſteries, no Man that knoweth not that Language underſtandeth him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But he that propheſieth, ſpeaketh unto men to edification, and exhortation, and comfort.</p>
               <p rend="small">3. But he that intelligibly applieth Gods Word to the Hearers, ſpeaketh ſo as conduceth to their Edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and Exhortation, and Comfort, which are the Ends of your Aſſemblies.</p>
               <p n="4">4. He that ſpeaketh in an <hi>unknown</hi> tongue, edifieth himſelf: but he that propheſieth edifieth the church.</p>
               <p rend="small">4. It is ſuppoſed, that he that ſpeaketh in a Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage unknown to the People, underſtandeth it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and ſo may be edified himſelf: (For the Spirit of God did not move Men to ſpeak like Parrots, they knew not what.) But he that by Gods Spirit inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth and exhorteth others, edifieth the Church; for which End you meet.</p>
               <p n="5">5. I would that ye all ſpake with tongues, but rather that ye propheſied; for greater is
<pb facs="tcp:66325:185"/>
he that propheſieth, then he that ſpeaketh with tongues, except he interpret, that the church may receive edifying.</p>
               <p rend="small">5. I would you had all ſuch knowledge of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages as is uſeful to propagate the Goſpel: But I more wiſh, as <hi>Moſes,</hi> that all the Lords People were Prophets, that is, inſpired to ſpeak wiſely and zealouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Will of God to Men. For he is the Greateſt in the Church, who is moſt Edifying; and that is he that propheſieth, more than he that ſpeaketh ſtrange Language, unleſs he interpret it to the Churches Edification.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Now brethren, if I come unto you ſpeaking with tougues, what ſhall I profit you, except I ſhall ſpeak to you either by reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, or by knowledge, or by propheſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or by doctrine?</p>

               <p n="7">7. And even things without life giving ſound, whether pipe or harp, except they give a diſtinction in the ſounds, how ſhall it be known what is piped or harped?</p>
               <p rend="small">7. Even the ſound of lifeleſs things, as Muſical In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, being uſed for ſome ſignification, are uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, if by diſtinction their ſignification be not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible.</p>
               <p n="8">8. For if the trumpet give an uncertain ſound, who ſhall prepare himſelf to the battel?</p>
               <p rend="small">8. You may learn this of Soldiers, how vain the unintelligible Sound of the Trumpet is.</p>
               <p n="9">9. So likewiſe you, except ye utter by the tongue words eaſie to be underſtood, how ſhall it be known what is ſpoken? for ye ſhall ſpeak into the air.</p>
               <p rend="small">9. So if you ſpeak not intelligibly to the Hearers, what the better are they? You do but ſpeak into the air.</p>
               <p n="10">10. There are, it may be, ſo many kinds of voices in the world, and none of them is without ſignification.</p>
               <p rend="small">10. Even the Voices of Birds and Beaſts have their uſeful ſignificancy to Man, and to one another: much more of Men.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Therefore if I know not the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the voice, I ſhall be unto him that ſpeaketh, a barbarian; and he that ſpeaketh ſhall be a barbarian unto me.</p>
               <p rend="small">11. Therefore what I underſtand not, is of no mor uſe to me, than to a Barbarian of another Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Even ſo ye, for as much as ye are zealous of ſpiritual gifts, ſeek that ye may excel to the edifying of the church.</p>
               <p rend="small">12. Therefore as you much deſire Spiritual Gifts, prefer thoſe that moſt edifie, and ſeek them not for vain glory.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Wherefore let him that ſpeaketh in an unknown tongue, pray that he may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret.</p>
               <p rend="small">13. Let him that hath the Gifts of Languages, pray for the Gift of edifying Interpretation.</p>
               <p n="14">14. For if I pray in an unknown tongue, my ſpirit prayeth, but my underſtanding is unfruitful.</p>
               <p rend="small">14. If I pray in an unknown Tongue, my Spirit prayeth, but others underſtand me not, and cannot profitably join with me.</p>
               <p n="15">15. What is it then? I will pray with the ſpirit, and I will pray with the underſtanding alſo: I will ſing with the ſpirit, and I will ſing with the underſtanding alſo.</p>
               <p rend="small">15. Therefore when I pray or ſing by the Gift of unknown Tongues, I will alſo pray and ſing intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gibly, for edification.</p>
               <p n="16">16. Elſe when thou ſhalt bleſs with the ſpirit, how ſholl he that occupieth the room, of the unlearned, ſay Amen at thy giving of thanks, ſeeing he underſtandeth not what thou ſayeſt.</p>
               <p rend="small">16. If others join not with thee, it is but a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Exerciſe, and not a Church-exerciſe: And how ſhall the Vulgar join by conſent, and ſay, <hi>Amen,</hi> to what they do not underſtand?</p>
               <p n="17">17. For thou verily giveſt thanks well, but the other is not edified.</p>
               <p rend="small">17. Thy Thankſgiving is a good Work; but what is another or the Church the wiſer for it?</p>

               <p n="22">22. Wherefore tongues are for a ſign, not to them that believe, but to them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not: but propheſying ſerveth not for them that believe not, but for them which believe.</p>
               <p rend="small">22. So that the miraculous Gift of Languages is to convince Unbelievers, of that which the Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth already: But Prophetical opening the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Chriſt, for further edification, is appointed for them that are already Believers.</p>
               <p n="23">23. If therefore the whole church be come together into one place, and all ſpeak with tongues, and there come in thoſe that are unlearned, or unbelievers, will they not ſay that ye are mad?</p>
               <p rend="small">23. Surely you ſhould not meet or worſhip God ſcandalouſly, like mad Men: But if the whole Church do meet in one place, (as Churches then did) and all ſpeak in unknown Tongues, the Unlearned and Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers will take you all for mad Phanaticks.</p>
               <p n="24">24. But if all propheſie, and there come in one that believeth not, or one unlearned, he is convinced of all, he is judged of all:</p>
               <p rend="small">24. But if all that ſpeak do by Gods Spirit uſe convincing Evidence in Explication and Application, they all convince him, and ſhew him his Condition.</p>
               <p n="25">25. And thus are the ſecrets of his heart made manifeſt; and ſo falling down on his face, he will worſhip God, and report that God is in you of a truth.</p>

                  <p n="1">I. IT's a Doubt oft put, How it could be that Gods Spirit ſhould inſpire Men with Tongues or Prophecy, and yet not tell them when and how to uſe them? But it's not to be thought, that he that was before without the Habit, had the actual Uſe of them, then ſuddenly inſpired; but that, as the Learned, ſo the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired had the habitual Knowledge of Tongues before they aſſembled, and ſo for the actual Uſe and Time, were to exerciſe their own Diſcretion.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. The Deſcription of the Church here, oft named as meeting in one Place with their Officers and Guides, tells us, that then a Church of this Rank was not a Dioceſs of many hundred Aſſemblies, which had all but one Biſhop, their Conſtitutive Head; but that it was a Company aſſociated for Perſonal Communion, that uſually met in one Place; though Neceſſity might make them meet in many, and tho ſome General Guides might take care of many ſuch Churches.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. The greater number of Prophets, and Teachers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that were here in one Aſſembly, whoſe Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes the Apoſtle was put to reſtrain, doth fully confute Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi>'s oft-repeated Opinion, That in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-times there is no Proof that there were any more Presbyters to one Church, than one, who was a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, and had Deacons under him; and that for want of capable Perſons. But his Opinion inferreth, That then a Church was no greater than could meet in one Place: For one Biſhop could not be at once in many. And if no Subject-Presbyters were made in Scripture-times, it muſt be proved by what juſt Power they were after made, even a ſort of Paſtors never made by the Apoſtles</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. The Arguments of the Apoſtle againſt the uninterrupted Uſe of Tongues not underſtood in the Church, are ſo many, cogent, plain, and vehement, that I will not loſe time to anſwer the Papiſts Cavils againſt them, when they defend their <hi>Latin</hi> Maſſes and Prayers; but only note, That nothing can be ſo plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpoken by Gods own Spirit, which Carnal prejudiced Men cannot pervert; and that it is no wonder if they will not be judged and ruled by Gods Word, unleſs they themſelves may be Judges of the Senſe of it; and how little Gods Word ſignifieth to the People, where it muſt have ſuch Expoſitors and Judges.</p>
                  <p>One that knew no more againſt the Papal Kingdom, called the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> than, 1. Their <hi>Latin</hi> Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and cheriſhing of Ignorance: 2. And that as Leeches they live on Blood, and keep up their Religion by violent Cruelty; if he have but read this 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. and Chriſts Commands for loving each other; yea, if he have not loſt much of Humanity it ſelf, I think, can hardly be a Papiſt.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. The Pretence that ſome fetch hence, for any Man that will to ſpeak in the Church, if he think he is inſpired, is utterly vain: For that leave is here reſtrained to Inſpired Prophets, and thoſe to be regulated by the Laws of Order, Decency, and Edification. And God hath made it the Office of the Paſtors, to be Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers in the Aſſemblies.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. The abuſe of the General Rules by Papiſt Uſurping Church-Lords and Canoniſts, is notorious; who, becauſe Gods own Ordinances muſt, as to Modes and Circumſtances, be managed Decently, Orderly, and to Edification, thence plead for a Dominion to add many Symbolical Rites and Ordinances of their own, which <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> never knew, to make Gods Ordinances ſeem Decent, Orderly, and to Edification, even things

               <p n="1">1. MOreover, brethren, I declare unto you the goſpel which I preached unto you, which alſo you have received, and wherein ye ſtand; 2. By which alſo ye are ſaved, if ye keep in memory what I preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto you, unleſs ye have believed in vain.</p>
               <p rend="small">1, 2. And becauſe ſome endeavour to ſubvert your Faith, I will recite the ſum of that Goſpel which I preached to you, and in which you have ſince conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued and which is the ſure and ſufficient Doctrine of Salvation, (though the Articles be few) without all the corrupt Additions invented by proud erroneous Men; unleſs your Belief of them have been unſound and ſuperficial, and ſo in vain. See that your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound Belief deceive you not, and this Goſpel will not deceive you.</p>
               <p n="3">3. For I delivered unto you firſt of all that which I alſo received, how that Chriſt died for our ſins according to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
               <p rend="small">3. For I told you, that Chriſt died as a voluntary Sacrifice for our Sins, therein fulfilling what was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied of him. This I received from God by Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and from the certain Witneſſes by juſt Report and Evidence.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And that he was buried, and that he roſe again the third day according to the ſcriptures: 5. And that he was ſeen of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas, then of the twelve. 6. After that, he was ſeen of above five hundred brethren at once: of whom the greater part remain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this preſent, but ſome are fallen aſleep.</p>
               <p rend="small">4, 5, 6. And as the Scripture foretold, he was bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, and roſe again the third day, and appeared to <hi>Peter,</hi> and after to the ſpecial Diſciples, who were Twelve before <hi>Judas</hi>'s Defection, and after. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that [it's like, in <hi>Galilee</hi>] he was ſeen of Five hundred, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. After that, he was ſeen of James, then of all the apoſtles.</p>
               <p rend="small">7. <hi>Note,</hi> That it's not to be wondred at, that this Appearance to <hi>James,</hi> and to the Five hundred, are not before diſtinctly mentioned in the Goſpel, when St. <hi>John</hi> tells us how ſmall a part of what Chriſt did is written. And as one Evangeliſt hath ſome things which the other omit, ſo if <hi>Paul</hi> have ſome which all four omitted, the ſame Spirit recordeth them all.</p>
               <p n="8">8. And laſt of all he was ſeen of me alſo, as of one born out of due time.</p>
               <p rend="small">8. And after all theſe he appeared to me from Heaven, as to one that was too late converted.</p>
               <p n="9">9. For I am the leaſt of the apoſtles, that am not meet to be called an apoſtle, becauſe I perſecuted the church of God.</p>
               <p rend="small">9. For my perſecuting Gods Church maketh me ſo unworthy to be numbred with the Apoſtles, that though God called me to be one, I muſt eſteem my ſelf as the laſt, ſo the leaſt of them, or below the Twelve.</p>
               <p n="10">10. But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was beſtowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, was not in vain; but I laboured more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.</p>
               <p rend="small">10. But Gods free Grace hath called me to this Honour and Work: and his Grace given hath not been in vain; for (though I came late in, and was a Perſecutor) I have ſince been more laborious than any of them all: which I aſcribe not to my ſelf, but to God's free Grace, which choſe, called, inſtructed, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited, and ſtrengthned me.</p>

               <p n="16">16. For if the dead riſe not, then is not Chriſt raiſed: 17, And if Chriſt be not raiſed, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your ſins.</p>

The Celeſtial Bodies greatly differ from the Earthly Bodies; and ſo do even the Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtial among themſelves; as the Sun from the Moon, and one Star from another, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And ſo ſhall our Bodies at the Reſurrection greatly differ from theſe that we have now; particularly, by being incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible.</p>
               <p n="43">43. It is ſown in diſhonour it is raiſed in glory: it is ſown in weakneſs, it is raiſed in power: 44. It is ſown a natural body, it is raiſed a ſpiritual body. There is a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral body, and there is a ſpiritual body.</p>
               <p rend="small">43, 44. It is now ſo vile a Body, that it muſt rot and corrupt in darkneſs in the Earth; but it ſhall riſe in Glory. It is buried in utter impotency, like the common Earth; but Gods Power ſhall raiſe it a Powerful Body. It is buried like the Body of a Beaſt, that was paſſive, and only <hi>acted</hi> by the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Soul; but it ſhall riſe a Spiritual Body, more ſuited to the Nature of the Soul, and having alſo an active Nature (like as Fire hath) in it ſelf. Thare are Natural Bodies, of Paſſive Matter, in daily flux, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired by Food, and acted only by other Natures, or Souls: And there are Spiritual Bodies, (either ſuch as the Sun and Light hath, or higher) which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible, and of themſelves not inclined to death, diſſolution, or change, and beſides the Soul, are ſo like it, that they are themſelves Active Natures.</p>
               <p n="45">45. And ſo it is written, The firſt man
<pb facs="tcp:66325:188"/>
Adam was made a living ſoul, the laſt Adam was made a quickning ſpirit.</p>
               <p rend="small">45. That is, The firſt <hi>Adam</hi> was made by God a living Soul, put into a corruptible Body, not having an unchangeable State in himſelf, nor Power to make his Poſterity ſuch; But the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> had in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unchangeable Life, ſuited to a ſpiritual, glorious State, and was the Root of ſuch to his Believing Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, enabled, as the Lord of Life, to riſe himſelf, aſcend to Heaven, and to raiſe them to Life, and take them to himſelf, and to make them a ſpiritual, holy People, capable thereof.</p>
               <p n="46">46. Howbeit, that was not firſt which is ſpiritual, but that which is natural; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward that which is ſpiritual.</p>
               <p rend="small">46. But the Animal Perſon, from whom by Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration we have but meer Nature, was to us in cauſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, before him that conveyeth to us Spiritual and Everlaſting Life. Our Nature derived from <hi>Adam</hi> was before the Reparation, Spiritual Holineſs, Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, or Glory given by Chriſt; even as <hi>Adam</hi> was before Chriſts own Incarnation and Reſurrection. Perfection is the laſt and ripe State of Gods Work in our Salvation.</p>
               <p n="47">47. The firſt man is of the earth, earthy: the ſecond man is the Lord from heaven.</p>
               <p rend="small">47. <hi>Adam</hi> was made out of the Duſt of the Paſſive Elements; though God breathed into him a Living Soul, yet Earth was his firſt abode: But Chriſt is the Lord from Heaven; his Divine Nature being there from everlaſting, aſſumed the Humane by the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhadowing of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p n="48">48. As is the earthy, ſuch are they alſo that are earthy: and as is the heavenly, ſuch are they alſo that are heavenly.</p>
               <p rend="small">48. And as <hi>Adam</hi> was a Natural Man, and the Root of ſuch; ſo it is but Nature which we have from him: And as Chriſt is Heavenly and Spiritual, ſo will he make all the holy Seed to be like him, Spiritual and Heavenly.</p>
               <p n="49">49. And as we have born the image of the earthy, we ſhall alſo bear the image of the heavenly.</p>
               <p rend="small">49. And as we are born of <hi>Adam,</hi> Men, as he was; ſo we ſhall be made by Chriſt Spiritual and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly, as he is.</p>
               <p n="50">50. Now this I ſay, brethren, that fleſh and blood cannot inherit the Kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.</p>
               <p rend="small">50. And this I tell you, That theſe Bodies muſt not come to Heaven in the proper Form of Fleſh and Blood, nor can as ſuch poſſeſs it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for, as ſuch, they are corruptible, and cannot ſo inherit Heaven, which is incorruptible.</p>
               <p n="51">51. Behold, I ſhew you a myſtery; We ſhall not all ſleep, but we ſhall all be changed,</p>
               <p rend="small">51. And I will tell you that which is commonly unknown: Though the Juſt ſhall not die that are alive at Chriſts coming, they ſhall all be changed, as well as thoſe that riſe from the Dead, from being proper Fleſh and Blood, to have Spiritual Bodies.</p>
               <p n="52">52. In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the laſt trump, (for the trumpet ſhall ſound) and the dead ſhall be raiſed incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible, and we ſhall be changed.</p>
               <p rend="small">52. In a moment Chriſts potent Call will be like a Trumpet, calling Men together; and the Dead ſhall be raiſed, and living Saints changed into an incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible ſtate.</p>
               <p n="53">53. For this corruptible muſt put on in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruption, and this mortal muſt put on im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality.</p>
               <p rend="small">53. For this mortal Body and Compoſition, which is now corruptible by Diſſolution, muſt be changed into an incorruptible and immortal ſtate of Being and Habitation.</p>
               <p n="54">54. So when this corruptible ſhall have put on incorruption, and this mortal ſhall have put on immortality, then ſhall be brought to paſs the ſaying that is written, Death is ſwallowed up in victory.</p>
               <p rend="small">54. And Death being conquered by Chriſt, (being a Fruit of Sin, from which he ſaveth us) we ſhall die no more.</p>
               <p n="55">55. O death, where is thy ſting? O grave, where is thy victory? 56. The ſting of death is ſin; and the ſtrength of ſin is the law.</p>
               <p rend="small">55. Though now Death ſeem to conquer us, we triumph over it by Faith in Chriſt, foreſeeing our Reſurrection: being ſaved from Sin, which is the Sting, and the Penal Law or Curſe, which is Sins condemning Strength.</p>
               <p n="57">57. But thanks be to God which giveth us the victory, through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p rend="small">57. But by Faith, which ſeeth things to come, we give God thanks, that will raiſe us from the Dead, and give us final Victory over Death through Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="58">58. Therefore my beloved brethren, be ye ſtedfaſt, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, for as much ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.</p>
               <p rend="small">58. And now, Brethren, make this neceſſary uſe of all. Seeing our Faith and Hope of a Reſurrection and future Life aſſureth us, that none of our Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Labour or Suffering ſhall be in vain, or to our loſs, or without a glorious Reward; what remaineth, but that againſt all Temptations you be ſteadfaſt and unmovable, and do Gods Work with all your Power, abounding in Labour and Patience to the end?</p>

                  <head>ANNOTATIONS.</head>
                  <p>AS this Chapter is of great uſe for our Inſtruction, ſo it is not without many Difficulties to our Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. It's needful to be obſerved, into how narrow a room <hi>Paul</hi> reduceth the Goſpel, or Articles of Faith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Chriſt; and how greatly herein they differ from him, that condemn, excommunicate, or perſecute thoſe who believe Theſe, and all the Bible beſides, if they ſubſcribe not to the Truth of all their Articles and Forms ſuperadded, and the juſtneſs of their numerous Canons.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. The Apparition of Chriſt to the Five hundred, and to <hi>James,</hi> ſeemeth part of that which St. <hi>John</hi> ſaith was not by him written: So that part of the Evidence of Chriſts Reſurrection ſhould be enough to cauſe us to believe it.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. Though it was but <hi>ſome</hi> at <hi>Corinth</hi> that denied the Reſurrection, the Church was faulty in bearing with them: yet Separation from that Church for their ſakes is not required, nor allowed by the Apoſtle.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. The <hi>Socinians</hi> from the 19th. Verſe, and divers others, gather, That <hi>Paul</hi> denieth the Felicity of our Souls before the Reſurrection, becauſe he intimateth, That if there were no Reſurrection, (but only an Immortality of the Soul) Chriſtians were the moſt miſerable Men, and their Faith and Sufferings vain, and they were yet in their Sins, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Matter is weighty, and the Solution hath its Difficulty. Some ſay, That becauſe the Heretical denied the Immortality of the Soul, as well as the Reſurrection of the Body, <hi>Paul</hi> ſuppoſeth this, and anſwereth them as to both: And they ſay, That <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> ſignifying but to <hi>ſtand up,</hi> that is, to live again, includeth the Life of the Separated Soul, as well as the Reſurrection of the Body. Others ſay, That <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh only of the <hi>Man,</hi> and not of the Soul alone, which is but part of the Man. Soul and Body are eſſential to a Man; and as a <hi>Man</hi> he may be miſerable, becauſe part is ſo, (as a Tooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach is to the whole Body) though the Soul be happy. Others ſay, That the Felicity or perfect Man at the Reſurrection will be ſo much greater than that of the Separated Soul before, and alſo that this Separate State is ſo darkly revealed to us, that the Apoſtle maketh light of it in compariſon of the latter. The firſt of theſe Opinions is not inconſiderable; but the chief Anſwer is by a ſtricter Expoſition of the particular Texts. And, 1. Verſe 19. argueth thus: [If we believe in, and ſuffer for a Chriſt as riſen, who is not riſen, then he cannot ſave us either as to Soul or Body; and then we are the moſt miſerable ſort of Men. For our Hopes in him, for the Time and Things of this Life only, affords us leſs than others have, his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom being not of this World] This Argument is not againſt, but for the Immortality of the Soul.</p>
                  <p>So Verſe 32. [<hi>What advantageth it me if the dead riſe not?] i. e.</hi> Neither Soul nor Body is advantaged by ſuffering for a Chriſt as riſen, who is not riſen.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. The Compariſon of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> is as hard, ſeeming to mean, that <hi>Adam</hi>'s Soul, and his Poſterities, as ſuch, are not Immortal. But indeed it implieth no more than this: 1. That it's called, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. <hi>a Living Soul,</hi> but Chriſt <hi>the Lord of Life.</hi> 2. That <hi>Adam</hi> had but a Soul breathed into him by Creation on Earth; but Chriſt was in Heaven from Everlaſting, the Living God. 3. That <hi>Adam</hi> propagated only Humanity; but Chriſt alſo Sanctity and Felicity. 4. That <hi>Adam</hi> by Nature had but a loſeable Capacity of Bodily Life continued, and Heavenly Felicity; and by Sin came ſhort of both: But Chriſt hath Life in himſelf, as the Root of Holineſs and Happineſs in Heaven, which he will give Believers, both to their Souls and Bodies; and will give a Bodily Reſurrection to all Men.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. Ver. 24. The Kingdom delivered up to the Father, is but that Government which Chriſt uſeth to recover and ſave Sinners, and is no addition to the Father, nor diminution to Chriſt: But as a Prince under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking to reduce Rebels, layeth down his Commiſſion and Arms when he hath done his Work, and yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth his own Honour; or as a Phyſician giveth up his Hoſpital, when he hath healed all the Sick. And it is like, yea, certain, that when Chriſts acquiſitive Mediation is finiſhed, he will ſtill be ſome ſort of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator of our Fruition: For we ſhall ſtill behold his Glory.</p>
                  <p n="7">VII. Ver. 37.39. ſeem to intimate, That the Body that ſhall riſe is not the ſame that was ſowed, but ſuch a Body as God pleaſeth a new to give. Doubtleſs it is the ſame in ſome reſpect, and not the ſame in an reſpects: And to be able to know juſt how far it is or is not the ſame, is too hard for us, and may be qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly left to the Will of God. The Seminal part of the Grain (Matter and Form) liveth in the new Fruit, in which it ſpringeth up, (as the Seminal part of Man begins his Being in the Womb) but the added Maſs which makes up the Root, the Stalk, and Ear, and new Grains, are all drawn from without, from the Water, Earth, and Air, by God, and by the Seminal Spirit. We ſee that Men oft grow Fleſhy, Fat, and Lean again, and at laſt die with little but a skinned Skeleton: I think few believe, that either Men dying Fat ſhall riſe Fat, or Men dying Lean ſhall riſe Lean; or yet that every Man ſhall riſe with all the Fleſh which he ever lived or ſinned in, and which daily paſſed away, or conſumed in Sickneſs. To know how much, and what goeth to identifie the Body, we muſt leave to God, if we will not pretend to the knowledge we have not. Nor is it neceſſary to believe, that all Fowls, Beaſts, and Fiſhes riſe again, and go to Heaven, which are ever digeſted, and made Humane Fleſh.</p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle likening our Bodies to Seed, maketh ſome to doubt whether the dead Body have a Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb facs="tcp:66325:189"/>
by any Seminal Vertue, as a Natural Cauſe, or only riſe by Miracle. The latter is moſt commonly held: And yet it is certain, that the Soul taketh with it a Love and Inclination to its Body, which is a ſort of Seminal Diſpoſition. And no mortal Man knoweth whether the Soul take not with it ſome of the Igneous Spirits by which it here operated as ſuch a Body, as Seminal Vertue in Inferior things is lodged in them; and whether at the Reſurrection God uſe that Compoſition of Igneous Matter (or Ethereal) and Spiritual Form, for the aggregation of ſo much more ſuch Matter as ſhall be needful to make up the Glorious, Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, Incorruptible Body. But all this, and how much of the Fleſh we lived in God will raiſe, is to us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known.</p>
                  <p n="8">VIII. Ver. 50. That Fleſh and Blood cannot enter into the Kingdom of God, is groſly perverted by them that ſay, That it's only Sinful Fleſh that is meant; or them that ſay, That Fleſh and Blood ſhall enter, but incorruptible. It is proper formal Fleſh and Blood that the Apoſtle mentioneth. Fleſh is the Blood, and other nutritive Juyce, coagulated into that Fibrous Subſtance ſo called, and is the Matter of Food digeſted and aſſimilated unto this. It is made of Earth, Water, and Air; and ſo is Blood. Define them, and nothing that is in Heaven will agree with that Definition. If ſuch Earth ſhall be placed in Heaven<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it will ceaſe by tranſmutation to be Earth. To call a Spiritual, Incorruptible, Glorious Body, Earth and Water, or Fleſh and Blood, and place theſe with the Bleſſed Spirits, is but to equivocate, and not to uſe the Words univo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally. The two General Councils (<hi>Nice</hi> ſecond, and <hi>Conſtance</hi> before it) differing in other things, agree That Chriſts true Body is in Heaven, but that there it is not Fleſh and Blood: (And yet the Papiſts feign, that he hath ſtill real Fleſh and Blood in the Sacrament.)</p>
                  <p>Doubtleſs by a Spiritual Body is meant one that is ſo near the Nature of a Spirit, as is fitteſt for ſpiritual and glorious Work; which made many of the Fathers ſay, That it will be an Ethereal, or Igneous, or Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous Body. But Gods Knowledge muſt be implicitly reſted in, when we have no explicit Knowledge.</p>

               <p n="1">1. PAul an apoſtle of Jeſus Chriſt by the will of God, and Timothy our bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, unto the church of God [which is at Corinth, with all the ſaints which are in all Achaia:] 2. Grace be to you, and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p rend="small">1, 2. When it is read to the Church at <hi>Corinth,</hi> to whom it is ſpecially directed, to be communicated to others in <hi>Achaia</hi> by them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Bleſſed be God even the father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort; 4. Who comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith we our ſelves are comforted of God.</p>
               <p rend="small">3, 4. —[By the ſame Reaſons that comforted me, and by the experience of his Mercies, which gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth me a comforting frame of Mind.</p>
               <p n="5">5. For as the ſufferings of Chriſt abound in us, ſo our conſolation alſo aboundeth by Chriſt.</p>
               <p rend="small">
                  <pb facs="tcp:66325:190"/>5. As I ſuffer more than others for Chriſt, ſo I have proportionable comfort by Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And whether we be afflicted, it is for your conſolation and ſalvation, which is effectual in the enduring of the ſame ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings which we alſo ſuffer: or whether we be comforted, it is for your conſolation and ſalvation.</p>
               <p rend="small">6. So great is the love of God to you, that both our afflictions and our comforts are intended as means to your comfort; that you may the eaſilier ſuffer as we do, and hope for that comfort that we enjoy, and that all may further your Salvation.</p>
               <p n="7">7. And our hope of you is ſtedfaſt, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that as you are partakers of the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, ſo ſhall ye be alſo of the conſolation.</p>
               <p rend="small">7. Therefore I hope that ſuffering will not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw your Faith, while you look for the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation.</p>
               <p n="8">8. For we would not, brethren, have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in Aſia, that we were preſſed out of meaſure above ſtrength, inſomuch that we deſpaired even of life:</p>
               <p rend="small">8. I would have you know how great our ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings were in <hi>Aſia,</hi> even beyond our own ſtrength to bear them, and ſuch as put me in expectation of death.</p>
               <p n="9">9. But we had the ſentence of death in our ſelves, that we ſhould not truſt in our ſelves, but in God which raiſeth the dead.</p>
               <p rend="small">9. But God brought me to this expectation of death, that I might not truſt to my preſent life, but unto God alone, and that as one that can raiſe the dead, and give them a better life hereafter, than that which they lay down for Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Who delivered us from ſo great a death, and doth deliver: in whom we truſt that he will yet deliver us: 11. You alſo helping together by prayer for us, that for the gift beſtowed upon us by the means of many perſons, thanks may be given by many on our behalf.</p>
               <p rend="small">10, 11. Who hath delivered us from ſo terrible a kind of Death, and ſtill doth deliver us, and we hope will do till our Work be done: But your Prayers muſt concur as the Means, that God alſo may have all your Thanks.</p>
               <p n="12">12. For our rejoycing is this, the teſti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mony of our conſcience, that in ſimplicity and godly ſincerity, not with fleſhly wiſdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our converſation in the world, and more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly to you-wards</p>
               <p rend="small">12. <hi>Note,</hi> 1. That a Chriſtian muſt have rejoicing not only in Chriſts Merits, but in the Conſcience of his own Sincerity. 2. Sincerity is much in Simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, and contrary to ſelf-ſeeking fleſhly Wiſdom. 3. It is Gods Grace that giveth this Sincerity. 4. Where it is uſed in eminent Self-denial, it may lawfully be gloried in againſt D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="13">13. For we write none other things unto you, then what you read or acknowledge, and I truſt you ſhall acknowledge even to the end.</p>
               <p rend="small">13. For I willingly expoſe my ſelf and Doctrine to your Trial; I write but the ſame things which you have received and own, and I hope will own even to the end.</p>
               <p n="14">14. As alſo you have acknowledged us in part, that we are your rejoycing, even as ye alſo are ours in the day of the Lord Jeſus.</p>
               <p rend="small">14. As I my ſelf have been owned by you as your Comfort, though I have ſome Accuſers, even as you are my Comfort when I render an Account of my Miniſtry to Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="15">15. And in this confidence I was minded to come unto you before, that you might have a ſecond benefit:</p>
               <p rend="small">15. And in confidence of this our mutual Love, I purpoſed to come to you, for the increaſe of your Graces.</p>
               <p n="16">16. And to paſs by you into Macedonia, and to come again out of Macedonia unto you, and of you to be brought on my way toward Judea.</p>
               <p rend="small">16. When I carry the Contribution to <hi>Judea.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="17">17. When I therefore was thus minded, did I uſe lightneſs? or the things that I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, do I purpoſe according to the fleſh, that with me there ſhould be yea, yea, and nay, nay? 18. But as God is true, our word toward you, is not yea and nay.</p>
               <p rend="small">17, 18. What I purpoſed was with ſubmiſſion to Gods Providence and Will. Had any cauſe then to accuſe me of Levity and Falſhood in my Promiſes, as if my Word were not to be credited? I take God to witneſs, that I ſpake my real Purpoſe in truth, though I was hindred from Performance.</p>
               <p n="19">19. For the ſon of God, Jeſus Chriſt, who as preached among you by us, even by me, and Sylvanus, and Timotheus, was not yea and nay, but in him was yea. 20. For all the promiſes of God in him are <hi>Yea,</hi> and in him <hi>Amen,</hi> unto the glory of God by us.</p>
               <p rend="small">19, 20. And more abuſive is it hence to gather my Incredibility in preaching, and the uncertainty of my Doctrine: For Chriſt whom we preached is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Saviour, and his Promiſes all ſure, and are ſealed,
<pb facs="tcp:66325:190"/>
confirmed, and proved to Gods Glory, in the Power of our Miniſtry.</p>
               <p n="21">21. Now he which ſtabliſheth us with you in Chriſt, and hath anointed us, is God: 22. Who hath alſo ſealed us, and given the earneſt of the ſpirit in our hearts.</p>
               <p rend="small">21, 22. And it is God himſelf who ſtabliſheth both us and you in Chriſt, and hath anointed and ſealed us, and given us the Earneſt of his Spirit, which is his Pledge, and our Security.</p>
               <p n="23">23. Moreover, I call God for a record upon my ſoul, that to ſpare you I came not as yet unto Corinth.</p>
               <p rend="small">23. I do by Oath call God himſelf to witneſs, that my not coming yet to you, was not out of any ſuch Falſhood, Levity, or Self-reſpect as my Accuſers inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate; but I delayed, as foreſeeing how unpleaſing it would be to have exerciſed the Severity among you, which your Sin, before Repentance, required.</p>
               <p n="24">24. Not for that we have dominion over your faith, but are helpers of your joy: for by faith ye ſtand.</p>
               <p rend="small">24. Not that we are Lords over your Faith, or have any power to change it; but our Preaching and Diſcipline is to help your Joy, by caſting out Sin, and by ſtabliſhing you in Faith, in and by which you muſt ſtand and live.</p>

               <p n="1">1, 2. BUt I determined this with my ſelf, that I would not come again to you in heavineſs. For if I make you ſorry, who is he then that maketh me glad, but the ſame which is made ſorry by me?</p>
               <p rend="small">1, 2. But the true cauſe of my delay to come to you, was, that having reproved you for many Sins, which required ſharper Cenſure if you had not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owned them, I was not forward to grieve you by ſuch diſpleaſing Work, and ſtaid to hear of your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. For your Grief is my own; and none can take it from me, but your ſelves, by your Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And I wrote this ſame unto you, leſt when I came, I ſhould have ſorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoyce, having confidence in you all, that my joy is the joy of you all.</p>
               <p rend="small">3. And I gave you my Reproof by a Letter, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="4">4. For out of much affliction and anguiſh of heart, I wrote unto you with many tears; not that you ſhould be grieved, but that ye might know the love which I have more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly unto you.</p>
               <p rend="small">4. For I was ſo far from inſulting over you, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring your hurt, that I performed that neceſſary part of my Office with great grief and anguiſh, and wrote to you with many tears; not delighting to grieve you, but to ſhew my Love for your Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Salvation.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But if any have cauſed grief, he hath not grieved me, but in part: that I may not overcharge you all.</p>
               <p rend="small">5. But the Grief which I had by the Sins of ſome particular Perſons, I am far from charging on all the Church.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Sufficient to ſuch a man is this puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which was inflicted of many.</p>
               <p rend="small">6. The Churches Cenſure and Rejection of ſuch a Sinner, is as much Puniſhment as I judged meet.</p>
               <p rend="small">
                  <hi>Note,</hi> That the Puniſhment was not only in the preſence of Many, (that is, the Aſſembly) but alſo [<hi>by many</hi>:] For though the Paſtor had the Keys, the People were conſenting Executioners, by avoiding Communion with the Excommunicate.</p>
               <p n="7">7. So that contrariwiſe, ye ought rather to forgive him, and comfort him, leſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſuch a one ſhould be ſwallowed up with overmuch ſorrow.</p>
               <p rend="small">7. But now he is penitent, ye ought to forgive, and comfort him with the notice of Pardoning Mercy from God, leſt too much ſorrow overwhelm him.</p>
               <p rend="small">
                  <hi>Note,</hi> That Sorrow for Sin may be too much; and it is ſo, when it ſwalloweth us up, and doth more hurt than good.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Wherefore I beſeech you that ye would confirm your love towards him.</p>
               <p rend="small">8. I that judged him for his Sin, now abſolve him, and intreat you in Love to receive him.</p>
               <p n="9">9 For to this end alſo did I write, that I might know the proof of you, whether ye be obedient in all things.</p>
               <p rend="small">9. I wrote to you to caſt him out, to exerciſe your Obedience: and ſo I now do to take him in.</p>
               <p n="10">10. To whom ye forgive any thing, I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give alſo: for if I forgave any thing, to whom I forgave it, for your ſakes forgave I it, in the perſon of Chriſt;</p>

               <p rend="small">11. For we know that Satan hath his Stratagems, and would turn our Juſtice and Diſcipline to our hurt, (either by too much dejecting the Sinner, or
<pb facs="tcp:66325:191"/>
by exaſperating and dividing the Church:) And we would not be over-reached by him: The Means are for the End.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Furthermore, when I came to Troas to preach Chriſts goſpel, and a door was opened unto me of the Lord, 13. I had no reſt in my ſpirit, becauſe I found not Titus my brother: but taking my leave of them, I went from thence into Macedonia.</p>
               <p rend="small">12, 13. At <hi>Troas</hi> I had great Encouragement in my Miniſtry; but not hearing of you by <hi>Titus,</hi> diſquieted me, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="14">14. Now thanks be unto God, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways cauſeth us to triumph in Chriſt, and maketh manifeſt the ſavour of his knowledge by us in every place.</p>
               <p rend="small">14. To God I give Thanks, who cauſeth me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice in the Succeſs of my Miniſtry for Chriſt; and whereever I come communicateth to Men the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his Goſpel.</p>
               <p n="15">15. For we are unto God a ſweet ſavour of Chriſt, in them that are ſaved, and in them that periſh. 16. To the one we are the ſavour of death unto death; and to the other the ſavour of life unto life:</p>
               <p rend="small">15, 16. For our Service to God is an acceptable Sacrifice, for the ſake of Chriſt, both about them that are ſaved, and them that periſh; to them that abuſe and reject the Goſpel to their own deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on, and them that are converted and ſaved by it: For God will be glorified in both, and accepteth our Miniſtry to both, notwithſtanding the various Succeſs.</p>
               <p n="16">16, 17. And who is ſufficient for theſe things? For we are not as many, which corrupt the word of God: but as of ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, but as of God, in the ſight of God ſpeak we in Chriſt.</p>
               <p rend="small">16, 17. So great is this Work, that neither I nor any is ſufficient for it, in our own Strength, without Gods ſuitable Help and Grace. But I have the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of my Sincerity, that I do not as do the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupters of the Word of God; but I ſpeak the things of Chriſt in truth, as God inſpired me, and as in his ſight.</p>

               <p n="1">1. DO we begin again to commend our ſelves? or need we, as ſome <hi>others,</hi> epiſtles of commendation to you, or letters of commendation from you?</p>
               <p rend="small">1. And ſeeing the Reputation of our Perſons is ſo needful to the Ends of our Miniſtry, let me expoſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late with you, why you ſhould hearken to them who make it needful to vindicate our ſelves? Am I a Stranger to you? Do I need, as ſome others, to be recommended to you by other Mens Letters? Or by your Letters to be recommended to other Churches? Do I not bring with me the Proof of mine Apoſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Ye are our epiſtle written in our hearts, known and read of all men:</p>
               <p rend="small">2. Your own Converſion by my Miniſtry, which is the rejoicing of my Heart, is more than a Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datory Epiſtle; and this may be read of all that know you.</p>
               <p n="3">3. For as much as ye are manifeſtly decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be the epiſtle of Chriſt, miniſtred by us, written not with ink, but with the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the living God; not in tables of ſtone, but in fleſhly tables of the heart.</p>
               <p rend="small">3. For your Converſion openly proveth, that you are as it were Chriſts own Epiſtle by our Miniſtry, written by the quickning Spirit of the Living God, and not with Ink; not as <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law, on Tables of Stone; but on your very Hearts; And therefore, as you are the Epiſtle or Teſtimony of the Work of Chriſt, ſo of me, as his Miniſter.</p>
               <p n="4">4, 5. And ſuch truſt have we through Chriſt to God-ward: Not that we are ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient of our ſelves to think any thing as of our ſelves: but our ſufficiency is of God.</p>
               <p rend="small">4, 5. It is of God that I have this Confidence and Glorying: Far be it from me to think that I have any ſuch Sufficiency of my ſelf, to convert Souls; but my Sufficiency and the Succeſs is all of God.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Who alſo hath made us able miniſters of the new teſtament, not of the letter, but of the ſpirit: for the letter killeth, but the ſpirit giveth life.</p>
               <p rend="small">6. It is he that hath made me an able Miniſter of the New Covenant; not a Preacher of the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> written in Stone, but of the Goſpel of Chriſt, who ſendeth us forth by his Spirit, and giveth his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit by our Miniſtry: For the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> curſeth Sinners, and ſheweth them Sin, and condemneth them: But the Spirit of Chriſt doth quicken them, and kill their Sin, and lead them in the way of Life.</p>
               <p n="7">7. But if the miniſtration of death writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and ingraven in ſtones, was glorious, ſo that the children of Iſrael could not ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly behold the face of Moſes, for the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his countenance, which glory was to be done away.</p>
               <p rend="small">7. For if that Miniſtry of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence was of Death, (or of a Law that condemned, but gave not the Spirit of Life) written and engraven by God in Stones, was accompanied with ſo great Glory, that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> could not endure to look

                  <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Face, for the Glory of his Countenance, which yet is now done away;</p>
               <p n="8">8. How ſhall not the miniſtration of the ſpirit be rather glorious.</p>
               <p rend="small">8. Muſt not the more excellent Miniſtry of a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Goſpel, by which God giveth Men his Spirit, be more glorious? (though we the Miniſters ſeem con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible.)</p>
               <p n="9">9. For if the miniſtration of condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be glory, much more doth the miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of righteouſneſs exceed in glory.</p>
               <p rend="small">9. The different Covenants ſhew the different Glory of the Miniſtry: For if <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Miniſtration of a condemning Law was Glory, our Miniſtration of a juſtifying, ſaving, Goſpel-Covenant muſt needs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed his Miniſtry in true Glory.</p>
               <p n="10">10. For even that which was made glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, had no glory in this reſpect, by reaſon of the glory that excelleth.</p>
               <p rend="small">10. For as a greater Light maketh a leſſer ſeem as none, ſo the <hi>Moſaick</hi> Miniſtry of the Law had as it were no Glory, being, clouded by the Glory of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p n="11">11. For if that which is done away was glorious, much more that which remaineth is glorious.</p>
               <p rend="small">11. For if the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> (conſidered formally as ſuch, and given to the <hi>Jews</hi> to rule their Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, and lead them to Chriſt) which was to ceaſe when the Goſpel came, to which it was a School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter, was yet given in Glory; much more is the Goſpel, which is to continue, and its Miniſtration, glorious.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Seeing then that we have ſuch hope, we uſe great plainneſs of ſpeech.</p>
               <p rend="small">12. Wonder not then that we ſpeak boldly to you, when we can ſhew ſuch Authority.</p>
               <p n="13">13. And not as Moſes, which put a vail over his face, that the children of Iſrael could not ſtedfaſtly look to the end of that which is aboliſhed.</p>
               <p rend="small">13. We do not as <hi>Moſes</hi> veil our Faces, ſignifying that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> could not well look to the true End and Meaning of their own Law, which is Chriſt, to whom by Types it pointed them; nor ſee that it was to be aboliſhed by his better Covenant, as it now is.

                  <p>THe fear of favouring <hi>Antinomianiſm</hi> hath tempted ſome to pervert this Chapter, about the aboliſhing of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law. I know of no Man that hath written ſo much againſt the <hi>Antinomians</hi> as I have done, nor with ſo much ſucceſs, in caſting down their Libertine Errours in this Land: And yet I abhor running into the contrary Extreme. And therefore I ſay, that it is evident to any unprejudiced conſidering Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that <hi>Paul</hi> here affirmeth, That the very Law written in Stone is aboliſhed and done away, To ſay, It is only the Glory of the Burning Mount, or of <hi>Moſes</hi> Face, that is done away, is plainly contrary to Ver. 7, 9, 10, 11, 13. I will not tire the Reader with Arguments from ſo plain Words. The Truth is this:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Law of Nature is not done away by Chriſt, but made part of his own Law, into whoſe Hands that and all things are given.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Ten Commandments, except the Preface, and a Word or two in the Second Commandment, and the Determination of the Seventh Day in the Fourth Commandment, are the Common Law of Nature.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb facs="tcp:66325:192"/>3. Chriſt alſo hath expreſly made them his Law, by reciting them preceptively: And ſo they bind all Chriſtians now, as the Law of Nature, and the Law of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. God by giving the <hi>Jews</hi> their Laws, gave us Directions to know in the like Caſes what is equal or wrong to us.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. But formally, as it was Gods Law delivered by <hi>Moſes</hi> to the <hi>Jews,</hi> it binds not us, and it's done away.</p>
                  <p>For, 1. It never, as ſuch, bound any but the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the few Proſelytes among them. For it was never promulgated to the World: And even the Decalogue was Political, and all made for that Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. And all the World was never bound to turn <hi>Jews,</hi> nor to dwell or come into a remote Country, no bigger than half <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The <hi>Jews</hi> own Commonwealth is diſſolved, and ſo are their peculiar Laws.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Apoſtle expreſly ſaith, That the Law written in Stone, that was glorious, is done away, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. &amp; 11.13. compared.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Moſes</hi> was no Ruler or Mediator to the whole World.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. If one part of <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, as ſuch, bind, then all of it bindeth, <hi>a quatenus ad omne</hi>; and ſo we muſt turn <hi>Jews.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>Paul</hi> expreſly nameth Sabbaths as aboliſhed; that is, A Day of Ceremonial Reſt, which the Fourth Commandment ordaineth as a Type of Spiritual Reſt by Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>The Sum is, That we are bound to the Law commonly called Moral, as it is the Law of Nature, and of Chriſt; but not formally, as the Law given the <hi>Jews</hi> by <hi>Moſes,</hi> or as written in Stone.</p>

               <p rend="small">3. So that if our Preaching be not yet underſtood and believed, it is not for want of our clear Delivery, but from the miſerable Caſe of loſt uncapable Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</p>

               <p rend="small">4. Becauſe the Devil, by the love of worldly things, ruling the Hearts of worldly Men, hath blinded them, that they may not believe the Goſpel, and ſee that Glory which ſhineth in Chriſt, who is the Image of God.</p>
               <p n="5">5. For we preach not our ſelves, but Chriſt Jeſus the Lord; and our ſelves your ſervants for Jeſus ſake.</p>

It is not our ſelves that we commend by preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to you, or ſet up for you to believe in; but it is Chriſt Jeſus the Lord, (elſe indeed our Miniſtry were inglorious:) and we only manifeſt our ſelves to be faithful Servants for your Salvation by Chriſt, who hath called us hereto, and whoſe Glory we proclaim.</p>
               <p n="6">6. For God who commanded the light to ſhine out of darkneſs, hath ſhined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God, in the face of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p rend="small">6. For God, who by his Word created Light, hath ſhined by Spiritual Light into our Hearts, giving us that Knowledge of God which gloriouſly appeareth in the Perſon, Doctrine, and Works of Chriſt, which he commandeth us to communicate to others.</p>
               <p n="7">7. But we have this treaſure in earthen veſſels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us.</p>

For all our Sufferings for Chriſt, and Bodily Afflictions, are very tollerable and light, and ſo ſhort as to be but as for one moment; and ſo gainful, that they are the Means appointed to procure us a Crown of Glory, which is weighty, and of exceeding Worth, and Everlaſting.</p>
               <p n="18">18. While we look not at the things which are ſeen, but at the things which are not ſeen: for the things which are ſeen, are temporal; but the things which are not ſeen, are eternal.</p>
               <p rend="small">18. For we intend no worldly End, nor fix our Eyes and Mind on theſe tranſitory things, which now are here ſeen; but on the Glory and Kingdom which is unſeen: For the things which are ſeen are tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary, mutable, and fly away, and therefore are not to be much regarded; but the things which are now to us unſeen, are unchangeable and everlaſting.</p>

               <p rend="small">2, 3. For in this Body we are under a conſtant uneaſineſs, which maketh us groan with earneſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be better cloathed, even with the Incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Celeſtial Glory: For when Death unclotheth us, we ſhall not be found naked and deſtitute, (or, as ſome expound it, [So be it we be not found, as <hi>Adam,</hi> naked in our Guilt, when we enter into the future State.])</p>
               <p n="4">4. For we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might be ſwallowed up of life.</p>
               <p rend="small">4. For our Burdens in this Body are ſo great, as
<pb facs="tcp:66325:193"/>
make us groan: not that we deſire Death, as Death; or to be unhouſed, or without Cloathing to the Soul: but we would be better clothed with a Heavenly Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that that which is Mortal may be ſwallowed up by Immortal Glory.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Now he that hath wrought us for the ſelf-ſame thing, is God, who alſo hath given unto us the earneſt of the Spirit.</p>
               <p rend="small">5. And we have good Evidence for the certainty of this Hope: For God himſelf, who doth nothing in vain, hath made and formed us hereunto: It is he that gave us Immortal Souls, and Faculties to prepare for a better Life: And it is he that hath redeemed us to it, and hath promiſed it, and provided and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded us the Means that lead to it, and hath given us by his Spirit thoſe holy Affections, Deſires, and Endeavours which are the Earneſt of it, and which he will not fruſtrate.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Therefore we are always confident, knowing that whilſt we are at home in the body, we are abſent from the Lord: 7. (For we walk by faith, not by ſight.)</p>
               <p rend="small">6, 7. Therefore we go on in the Confidence and Boldneſs which beſeem Believers, being above the Fear of Death; knowing, that while we dwell here in theſe Bodies, we are abſent from the Glory where God is fully manifeſted to the Bleſſed: For it is not things ſeen which are the Motives, Hopes, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of our Lives; but it's things believed and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen.</p>
               <p n="8">8. We are confident, <hi>I ſay,</hi> and willing rather to be abſent from the body, and to be preſent with the Lord.</p>
               <p rend="small">8. I ſay, we are bold and comfortably confident in all our Labours and danger of Death, and rather willing to go from the Body, and to be at home or preſent with the Lord.</p>

               <p n="10">10. For we muſt all appear before the judgment-ſeat of Chriſt, that every one may receive the things done in his body, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.</p>

               <p n="12">12. For we commend not our ſelves again unto you, but give you occaſion to glory on our behalf, that you may have ſomewhat to anſwer them which glory in appearance, and not in heart.</p>
               <p rend="small">12. I ſay not all this to get your Praiſe by my ſelf-commendation, but to give you the Matter of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to them that would draw you from the Truth, by drawing you into a diſeſteem of us that were your firſt Teachers, and by boaſting of themſelves by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward appearances, without an anſwerable inward Worth.</p>
               <p n="13">13. For whether we be beſides our ſelves, it is to God: or whether we be ſober, it is for your cauſe.</p>
               <p rend="small">13.

And if we be thought to do it ſoberly, it is not for our Glory, but for your Stability and Safety.</p>
               <p n="14">14. For the love of Chriſt conſtraineth us, becauſe we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead: 15. And that he died for all, that they which live, ſhould not henceforth live unto themſelves, but unto him which died for them, and roſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
               <p rend="small">14, 15. If any think we are too zealouſly tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, let them know, that the greatneſs of Chriſts Love to us, and ours to him, conſtraineth us, and will bear no cold Indifferency: For we have cauſe to judge, that they are great things which our Redemption in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timateth, even that Chriſt, who died for all, found all Men dead in Sin and Miſery; and that he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore redeemed them by his Death, that they who are recovered by him ſhould not hereafter live to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but to him that died for them, and roſe again.</p>
               <p n="16">16. Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the fleſh: yea, though we have known Chriſt after the fleſh, yet now hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth know we him no more.</p>
               <p rend="small">16. Wherefore it is the great things of Spirituality and Eternity which we now look at in our Miniſtry and Life: We value no Man on meer Carnal Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages

or Account; yea, if we had been of thoſe that converſt with Chriſt on Earth in the Body, and had eat and drunk in his preſence, ſuch Corporal Familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is ended, and is not it that our Faith, and Hope, and Preaching moſt reſpecteth; but his Spiritual Kingdom, and Glorious Preſence, and the Means thereto.</p>
               <p n="17">17. Therefore if any man be in Chriſt, he is a new creature: old things are paſt away, behold, all things are become new.</p>

Of this you have now experience in your ſelves; for your godly Sorrow for the Scandals that roſe among you, hath wrought great carefulneſs to ſearch out the Caſe, and to reform it; great care to clear your ſelves from partaking in the guilt, great indignation againſt the Sin; great fear of God, leſt he ſhould avenge it; great deſire after a Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; great Zeal againſt any Church-pollution in the things of God; yea, and juſt Revenge on the Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders by way of Penitence, and on your ſelves for any degree of guilt: ſo that you have by all means ſhewed, that you are clear from the guilt.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Wherefore though I wrote unto you, I did it not for his cauſe that had done the wrong, nor for his cauſe that ſuffered wrong, but that our care for you in the ſight of God might appear unto you.</p>
               <p rend="small">12. And my ſharp writing to you was not meerly to right one Man againſt the Injuries of another, as an Act of Juſtice between Man and Man; but it was in love to you, and care of your Souls, that you might not be found guilty before God.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Therefore we were comforted in your comfort: yea, and exceedingly the more joyed we for the joy of Titus, becauſe his ſpirit was refreſhed by you all.</p>
               <p rend="small">13. Therefore in theſe fruits which tend to your own comfort, I alſo an comforted; to which much is added by the Comfort that <hi>Titus</hi> had amomg you.</p>
               <p n="14">14. For it I have boaſted any thing to him

               <p n="15">15. And his inward affection is more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant toward you, whilſt he remembreth the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling you received him.</p>
               <p rend="small">15. And he is greatly affected towards you, by finding you ſo obedient, and how you received him and his Meſſage with a careful fear of Gods diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and the guilt of Sin.</p>
               <p n="16">16. I rejoyce therefore that I have confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in you in all things.</p>
               <p rend="small">16. My expectation therefore of your Obedience, diſperſing my fear of you, and increaſing my confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of your ſtability, doth increaſe my Joy.</p>

               <p n="1">1. MOreover brethren, we do you to wit, of the grace of God beſtowed on the churches of Macedonia:</p>
               <p rend="small">1. And I think it meet here to give you notice of the Grace of God on the Churches of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> which appeared in their willing Liberality in our Collections for <hi>Judea.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. How that in a great trial of affliction, the abundance of their joy, and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality.</p>
               <p rend="small">2. How that while they were themſelves under a great Trial of Affliction, and in deep Poverty, yet they joyfully abounded in Liberality.</p>
               <p n="3">3. For to their power (I bear record) yea, and beyond their power, they were willing of themſelves.</p>
               <p rend="small">3. For they were voluntarily ready, even beyond their Power; which they extended to the utmoſt.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Praying us with much intreaty, that we would receive the gift, and take upon us the fellowſhip of the miniſtring to the ſaints.</p>
               <p rend="small">4. Earneſtly entreating us to receive their Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution, and undertake the adminiſtring of it to the Saints at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as an Expreſſion of their Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating Love.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And this they did, not as we hoped, but firſt gave their own ſelves to the Lord, and unto us by the will of God.</p>
               <p rend="small">5. And in this they exceeded our hope, firſt giving themſelves to God, and to us as his Miniſters, as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to help us with their Perſons, as well as with their Purſes.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Inſomuch that we deſired Titus, that as he had begun, ſo he would alſo finiſh in you the ſame grace alſo.</p>
               <p rend="small">6. And ſo we deſired <hi>Titus,</hi> that as he had begun the motion or this Charity to you, he would be at the labour to travel to you, and bring it to perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Therefore as ye abound in every thing, in faith, in utterance, and knowledge, and in all dilligence, and in your love to us; ſee that ye abound in this grace alſo.</p>
               <p rend="small">7. Therefore as you are a Church eminent for Gifts of Faith, Knowledge, Speech, Diligence, and Love to us, ſee that your charitable Contribution abound in anſwerableneſs to your Gifts.</p>
               <p n="8">8. I ſpeak not by commandment, but by occaſion of the forwardneſs of others, and to prove the ſincerity of your love.</p>
               <p rend="small">8. I do not this as the Maſter of your Purſes, by way of command; but I ſet before you the good Example of others, and I invite you to give this proof of the ſincerity of your Love to me, and to the Brethren: (For Hypocrites will afford us a cheap ſor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of Love, but not a coſtly one.)</p>
               <p n="9">9. For ye know the grace of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, that though he was rich, yet for your ſakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich.</p>
               <p rend="small">9. And what can be a ſtronger Motive to you, than the Example of Chriſt, who, though he was Lord of all the World, for our ſakes lived in the Body, in the Condition of the Poor; and this was to procure us the Heavenly Riches: So that you relieve him reputatively, in relieving his Members; and you imitate him, when you forſake your own Abundance for the good of others.</p>
               <p n="10">10. And herein I give my advice: for this is expedient for you, who have begun before, not onely to do, but alſo to be forward a year ago.</p>
               <p rend="small">10. And I am the bolder herein to adviſe you, becauſe you your ſelves have herein begun, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to go on, a year ago; and therefore it is but agreeable to your own Reſolves.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Now therefore perform the doing of it; that as there was a readineſs to will, ſo there may be a performance alſo out of that which you have.</p>
               <p rend="small">11. Therefore now perform what then you readily reſolved on, according to your ability.</p>
               <p n="12">12. For if there be firſt a willing mind, it is accepted according to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not.</p>
               <p rend="small">
                  <pb facs="tcp:66325:196"/>12. For if there be a true willingneſs, it will be performed according to a Mans ability; and God requireth no more, but accepteth the Will for that which we are unable for.</p>
               <p n="13">13. For I mean not that other men be eaſed, and you burdened: 14. But by an equality, that now at this time your abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance may be a ſupply for their want, that their abundance alſo may be a ſupply for your want, that there may be equality.</p>
               <p rend="small">13, 14. Not that I would lay more on you than your Proportion, to eaſe others: but that now you abound, you may ſupply their want; and that when you are in want, the abundance of others may ſupply your wants.</p>
               <p n="15">15. As it is written, He that had gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed much had nothing over: and he that had gathered little, had no lack.</p>
               <p rend="small">15. In which I may allude to what is ſaid of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> gathering Manna; [<hi>He that, &amp;c.</hi>] Obey God, and you ſhall not want; and if you abound, what enjoy you of it more than they that have but Food and Raiment? God will reduce all his Servants to an Equality ſuitable to them ſeverally, in the Uſe and End.</p>
               <p n="16">16. But thanks be to God, which put the ſame earneſt care into the heart of Titus for you. 17. For indeed he accepted the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, but being more forward, of his own accord he went unto you.</p>
               <p rend="small">16, 17. I thank God that <hi>Titus</hi> was as forward to move you to this Work as I; for he did not only yield to it at my requeſt, but of his own accord was forward to go to you about it.</p>
               <p n="18">18. And we have ſent with him the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whoſe praiſe is in the goſpel, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all the churches:</p>
               <p rend="small">28. And with him we ſent <hi>Luke,</hi> whoſe Service for the Goſpel hath made him honoured in all the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</p>
               <p n="19">19. (And not that onely, but who was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo choſen of the churches, to travel with us with this grace which is adminiſtred by us to the glory of the ſame Lord, and declaration of your ready mind)</p>
               <p rend="small">19. And who was choſen by the Churches to go with us in this Miniſtration of your Charity to the <hi>Jews,</hi> that God may have the Glory of this notified Concord of <hi>Jewiſh</hi> and Gentile Chriſtians, and of your ready Minds to ſo good a Work.</p>
               <p n="20">20. Avoiding this, that no man ſhould blame us in this abundance, which is admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred by us: 21. Providing for honeſt things, not onely in the ſight of the Lord, but alſo in the ſight of men.</p>
               <p rend="small">20, 21. For I took care to avoid all occaſion of ſuſpicion, that I ſhould detain any of this large Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribution to my ſelf, or unfaithfully diſtribute it: Providing that all be done decently and blameleſly in the ſight of Men, as well as faithfully in the ſight of God.</p>
               <p n="22">22. And we have ſent with them our bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whom we have oftentimes proved di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent in many things, but now much more diligent, upon the great confidence which I have in you.</p>
               <p rend="small">22. And with them I have ſent another Brother, whoſe Diligence I have oft tried, but now find him much more willing; being encouraged by my confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of your forwardneſs.</p>
               <p n="23">23. Whether any do enquire of Titus, he is my partner, and fellow-helper concerning you: or our brethren be enquired of, they are the meſſengers of the churches, and the glory of Chriſt.</p>
               <p rend="small">23. If any doubting of their Truſtineſs, enquire what theſe Brethren are, let them know, that <hi>Titus</hi> is my Partner and Helper even for your Service; and the other two Brethren are Meſſengers of the Churches (who would not truſt untruſty Men) and an Honour to the Chriſtian Faith.</p>
               <p n="24">24. Wherefore ſhew ye to them, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the churches, the proof of your love, and of our boaſting on your behalf.</p>
               <p rend="small">24. So far therefore regard them, as to let them ſee, and the Churches that ſent them, hear the Proof of your Love to me, and to all Saints, by your Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, and that I have not boaſted of you in vain.</p>
               <p rend="small">
                  <hi>Note,</hi> 1. That <hi>Paul</hi>'s Importunity for this Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ſheweth that the Caſe was much altered, ſince in <hi>Acts</hi> 4. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they ſold all and laid at the Apoſtles Feet, and had all things common. And as Men were quickly grown more cold, ſo that was not intended for a conſtant and univerſal Practice, but to ſhew with the Gift of Tongues, the marvellous degree of holy Love and Unity which the Holy Ghoſt was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to effect: For to continue it every where, would have diſabled them all to do much future good with Riches, when all was gone. And perhaps the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> were then in greater want by that.</p>
               <p rend="small">2. We ſee, that even among Chriſtians coſtly Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties come hardly off (elſe <hi>Paul</hi> had not needed all this ado) even where Gifts and Parts are eminent.</p>
               <p rend="small">3. And yet it is coſtly Duties of Charity that muſt prove the truth of our Faith and Love, which are dead if barren.</p>
               <p rend="small">4. We ſee, that a Miniſter who ſeeth cauſe obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately to avoid being chargeable to any of his Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers himſelf, leſt they contemn or ſuſpect him as a Self-ſeeker, may yet put on confidence, and be bold and importunate in urging them to Charity for others, and Collections for the Service of the Church and Goſpel.</p>

               <p n="1">1. FOr as touching the miniſtring to the ſaints, it is ſuperfluous for me to write to you. 2. For I know the forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of your mind, for which I boaſt of you to them of Macedonia, that Achaia was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy a year ago; and your zeal hath provoked very many.</p>
               <p rend="small">1, 2. But to uſe many Arguments with you, for the Duty of relieving the needy Saints in general, or for this Contribution in particular, I ſuppoſe it need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, you being your ſelves ſo forward to it, that I have boaſted of your readineſs a year ago, which hath quickned the Zeal of many others.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Yet have I ſent the brethren, leſt our boaſting of you ſhould be in vain in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half; that, as I ſaid, ye may be ready:</p>
               <p rend="small">3. Yet to make ſure, I have ſent the Brethren, leſt it be to do when I come, and my boaſting of you fail.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Leſt haply if they of Macedonia come with me, and find you unprepared, we (that we ſay not, you) ſhould be aſhamed in this ſame confident boaſting.</p>
               <p rend="small">4. For I would not have them of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> if they come with me, by finding your Collection unready, think that you are unwilling, to your diſhonour, and mine, that boaſted of you.</p>
               <p rend="small">
                  <hi>Note,</hi> That it's lawful to uſe an honeſt Craft to draw Men to their Duty, 1. By engaging their Reputation in it: 2. And by alluring them by juſt Praiſe.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Therefore I thought it neceſſary to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort the brethren, that they would go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore unto you, and make up beforehand your bounty, whereof ye had notice before, that the ſame might be ready as a matter of bounty, and not as of covetouſneſs.</p>
               <p rend="small">5. Therefore I ſent theſe three Brethren, to deſire you that it might be ready, (you having notice of it alſo heretofore) that it may appear to be of willing Liberality, and not extorted from covetous Men.</p>
               <p n="6">6. But this I ſay, He which ſoweth ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly, ſhall reap alſo ſparingly: and he which ſoweth bountifully, ſhall reap alſo bountifully.</p>
               <p rend="small">6. As to the Proportion, I will ſay but this; All ſhall reap in that meaſure that they ſowe.</p>
               <p rend="small">
                  <hi>Note,</hi> That <hi>Paul</hi>'s diſclaiming Juſtification by Works, conſiſteth with this Doctrine, That all Men ſhall be rewarded not only according to the Sincerity of their Hearts, but alſo according to the Degrees of their obedient Will and Works.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Every man according as he purpoſeth in his heart, ſo let him give; not grudgingly, or of neceſſity: for God loveth a chearful giver.</p>
               <p rend="small">7. Let your Will command you in the proportion: Do it not grudgingly, and as urged and conſtrained againſt your Wills; but as you are truly willing: For God loveth a chearful Giver, and not the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Deed only, which is againſt or without the W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="8">8. And God is able to make all grace a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound towards you; that ye always having all ſufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work:</p>

               <p rend="small">1. I know that boaſting is unſeemly for an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Miniſter of Chriſt: but ſeeing it is put upon me, I proceed to a higher Matter, even Viſions and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations from God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I knew a man in Chriſt above fourteen years ago (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth) ſuch an one caught up to the third heaven. 3. And I knew ſuch a man (whether in the body, or out of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, I cannot tell: God knoweth) 4. How that he was caught up into paradiſe, and heard unſpeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.</p>
               <p rend="small">2, 3, 4. I knew a Man that was acted by the Spirit of Chriſt above himſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who above fourteen years ago (whether Bodily, or onely by mental Extaſie and Rapture, I know not, God knoweth) was caught up to that Place of Glory called the Third Heavens, and caught up there into Paradiſe, a Place of Joys, and heard that which neither can nor muſt be uttered, being unſuitable to the Ears of Mortals, and proper to Poſſeſſors.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Of ſuch an one will I glory: yet of my ſelf I will not glory, but in mine infirmities.</p>
               <p rend="small">5. I think this Fore-taſte of the Heavenly Glory, worthy to be gloried in: But (though I be the Man) I will not glory in it as my own, who was but paſſive, and advanced to it by God, to whom all the Glory is due. It is my Infirmities, or debaſing Sufferings in the World, which I will call my own, and boaſt of.</p>
               <p n="6">6. For though I would deſire to glory, I ſhall not be a fool; for I will ſay the truth: but now I forbear, leſt any man ſhould think of me above that which he ſeeth me to be, or that he heareth of me.</p>
               <p rend="small">6. Should I boaſt of this ſo great a G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ft, to the Glory of the Giver, it would be no Folly: But I lay it by, expecting that no Man judge highlier of me, than by what himſelf ſhall ſee or hear.</p>
               <p n="7">7. And leſt I ſhould be exalted above meaſure through the abundance of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations, there was given to me a thorn in in the fleſh, the meſſenger of Satan to buſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fet me, leſt I ſhould be exalted above mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
               <p rend="small">7. And leſt this Revelation ſhould too much lift me up, there was given me a Thorn in the Fleſh, a Meſſenger of Satan to put me to pain, and keep me from too much Exaltation.</p>
               <p rend="small">
                  <hi>Note,</hi> 1. It is moſt unlikely which ſome feign to be the ſenſe of theſe Words, <hi>viz.</hi> That it was a Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Luſt: It's moſt like it was ſuch a Pain as the Stone, or at leaſt ſome bitter Perſecution.</p>
               <p rend="small">2. Even the holieſt Chriſtians, after their moſt heavenly Acquaintance, are not out of danger of Pride, or being too much exalted.</p>
               <p rend="small">3. This Spiritual Pride is ſo dangerous a Sin, that it's a Mercy to be ſaved from it, even by Bodily Pain.</p>
               <p rend="small">4. God will hurt the Bodies, to ſave the Souls, even of his deareſt Children.</p>
               <p rend="small">5. Satan, that intendeth hurt, is oft Gods Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to do us good.</p>
               <p rend="small">6. Bodily Pains are oft the Meſſengers of Satan, and yet of God.</p>
               <p n="8">8. For this thing I beſought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me.</p>
               <p rend="small">8. <hi>Note,</hi> 1. That it is lawful to pray for the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of Pain; 2. Yea, to be oft in prayer for it.</p>
               <p n="9">9. And he ſaid unto me, My grace is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for thee: for my ſtrength is made perfect in weakneſs.</p>
               <p rend="small">9. And the Anſwer which I had was not a preſent removal of the Thorn, but a Word for Patience and Truſt in God, <hi>viz.</hi> That his Favour and Grace was ſufficient for me, to ſupport and comfort me till de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance came; and that it is his way in our Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to manifeſt moſt his helping Power.</p>
               <p n="9">9, 10. Moſt gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Chriſt may reſt upon me. Therefore I take pleaſure in infirmities, in reproches, in ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities, in perſecutions, in diſtreſſes for Chriſts ſake: for when I am weak, then am I ſtrong.</p>
               <p rend="small">9, 10. It is therefore in Sufferings that I will glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as being the occaſion of my greater Experience of the Lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e and Power of Chriſt: Yea, I even take pleaſure in abaſing Sufferings for him, though not as painful, yet as an advantage to his Grace that ſtrengthneth me, ſo far am I from being aſhamed or impatient of them.</p>
               <p n="11">11. I am become a fool in glorying, ye have compelled me: for I ought to have been commended of you: for in nothing am
<pb facs="tcp:66325:199"/>
I behind the very chiefeſt apoſtles, though I be nothing.</p>
               <p rend="small">11. I have ſaid all this as in the Habit of a Fool: but it's you that put it on me, by neceſſity, who ſhould have vindicated me and my Miniſtry againſt ſeducing Accuſers.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Truly the ſigns of an apoſtle were wrought among you in all patience, in ſigns, and wonders, and mighty deeds.</p>
               <p rend="small">12. Are not you my Witneſſes? I appeal to your ſelves: Among you my Apoſtleſhip was fully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, by patient Suffering, and by miraculous Gifts, and Signs, and Wonders, and Works, done by the Power of God.</p>
               <p n="13">13. For what is it wherein ye were infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to other churches, except it be that I my ſelf was not burdenſom to you? forgive me this wrong.</p>
               <p rend="small">13. For what Gifts of the Spirit poured out among you? what Signs and Miracles have other Churches excelled you in? The difference between you and others was, that I ſpared your Purſes, and put you to no charge: If that be a wrong, I hope you can eaſily forgive it.</p>
               <p n="14">14. Behold, the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not be burdenſom to you; for I ſeek not yours, but you: for the children ought not to lay up for the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, but the parents for the children.</p>
               <p rend="small">14. A third time I purpoſe to come to you, and not to burden you, but as to my children, to give, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than to receive.</p>
               <p n="15">15. And I will very gladly ſpend and be ſpent for you, though the more abundantly I love you, the leſs I be loved.</p>
               <p rend="small">15. And I will gladly ſpend my Time and Labour, and be ſpent my ſelf, even as to my Strength and Life, for your Salvation, though my Love ſhould be requited with Neglect.</p>
               <p n="16">16. But be it ſo, I did not burden you: nevertheleſs being crafty, I caught you with guile. 17. Did I make a gain of you by any of them whom I ſent unto you?</p>
               <p rend="small">16, 17. But be it as ſome object, that though I took no Money of you, I craftily caught you with guile, that getting your Affections, I might hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter make advantage of you for my ſelf: But my Craft was but to win you to Chriſt. Did I make a gain of you, by any of them whom I ſent unto you? Will you judge of my Deſign contrary to my Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice?</p>
               <p n="18">18. I deſired Titus, and with him I ſent a brother: did Titus make a gain of you? walked we not in the ſame ſpirit? walked we not in the ſame ſteps?</p>
               <p rend="small">18. Did <hi>Titus,</hi> or the Brother whom I ſent to you, make a Gain of you? Did we not all agree in Mind and Practice?</p>
               <p n="19">19. Again, think you that we excuſe our ſelves unto you? we ſpeak before God in Chriſt: but we do all things, dearly beloved, for your edifying.</p>
               <p rend="small">19. Think not that I ſay all this to inſinuate my ſelf into your eſteem for any by Ends of my own: I ſpeak it as before God in Chriſt; It is your Edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation that is my End in this and all things that I do concerning you.</p>
               <p n="20">20. For I fear, leſt when I come I ſhall not find you ſuch as I would, and that I ſhall be found unto you ſuch as ye would not: leſt there be debates, envyings, wraths, ſtrifes, back-bitings, whiſperings, ſwellings, tumults: 21. And leſt when I come again, my God will humble me among you, and that I ſhall bewail many which have ſinned already, and have not repented of the uncleanneſs, and fornication, and laſciviouſneſs which they have committed.</p>
               <p rend="small">20, 21. For I fear leſt when I come I ſhall find among you theſe Sins, which are the Characters of Factious Minds, Debates, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and leſt God will hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble me among you with grief for you, and mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over the Impenitent, that have been guilty of thoſe filthy Sins, which Deceivers and Idol-Feaſts have drawn them to; and left I be forced to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>welcom to ſuch Perſons.</p>
               <p rend="small">
                  <hi>Note,</hi> I. Though <hi>Paul</hi> ſeems to contradict himſelf in praiſing the <hi>Corinthians</hi> ſo largely in the beginning of this Epiſtle, and deſcribing them ſo ill in the end: yet, 1. It is not the ſame Perſons that he praiſeth and diſpraiſeth, though of the ſame Church. 2. We muſt praiſe all that is good in Men, when we reprove the evil.</p>
               <p rend="small">II. <hi>Note,</hi> That the very Characters of factious ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced Profeſſors, are the Sins here named, which therefore we ſhould ſpecially abhor: 1. Debates, 2. Envying Zeal, 3. Wraths, 4. Strifes, 5. Back-bitings, 6. Whiſperings, 7. Swellings againſt each other, 8. Tumults. Yet it is very notable, That notwithſtanding all theſe Corruptions, and Abuſes and filthy Scandals, <hi>Paul</hi> neither ſeparateth, nor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuadeth any to ſeparate; but leaveth that to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical, who uſed to ſeparate themſelves into diſtinct Bodies, for the promoting of their Opinions and Parties.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XIII.</head>
               <p n="1">1. THis is the third time I am coming to you: In the mouth of two or three witneſſes ſhall every word be eſtabliſhed.</p>
               <p rend="small">
                  <pb facs="tcp:66325:200"/>1. As the Teſtimony of two or three Witneſſes confirmeth queſtioned Truth, ſo my ſecond and third Admonition warneth you to prevent Severity.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I told you before, and foretel you as if I were preſent the ſecond time, and being abſent, now I write to them which hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have ſinned, and to all other, that if I come again I will not ſpare:</p>
               <p rend="small">2. Though I be abſent, my Writing may paſs for warning as if I were preſent, by which I foretel you, that if I come, I will not forbear to exerciſe on the Impenitent the Power given me by Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Since ye ſeek a proof of Chriſt ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in me, which to you-ward is not weak, but is mighty in you.</p>
               <p rend="small">3. And ſeeing you call for a Proof of Chriſts ſpeaking in me, you ſhall have this further Proof (the Corporal Puniſhment of the Impenitent by Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle or Satans Execution): Though ſure the Power of Chriſt atteſting my Miniſtry, hath been ſo fully manifeſted among you, that you ſhould have been thereby convinced.</p>
               <p n="4">4. For though he was crucified through weakneſs, yet he liveth by the power of God: for we alſo are weak in him, but we ſhall live with him by the power of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward you.</p>
               <p rend="small">4. For as Chriſt in the State of Humane Weaknſs was crucified, but by Divine Power was raiſed, and liveth; ſo, as we are conformed to him in Weakneſs and Suffering, we ſhall ſhew you that we partake of the Power of God in our Life and Miniſtry.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Examine your ſelves whether ye be in the faith; prove your own ſelves: know ye not your own ſelves, how that Jeſus Chriſt is in you, except ye be reprobates?</p>
               <p rend="small">5. If you queſtion my Miniſtry, do but examine your ſelves, whether you be Chriſtians or not: If you are, was it not by the convincing Power of Gods Atteſtation to my Miniſtry? and do you queſtion that which converted you? If not, you are yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Saviour, and in your Sins: And if you deny Chriſt in you, and his Power ſhewed among you, you may expect that he will deny you.</p>
               <p n="6">6. But I truſt that ye ſhall know that we are not reprobates.</p>
               <p rend="small">6. And I truſt that you ſhall be convinced that we have not forſaken Chriſt, nor ſhall be caſt off or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken by him.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Now I pray to God that ye do no evil; not that we ſhould appear approved, but that ye ſhould do that which is honeſt, though we be as reprobates.</p>
               <p rend="small">7. My Prayer is, That you may be ſaved from Sin and Seduction, not ſo much that you may think well of us, but that you may do that which is right, how ill ſoever you think of us.</p>
               <p n="8">8. For we can do nothing againſt the truth, but for the truth.</p>
               <p rend="small">8. For as we have no Authority or Commiſſion to do any thing againſt the Truth, but only for it; ſo we have no deſire to do otherwiſe.</p>
               <p n="9">9. For we are glad when we are weak, and ye are ſtrong: and this alſo we wiſh, even your perfection.</p>
               <p rend="small">9. For how much ſoever we be vilified or afflicted, it is our joy that you are ſtrong, and that it is better with you: yea, it is your Perfection that is our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Therefore I write theſe things being abſent, leſt being preſent I ſhould uſe ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, according to the power which the Lord hath given me to edification, and not to deſtruction.</p>
               <p rend="small">10. It is to prevent Severity when I am preſent, and the trouble that you and I ſhall have in Penalties on you, that I give you this Admonition by Letter: ſtill profeſſing, That Chriſt hath given me no Power of Tyranny, or againſt your own good, but only for your Edification. Should I claim any other, it's not of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Finally, brethren, farewel: Be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace ſhall be with you.</p>
               <p rend="small">11. My concluding Valediction is, Be compact to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in holy Union; Rejoyce in the Lord; Be of one mind in Faith and Love, though you cannot in leſſer things; Live in peace: and then he that would be known to us as the God of Love and Peace, will be among you.</p>
               <p n="12">12, 13, 14. Greet one another with an holy kiſs. All the ſaints ſalute you. The grace of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the love of God, and the communion of the holy Ghoſt, be with you all. Amen.</p>
               <p rend="small">12, 13, 14. Expreſs Chriſtian Love to one another. The Saints here ſalute you. The higheſt Bleſſing I can wiſh you is, The Grace of Chriſt, the Love of God, and Communication of, and Communion in the Holy Spirit. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                  <hi>Note,</hi> out of all this Epiſtle, That though proud tenderneſs of our Reputation be a Sin, yet it is a Duty to vindicate it when the Intereſt of the Goſpel and of Souls require it; which it did more with an Apoſtle, than an ordinary Miniſter.</p>

            <p>THE Scope of this Epiſtle is to reduce the <hi>Galatians,</hi> who began to be ſeduced by thoſe Judaizers that would have not only joyned <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law to Chriſtianity, but alſo would have put that Yoak on the Gentile-Chriſtians: And it's like ſome Hereticks joined with them.

               </p>
               <p n="6">6. I marvel that ye are ſo ſoon removed from him that called you into the grace of Chriſt, unto another goſpel:</p>
               <p rend="small">6. I marvel that you, who voluntarily received the Truth from me, are ſo ſoon turned from the Goſpel of the Grace of Chriſt, to another Doctrine contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to this Grace, as if it were the Goſpel.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Which is not another; but there be ſome that trouble you, and would pervert the goſpel of Chriſt.</p>
               <p rend="small">7. Which is far from being Chriſts Goſpel, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to my Preaching, as they pretend; but it is the Doctrine of Men that would trouble you, and would pervert the Goſpel of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="8">8. But though we, or an angel from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, preach any other goſpel unto you, then that which we have preached unto you, let him be accurſed. 9. As we ſaid before, ſo ſay I now again, If any man preach any other goſpel unto you then that ye have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, let him be accurſed.</p>
               <p rend="small">8, 9. But I pronounce and repeat it, If I, yea, or an Angel from Heaven, if any Man pretend to preach to you any other Goſpel than that which we have preached, or you received, let him be <hi>Anathema,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce him as an excommunicate accurſed Perſon.</p>
               <p rend="small">
                  <hi>Note,</hi> 1. That there is no other Goſpel to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, beſides that communicated to us by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and recorded in the Scripture. The Dream of a more perfect Goſpel of the Holy Ghoſt, is wicked.</p>
               <p rend="small">2. That this Goſpel hath fuller Evidence than if an Angel ſpake from Heaven, and is to be believed before and againſt ſuch an Angel.</p>
               <p rend="small">3. That it is the Peoples Duty to reject and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake any Teacher that would bring another Goſpel, or pervert this: Not as Church-Governours, but as Subjects of Chriſt, that muſt be loyal to him, and ſave themſelves.</p>
               <p n="10">10. For do I now perſwade men, or God? or do I ſeek to pleaſe men? for if I yet pleaſed men, I ſhould not be the ſervant of Chriſt.</p>
               <p rend="small">
                  <pb facs="tcp:66325:201"/>10. Do I now preach the Doctrine of Men, on Mans Authority, to pleaſe Men; or the Word of God, by his Authority, to pleaſe him? Am I the Meſſenger and Preacher of Man, or of God? Which do I ſerve, and ſeek to pleaſe? For if I pleaſe Men as their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, I am none of Chriſts Servant.</p>
               <p n="11">11. But I certifie you, brethren, that the goſpel which was preached of me, is not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter man.</p>

And I went up by revelation, and communicated unto them that goſpel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to them which were of reputation, leſt by any means I ſhould run, or had run in vain.</p>
               <p rend="small">1, 2.

               <p n="3">3. But neither Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed. 4. And that becauſe of falſe bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren unawares brought in, who came in privily to ſpie out our liberty which we have in Chriſt Jeſus, that they might bring us into bondage:</p>

                  <pb facs="tcp:66325:201"/>3, 4. And I would not yield that <hi>Titus</hi> ſhould be circumciſed, becauſe ſome falſe Brethren crept in to take advantage of the Liberty I uſed in compliance with the <hi>Jews,</hi> to take occaſion by it to bring us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to bondage to the <hi>Moſaick</hi> Law, and turn our Liberty into Neceſſity, and to plead that Conformity to it is our Duty, becauſe in ſome Degree and Caſe we yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to it as lawful, at the preſent, to avoid a greater hurt.</p>
               <p n="5">5. To whom we gave place by ſubjection, no not for an hour; that the truth of the goſpel might continue with you.</p>
               <p rend="small">5. <hi>Note,</hi> That an outward Act of Compliance, which in ſome Caſes may be lawful, muſt not be done when it will ſtrengthen Church-Tyrants and Decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, who by making it neceſſary, would turn Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Liberty into Bondage.</p>
               <p n="6">6. But of theſe who ſeemed to be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what, (whatſoever they were, it maketh no matter to me: God accepteth no mans per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon) for they who ſeemed to be ſomewhat in conferrence added nothing to me.</p>
               <p rend="small">But even <hi>Peter, James,</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> who were the Chief Men, and of Reputation, (God tieth not his Grace to the Dignity of Mens Perſons, therefore my Caſe dependeth not on their Worth:) I ſay, in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference they added nothing to me, much leſs taught me any other Goſpel than I had learned of Chriſt, nor found me faulty or defective in my Doctrine.</p>
               <p n="7">7. But contrariwiſe, when they ſaw that the goſpel of the uncircumciſion was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted unto me, as the goſpel of the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion was unto Peter; 8. (For he that wrought effectually in Peter to the Apoſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the circumciſion, the ſame was mighty in me towards the Gentiles) 9. And when James, Cephas, and John, who ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given unto me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowſhip; that we ſhould go unto the heathen, and they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the circumciſion.</p>

                  <hi>Note,</hi> That Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> thus Paraphraſeth it; [<hi>into what City either of us entred—and ſo conſtitute ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Congregations in each City, of Jews and Gentiles.</hi>] And he, with <hi>Grotius,</hi> ſay, That the two Witneſſes, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. are the Biſhops and Churches of theſe two ſorts at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> If ſo, Cities had then more Biſhops and Churches than one.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Onely they would that we ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the poor; the ſame which I alſo was forward to do.</p>

               <p rend="small">
                  <hi>Note,</hi> That beſides the extraordinary Famine, the <hi>Jews</hi> were generally poorer than the <hi>Gentiles</hi>; 1. Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in a poor and narrow Country; 2. And having at firſt ſold and given their Lands to the Common Stock.</p>
               <p n="11">11. But when Peter was come to Antioch, I withſtood him to the face, becauſe he was to be blamed.</p>
               <p rend="small">11. I withſtood him Face to Face, becauſe he was blamed (or, to be blamed) as diſſembling.</p>
               <p n="12">12. For before that certain came from James, he did eat with the Gentiles: but when they were come he withdrew, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated himſelf, fearing them which were of the circumciſion. 13. And the other Jews diſſembled likewiſe with him; inſomuch that Barnabas alſo was carried away with their diſſimulation.</p>
               <p rend="small">12, 13. <hi>Note,</hi> 1. That it appeareth by this, that it was then the ordinary Practice of the Apoſtles and Chriſtians at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to obſerve the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> though they abſolved the <hi>Gentiles</hi> from it.</p>
               <p rend="small">2. That <hi>Peter</hi> did this to avoid the Diſpleaſure and Cenſure of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Chriſtians, in compliance with their Weakneſs, which is a lawful End.</p>
               <p rend="small">3. That his Fault lay in letting this weigh down a far greater Evil on the other ſide, <hi>viz.</hi> the danger of bringing the <hi>Gentiles</hi> under the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> by making it ſeem neceſſary. This Caſe is much like as if ſome doubtful thing ſhould by Canon or Cuſtom be impoſed on Chriſtians; and one Party ſaith, <hi>You may do it</hi>; and another ſaith, <hi>You muſt do it, or you ſin</hi>: And they that ſay <hi>we may,</hi> though they know it be <hi>unneceſſary,</hi> for fear of diſpleaſing the Impoſers, ſeparate from the Refuſers, and forbear Communion with them, and thereby harden them in their Errour, and would enſnare the reſt.</p>
               <p n="14">14. But when I ſaw that they walked not uprightly, according to the truth of the goſpel, I ſaid unto Peter before them all, If thou being a Jew, liveſt after the manner of Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, why compelleſt thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?</p>
               <p rend="small">14. When I ſaw that this Cauſe was not according to the plain ſimplicity of the Goſpel, nor anſwered the ends of our Preaching, but was the way to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to <hi>Judaiſm,</hi> I ſaid to <hi>Peter</hi> before all (becauſe the Caſe concerned all) ſeeing thy own

Practice before the <hi>Jews</hi> came, ſheweth that thou thinkeſt not that the <hi>Gentiles</hi> are bound to live as the <hi>Jews</hi> do after <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law, why doſt thou now ſeem to tell them the contrary by thy contrary Practices, as if <hi>Judaizing</hi> were neceſſary to them?</p>
               <p n="15">15, 16. We who are Jews by nature, and not ſinners of the Gentiles, knowing that a man is not juſtified by the works of the law, but; by the faith of Jeſus Chriſt, even we have believed in Jeſus Chriſt that we might be juſtified by the faith of Chriſt, and not by the works of the law: for by works of the law ſhall no fleſh be juſtified.</p>
               <p rend="small">15, 16. We our ſelves who are <hi>Jews</hi> by birth, and not the Seed of Heathen Idolaters, yet knowing that it is not by the works of the Law, but by Faith in Chriſt that we muſt be juſtified have become Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians that we might be juſtified by this, and not by the Works of the Law, which none are juſtified by: And ſhall our Practice, now ſeem to intimate the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, and gainſay our Faith?</p>
               <p n="17">17. But if while we ſeek to be juſtified by Chriſt, we our ſelves alſo are found ſinners, is therefore Chriſt the miniſter of ſin? God forbid.</p>
               <p rend="small">17. For if you feign us to be ſinners, and guilty of Gentiliſm, becauſe we communicate with the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſed, you hereby would make Chriſt to be our Leader and Teacher to ſin; for it it is he that taught us this: And dare you charge Chriſt with Sin?</p>
               <p n="18">18. For if I build again the things which I deſtroyed, I make my ſelf a tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour.</p>
               <p rend="small">18. For if we that have preached Deliverance from the Law, and that it doth not juſtifie us, do now intimate the contrary by our Practice, we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs our ſelves Sinners in teaching ſuch Doctrine here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore.</p>
               <p n="19">19. For I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live unto God.</p>
               <p rend="small">19. The Law it ſelf hath taught me not to truſt it for Juſtification, nor to live in the Bondage of it, but to look for Life towards God by Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="20">20. I am crucified with Chriſt: Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs I live; yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the fleſh, I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himſelf for me.</p>

As Chriſt was crucified, and took away this Wall of Separation, and Yoke of Bondage; ſo I am now a Member of his Body, the Catholick Church, and am dead to the Law, and it to me: But I have a better Life, by which Chriſt liveth in me, both ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectively, as truſted, and loved; and efficiently, by his Spirit. And now it is by Faith in him, who loved me, and gave himſelf for me, that I live.</p>
               <p n="21">21. I do not fruſtrate the grace of God: for if righteouſneſs come by the law, then Chriſt is dead in vain.</p>
               <p rend="small">21. I do not by returning to the Law make void all the Deſign of Grace in our Redemption: Chriſt is dead in vain, if Righteouſneſs muſt be by our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi>; for what need we then any other Sacrifice for ſin, or to be Redeemed from its Curſe?</p>

                  <pb facs="tcp:66325:202"/>
                  <hi>Note,</hi> That here is a ſtrong Evidence for the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Fact, That the Gift of the Spirit, and the Working of Miracles, were then things certainly exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent: Elſe when <hi>Paul</hi> appealed to theſe ſeduced <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latians</hi> themſelves, as to Men that had the Spirit and theſe Miracles among them, and that with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking Words of [<hi>fooliſh</hi> and <hi>bewitched</hi>], how eaſily would they have confuted him, and ſaid, They knew of no ſuch thing? This had been the likelieſt way to turn them from Chriſtianity with ſcorn, to make that his Proof, which, if falſe, muſt be ſo known to them all.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Even as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteouſneſs. 7. Know ye therefore, that they which are of faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the ſame are the children of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</p>
               <p rend="small">6, 7. As it was by believing and truſting Gods Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, that <hi>Abraham</hi> was accounted righteous; ſo it followeth, that it is Believers that are his Seed as Heirs of the Promiſe.</p>
               <p n="8">8. And the ſcripture foreſeeing that God would juſtifie the heathen through faith, preached before the goſpel unto Abraham, <hi>ſaying,</hi> In thee ſhall all nations be bleſſed.</p>
               <p rend="small">8. And the Scripture foretelling that God would juſtifie the Heathen, as he did <hi>Abraham,</hi> by Faith, did in effect preach this Goſpel to him then, when it's ſaid, [<hi>In thee ſhall all Nations be bleſſed,</hi>] and therefore not the Jewiſh Nation onely.</p>
               <p n="9">9. So then they which be of faith, are bleſſed with faithful Abraham.</p>
               <p rend="small">9, So that if the Promiſe be made to them in <hi>Abraham,</hi> they that have the ſame Qualification of Faith, muſt needs be they that are bleſſed in him, though they keep not the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> did not, nor the <hi>Gentile</hi> Believers.</p>
               <p n="10">10. For as many as are of the works of the law, are under the curſe: for it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, Curſed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them.</p>
               <p rend="small">10. For all that truſt for Juſtification and Life, to their own doing the Works of that Law, and not to the free Grace of God in Chriſt, muſt needs be cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and not juſtified by it: For it ſaith, <hi>Curſed is every one that continueth not, &amp;c.</hi> which no man doth.</p>
               <p n="11">11. But that no man is juſtified by the law in the ſight of God, it is evident: for, The juſt ſhall live by faith. 12. And the law is not of faith: but, The man that doth them, ſhall live in them.</p>
               <p rend="small">11, 12. It's evident, that before God none is juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the Law: For it's ſaid, that <hi>The juſt by faith ſhall live</hi>: But the Law conſidered in it ſelf, as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from the Promiſe, doth not give Life on condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Faith receiving it as a free Gift, but on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of doing all that it commandeth, (Though the Law, as ſubordinate to the Promiſe, be of Faith.)</p>
               <p n="13">13. Chriſt hath reedeemed us from the curſe of the law, being made a curſe for us: for it is written, Curſed is every one that hangeth on a tree:</p>
               <p rend="small">13. That Law which curſeth us, doth not juſtifie us: but ſo doth <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law: and therefore came Chriſt to redeem us from that Curſe, ſuffering as a Sacrifice for us a curſed Death.</p>
               <p n="14">14. That the bleſſing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jeſus Chriſt; that we might receive the promiſe of the Spirit through faith.</p>
               <p rend="small">14. That the Bleſſing which was pronounced to <hi>Abraham</hi> as a Believer, might come on all (<hi>Jews</hi> and) <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who are Believers; and we might through Faith receive the promiſed Gift of the Holy Ghoſt, (as we have done.)</p>
               <p n="15">15. Brethren, I ſpeak after the manner of men; Though it be but a mans covenant, yet if it be confirmed, no man diſanulleth or addeth thereto. 16.

Even Men preſume not to violate Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants: And Gods Promiſe to <hi>Abraham</hi> was to him and his Seed, which immediately was <hi>Iſaac,</hi> prefiguring Chriſt eminently: (Though as all the Carnal Seed alſo ſprang from <hi>Iſaac,</hi> ſo all Believers be included as ſpringing from Chriſt.)</p>
               <p n="17">17. And this I ſay, <hi>that</hi> the covenant that was confirmed before of God in Chriſt, the law which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot diſſanul, that it ſhould make the promiſe of none effect.</p>
               <p rend="small">17. And ſo the Covenant to <hi>Abraham,</hi> as the Father of the Faithful, including a Promiſe of Chriſt and his Seed by Faith, was not nulled by the Law, which was Four hundred and thirty years after: But if Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation before was by Faith, it muſt be ſo ſtill, and ſo all true Believers juſtified.</p>
               <p n="18">18. For if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more of promiſe: but God gave it to Abraham by promiſe.</p>
               <p rend="small">18. For if the Bleſſing meant in that Covenant with <hi>Abraham</hi> be given on condition of keeping <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>'s Law, then cometh it not by free gift, as it did to <hi>Abraham</hi> by that Promiſe: But God gave it freely by Promiſe to <hi>Abraham,</hi> without his keeping that Law.</p>
               <p n="19">19. Wherefore then ſerveth the law? It was added becauſe of tranſgreſſion, till the ſeed ſhould come, to whom the promiſe was
<pb facs="tcp:66325:203"/>
made; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.</p>
               <p rend="small">19. To what uſe then was the Law given? To convince Men of Sin, and reſtrain them from it, and make them know the need of a Mediating Saviour; whom <hi>Moſes</hi> typified as a Mediator, in receiving the Law from the Miniſtry of Angels.</p>
               <p n="20">20. Now a mediator is not a mediator of one, but God is one.</p>
               <p rend="small">20. Now Mediation is between two Parties: Of theſe, that God is one who made the Promiſe to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and juſtified him by Faith, and ſurely is not mutable.</p>
               <p n="21">21. Is the law then againſt the promiſes of God? God forbid: for if there had been a law given which could have given life, verily righteouſneſs ſhould have been by the law.</p>
               <p rend="small">21. And hath this One God contradicted his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes by his Law? By no means: Therefore he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended not that the Works of the Law ſhould be our juſtifying Righteouſneſs; which it muſt have been, if it could have given Life by the meritorious keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it: and ſo God ſhould have overthrown his former way of Juſtification.</p>
               <p n="22">22. But the ſcripture hath concluded all under ſin, that the promiſe by faith of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt might be given to them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.</p>
               <p rend="small">22. But the Scripture tells us, that all Men are under the Guilt of Sin, and the Law doth not juſtifie Sinners that break it: Therefore none can be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by it. And this it doth, to teach us to look for Life by a Promiſed Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="23">23. But before faith came, we were kept under the law, ſhut up unto the faith which ſhould afterwards be revealed.</p>
               <p rend="small">23. But before the Goſpel and Chriſt Incarnate came, which now as Objects conſtitute our Faith, we <hi>Jews</hi> were under the reſtraint and tutorage of the Law, to teach us to wait for Chriſt, who is the Truth and End of the Law.</p>
               <p n="24">24. Wherefore the law was our ſchool-maſter to bring us unto Chriſt, that we might be juſtified by faith.</p>
               <p rend="small">24. And ſo the Law to us <hi>Jews</hi> was ſuited to our Youth and Rudeneſs, to keep us as a School-maſter in a learning and reſtrained State, and prepare us for the Goſpel, and teach us to look for Juſtification by Faith in Chriſt alone.</p>
               <p n="25">25. But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a ſchool-maſter.</p>
               <p rend="small">25. But now Chriſt is fully revealed to our Faith, we are no longer under that preparatory Tutorage of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law.</p>
               <p n="26">26. For ye are all the children of God by faith in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
               <p rend="small">26. For now all you that are ſincere Believers, are from under the bondage of legal ſervile Tasks and Fears, and are taken into the Family of God, as his adopted Children, by Chriſt, whom you believe in. And all of you profeſs your ſelves to ſtand in this Relation and Hope.</p>
               <p n="27">27. For as many of you as have been bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized into Chriſt, have put on Chriſt.</p>
               <p rend="small">27. For as many of you as have ſincerely conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Baptiſmal Covenant, and ſo been baptized into the Faith of Chriſt, and Relation to him, have thereby even put him on as your Garment, and wholly given up your ſelves to him, and ſo as his Members are united to him: And all that are bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed have profeſſed this, which the Sincere perform.</p>
               <p n="28">28. There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther male nor female: for ye are all one in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
               <p rend="small">28. So that the difference between <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Greek,</hi> Bond and Free, Male and Female, maketh no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in your Relation to Chriſt, and your Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Salvation by him.</p>

               <p n="4">4. But when the fulneſs of the time was come, God ſent forth his Son made of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, made under the law, 5. To redeem

them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of ſons.</p>
               <p rend="small">4, 5. But when God, who carrieth on his Works from low Beginnings to Perfection, ſaw it meet to uſe us as at Maturity, he ſent his Son into the World, whoſe Humanity was made of a Woman, made under the Law, which he perfectly fulfilled, that he might redeem thoſe that were under the Law from its Bondage and Curſe, that they might henceforth ſerve him as Sons, not in Legal Terrour, but in Love and Joy.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And becauſe ye are ſons, God hath ſent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.</p>
               <p rend="small">6. And as Fathers communicate their Natures to their Children, (and not onely their Names and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance) ſo God having called you in Chriſt by Grace into this State of Adoption, from the Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Sin and the Law, hath ſealed you with his Sanctifying Spirit, whereby in the Belief of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly Love to you in Chriſt, your new Natures are inclined to love and truſt him, and depend on him, and ſeek to him in all your Wants and Streights, as Children to their Parents. This is your Mark of Adoption.</p>

                  <hi>Note,</hi> That as <hi>Adoption</hi> is taken in two ſenſes and degrees, ſo is the Gift of the Spirit. 1. To be ſo far Redeemed by Chriſt, as to be brought from under Sin and the Law and Curſe, into a State of Sonſhip and Life, by a Conditional Deed of Gift or Promiſe, that is, ſo Men will accept and not reject the Gift; this is a Conditional Adoption, and with this there goeth a meaſure of the Spirits Operation, which ſhould draw all, and doth draw the Elect to the firſt true Faith and Repentance, by Vocation.</p>
               <p rend="small">2. But to thoſe that thus actually believe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and ſo receive Chriſt, and are united to him, is given with him the Gift and Relation of actual Adoption; and theſe have actually the Spirit of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, Love, and Adoption, even poſſeſſing them.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Wherefore thou art no more a ſervant, but a ſon; and if a ſon, then an heir of God through Chriſt.</p>
               <p rend="small">7. So that now you are not Slaves, or meer Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, ruled by conſtraint of fear, and ſo not under the bondage of that Law, which doth work by cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Terrour; but you are Sons, and under a Father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Government; and if Sons, then have you right to the Inheritance by Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Howbeit, then when ye knew not God, ye did ſervice unto them which by nature are no gods.</p>

               <p n="14">14. For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this; Thou ſhalt love thy neighbour as thy ſelf.</p>
               <p rend="small">14. You are ſtill under a Law; but it is the Law of Love, which, in the Duties which you owe to Man, is fulfilled, if you do but love your Neighbours, as your ſelves, (ſuppoſing that you love your ſelves with a well-guided Love.)</p>

It is the Spirit that the Fleſh luſteth againſt; and it is the Spirit that is contrarily inclined, and muſt overcome it. Theſe contrary Inclinations keep you in ſuch imperfection, that you cannot be as good and blameleſs as you would be, (and therefore Grace muſt pardon you.)</p>

               <p rend="small">2. That proud high thoughts of our ſelves, and Contempt, Cenſoriouſneſs, and Hurtfulneſs to others, and not forbearing tollerable Offenders, are contrary to Chriſtianity, and the Cauſe of Diviſions in the Church: And by theſe the carnal perſecuting Seed, eſpecially when they invade the Sacred Office, are differenced from true Chriſtians, as Wolves from Sheep, even when, as the falſe Prophets, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the Cauſe and Name of Chriſt.</p>

Saying, Honour thy Father and Mother: And though general Promiſes be intimated in the Firſt and Second Commandment, this is the firſt Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that hath annexed the Promiſe of the Land which God was then leading the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to; as it is ſaid,</p>

               <p rend="small">
                  <hi>Note,</hi> That accordingly, Gods Curſe on Earth doth uſually follow Children that diſhonour and wrong their Parents, and rebell againſt them; and uſually even Earthly Bleſſings are given to thoſe that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and obey Parents (under God.)</p>
               <p n="4">4. And ye fathers, provoke not your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to wrath: but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.</p>
               <p rend="small">4. And let Parents remember, that Childrens cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Nature and Weakneſs are liable to ſuch Paſſions as may pervert them: and therefore let not your ſowr and provoking Government and Carriage tempt them hereto, beyond their ſtrength: but govern them with Fatherly Love, and bring them up to the Knowledge and Obedience of the Lord, by wiſe and diligent Teaching, Example, Admonition, and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcipline.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Servants, be obedient to them that are your maſters according to the fleſh, with fear and trembling, in ſingleneſs of your heart, as unto Chriſt.</p>
               <p rend="small">5. And let not Servants think that Chriſtianity freeth them from Service, or from Obedience, Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, or Reverence to their Maſters, though they be Unbelievers: but give them all due Obedience, and reverent Submiſſion, and this in conſcience and ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, as part of your Obedience to Chriſt, who doth command it, and will reward you.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Not with eye-ſervice, as men-pleaſers, but as the ſervants of Chriſt, doing the will of God from the heart;</p>

               <p rend="small">7. I repeat it, becauſe it greatly concerneth you, that you do all your Service faithfully and willingly, without grudging; and that not as a bare Service to Man, but as a part of your Service to the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, which he hath preſcribed, and will accept.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Knowing that whatſoever good thing any man doth, the ſame ſhall he receive of the Lord, whether he be bond or free.</p>
               <p rend="small">8. Be ſure of this, That your loweſt and hardeſt Service being your Duty, is a good Work; and ſuch Works of Fidelity in the loweſt Bond-ſervants are accepted of God, as well as the more honoured Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Greateſt.</p>
               <p n="9">9. And ye maſters, do the ſame things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, forbearing threatning: knowing that your maſter alſo is in heaven, neither is there reſpect of perſons with him.</p>
               <p rend="small">9. And you that are Maſters, ſee that you be as careful of your Part to your Servants, as you would have them be of their Duty to you; and rule them not tyrannically, by inſulting and paſſionate Menaces and Reproaches: Knowing that Chriſt in Heaven is equally the Lord of them and you, and will not be partial to you for your Wealth or Superiority, but will equally do Juſtice unto all.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Finally, my brethren, be ſtrong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.</p>

And that univerſal ſincere Obedience to God, and Upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Life towards all Men, joined to your Pardon through the Merits of Chriſt, may be to you as a Breaſt-plate is to Soldiers in Fight, that no Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary may have Matter of juſt Accuſation againſt you. 3. And that the Goſpel of Chriſt, which ſpeaketh Peace to the World, and to your ſelves, may ſo dwell in your Hearts, to make you Men of Peace, and in your Mouths to invite others to Peace with God and one another, that it may be to you as thoſe Shoes were to Soldiers, which they put on when they went to War, to keep their Feet from hurt and danger.</p>

                  <hi>Note,</hi> 1. That Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> affirming, That <hi>Paul</hi> meant here all the Biſhops and Deacons in <hi>Macedonia,</hi> or a whole Province, doth this without any cogent Proof; as he ſaith the like of <hi>Corinth, Epheſus, &amp;c.</hi> though it may be granted, that conſequently they to whom theſe Epiſtles were written, were to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate them to as many as they could.</p>

Thus ſome preach the ſame Chriſt that I do, but contentiouſly, and not in ſincerity, and love, and meekneſs, but to add to my Bonds the Affliction of Mens Contempt and Diſaffection, to turn the Hearts of People from me and my Miniſtry.

               <p rend="small">20. For, as it is my earneſt expectation, ſo it is my comfortable hope, that whether it be by my Life or Death, all that befalls my Body ſhall be to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Chriſt, and then I have my End.</p>
               <p n="21">21. For to me to live is Chriſt, and to die is gain.</p>
               <p rend="small">21. For to me to live, is to ſerve and honour Chriſt; he is the End of my Life, and his Work the Buſineſs; it is for Chriſt that I live; and if I die, it will be my gain.</p>

               <p rend="small">23. For it is to me a great difficulty to know which is more deſirable: I would fain be with Chriſt, which is far better for me than to be here.</p>

               <p rend="small">26. That when you ſee me with you again, you may greatly for my ſake rejoice in Chriſt.</p>

               <p n="29">29. For unto you it is given in the behalf of Chriſt, not onely to believe on him, but alſo to ſuffer for his ſake;</p>
               <p rend="small">29. For it is a great addition to your Honour and Felicity, that God hath given you this Bleſſing, not onely to believe on Chriſt as Chriſtians, but to ſuffer for him as Martyrs. (For by this you have the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of the greateſt Reward.)</p>

               <p n="1">1. FInally, my brethren, rejoyce in the Lord. To write the ſame things to you, to me indeed is not grievous, but for you it is ſafe.</p>
               <p rend="small">1. Finally Brethren, ſerve God with joyful hearts: That I write to you the ſame things which I have formerly taught you, and warned you of, is not through ſloth of cowardiſe in me, but for your own ſafety, as fitteſt for you.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Beware of dogs, beware of evil work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, beware of the conciſion.</p>
               <p rend="small">2. To wit, that you take heed of the worrying, hurtful ſort of Men, who live in wickedneſs, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling themſelves the <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> are indeed the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion,</hi> that cut and rend the Churches.</p>
               <p n="3">3. For we are the circumciſion, which worſhip God in the Spirit, and rejoyce in Chriſt Jeſus, and have no confidence in the fleſh.</p>
               <p rend="small">3. For we are the Children of Circumciſed <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> who worſhip God in Spirit and Truth, and have no confidence in Fleſhly Priviledges, or Carnal Ceremonious, Jewiſh Worſhip.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Though I might alſo have confidence in the fleſh. If any other man thinketh that he hath whereof he might truſt in the fleſh, I more:</p>
               <p rend="small">4. Though if <hi>Judaiſm</hi> were matter of truſt or boaſting, I have more ſuch cauſe than any of them.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Circumciſed the eighth day, of the ſtock of Iſrael, of the tribe of Benjamin, an Hebrew of the Hebrews; as touching the law, a Phariſee; 6. Concerning zeal, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting the church; touching the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs which is in the law, blameleſs.</p>
               <p rend="small">5, 6. I was Circumciſed as the Law required, I was an <hi>Iſraelite,</hi> a <hi>Benjamite,</hi> an <hi>Hebrew,</hi> a <hi>Phariſee,</hi> the ſtricteſt Sect in Religion; not cold in Religion, but a zealous perſecutor of the Church, which I thought had been againſt it: And as to the outward obſervance of the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> I ſeemed to Men ſo juſt and harmleſs, that none accuſed me.</p>
               <p n="7">7. But what things were gain to me, thoſe I counted loſs for Chriſt.</p>
               <p rend="small">7. But I willingly diſclaim all confidence in theſe, and reject all as loſs that would keep me from Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Yea doubtleſs, and I count all things but loſs, for the excellency of the knowledge of Chriſt Jeſus my Lord: for whom I have ſuffered the loſs of all things, and do count them but dung that I may win Chriſt,</p>
               <p rend="small">8, 9. Yea, I reject all as loſs and hurtful to me, which ſtand againſt the excellency of the knowledge of Chriſt, for whom I have readily ſuffered the loſs of all things, and count them but as Dung in order to my part in Chriſt, and that I may be found in him.</p>
               <p n="9">9. And be found in him, not having mine own righteouſneſs, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Chriſt, the righteouſneſs which is of God by faith:</p>
               <p rend="small">9. Not having and truſting not in that Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which conſiſteth in keeping the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which is of my own Works, and I accounted former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be my juſtifying Righteouſneſs; but that which is of Faith in Chriſt, even the Righteouſneſs which is of Gods free Gift by believing acceptance of his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed and offered Grace.</p>
               <p n="10">10. That I may know him, and the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of his reſurrection, and the fellowſhip of his ſuffering, being made conformable unto his death.</p>
               <p rend="small">10. By which I ſhall gain the knowledge of Chriſt, and of the great Myſtery of Salvation by him, and the powerful work of his Grace and quickening Spirit and preſerving Providence, anſwering in his Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers that power that raiſed him from the Dead, and a Communion with him in ſufferings, by which I ſhall be made conformable to him as Crucified for our ſins; and thus in all be made as a Member ſuitable to him that is my Head.</p>
               <p n="11">11. If by any means I might attain unto the reſurrection of the dead:</p>
               <p rend="small">11. In hope that by all theſe means and methods (which I account not too dear) I may at laſt attain that bleſſed perfection in which I ſhall be alſo like him, as he is now riſen from the Dead, and glorified, in the ſtate of Immortality.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect: but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which alſo I am apprehended of Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.</p>
               <p rend="small">12. Not that I have already attained this Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to my Glorified Lord, or were already perfect, by reaching all that I purſue: But I run as for this Prize, and earneſtly ſtrive, that at laſt I may lay hold on and attain the ſtate of Glory, to bring me to which Jeſus Chriſt did elect, redeem, and call me to himſelf.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Brethren, I count not my ſelf to have apprehended: but this one thing I do, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting thoſe things which are behind, and reaching forth unto thoſe things which are before, 14. I preſs toward the mark, for the prize of the high calling of God in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
               <p rend="small">
                  <pb facs="tcp:66325:216"/>13, 14. I know I have not yet attained the end that I ran for, even glorious Perfection: But this I do, not minding the things of the World which I have forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, but neglecting and forgetting them, and with all my might and diligence ſtriving towards the things which are before, I preſs or haſten towards the Mark, for that glorious Crown and Prize, for obtaining whereof, the high Calling of God by Jeſus Chriſt hath encouraged me to ſeek and hope.</p>
               <p n="15">15. Let us therefore, as many as be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect be thus minded: and if in any thing ye be otherwiſe minded, God ſhall reveal even this unto you.</p>
               <p rend="small">15. And let all that are ſound and ſincere Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, holding theſe things that are neceſſary to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, be thus minded, and with joint endeavour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing our Defects, thus preſs toward the End of our Faith in Love: And then, if through imperfection of Knowledge you come ſhort, and differ in other things, while you wait on God in Humility, Love, and Peace, God will in time make you know what yet is wanting to you.</p>
               <p n="16">16. Nevertheleſs, whereto we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready attained, let us walk by the ſame rule, let us mind the ſame thing.</p>
               <p rend="small">16. But let all that have attained ſoundneſs in theſe neceſſary Eſſentials of Chriſtianity, ſtill live accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to theſe Goſpel-Truths which we all acknowledge, and in Love and Concord practiſe and promote theſe things in which we are agreed.</p>
               <p rend="small">
                  <hi>Note,</hi> How directly <hi>Paul</hi> condemneth both Church-Tyrants and Sectaries, the former ſilencing, reviling, and perſecuting, and the other reproachfully cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and ſeparating from thoſe that agree in all here inſtanced, for not conſenting to needleſs Trifles of the Clergies impoſition, or to the Errours of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious ignorant Men.</p>
               <p n="17">17. Brethren, be followers together of me, and mark them which walk ſo, as ye have us for an enſample.</p>
               <p rend="small">17. God that hath ſent me to teach you, hath here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in alſo made me an Enſample to you; I beſeech you therefore herein follow me, (in humble ſtriving to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Perfection, uniting in ſincere Chriſtianity, and bearing in other things with each other, till God teach you the reſt.)</p>
               <p n="18">18. (For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that they are the enemies of the croſs of Chriſt: 19. Whoſe end is deſtruction, whoſe God is their belly: and whoſe glory is in their ſhame, who mind earthly thingſ.)</p>
               <p rend="small">18, 19. For many, of whom I have oft told you, and now mention them with Tears, for their own fakes and the Churches, do ſo live, as that while they are called <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> they are ſuch Enemies to the bearing of the Croſs, in following a Crucified Chriſt, that they will ſuffer nothing for their Faith: For taking up Chriſtianity notionally in their Brains, without the Life and Power on their Hearts, the World was never overcome, or their Luſt mortified by it; ſo that their Belly, or fleſhly Luſt, is the God which they moſt love and obey; and while they glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that they know more of Chriſtian Liberty than we do, and ſo may lawfully pleaſe fleſhly Luſts, it is their Shame and Bru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tiſhneſs which they glory in: and therefore Deſtruction will be their end.</p>
               <p n="20">20. For our converſation is in heaven, from whence alſo we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt: 21. Who ſhall change our vile body, that it may be faſhion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed like unto his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due all things unto himſelf.</p>
               <p rend="small">20, 21. But our City freedom, Relation, Treaſure, Converſe, and Buſineſs is in Heaven, among the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Society, in the <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> above; From thence, by Faith and joyful Hope, we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jeſus, who is our Head and Interceſſour there; and who will not onely receive our Souls at death, but will alſo change theſe vile Bodies, (which being made of the low diſſoluble Elements, are a clog to our Souls, and muſt corrupt like the Fleſh of Bruits) and will make them like his own now-glorious Body, (ſpiritual, incorruptible, and glorious;) and this he can and will do, how unlikely ſoever it appears to us, by the exerciſe of his Omnipotency, by which he can conquer all Difficulties and Enemies, for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhing of the Work of the Salvation of his Church.</p>
               <p rend="small">
                  <hi>Note,</hi> 1. That the great difference between miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Hypocrites and ſound Chriſtians is, that the former ſet moſt by Fleſh and Earth, and the latter by the Hopes of Heaven, to which they ſubject all worldly Intereſt, and on which and for which they live and labour moſt, as Worldlings do for a Worldly Welfare.</p>
               <p rend="small">2. That a falſe, ſenſual, worldly, unmortified Heart, betrayeth Hypocrites into worldly ſenſual Opinions and Hereſies, and they eaſily believe all to be lawful which maketh for their fleſhly worldly Intereſts and Luſts, becauſe their falſe Hearts would have it to be lawful.</p>

               <head>CHAP. IV.</head>
               <p n="1">1. THerefore, my brethren, dearly belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and longed for, my joy and crown, ſo ſtand faſt in the Lord, my dearly beloved.</p>
               <p rend="small">1. <hi>Note,</hi> That the moſt amiable Chriſtians have need of Warning and earneſt Exhortation againſt Backſliding by Temptation and Deceivers.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I beſeech Euodias, and beſeech Synti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che,
<pb facs="tcp:66325:216"/>
that they be of the ſame mind in the Lord.</p>
               <p rend="small">2. <hi>Note,</hi> It's like he heard of Contention between theſe two, which he beſeecheth them to ceaſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And I intreat thee alſo, true yokefel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, help thoſe women which laboured with me in the goſpel, with Clement alſo, and with other my fellow labourers, whoſe names are in the book of life.</p>
               <p rend="small">3. And I intreat thee, my true Fellow-labourer, (it's like he meaneth <hi>Epaphroditus,</hi> but uncertain:) take care of thoſe Women that furthered our Work, (by entertaining us, and ſuffering for the Faith,) with <hi>Clement,</hi> and other Helpers, who are of the number of thoſe that God will own.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Rejoyce in the Lord alway, and again I ſay, Rejoyce.</p>
               <p rend="small">4. Rejoice in the Intereſt you have in the Lord, his Grace, and Protection, and Promiſe of Glory: Yea, I again urge it on you, <hi>Always rejoice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p rend="small">
                  <hi>Note,</hi> 1. That Chriſtians even in a ſtate of oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the World, have always greater cauſe of rejoicing in God, than of ſorrow for the World, (Though if they wilfully ſin, it may interrupt their Joy, by making them unfit for it, as Wounds and Sickneſs do the Body.)</p>
               <p rend="small">2. That holy Joy in the Lord is that Flower of Religion which all Chriſtians ſhould deſire, and chiefly labour to attain.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Let your moderation be known unto all men. The Lord is at hand.</p>
               <p rend="small">5. Let all Men ſee that you put the beſt ſenſe on all that befals you from God and Man, and that you take nothing by impatience or uncharitableneſs at the worſt, but can ſuffer Injuries: For God is with you, and the day of his delivering you is near.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Be careful for nothing: but in every thing by prayer and ſupplication with thankſgiving, let your requeſts be made known unto God.</p>
               <p rend="small">6. Let no Want or Danger diſturb your Mind with anxious diſtruſtful Cares; but in every Caſe, go and open it to God in Prayer, for your ſelves and others, with Thankſgiving for what you have received, as beſeemeth thoſe who truly truſt in God.</p>
               <p n="7">7. And the peace of God which paſſeth all underſtanding, ſhall keep your hearts and minds through Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
               <p rend="small">7. And by this Lenity of Mind, and Truſt in God by Prayer, the Peace which you ſhall have in Gods Love to you, in your own Souls, and in Concord with the Church, which is of ineſtimable value, above much notional Knowledge, ſhall, as a Garriſon, keep your Affections from diſturbance, and your Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from Errour, through the Grace of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Finally, brethren, whatſoever things are true, whatſoever things are honeſt, whatſoever things are juſt, whatſoever things are pure, whatſoever things are love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whatſoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praiſe, think on theſe things.</p>
               <p rend="small">8. In general, to conclude, Be ſure that you cleave to Truth, againſt Falſhood; to things ſeemly and venerable, againſt things ſhameful; to things juſt, againſt Injuſtice; to things pure, againſt Luſt and Pollution; to things truly amiable, againſt deceiving Paint and flattering Allurements; to things deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly of good report and approved by Men, againſt Scandal. In a word, Let all things that are truly virtuous and praiſe-worthy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be faithfully minded and followed by you.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Thoſe things which ye have both learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and received, and heard and ſeen in me, do: and the God of peace ſhall be with you.</p>
               <p rend="small">9. Practice the Doctrine which you have heard and received from me, and the good Example which you have ſeen in me; and the God of Love and Peace will be with you, thus walking in Love and Peace.</p>
               <p n="10">10. But I rejoyced in the Lord greatly, that now at the laſt your care of me hath flouriſhed again, wherein ye were alſo care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, but ye lacked opportunity.</p>
               <p rend="small">10. I was glad, and thanked God, that your Care of my Supply at laſt revived; not that I ſuppoſe it dead before, but that you lacked opportunity of ſending to me, rather than Will, and Care of me.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Not that I ſpeak in reſpect of want: for I have learned in whatſoever ſtate I am, therewith to be content.</p>
               <p rend="small">11. I mean not that I ſo much rejoice that my Wants were ſupplied: For I have learned to be of a quiet and contented Mind, in whatever Condition God ſhall bring me.</p>
               <p n="12">12. I know both how to be abaſed, and I know how to abound: every where, and in all things I am inſtructed, both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to ſuffer need.</p>
               <p rend="small">12. I know how to be in a low and poor Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, without repining; and how to have Plenty, without ſenſuality and abuſe: I have learn'd how to live in every Place and Caſe, both to be fully provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and to be in hunger through poverty, to abound, and to ſuffer need, and glorifie God in all.</p>
               <p n="13">13. I can do all things through Chriſt which ſtrengtheneth me.</p>
               <p rend="small">13. All this is but my Duty; and Chriſt will ſtrengthen me for all that he calls me to.</p>
               <p n="14">14. Notwithſtanding, ye have well done,
<pb facs="tcp:66325:217"/>
that ye did communicate with my affliction.</p>
               <p rend="small">14. But this Communication for my Supply in my Suffering for the Goſpel, was your Duty, and you did well in doing it.</p>
               <p n="15">15. Now ye Philippians know alſo, that in the beginning of the goſpel, when I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from Macedonia, no church com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated with me, as concerning giving and receiving, but ye onely.</p>
               <p rend="small">15. I ſuppoſe you know that this Honour of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing to me was due onely to you, when I firſt had preached the Goſpel in <hi>Macedonia,</hi> no other Church doing the like at my departure.</p>
               <p n="16">16. For even in Theſſalonica ye ſent once and again unto my neceſſity.</p>
               <p rend="small">16. <hi>Note,</hi> How much profeſſed Chriſtians differ in Liberality, as they do in Charity.</p>
               <p n="17">17. Not becauſe I deſire a gift: but I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire fruit that may abound to your account.</p>
               <p rend="small">17. Not that I am craving more by commending you, or value moſt my own Supplies; but I commend and deſire your Fruitfulneſs in Good Works, that it may abound to your own conſolation, when you muſt be accountable for all to God.</p>
               <p n="18">18. But I have all, and abound: I am full, having received of Epaphroditus the things which were ſent from you, an odour of a ſweet ſmell, a ſacrifice acceptable, well-pleaſing to God.</p>
               <p rend="small">18. But I certifie you, that I received your Gift from <hi>Epaphroditus,</hi> and it was a very liberal Supply to me; and to encourage you, I add, That under and through Chriſt, the great propitiating Sacrifice, ſuch Works are the ſweet Incenſe and Sacrifice acceptable and pleaſing to God.</p>
               <p n="19">19. But my God ſhall ſupply all your need, according to his riches in glory, by Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
               <p rend="small">19. And my God, who employeth me in his Work, will ſee that you ſhall loſe nothing by furthering his Service, but, out of the Riches of his Glory by Chriſt, will give a more excellent Supply of all your Wants.</p>
               <p n="20">20. Now unto God and our Father be glory for ever and ever, Amen.</p>
               <p rend="small">20. Now to God, who is Love, and a Father to us through Chriſt, be Glory for all his Mercies, and for and by all his Works, for ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="21">21, 22, 23. Salute every ſaint in Chriſt Jeſus. The brethren which are with me greet you. All the ſaints ſalute you, chiefly they that are of Ceſars houſhold. The grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt be with you all, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>

               <p n="13">13. Who hath delivered us from the power of darkneſs, and hath tranſlated us into the kingdom of his dear Son:</p>
               <p rend="small">13. <hi>Note,</hi> The World is divided into two Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: One under the Power of Darkneſs, that is, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan the Prince of Darkneſs, who leads Men by the way of Ignorance, Errour, Unbelief, and Lies, to the utter Darkneſs of Miſery. The other is the Kingdom of Chriſt, led by him who is the Light of the World, by Truth, Knowledge, and Faith, to the Heavenly Light.</p>
               <p rend="small">2. When Men are truly converted to Chriſt, they are initially delivered from the Power, State, and Way of Darkneſs, into the Kingdom of Chriſt and Light.</p>

               <p n="15">15. Who is the image of the inviſible God, the firſt-born of every creature:</p>

In whoſe Humane Nature, Doctrine, and Works, the Inviſible God, whoſe Image he is, is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted to Man; and who in his Divine Nature was begotten of the Father before any Creature was made, (even from Eternity,) and in his Perſon, as God-Man, is moſt Excellent, and is Lord of all.</p>
               <p rend="small">(This [<hi>Firſt-born</hi>] numbreth him not with Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but ſets him above them.)</p>
               <p n="16">16. For by him were all things created that are in heaven, and that are in earth, viſible and inviſible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him. 17. And he is before all things, and by him all things conſiſt.</p>
               <p rend="small">16, 17. By him, as God, were all things created, and for him; and he is from Eternity before them all, and by him they are upheld in being.</p>

                  <hi>Note,</hi> 1. Some by [<hi>things in Heaven and Earth,</hi>] and [<hi>Thrones, Dominions, &amp;c.</hi>] underſtand onely [<hi>Jews and Gentiles</hi>] and [<hi>the Powers of Men</hi>]: But this forced Expoſition is groundleſs; it being certain, that all Heavenly Powers and Orders were created by the Eternal Word, and <hi>Paul</hi> being here extolling his Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence, why ſhould we feign him to leave out the higheſt Part, which he ſo plainly expreſſeth? That Celeſtial Spirits have potent Superiority both over us and one another, is no doubt.</p>
               <p rend="small">II. The ancient Churches and Hereticks had ſo great Contentions about the right Notions of the Nature and Perſon of Chriſt, and with ſuch diſmal Effects, as maketh many Lovers of Peace to wiſh, that ſuch Points had been handled more cautelouſly, reverently, and peaceably. Four notable Opinions there be about the Natures and Perſon of Chriſt.</p>
               <p rend="small">1. The Orthodox hold, That he hath onely two Natures in one Perſon, the Divine and Humane. And of theſe, the ſubtle Philoſophers ſay, that the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature is no <hi>part</hi> of his <hi>Perſon,</hi> but an Adjunct, becauſe God cannot be a <hi>Part.</hi> But others avoid this, as dangerous.</p>
               <p rend="small">2. The <hi>Arians</hi> think Chriſt is but a Creature, but is a Superangelical Spirit, the firſt created, by whom God made all the reſt; and that he aſſumed the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature, and may be well called God, but not as the Father is, nor of the ſame Subſtance: And ſo, that he hath two Natures, Superangelical and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane. Of theſe, 1. Some think that the Superan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical, as a Soul, aſſumed onely a Humane Body: And, 2. Some, that he aſſumed a Soul and Body.</p>
               <p rend="small">
                  <pb facs="tcp:66325:218"/>3. A third ſort ſay, Chriſt hath three Natures; 1. The <hi>Divine,</hi> producing by Emanation the firſt created <hi>Superangelical Nature,</hi> united to it ſelf, and by it creating all other things; and both theſe Natures in the fulneſs of time aſſuming the <hi>Humane Nature,</hi> (entire, ſay ſome; and a <hi>Body Onely,</hi> ſay others.)</p>
               <p rend="small">4. The laſt and worſt is that of the <hi>Socinians,</hi> that count Chriſt a meer Glorified Man. This Text ſeemeth to ſpeak but the firſt, though the Favourers of the third think it is for them; and that other Texts are ſo alſo. They think it was not onely the Divine Nature, but the Superangelical, which appeared to <hi>Abraham, Moſes, &amp;c.</hi> in a viſible Body, before the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation: And by aſſerting theſe three Natures in Chriſt, they would reconcile the Orthodox and the <hi>Arians.</hi> The Controverſies alſo whether Chriſt be two Perſons or but one, and have two Wills and Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, or but one, and whether it may be ſaid, That <hi>Mary</hi> was the Mother of God, and that one of the Trinity was crucified, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> did grievouſly rend the Church; of which I have ſpoken elſewhere, and plainly ſhewed in what ſenſe Chriſt is two, yea, many Perſons (relatively), and in what ſenſe but one; and in what ſenſe his Wills are two, and in what ſenſe but one.</p>
               <p n="18">18. And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firſt-born from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence.</p>
               <p rend="small">18. And he is now the Head, both by Government and quickning Influence, of the Church, which is his Body Politick, and united to him incomprehenſibly; the Spring of Life to us, and the firſt that roſe from Death to glorious Immortality, triumphantly, by his own Power; by whom it is that we live, and ſhall be raiſed: For in all things he is Higheſt, above all Creatures.</p>
               <p n="19">19. For it pleaſed the Father, that in him ſhould all fulneſs dwell;</p>
               <p rend="small">19. For it ſeemed good to the Father that Jeſus Chriſt ſhould be filled with all Created Perfection, as well as he hath Divine Perfection, and be the Spring and Treaſure of all Good, as the Head over all things to his Church, and the Univerſal Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrator.</p>
               <p n="20">20. And (having made peace through the blood of his croſs) by him to reconcile all things unto himſelf, by him, I ſay, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be things in earth, or things in heaven.</p>
               <p rend="small">20. And having accepted his Sacrifice on the Croſs for a general Attonement and Propitiation, by him to reconcile the guilty, ſinful, and curſed World to him, ſo far as that their Guilt and Enmity ſhould not hinder the Tenders of Free Mercy and Salvation to <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> nor keep his Elect and Faithful Flock from that Heavenly Glory, where Angels and Saints ſhall be One Bleſſed Society, united in Love to God and each other.</p>
               <p n="21">21. And you that were ſometimes aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled,</p>
               <p rend="small">21. And you, who were not onely, as all others, originally guilty, as the Seed of <hi>Adam,</hi> but alſo of the Race and Society of <hi>Gentiles,</hi> by your wicked Works eſtranged from God, and out of the way of his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Grace, and Enemies to it and him, yet now hath he reconciled by Chriſt, and taken you for his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>

                  <hi>Note,</hi> That how true ſoever it be, that ſound Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ſhall be finally juſtified in Judgment, and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, the Promiſe giveth them Right to it but on Condition of Perſeverance; and God uſeth Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Promiſes to engage us rationally to our Duty, and as a Means to accompliſh his Abſolute Decrees.</p>

               <p rend="small">24. And I rejoyce that God honoureth me to ſuffer for his Church in ſo excellent a Work: For it is by the Croſs, or Suffering, that God will bring the Church to Glory: And as Chriſt hath perfectly done his own part, as the onely Propitiating Sacrifice; ſo I, with the reſt of his Members, muſt undergo and make up the reſt, even for the ſame Churches ſake for which he died, though not as a Mediator, to reconcile God and Man, as he was.</p>

Though it be not diſcerned by carnal Men, who ſearch more after other Knowledge in the World, the depth, excellency, and benefit of all true Wiſdom and Knowledge, are compriſed in the Knowledge of God manifeſted in Chriſt: This is the true Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, in compariſon of which, all other is Vanity and Folly.</p>

               <p rend="small">2, 3. We thankfully remember your working Faith, your laborious Love, and patient Hope in Chriſt, which is all ſeen and accepted by God our Father.</p>
               <p n="4">4, 5. Knowing, brethren beloved, your election of God. For our goſpel came not unto you in word onely, but alſo in power, and in the holy Ghoſt, and in much aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; as ye know what manner of men we were among you for your ſake.</p>
               <p rend="small">4, 5. For I was aſſured, that God had freely elected you to be honoured as a Church of Chriſt, in that he ſent me particularly to you, and that with Power of Miracles, and pouring out of the Holy Ghoſt, he confirmed my Miniſtry, and cauſed me to fulfil it, as your Experience telleth you.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And ye became followers of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the holy Ghoſt:</p>
               <p rend="small">6. And becauſe he bleſſed all with ſuch Succeſs that you obeyed our Word, and were converted to God, receiving the Word in the trial of ſharp Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Oppoſition, and yet with Joy, and the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p n="7">7. So that ye were enſamples to all that believe in Macedonia and Achaia.</p>
               <p rend="small">7. So that your Example tended to the happy imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of all that now believe in <hi>Macedonia</hi> and <hi>Achaia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. For from you ſounded out the word of the Lord, not onely in Macedonia and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaia, but alſo in every place your faith to God-ward is ſpread abroad, ſo that we need not to ſpeak any thing.</p>
               <p rend="small">8. For from you the Word of God ſpread abroad, even in many other Countries it is known; ſo that I need not tell it them, to your praiſe, and their imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
               <p n="9">9. For they themſelves ſhew of us, what manner of entring in we had unto you, and how ye turned to God from Idols, to ſerve the living and true God,</p>
               <p rend="small">9. They tell abroad themſelves, what Succeſs we had in your Converſion from Idolatry to the true God.</p>

               <p n="1">1. FOr your ſelves, brethren, know our entrance in unto you, that it was not in vain.</p>
               <p rend="small">1. For you are my Witneſſes, that I came not to you in deceit, on any falſe deſign or manner.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But even after that we had ſuffered before, and were ſhamefully entreated, as ye know at Philippi, we were bold in our God to ſpeak unto you the goſpel of God with much contention.</p>
               <p rend="small">3. But our ſhameful uſage at <hi>Philippi</hi> did not diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage us; but our truſt in our God did embolden us to preach his Goſpel to you, though in a conflict of great oppoſition.</p>
               <p n="3">3. For our exhortation was not of deceit, nor of uncleanneſs, nor in guile: 4. But as we were allowed of God to be put in truſt with the goſpel, even ſo we ſpeak, not as pleaſing men, but God, which trieth our hearts.</p>
               <p rend="small">3, 4. For I came not to you to deceive you into Errour, nor to plead for fleſhly Luſts, nor craſtily to make advantage of you to our gain: But as God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved and choſe me to be put in truſt with the Preaching of the Goſpel, I do it to pleaſe him who trieth our Hearts, and not to pleaſe the Humours and Luſts of Men.</p>
               <p n="5">5. For neither at any time uſed we flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering words, as ye know, nor a cloke of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs; God is witneſs.</p>
               <p rend="small">5. For you your ſelves know, that I flattered you not, nor indulged fleſhly Pleaſures; and God know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that I made not the Goſpel a Cloak to hide any covetous Deſign.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Nor of men ſought we glory, neither of you, nor yet of others, when we might have been burdenſom, as the apoſtles of Chriſt.</p>
               <p rend="small">6. Nor did I preach up my ſelf, for Vain-glory (Power or Profit), neither with you, or any others; though as Chriſts Apoſtle I might have pleaded my Power, and demanded Maintenance.</p>
               <p n="7">7. But we were gentle among you, even as a nurſe cheriſheth her children:</p>
               <p rend="small">7. But we ſought not our Gain and Glory, but your Good; and that with all the love and tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to you, as a Nurſe cheriſheth her Children, in ſelf-denial.</p>
               <p n="8">8. So being affectionately deſirous of you, we were willing to have imparted unto you, not the goſpel of God onely, but alſo our own ſouls, becauſe ye were dear unto us.</p>
               <p rend="small">8. So my ſtrong Love to you made me not onely willingly to preach the Goſpel to you, (without any ſelfiſh, proud, or covetous deſign) but you are ſo dear to me, that I think not my Life too dear for you.</p>
               <p n="9">9. For ye remember, brethren, our labour and travel: for labouring night and day, becauſe we would not be chargeable unto any of you, we preached unto you the goſpel of God.</p>
               <p rend="small">9. Ye cannot but remember my great Toil and Labour, how working at my Trade Night and Day, becauſe I would not be chargeable to any of you, I preached the Goſpel to you freely.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Ye are witneſſes, and God alſo, how holily, and juſtly, and unblameably we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved our ſelves among you that believe.</p>
               <p rend="small">10. I appeal to your ſelves, and to God, as Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, that our Behaviour with you was holy, juſt, and blameleſs.</p>
               <p n="11">11. As you know how we exhorted and comforted, and charged every one of you (as a father doth his children) 12. That ye would walk worthy of God, who hath called you unto his kingdom and glory.</p>
               <p rend="small">11, 12. As you know how tenderly I exhorted, and comforted, and charged not onely the Aſſemblies, but every one that I could ſpeak to, even as a Father will do to every Child; that now you are Chriſtians, you will live as is ſuitable to the God you ſerve, and the Kingdom and Glory to which he hath called you.</p>
               <p n="13">13. For this cauſe alſo thank we God without ceaſing, becauſe when ye received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received it not as the word of men, but (as it is in truth) the word of God, which effectually worketh alſo in you that believe.</p>
               <p rend="small">13. And it is the matter of our unceſſant thanks to God, that you received not the Goſpel as Mens Word, with a meer Humane Faith and Obedience; but as Gods Word, with a Divine: which it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to be, by the powerful efficacy of it on your ſelves, who are true Believers.</p>
               <p n="14">14. For ye, brethren, became followers of the churches of God, which in Judea are in Chriſt Jeſus: for ye alſo have ſuffered like things of your own countrymen, even as they have of the Jews.</p>
               <p rend="small">14. Ye follow the Churches in <hi>Judea,</hi> in ſuffering by your own Neighbours, as well as in the ſame Faith.</p>

               <p n="15">15. Who both killed the Lord Jeſus, and their own prophets, and have perſecuted us; and they pleaſe not God, and are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to all men: 16. Forbidding us to ſpeak to the Gentiles, that they might be ſaved, to fill up their ſins alway: for the wrath is come upon them to the uttermoſt.</p>
               <p rend="small">15, 16. <hi>Note,</hi> 1. That the Carnal Church hath been more perſecuting and bloody than the Heathens.</p>
               <p rend="small">2. That Chriſt himſelf ſeemed not to them good enough to live, or to be endured among them; but was murdered as a Traytor and Blaſphemer, by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Law and Juſtice. And Prophets and Apoſtles had the like uſage.</p>
               <p rend="small">3. That bloody Perſecution oft goeth with the Carnal Church for a great Duty.</p>
               <p rend="small">4. That God is not pleaſed with the Perſecutors of his Servants, though they do it as to pleaſe him.</p>
               <p rend="small">5. That malignant Perſecutors are oft ſo mad as to be contrary to all Men, or engage themſelves againſt the common Intereſt of Mankind, that they may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute the Faithful.</p>
               <p rend="small">6. It is the ſilencing of the beſt Preachers of the Goſpel, which hath the heat of their malignant Zeal.</p>
               <p rend="small">7. It is that Preaching which would ſave Souls, which they forbid: And becauſe this Preaching is the Means to ſave Souls, it is that Satan aimeth his Militia againſt it.</p>
               <p rend="small">8. Perſecuting and ſilencing Faithful Preachers, is the way to fill up the Sins of the malignant Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
               <p rend="small">9. God uſeth not to bring the utmoſt Wrath on Men, till they have filled up their Sins.</p>
               <p rend="small">10. How long ſoever they proſper, Wrath will come at laſt to the uttermoſt on malignant Sinners and Perſecutors of the faithful Preachers of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel.</p>
               <p n="17">17. But we, brethren, being taken from you for a ſhort time, in preſence, not in heart, endeavoured the more abundantly to ſee your face with great deſire.</p>
               <p rend="small">17. But our conſtrained abſence from you, (in Perſon, not in Heart) made us the more earneſtly deſire to ſee you.</p>
               <p n="18">18. Wherefore we would have come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you (even I Paul) once and again, but Satan hindred us.</p>

               <p n="19">19. For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoycing? are not even ye in the preſence of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? 20. For ye are our glory and joy.</p>
               <p rend="small">19, 20. For what is that Hope, and Joy, and Crown, for which I labour ſo hard, and ſuffer ſo much?

               <p n="1">1. BUt of the times and ſeaſons, bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, ye have no need that I write
<pb facs="tcp:66325:223"/>
unto you. 2. For your ſelves know perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that the day of the Lord ſo cometh as a thief in the night.</p>
               <p rend="small">1, 2. But to write to you of the particular time of Chriſts coming, I ſuppoſe you expect not; for you have been told, that he cometh as a Thief in the Night, unexpected, Men not foreknowing when.</p>
               <p n="3">3. For when they ſhall ſay, Peace and ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; then ſudden deſtruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they ſhall not eſcape.</p>
               <p rend="small">3. So much muſt the time be unknown, that it will ſurpriſe them with ſudden unavoidable Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on when they moſt preſume that all is well with them, and ſafe.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But ye, brethren, are not in darkneſs, that that day ſhould overtake you as a thief. 5. Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkneſs.</p>
               <p rend="small">4, 5. But though you know not the time, it will not ſo ſurpriſe you, as Thieves do Men aſleep in the Night: For ye are all in the Day-light; and not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prepared, in a ſtate of Darkneſs.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Therefore let us not ſleep as do others; but let us watch and be ſober.</p>
               <p rend="small">6. Therefore let this remember you to avoid the careleſs Preſumption, the Vices and unprepared ſtate of the ſleepy World; and to live as awake, and in ſobriety.</p>
               <p n="7">7. For they that ſleep, ſleep in the night; and they that be drunken, are drunken in the night.</p>
               <p rend="small">7. For the Night is the time of ſleep, and to hide the ſhame of Drunkenneſs by Darkneſs.</p>
               <p n="8">8. But let us who are of the day, be ſober, putting on the breſtplate of faith and love, and for an helmet, the hope of ſalvation.</p>
               <p rend="small">8. But let us, whom God hath brought out of Darkneſs into the Chriſtian Light, live ſoberly, wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Faith and Love as Soldiers do a Breaſtplate, and the Hope of Salvation as they do an Helmet, to ſave Heart and Head from all Aſſaults.</p>
               <p n="9">9. For God hath not appointed us to wrath; but to obtain ſalvation by our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p rend="small">9. For it is not us, that are his faithful Servants, but his rebellious Enemies, whom God hath appointed to Wrath; but us he appointeth to obtain Salvation by Chriſt.</p>

               <p rend="small">10. Who died for us, that whether we wake or ſleep in Body, live or die, we ſhould live with him.</p>

               <p rend="small">11. Therefore continue as you do to aſſemble and comfort your ſelves together with theſe Hopes, and to edifie one another thereby.</p>

               <p n="12">12. And we beſeech you, brethren, to know them which labour among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admoniſh you; 13. And to eſteem them very highly in love for their works ſake. <hi>And</hi> be at peace a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong your ſelves.</p>

               <p rend="small">5. That it is for their Works ſake that this is due to them, and therefore not to thoſe that work not.</p>

               <p rend="small">7. Due Love and Reſpect between the Paſtors and the Flock, and being at peace among themſelves, are the way to eſtabliſh a Church in a proſperous ſtate.</p>

               <p n="1">1. NOw, we beſeech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and by our gathering together unto him, 2. That ye be not ſoon ſhaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by ſpirit, nor by word, nor by letter, as from us, as that the day of Chriſt is at hand.</p>
               <p rend="small">1, 2. I vehemently beſeech you, that no Pretence either of Spirit, Word, or Apoſtolical Letter, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade you that Chriſts Coming is near at hand, and ſo trouble you, and your Faith be ſhaken when that's diſappointed.</p>
               <p rend="small">
                  <hi>Note further,</hi> That it's more than the Deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> that is here meant; For it will be the Churches <hi>gathering together</hi> to Chriſt at his coming. 2. And it neither agreeth with the following long Perſecutions of the Church by the Heathens, nor with <hi>Paul</hi>'s uſual Pity to the <hi>Jews,</hi> thus to inſult in their Deſtruction, as if it brought a Felicity to the Church like Heaven it ſelf.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day ſhall not come, except there come a falling away firſt, and that man of ſin be revealed, the ſon of perdition: 4. Who oppoſeth and exalteth himſelf above all that is called God, or that is worſhipped; ſo that he as God ſitteth in the temple of God, ſhewing himſelf that he is God.</p>
               <p rend="small">3. It is dangerous deceit for any to perſuade you, that the Day of Chriſt is at hand: for there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things that muſt firſt come to paſs: There muſt firſt be a falling away of many from the Faith; and that notable Man of Sin muſt appear, who is to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed. 4. Who arrogantly oppoſeth true Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and exalteth himſelf above all, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5, 6, 7. Remember ye not, that when I was yet with you, I told you theſe things? And now ye know what withholdeth, that he might be revealed in his time. For the myſtery of iniquity doth already work: one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he who now letteth will let, until he be taken out of the way. 8. And then ſhall that wicked be revealed, whom the Lord ſhall conſume with the ſpirit of his mouth, and ſhall deſtroy with the brightneſs of his coming: 9. Even him whoſe coming is after the working of Satan, with all pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and ſigns, and lying wonders, 10. And with all deceiveableneſs of unrighteouſneſs, in them that periſh; becauſe they received not the love of the truth, that they might be ſaved. 11. And for this cauſe God ſhall ſend them ſtrong deluſion, that they ſhould believe a lie: 12. That they all might be damned, who believed not the truth, but had pleaſure in unrighteouſneſs.</p>
               <p rend="small">
                  <hi>Note,</hi> 1. That Forewarning ſhould be Forearming. 2. Both the riſe and fall of Sin and Sinners muſt have their proper Seaſons: Gods delays are but ſtaying till the due time. 3. Removing Impediments is the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partory work for future events. 4. This great Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of Chriſt is a Man Lawleſs, and made up of Wickedneſs. 5. He muſt be firſt revealed, and then conſumed, even by his Word, Spirit, and Coming. 5. Satan will promote this Enemy of Chriſt, with Power, Signs, and lying Wonders, and Deceivableneſs of Unrighteouſneſs. 6. Not receiving the Love of the Truth of Goſpel, nor heartily believing it, but taking pleaſure in Unrighteouſneſs, prepare Men for damning Deluſions. 7. God is ſaid to ſend them ſuch Deluſions, by penal Deſertions and Permiſſions.</p>

                  <hi>Readers,</hi> I dare not take on me to teach you that as true, which I know not my ſelf; nor yet to pretend that I know more than I do. I confeſs, that I am un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain who it is that <hi>Paul</hi> here deſcribeth: And meerly to know what other Men ſay of it, is no ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to me, eſpecially when they ſo greatly differ as they do.</p>
               <p rend="small">1. Moſt of the Fathers and Papiſts think, that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt here deſcribed is ſome odious Falſe-Chriſt, who is yet to come before the End of the World. I have much to ſay againſt that Opinion.</p>
               <p rend="small">2. <hi>Grotius</hi> thought that this Chapter ſpeaks of the Emperour <hi>Caius Caligula</hi> chiefly, and partly of <hi>Simon Magus.</hi> So much may be ſaid againſt that, as that his Follower Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> rejecteth it.</p>
               <p rend="small">3. Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> thinks it ſpeaketh onely of <hi>Simon Magus.</hi> I cannot believe that: 1. Becauſe really this <hi>Simon</hi> was no ſuch conſiderable formidable Perſon as he deſcribeth him. The few Scraps of Hiſtory of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> recited by him, are very dubious. No great or publick Hiſtory of thoſe Times mention him. He was affrighted into Submiſſion and Supplication to <hi>Peter, Acts</hi> 8. He was not thought worthy the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming after, in all the ſharp Charges againſt Hereticks

in the Epiſtles. The Judaizers are reproved; the Conciſion called Dogs; the Troublers <hi>Paul</hi> wiſheth cut off; the <hi>Nicolaitans</hi> named; and the Woman <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zebel,</hi> and many Antichriſts, mentioned by <hi>John</hi>; the groſſer ſort of Hereticks ſmartly deſcribed, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Jude: John</hi> forbids us to bid them Good-ſpeed: <hi>Paul</hi> bids Men avoid them as ſelf-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned: The <hi>Revelation</hi> ſpeaketh yet more fully. And none of them all mention <hi>Simon</hi> as the God and Ringleader of them.

If they were not then known to be his Off-ſpring, it ſeems theſe Hereſies had other Fathers before him, more noted and followed. 2. <hi>Simon</hi> was revealed before the writing of this Epiſtle, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. and the Hereſies before too common. 3. There were ſeven or eight other Hereſies deſcribed by <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> as early as the <hi>Simonians</hi> and <hi>Gnoſticks,</hi> and as bad. 4. Sure <hi>Gnoſticiſm</hi> was not then an unrevealed Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, if it be mentioned as oft as the Doctor thinketh. 5. And through Gods Mercy the <hi>falling away firſt</hi> was comparatively but of few, and not of ſo great a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Churches or Chriſtians, as was a ſtop to their Expectation of the coming of Chriſt. It is not no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in <hi>Acts</hi> 8. that the <hi>Samaritans</hi> were ſeduced by him after they believed. If it were true, that they, and ſome at <hi>Rome</hi> were, what's that to all the Churches? 6. It is above Sixteen hundred years ſince <hi>Simon</hi> was revealed, and yet Chriſt is not come; How then is that made an Occaſion of Mens delayed Expectation? 7. That Chriſts coming<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſignified but the Deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> is before ſhewed to be very improbable, and fullier might be. How many hot Perſecutions of Chriſtians after that, do all Church-Hiſtories de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe, in another manner than <hi>Simon</hi>'s Pranks? And what could the <hi>Jews</hi> do through all the Empire, being contemned Vagabonds, but by way of Rabble tumult, which the <hi>Roman</hi> Power reſtrained? 8. And it ſeemeth meer violence to the Text, to make [<hi>him that withholdeth,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>], to ſignifie not [<hi>him,</hi>] but [<hi>that thing</hi>] which withholdeth, even the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians not yet ſeparating from the Jews. For, 1. There was no ſet time of ſeparation: <hi>Paul</hi> did it long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apoſtles that converſed with them in <hi>Judea</hi>; and when they did, none know. And <hi>Paul</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew from them as Obſtinacy gave him cauſe, in one Place ſooner than in others; and never ſo far, but that he laboured for their Converſion. Nor were any ſuch direful Perſecutions an Effect of that Separation, as far as juſt Hiſtory informeth us: It was the ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered Jews that were the Rudiments of moſt of the Chriſtian Churches in the Empire, to whom the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, were added. And this Doctor himſelf oft aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, That <hi>Rome, Alexandria, Antioch,</hi> and ſuch other great Cities, had two Biſhops, and two Churches, one of the Jews, and one of the Gentiles. And the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian <hi>Jews</hi> did not ſeparate from their Countrymen of a long time.</p>
               <p rend="small">That which the Apoſtle mentioneth, the whole Catholick Church ſeemeth to be concerned in where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the little Pranks of <hi>Simon Magus</hi> were like <hi>John of Leyden</hi>'s, and <hi>Knipperdolling</hi>'s, and <hi>James Naylor</hi>'s, which had a few contemned Followers, in a few Towns, a little while, and then ended in Shame: Like the Boys Squibs, compared to a War.</p>
               <p rend="small">8. And what Myſtery was there in ſo groſs Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, as for <hi>Simon</hi> to call himſelf God the Father, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> any more than to have ſeen <hi>Hacket</hi> or a Bedlam rave?</p>
               <p rend="small">9. And if ſuch <hi>wonders of deceit</hi> had been wrought by him, as is here mentioned, as ſhould delude thoſe that received not the Love of the Truth to Salvation, Hiſtory would have fullier recorded his Miracles, and this Succeſs: Even on <hi>All them</hi> that believed not the Truth, but had pleaſure in Unrighteouſneſs.</p>
               <p rend="small">4. Some think that <hi>Paul</hi> here ſpeaketh of a Sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Ringleader of the <hi>Jews,</hi> that drew them into Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, to their deſtruction; and that the fear of ſome <hi>Roman</hi> Governour was it that for a time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained him. But this Opinion few follow.</p>
               <p rend="small">5. <hi>Lyra</hi> and ſome other Papiſts think, that it was <hi>Mahomet</hi> that was this great Deceiver, and the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, and the Empire that withheld. His Reaſons are rendred in his Annotations on the <hi>Revelations,</hi> and on this Text: And <hi>Zanchy</hi> was much of the ſame mind, though he thought the Pope was a kind of ſecond Antichriſt.</p>
               <p rend="small">6. But the far greateſt number of Proteſtants think, that it is the Pope that is here ſpoken of, as the <hi>Man of Sin,</hi> and <hi>Son of Perdition, &amp;c.</hi> and that it is the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire that withheld his Revelation: But ſome few think that it was the Godly Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> that for ſome Ages poſſeſt that Seat, (and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny were Martyrs) that withheld this Revelation of Antichriſt, till they were taken away by Death: For Men would not believe that the Succeſſours of ſo good Men could be Antichriſt.

But whether it be he that this Text meaneth, or thoſe applied to him in the Revelation, I have not skill enough to be ſure, or very confident. And, 3. I think a Chriſtian may be very ſafe without underſtanding theſe obſcure Texts: I long to know <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> better, more than to know <hi>Antichriſt</hi>: His name is not in the Creed, nor is it an Article of the ancient neceſſary Faith to know who he is; ſo we know the Falſe Doctrines and Practices which we muſt avoid. Perhaps, thoſe that have more throughly ſtudied theſe Texts may know more; (though I muſt ſay, that their great diſagreement of Opinion diſcourageth my hopes of full underſtanding them). I think it my duty to

               <p rend="small">If you ſay, Why were theſe Prophecies written, if not to be underſtood? I anſwer, To be underſtood by them that can, and not to be Expounded by them that cannot.

For the beginnings of Antichriſtianity are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly and myſteriouſly already working, which will bring him forth in time, even the Pride and Ambition of Miniſters ſeeking Superiority, and the Peoples exceſs of Factious Reſpects to ſome above others, and falling into Sects and Hereſies in fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing them.

Even that Pope, with his <hi>Roman</hi> Church of Papiſts, whoſe coming to the Papacy is after that way of working, by force, and cheats, and feigned Miracles, which Satan teacheth and giveth them to ſeduce the Chriſtian World. 10.

               <p n="6">6. Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that ye withdraw your ſelves from every brother that walketh diſorderly, and not after the tradition which he received of us.</p>
               <p rend="small">6. And this is one of the Commands which in the name of Chriſt I have to deliver you, to preſerve you from revolting, <hi>viz,</hi> to keep your Society clean from Scandal, by avoiding the familiar company of every one profeſſing Chriſtianity, who liveth diſorderly, and not according to the Law of Chriſt which we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to him.</p>
               <p rend="small">
                  <hi>Note,</hi> 1. That there is a degree of avoiding Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity with a diſorderly Chriſtian, to ſhame him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Repentance, and to preſerve our ſelves, and the Honour of Chriſtianity, which is ſhort of a publick Declarative, Excommunication, and caſting out of the Church. It is juſtly called <hi>Suſpenſion,</hi> becauſe a Man is not to be Excommunicate till he be proved obſtinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Impenitent: But a Man that is guilty of a notorious ſcandalous ſin, may be ſuſpended while he is under try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al whether he will repent or not.</p>
               <p rend="small">2. <hi>Note,</hi> That this Command of withdrawing from the diſorderly, doth not require that we withdraw from the Church when ſuch intrude, or are there permitted. No more than you muſt forſake your own Houſe and Family if he intrude: You have right and command to be there, tho he have no right.</p>
               <p rend="small">3. Nor doth it make all to be of equal power in Church Matters, not bind any to go beyond his Power. 1. Of Mans Capacity for Publick Church Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Paſtors are Judges: And if they be negligent, its their ſin, which will not allow Private Men to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake the Publick Communion, till the Church ſo far forſake God as to be forſaken by him. 2. But Private Familiarity is in Private Mens Power, where they may diſcountenance the Scandalous by withdrawing from them.</p>
               <p n="7">7. For your ſelves know how ye ought to follow us: for we behaved not our ſelves diſorderly among you, 8. Neither did we eat any mans bread for nought; but wrought with labour and travel night and day, that we might not be chargeable to any of you:</p>
               <p rend="small">7, 8. You know what our Example was, that ought to be imitated: I did not live idly, and look that the Church ſhould maintain me, nor baſely hang on any, or needleſly burden them; nor take their Bread which I paid not for: but while I taught you
<pb facs="tcp:66325:227"/>
I laboured and toiled at my Trade that I might be chargeable to none of you.</p>

               <p rend="small">10. <hi>Note,</hi> Poor Men that will not work when they can, do forfeit the Bread of Charity from Men; but Rich Men that live idly do by that ſin forfeit their Food, (and more, even their lives and Souls) to God; but Men may not therefore take it from them.</p>
               <p n="11">11. For we hear that there are ſome which walk among you diſorderly, working not at all, but are buſie-bodies.</p>

               <p rend="small">12. To live on the labours or coſt of others, through baſe, indulging fleſhly eaſe, or unprofitable trifling, is ſo great a ſin, that I do command you, and exhort you, by the authority of Chriſt, and as you will obey him, that you avoid it, and that you quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and willingly get your own living by ſome profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table labour, and eat not other Mens Bread, but your own, and that not the Bread of Idleneſs.</p>

A Biſhop, as Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> maintaineth, had then but one Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, and no Subject-Presbyter under him. He certainly had no Power of the Sword to force Men.

And no doubt <hi>Epheſus</hi> had ſuch, (ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Timothy,</hi> or others.) If it be Archbiſhops that are made the matter of this Doubt, it's certain, that an Archbiſhop had no Power of the Sword, nor was a Biſhop to any but conſenting Voluntiers, and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed onely on <hi>Conſcience,</hi> and not immediately on <hi>Body</hi> or <hi>Purſe.</hi> And I believe that <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> and the Apoſtles, were ſo far Archbiſhops, as that they had by Office the Care of gathering many Churches, and then taking care of their Preſervation and Increaſe, by urging the Doctrine and Commands of Chriſt, and Ordaining Biſhops over particular Churches <hi>(Epiſcopos gregis)</hi> by their own and the Flocks conſent, and not otherwiſe; and then exhorting ſuch Paſtors and Churches on juſt occaſions to do their Duties. And who can be againſt ſuch Archbiſhops.</p>
               <p rend="small">But ſome that now feign the Idea of a Biſhop to be one that hath many ſcore or Hundred Churches under him, which have no Biſhop but himſelf, and one that is ſet over them without their conſent, and that ruleth them by force, of the adjoyned Sword, Impriſonment, or Ruine, are ready to Dream that <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> were ſuch Biſhops.

               <p n="3">3. For this is good and acceptable in the ſight of God our Saviour: 4. Who will have all men to be ſaved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.</p>
               <p rend="small">3, 4. For this is agreeable to the great Mercy ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted in Mans Redemption by Jeſus Chriſt, who by his Death, and Covenant of Grace, and Preaching, hath ſhewed us how willing he is that all Men ſhould be ſaved, and come to the knowledge of his Goſpel.</p>
               <p rend="small">
                  <hi>Note,</hi> 1. That while we obediently pray as God commandeth us, we may confidently expect Gods acceptance. 2. An extenſive Charity rendreth us like Chriſt. 3. It is not onely <hi>all ſorts of men</hi> that Chriſt would have to be ſaved; but he willeth the Salvation of all Men in general, ſo far as to make a Sacrifice ſufficient for all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if all will believe; and to make an Act of Oblivion, or general Pardon, and Gift of Life to all, on Condition of Acceptance; and to ſend his Meſſengers promiſcuouſly to all, with the Word of Reconciliation, to beſeech them to be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to God. What Chriſt giveth to all, he willeth and purchaſed for all: But he giveth to all a Pardon, and Right to Life, on Condition of Acceptance: Therefore he is ſo far willing of their Salvation.</p>
               <p n="5">5. For there is one God, and one media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour between God and men, the man Chriſt Jeſus; 6. Who gave himſelf a ranſom for all, to be teſtified in due time.</p>

For it muſt move us to pray for all, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with this Will of God, that would have all Men ſaved; becauſe there is One God who is good to all, and One Mediatour between God and Mankind, who took on him the Common Nature of all Men, and gave himſelf a Ranſom for all, revealed in the Seaſon appointed of God, (or to be preached to all in due time, as God pleaſeth.)</p>
               <p rend="small">
                  <hi>Note,</hi> The Controverſie about Univerſal Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, too hotly agitated by <hi>Beza, Piſcater,</hi> and others, on one ſide, and by many on the other, I have fully handled in my <hi>Catholick Theologie,</hi> and <hi>Methodus Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giae</hi>; and it needs no more than as aforeſaid: 1. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is damned, it is not becauſe no Ranſom was made for him, or becauſe it was not ſufficient for him. 2. By Gods <hi>Will</hi> to <hi>ſave all,</hi> is meant the Effects of his Will that have a tendency to their Salvation. 3. It is notorious, that God hath made an Univerſal Act of Grace or Oblivion, giving Pardon of all Sin, and Right to Life in Chriſt, to all Men, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, on Condition of Believing-acceptance; and hath commiſſioned his Miniſters to offer this Gift to all Men, to the utmoſt of their power, and entreat them to accept it; and doth by many Mercies inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate to them, that he uſeth them not according to the meer violated Law of Innocency, but on Terms of Grace. 4. Few Chriſtians have the face to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that this Univerſal Conditional Pardon and Gift (or Law of Grace) is no Fruit of the Death of Chriſt. 5. If therefore this Act of Pardon was purchaſed by Chriſt, and given to all, no modeſt Face can deny, that he ſo far died for all, as to purchaſe for them all that he actually giveth them. 6. It is uſual to ſay that we give a Man a Benefit, (<hi>e. g.</hi> Life to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned Malefactor) if it be given him on the fair Condition of his Acceptance, and brought to his own Will, and he intreated to receive it. 7. If any Wrangler ſay, that this is unfit Language, (to ſay, He is willing that Men ſhall be ſaved, who offereth them Salvation freely, unleſs he alſo make them wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling:) Let him confeſs, that it is but the <hi>Name</hi> that he denieth, and none of the Gifts in queſtion. 8. And be it known, that Unwillingneſs cometh not from a Phyſical Impoſſibility, through the want of Natural Faculties, (as it is with Brutes) but from a voluntary Pravity, which aggravateth the Sin. 9. And the mutable Will of Man is to be changed by Reaſon: And God giveth Men Reaſons in their kind ſufficient to perſuade them to accept of Chriſt and
<pb facs="tcp:66325:229"/>
Life. 10. And laſtly, No Man can ſay, that <hi>Adam</hi> when he fell had not Grace enough to make him <hi>Able</hi> to have ſtood, which he might have uſed, and ſhould have done, to his actual ſtanding: No<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, that God never giveth ſuch a <hi>power to believe</hi> (or at leaſt to come nearer the State of a true Believer) to many that might bring it into Act, and do not. This much is enough to end this Controverſie with modeſt Wits.</p>

                  <hi>Note,</hi> That the Ceremony of Lifting up the Hands in Prayer, (which was an Act of Corporal ſecondary Worſhip) is lawful, and fit where Cuſtom maketh it ſo, and yet is not neceſſary by Inſtitution; as Kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alſo is.</p>

               <p rend="small">11. Let them be Learners, rather than Teachers; and let them uſe Silence and humble Subjection, and not be over-talkative and maſterly; ſpecially ſilent in the Church.</p>

                  <hi>Note,</hi> 1. That <hi>Paul</hi> forbiddeth not Women to teach their Children or Servants, or the elder Women to teach the younger. 2.

               <p rend="small">1. <hi>Note,</hi> 1. It is Gods <hi>calling</hi> Will, and not onely his <hi>permitting</hi> Will, which muſt warrant any to aſſume the Sacred Miniſtry, and prove him a true Miniſter of Chriſt.</p>
               <p rend="small">2. The Promiſe of Life in Chriſt, muſt have Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters to proclaim it, and to preach this is their Work.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I thank God, whom I ſerve from my forefathers with pure conſcience, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ceaſing I have remembrance of thee in my prayers night and day:</p>
               <p rend="small">3. <hi>Note,</hi> It ſeemeth ſtrange, that a Perſecutor, and the chief of Sinners, ſhould ſay, That from his Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers he ſerved God with pure Conſcience; and to the High Prieſt, That he had lived in all good Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to that day. <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Some think he meaneth, [Since I was a Chriſtian, I have ſerved God ſincerely, as <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> did.] Others think he meaneth, [Not onely ſince my Converſion, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I deſigned onely to ſerve God; and though through ignorance I miſtook the <hi>Matter,</hi> I did it in zeal to pleaſe God, and faithfully obeyed my Conſcience.] Which ever be the Senſe, there is no Doctrinal Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence dependeth on the Controverſie.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Greatly deſiring to ſee thee, being mindful of thy tears, that I may be filled with joy: 5. When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt firſt in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and I am perſwaded that in thee alſo.</p>
               <p rend="small">4, 5. <hi>Note,</hi> 1. Though we muſt love all Chriſtians with a ſpecial Love, yet with great difference, as they differ. Choice, Chriſtians, and very loving Friends, muſt be loved above the reſt.</p>
               <p rend="small">2. The more unfeigned and free from Hypocriſie, in Faith and Godlineſs he appears to be, the more amiable is that Chriſtian.</p>
               <p rend="small">3. God often bleſſeth the Labours and Examples of Godly Women, to raiſe up excellent Inſtruments in his Church.</p>
               <p rend="small">4. It rendreth a good Chriſtian more amiable and honourable, to be the Off-ſpring of Godly Parents.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Wherefore I put thee in remembrance, that thou ſtir up the gift of God, which is in thee by the putting on of my hands.</p>
               <p rend="small">6. <hi>Note,</hi> 1. Gods Spiritual Gifts muſt be uſed by our own ſtirring them up.</p>
               <p rend="small">2. It is here controverted, 1. Whether it be the Gift of the Miniſtry, and its proper Neceſſaries, that is here meant, or the foregoing Gift of the Holy Ghoſt? 2. Whether it be meant of <hi>Paul</hi>'s laying on his Hands for the former, or the latter?</p>
               <p rend="small">To theſe, it may ſuffice us to know, 1. That <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi> was converted by <hi>Paul</hi>; and then it was uſual for Converts to receive the Holy Ghoſt for ſome wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Gifts, by the Laying on of the Apoſtles Hands: And it is not to be doubted, but ſo did <hi>Timothy,</hi> long before his Ordination to the Miniſtry. And who was ſo likely to do this as <hi>Paul</hi>? 2. It's not to be doubted, but <hi>Timothy,</hi> after this, had Impoſition of Hands at his Ordination. 3. It is certain, that it was then by the Hands of the Presbytery. 4. It is probable, that <hi>Paul</hi> was one of them, and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Therefore, as the next Verſe ſheweth, that he ſpeaketh of the Spirit or Gift of Sanctification, not proper to Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters; ſo it is certain, that <hi>Paul</hi> meant this, but not improbable that he meant the other alſo, but compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended both.</p>
               <p n="7">7. For God hath not given us the ſpirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a ſound mind.</p>
               <p rend="small">7. For though <hi>Jews</hi> are under the Spirit of Legal Fear and Bondage, and Unbelievers have a cowardly Fear of Men, this is not the Spirit given us by the Goſpel; but it is the ſanctifying of the three great Faculties of the Soul, the <hi>Executive Faculty</hi> by Holy <hi>Power,</hi> the <hi>Will</hi> by Holy <hi>Love,</hi> and the <hi>Intellect</hi> by ſound and ſober <hi>Judgment</hi>: This is the Spirit of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Be not thou therefore aſhamed of the teſtimony of our Lord, nor of me his priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the goſpel, according to the power of God;</p>
               <p rend="small">8. Be not therefore aſhamed of preaching and owning the Goſpel, or of any Suffering that this will bring, nor of me, who am Chriſts Priſoner, as ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering for his Work: But whatever hard uſage Men

               <p n="9">9. Who hath ſaved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpoſe and grace which was given us in Chriſt Jeſus, before the world began.</p>
               <p rend="small">9. Who hath ſaved us from our ſervitude to ſin and Satan, and called us out of the World to be a Holy People, ſeparated to himſelf; not becauſe by our Works we were a more Deſerving People before than others, but according to his own Purpoſe and Gracious <hi>Decree</hi> of ſaving us by Chriſt which he had for us before the World or Ages began.</p>

               <p rend="small">
                  <hi>Note</hi>; The Church hath but one Faith (or Creed) common in the Eſſentials to every Chriſtian.</p>
               <p n="5">5. For this cauſe left I thee in Crete, that thou ſhouldeſt ſet in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed thee.</p>
               <p rend="small">5 <hi>Note,</hi> 1. That <hi>Titus</hi> is not ſaid to be ſettled in <hi>Crete</hi> as their fixed Biſhop, but left there in his Travels, to ſettle fixed Biſhops there. The Scriptures tell us that <hi>Timothy</hi> &amp; <hi>Titus</hi> were Itinerant Evangeliſts, that went about where <hi>Paul</hi> ſent them to plant and ſettle Churches. But the plain truth is, that Apoſtles, and ſuch Evangeliſts as theſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they came, had as great Authority as any meer Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, and more; and that they ſtayed in ſome Countrys longer than in others, to ſettle the Churches; and that the Churches after their Age thought it an honour to be their Charge, and ſo called them their Biſhops. In which ſenſe one Apoſtle might have twenty or forty Biſhopricks, as he planted and ſettled ſo many Churches: But none of them were Biſhops fixed and confined to one Church, as thoſe uſually called Biſhops then were; ſo that to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trovert whether <hi>Peter, Paul, Timothy, Titus, Luke, &amp;c.</hi> were Biſhops, is a meer ignorant ſtrife <hi>de nomine,</hi> about the name, while we are, or eaſily may be, agreed of the thing, what work for thoſe Churches they performed. They were <hi>Biſhops eminenter,</hi> tranſient from Church to Church; but he degradeth them that feigneth them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed to any one as their ſole and proper Flock.</p>
               <p rend="small">2. <hi>Note</hi> further, That <hi>Titus</hi> ordaining Elders (that is, Biſhops, as Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> noteth) implieth the peoples conſent; for <hi>Titus</hi> had no forcing power.</p>
               <p rend="small">3. That <hi>Crete</hi> is ſaid to have an hundred Cities in it, being but a ſmall Iſland; and ſo muſt have an hundred Biſhops, if every City had one. But doubtleſs <hi>Paul</hi> meaneth every City that had Chriſtians in it enough to be a Church.</p>
               <p rend="small">4. That by <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, is meant any big Town, ſuch as our Corporations are, and <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>oppidatim,</hi> is meant from Town to Town, where there is matter for a Church. And <hi>Paul</hi> never meant by this to confine Biſhops to Cities, and forbid them to Villages, but he nameth Cities or Towns, becauſe then no other places had Chriſtians enow for a Church.</p>
               <p rend="small">5. Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> thinks that theſe Biſhops then were only the ſingle Paſtors of ſingle Congregations, having no Sub-Presbyters, but Deacons.</p>
               <p rend="small">6. The ordering of things wanting was not adding to their Faith and Religion, or making them a Book of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons; but ſeeing them reduced to the obedient and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly practice of that which the Apoſtles every where taught and ſettled.</p>
               <p n="6">6. If any be blameleſs, the husband of one wife, having faithful children, not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed of riot, or unruly.</p>
               <p rend="small">6. <hi>Note</hi>; If God bleſs not the Education of his own Children, 1. The Church would doubt of his Fidelity, or whether God will bleſs his greater undertaking. 2. And his Family would be a ſcandal to Religion.</p>
               <p n="7">7. For a Biſhop muſt be blameleſs, as the ſteward of God: not ſelf-willed, not ſoon angry, not given to wine, no ſtriker, not given to filthy lucre:</p>
               <p rend="small">7. <hi>Note</hi>; That the ſame man is called a Biſhop here, who was called an Elder, <hi>v.</hi> 5. If then they were diſtinct Offices, <hi>Paul</hi> neglected to deſcribe one of them, which is not credible when he deſcribeth Deacons &amp; Deaconeſſes,
<pb facs="tcp:66325:239"/>
Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> confeſſeth that there were in Scripture-times no Subject-Presbyters, ſave Biſhops, that were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Apoſtolick Order; but he thinks that Biſhops had power from the Apoſtles to inſtitute another Order of Presbyters under them afterwards: But 1. Where is there any proof of that? Muſt Church-Government caſt out all Miniſters who believe not ſuch an unproved Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion? 2. It's thus diſproved: <hi>Paul</hi> giveth <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> ſufficient Inſtructions what Officers to Ordain in the Church (which Canons were to be a Guide to all after-Ages.) But <hi>Paul</hi> gave them no Inſtruction or Canon for the Inſtituting of any New Order between Biſhops (or Elders) and Deacons: Therefore it is not credible that any ſuch power was then given to other Biſhops, which he gave not to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p rend="small">But as to others, who ſay that the Apoſtles and Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts were then the only Biſhops, I anſwer, <hi>de re,</hi> we confeſs that theſe had power to go about to gather and ſettle Churches; and <hi>de nomine,</hi> whether ſuch may be called Biſhops, let them quarrel that have nothing elſe to do. But beſides them, every Town or Church had then their own fixed Biſhop (one or more) and Deacons. If Dioceſans or Metropolitans will be Succeſſors of the Iti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerant Apoſtles and Evangeliſts, or General Biſhops, let them reſtore to every Church their particular proper Biſhops, and not make Paſtors that have not the power of the Keys.</p>
               <p rend="small">As for them that ſay, <hi>Paul</hi> includeth both Orders un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſame names, Biſhops and Presbyters, I anſwer, <hi>Paul</hi> uſeth not only the ſame name, but the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, and ſo the <hi>Order</hi> or <hi>Office</hi> alſo muſt be the ſame; and both Name and Thing the ſame.</p>
               <p rend="small">2. Biſhops are God's Stewards, entruſted to govern by his Law; and not Lords of his Church, or of their Faith.</p>

               <p rend="small">2.

                  <hi>Note</hi>; Whether theſe were Deaconeſſes by Office or not, it is certain, 1. That all Aged women ſhould inſtruct the younger. 2. But becauſe few do their duty to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, it is of great uſe in a well ordered Church, that ſome few of the fitteſt be by Office choſen to this work, that the Miniſters may direct theſe Aged women in it, and not be themſelves too often with the younger ſort in private.</p>

               <p rend="small">4, 5. It is their work to teach the younger women to be wiſe, and of ſound Judgment, to love their Husbands, and Children, and ſhew it in their care and behaviour, to be diſcreet and chaſt in mind and behaviour; to keep at home, and look to their houſhold buſineſs, and not affect to be needleſly abroad in idleneſs, or under temptations; to be good, and ſubject to their Huſbands; for there is danger that the miſcarriages of young wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men may bring reproach on Religion and the Goſpel which they profeſs.</p>

                  <hi>Note</hi> 1. It was to Redeem us from our own ſin, and its effects, that Chriſt gave himſelf as our Saviour to be a Sacrifice for us. 2.

True Zeal is for Good works, and not for dead Ceremony, or worldly Intereſt, or odd Opinions, and dividing Sects. It is not furious, and hurtful, and envious, but firſt pure, and then peaceable, and ſets men upon earneſt endeavour to do good. 4. It is not only for us that Chriſt Redeemeth and Purifieth a Church and choſen People, but ultimately for himſelf, and for his own and his Fathers Glory and Complacence.

               <p n="3">3. For we our ſelves alſo were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times fooliſh, diſobedient, deceived, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving divers luſts and pleaſures, living in malice and envy, hateful, <hi>and</hi> hating one another.</p>
               <p rend="small">3. In our dealing with others we muſt uſe compaſſion, remembring that before our Converſion to Chriſt, we our ſelves had thoſe Vices which are reproachful in others; we were witleſs, unperſuadable, and diſobedient, deceived in the greateſt things, the ſervants of divers luſts and pleaſures, living in malice and envy againſt others, odious our ſelves, and with hatred purſuing one another. This was the Gentill life.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But after that the Kindneſs and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared; 5. Not by works of righteouſneſs, which we have done, but according to his mercy he ſaved us by the waſhing of regeneration; and renewing of the holy Ghoſt. 6. Which he ſhed on us abundantly, through Jeſus Chriſt our Saviour.</p>
               <p rend="small">4, 5, 6. But when the Saving-kindneſs and Love of God our Saviour to Fallen Man appeared to us by the Communication and Illumination of his Grace, not for any good works or deſerts of ours (for we were as bad, as aforeſaid) but of his meer free Mercy he ſaved us from that ſtate of ſin and miſery, by Regeneration ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and ſealed in Baptiſm, and by the renewing work of the Holy Ghoſt, which he poured out upon us in the extraordinary meaſure promiſed after Chriſts Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, both for Sanctification and confirming Miracles.</p>

               <p rend="small">8. This is a point of great importance, which I require thee oft to preſs upon them, that they which are Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians think not that they have nothing to do, but to mind Heaven, and pray, and worſhip God; but that they live in ſuch Callings or Trades in the world, in which labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diligently, they may be profitable to others, and the publick good, and not make Religion a Cloak for Idleneſs, but ſpend their time in that which is good and profitable to men.</p>

The overvaluing of ſuch conceits, and trifling diſputes, and thinking themſelves rare wiſe men for theſe, and gathering Parties to themſelves from the Church, to propagate them in Separation, and to draw Diſciples af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them, is the way of Hereticks: Whoever is ſuch a one (ſuppoſing private men do their part) do thou that art a publick Miniſter duly admoniſh him by meekneſs and convincing evidence of Truth, once and again; and if he hear not, reject him from the Communion of the Flock: For ſuch a man is fixed in his ſin by pride, ſelf-conceit, and a depraved Judgment; and being ſubverted into a ſinful Separation, is ſelf-condemned, both by the open profeſſion of his ſin, as if it were ſome glorious Truth and Duty, and by caſting himſelf out of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Church, ſo that he needeth neither Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs nor Judge to caſt him.</p>

               <p>THerefore we ought to give the more earneſt heed to the things which we have heard, leſt at any time we ſhould let them ſlip.</p>
               <p rend="small">1. Therefore we that have heard the Goſpel of Chriſt, and ſpecially who have profeſſed to receive it, ſhould with great earneſtneſs ſet our minds and hearts unto it, leſt by negligence or unbelief, we ſhould loſe what we have heard, and be as leaking Veſſels, and be loſt our ſelves.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For if the word ſpoken by angels was ſtedfaſt, and every tranſgreſſion and diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience received a juſt recompence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward:</p>
               <p rend="small">2. For if the Law which God delivered to <hi>Moſes,</hi> by the miniſtry of the voice and appearance of Angels, was yet firm and ſure, and every ſin againſt it, and threatned by it, was puniſhed.</p>
               <p n="3">3. How ſhall we eſcape, if we neglect ſo great ſalvation, which at the firſt began to be ſpoken by the Lord, <hi>and</hi> was confirmed unto us by them that heard <hi>him,</hi> 4. God alſo bearing them witneſs, both with ſigns and wonders, and with divers miracles, and gifts of the holy Ghoſt, according to his own will?</p>
               <p rend="small">3, 4. Much leſs ſhall we eſcape, if we neglect this far greater Salvation, and more excellent manifeſtation of the Will of God; even that Goſpel which Chriſt firſt preacht himſelf, and thoſe that heard him confirmed by their te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony and preaching; God alſo confirming to us <hi>their teſtimony</hi> from Heaven, by many ſuch ſigns and wonderful works, and with many ſorts of miracles or acts of Power, and diſtributions of the Holy Ghoſt to others when they believed, as were a certain proof of God's atteſtation, and the approbation of his own Will.</p>
               <p rend="small">
                  <hi>Note,</hi> That here we have the true evidence of the truth of the Goſpel, on which Believers may build their faith.</p>
               <p n="5">5. For unto angels hath he not put in ſubjection the world to come, whereof we ſpeak:</p>
               <p rend="small">5. God hath not made Angels the Soveraigns of the World to come, and put the Kingdom of Glory ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them, that all muſt be their Subjects.</p>
               <p n="6">6. But one in a certain place teſtified, ſaying, What is man, that thou art mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of him: or the ſon of man, that thou viſiteſt him? 7. Thou madeſt him a little lower than the angels, thou crownedſt him with glory and honour, and didſt ſet him over the works of thy hands: 8. Thou haſt put all things in ſubjection under his feet.</p>
               <p rend="small">6, 7, 8. But the Pſalm is ultimately to be underſtood of Chriſt and his Church, which ſaith, <hi>What is man, &amp;c.</hi> Though Chriſt was a while on Earth, in a ſtate of Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, below Angels us to the Fleſh; yet it was in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the Glory, and victorious Power of his Kingdom.</p>
               <p n="8">8. For in that he put all in ſubjection un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him, he left nothing that is not put un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him. But now we ſee not yet all things put under him.</p>
               <p rend="small">8. By this it is ſure that all things are to be ſubdued to Chriſt, though yet we ſee it not done.</p>
               <p n="9">9. But we ſee Jeſus, who was made a little lower than the angels, for the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of death, crowned with glory and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, that he by the grace of God ſhould taſte death for every man.</p>
               <p rend="small">9. But we ſee that Jeſus, who was made lower than Angels, for and in his ſtate of Humiliation and Crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion, is already aſcended up into Heaven, where he is crowned with Glory. And as his death was ſuffered in the common nature of Man, and the ſins of all men had a cauſal hand in it, and it was by God's Grace the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſing Cauſe of the conditional Covenant of Grace, and of all the good that men receive, ſo he dyed to bring Man to Glory with himſelf. And therefore that Text may well be underſtood of the advancement of Man, both in Chriſt, and his Church, that ſhall be advanced by him.</p>
               <p n="10">10. For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many ſons unto glory, to make the captain of their ſalvation perfect through ſufferings.</p>
               <p rend="small">10. For it ſeemed meet to the God of Wiſdom, for whom, and by whom all things are, to make Chriſt the Captain of their Salvation, a perfect performer of his Saving-Office, and to obtain his own Glory in heavenly Perfection by the way of ſuffering, and to bring all God's adopted Sons to Glory by the Merit of it, and by fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing him in the ſame ſuffering way.</p>
               <p n="11">11. For both he that ſanctifieth, and they who are ſanctified, are all of one: for which cauſe he is not aſhamed to call them bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, 12. Saying, I will declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midſt of the church will I ſing praiſe unto thee. 13. And again,
<pb facs="tcp:66325:242"/>
I will put my truſt in him: and again, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, I, and the children which God hath given me.</p>
               <p rend="small">11, 12, 13. And that it is in and by Chriſt, that Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature is advanced, as the <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8. ſaith, is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the Union that is between Chriſt and us. He that ſanctifieth us, and we that are ſanctified are of the ſame Humane Nature, and are as one Body: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as we muſt ſuffer with him, we ſhall reign with him. Therefore in the Texts that, under other typical perſons, ſpeak of Chriſt, he calls us his Brethren, and Children given him, to whoſe truſt we are committed.</p>
               <p n="14">14, 15. Foraſmuch then as the children are partakers of fleſh and blood, he alſo himſelf likewiſe took part of the ſame, that through death he might deſtroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil: And deliver them, who through fear of death, were all their life time ſubject to bondage.</p>
               <p rend="small">14, 15. And that he might bring us to Glory with him, as we have fleſh and blood, he would firſt be ſo far made one with us, as to take alſo fleſh and blood, that he might be capable of ſuffering and dying for us; and ſo, by undergoing death, which we by ſin had brought our ſelves under, and by riſing from the Dead, he might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer Satan and Death, and deſtroy his Kingdom and Power of Death, which he had obtained by conquering Man by his Temptations, and by God's letting him be the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner, where he had been the conquering Tempter; and ſo that Chriſt might deliver the Faithful by his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of Satan and Death, from continuance under Death, and from the danger of Hell, and from the ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh fear of both (Death temporal and everlaſting;) who elſe, by their guilt, and liableneſs to both theſe, muſt be all their life time in bondage, both by their danger and their fears.</p>
               <p n="16">16. For verily he took not on him <hi>the nature of</hi> angels: but he took on <hi>him</hi> the ſeed of Abraham.</p>
               <p rend="small">16. For it is not Angels that he took hold of, or whoſe Natures he aſſumed, and came to ſave; but he took on him the Nature of Man, the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> to ſave Man.</p>
               <p n="17">17. Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high prieſt, in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the ſins of the people.</p>
               <p rend="small">17. So that he muſt be in all things like Man, whom he would ſave, that he might be fit for his undertaken Office, to be an High Prieſt for us to Godward, and to be merciful and faithful therein, to make Reconciliation for our ſins.</p>
               <p n="18">18. For in that he himſelf hath ſuffered, being tempted, he is able to ſuccour them that are tempted.</p>
               <p rend="small">18. For he himſelf having been tempted and tryed by Sufferings, and having overcome them all, he is now more meet to be a Compaſſionate Helper, the Example, the Teacher, and the Truſt of them that muſt follow him through temptations; and by his Merit and Victory, hath obtained power to deliver them.</p>

               <p rend="small">
                  <hi>Note</hi>; This Sabbatiſm or Reſt, no doubt, is All the ſtate of the Churches deliverance and felicity by Chriſt Incarnate and Glorified, which in the firſt-fruits is all the Grace which he giveth us on Earth, but in the proper, full performance it is the ſtate of Glory.</p>
               <p rend="small">I have before ſaid why I aſſent not to Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> whom maketh it to be the deliverance of Chriſtians from Perſecution, and enjoying peaceable Aſſemblies by the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as if this were the main ſenſe of the Text. 1. How little a thing was that in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Saving Grace and Glory? 2. Moſt of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians to whom <hi>Paul</hi> wrote, were to die before that, and ſo not to ſee and enjoy it. 3. The Apoſtles themſelves were not to ſee it and enjoy it. 4. Chriſtianity continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, after that, a perſecuted hated thing under the Heathen, till above three hundred years, till <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s time, though with intermiſſions between the Ten Perſecutions. Multitudes more were martyred by the Heathens than by the Jews, who were in ſervitude themſelves. 5. And if any apply it to the time after <hi>Coſtantine,</hi> the mercy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed was unſpeakable, but thoſe that were here written to, were not to ſee it: And the Voice that is reported to ſay, <hi>Hodiè venenum funditur in Eccleſiam,</hi> hath by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence been ſo far credited, that we muſt not prefer the Prelatical Grandure and Power, which ſhortly was ſet up, before the better Reſt of Saints; while we think how much <hi>Peaceable Aſſemblies</hi> (which the Doctor calls that Reſt) through a great part of the Chriſtian World, have been hindered and perſecuted by Violence, Inquiſitions, Priſons, and the Blood of many hundred thouſand more than the Jews killed, by the Canons, and Executions of Papal Greatneſs, and for its Intereſt.</p>
               <p rend="small">And it is incredible that to the ſuffering Believers of that Age, the Holy Ghoſt comforting them with this great Promiſe or a Sabbatiſm or Reſt, ſhould not princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally mean the great and glorious final Reſt.</p>
               <p n="10">10. For he that is entred into his reſt, he alſo hath ceaſed from his own works, as God <hi>did</hi> from his.</p>
               <p rend="small">10. For as God is ſaid to reſt and ſanctifie the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, when he ended his ſix days work; ſo our Sabba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm or Reſt muſt be a ceaſing from our own works, that is, 1. From Sin. 2. From thoſe Wilderneſs Labours, or troubleſom means (as ſorrow, fear, conflict, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) which are ſhort of the End. And 3. From Suffering.</p>

               <p n="4">4. For it is impoſſible for thoſe who were once enlightned, and have taſted of
<pb facs="tcp:66325:245"/>
the heavenly gift, and were made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the holy Ghoſt, 5. And have taſted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come; 6. If they ſhall fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, to renew them again unto repentance: ſeeing they crucifie to themſelves the Son of God afreſh, &amp; put him to an open ſhame.</p>
               <p rend="small">4, 5, 6. I will not now go back to Preach Regeneration to you that profeſs to be already regenerate, though you are tempted to Apoſtacy: For it is impoſſible for thoſe that were illuminated to believe in Chriſt, and were baptized, and have not only heard of the ſignal Gifts of the Holy Ghoſt from Heaven, but have themſelves had an experimental taſt thereof, and been themſelves par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the Holy Ghoſt, as well as ſeen his miraculous Gifts in the Church, and have had an inward experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental taſt of the truth and goodneſs of the Goſpel, and the powerful preparations and hopes of the World to come; If they ſhall really loſe all this, and fall from the belief of Chriſtianity, to regenerate or renew theſe men again to ſaving Repentance, ſeeing after believing Chriſt to be the Meſſiah, they are turned to take him for a Deceiver and Blaſphemer, and conſent to the pretended Juſtneſs of his Crucifixion, and ſo expoſe him by ſlander to the ſame reproach, as his Crucifiers did.</p>
               <p rend="small">
                  <hi>Note</hi> 1. That the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of no other falling away, but to Infidelity, denying Jeſus to be the Chriſt. 2. That it is not Temptation to Unbelief, nor a degree of Unbelief mixt with Faith, or doubting, that he ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of, but a forſaking and renouncing Chriſt. 3. He ſpeaketh not of the meer denyal of the Tongue in a paſſion or fear, but of the renouncing Chriſt by heart and tongue. 4. He ſpeaketh not of the act of a man in madneſs, or melancholy, who is not himſelf, but of a man's deliberate act, that hath free uſe of reaſon, 5. He ſpeaketh of no Infidels, or total Apoſtates, but thoſe that had themſelves been partakers of the ſignal Gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, and were convinced by experimental guſt of the Truth. 6. Therefore it muſt be noted, that not only truly holy perſons, but abundance (if not the greateſt part) that did but ſo believe as to imbody with the Church, had then one ſort or other of theſe miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, or rare Gifts for Confirmation of the Goſpel, which made Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. bring in the workers of iniquity as wonder-workers in his name; and <hi>Paul, Gal.</hi> 3.3, 4, 5. appealeth to the quarrelſom <hi>Galatians,</hi> which way they had the Spirit and Miracles. 7. That this muſt needs be the ſame Blaſphemy of the Holy Ghoſt, which Chriſt pronounceth unpardonable: For they who had not only ſeen the Miracles, but had the Holy Ghoſt themſelves for ſome ſuch wonders, could not doubt of the matter of fact, whether ſuch Miracles were extant or not: So that there was no poſſible way for ſuch to turn Infidels, but by believing that this Witneſs of the Spirit of Miracles, was a falſe, deceiving Teſtimony of Satan, and not God's Teſtimony: And this was the Blaſphemy againſt the Spirit, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 8. That it is not all that is here meant, that ſuch are not to be abſolved by the Church (which ought but to fore-judge, as God will judge, as far as they can:) But that alſo ſuch can never truly be regenerate and ſaved. 9. The reaſon is, becauſe God giveth Faith by means, and the Witneſs of the Spirits ſignal Gifts is the laſt means for proof that God will give them; and they that after receiving this, reject it by ſuch Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy, are forſaken by the Grace of the Spirit, whom they blaſphemouſly renounce. 10. Crucifying Chriſt afreſh importeth charging him to deſerve Crucifixion, as guilty of the deceit and blaſphemy for which he was crucified: So that none that believe not the Spirit's Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles in fact, are guilty of this ſin, though they be Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels. Some Ancients, and moſt Papiſts expound [<hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible</hi>] by [<hi>Difficult</hi>;] but I think ungroundedly. 11. Yea, the Jews that crucified him were not ſuch as here are deſcribed; for they had not before believed and received the Holy Ghoſt: It is the worſt reproach of Chriſt for a profeſſed Chriſtian to ſay [I did believe in him, and had the Spirit my ſelf, and ſaw and did ſignal Works or Miracles, and I found at laſt that he was but a Deceiver, and all theſe Gifts were the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of evil Spirits.]</p>
               <p n="7">7, 8. For the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it, and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dreſſed, receiveth bleſſing from God. 8. But that which beareth thorns and briers, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, and is nigh unto curſing, whoſe end is to be burned.</p>
               <p rend="small">7, 8. For as the Earth is bleſt, or juſtly praiſed, which bringeth Fruit when it is watered and manured; but that is called curſed, and bad, whoſe fruit muſt be for the fire, which bringeth forth but Thorns and Briars: So God will bleſs and reward them who fruitfully anſwer the means which he uſeth in them; but will curſe and burn thoſe who, after the greateſt means, and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental partaking of the ſignal gifts of the Spirit, ſhall turn to reproach and blaſpheme him whom they belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in.</p>

               <p n="13">13, 14.

               <p>FOr this Melchiſedec king of Salem, prieſt of the moſt high God, who met Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham returning from the ſlaughter of the kings, and bleſſed him: 2.

               <p rend="small">1, 2. This <hi>Melchiſedec,</hi> to whom <hi>Abraham</hi> gave the Tenths of the Spoils, was King of Righteouſneſs by the ſignification of his name; and King of Peace, interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his place: which Chriſt is eminently, whom he typified.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Without father, without mother, without deſcent; having neither beginning of days, nor end of life: but made like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Son of God, abideth a prieſt conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually.</p>

The Hiſtory of him maketh no mention of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or Mother, or Deſcent, nor of his Birth or Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, nor of his death or end; but deſcribeth him like a continuing Prieſt, and a Type of the Son of God, who abideth a Prieſt continually.</p>
               <p rend="small">
                  <hi>Note,</hi> The Jews think he was <hi>Shem,</hi> whoſe Beginning was not ſeen by the new World, nor his End by the Old, nor his Death mentioned: But this is a preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption: Had it been good for us to know more of him, God would have told us more.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Now conſider how great this man was, unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the ſpoils.</p>
               <p rend="small">
                  <pb facs="tcp:66325:246"/>4. When <hi>Abraham,</hi> from whom the Levitical Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and the peculiar Seed, ſprung, gave him the Tenths of all the Spoils, it tells us how great a man <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedec</hi> was.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And verily they that are of the ſons of Levi, who receive the office of the prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people, according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though they come out of the loins of Abraham.</p>
               <p rend="small">5. The Law allowed <hi>Aaron,</hi> and the other Prieſts, to take Tythes of their Brethren that ſprung from <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. But he whoſe deſcent is not counted from them, received tithes of Abraham, and bleſſed him that had the promiſes. 7. And without all contradiction, the leſs is bleſſed of the better.</p>
               <p rend="small">6, 7. But <hi>Melchiſedec</hi> received Tythes of <hi>Abraham,</hi> who was none of his people; and bleſſed him, who had from God the promiſe of a peculiar Off-ſpring: Which is a certain ſign that he was greater than <hi>Abraham</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And ſo is Chriſt greater than the Jewiſh Prieſts.</p>
               <p n="8">8. And here men that die receive tithes: but there he <hi>receiveth them,</hi> of whom it is witneſſed that he liveth. 9. And as I may ſo ſay, Levi alſo, who receiveth tithes, pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed tithes in Abraham. 10. For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchiſedec met him.</p>
               <p rend="small">8, 9, 10. And here it is Mortal Men that take Tythes; but <hi>Melchiſedec</hi> is mentioned as if he had not dyed: And <hi>Levi,</hi> who receiveth Tythes, paid them, then being in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Loyns.</p>
               <p n="11">11. If therefore perfection were by the Levitical prieſthood (for under it the people received the law) what further need was there that another prieſt ſhould riſe after the order of Melchiſedec, and not be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led after the order of Aaron?</p>
               <p rend="small">11. This proveth that the Levitical Prieſthood (and conſequently the Law) was not perfect, nor gave per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection: elſe what need had there been of another more excellent Royal Prieſthood which was promiſed.</p>
               <p n="12">12. For the prieſthood being changed, there is made of neceſſity a change alſo of the law.</p>
               <p rend="small">11<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 12, And if there muſt be a more excellent Prieſthood than the Legal, there muſt needs be ſome other more excellent Laws, appointing them their work: For the old Prieſthood had their work preſcribed them by the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi>

               <p n="13">13. For he of whom theſe things are ſpoken, pertaineth to another tribe, of which no man gave attendance at the altar. 14. For it is evident that our Lord ſprang out of Judah, of which tribe Moſes ſpake nothing concerning prieſthood.</p>
               <p rend="small">13, 14. And the tranſlating the Prieſthood to <hi>Judah,</hi> the ruling Tribe, of which Chriſt was, proveth the Change of the Law.</p>
               <p n="15">15. And it is yet far more evident: for that after the ſimilitude of Melchiſedec there ariſeth another prieſt, 16. Who is made not after the law of a carnal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, but after the power of an end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs life.</p>
               <p rend="small">15, 16. And it is yet more evident, that there muſt be a higher Prieſthood than <hi>Aaron</hi>'s, becauſe he muſt be made as <hi>Melchiſedec</hi>; not by Lineal Succeſſion, according to the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> but with reference to a ſtate of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality, as to its Riſe and End.</p>
               <p n="17">17. For he teſtifieth, Thou art a prieſt for ever after the order of Melchiſedec. 18. For there is verily a diſannulling of the commandment going before, for the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and unprofitableneſs thereof.</p>
               <p rend="small">17, 18, And this expreſs teſtimony of another ſort of Prieſthood ſheweth, that the Law, which they were to execute, was to ceaſe, as weak, inſufficient and unprofitable.</p>

               <p n="1">1. NOw of the things which we have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, <hi>this is</hi> the ſum: we have ſuch an high prieſt, who is ſet on the right hand of the throne of the majeſty in the heavens: 2. A miniſter of the ſanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man.</p>
               <p rend="small">1. The ſum of all that's ſaid is this, We have ſuch an High Prieſt, who is advanced to the higheſt honour and power in Glory, called God's Throne of Majeſty in the Heavens. As Man, a Miniſter indeed, or the prime Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrator; but it is of the true and heavenly Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Tabernacle, not like that which was made by Man, but which the Lord hath made for the glorifying of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in his glorified Saints with Chriſt, where we ſhall in preſence worſhip him for ever.</p>
               <p n="3">3. For every high prieſt is ordained to offer gifts and ſacrifices: wherefore it is of neceſſity that this man have ſomewhat to offer.</p>
               <p rend="small">3. And he were no High Prieſt, if he had nothing as Gift or Sacrifice to offer.</p>
               <p n="4">4. For if he were on earth, he ſhould not be a prieſt, ſeeing that there are prieſts that offer gifts according to the law.</p>
               <p rend="small">4. And if he were on Earth, he ſhould not be a Prieſt according to the Law, becauſe there are ſuch already, and it was entailed on the Line of <hi>Aaron:</hi> (And Chriſt's Sacrifice when he was on Earth, was not according to the Law, but ſupralegal.)</p>
               <p n="5">5. Who ſerve unto the example and ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of heavenly things, as Moſes was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed of God, when he was about to make the tabernacle. For ſee (ſaith he) that thou make all things according to the pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern ſhewed to thee in the mount.</p>
               <p rend="small">5. And the Levitical Prieſthood on Earth, was made to perform thoſe Adminiſtrations, which are but ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows of the heavenly things, having ſome notifying and inſtructing reſemblance to them as figurative; which God darkly intimated to <hi>Moſes,</hi> when he charged him to
<pb facs="tcp:66325:247"/>
make the Tabernacle in the Wilderneſs according to the pattern which he had ſeen in the Mount. So that the earthly Tabernacle and Worſhip is but a figure or ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of the Heavenly.</p>
               <p n="6">6. But now hath he obtained a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent miniſtery, by how much alſo he is the Mediator of a better covenant, which was eſtabliſhed upon better promiſes.</p>
               <p rend="small">6. But Chriſt's Prieſtly Miniſtry is more excellent, as he is the Mediator of a better Covenant, than the meer Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> was. (Though the Promiſe that went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and with the Law, was an obſcure Goſpel.) It is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as having better Promiſes; even <hi>clearer</hi> and <hi>fuller,</hi> and more <hi>confirmed</hi> by <hi>God</hi>'s Oath, and Seal, and Earneſt. It hath Promiſes of fuller Pardon, greater Grace and Priviledges, and ſurer and greater Glory.</p>
               <p rend="small">
                  <hi>Note,</hi> That both the Moſaical and the Chriſtian are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in Scripture, both a <hi>Law</hi> and a <hi>Covenant</hi>; for they have the ſame parts, <hi>viz. Precepts, Promiſes</hi> and <hi>Threats,</hi> and <hi>Obedience</hi> muſt be conſented to. As propoſed by God, with his Antecedent Mercy, it is a Law, and a propoſed Covenant (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.) As conſented to by Man, it is a Law accepted by Subjects, and a mutual Covenant (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.) See <hi>Grotius</hi> his Preface to Annotations on the New Teſtament of the Names.</p>
               <p n="7">7. For if that firſt <hi>covenant</hi> had been fault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, then ſhould no place have been ſought for the ſecond.</p>
               <p rend="small">7. For if the firſt Covenant had been perfect, God would not have made the ſecond better.</p>
               <p rend="small">
                  <hi>Note,</hi> 1. That it is not ſinful Faultineſs, but ſuch Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection as the beginnings of Art and Nature have, compared with the Perfection that is here meant.</p>
               <p rend="small">2. It is not here called, the <hi>Firſt Covenant,</hi> as if no other had gone before it; for there was a former with <hi>Adam, Noah, Abraham:</hi> but as it is the firſt of theſe two. And it was a Covenant of Peculiarity, diſtinct from the common one, and the Promiſe.</p>
               <p n="8">8. For finding fault with them, he ſaith, Behold, the days come (ſaith the Lord) when I will make a new covenant with the houſe of Iſrael, and the houſe of Judah: 9. Not according to the Covenant that I made with their fathers, in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt, becauſe they continued not in my covenant, and I regarded them not, ſaith the Lord.</p>
               <p rend="small">8, 9. For he intimateth the defect of the Moſaical Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, when he ſaith, <hi>Behold, the days come,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I will make with them a new Covenant,</hi> of greater and ſurer Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; for the former they quickly forſook, and I forſook them.</p>
               <p n="10">10. For this is the covenant that I will make with the houſe of Iſrael after thoſe days, ſaith the Lord, I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they ſhall be to me a people.</p>
               <p rend="small">10. But this is my new Covenant which I will make with all <hi>Abraham</hi>'s believing Seed: I will ſanctifie them by my Spirit, and thereby give them a ſaving knowledge and love of all my neceſſary Laws, and their Duties, as if they were written in their minds and hearts; and I will be to them a God (which is their All) and will love and cheriſh them as my peculiar people.</p>
               <p rend="small">
                  <hi>Note,</hi> That this Promiſe is not made to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar, political Body (for their Policy was to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved) but as a part of the Catholick Church, which are <hi>Abraham</hi>'s believing Seed: 2. Therefore it being ſuppoſed that it is to Believers that this Promiſe is made, it followeth, that it is a Promiſe on condition of prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Faith: As Vocation giveth Faith, which is the Condition of conſequent Juſtification and Sanctification. Though all be of Grace, God's Wiſdom maketh the Condition a means to introduce the reſt.</p>
               <p n="11">11. And they ſhall not teach every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, ſaying, Know the Lord: for all ſhall know me, from the leaſt to the greateſt.</p>
               <p rend="small">11. And it ſhall not be doubtful to them, whether the Lord or <hi>Baal</hi> be the true God, as it hath been with this unſtedfaſt People, who have ſo long lived in Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try: For all the Church of Believers, from the leaſt to the greateſt, ſhall know and own me to be their God, and not need to be again taught it, as an unknown thing.</p>
               <p rend="small">
                  <hi>Note,</hi> That this ſpeaketh not againſt the neceſſity of Humane Teaching: for it is by ſuch teaching that God is ſuppoſed to give them the knowledge of himſelf. Nor doth it mean that it ſhall be needleſs to teach the beſt to know God better: for to know him is the ſum and perfection of Knowledge, and 'tis Life Eternal. But the meaning is, That it ſhall not be an unknown thing, that the Lord is our God.</p>
               <p n="12">12. For I will be merciful to their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs, and their ſins and their ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities will I remember no more.</p>

                  <hi>Note,</hi> That this Promiſe of Juſtification, as well as the former of Sanctification, ſuppoſeth them to be Believers in order of Nature firſt, as the Condition.</p>

               <p n="1">1. THen verily the firſt <hi>covenant</hi> had alſo ordinances of divine ſervice, and a worldly ſanctuary.</p>
               <p rend="small">1. The Moſaical Covenant had its proper Ordinances of Service to God, and an earthly, temporary Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For there was a tabernacle made, the firſt wherein was the candleſtick, and the table and the ſhew-bread, which is called the ſanctuary. 3. And after the ſecond vail, the tabernacle which is called the holieſt of all.</p>
               <p rend="small">2, 3. This made Tabernacle had two parts: In the firſt, called the Sanctuary, was the Candleſtick, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And within the ſecond Veil was the <hi>Holieſt of all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p rend="small">
                  <hi>Note,</hi> Some out of <hi>Philo</hi> ſay, that the Tabernacle (and the Temple after) was made as an Image, or Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of the World, and therefore called Worldly: the outer part figuring the lower World, in which was the Candleſtick with ſix Branches; and one in the midſt, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying the Planets; and twelve Loaves on the Table, ſignifying the Fruits of the Earth: The inmoſt ſignify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the higheſt Heavens. But 'tis preſumptuous to truſt our Wit too far in feigning Divine Significations: And 'tis groundleſs, hence to gather, that it was called a Worldly Sanctuary.</p>
               <p n="4">4, 5. Which had the golden cenſer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold, wherein was the golden pot that had manna, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant; And over it the cherubims of glory ſhadowing the mercy-ſeat; of which we cannot now ſpeak particularly.</p>
               <p rend="small">4, 5. In it was the Golden Cenſer, for Incenſe brought when the Prieſt went in; and the Ark overlaid with Gold, in which, or near it, was the Pot of Manna, and <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Rod, and in it the Table of the Commandments of the Covenant; and over it, the Images of Angelical Cherubims, ſhewing God's Glory, when it appeared to men; which alſo ſhadowed the Covering, or Mercy-Seat.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Now when theſe things were thus or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, the prieſts went always into the firſt tabernacle, accompliſhing the ſervice of God. 7. But into the ſecond <hi>went</hi> the high prieſt alone once every year, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out blood, which he offered for himſelf, and for the errors of the people.</p>
               <p rend="small">6, 7. Into the firſt part of this Tabernacle, the Prieſts went to perform the ordinary Service: But into the ſecond, went only the High Prieſt once a Year, but not without the Blood of Calves and Goats, which he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for ſuch ſins of himſelf and the people as were expiable.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The holy Ghoſt this ſignifying, that the way into the holieſt of all, was not yet made manifeſt, while as the firſt tabernacle was yet ſtanding:</p>
               <p rend="small">8. By this the Holy Ghoſt ſignified that under that Law, or Tabernacle-ſtate, the Acceſs of Sinners to God, for aſſured Acceptance here, and Glory hereafter, was not yet clearly, fully, and with ſatisfiing Aſſurance re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, nor by that Law, as ſuch, conferred: for it was reſerved to the coming of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi>: (Though the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, or Law of Grace ſaved men then.)</p>
               <p n="9">9. Which <hi>was</hi> a figure for the time then preſent, in which were offered both gifts and ſacrifices, that could not make him that did the ſervice perfect, as pertaining to the conſcience.</p>
               <p rend="small">9. Which figuratively ſignified the time then (or now) preſent, when the Gifts and Sacrifices were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, which could not ſuffice to perfect the Acceptance of the Offerer with God, or to cleanſe him from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience and Guilt of Sin.</p>
               <p n="10">10. <hi>Which ſtood</hi> only in meats and drinks, and divers waſhings, and carnal ordinances impoſed on them until the time of reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p rend="small">10. I ſpeak not of the Laws of Nature, of Godlineſs, Charity, Juſtice and Sobriety, which are common to the Jews with us and other people, but of the (<gap reason="foreign">

And theſe Laws, in ſuch Outwards as the Body performeth, called Rites and Ceremonies, Meats, Drinks, Waſhings, which God indeed impoſed on them, as a material part of their Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; but it was as ſuited to their Carnality and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nority, till the <hi>Meſſiah</hi>'s Reformation ſet up a better Law and Worſhip</p>
               <p n="11">11. But Chriſt being come an high prieſt of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to ſay, not of this building:</p>
               <p rend="small">11. But Chriſt is come a High Prieſt of the future Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity, promiſed in the Goſpel, even to procure us Grace and Glory, officiating in a greater and more perfect Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle, even his Body, now glorified in Heaven (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving done his preparatory Work on Earth) which was not built as Tabernacles are on Earth.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Neither by the blood of goats and calves: but by his own blood he entred in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption <hi>for us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p rend="small">12. And not as the Levitical Prieſts, by the Blood of Goats and Calves, offered for Expiation; but by obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient and voluntary offering his own Blood a Sacrifice for the ſins of the World, he obtained his Entrance into the ſtate of Glorious Exaltation, there to intercede for us, and rule us, having here, by his Merit and Sacrifice, purchaſed Eternal Redemption for us, which thence he will beſtow.</p>
               <p n="13">
                  <pb facs="tcp:66325:248"/>13. For if the blood of bulls, and of goats, and the aſhes of an heifer ſprinkling the unclean, ſanctifieth to the purifying of the fleſh.</p>

               <p rend="small">14. Moſt certainly then ſhall the Blood of Chriſt, who by the Eternal Spirit offered himſelf, Soul and Body, a ſpotleſs Sacrifice to God the Soveraign Righteous Judge, to cleanſe Soul and Conſcience from the power and guilt of dead works (which ſignifie a death in ſin, and tend to death for ſin) to ſerve the Living God, who will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept us to an Everlaſting Life.</p>
               <p rend="small">
                  <hi>Note</hi>; By the <hi>Eternal Spirit,</hi> by which Chriſt offered himſelf, ſome Expoſitors underſtand Chriſt's Immortal Soul voluntarily reſigning his Life, 2. Others under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Holy Ghoſt, the Third Perſon in the Trinity, by whom Chriſt is ſaid to be conceived, and to do his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles. 3. Others underſtand his own Divine Nature, as the Second Perſon: It's hard to be ſure which is meant, but it is of no great moment, ſeeing it is certain that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he did it by all theſe three. There is a fourth Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of ſome that underſtand it of a prime ſuperangelical Nature of Chriſt, which they think, by Eternal Emana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, cometh from the Deity united to it, which they make a middle Third Nature in Chriſt; and in which they ſuppoſe it is that, as a Creature, he is advanced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all Angels; becauſe they take Angels and Men to to be <hi>ſpecie</hi> diſtinct, and that if Humane Nature muſt be ſet above Angels, in it ſelf, it muſt thereby change its ſpecies, and be no more humane. But to be wiſe to ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety in ſuch Myſteries is ſafe, and not to preſume.</p>
               <p n="15">15. And for this cauſe he is the media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour of the new teſtament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions <hi>that were</hi> under the firſt teſtament, they which are called might receive the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of eternal inheritance.</p>
               <p rend="small">15. And for this cauſe Chriſt became Mediator be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and Man, to procure, ſeal and promulgate the New Covenant, or Law of Grace, that his death do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that which no other Sacrifice could do in expiation of the Jews ſins, committed under the Moſaical Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, (as well as of the reſt of the World,) they which are by his call made ſound Believers, might by promiſe be ſecured of the Eternal Inheritance, and poſſeſſed of it in due time.</p>
               <p n="16">16. For where a teſtament is, there muſt alſo of neceſſity be the death of the teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour. 17. For a teſtament is of force after men are dead: otherwiſe it is of no ſtrength at all whileſt the teſtatour liveth.</p>
               <p rend="small">16, 17. And Chriſt being by his Sponſion to be a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, his Donation doth preſuppoſe his Purchaſe; and thence his Covenant hath alſo the nature of a Teſtament, which ſuppoſeth the death of the Teſtator, and is not of efficacy till then, to give full right to what he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queatheth.</p>
               <p rend="small">
                  <hi>Note</hi>; That the eminent Evangelical Kingdom of the Mediator, in its laſt full Edition, called the Kingdom of Chriſt, and of Heaven, diſtinct from the obſcure ſtate of Promiſe before Chriſt's Incarnation, began at Chriſt's Reſurrection, Aſcenſion, and ſending of the eminent Gift of the Holy Ghoſt, and was but as an <hi>Embrio</hi> before.</p>
               <p n="18">18. Whereupon, neither the firſt <hi>teſtament</hi> was dedicated without bloud.</p>
               <p rend="small">18. Therefore the firſt as figurative of the ſecond, was conſecrated and ſealed in blood.</p>
               <p n="19">19. For when Moſes had ſpoken every precept to all the people, according to the law, he took the bloud of calves and of goats, with water and ſcarlet wool, and hyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſop, and ſprinkled both the Book and all the people, 20. Saying, This is the bloud of the Teſtament which God hath enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto you. 21. Moreover he ſprinkled with bloud both the tabernacle, and all the veſſels of the miniſtry, 22. And almoſt all things are by the law purged with bloud: and without ſhedding of bloud is no remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
               <p rend="small">19, 20, 21, 22. <hi>Note</hi> 1. God purpoſely inſtituted all theſe bloody Purifications to prefigure Chriſt. 2. The Cuſtom of ſacrificing from the Fall, muſt ariſe from Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Inſtitution, and not without it from natural Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as ſome now affirm: And no doubt but it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated among all Idolaters through the World; 1. By Tradition from <hi>Adam</hi>; 2. Corrupted by Devils, who would be worſhipped as God, and to that end promote the imitation of God; 3. The Papiſts ſprinkling of Holy Water, is ſuch another corrupt imitation, ſetting up their Ceremony inſtead of Gods, which Chriſt aboliſhed.</p>
               <p n="23">23. It was therefore neceſſary that the patterns in things in the heavens ſhould be purified with theſe, but the heavenly things themſelves with better Sacrifices than theſe.</p>
               <p rend="small">23. Theſe Ceremonies being ordained to prefigure and notifie things that are in Heaven, and belong to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, it was meet that ſuch blood ſhould be the purifying Ceremony: But the heavenly things themſelves muſt be purchaſed, and the Souls fitted for it purified, and the Covenant conſecrated by a more precious Sacrifice, even the blood of the Lamb of God, who taketh away the ſins of the World.</p>
               <p n="24">24. For Chriſt is not entred into the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly places made with hands<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which are the figures of the true, but into heaven it ſelf; now to appear in the preſence of God for us.</p>
               <p rend="small">
                  <pb facs="tcp:66325:248"/>24. For it was not to officiate in a Tabernacle made by man, that Chriſt became our High Prieſt, but (though his Sacrifice was offered on Earth) it was to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiate by continued Interceſſion for us in the Heavens, in the preſence of God's Glory, of which the other was but a Type.</p>
               <p n="25">25. Nor yet that he ſhould offer himſelf often, as the high prieſt entreth into the holy place, every year with blood of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. 26. For then muſt he often have ſuffered ſince the foundation of the world: but now once in the end of the world, hath he appeared to put away ſin by the ſacrifice of himſelf.</p>
               <p rend="small">25, 26. <hi>Note</hi> 1. Chriſt's once offering was ſufficient: It may oft be commemorated, but only once done. 2. It is unſpeakable joy to Believers, that Chriſt is for us, as our High Prieſt, entred into Heaven. For he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed that we ſhall be with him where he is. And where elſe now ſhould we deſire to be? 3. The days of Chriſt here, were the declining latter part of the World, called the end, as fifty, or ſixty years old is the end, that is, the latter part of man's Life. How near then is it now to an end, 1684 after?</p>
               <p n="27">27, 28. And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the Judgment: So Chriſt was once offered to bear the ſins of many, and unto them that look for him ſhall he appear the ſecond time, without ſin, unto ſalvation.</p>
               <p rend="small">27, 28. And as it is with the common ſtate of man on Earth, who muſt all once die, and then be doomed to their endleſs ſtate; ſo Chriſt was once to die as a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for the ſins many; and to them that wait for him in the prepared ſtate of Faith, Hope, Obedience and Patience, he ſhall appear again, but not any more to bear the puniſhment of their ſins, but to juſtifie them publickly, and take them to his glory.</p>

               <p n="1">1. FOR the law having a ſhadow of good things to come, and not the very I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of the things, can never with thoſe ſacrifices which they offered year by year continually, make the commers thereunto perfect.</p>
               <p rend="small">1. For the Law having but in its Ceremonies a ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of the great heavenly Bleſſings of the Goſpel, and not the clear Image (or Draught or Map) of the things themſelves, doth ſhew by the frequent yearly iteration of thoſe Sacrifices, that it doth not perfect the Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For then would they not have ceaſed to be offered: becauſe that the worſhippers once purged, ſhould have had no more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of ſins.</p>

               <p n="3">3. But in thoſe <hi>ſacrifices there is</hi> a remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance again <hi>made</hi> of ſins every year. 4. For it is not poſſible that the bloud of bulls and of goats, ſhould take away ſins.</p>
               <p rend="small">3, 4. <hi>Note</hi> 1. This Text doth not deny that the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Jews were then forgiven, nor that the Law conduced to it, as uſed in ſubordination to the antecedent Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe and Law of Grace: But without this <hi>Promiſe,</hi> the Law could not do it. 2. Nor doth this infer, that we may not mention, lament and beg pardon for our old ſin, while we live on Earth: Nor that renewed ſins have no need of a renewed pardon; but no need of a new Sacrifice.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he ſaith. Sacrifice and offering thou wouldeſt not, but a body haſt thou prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me: 6.

               <p n="14">14. For by one offering he hath perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for ever them that are ſanctified.</p>
               <p rend="small">14. For all the faithful and ſanctified are by that one offering, as a ſufficient Expiatory Sacrifice, freed from all guilt and ſin now initially, and ſhall be perfectly without any other Expiatory Sacrifice, for ever.</p>
               <p n="15">15, 16, 17.

               <p rend="small">28, 29. Capital, preſumptuous ſins, and contempt, were puniſhed by death by <hi>Moſes</hi> Law. And as Chriſt bringeth greater mercy, the contempt of him deſerveth far greater puniſhment, when men by renouncing Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, tread under foot the Son of God, by calling him a crucified Deceiver, and count the Blood of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant (which was ſhed to ſanctifie them, and reconcile them to God,) which they profeſſing to believe, were joyned with the Saints, to be the blood of a juſtly cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified Malefactor, and a prophane thing, and thus do deſpight alſo to the Spirit of Grace, which is Chriſt's Witneſs on Earth, and by the Teſtimony of whoſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous and ſanctifying Gifts, they once profeſſed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Chriſt, and receive his Doctrine; and now they will reproach theſe Gifts and Teſtimonies of the Spirit, as deluſions, and not of the Spirit of God.</p>

Or cannot God ſtrengthen you now, when you ſhould be grown ſtronger? Remember how you endured to be made the common ſpectacle and ſcorn of men, by your own ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings (for ſufferers are uſually diſdained by the baſer multitude) and alſo by being the companions of thoſe that ſuffered, and openly owning them, and bore part of their afflictions.</p>
               <p n="34">34. For ye had compaſſion of me in my bonds, and took joyfully the ſpoiling of your goods, knowing in your ſelves that ye have in Heaven a better and an enduring ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
               <p rend="small">34. For I for one, muſt bear you witneſs, that in my bonds, you did partake in my ſufferings, by compaſſion; and alſo you took not only patiently, but joyfully, the loſs and ſpoiling of your goods and bodily maintenance, by the plunder and diſtreining of Perſecutors: And what made you do this, but that you firmly believed, yea knew, by the witneſs in your ſelves, atteſting the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of Chriſt, that you have (as to right) in Heaven a Treaſure incomparably better than that which you loſe, and ſuch as is endleſs, and none can rob you of.</p>

               <p rend="small">36.

               <p n="37">37. For yet a little while, and he that ſhall come, will come, and will not tarry.</p>

               <p rend="small">1. And ſeeing it is by Faith that you muſt obtain all this Victory, and Perſeverance and Salvation, it greatly concerneth you to underſtand rightly what that Faith is by which the juſt muſt live, and how it differeth from that living by ſight and ſenſe on worldly things, which is the caſe and life of the Children of perdition. This Faith is the ſubſiſtence, or firm and confident expectation from God of the things which we believing hope for, and which maketh them by the ſecurity of his faithful Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, to be effectual Motives to us, as if they were even preſent: And it is the convincing evidence, or demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration in the mind, of the unſeen things which God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealeth, by which they prevail with us againſt all the viſible vanities of this World. This realizing things fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and unſeen as certain by God's Promiſe, and over-coming Temptations from things ſeen and preſent, is our Saving Faith.</p>

               <p n="3">3. Through faith we underſtand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, ſo that things which are ſeen were not made of things which do appear.</p>
               <p rend="small">3. How can we know but by believing God's Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that Heaven and Earth were compacted and form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Word of God, ſo that all this great and well ordered frame which is ſeen, was made not of things which appear.</p>

And of all this they muſt give account to God; which, as it will be ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible to them if they be unfaithful, ſo it will be to you, if their faithfulneſs be without ſucceſs; which elſe, will be to the joy of them and you. And they have not any conſtraining power of the Sword and can govern and profit you only as voluntary, by your own conſent: and therefore, as you love your comfort, and regard them, and their Labours and Comfort, obey them, by obeying God's Word, which they preach.</p>

Alſo caſt away all filthineſs out of your thoughts, affections, ſpeech and practice, and all excrementitious naughtineſs, (or that ſuperfluity, which is but proviſion for the fleſh, to ſatisfie its luſt;) and with humble, tractable meekneſs, receive God's Word, not only opinionatively, but as the graff is taken into the tree, or your food, when it is digeſted into blood &amp; fleſh, thus made an innaturalized Word; and ſo received &amp; digeſted, it will ſave your Souls.</p>

            <p rend="small">22. But to think that bare hearing the Word will ſave you, is but ſelf-deceit: There muſt be inward practice by meditation, and outward practice in true obedience.</p>
            <p n="23">23. For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding his natural face in a glaſs: 24. For he beholdeth himſelf and goeth his way, and ſtraightway forgetteth what manner of man he was.</p>
            <p rend="small">23, 24. An unprofitable cuſtom of bare hearing, and not doing, is but like a man's looking his face in a glaſs, who ſo goeth away, and minds it no more, or forgets it, which neither feedeth nor cloatheth him, nor cureth his diſeaſes; ſuch are theſe cuſtomary, dull Speculators.</p>
            <p n="25">25. But whoſo looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth <hi>therein,</hi> he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man ſhall be bleſſed in his deed.</p>
            <p rend="small">25.

               <p n="1">1. MY brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt <hi>the Lord</hi> of glory, with reſpect of perſons.</p>
               <p rend="small">1. And you that profeſs to believe the Glory of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, which the pooreſt Chriſtians ſhall partake of equally with the rich, and to which all world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly glory is but vanity, muſt not now make a great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in the Church between rich men and the poor, by a worldly reſpect of perſons for their riches.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For if there come unto your aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly a man with a gold ring, in goodly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel, and there come in alſo a poor man, in vile raiment: 3. And ye have reſpect to him that weareth the gay clothing, and and ſay unto him, Sit thou here in a good place; and ſay to the poor, Stand thou there, or ſit here under my footſtool: 4. Are ye not then partial in your ſelves, and are become judges of evil thoughts?</p>
               <p rend="small">2, 3, 4. If in your Church-Aſſemblies you inordinately ſhew reſpect to men for gay cloathing, as rich, and ſet light by men, that by their garb ſeem poor, do you not ſhew a carnal partiality, by overvaluing wealth, and a Judgment miſguided by evil eſtimation?</p>
               <p rend="small">
                  <hi>Note</hi> 1. That this ſpeaketh not againſt honouring <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates,</hi> but <hi>Riches.</hi> 2. Nor againſt a prudent reſpect to the Rich, ſo far as by their wealth they may be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to do more good than others. 3. And I think thoſe miſtake, that rather expound this of meetings of Biſhops for Judicature (as Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi>) than other Church-Aſſemblies: For, 1. If they mean any forcing Judicatures, Chriſtians had none ſuch, there being then no Chriſtian Magiſtrates that had the power of the Sword. 2. And if Biſhops had been like our Dioceſans, and ſo diſtant, they could not have travelled ſo far as ſuch muſt do to keep up ordinary Judicatures, without a total deſerting their chief work for their Flocks. 3. And as they truly were (Congregational Biſhops) over no more than one of our Pariſhes, their diſtance between City and City was too great for this, without the like omiſſions. 4. Chriſtians having then no Judicial Power but as Arbitrators, the Contenders choſe what Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors they thought beſt. 5. Their Publick Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment was exerciſed in the ſame Aſſemblies which met for Worſhip, which therefore are liker here to be mentioned with reſpect to their moſt uſual buſineſs, and not the rarer. 6. It is the whole Church, and not the Biſhops only, that is here admoniſhed. 7. It is too hard a cenſure for ſuch men to uſe, as are pleading for too much honour to Biſhops, to ſuppoſe them ſo early guilty of ſo much partiality and carnal reſpect to fine cloths and riches, and ſo much Injuſtice in Judging as this Doctor's Expoſition doth ſuppoſe: It's liker to be the vulgars fault.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Hearken my beloved brethren, Hath not God choſen the poor of this world, rich in faith, and heirs of the Kingdom, which he hath promiſed to them that love him?</p>
               <p rend="small">5. Conſider how God himſelf confuteth your over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuing rich men, and vilifying the poor: Is it not moſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the poor that your Churches conſiſt? Is it not them that God hath choſen, poor in the World, but rich in Faith, to be here made Heirs, and hereafter Poſſeſſors of that Kingdom of Glory, which he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to them that truly love him.</p>
               <p n="6">6, 7. But ye have deſpiſed the poor. Do not rich men oppreſs you, and draw you before the judgment ſeats? Do not they blaſpheme that worthy name, by the which ye are called?</p>
               <p rend="small">6, 7. Yet you deſpiſe the poor, whom God himſelf chuſeth and honoureth: And doth not your own expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience and ſuffering condemn you? Who is it but rich men that oppreſs you by tyranny, and draw you, like Malefactors, before their Courts of Judicature? Do they not blaſpheme the name of Chriſt, and reproach your Religion?</p>
               <p n="8">8. If ye fulfil the royal law, according to the ſcripture: Thou ſhalt love thy neighbour as thy ſelf, ye do well.</p>
               <p rend="small">8, I perſuade you, not to hate men for their riches, but not to think that theſe allow you ſo partial a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rencing: If you obey God's great Command, as the Scripture teacheth you; to love all ſorts of your neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours as your ſelves, according to the various degrees of their trueſt amiableneſs (be they rich or poor) you then do well.</p>
               <p n="9">9. But if ye have reſpect to perſons, ye commit ſin, <hi>and</hi> are convinced of the law as tranſgreſſors.</p>
               <p rend="small">9. But if you thus inordinately reſpect men differently for their wealth, not only the Goſpel of Love, but the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> convinceth you as ſinners, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.3. <hi>Lev.</hi> 30.15. <hi>Deut.</hi> 1.16, 17.</p>
               <p n="10">10. For whoſoever ſhall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all. 11. For he that ſaid, Do not commit adultery; ſaid alſo, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a tranſgreſſor of the law.</p>
               <p rend="small">10, 11. And that Law condemneth all that continue not in all things therein written, to do them; and we are bound by God's Law inforce to univerſal Obedience. If
<pb facs="tcp:66325:256"/>
you keep all other Commands, and preſumptuouſly break one, you are contemners of the Law, and ſo interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively break all.</p>
               <p n="12">12. So ſpeak ye, and ſo do, as they that ſhall be judged by the law of liberty.</p>
               <p rend="small">12. And though you are delivered from <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law, and the Covenant of Works, remember that Chriſt is your King, and Law-giver, and you are not lawleſs; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſo ſpeak, and ſo do, as they that are under his Law of Liberty and Grace, and ſhall be judged by it, by Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification or Condemnation.</p>
               <p n="13">13. For he <hi>ſhall have</hi> judgment without mercy, that hath ſhewed no mercy; and mercy rejoyceth againſt judgment.</p>
               <p rend="small">13. For though this be a Law of Mercy, it will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the unmerciful without mercy: It hath its condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of life or death, though none but what conſiſt with Grace: But the merciful ſhall find mercy at Judgment: And God's mercy in Chriſt as the cauſe, and their mercy to men for his ſake, as the condition, will prevail againſt condemning Judgment.</p>
               <p n="14">14. What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man ſay he hath faith, and have not works? can faith ſave him?</p>
               <p rend="small">14. Is not a meer wordy Profeſſion an unprofitable thing to your ſelves, as well as to others?

                  <p>NOthing but mens miſunderſtanding the plain drift and ſenſe of <hi>Paul's</hi> Epiſtles, could make ſo many take it for a matter of great difficulty to reconcile <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>James,</hi> where there is no conſiderable ſhew of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction. I have ſhewed the ſcope and ſenſe of <hi>Paul</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> 1. That his arguing is to prove that it is not the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> that can juſtifie any man as a meer doer of it; nor any works at all in commutative Juſtice, making the reward to be of debt for the value of the works, and not of free grace; but that Juſtification muſt needs be of Gods free gift, and therefore by the Merits of our Redeemer; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that a <hi>fiducial accepting practical Belief</hi> of Gods free Gift, Covenant or Promiſe, of Grace and Glory, for, in, and with Chriſt, is the condition on our part (to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by his Grace) which is our Moral Qualification, or receptive diſpoſition, on which God by his Covenant giveth us right to the foreſaid free Gifts (Chriſts Grace and Glory.) This Faith <hi>Paul</hi> never deſcribed by ſome one ſingle Phyſical act of the Soul, but as a Moral act of the man; as we uſe the Word in humane converſe: As if one ſay, if you will truſt me as your Phyſician, I will cure you, if you take me for your Tutor, I will teach you; Here to <hi>truſt</hi> or <hi>take</hi> him, ſignifieth a <hi>conſenting truſt,</hi> to be <hi>medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cined</hi> and to be <hi>taught</hi> by ſuch a one. If one ſay to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned Beggar, truſt me and I will give thee a Lord-ſhip in a Foreign Land; it ſignifieth a <hi>truſt conſenting practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally</hi> to go with him and truſt his Convoy, and forſake his own Country. And <hi>James</hi> never queſtioned this Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine; But ſome <hi>Vain Men</hi> (as <hi>James</hi> calls them) miſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand this and ſpin us out a Web of their own <hi>Vanity,</hi> &amp; feign it to be <hi>Paul's</hi> Doctrine. 1. They ſay that <hi>Paul</hi> by <hi>Faith</hi> meaneth not <hi>Faith,</hi> by which we are ſaid to be juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, but only Chriſt, (who doubtleſs is a chief object of that Faith.) 2. That God the Father, or the Holy Ghoſt, are none of the object of Faith as it is juſtifying. 3. That it is not Chriſt himſelf, as Prophet or King, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as Prieſt that is this object. 4. That it is not all Chriſts Prieſt-hood, but only <hi>Sacrifice</hi> and <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> that is this object, and not his Heavenly Interceſſion. 5. that it is not Chriſts Sacrifice and Righteouſneſs as meerly merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious of our Pardon and Life, but as it was <hi>paid</hi> and <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed</hi> by Chriſt as our ſurety in our Legal Reputative Perſon, and ſo is imputed to us as our own, becauſe done by another in our name and ſtead, as one payeth a debt by another that was bound for him. 6. That ſo far as <hi>Faith</hi> is here meant, it is but one ſingle Phyſical act of Faith in <hi>Specie:</hi> and there they are utterly diſagreed. 1. Whether it be an act of the underſtanding, or will, or both? 2. Whether one act can be the belief of many objects, <hi>viz.</hi> of Chriſts Sacrifice, Obedience, Promiſe, Pardon, Heaven? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 7. Yea many ſay that it is but one individual act that we are juſtified by (which no mortal man can know, the individuation of the Souls acts being obſcure and the objects being always many conjunct) and they ſay that it is only our firſt act of Faith, and that all following acts of the ſame <hi>ſpecies,</hi> finding us juſtified, cannot juſtifie us any more than works. 8. They ſay that Faith juſtifieth only as an Inſtrumental Cauſe, and not as a Moral qualifying receptive <hi>condition</hi> or diſpoſition. 9. They ſay that believing in the Father &amp; the Holy Ghoſt, and hoping for Heaven, and praying for Mercy; and Repenting of Sin, and Loving God and our Saviour, and his Word and Saints, and Thankfulneſs for Grace, and Obedience to Chriſt, and Patience and forſaking all for him, are the works which <hi>Paul</hi> meaneth to exclude from Juſtification, and ſo is Faith in Chriſts Righteouſneſs as an Act, but not as an Inſtrument. 10. They are utterly diſagreed whether Faith juſtifie by appropriating only Chriſts active Righteouſneſs, or alſo his Paſſive, or alſo his Divine Righteouſneſs and Perfection. 11. They ſay that by [<hi>Imputing Faith</hi> for <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi>] is meant that not our <hi>Faith,</hi> but <hi>Chriſts Righteouſneſs, is Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted in it ſelf</hi> (and not its merited effects only) to be our own, becauſe we performed it by him. 12. They ſay that it is the very Law of Innocency and Works that juſtifieth us, as having perfectly fulfilled it in and by Chriſt. 13. they <hi>(moſt)</hi> hold that in Chriſt we have both perfectly kept the Law, from birth till death, by imputed obedience, and yet ſatisfied for not keeping it by his ſufferings, as if perfect obedience imputed could conſiſt ith ſin. 14. They ſay that Gods corrections are no puniſhments becauſe elſe Chriſts Suffering was inſufficient, and God ſhould puniſh one ſin twice. 15. And that our pardon and juſtification is perfect as ſoon as we believe. 16. And that no more is needful to our continued Juſtification, than to its beginning. 17. And that yet more is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to our Salvation than to our final Juſtification. Many ſuch humane Inventions man's brain hath ſpun out, and made a Doctrine of their own, and called it <hi>Paul</hi>'s.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>James,</hi> having to do with carnal Goſpellers, that thought to be ſaved for being of a right Opinion, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling this, Faith, doth 1. Tell them that this is not that true Chriſtian Faith which hath the promiſe of Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and Salvation, but that that is a powerful, practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal belief and truſt. 2. Therefore their Doing that which Faith conſents and engageth them to do, muſt juſtifie that Faith to be ſound, which muſt juſtifie them as the condition of life. 3. And that therefore this <hi>Efficiency</hi> or <hi>Doing</hi> of this <hi>practical Faith,</hi> is part of the condition of their Juſtifications, and it juſtifieth the <hi>man himſelf,</hi> 1. As it juſtifieth his Faith, and ſo juſtifieth him to be a ſound Believer, and not an Infidel or Hypocrite. 2. In that the effectual, operative nature, and conſent to obey, is eſſential to that Faith it ſelf. 3. In that as a Faith ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting Chriſt, and conſenting to obey him as the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of Eternal Salvation, is the condition of our firſt entring into a ſtate of Life and Juſtification, ſo our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of that conſent by ſincere obedience and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance, is the condition of our Juſtification, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued and conſummate at Judgment, and ſo of our final Salvation. 4. In that ſincere Holineſs and Obedience is the very matter that muſt juſtifie men, againſt the <hi>virtual</hi> or <hi>actual</hi> accuſation of Satan, that they were not <hi>holy</hi> and <hi>obedient,</hi> but ungodly or hypocrites: As <hi>Faith</hi> it ſelf is the matter of our Juſtification againſt the accuſation, that we were not Believers. Now <hi>James</hi> ſpeaketh of no other Faith than <hi>Paul</hi> doth: But 1. He ſpeaketh of another thing under the name of [<hi>Works.</hi>] 2. And he ſpeaketh of a <hi>working Nature</hi> in Faith for our Juſtification begun, and of the Deeds <hi>themſelves,</hi> as needful to its continuance. And, in a word, he ſpeaketh of ſuch Juſtification by no

               <p n="1">1. MY brethren, be not many maſters, knowing that we ſhall receive the greater condemnation.</p>
               <p rend="small">1. And as I thus admoniſh you againſt the Errour of Hypocrites, who take their dead Opinions and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions for a Juſtifying Faith; ſo muſt I do againſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Vice, which that ſort of Hypocrites are guilty of: Their Pride and Self-conceit maketh them think that their knowledge is much higher than other Chriſtians; and that they are the fitteſt men to be Teaching Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and Reprovers; and ſo they are all forwarder to Teach, and Magiſterially Cenſure others, and uſe their Tongue to contemn others as ſhort of them in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and to boaſt of themſelves; and all their Talk runs in a Teaching, and not a Learning way. But I warn you to avoid this proud and maſterly ſpirit; for it will make your ſin the greater, and without excuſe, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe your condemnation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For in many things we offend all. If any man offend not in word, the ſame is a perfect man, and able alſo to bridle the whole body.</p>
               <p rend="small">2. Your zeal goeth out by cenſuring others, as great ſinners in compariſon of you (perhaps for not obſerving your Ceremonies and Traditions, or not taking you for their Teaching Maſters;) But fear ſin in your ſelves; yea, leſt your cenſorious, reproachful, unbridled Tongues, ſhould prove worſe than that which you cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure others for. He that hath moſt power to rule his Tongue, and ſinneth not in words, is like to be the moſt perfect Chriſtian, and can rule his actions by the ſame Obedience and Wiſdom which doth rule his Tongue.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Behold, we put bitts in the horſes mouths, that they may obey us, and we turn about their whole body.</p>
               <p rend="small">3. As we rule the whole bodies of Horſes by a Bridle in the mouth; ſo, could you bridle your mouths it would both ſignifie a power to rule your lives, and much promote, this.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Behold alſo the ſhips, which though they be ſo great, and are driven of fierce winds, yet are they turned about with a very ſmall helm, whitherſoever the gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour liſteth.</p>
               <p rend="small">4. So the Pilot by ſo ſmall a thing as the Helm, ruleth great Ships, that are under the force of Winds.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Even ſo the tongue is a little mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and boaſteth great things:</p>
               <p rend="small">5. And man's Tongue is but a ſmall part of the body, though it boaſt great things; and the Government of that little member, is a great part of the Government of the man.</p>
               <p n="5">5, 6. Behold how great a matter a little fire kindleth: And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity: ſo is the tongue amongſt our members, that it defileth the whole body, and ſetteth on fire the courſe of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and it is ſet on fire of hell.</p>
               <p rend="small">5 6. The Tongue in the body, and the World, is like fire among much combuſtible matter. As a little fire kindleth much; ſo this little member doth both kindle defiling paſſions and guilt in our own bodies, and alſo kindle hatred, rage and ſtrife in the World, and ſet on fire the Societies and Affairs of Mankind in the World, being it ſelf ſet on fire by the Devil, and uſed by helliſh temptations, to helliſh deſigns in diabolical employment.</p>
               <p n="7">7. For every kind of beaſts and of birds, and of ſerpents, and things in the ſea, is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and hath been tamed of mankind: 8. But the tongue can no man tame,</p>
               <p rend="small">7, 8. For all ſorts of Animals have been maſtered by Man: But the Tongue of another who can maſter? [when we have ſo much ado to ſubdue our own.]</p>
               <p n="8">8, 9. <hi>It is</hi> an unruly evil, full of deadly poiſon. Therewith bleſs we God, even the Father; and therewith curſe we men, which are made after the ſimilitude of God. 10. Out of the ſame mouth proceedeth bleſſing and curſing:</p>
               <p rend="small">8, 9. It is to us, and in the World, an unruly evil, (till Grace ſhall tame it) and infecteth our ſelves and the ſocieties where we live, with the mortal Poiſon of many great ſins. The ſame Hypocrites, who praiſe God and worſhip him with it, do reproach their Brethren with it; not only Men that have ſome of Gods Image in their natural faculties, but thoſe that are Gods true Servants, better than themſelves, who are renewed to Gods Image in Holineſs by Grace.</p>
               <p n="10">10. 11. My brethren, theſe things ought not ſo to be. Doth a fountain ſend forth at the ſame place ſweet <hi>water</hi> and bitter? 12. Can a fig-tree, my brethren, bear olive-berries? either a vine figs? ſo <hi>can</hi> no fountain both yield ſalt water and freſh.</p>
               <p rend="small">10, 11, 12. Do you not perceive that your ill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachful Tongues, which vilifie, ſpeak evil of and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn, good Chriſtians for not being of your minds, do confute themſelves, when the ſame Tongues profeſs to honour God, and boaſt of Wiſdom and Religion in your ſelves: If you were as Wiſe and Godly, as you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, your Tongues would not, by ſpeaking ill of your Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, ſhew the contrary. No Fountain ſends forth ſweet water and bitter, freſh and ſalt, no Fig tree brings ſorth Olives; The tree is known by its fruits.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Who is a wiſe man and endued with
<pb facs="tcp:66325:258"/>
knowledge amongſt you? let him ſhew out of a good converſation his works with meekneſs of wiſdom.</p>
               <p rend="small">13. Are any among you, indeed, as much wiſer and knowing and excelling others, as you would be thought when you cenſure or deſpiſe them: Shew it if you would have any wiſe man believe you, not by proud boaſting or talking againſt others, but by the true fruits of the Spirit, even a better converſation than theirs in all your deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and by more good works, with that humble meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which ſignifieth true Wiſdom.</p>
               <p n="14">14. But if ye have bitter envying and ſtrife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not againſt the truth, 15. This wiſdom deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not from above, but <hi>is</hi> earthly, ſenſual, deviliſh,</p>
               <p rend="small">14, 15. But if you have a bitter Zeal, and envy and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable heart-riſing and ſtrife againſt your Brethren; pretending truth, Orthodoxneſs, or Religion for your ſwelling envy and emulation, and talking and preaching down Love and Peace, to make thoſe that differ from your ſide, to ſeem hateful, or contemptuous, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of you, your profeſſion of greater knowledge and religiouſneſs, is but proud boaſting, and lying againſt the truth: This Wiſdom, and this Preaching and Courſe, is not of God, not ſuch as he will own. It is from an earthly, and ſenſual Principle, your own praiſe, or profit, or Magiſterial will, or ſome carnal intereſt is at the root; if you could know your ſelves you might ſee this: Yea it is ſo far from excelling others, that it is a deviliſh Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, a Deviliſh Zeal, and Deviliſh Preaching and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting, which you glory in.</p>
               <p n="16">16. For where envying and ſtrife is, there is confuſion, and every evil work.</p>
               <p rend="small">16. For where envious Zeal and Strife prevail, there is ſtill Faction and unquietneſs, (or Sedition, Tumults and unſetledneſs ſtill for change;) and this cheriſheth all ſorts of evil works, which men will think to be all good or lawful, to ſerve their contentious Zeal and to further their changes and carnal ends.</p>
               <p n="17">17. But the wiſdom that is from above is firſt pure, then peaceable, gentle, <hi>and</hi> eaſie to be intreated, full of mercy &amp; good fruits, without partiality, and without hyprocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie. 18. And the fruit of righteouſneſs is ſown in peace of them that make peace.</p>
               <p rend="small">17, 18. But if you would know among the ſeveral pretenders, whoſe knowledge, and religiouſneſs, and zeal is from above, the fruit of the Spirit, which God will own? Theſe are the ſure marks of it. 1. It is firſt for true purity of heart and life: It will not chuſe ſin, on any pretence, ſo far as men can know it. If any be for wilful, deliberate conformity to ſin, or for a looſe and ſenſual life, or againſt ſerious godlineſs, and a holy, heavenly, ſober and juſt life, this is not from the Spirit of God. 2. It is next to this, addicted to peace, and will ſeek it by all lawful means. 3. It is addicted to put the beſt ſenſe of another man's caſe, and to a gentle, and not a rigid, cenſorious Judgment. 4. Eaſily yielding to good perſuaſions, and not ſtiff in ill Opinions or ways. 5. Full of mercy to others, and of all good works or fruits to his power, as being devoted to do good. 6. Without cenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious partiality, as Sectaries, that can ſee nothing but what ſeemeth to make for their own Party and Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, (or, without a wavering unreſolvedneſs in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion.) 7. Without Hypocriſie, or falſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendings. And though the erroneous and contentious in both extreams, do uſe to vilifie or abhor Peace-makers, who ſerve God according to this ſupernal Wiſdom, yet theſe men, who labour to make peace, are ſowing, in this work of peace, the fruit of true Righteouſneſs, as guiltleſs of the crimes of the extream contenders, and of the tumults cauſed by them: And when the Harveſt of God's Judgment cometh, they ſhall reap this fruit to themſelves: And if the Countreys, where they live, are worthy of ſuch fruit, they muſt reap it from this ſeed of peace-making labours.</p>

               <p n="1">1. FRom whence <hi>come</hi> wars and fightings among you? <hi>come they</hi> not hence, <hi>even</hi> of your luſts, that war in your mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers?</p>
               <p rend="small">1. The Jews are in frequent Seditions and fightings among themſelves, in which many erroneous Chriſtians joyn with the unbelievers, in a blind Zeal for their Law and Nation. And do you think it is from true Zeal that their Wars ariſe? No, it is from their own ſenſual, worldly luſts, that firſt war in themſelves, and then di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb the common peace.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Ye luſt, and have not: ye kill, and deſire to have, and cannot obtain: ye fight and war, yet ye have not, becauſe ye ask not.</p>
               <p rend="small">2. You Covet, and fight, and kill, in your miſtaken deſires of your Law and Liberties; and you do but loſe your blood and labour, by going your own ſinful way, and not ſeeking to God for Counſel, conduct and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, who muſt give all good, and that in his own way.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Ye ask, and receive not; becauſe ye ask amiſs, that you may conſume it upon your luſts.</p>
               <p rend="small">3. Yea you will be Religious in your ſin, and make your Prayers to God for deliverance from the <hi>Roman</hi> Power, and for your Countrys Liberty. But they are carnal Prayers; and God rejecteth them; for it is but that you may live in great Plenty, Power and Pleaſure, enjoying ſenſual proſperity, that you pray to God for your deliverance.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Ye adulterers, and adultereſſes, know ye not that the friendſhip of the world is enmity with God? whoſoever therefore will be a friend of the world, is the enemy of God.</p>
               <p rend="small">4 You that by your perfidiouſneſs to God, are like perfidious adulterers, loving the World beſt, whilſt
<pb facs="tcp:66325:258"/>
God is in your mouths, know ye not that this love of the World, as his Competitor, is enmity to God, and that he is God's Enemy that ſo loveth it predominantly?</p>
               <p n="5">5. Do ye think that the ſcripture ſaith in vain, The ſpirit that dwelleth in us luſteth to envie?</p>
               <p rend="small">5. Is it not true, which the Scripture ſaith, of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil inclination of Mans Heart, as luſting after worldly Pomp and Pleaſure, and to envy and ſtrife, that they may obtain it?</p>
               <p n="6">6. But he giveth more grace, wherefore he ſaith, God reſiſteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble.</p>
               <p rend="small">6. But Gods Grace is of a contrary tendency, and would teach you better things; but he giveth it to the humble, and not to the proud, for he is againſt ſuch, as its ſaid, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Submit your ſelves therefore to God: reſiſt the devil, and he will flee from you.</p>
               <p rend="small">7. If ye would be delivered and live in ſafety, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit your ſelves to Gods Government and Will, and go the way which he preſcribeth: Conquer Satan, and you need not fear his forces, and do but reſolutely reſiſt him, and you conquer him.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you: cleanſe your hands, ye ſinners, and purifie your hearts ye double-minded. 9. Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to heavineſs, 10. Humble your ſelves in the ſight of the Lord, and he ſhall lift you up.</p>
               <p rend="small">8, 9, 10. Draw nigh to that God againſt whom you have rebelled, and he will draw nigh to you for your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance, and will not forſake you. Cleanſe your hands by Reformation from your ſins, and your hearts from your halting between God and the World: Bewail your former ſin, by ſelf-afflicting mourning and weeping. Turn your ſenſual pleaſures into godly ſorrow, and your carnal mirth into penitent tears: Humble your ſelves before that God whom you have offended, and then he will lift you up, and ſave you better than your Seditions.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Speak not evil one of another (bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren) he that ſpeaketh evil of his brother, and judgeth his brother, ſpeaketh evil of the law, and judgeth the law: but if thou judge the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge.</p>
               <p rend="small">11. And give over your reproach and cenſoriouſneſs againſt the Gentile Chriſtians, that do not obſerve your Ceremonial Law, by which you encourage their Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors; for both the <hi>Law</hi> of Chriſt, and the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> which you profeſs to own, do bid you love your Neighbour as your ſelf, and forbid ſuch uncharitable cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; ſo that by condemning your Brethren, you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the Law: And this is not to keep either <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law or Chriſt's, but to ſet your ſelves above both, by making your ſelves Reproving Judges of them.</p>
               <p n="12">12. There is one Law-giver, who is able to ſave, and to deſtroy: who art thou that judgeſt another?</p>
               <p rend="small">12. Chriſt, and none elſe (ſaith Dr. <hi>H.</hi>) hath Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to give Laws to us: There is but one Law-giver, who hath the abſolute and final power of life and death eternal, Salvation and Damnation. Who art thou that dareſt arrogate this Judgment? Or what power haſt thou to judge or anathematize another, any further than truly to tell men whom Chriſt will judge and caſt away?</p>
               <p n="13">13. Go to now, ye that ſay, To day or to morrow we will go into ſuch a city, and continue there a year, and buy and ſell, and get gain: 14. Whereas ye know not what <hi>ſhall be</hi> on the morrow: for what is your life? it is even a vapour that appeareth for a little time, and then vaniſheth away.</p>
               <p rend="small">13, 14. You are too much ſet on wordly proſperity; and you plot for gain, as if you were ſecured of long a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode on Earth; and you lay your deſigns with preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous confidence, where and how long you will dwell, trade and gain, when as your Life on Earth is a meer uncertain fugitive vapour, quickly gone,</p>
               <p n="15">15. For that ye ought to ſay, If the Lord will we ſhall live, and do this, or that. 16. But now ye rejoyce in your boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: all ſuch rejoycing is evil.</p>
               <p rend="small">15, 16. Whereas ye ſhould remember the uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty and ſhortneſs of your lives, and deſign and do all in ſubmiſſive dependance on the will of God: But you fetch your comfort from wordly things by your own vain preſumption of long Life, and hope of worldly proſperity: all ſuch preſumptuous carnal comforts are evil.</p>
               <p n="17">17. Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doth it not, to him it is ſin.</p>
               <p rend="small">17. And the brevity of Mans Life, and the vanity of worldly gain, are things ſo notorious and undeniable to all men, eſpecially to Chriſtians, that to let theſe vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties looſen you from Chriſt and your obedience, is ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly unexcuſeable.</p>

               <p rend="small">
                  <hi>Note.</hi> 1. An impenitent man is unfit for Pardon, and therefore, for deliverance from puniſhment: and he that doth not penitently confeſs and bewail his ſin, cannot be judged a true Penitent; and therefore cannot be prayed for with that Faith and Hope as we may do for the Penitent. 2. This is not to be a cuſtomary thing, or only to a Prieſt, but it's a duty both in Sickneſs and Health, wherever the expreſſion of Repentance to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers is a duty. By which alas, we know how rare true Repentance is, when even profeſſors of Zeal in Religion are ſharp in cenſuring and blaming others; and except a very few humble Souls, if they be never ſo juſtly blamed or reproved, do ſwell againſt the reprover with pride and indignation as if he were their Enemy: And they that ſeparate from the Churches for want of Diſcipline, are earneſt for it for others, but cannot bear it on themſelves; nor ſo much as endure a confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of their errors, but take him to ſpeak againſt Godlineſs, who ſpeaketh againſt their miſtakes and faults; and two many (like the Prophane) will turn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain and all to rend him.</p>
               <p n="17">17. Elias was a man ſubject to like paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions as we are, and he prayed earneſtly that it might not rain: and it rained not on the earth by the ſpace of three years and ſix months. 18. And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth brought forth her fruit.</p>
               <p rend="small">17, 18. Think not that Prayer is a vain or unef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual thing, though we be frail and faulty men: <hi>Elias</hi> was but a man, liable both to ſufferings, and to a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled mind in them; as we are; yet on his earneſt Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, it rained not on an Idolatrous Perſecuting Country for three years and a half; and at his Prayer, it rained again, and the Land was fruitful.</p>

I beſeech you, Brethren, be neither negligent or diſpairing to the cure of men in error, nor yet impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with thoſe that would detect your Errors, and convince you and bring you to Repentance (as proud impenitent Perſons are:) But know that (as all men, alas are too prone to error) if any man err from the truth (through ignorance or a corrupted will,) and one convert him, he that converteth a ſinner from his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror in mind or life, doth not only do that which tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to ſave his life from Gods puniſhing ſtroak, but alſo ſhall ſave his Soul from everlaſting death, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the Pardon of his manifold ſin, not only ſo far that the Church, but God himſelf, ſhall receive him into a reconciled ſtate.</p>

               <p n="1">1. LIkewiſe, ye wives, be in ſubjection to your own husbands, that if any obey not the word, they alſo may without the word be won by the converſation of the wives:</p>
               <p rend="small">1. And though Wives be not Servants, yet a loving ſubjection and obedience to their Huſbands is their duty; ſo that if their Huſbands be unbelievers, and are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted by Miniſters preaching, yet the converſation of their Wives may be ſuch as may convince them of the goodneſs of Religion, and may win them to a liking of the Word, till by it they are fully converted.</p>
               <p rend="small">
                  <hi>Note</hi>; This winning converſation of Wives, is, their excelling all other ſorts of Women in love, pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, meekneſs, patience, humility, diligence in educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Children, in holineſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p rend="small">2. While they ſee your pure and chaſt converſation, joyned with the true fear of God (or reverence to them.)</p>
               <p n="3">3. Whoſe adorning, let it not be that outward <hi>adorning,</hi> of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, and of putting on of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel:</p>
               <p rend="small">3. And do not inordinately mind that ſort of adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which conſiſteth in following the faſhions of proud, vain or laſcivious perſons, ſuch as plaiting or knotting the Hair, and wearing Ornaments of Gold, to make you ſeem rich, or extraordinarily comely; and coſtlineſs, neatneſs or curioſity of Apparel.</p>
               <p rend="small">
                  <hi>Note</hi>; That the thing forbidden, is the ſignifying of a vain, proud, procacious, tempting mind, and the imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of ſuch vain perſons: And that the Rule to be obſerved in Apparel by the rich, is to chuſe, 1. That which is beſt for bodily health, as warm and ſuitable. 2. Leaſt hindering, and moſt uſeful for labour and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs. 3. Decent, without curioſity, or too much coſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs. 4. Not ſcandalous, either imitating thoſe above our rank, or humorouſly and ſordidly ſingular, but imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the graveſt of our own age and rank. 5. But the command of a Huſband, though he ſhould be miſtaken, may oblige a Wife or Child to ſomewhat differing from their own inclination or judgment. 6. And young per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons deſiring Marriage, may go further adorning than graver Women, ſo they deceive none thereby.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But <hi>let it be</hi> the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, <hi>even the ornament</hi> of a meek and quiet ſpirit, which is in the ſight of God of great price.</p>
               <p rend="small">4. But labour to excel in that which is the trueſt and preciouſeſt ornament, which is the New Creature of a right frame of heart, which is not like beauty, or appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, or gold, a corruptible thing; and ſpecially a humble, meek and quiet ſpirit, void of pride, and paſſion, and of an unquiet mind, that troubleth it ſelf, and thoſe that are about ſuch; that is hardly pleaſed, nor can live plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſingly to others, but keep themſelves, and their Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, in diſcontent, and uncomfortable trouble. God is the Judge of our amiableneſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whom you muſt ſpecially pleaſe: And he highly valueth this meek and quiet ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</p>
               <p n="5">5. For after this manner in the old time, the holy women alſo who truſted in God adorned themſelves, being in ſubjection unto their own husbands.</p>
               <p rend="small">5. This was the chief adorning of thoſe holy Women, whoſe praiſes you read of in the Scripture, who truſted in God, being in reverent and loving ſubjection to their Huſbands.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Even as Sara obeyed Abraham, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him lord, whoſe daughters ye are as long as ye do well, and are not afraid with any amazement.</p>
               <p rend="small">6. And thus <hi>Sarah,</hi> the believing Wife of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the Father of the Faithful, obeyed and reverenced her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and ſpake of him as her ſuperiour; and you will be the Daughters and Succeſſors of her Faith and Bleſſing, as long as you do well, and are obedient to God and your Huſbands, and give not way to thoſe vexatious, cauſeleſs fears, which your Sex is much liable to, and which ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie too little truſt in God, eſpecially when they would fright you from your duty.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Likewiſe ye husbands, dwell with them according to knowledge, giving ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour unto the wife as unto the weaker veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, and as being heirs together of the grace of life, that your prayers be not hindred.</p>
               <p rend="small">7. And you, Huſbands, muſt dwell with them, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemeth thoſe that ſhould teach and guide them, and therefore ſhould excel them in knowledge, and help to edifie them; and becauſe their parts are ſuppoſed to be lower than yours, do not contemn them for it, but contribute your Authority and Wiſdom to maintain their honour, and keep them from being contemned by Children or Servants; as being ſo nearly united, that you ſhould live together as joynt Heirs of all the mercies of God, for this life, and a better; that ſo, in this concord, you may daily pray together, as with one mind and mouth, and that diſcord and diſcontent unfit you not for ſuch united prayers.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Finally, <hi>be ye</hi> all of one mind, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing compaſſion one of another, love as bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, be pitiful, be courteous: 9. Not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing: but contrariwiſe bleſſing, knowing that ye are thereunto called, that ye ſhould inherit a bleſſing.</p>
               <p rend="small">8. Yea, let all Chriſtians be of one mind, and live in concord, not exagitating, but compaſſionating, each others infirmities and ſufferings, loving as Chriſtian Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren ought; pitiful to thoſe that need you, and humble and courteous to all; not hurting thoſe that hurt you,
<pb facs="tcp:66325:262"/>
nor railing at thoſe that rail at you, as if you might law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully revenge evil with evil; but contrarily, bleſs thoſe, and give them good words, who give you evil ones: For Chriſt by his Word, Example and Mercys, hath cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and obliged you to this, that you may be bleſt of God.</p>
               <p n="10">10. For he that will love life, and ſee good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they ſpeak no guile. 11. Let him eſchew evil and do good, let him ſeek peace, and enſue it.</p>
               <p rend="small">10, 11. For as it is ſaid, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34. <hi>He that will love life,</hi> &amp;c. Seeing you love life, and would live in peace and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the likelieſt means to attain this, is 1. To keep your Tongues from ſpeaking evil of any man, and from all other evil; 2. And from falſhood, deceit and diſſimulation, (for it is mens own unbridled Tongues which bring moſt of their troubles on them, and falſe words that hide faults, at laſt detected, expoſe men more.) 3. Avoid all real evil, and then your Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs will appear through the V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And do all the good you can to all men, as well as your immediate Duty to God: And Nature hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a love to ſuch as do us good, and a reverence of God, ſuch good works, and well doing, will powerfully juſtifie you in the Conſciences of moſt men. 5. And ſtand not contentiouſly on your right, but whatever men are or do, ſeek peace with all; and be not ſoon weary, but fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low after it ſtill in hope.</p>
               <p n="12">12. For the eyes of the Lord <hi>are</hi> over the righteous, and his ears <hi>are open</hi> unto their prayers: but the face of the Lord <hi>it</hi> againſt them that do evil.</p>
               <p rend="small">12. And this is not meer policy to pleaſe men, but whatever they be, it is God that your lives and peace depend on; and he that commandeth this, is pleaſed with it; and his Eyes watch over you for good, to ſave you from unreaſonable men, and he heareth their prayers in all diſtreſs; while evil ſpeakers and doers, God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is more againſt, than men.</p>
               <p n="13">13. And who is he that will harm you if ye be followers of that which is good?</p>
               <p rend="small">13. If your Zeal in Religion be a Zeal of <hi>good works,</hi> to ſet your ſelves earneſtly, as to obey God, ſo to do good to all men; he muſt be a very impious and diabolical man, that will for this ſett againſt you: It is the likelieſt way to your quietneſs.</p>
               <p n="14">14. But and if ye ſuffer for righteouſneſs ſake, happy <hi>are ye,</hi> and be not afraid of their terrour, neither be troubled:</p>
               <p rend="small">14. But I confeſs ſuch blinded, unreaſonable, malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Slaves and Executioners Satan hath, that will perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute you, even for Righteouſneſs ſake: But this is the way to, and prognoſtick of your reward and happineſs: And therefore let not mens threats, rage, or cruelty, terrifie or trouble you, ſeeing you ſhall be unſpeakably gainers by it.</p>
               <p n="15">15. But ſanctifie the Lord God in your hearts, and <hi>be</hi> ready always to give an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to every man that asketh you a reaſon of the hope that is in you, with meekneſs and fear:</p>
               <p rend="small">15. But let God always be in your hearts with the higheſt reſpect, obedience and honour, and be ſtill fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with thoſe Reaſons of your Faith and Hope, that you may be ready to profeſs them, and to give a good account of them to any that demandeth it; and this with meekneſs and due reverence to Superiors, and not with paſſionate upbraiding them, or with diſdain.</p>
               <p n="16">16. Having a good conſcience, that whereas they ſpeak evil of you, as of evil doers, they may be aſhamed that falſly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe your good converſation in Chriſt.</p>
               <p rend="small">16. Keeping your Conſciences clear from guilt, that they may juſtifie you when men accuſe you; and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as men ſlander you as bad men, and ſeditious and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaceable, your good converſation, according to Chriſt's Law and Example, may ſhame their falſe accuſations, (a better defence than bare words, and diſputing with them.)</p>
               <p n="17">17. For it is better, if the will of God be ſo, that ye ſuffer for well-doing, than for evil doing.</p>

Whereas there are of late many Hereſies ſprung up about the Perſon, Doctrine and Works of Chriſt, I ſhall declare to you, that which was from the beginning (his Godhead, or ſay others, that of him which was decreed from Eternity, or as others, that which is true of him from his beginning or Incarnation) and [that ſame Chriſt whom we have heard and ſeen with our Eyes, and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on, and our Hands have handled, even the Humane Body of Chriſt the Word of Life.] Or as others, [that Goſpel which we have heard, that Perſon, and thoſe Works which we have ſeen, and him whom we have handled, as theſe concern the Goſpel of life.]</p>

For Chriſt, who is Life in himſelf, and the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Life to us, was manifeſted in fleſh, and we have ſeen him, and bear witneſs, and preach to you the Eternal Divine Life and Nature of Chriſt, which was eternally one with the Father, and was manifeſt to us.</p>

I ſay, we declare to you that of Chriſt, which we our ſelves have ſeen and heard, that ſo what we had by ſeeing and hearing, you may have from our Teſtimony, who have ſeen and heard Chriſt himſelf; and ſo you may by our communication partake of the ſame Faith and Grace, as we our ſelves do, and may continue in our Communion; and that is no other then to have the ſame Father and Saviour, from, and with whom it is that we have communication and communion, and not to turn from them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And theſe things write we unto you that your joy may be full.</p>
               <p rend="small">4. And the end of my writing this to you, is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleating of your own Joy and Salvation.</p>
               <p n="5">5. This then is the meſſage which we have heard of him, and declare unto you, that God is light, and in him is no darkneſs at all.</p>
               <p rend="small">5. The firſt and great part of Chriſt's Doctrine, and our Meſſage, is to teach us to know God himſelf; and firſt, that he is <hi>Light,</hi> and in him is no darkneſs at all.</p>
               <p rend="small">
                  <hi>Note</hi> 1. The Apoſtle telling us what God is, ſpeaketh in the Abſtract, to let us know that it is his <hi>Eſſence</hi>; and not a meer Accident that he meaneth. And as God's Image in Man's Soul hath three eſſentiating faculties, <hi>Vitality, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding</hi> and <hi>Will,</hi> which are eminently <hi>ſelf-motions, Light</hi> and <hi>Heat,</hi> or reſembled by theſe; ſo God is here called LIFE, <hi>v.</hi> 1. LIGHT, <hi>v.</hi> 5. and LOVE, <hi>c.</hi> 4, <hi>v.</hi> 8.</p>
               <p rend="small">2. When God is called LIGHT, it is ſpoken but metaphorically, and ſignifieth his KNOWLEDGE or WISDOM, as it is his Eſſence, and as <hi>Communicative,</hi> giving the Light of Knowledge to all that have it, and wiſely Ruling them by his Laws: And alſo the GLORY of this, and all his perfections, as refulgent to the Creature: For <hi>Glory</hi> and <hi>Light</hi> are oft the ſame in ſenſe. 3. When it is ſaid, <hi>There is no darkneſs in him,</hi> it meaneth, <hi>No Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance,</hi> nor <hi>Privation,</hi> nor <hi>

               <p rend="small">6, 7. If we ſay that we live in communion with God, and yet are in the Darkneſs of Unbelief, Ignorance, Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and Wickedneſs, we do but lie: But if we walk in the Light of holy Knowledge, Faith and Purity, we have mutual communion with God, and with his Son Jeſus Chriſt, whoſe Blood doth cleanſe us from all ſin.</p>

               <p rend="small">1, 2. I write to you as to Babes, who need help and confirmation, in your temptatious by Seducers, that you may not be drawn by them to take ſenſuality, or ſuch like evils, to be lawful, nor to live wilfully or impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently in any ſin: But if any man, contrary to the bent and tenor of his heart and life, be guilty of any ſin of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity, let him not deſpair, but flie to our Advocate with the Father Jeſus Chriſt, whoſe perfect Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs merited our Pardon: For he is the Propitiation for our ſins by virtue of his Sacrifice, now interceding for us in Heaven: And he is a Propitiation <hi>ſufficient</hi> for the ſins of the whole World (ſo far as that none of them ſhall be damned for want of a ſufficient Sacrifice, but only for want of accepting his Grace) and actually ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting the Pardon of all in the World, who believingly truſt and accept him and his Grace.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments.</p>
               <p rend="small">3.

               <p n="5">5. But whoſo keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God perfected: here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by know we that we are in him. 6. He that ſaith, he abideth in him, ought himſelf alſo ſo to walk, even as he walked.</p>
               <p rend="small">5, 6. But as true <hi>Faith</hi> worketh by <hi>Love,</hi> ſo doth <hi>Love</hi> by <hi>Obedience</hi>; and it is they that keep his Word, in whom the Love of God doth ſhew its ſoundneſs and perfection. We cannot bear fruit, unleſs we are <hi>in him</hi> as the branches in the Vine. And it is by this fruit that we muſt know that we are in him. He that profeſſeth to be a Chriſtian, and in Chriſt muſt walk as Chriſt did (in Holineſs, Love, Obedience and Patience.)</p>
               <p n="7">7. Brethren, I write no new command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unto you, but an old commandment, which ye had from the beginning: the old commandment is the word which ye have heard from the beginning.</p>
               <p rend="small">7. It is not novelty that I bring you, as Seducers do; but that ſame old Commandment which Chriſt and his Apoſtles preached when they firſt brought the Goſpel to the World: I call it <hi>Old,</hi> becauſe it is the Word which you heard from the beginning of Chriſtianity.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Again, a new commandment I write unto you, which thing is true in him, and in you, becauſe the darkneſs is paſt, and the true light now ſhineth.</p>
               <p rend="small">8. Yet it may be called <hi>a New Commandment</hi> which I write, as it is the Doctrine of Divine Love newly and more reſplendently ſhining forth in the work of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption by Chriſt; and there is true and juſt reaſon to call it new, both in Chriſt and in you: In Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is the newly incarnate, crucified, glorified de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of God's Love to Man, and the eminent Meſſenger of it, accordingly obliging to a new and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Love to God, and one another: And <hi>in you,</hi> becauſe, as you are renewed by, and to this ſpecial Love; ſo as new men you live therein: For the darkneſs of a life of malice and ungodlineſs is paſt, and the true Light now ſhining is ever accompanied, when it is effectual, with the Heats of Love and Obedience.</p>
               <p n="9">9. He that ſaith he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is in darkneſs, even un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till now.</p>

And no ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred to the ſin, and to the man as a ſinner, muſt caſt out our Love to him, ſo far as he is lovely. 4.

               <p n="15">15. Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.</p>
               <p rend="small">15. And I muſt accordingly warn you againſt the Love that is contrary to this Divine, Chriſtian Love; which is the carnal, inordinate Love of this World, and Worldly Intereſt and Things.

And they are very confident that <hi>John</hi> here meant no other than Chriſt himſelf meant in <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. and received his No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice from none but Chriſt, and that Chriſt's own words are the ſureſt Notification, who is the Antichriſt: For, it is mentioned here, not as a thing known only by ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Inſpiration to them, or the Apoſtles, but as a recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved former Prophecy; [<hi>As you have heard that Antichriſt ſhall come.</hi>] And which way did they hear it, but by the Apoſtles, as from Chriſt; whoſe words the Evangeliſts have not omitted?

And our Love is for this bleſſed effect, that we may joyfully now foreſee, and ſtand at laſt before him in Judgment, as the Lord, to whom by Love we are endeared and united: For as his Intereſt is deareſt to us in this World, and we obey and follow him in ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering; ſo it is that we may come to him in Glory, with whom our Life is now hid.</p>
               <p n="18">18. There is no fear in love, but perfect love caſteth out fear: becauſe fear hath torment: he that feareth, is not made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in love.</p>
               <p rend="small">18. For though our darkneſs and guilt would keep us under terror, leſt God ſhould deſtroy us, or our weakneſs make us fear the power of man, and bodily calamities and death, yet the Love that I ſpeak of, hath none of this terrour in it; but were it perfect, it would fully quiet the Soul, and caſt out all diſtruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, painful fear: For though cautelous preventing fear of all danger is neceſſary in this life to our ſafe avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing evil, and the awe and reverence of God is the duty of every creature; yet tormenting, or painful troubling fear cometh from diſtruſt, and ſheweth that our Love is yet imperfect.</p>
               <p rend="small">
                  <hi>Note</hi>; This is ſpoken both of tormenting fear of God and Man, of Hell and of Death, Sickneſſes and Croſſes here. For he that by Faith is fully perſuaded of God's great and ſpecial Love to him, ſuch as he hath manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Chriſt, and thereupon doth love God entirely above all, in that meaſure, cannot fear that ſuch a God will damn him, or leave him to the malice of Men or Devils, and by death it ſelf do him any hurt incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with deareſt Love. If Wives and Children fear not being murdered by loving Husbands or Fathers: perfect Love would make us fully quiet in our truſt in God. Painful fear of Hell, Death, Sickneſs, Poverty or Perſecutors, doth ſhew a diſtruſt and doubting of God's Love (who could ſure quickly ſave us by ſuch a word as made the World) and an imperfection of our Love to him as cauſed by this diſtruſt. Fear may ſtand with true Faith and Love, but not with perfect. Only I confeſs ſenſitive paſſion, through bodily diſeaſe or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, quite differing from rational Fear, is a Tyrant, which Faith and Reaſon will not overcome. As a man bound with Chains to the top of a Spire Steeple is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally ſure that he cannot fall, and yet is terrified with looking down.

               <p rend="small">19. And it is the knowledge of God's antecedent Love to us, giving us a Chriſt and Grace, and making us love him, which thus delivereth the Soul from fear, and turneth us to him with love and boldneſs: If his Love had been a meer dependent conſequent of ours, how uncertain ſhould we be of its continuance!</p>

               <p n="1">1. WHoſoever believeth that Jeſus is the Chriſt, is born of God: and every one that loveth him that begat, loveth him alſo that is begotten of him.</p>
               <p rend="small">1. <hi>Note</hi>; That it is believing <hi>God</hi> and not <hi>Man</hi> only, a Divine Faith, and not a Humane, a ſincere Faith, and not a doubting Opinion, that is here called [<hi>Believing,</hi>] Believing this on the word of our Rulers or Teachers is good, but it is but preparatory to Religion, and the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of God: And it is a matter of ſuch great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to believe it ſincerely as God's Word, that God was manifeſt in fleſh, and appointed Chriſt to the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and Work of Man's Sanctification and Salvation, that it is not poſſible but ſuch a ſound Belief muſt fill the Soul with love to God, and carry it up to a holy and heavenly ſtate, as the Regenerate are: Nor is it poſſible but ſuch ſhould love that Saviour, who is the Image of God's Love.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God, and keep his commandments. 3. For this is the love of God that we keep his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, and his commandments are not grievous.</p>
               <p rend="small">2, 3. And you muſt know, that it is not all Love to one another, or to good People that will prove us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate (for men may love them as their Friends, for loving them, or for being of their Opinion, Sect or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or for their Intereſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) But your love to men as God's Children is ſincere and ſaving, when it is God himſelf that you love moſt, and them for his ſake: And when his Love maketh you keep his Commandments. And his Commandments are not heavy, nor have any thing in them which men ſhould be unwilling to keep, but ſhould be both our work and pleaſure.</p>
               <p>4. For whatſoever is born of God, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith.</p>
               <p rend="small">4. God's Spirit is ſtronger than the evil Spirit that ruleth the ungodly World; and therefore all that are truly regenerate, do overcome the Love and Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of the World, though not perfectly, yet in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valency. And how do we overcome the World, but by firm believing in Jeſus Chriſt, and the Love of God, that will bring us to a far better World: The things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved prevail againſt the things ſeen, in all that are true Believers indeed.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jeſus is the Son of God?</p>
               <p rend="small">5. Where do you ſee any truly overcome the Love of this World, but they that believe that Jeſus Chriſt hath purchaſed, and promiſed, and will give them a better? And how elſe ſhould we overcame the World, but by believing in him that overcome it, and is preparing a place for us in Heaven, and hath made us the Heirs of Glory.</p>
               <p n="6">6. This is he that came by water and blood, even Jeſus Chriſt, not by water on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but by water and blood: and it is the Spirit that beareth witneſs, becauſe the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is truth.</p>
               <p rend="small">6. This is he that, as he was baptized, ſo he inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Baptiſm, for the cleanſing of Souls: And as he was crucified, to be a Sacrifice for ſin, ſo doth he, by his Sacrament and Grace, communicate this Sacrifice in its Benefits to us; which his Crucifixion ſignified, when both Water and Blood run out of his pierced Side. He cleanſeth us, nor by Water and Baptiſm alone, but as a Sacrifice, by Water and Blood, and at a dearer rate. And the Witneſs, by which God atteſteth all this to be his Truth, is, the Gift of his Spirit.</p>
               <p n="7">7. For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the holy Ghoſt: and theſe three are one. 8. And there are three that bear witneſs in earth, the Spirit, and the water, and the blood: and theſe three agree in one.</p>
               <p rend="small">7, 8. For there are three in Heaven, who have given us their Witneſs to the Goſpel on Earth; even, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who hath from Heaven declared Chriſt to be his Son: and the Word<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or Godhead of Chriſt, which he ſhewed in his Miracles, Reſurrection, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, ſent down for Infallibility, Miracles and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation of the Faithful. And theſe are ſo Three, as yet to be One. And on Earth, we have ſeen theſe three Witneſſes atteſting one thing by Agreement, even the Spirit in the Souls of Believers, in their Miracles and Holineſs ſealing the Truth; the Water of Baptiſm, and the waſhing of their Souls from Sin; and Chriſt's B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p rend="small">
                  <hi>Note</hi>; Though much of theſe words, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 7, 8. be not in many ancient Copies of the Bible, we have more reaſon to think that the <hi>Arrians</hi> left them out, than that the Orthodox put them in; (other Texts that aſſert Chriſt's Godhead being ſo uſed.) But however, it need not offend the Faithful, there being ſo many other Texts which aſſert the Trinity.</p>
               <p n="9">9. If we receive the witneſs of men, the

               <p rend="small">9. If the Witneſs of credible Men and Controverſies among us, much more muſt the Witneſs of God be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved: And this mentioned, is God's own Teſtimony of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="10">10. He that believeth on the Son of God, hath the witneſs in himſelf: he that belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth not God, hath made him a liar, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son.</p>
               <p rend="small">10. He that is a true Believer in Chriſt, hath the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Chriſt, which hath regenerated him: (for, if any man have not his Spirit, he is none of his.) And this Spirit of Power, Wiſdom and Holineſs, is moſt certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from God, and an infallible Evidence, that God own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Goſpel: therefore all theſe have the witneſſing Evidence of Chriſt in themſelves. And he that believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not ſo ſure a Teſtimony of God, doth make him a Lyer; as if he gave the Holy Spirit as a falſe Witneſs of Chriſt, to deceive the World.</p>
               <p n="11">11. And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life: and this life is in his Son. 12. He that hath the Son, hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God, hath not life.</p>
               <p rend="small">11, 12. And the ſum of the Goſpel, atteſted by God and his Spirit, is this; that <hi>God hath made a free Deed of Gift, of Pardon and Salvation to the World, even the Life of Grace and Glory; but ſo as that this Life is given us in and with Chriſt, who, with all theſe Benefits, is offered to Men, on condition of believing Acceptance:</hi> (As a Woman in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, hath the Man with his Eſtate; and as we chuſe our Phyſician for Phyſick, our Teacher for Learning, our Ruler for Government, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) He that hath Chriſt upon believing Acceptance, as his Saviour, hath Life initially, and Title to Salvation: And he that hath not Chriſt, through his Unbelief and Refuſal, hath not Life.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Theſe things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God, that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God.</p>
               <p rend="small">13. Theſe things I have written to you that are true Chriſtians, that you may know what a Treaſure you have in and with Chriſt; even, Right to Eternal Life, and its Beginning here: and that you may go on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, and conſtant in the Faith.</p>
               <p n="14">14. And this is the confidence that we have in him, that if we ask any thing ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his wiil, he heareth us.</p>
               <p rend="small">14. And through our Intereſt in Chriſt, his Merits and Interceſſion, we have ſufficient ground of Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that, by and through him, our Prayers are heard, and that he will give us whatever we ask, which he hath promiſed to give, and we are fit to receive.</p>
               <p n="15">15. And if we know that he hear us, whatſoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we deſired of him.</p>
               <p rend="small">15. And if he thus hear your Prayers, we may reckon that, in his time and way, he will give us whatever Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular we ask, if we and our Prayers be qualified for his Promiſe.</p>
               <p n="16">16. If any man ſee his brother ſin a ſin, <hi>which is</hi> not unto death, he ſhall ask, and he ſhall give him life for them that ſin not unto death. There is a ſin unto death: I do not ſay that he ſhall pray for it. 17. All unrighteouſneſs is ſin, and there is a ſin not unto death.</p>
               <p rend="small">16, 17. And this comfort you have, in your Prayers for others, as well as for your ſelves: God will hear you for thoſe, who are qualified for the Mercy which you beg for them, according to his Promiſe. Death, tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and eternal, is the Wages of ſin; but with great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference. There are many ſins of Infirmity, which we hate and ſtrive againſt; (as vain Thoughts, Words, Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, Coldneſs in Duty, Imperfection in all Good;) and all ſins that ſtand with true Repentance, and the predominant Love of God and Holineſs. Theſe the Law of Grace doth pardon, through Chriſt, and not damn any for: But Pardon muſt be asked, and ſhall be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, for the faithful, penitent, qualified perſon. But God hath told us, that he doth not pardon the Impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and Unſanctified, that had rather keep their ſin, than leave it; and are unqualified for Pardon. Your Prayer to God, to pardon ſuch, ſhall not prevail, while they are impenitent; much leſs for them that are Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels, and blaſpheme the Holy Ghoſt.

In this caſe, if one be to be executed by Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, or be under God's Juſtice, that will put him to death, you may pray for his Soul, but you muſt not pray for his Life, though he repent; becauſe it is againſt God's Law, and the common Good: And if you ſhould pray for the Recovery of ſuch a man in Sickneſs, God hath not promiſed you to recover him: No, nor any of his own Children, when their dying time is come.</p>
               <p n="18">18. We know that whoſoever is born of God, ſinneth not; but he that is begotten of God, keepeth himſelf, and that wicked one toucheth him not.</p>
               <p rend="small">18. We know that all that are born of God, hate ſin, and overcome it in the courſe of their lives; and live in no reigning ſin which is predominant, but only hated infirmities, which conſiſt with ſincere, predominant Faith, Obedience and Repentance, (nor have any ſin at all, ſo far as they have the Divine Nature;) but they watchfully keep themſelves from the prevalence of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan's ſnares.</p>

               <p n="1">1. THe revelation of Jeſus Chriſt, which God gave unto him, to ſhew unto his ſervants things which muſt ſhortly come to paſs; and he ſent and ſignified <hi>it</hi> by his angel unto his ſervant John:</p>
               <p rend="small">1. <hi>Note</hi> 1. It is eminently called the <hi>Revelation,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by <hi>Viſion</hi> and Prophetick notice an extraordinary Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of future things.</p>
               <p rend="small">2. <hi>Beza</hi> well obſerveth hence the Order of God's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation to his Church. Firſt, God himſelf is the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; he revealeth it to our Mediator, as Man, (who knoweth all things as God) that according to his Office he may be the Light and Teacher to his Church. Chriſt revealeth it to Angels; the Holy Ghoſt and Angels re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal it to Apoſtles and Prophets; they reveal and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord it to the Church, where all muſt learn it, but ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially Teachers, to tell it to the People.</p>
               <p rend="small">3. It is things to come that are here revealed; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I cannot receive thoſe two Learned mens Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who make it a Hiſtory in a Prophetick ſtyle, and ſay, that moſt, or very much of it, was done before it was written.</p>
               <p rend="small">4. The word [<hi>ſhortly</hi>] made them expound almoſt the whole Book of things all fulfilled about <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s time, or preſently after <hi>Alaricus</hi>'s ſacking of <hi>Rome.</hi> But [<hi>ſhortly</hi>] may ſignifie no more than, 1. That theſe things will ſhortly be begun, though not ſo quickly finiſhed; And 2. That a thouſand years is with the Lord but as one day. But I confeſs that ſo much, as can be proved already done, we muſt not feign to be yet to come.</p>
               <p rend="small">5. It is moſt like that this <hi>John</hi> was the Apoſtle, but it's not certain.</p>

Why they are called <hi>Seven,</hi> ſome ſay is, becauſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven goeth for a number of perfection, whence the <hi>Seven</hi> Planets, the ſeven days of the week, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But this is but mens conceit, and no part of God's Word. Nor can we prove hence, that God hath ſet ſeven Angels above all the reſt. But all that we can know of it is, that <hi>John,</hi> being commanded to write to ſeven Churches, numbereth the Guardian Angels accordingly from their Charges.</p>
               <p rend="small">3. This is no Prayer to theſe Angels, but a notice that God's Mercies are communicated to thoſe Churches by their Miniſtry, and this meſſage ſent by them from Chriſt.</p>
               <p rend="small">The naming of the ſeven Spirits before Chriſt, is no preferring them as above him: But Chriſt is after named, becauſse much more is to be ſaid there of him together.</p>
               <p rend="small">5. Why ſeven Churches only are named, men vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly conjecture; ſome ſay, becauſe they are ſpoken of prophetically, as in their names ſeven ſtates of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Church, or its notable parts, to the end, are ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. But this (being impoſſible to be proved) is rather to pretend another Revelation, than to expound this. Others ſay, that it being only the <hi>Pro-Conſular Aſia</hi> that <hi>John</hi> wrote to, theſe ſeven being the Metropolitan City-Churches, did comprehend all the reſt, as parts under them. But 1.

If they mean that theſe were then made Eccleſiaſtical Metropolis's, it's a fiction with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, and againſt, Hiſtorical evidence, which tells us of a far later date of Metropolitical Churches. 3. If they mean that they were Metropolis's only in a Civil ſenſe, and that the Apoſtles, in planting Churches there, purpoſed or or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained that afterwards Church-Power ſhould follow the Order of the Seats of Civil Power, I anſwer 1. That this is a crude unproved Aſſertion, and therefore of no authority or credit. 2. And it's known, that it was four hundred years after that this was decreed by a Council as a new thing. 3. And this was ſo far from being A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolical, that it confounded the Church, ſetting in ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority the worſt men that could but get into a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolis, and putting all Biſhops and Churches at preſent under the Power of the People and Pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="1">1. UNto the angel of the church of Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, write, Theſe things ſaith he that holdeth the ſeven ſtars in his right hand, who walketh in the midſt of the ſeven golden candleſticks:</p>
               <p rend="small">1. To the Paſtors and Flock of the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> meant by the name of their Angels, Theſe things ſaith Chriſt before deſcribed, and commandeth me to write them.</p>
               <p rend="small">
                  <hi>Note</hi> 1. I believe not that <hi>Timothy</hi> was their Biſhop in the ordinary ſenſe as a fixed Paſtor of that Church alone; but that he in his Itinerant courſe (deſcribed in Scripture, doing the work of an Evangeliſt) was there ſometime, and is therefore by the Ancients called their Biſhop, as Apoſtles were called Biſhops, for planting and taking care for many Churches; when as there is not the leaſt
<pb facs="tcp:66325:278"/>
proof that they appropriated any Dioceſſes or Churches to each, as their proper charge, which other Apoſtles might not uſe the ſame Authority with, or were fixed to any.</p>
               <p rend="small">2. I believe it yet leſs probable that <hi>Timothy</hi> was the Angel here accuſed, of leaving and falling from his firſt Love.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I know thy works, and thy labour, and thy patience, and how thou canſt not bear them which are evil, and thou haſt tried them which ſay they are apoſtles, and are not, and haſt found them liars:</p>
               <p rend="small">2. Thy good works, and great labour in the Goſpel, and thy patience in ſuffering for it, are not unknown or diſregarded by me: And it is thy praiſe that thou doſt not countenance nor tolerate among you, the ſeducing Hereticks and wicked men; and that thoſe that have pretended Inſpiration, as ſent of God, thou haſt tryed, and rejected them as proved liars and falſe Apoſtles.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And haſt born, and haſt patience, and for my names ſake haſt laboured, and haſt not fainted.</p>

               <p n="4">4. Nevertheleſs, I have <hi>ſomewhat</hi> againſt thee, becauſe thou haſt left thy firſt love.</p>
               <p rend="small">4. But for this I reprove thee, that you have not that hearty, ſervent Love to me, and to one another, which you had at the firſt; and that you grow colder when you ſhould grow better.</p>
               <p rend="small">
                  <hi>Note</hi>; Even good people may fall into a more cold, declining ſtate, by negligence.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the firſt works, or elſe I will come unto thee quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and will remove thy candleſtick out of his place, except thou repent.</p>
               <p rend="small">5. Look back on thy firſt Love and Works, and think whether it was not then better with thee, and whether thou hadſt any cauſe to decline; Return to thy firſt works, or el;ſe I will ſhortly viſit thee with the heavy puniſhment, of taking the Miniſtry and Goſpel from thee.</p>
               <p rend="small">
                  <hi>Note</hi> 1. Declinings from former Love and Duty are diſpleaſing to God, and tend to worſe. 2. It is a grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous puniſhment to have the Goſpel and Miniſtry taken away, either by Wars, Devaſtations, Perſecutions, Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencing, and worſt by wilful Expulſion.</p>
               <p n="6">6. But this thou haſt, that thou hateſt the deeds of the Nicolaitans, which I alſo hate.</p>
               <p rend="small">6. It is commendable in thee, that thou hateſt the deeds of the <hi>Nicolaitans,</hi> for I hate them.</p>
               <p rend="small">
                  <hi>Note</hi>; It is lawful to diſtinguiſh ſuch Hereticks as are not to be tolerated in Church-Communion by the names of their Leaders: But this ſhould not be done againſt tolerable differences, as tending to divide thoſe that ſhould all unite in the Chriſtian name.</p>
               <p rend="small">2. God hateth licentious Doctrines and Deeds, and ſo muſt we.</p>
               <p rend="small">3. Whence theſe <hi>Nicolaitans</hi> had their name is not known certainly, but doubtful Tradition in Hiſtory tells us, that <hi>Nicholas</hi> the Deacon, <hi>Act.</hi> 6. had a beautiful Wife, and he was blamed as jealous of her; and that thereupon he brought her forth, and bid who would take her, to ſhew that he was above all fleſhly luſt; and that ſome people, miſunderstanding him, thence took occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to plead for the lawfulneſs of Fornication. The Hereſie of theſe hateful <hi>Nicolaitans</hi> lay, 1. In making light of Fornication, 2. And in deſpiſing the Heathens Government, as if Chriſtian Liberty lay in being from under its power; 3. And in teaching that to avoid ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, men might deny Chriſt with the mouth, while the heart denyed him not; 4. And that they might eat things offered to Idols, ſo they deſpiſed the Idol in their hearts. <hi>Paul, Act.</hi> 20. had before told theſe <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians,</hi> that grievous Wolves ſhould enter and devour; and that of their own ſelves men ſhould ariſe ſpeaking perverſe things, to draw Diſciples after them: And it ſeems thus warned, they hated the Hereſies. And St. <hi>John</hi> himſelf lived in <hi>Aſia,</hi> and is ſaid to die at <hi>Eph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> who no doubt would warn them (and was aſ above <hi>Timothy</hi>)</p>
               <p n="7">7. He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit ſaith unto the churches, To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midſt of the paradiſe of God.</p>
               <p rend="small">7. Let all that hear or read theſe words of the Spirit to the Churches, ſet their hearts to them with regard, as of great and common importance: To him that in the day of Tryal and Temptation doth overcome, by being true to Chriſt, and keeping his Innocency, I will give a part in everlaſting Happineſs, ſignified by the Tree of Life in Paradiſe.</p>
               <p rend="small">
                  <hi>Note</hi> 1. Striving without overcoming in Temptation, ſo far as to keep our uprightneſs and faithfulneſs, will not ſave men (much leſs lazy wiſhes.)</p>
               <p rend="small">2. Though Faith put us at firſt in a ſtate of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and Life, to thoſe that ſurvive, Perſeverance and Victory are conditions of Salvation.</p>
               <p rend="small">3. It ſeems that the ſenſe of the Tree of Life in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. Is here expounded to be, Everlaſting Life of Bleſſedneſs with God; and ſo in the New <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>ch.</hi> 21.22.</p>
               <p n="8">8. And unto the angel of the church in Smyrna, write, Theſe things ſaith the Firſt and the Laſt, which was dead, and is alive,</p>
               <p rend="small">8. <hi>Note</hi>; Chriſt is not barely named, but deſcribed by Divine Properties, to awe the Church with reverence to him, and to reſolve them to Truſt him, who can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver and reward them.</p>
               <p>9. I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou art rich) and I <hi>know</hi> the blaſphemy of them which ſay they are Jews and are not, but <hi>are</hi> the ſynagogue of Satan.</p>
               <p rend="small">9. I know with approbation and praiſe, thy labour,
<pb facs="tcp:66325:279"/>
and ſufferings, and worldly poverty; but thou art rich in grace: And I know that blaſphemous Sect, that tempt and reproach thee, who by obtruding <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law on the Churches, (or at leaſt ſeem Jews to avoid their malice) do trouble the Churches againſt Purity, Unity and Peace, and are Satans Synagogue, as thus doing his work.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Fear none of thoſe things which thou ſhalt ſuffer: behold, the devil ſhall caſt ſome of you into priſon, that ye may be tried, and ye ſhall have tribulation ten days: be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.</p>
               <p rend="small">10. Fear not though thou muſt ſuffer; and I foretel thee what thy ſufferings will be: But I will fully reward thee.</p>
               <p rend="small">
                  <hi>Note</hi> 1. Certainty of ſuffering may conſiſt with the Conqueſt of cowardly fear.</p>
               <p rend="small">2. It is the Devil that impriſoneth and perſecuteth Chriſt's Servants, when his wicked Servants do it by his Temptation.</p>
               <p rend="small">3. Priſons and Perſecutions are for the Tryal of the Faithful. Our care therefore muſt be, that we fall not in the Tryal.</p>
               <p rend="small">4. Ten days is a ſhort time, yet ſeemeth long to the fleſh.</p>
               <p rend="small">5. The Crown of Life Everlaſting is the ſure reward of true Martyrdom and Perſeverance in Tryal.</p>
               <p n="11">11. He that hath an ear, let him hear what the ſpirit ſaith unto the Churches. He that overcometh, ſhall not be hurt of the ſecond death.</p>
               <p rend="small">11. Theſe Warnings of the Spirit to the Chruches are recorded, as of great Concernment for all. It is they that overcome the Love of this Life and World, even unto death, if God call them to Martyrdom, that ſhall eſcape that ſorer ſecond Death that, after this Life, will befall the Ungodly.</p>
               <p n="12">12. And to the angel of the church in Pergamos, write, Theſe things ſaith he which hath the ſharp ſword with two edges.</p>
               <p rend="small">12. To the Paſtors and People of the Church of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamos,</hi> noted by the word Angel, Chriſt, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>hat hath his dreadful Juſtice, as well as ſaving Mercy, ſendeth this Meſſage.</p>
               <p rend="small">
                  <hi>Note</hi>; Once for all here note, that Churches were then named from Cities, becauſe Proximity was needful to Communion: And among Chriſtians, there ſhould be ſo great Unity, that they that live in one Proximity (like our Pariſhes or Towns) ſhould always be of one Church, unleſs the uncapable multitude force them to divide in one City, into many Churches; in which ſtill Proximity ſhould be obſerved; or unleſs the great Corruption, or Violence, of any Church do neceſſitate any to congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate by themſelves, for their ſafety and duty. For if the faults of a Church, and any of its Members, be but tolerable Weakneſſes, it ſhould not break their Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, but they ſhould bear with, and receive each other: But if they are intolerable, for which God diſowneth and forſaketh them, or their Worſhip, they are no true Churches, and muſt be forſaken of all, as no true parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Chriſtians, and muſt be caſt out.</p>
               <p n="13">13. I know thy works, and where thou dwelleſt, <hi>even</hi> where Satan's ſeat is, and thou holdeſt faſt my Name, and haſt not denied my faith, even in thoſe days where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Antipas <hi>was</hi> my faithful martyr, who was ſlain among you, where Satan dwelleth.</p>
               <p rend="small">13. I know, with Approbation, all thy good Works, and that thou dwelleſt where Satan ruleth in the Heathen multitude; having there an Idol-Temple, and <hi>Roman,</hi> perſecuting Powers; and that yet thou haſt held faſt the Profeſſion of Chriſtianity, and not denyed me in Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution; even in the days when Satan's Inſtruments mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd my faithful Martyr <hi>Antipas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p rend="small">
                  <hi>Note</hi>; We have no other certain Hiſtory of <hi>Antipas,</hi> and his Caſe, but only the uncertain ſtories of <hi>Metaphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſles,</hi> and the Menology. No doubt but there were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Martyrs, whoſe Hiſtory is not come down to us: But Chriſt hath honoured <hi>Antipas</hi> by this ſacred Record: The time of his ſuffering is unknown.</p>
               <p n="14">14. But I have a few things againſt thee, becauſe thou haſt there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balac to caſt a ſtumbling-block before the children of Iſrael, to eat things ſacrificed unto idols, and to commit fornication.</p>
               <p rend="small">14. Though all this Good be found in thee, I am of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended that thou ſo conniveſt at the Hereſie of the falſe Teachers, as to permit ſome of them in your Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, who, as <hi>Balaam</hi> for Gain taught <hi>Balac</hi> how to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnare the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> into ſin by Women, ſo they lay Snares and Temptations before men, by teaching them, that it is lawful to eat things offered to Idols, and to commit Fornication.</p>
               <p rend="small">
                  <hi>Note</hi>; Had not this Church tolerated theſe filthy He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks in their Communion, Chriſt would not have bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med them for their meer Neighbourhood.</p>
               <p n="15">15. So haſt thou alſo them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans, which thing I hate.</p>
               <p rend="small">15. And thou haſt yet in thy Communion ſome that hold the Doctrine of the <hi>Nicolaitans,</hi> which maketh light of Adulteries, which is hateful to me.</p>
               <p rend="small">
                  <hi>Note</hi>; Chriſt hateth all ſuch falſe Doctrine as corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Faith or Manners.</p>
               <p n="16">16. Repent, or elſe I will come unto thee quickly, and will fight againſt them with the ſword of my mouth.</p>
               <p rend="small">16. Repent of thy connivance at this wicked Sect and Doctrine, and caſt out them that will not be cured; or elſe with the two-edged Sword, which goeth out of my mouth, I will ſhortly cut off theſe Hereticks, and puniſh thee for bearing with them.</p>
               <p n="17">17. He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit ſaith unto the churches, To him that overcometh will I give to eat of
<pb facs="tcp:66325:279"/>
the hidden manna, and will give him a white ſtone, and in the ſtone a new name written, which no man knoweth, ſaving he that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth it.</p>
               <p rend="small">17. Let no man diſregard what the Spirit ſaith to the Churches: To him that overcometh the manifold Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, of Perſecutors, falſe Teachers, and fleſhly luſts, I will give the bread of life, that hidden Manna which is laid up in the heavenly Sanctuary, even Chriſt and his Spirit; and in the grace of that Spirit I will give him a Pledge and Title to Eternal Life, and that new Name and Nature, <hi>Holineſs</hi> and the Divine Image, the evidence of right to the heavenly Inheritance, whoſe Nature and Worth none rightly know, but thoſe who receive it. Thus ſhall it be done to them whom I will honour.</p>
               <p n="18">18. And unto the angel of the church in Thyatira, write, Theſe things ſaith the Son of God, who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire, and his feet <hi>are</hi> like fine braſs.</p>
               <p rend="small">18.

                  </gap>o me, with Eyes like a flame, and Feet ſhining as burniſh't Braſs.</p>
               <p n="19">19. I know thy works, and charity, and ſervice, and faith, and thy patience, and thy works, and the laſt <hi>to be</hi> more than the firſt.</p>
               <p rend="small">19. I know and commend thy good Works and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and Miniſtration to the Saints, and thy Fidelity and conſtant Patience in Tryals, and that thy laſt Works excel thy firſt.</p>
               <p n="20">20. Notwithſtanding, I have a few things againſt thee, becauſe thou ſuffereſt that woman Jezebel, which calleth her ſelf a propheteſs, to teach, and to ſeduce my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to commit fornication, and to eat things ſacrificed unto idols. 21. And I gave her ſpace to repent of her fornication, and ſhe repented not.</p>
               <p rend="small">20. <hi>Note</hi> 1. Even a few faults in a laudable Church may be a provocation to the Juſtice of Chriſt. 2. Suffering corrupt Doctrines and Seducers in a Church, is a ſin which Chriſt will not paſs by. Suffering was not oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to Baniſhing, Impriſoning, Killing: For the Church had no ſuch power or command. But it was forbearing that ſharp Reproof, Confutation and Excommunication which was the Churches duty. 3. Whether there were really a Woman among them that promoted this wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, by pretence of Prophetick Inſpiration, or whether, by the Woman <hi>Jezabel,</hi> be meant the whole Sect of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colaitans</hi> or <hi>Gnoſticks,</hi> is uncertain. But it's certain that the Hereſie tolerated was the ſame as was before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, and that <hi>Paul</hi> was put ſo oft to write againſt, <hi>viz.</hi> Fornication and Idol-Sacrifices, pleaded for as law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for Chriſtians to partake of, ſo they kept their faith and hearts to God. 4. Impenitence after God's Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and Warnings, ripeneth men for Judgment.</p>
               <p n="22">22. Behold, I will caſt her into a bed, and them that commit adultery with her, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to great tribulation, except they repent of their deeds. 23. And I will kill her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren with death, and all the churches ſhall know that I am he which ſearcheth the reins and hearts: and I will give unto e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one of you according to your works.</p>
               <p rend="small">22, 23. Inſtead of a Bed of Luſt, I will caſt her, and all her ſeduced Sect, into a Bed of great Tribulation, except true Repentance and Reformation prevent it; ſo that all the Churches ſhall ſee my heavy Plagues on them, and ſhall know that I diſcern, and hate, and judge the moſt ſecret luſts and ſins; and will judge you, and all men, according to your works.</p>
               <p rend="small">
                  <hi>Note; Judging</hi> is either <hi>Juſtifying</hi> or <hi>Condemning,</hi> and <hi>Executing</hi> accordingly. Our firſt Juſtification, which <hi>maketh us Juſt,</hi> and ſo <hi>Accounts us,</hi> is not according to any works ſtrictly ſo called, unleſs you will call it a work, believingly to <hi>Accept a free gift</hi>: Nor is our Juſtification in Judgment according to the works of the Law of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency, or of <hi>Moſes,</hi> or any that can be thought to make the Reward not of Grace, but of Debt: But it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our performing the Covenant of Chriſtianity, made by Chriſt the condition of Salvation.</p>
               <p n="24">24. But unto you I ſay, and to the reſt in Thyatira, as many as have not this doctrine, and which have not known the depths of Satan, as they ſpeak, I will put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you none other burden. 25.

                  <hi>Note</hi>; The Roll contained God's Decrees, as they were to be fulfilled according to this Prophecy: And it's like they were ſeven Rolls together making one Book.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And I ſaw a ſtrong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is worthy to open the book, and to looſe the ſeals thereof?</p>
               <p rend="small">2. <hi>Note</hi>; Every Angel or Man is not worthy or meet to be the Expoſitor and Meſſenger of God's Myſteries to Man.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And no man in heaven, nor in earth, neither under the earth, was able to open the book, neither to look thereon.</p>
               <p rend="small">3. It was a work and truſt too high for any meer crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in all the World: None of them was worthy.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And I wept much, becauſe no man was found worthy to open and to read the book, neither to look thereon.</p>
               <p rend="small">4. I lamented that the creatures ſhould, be found ſo unworthy, and God's Myſteries be kept unknown.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And one of the elders ſaith unto me, Weep not: behold, the lion of the tribe of Judah, the root of David, hath prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to open the book, and to looſe the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſeals thereof.</p>
               <p rend="small">5. One of the Elders, that were at the Throne, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted me, and told me that Chriſt, who is called the Lion of the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> and the Son of <hi>David,</hi> and Root of <hi>Jeſſe,</hi> was found worthy by the Dignity of his Perſon, and his Merits by Man's Redemption, to open to the Church all the Myſteries of God, which it was meet for Man to know, and to looſe the Seals.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And I beheld, and lo, in the midſt of the throne, and of the four beaſts, and in the midſt of the elders, ſtood a Lamb, as it had been ſlain, having ſeven horns, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven eyes, which are the ſeven Spirits of God, ſent forth into all the earth.</p>
               <p rend="small">6. Upon this glad tidings, I lookt and ſaw Chriſt in the likeneſs of a Lamb, wounded and bloody, as he was ſacrificed, which ſignified that it was by the Merit of Redemption that he had his power over all: And he ſeemed to have ſeven Horns and Eyes for the exerciſe of Government, by Judgment and Victory over his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and Illumination of his Church, and the full no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of all that concerneth his Government; which is done by the Spiritual Powers, or Angels and Miniſters, whom he ſendeth forth from God into all the Earth: Or, as others by the manifold Gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, which is his Agent or Advocate on Earth.</p>
               <p n="7">7. And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that ſate upon the throne.</p>
               <p rend="small">7. He that alone was worthy, received Power from God, both to open the Myſteries, and execute them.</p>
               <p n="8">8. And when he had taken the book, the four beaſts, and four and twenty elders, fell down before the Lamb, having every one of them harps, and golden vials full of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours, which are the prayers of ſaints:</p>
               <p rend="small">8. <hi>Note,</hi> Who were the four Living Wights (here ill tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated Beaſts, when one was a Man) was before enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, but its hard to know, only they ſeem to ſignifie ſome Greater than the Elders. Some Papiſts think they were the four firſt Patriarcks; and the Elders the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils. Its more probable than ſo, that they were all the ſorts of Miniſters that were entruſted with the firſt ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of Churches and ſealing the Goſpel by Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, as diſtinct from the fixed Church-Biſhops called Elders. That is, that they were Apoſtles, Prophets, Evangeliſts and Miracle-workers as ſuch. But all is doubtfull.</p>
               <p rend="small">
                  <pb facs="tcp:66325:282"/>2. That both the Living Wights and the Elders were men on earth, is plain by their work here deſcribed; They are Prieſts that, in the ſacred Aſſembly, do by office Speak for and Lead the Church in offering up the Common Praiſes to God, and alſo the Prayers of the Congregation. That there be any Angels that reſemble this office in Heaven, we cannot conclude from ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure a Text.</p>
               <p rend="small">Hence we ſee, 1. That Church Guides are the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers of Jeſus: 2. Though we cannot hence prove that Gods praiſes muſt be uſed with harps and Muſicall Inſtruments, they that uſe ſuch have a fairer pretence hence to prove them lawful (as doing Gods will, on earth, as <hi>John</hi> ſaw it reſembled in Heaven) than any can ſhew to prove it unlawful. 3. Miniſters in offering up the Churches praiſe and prayers, are ſubmediators under Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="9">9. And they ſung a new ſong, ſaying, Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the ſeals thereof: for thou waſt ſlain, and haſt redeemed us to God by thy blood, out of every kindred, and tongue, and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and nation; 10. And haſt made us unto our God, Kings and Prieſts: and we ſhall reign on the earth.</p>
               <p rend="small">9.10. <hi>Note,</hi> 1. Chriſt is to be praiſed in the Church with a new ſong, or Praiſes ſuited to his works of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and his Glory, and not only with the Jewiſh Pſalms and Worſhip<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (though thoſe Pſalms alſo may be uſed) 2. Though the Collective phraſe of gathering out of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry nation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> makes ſome think that it is an aſſembly of Glorified Saints in the heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> called the General Aſſembly of the firſt born, and the Spirits of the perfected juſt that is here primarily meant, it ſeems more probable that it is the Church on earth alone: And that it is the firſt ages by Faith, and the following al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, by ſome experience of the Churches deliverance by <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> that mention reigning on the earth: The Saints departed indeed ſhall judge the World. To be Kings and Prieſts to God, is to be endowed with Power, and Honour, and Holyneſs, and employed accordingly in Gods adminiſtrations and Holy Worſhip.</p>
               <p n="11">11. And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne, and the beaſts, and the elders: and the number of them was ten thouſand times ten thouſand, and thouſands of thouſands;</p>

                  <hi>Note,</hi> That this ſignifies the multitude of believers, or of Miniſters through all the World, is not to be proved. But that it is meant properly of Angels is moſt probable. And it is to be noted that when the Living Wights are but four, and the Elders but twenty four, the Angels that praiſe Chriſt are millions and numberleſs. So <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.24.

               <p rend="small">
                  <hi>Note,</hi> Thoſe Angels that joyn with us in Chriſts praiſes, and are preſent in our aſſemblies, and Guardians of us and them, and pitch their tents about us, and bear us up in their hands, and rejoice in our Converſion, and are miniſtring Spirits for our good, are not ſo ignorant of us and our concerns and our prayers, as ſome imagine. We have many ignorant men that think they know more of our caſe here below than the Angels do; when they ſcarce know ſo much as may keep them from being ſeducers, and deviders, of the Church. They are ſure but ill Guardians who know as little of our affairs as theſe men think. Chriſt ſaith that the leaſt Chriſtians have their Angels who behold the face of God; And why are they called their Angels, and what do they for them with God, if they know not our condition and concerns? And though this will not warrant Praying to them, which themſelves in this book ſeem to diſown; yet we ought not to think that miſtake of thoſe ancient fathers and Churches to be greater than it was, who thought that, as Paſtors on earth offer up the Congregations prayers and praiſes to God, ſo there is an anſwerable office of Angels to offer them, as from them to Chriſt, who offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them to God the Father: And who thought, as a man might pray a Miniſter to pray for him, ſo he might do an Angel, though it be an errour, one is no more Idolatry than the other.</p>

               <p n="1">1. ANd there appeared a great wonder in heaven, a woman clothed with the ſun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve ſtars.</p>
               <p rend="small">1. Some Popes, and their Flatterers, have ſaid that, by the Woman in Heaven, is meant, the Pope, and Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in its Power; and by the Sun is meant, their ſpiritual Power, as Key-bearers of Heaven; and by the Moon is meant, all Princes Secular Power as under the feet of the Papal Church, at leaſt, in order to the ends of the ſpiritual Power; by which he may, if they deſerve it, excommunicate and depoſe them.</p>
               <p rend="small">By others is underſtood the Chriſtian Church, now raiſed to Honour, and flouriſhing in Grace and Wiſdom, and having worldly Proſperity as a lower part of her Bleſſing; or, ſay others, trampling on Wealth, and worldly things, with a holy Contempt: And known by this Enſign of Honour, that the twelve Apoſtles were its Founders, under Chriſt; and that ſtill they hold faſt the Apoſtolical Doctrine, and depart not from it by humane deprivations, or by heretical Seduction and Corruption. This is a Crown of Glory to the pure Church, being not yet ſeduced from Chriſtian, Apoſtolick Simplicity.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And ſhe being with child, cried, tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing in birth, and pained to be delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
               <p rend="small">2. She laboured with earneſt deſire to propagate Chriſtianity through the World. Some refer this to the Jewiſh Church deſiring Chriſt's Nativity; but moſt, to the labour of Miniſters to ſpread the Goſpel; and ſome, ſpecially, to the Converſion of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And there appeared another wonder in heaven, and behold, a great red dragon, having ſeven heads, and ten horns, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven crowns upon his heads.</p>
               <p rend="small">3. The Devil appeared in the ſhape of a great red Dragon (ſpecially <hi>Mars,</hi> whom the Heathen <hi>Romans</hi> took for their ſpecial God.) His ſeven Heads and Crowns ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie his great Power, eſpecially at <hi>Rome,</hi> the City that had ſeven Hills, and ruled in the Earth: and the ten Horns are the Kingdoms or Provinces of the Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And his tail drew the third part of the ſtars of heaven, and did caſt them to the earth: and the dragon ſtood before the woman which was ready to be delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, for to devour her child as ſoon as it was born.</p>
               <p rend="small">4. By his Tail, ſay many, is meant, his Subtilty; by Hereticks he corrupted a third part of Chriſtians; which, ſaith Dr. <hi>H.</hi> was by <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> and the <hi>Gno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks:</hi> Say others, by all the Swarm of Hereſies. (<hi>Lira</hi> ſaith, All this is ſpoken of the War of <hi>Coſroe,</hi> King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> againſt the Chriſtians.) Moſt Proteſtants ſay, it is meant of the <hi>Roman,</hi> perſecuting, Emperors Succeſſes, acted by <hi>Satan,</hi> who ſought to extirpate Chriſtianity.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And ſhe brought forth a man-child, who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron: and her child was caught up unto God, and to his throne.</p>
               <p rend="small">5. This Child, ſay ſome, was Chriſt; others ſay, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine</hi>; moſt ſay, the Church, as proſperous, which, in <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s time, was to be advanced to Power, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail againſt Heatheniſm, both by the Word, and by the Sword: Or that Chriſt, by the Church, was thus to rule: Or, as others, the Martyrs, taken up to God, triumphed by ſuffering, and furthered the Glory of the Church. Others think it meaneth that, in the days of the honeſt Heathen Emperors, <hi>Alexander Severus, Philip Arabs, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantius Chlorus, &amp;c.</hi> the Church travailed, as in the pains of Child-birth; but was to ſuffer with patience, as in the Wilderneſs, till <hi>Decius, Diocleſian, Max. Hercul. Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entius</hi> and <hi>Licinius</hi> had done perſecuting: and then it was delivered by <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> to an advanced, free Church-ſtate.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And the woman fled into the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, where ſhe hath a place prepared of God, that they ſhould feed her there a thouſand two hundred and threeſcore days.</p>
               <p rend="small">6. Say ſome, the Church throughout the Empire, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted by <hi>Nero</hi> for three Years and a half, was put to
<pb facs="tcp:66325:288"/>
worſhip God in Obſcurity, and as in Flight: (But <hi>Nero</hi>'s Perſecution was before <hi>John</hi> wrote this, if under <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian.</hi>) Others, more probably, refer it to the later <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Perſecutions, under which God kept his Church till its Deliverance. And ſome underſtand it of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt's driving the pure Church, as into a Wilderneſs.</p>
               <p n="7">7. And there was war in heaven, Michael and his angels fought againſt the dragon, and the dragon fought and his angels: 8. And prevailed not, neither was their place found any more in heaven.</p>
               <p rend="small">7, 8. Some expound this of the Conflict at <hi>Rome,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Simon Magus</hi> and <hi>Simon Peter</hi> (long before <hi>John</hi> wrote this, if the ſtory be true.) Others more proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſay, it repreſents the Churches Perſecution by the Heathen Emperors (eſpecially <hi>Diocleſian, Maxentius, Lici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, &amp;c.</hi>) and their final Overthrow by <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> by a War in Heaven, of which this was the Effect. By <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael</hi> ſome mean Chriſt; Others rather that Arch-an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, mentioned <hi>Dan.</hi> 10. who was Guardian Prince over <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> and is now ſuch to the Church. And whether ſuch have real War in the Air with Devils, is doubtful. But the caſting out Devil-worſhip, in the Empire, is here meant, as the Effect.</p>
               <p n="9">9. And the great dragon was caſt out, that old ſerpent, called the devil and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was caſt out into the earth, and his angels were caſt out with him.</p>
               <p rend="small">9. By the Similitude of caſting down from Heaven to Earth, is ſignified, that Satan and Idolaters were caſt out of Power and Honour in the World, as Earth is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the Church and Empire.</p>
               <p n="10">10. And I heard a loud voice ſaying in heaven, Now is come ſalvation, and ſtrength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Chriſt: for the accuſer of our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren is caſt down, which accuſed them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our God day and night.</p>
               <p rend="small">10. The Church Triumphant and Militant glorifies God for this wonderful Change; which ſhewed his ſtrength for the ſetting up his Kingdom, and the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of Chriſt's Power, and the Salvation of Men, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering the Devil, and the Heathens.</p>
               <p rend="small">
                  <hi>Note</hi> 1. If Chriſtian Kingdoms be ſo honourable, and called the Kingdoms of God, and the Power of Chriſt, and the Fall of Devils, let them better conſider it, that cry them down under the name of National Churches, and would have Churches to be only ſome gathered out of the multitude.</p>
               <p rend="small">2. Queſt. <hi>Why doth Satan accuſe Saints, day and night, to God, who never receiveth his falſe Accuſations? Anſ.</hi> 1. He hath too many true Accuſations againſt them. 2. He ſheweth his Malice, though without Succeſs. 3. He ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſeth them, by Slanderers and falſe Witneſſes, to the Rulers of the World, and to the People, to keep them in hatred of Faith and Godlineſs.</p>
               <p n="11">11. And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their teſtimony, and they loved not their lives unto the death.</p>
               <p rend="small">11. Not only Chriſt, but the Faithful under him, conquer Satan, and Heathens, and all the Churches Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. 1. By the Blood of Chriſt, whoſe Sufferings, truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to, are the Merit of their Succeſſes. 2. By the Word of God, preached, pleaded and witneſſed by them. 3. By their Sufferings and Martyrdoms.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Therefore rejoyce ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them: wo to the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the earth, and of the ſea; for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, becauſe he knoweth that he hath but a ſhort time.</p>
               <p rend="small">12. <hi>Lira</hi> thought that this was <hi>Coſrot,</hi> King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> who, being conquered by <hi>Heraclius</hi> gave the Church great cauſe of Joy, but wofully oppreſſed his own Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; though, being old, he had not long to do it. Dr. <hi>H.</hi> ſaith, It was the Churches ioy, &amp; the Devils rage, for the Overthrow of <hi>Simon Magus</hi>; and that now he fore-ſaw the Fall of his Kingdom, he ſet on foot <hi>Nero</hi>'s Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Others That, the Empire turning Chriſtians, the Devil raged, by <hi>Julian, Valens,</hi> and ſuch others, for a little while, both againſt Laity and Clergy. Some think that it is properly thoſe in Heaven that rejoyce: Others, that it is the Church on Earth: Others, that it is both. And ſome ſay, It is upon the Approach of the <hi>Millenium,</hi> after the Fall of Antichriſt.</p>
               <p rend="small">
                  <hi>Note,</hi> 1. To be delivered from Satan, and ſee his Kingdom fall, is matter of great joy. 2. If Satan rage, becauſe he knoweth that his time is ſhort, how much ſhould we be quickened to Diligence and Hope, when we all know that our time on Earth is ſhort.</p>
               <p n="13">13. And when the dragon ſaw that he was caſt unto the earth, he perſecuted the woman which brought forth the man-child.</p>
               <p rend="small">13. Saith <hi>Lira,</hi> when <hi>Coſroe</hi> ſaw that he was conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by <hi>Heraclius,</hi> he perſecuted the Chriſtians in his own Dominions, whom <hi>Heraclius</hi> relieved by two Armies. Saith Dr. <hi>H.</hi> When Satan ſaw that he was conquered in <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> he ſtirred up <hi>Rome</hi> againſt the Chriſtians. Say others, more probably, when Satan ſaw that vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant Paſtors had defeated his Religious Frauds by Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, he turned to the way of Violence by Perſecutors; firſt Heathens, then <hi>Arrians.</hi> Some ſay, This contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all the time from <hi>Anno</hi> 310. to 606.

                  </gap> Fathers expounded this of an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt, that ſhould come toward the end of the World. Some Papiſts take it to be the ſecond <hi>Coſroe,</hi> that ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded his Father in <hi>Perſia.</hi> Others take the Beaſt to be the ſtate of the Heathen Religion at <hi>Rome</hi>; the ſeven Heads ſignifying either ſeven Emperors, or the ſeven Hills; and the ten Horns, and the Crowns, the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Kingdoms; and the name of Blaſphemy, the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles of <hi>Rome,</hi> called, <hi>A Goddeſs, and the eternal City,</hi> with its Idolatrous Profeſſion. Others take the two Beaſts here, to be but one, under two Relations; that is, the Pope, or Papacy: Or, ſay ſome, the <hi>Roman</hi> Kingdom under the Pope, and the Papacy it ſelf, as Eccleſiaſtick. Some take the Devil to be this Beaſt; ſome, the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Empire; ſome, the <hi>Greek</hi> Empire: and ſome take this firſt Beaſt to be the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, as Chriſtian. The hardeſt part of the Controverſie is between them that ſay, <hi>It is Heathen</hi> Rome, and thoſe that ſay, <hi>It is Papal</hi> Rome: And the Reaſons which they give againſt each other, ſeem ſtronger than the aſſertive Reaſons of either ſide; of which, many Volumes are written. Some ſay, that the ſeven Heads are ſeven Kings, which went imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately before Antichriſt; and that the name of Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy is, ſay ſome, the Titles given the Pope (as <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>

               <p n="2">2. And the beaſt which I ſaw was like unto a leopard, and his feet were as <hi>the feet</hi> of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion: and the dragon gave him his power, and his ſeat, and great Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
               <p rend="small">2. The Leopard was the Type of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> the Bear of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> and the Lyon of the <hi>Babylonians</hi>: And all are ſet together, to ſignifie the Cruelty of the firſt Beaſt, and variety of its Exerciſe. This was the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Idolatry, as exerciſed by <hi>Domitian, &amp;c.</hi> ſay ſome, to which Satan made the Imperial Power to contribute its utmoſt help. Or, as others, it was the Papal Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and Cruelty, which Satan now propagated by Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian names and pretences, as before he had promoted the like, in the name of Heathens Gods.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And I ſaw one of his heads, as it were wounded to death, and his deadly wound was healed: and all the world wondred af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the beaſt.</p>
               <p rend="small">3. To paſs by thoſe, that expound this of the Son of <hi>Coſroe,</hi> King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> ſome take it for the burning of the <hi>Capitol</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> the Head-Temple of Idols; either in <hi>Vitellius</hi>'s Stirs, when after <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> rebuilt it; or in <hi>Titus</hi>'s Reign, when, being burnt by Lightning, <hi>Domitian</hi> rebuilt it. But it ſeemeth unlikely that all this ſhould be ſpoken of ſo ſmall a matter as a Temple. Others ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound it of the ſacking and taking of <hi>Rome</hi> five times in forty two Years, by the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals</hi>; and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, by <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> and <hi>Beliſarius,</hi> and <hi>Na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Other Proteſtants think, that the many Schiſms in the Papacy, was the deadly Wound: and that it was healed by the Councils of <hi>Conſtance</hi> and <hi>Baſil.</hi> And others think, that the Reformation gave the Pope the Wound; and
<pb facs="tcp:66325:289"/>
that the Revolt to Popery, in <hi>France,</hi> by <hi>Hen.</hi> IV. in <hi>England,</hi> by Queen <hi>Mary</hi>; in <hi>Germany,</hi> by the Overthrow of the <hi>Palſgrave, &amp;c.</hi> was the healing of it. To <hi>wander after him,</hi> is, to follow him in blind Devotion.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And they worſhipped the dragon which gave power unto the beaſt, and they worſhipped the beaſt, ſaying, Who is like unto the beaſt? who is able to make war with him?</p>
               <p rend="small">4. That is, ſay ſome, They worſhip the Devil, under the name of Heathen Gods, for making their Empire ſo great, and repairing the Wound of their Religion. Say others, They honoured and ſerved the Papacy, and him that erected it, thinking it had been God, when it was the Devil: admiring the Sanctity and Power of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And there was given unto him a mouth ſpeaking great things, and blaſphemies; and power was given unto him to continue forty and two months.</p>
               <p rend="small">5. This the Ancients expound, of an Antichriſt not yet come: And others, of <hi>Domitian:</hi> And others, of the Pope.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And he opened his mouth in blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my againſt God, to blaſpheme his name, and his tabernacle, and them that dwell in heaven.</p>
               <p rend="small">6. Say ſome, He blaſphemed the true God and Chriſt directly; (that is, <hi>Domitian,</hi> perſecuting Chriſtians.) Say others, 'Tis the Papal Blaſphemy, by Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation, Image-worſhip, arrogating God's Prerogatives, perſecuting them that obey his Word, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. And it was given unto him to make war with the ſaints, and to overcome them: and power was given him over all kindreds, and tongues, and nations.</p>

But ſeveral Objections lie againſt this, and ſo there do againſt thoſe that apply it to <hi>Domitian:</hi> And why it may not more plauſibly be applyed to ſome following Perſecutors, eſpecially <hi>Diocleſian,</hi> I ſee not yet. But that it is meant of the Papal Tyranny, is the more eaſily believed by many that know the truth of the Hiſtory, that all the ten Heathen Perſecutions, ſet together, were a little thing, compared to the Papal Blood-ſhed. <hi>Mede</hi> truly tells us, that <hi>Perion</hi> reporteth (and divers ſecond him) t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="8">8. And all that dwell upon the earth ſhall worſhip him, whoſe names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb ſlain from the foundation of the world.</p>
               <p rend="small">8. And his great Power and Victories ſhall cauſe the generality of worldly men, to own, admire and obey him (whether it be the Heathen <hi>Rome,</hi> or <hi>Mahometans,</hi> or the Pope;) except thoſe choſen Children of Wiſdom, whoſe names, from the foundation of the world, were by God's Decree written in the Book of the ſlain Lamb, or in the Catalogue of thoſe who were to be ſaved by Chriſt cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified.</p>
               <p n="9">9. If any man have an ear, let him hear 10. He that leadeth into captivity, ſhall go into captivity: he that killeth with the ſword, muſt be killed with the ſword. Here is the patience and the faith of the ſaints.</p>
               <p rend="small">9, 10. Let all Chriſtians regardfully mark what I ſay, that they be not by the ſucceſs of Perſecutors or Tyrants, tempted from their Patience, Conſtancy or Duty: Though theſe great Conquerours and Perſecutors are a while adored for their Succeſs and Power, in the end they ſhall be uſed as they uſed others, commonly when they have conquered and triumphed, others conquer them, and triumph over them; and when they have killed many, they are uſually killed themſelves: Few fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Conquerors die the common death of all men. Therefore the holy Wiſdom of God teacheth his Saints, as much as is poſſible, to avoid War, even defenſive, and to overcome by Faith and Patience, eſpecially in the caſe of Perſecution, and of private and particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons towards injurious Rulers; though Kingdoms may exerciſe ſelf-defence, leſt they tempt all their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to make them their prey.</p>
               <p n="11">11. And I beheld another beaſt coming up out of the earth, and he had two horns like a lamb, and he ſpake as a dragon.</p>
               <p rend="small">11. Many ſay, that by <hi>Another Beaſt,</hi> is meant the <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> in another reſpect, and that they are but one. But when the Text ſaith, it is Another, with ſo many notes and acts of difference, ſuch preſumption doth not <hi>expound</hi> the ſenſe, but <hi>make</hi> it, and may ſay any other impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable thing. Others that ſay, the firſt Beaſt was Heathen <hi>Rome,</hi> and the ſecond Papal <hi>Rome,</hi> will as hardly as the former make it probable, that Heathen <hi>Rome</hi> was one of the Popes Heads, if he be the Beaſt: Was the firſt Beaſt but one of the many Heads of the ſecond Beaſt? Or, was the Heathen Religion but one of Heathen <hi>Rome</hi>'s own Heads? Or, was the Pope's wounded Head in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before him? If the Heathen <hi>Rome</hi> or its Heatheniſm, was the wounded Head of the firſt Beaſt, then the Pope was not the firſt Beaſt, for that was not one of his Heads, eſpecially at its overthrow by <hi>Conſtantine. Grot.</hi> and Dr. <hi>H.</hi> that ſay the ſecond beaſt is <hi>Apollonius,</hi> or Magicians, or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick, if they ſoconfine it, ſpeak as improbably. Whoever was the ſecond, his Lamb-like Horns ſhew him to be an Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite pretending to Truth, &amp; his Dragon-like Speech ſhew him to be the Devil's Agent. But the Reaſons to prove both one, being againſt the plain Text, ſome think ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that the firſt Beaſt was the Idolatrous Emperours
<pb facs="tcp:66325:289"/>
that ſo cruelly ſet up Image-worſhip, in the Eaſt and Weſt, and the Pope the ſecond Beaſt that flattered them, and rebelliouſly excommunicated thoſe that were againſt them; and his firſt notable Power was obtained by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging himſelf in the cauſe of the Image-worſhippers, and extolling and flattering them; and withal flattering <hi>Pipin,</hi> and <hi>Ch.

               <p rend="small">And ſome think that the Pope is the firſt Beaſt, and the ſecond are his Councils, and Cardinals, and Clergy, and Jeſuits, and Fryars, that cry him up, and perſuade the World to obey and follow him, according to his uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal claim.</p>
               <p rend="small">And if the difficult Objections againſt all theſe laſt, ſhould incline us rather to think that it is the Heathen Empire that is the firſt Beaſt, I ſhould (by reviewing the Hiſtory of Fact) think that the ſecond Beaſt was (not <hi>Apollonius</hi> fabled of by <hi>Philoſtratus</hi> and <hi>Hierocles,</hi> but) the whole Gowned and Literate Tribe; <hi>Learning,</hi> and the pompous oſtentation of it, being then almoſt as much of the Glory, Pride, and Strength of <hi>Rome,</hi> as the Military Power: And I ſhall ſhew anon how ordinary it was for the firſt Beaſt, the Imperial Military Power, to arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate the name of God's, and to have Temples, Altars, and Sacrifices: And the ſecond Beaſt, Poets, Orators, Comedians, Philoſophers, Hiſtorians, as well as Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurs, and Southſayers, and Magicians, and Prieſts, all flattered and applauded theſe blaſphemous Emperours; and the great Learning of theſe men was ſet up againſt Chriſtianity, as deſpiſed fooliſhneſs: As they did with <hi>Paul</hi> at <hi>Athens,</hi> so did the Learned <hi>Romans</hi> count Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians Bablers, and ignorant Barbarians: Learning (vain and carnal) was as great a glory to <hi>Rome</hi> as <hi>Arms,</hi> and it's doubtful whether the Imperial Power, or the Literate Oppoſition and Scorn, did more hinder the reception of Chriſtianity. But Chriſt and the Croſs at laſt conquered both, and uſed both to promote the Goſpel. Yet this might be ſaid to <hi>ariſe out of the Earth</hi>; for when it was uſed for enmity and ſtrife againſt Chriſt, it was fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with God, and as <hi>James</hi> ſaith, <hi>ch.</hi> 3. was earthly, ſenſual and deviliſh, cauſing confuſions, and every evil work.</p>

               <p rend="small">12. If it be the Heathen Empire that is ſpoken of, 1. Then it ſeemeth likeſt that the deadly wound was the ſhame and ſhaking of the Empire by the deaths of <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berius, Caligula, Claudius, Nero, Galba, Otho,</hi> and <hi>Vitellius</hi>; every Emperour, between <hi>Auguſtus</hi> and <hi>Veſpaſian,</hi> mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by others or themſelves; and the Suſpenſion of <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> at firſt, (or afterward the ſhake that Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſm had there by the Wiſdom and Honeſty of the <hi>Antonines,</hi> and after of <hi>Alexander Severus,</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi>) yet the firſt ſoon repaired by <hi>Veſpaſian, Titus</hi> and <hi>Domitian,</hi> and all the reſt at laſt by <hi>Diocleſian</hi> (after <hi>Decius, Aure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian, &amp;c.</hi>) And the Learned Tribe did live in Power, and in their Senate, and all their City-Officers, exerciſe ſuch ſplendid Pomp and Rule, as the Emperour did in his place: And cauſed the <hi>Roman</hi> City and Empire to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip their victorious blaſphemous Emperours, and with them to continue the common Idolatry.</p>

               <p rend="small">14.

               <p rend="small">About this name and number the Fathers, Papiſts, and Proteſtants, are of many minds among themſelves. The firſt generall difference is, whether it ſignifie the <hi>name</hi> of a Man properly, or only ſome <hi>other mark</hi> that belongeth to him, called his name? And the next whether the name belong to a <hi>ſingle perſon,</hi> or to a <hi>ſtate,</hi> or <hi>policy,</hi> or <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>? Of the Proteſtants many think its a <hi>mans name,</hi> but belonging to the <hi>Papacy</hi> in Common: <hi>Junius</hi> taketh it for the Canon Law and Decretalls; <hi>Broughton</hi> for <hi>Adonikam, Ezra</hi> 2.13 <hi>Bright man</hi> reciteth theſe, and divers names, found out by divers fancies, <hi>Titan, Lampetis, Ninetes, Cacos, Odegos, Alethes, Blaberos, Palas, Baſcanos, Amnos, Adicos in Arethas, Eccleſia Italica</hi> and <hi>Romaghnus.</hi> All which he rejecteth, and faſteneth on that which <hi>Irenaeus</hi> choſe of old, which is <hi>Lateinos.</hi> And he thinks that this <hi>number of the name,</hi> to be received, was meant of the Greeks, who were brought to ſubmit to the <hi>Latin</hi> Church; And ſo all the Greeks that ſo ſubmit, receiving the <hi>number,</hi> are joined in the guilt and damnation with them that had the <hi>Mark,</hi> or the <hi>Name</hi> it ſelf.</p>
               <p rend="small">This is clear that all they, that only find out a <hi>name,</hi> or <hi>number,</hi> which are <hi>not impoſed,</hi> and by the <hi>ſubjects received,</hi> ſpeak not at all to the Text. It is only the <hi>receiving</hi> of the <hi>mark, name</hi> or <hi>number</hi> that is here mentioned: It is the ſubjects Badge. If the racked word <hi>Lateinos</hi> be uſed as added to Catholick, and put inſtead of <hi>Roman,</hi> it may reach the Papiſts, whoſe name and Badge now is to be [<hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks, as diſtinct from all others, that are but meer Chriſtian Catholicks.]</p>
               <p rend="small">But lately moſt Proteſtants take the number of the name to be but ſome characteriſtical acts or marks: Some ſay, It is the Syſteme of <hi>Papal</hi> corruptions in doctrine and worſhip; ſome (as Mr. <hi>Potter</hi>) make it the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of 25, as the ſquare root of ſix hundred ſixty ſix, and he largely tells us how many waies it ſuiteth <hi>Rome.</hi> But how is this number of 25 received as a Badge by reprobates?

               <p rend="small">On the other ſide, thoſe that appropriate all this to Heathen <hi>Rome,</hi> are not of one mind.

               <p rend="small">1. I heard a great Voice out of the Temple, ſending theſe angels to pour out the Vials, and execute God's Wrath.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And the firſt went and poured out his vial upon the earth: and there fell a noi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom and grievous ſore upon the men which had the mark of the beaſt, and upon them which worſhipped his image.</p>
               <p rend="small">2. Of the great Plague in wicked <hi>Commodus</hi>'s Reign (that killed, in <hi>Rome</hi> alone, two thouſand a day;) and of the like, in the Reign of ſeveral Perſecutors, even till <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s Reign; and of the Blood-ſhed and Fire, and the reſemblance of this; to the Plagues of <hi>Egypt:</hi> See Dr. <hi>H.</hi> on the Text, and <hi>Grotius</hi> before him. Others ſay, It is the Papiſts Torment of Conſcience, when Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery is fallen.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And the ſecond angel poured out his vial upon the ſea, and it became as the blood of a dead man: and every living ſoul died in the ſea. 4. And the third angel poured out his vial upon the rivers and fountains of waters, and they became blood.</p>
               <p rend="small">3, 4. That theſe ſignifie a progreſs of the ſame Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on the Idolaters, is clear: But whether, by the Sea, and the Rivers and Fountains, ſignifie things ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct, as many think; and which, of their many conjectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Significations, are right, I cannot ſay.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And I heard the angel of the waters ſay, Thou art righteous, O Lord, which art, and waſt, and ſhalt be, becauſe thou haſt judged thus:</p>
               <p rend="small">5. The Angel that executed God's Judgments on the Idolatrous Nations, performed it with Praiſe and Glory to God, for his Juſtice on perſecuting Idolaters.</p>
               <p rend="small">
                  <hi>Note</hi>; The Angels in Heaven were not ignorant of what God thus did on Earth: And as God's Mercy hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred not his Execution of Juſtice ſo their pity kept them not from triumphing over theſe deſtroyed Sinners, and giving God the Glory of their Puniſhment.</p>
               <p n="6">6. For they have ſhed the blood of ſaints and prophets, and thou haſt given them blood to drink, for they are worthy. 7. And I heard another out of the altar ſay, Even ſo, Lord God Almighty, true and righteous are thy judgments.</p>
               <p rend="small">6, 7. <hi>Na.</hi> God and Angels will rejoyce in the terrible Revenge of the Blood of Saints. 2.

               <p n="8">8. And the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the ſun, and power was given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him to ſcorch men with fire. 9. And men were ſcorched with great heat, and blaſphemed the name of God, which hath power over theſe plagues: and they repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not, to give him glory.</p>
               <p rend="small">8, 9. Some take this to ſignifie a great Drought, and Dearth, that came in the days of <hi>Commodus</hi>; and after, of <hi>Maximinus.</hi> Many take the Sun here, for Antichriſt, that calleth himſelf ſo: Others, for Governors: Some, for the King of <hi>Spain</hi>; ſome, for the <hi>German</hi> Emperor; or ſome ſuch Papal Luminary: Some, for the Scripture, as tormenting Papiſts: Some, for Chriſt, as ſending forth his Word and Judgments. I can go no further than the general ſure ſenſe; That a greater Plague, that fell on the Idolatrous Empire, made them lay all the blame on the Chriſtians, and rage the more; but cured not their Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, or Perſecution.</p>
               <p n="10">10. And the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the ſeat of the beaſt, and his kingdom was full of darkneſs, and they gnawed their tongues for pain, 11. And blaſphemed the God of heaven becauſe of their pains and their ſores, and repented not of their deeds.</p>
               <p rend="small">10, 11. The plain, general ſenſe of all this is, to liken Idolatrous, perſecuting <hi>Rome,</hi> and the ſuffering Chriſtians, to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and the <hi>Iſraelites</hi>; and liken God's Plagues on <hi>Rome,</hi> to the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Plagues: And to tell us that, as <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s heart was hardned till Deſtruction fell on him and his, ſo will be the Idolatrous <hi>Romans.</hi>

But ſome think, that this is but a further Aſſimilation of the Caſe to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> when the Red Sea was dryed up for their eſcape, and to prepare the way for <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s ruin: and ſignifieth, that the danger and impediments of the Chriſtians delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance were removed, by the Overthrow of all the Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>later's Forces, the Ruin of <hi>Diocleſian, Maxim.

ANd there came one of the ſeven an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels which had the ſeven vials, and talked with me, ſaying unto me, Come hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I will ſhew unto thee the judgment of the great whore, that ſitteth upon many waters: 2. With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, and the inhabiters of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication.</p>
               <p rend="small">1. Say ſome, 1. I will ſhew thee what is coming from God on Imperial, Heathen, Idolatrous <hi>Rome,</hi> who by <hi>Power</hi> and by <hi>Learning</hi> (by the firſt and ſecond Beaſt) hath drawn Kings and Nations with her to Idolatry.</p>
               <p rend="small">Others ſay, it is Papal <hi>Rome,</hi> and they prove it, becauſe if they had not been married to God before by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Chriſtianity, they could not have been Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers. To which the former ſay, 1. That Fornication may be the ſin of the unmarried. 2. That by Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is meant Idolatry, and God's right may ſerve to infer this guilt, though men be not married to him by conſent: And that it is incredible that all the Heathen World are no Idolaters, becauſe they were not profeſt Chriſtians. By the Whore is meant the ſame as the <hi>Woman,</hi> the ſecond two horned Beaſt; and the falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, ſay many, that is, the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> with the whole body of the <hi>Roman</hi> Clergy; which others deny.</p>

Into the Wilderneſs, ſay ſome, to repreſent the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation; ſay others, becauſe it was a Revelation not to be yet openly known in the City, for if the Rulers had known of all theſe terrible Predictions againſt them, they would have raged by Perſecution againſt Chriſtians; and therefore all this Prophecy was to be obſcure, and not communicated long ſo commonly as other Scriptures. Others ſay, it was to ſhew that Antichriſt's Kingdom is barren, without a drop of grace: Others, that ſolitude is fitteſt for contemplation: Others, that the Wilderneſs is Heatheniſm brought in by Popery; Others, that as the true Church was driven into a Wilderneſs of ſolitude and ſuffering, ſo now ſhall Papiſts be: Others, that the Papacy is a Wilderneſs, as an Apoſtatical Church ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding the Apoſtolick Church.</p>

               <p rend="small">5. The name written was [Myſtery, <hi>Babylon, &amp;c.</hi>] that is, <hi>Myſtical</hi> (not literal) <hi>Babylon, the Great City</hi> Rome, <hi>the Mother of Idolatry and Wickedneſs, propagating them, by her Power and Learning, to all the Nations of her Dominions, and further in the World.</hi> As <hi>Babylon</hi> was the Idolatrous, cruel, Captivator of the Ancient Jews, overthrowing their Kingdom; ſo was Idolatrous, proud <hi>Rome,</hi> the Captiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor and Perſecutor of Jew and Gentile Chriſtians, and the great Enemy of the Church.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And I ſaw the woman drunken with the blood of the ſaints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jeſus: and when I ſaw her, I wondered with great admiration.</p>

               <p rend="small">1. The Fall of <hi>Rome</hi> is ſo great a work that it was foreſhewed me, as by an Angel of wondrous Glory. Thoſe that tell us that this Angel was an eminent preacher, and ſuch other particularities of filling the earth with his Glory, go further than my knowledge goeth.</p>

               <p rend="small">2. The Language of thoſe times was to call deferred ruined places where no man dwelt, the places haunted
<pb facs="tcp:66325:295"/>
by Devils, and Goblins, and Satyrs and Owls and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents. So that this ſignifieth <hi>Deſolation</hi>: And the <hi>Jews</hi> then thinking that, as <hi>Babylon</hi> that before captivated them is deſtroyed, ſo the very City of <hi>Rome</hi> would be; the Prophecy calleth the <hi>Deſtruction</hi> of the <hi>Pagan</hi> Empire and Idolatry, with all its retinue of Literate upholders, by the name and titles of the Deſtruction of the City. For it was not <hi>Babylon,</hi> as a City, nor <hi>quâ Roma,</hi> as this City, nor as a Rich and Great City, But <hi>as</hi> the Great <hi>Idolatrous Power which captivated</hi> and <hi>perſecuted</hi> the <hi>Church</hi>; Therefore it is deſtroyed, not as a Great or Rich City, but as <hi>Babylon</hi>: And ſo it is deſolate. Some think that this is ſpoken of it, as when <hi>Rome</hi> was burnt in part by <hi>Totilas,</hi> and the remnant of <hi>Pagans</hi> deſtroyed by <hi>Alaricus:</hi> That's more than I can prove. But it being the <hi>Pagan</hi> Empire, that captivated the Church, that made it <hi>Babylon,</hi> I think <hi>Babylon</hi> fell when that fell, though many <hi>Pagans</hi> did ſurvive.</p>
               <p n="3">3. For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication with her, and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich, through the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of her delicacies.</p>
               <p rend="small">3. For their Power and Learning have ſpred the poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or drunkenneſs, of their Idolatry to all nations, and the Kings of the earth have been encouraged in the guilt; and her wealth and grandeur, have promoted all pride and ſenſuality in the nations, that have traded with her, or depended on her. Others ſay, It is the ſale of pardons, indulgences, and Ceremonies and Church-preferments, that are her Merchandize and delicacies.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And I heard another voice from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, ſaying, Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her ſins, and that ye receive not of her plagues. 5. For her ſins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembred her iniquities.</p>
               <p rend="small">4, 5. That is, Away from Idolatrous Pagan <hi>Rome,</hi> as <hi>Lot</hi> fled from <hi>Sodom</hi>; if you love your lives and Souls avoid all partaking in her ſins: Eat not things offered to idols, imitate them not, and comply not with them in any act of Idolatry, or other ſin: For the time of her deſtruction is at hand, and you may ſuffer with her if you ſin with her, and fly not from her.</p>
               <p rend="small">Or, Come out from Popery, and partake not of the ſin, leſt you partake of the plagues. Here, ſay ſome Proteſtants, we anſwer the queſtion, Where was your Church before <hi>Luther</hi>? And why do you ſeparate from Popery? To the firſt, ſay they, our Church was in <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> where God bore with it, till he call'd it out: To the ſecond, God commanded us to come out. No doubt, we muſt partake of no mens ſins.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Reward her even as ſhe rewarded you, and double unto her double, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to her works: in the cup which ſhe hath filled, fill to her double.</p>
               <p rend="small">6. God, who is her Judge, will have you lay doubly more on her than ſhe laid on you by perſecution: And this is no injuſtice; it being for ſin againſt him, and not only as againſt you. This giveth the reaſon of Gods execution by <hi>Conſtantine</hi>; but alloweth no private men to take arms againſt Government, on pretence of reveng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the injuries of the Church.</p>
               <p n="7">7. How much ſhe hath glorified her ſelf, and lived deliciouſly, ſo much torment and ſorrow give her: for ſhe ſaith in her heart, I ſit a queen, and am no widdow, and ſhall ſee no ſorrow.</p>
               <p rend="small">7.

               <p n="8">8. Therefore ſhall her plagues come in one day, death, and mourning, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine; and ſhe ſhall be utterly burnt with fire: for ſtrong is the Lord God who judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth her.</p>
               <p rend="small">8. The Fall of the Pagan Empire ſhall be ſudden and terrible, like the burning of a City.

Standing afar off for the fear of her torment ſaying, Alas, alas, that great city Babylon, that mighty city! for in one hour is thy judgment come.</p>

               <p rend="small">17, 18, 19.

Or, ſay others, The Fall of <hi>Rome</hi> Papal was thus repreſented: But others ſay, that <hi>Rome</hi> Papal ſhall be thus really burnt and deſtroyed.</p>
               <p n="20">20. Rejoice over her, thou heaven, and ye holy apoſtles and prophets, for God hath avenged you on her.</p>

The reſt of the dead, even the ſubdued Pagans, (or Papiſts, ſay others.) were kept as in a ſtate of death, out of power, till the Dragon revived their power again a thouſand years after.

As in the proſperous Church militant, everlaſting life is open, and given to all accepters, by the Doctrine of the Apoſtles, and continually repreſented and conferred in the Sacraments, and by the Word, the Spirit of Chriſt accompanying his Ordinances, the Preaching of the Word is for the healing of the unbelievers and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted: So, in the New <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> where the end of all his is attained the Glory is repreſented by the means that are paſt, that brought them thither, by which men were ſanctified, and the Nations healed; the means be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eminently (though not formally) in the attained end.

            <p>I Here give you notice, (which I deſire you not to forget in the reading of this Paraphraſe,) that it is but ſome General Notes, and not a proper Expoſition of the <hi>Revelations,</hi> which I offer you. And that I here confeſs to you, that very much of it I underſtand not: And if this offend any, that ſay I ſhould have better ſtudied it. I only ſay, 1. That you <hi>ſuffer fools gladly, ſeeing your ſelves are wiſe.</hi> 2. That I am far below <hi>Dionyſius Alexandrinus,</hi> and moſt of the Ancient Fathers, even <hi>Auguſtine</hi> himſelf, who profeſſed that they underſtood it not: Yea incomparable <hi>Calvin</hi> profeſſeth that he underſtood not the <hi>Thouſandth Part</hi> of it; And his Part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner <hi>Beza</hi> would give us little of it, next to none: And both refuſed to write a Comment on it. 3. I honour them that know more than I, and contradict them not: I had rather ſay too little (where other men have ſaid enough) than ſay more than I know. 4. It is not through meer <hi>ſloth,</hi> that I am ignorant: Women and Boys think they know herein what I do not, who have ſtudied it leſs than I, but I confeſs that Deſpair is much of the cauſe. Forty four years ago, when I was but young, I ſtudied it (I doubt too ſoon) and read <hi>Brightman, Napier, Pareus,</hi> &amp;c. and after that <hi>Mede, Potter,</hi> and many more, beſides ſuch Treatiſes, as <hi>Downamus de Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſto, Broughton,</hi> and other ſuch, beſides the anſwerers of <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> &amp;c. I met with many Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines and Lay-men, who had choſen it out for the chief ſtudy of their Lives, and I found ſo great diverſity of Opinions, five of the moſt confident going four ways, and ſo little proof of what they moſt confidently aſſerted, that I deſpaired of being ſo much wiſer then they, as to come to ſatisfaction, if I ſhould lay by more neceſſary ſtudies, and make this the buſineſs of the reſt of my Life, which yet I durſt not do. Afterwards I converſt with my fellow Labourer, Mr. <hi>Nath. Stephens,</hi> who hath written of it, and was much upon it in his diſcourſe, but I durſt not be drawn to a deep ſtudy of it: And when ſince I read Mr. <hi>Durham,</hi> Dr. <hi>Moor,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>Grotius,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> and many Annotators, I confeſs deſpair, and more needful buſineſs, made me do it but ſuperficially: And when I had for my own uſe written the reſt of this Paraphraſe on the New Teſtament, I propoſed to have ſaid nothing of any more of the Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, than of the three firſt Chapters, profeſſing that I underſtood it not. But after, being loth to <hi>omit wholly</hi> any part of the New Teſtament, and thinking that the renewed ſtudy of that, which ſpeaketh ſo much of the New <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> might be ſuitable to a pained dying man, I thought of it more ſearchingly than I had done heretofore, but have not now either the ſtrength of Wit, or length of time, that are neceſſary to ſo hard a work, and therefore pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume not to oppoſe others, but refer the Readers to them that have more throughly ſtudied and expounded it, than I can do: But yet I thought that thoſe Generals, which I underſtood, might be uſeful to unlearned Readers, though they made them no wiſer than I am my ſelf; while thoſe, that are above me, have enough higher to read.</p>
            <p>If any be offended that I name ſo many mens Opinions; I anſwer them, 1. Had I known which of them was right, I would have mentioned that only: But when I know it not, (and their difference tells us that they know it not themſelves,) how can I honeſtly be ſo partial as to name one, and paſs by all the reſt? And how ſhould I know which that one muſt be? When <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi> had given us the Expoſition of much of it, he plainly tells us, that theſe are other mens Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but he thinketh them improbable, and if ever he come to underſtand it himſelf, he will tell us the true meaning; which if he had not ſaid, I ſhould have thought that <hi>Lira deliraſſet,</hi> though the ſaying be, <hi>Si Lira non Liraſſet, totus mundus deliraſſet.</hi> My Friend, Mr. <hi>Matth. Pool,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:66325:300"/>
in his <hi>Synopſis,</hi> hath recited greater diverſity of Opinions than I have done; where the arguments for them may be partly ſeen, which my ſhort notes muſt not take in.</p>
            <p>The points which are too hard for me, are theſe eſpecially.</p>

            <p n="1">I. As to the firſt, I long took it for granted, that Antichriſt is here ſpoken of, even the ſame mentioned by <hi>John</hi> in his Epiſtle, and by <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.2. But, to my admiration when I ſearcht, I could find neither the name of Antichriſt, nor an aſcertaining deſcription of him; ſo that I began to think better of the moſt Learned Judicious <hi>Hierom. Zanchy,</hi> who took <hi>Mahomet</hi> to be the Antichriſt, though the Popes Crimes might allow us to take him for one of thoſe other Antichriſts, of whom <hi>John</hi> ſaith there were many. And if any find him here characterized, as called <hi>the Beaſt, the falſe Prophet, or the Whore,</hi> I will crave his pardon, for my chooſing to take up with the Scripture Names. I am not wiſer than the Revealer of theſe things, in naming ſuch as he here ſpeaketh of; why are not the Names here given us ſufficient? I will explain the word [<hi>Antichriſt</hi>] where I find it; and the words, [<hi>Beaſt, falſe Prophet, Whore,</hi> &amp;c.] where I find them. I dread fiction and addition. Of the Deſcription I ſhall ſpeak after.</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>Who is the firſt Beaſt,</hi> is of great importance, of which I find many opinions: Thoſe of the Fathers, and the Papiſts, I paſs by: Theſe now among us ſtand chiefly in competition. 1. Thoſe that ſay, it is the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire as containing both the Pagan, and the Papal State: 2. Thoſe that ſay, it is the Papal Civil Power only, as upheld by Popiſh Princes, the ten Kings: 3. Thoſe that ſay, it is only the Papacy, or <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> who is the firſt Beaſt, as in Civil power, and the ſecond, in Eccleſiaſtical. 4. Thoſe that ſay, it is only the Pagan Empire. (Others I paſs by that ſay, 5. It is the <hi>Greeks</hi> Eaſtern Empire; 6. Or the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Empire; 7. Or a future unknown <hi>Antichriſt</hi>; 8. Or the Devil.)</p>
            <p n="1">I. Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> ſaith, the firſt is the common opinion, but not true, he is for the ſecond; and Mr. <hi>Durham,</hi> and many of late, for the third, and all of them againſt the 4th. I ſhall not further mention their reaſons againſt each other, but only thoſe that are brought for the Papacy, either alone, or with its ſupports, and thoſe that are brought againſt the 4th opinion; (which is for the Pagan Empire.)</p>
            <p n="1">I. They ſay that the firſt Beaſt muſt needs be the Papacy (or its ſupports.) 1. Becauſe <hi>John</hi> ſaw the riſing of it, ſo that it was then to come: But Pagan <hi>Rome</hi> was before. 2. Becauſe he ſucce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſeth the Dragon in his Seat. 3. It is the Pope that owneth the names of Blaſphemy. 4. He is adored. 5. He only healeth the wounded head. 6. He is contemporary with the ten Kings with crowned horns. 7. He is contemporary with <hi>Babylon,</hi> which is Papal <hi>Rome.</hi> 8. All the Texts agree to Papal <hi>Rome.</hi> 9. He is Antichriſt, who is to ſit in the Temple of God. 10. That which hindred, was to be removed before his Revelation, which was the Empire as Pagan.</p>
            <p n="2">II. And they ſay, it cannot be the Pagan Empire. 1. Becauſe that was riſen long before. 2. Becauſe it was not that Power, which was the ſixth head, but the ſeventh and eight, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended
<pb facs="tcp:66325:301"/>
out of the bottomleſs pit, with whom the ten Kings were to receive Kingdoms. 3. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Pagan Empire was not contemporary with <hi>Babylon.</hi> 4. This Beaſt was to continue 1260 years, whereas the Pagan Empire continued but 360. 5. It had not the ten crowned horns. 6. The Roman Pagan Empire was lawfully obeyed, being of God, but ſo is not the Beaſt. 7. The things ſaid <hi>Chap.</hi> 19. agree not with it.</p>
            <p>And here the ſixth doubt is coincident, <hi>what is the Whore</hi>? For if it be only Papal <hi>Rome,</hi> then, ſay they, the Pope is the Beaſt. And this they prove. 1. Becauſe it is a myſtery, which Heathen Idolatry was not. 2. Antichriſt ſits in the Temple of God. 3. Becauſe it is that <hi>Rome,</hi> that muſt be for ever deſolate, and a place for Devils and Serpents &amp;c. 4. The fall of <hi>Babylon</hi> was to be, after the faithful were come out of it: 5. Pagan <hi>Rome</hi> ſold not Souls, nor made the Nations drunk with the Cup of her Fornication. 6. She was not married to Chriſt, and therefore could be no adultreſs. 7. She had no falſe Prophet, as here deſcribed, to ſeduce and work Miracles, but did all by force &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="2">II. But becauſe it is an advantage to the Reader, to know the Judgment of men in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion of the parts, and Mr. <hi>Brightman</hi> ſeemeth to have done his Work, with as Pious a Zeal and as great Learning and deep ſtudy as any man, I ſhall ſum up his opinion about this matter, Having on <hi>Daniel</hi> ſtrongly proved (after <hi>Calvin</hi>) that the paſſages, commonly expounded of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus</hi> are miſtaken, he ſaith that it is the Romans Power that they mean, who were above all called Gods, that is, all Princes, and that the <hi>Abomination</hi> (not <hi>making,</hi> but) <hi>made</hi> Deſolate, was the utterly caſting out the old Jewiſh Temple-Worſhip, which was good till abrogate, and Abominable afterward: That this was done by the deſtruction of the Temple, but perfected in <hi>Julians</hi> time, by Gods overthrowing it, when he attempted to re-edifie it. And on <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. And forward he ſaith, 1. That Antichriſt, the Pope, is both the firſt and ſecond Beaſt, and <hi>Latinos</hi> his name, &amp;c. 2. That the firſt 1000 years began with <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> who was the Man-child, and bound the Dragon. 3. The binding him is that he ſhall no more ſet up Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſm. 4. But Antichriſt began at the ſame time, and reigned al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the while that the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon was bound, even from <hi>Conſtantine</hi>; And the Church was in the Wilderneſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. 5. The firſt Reſurrection began 1300 when <hi>Marſil. Patavinus, Wickliff,</hi> and others, began Reformation (But I am perſwaded that thoſe, after called <hi>Albigenſes,</hi> and before <hi>Bagandoe,</hi> were before <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine; Reynerius</hi> confeſſeth that they called themſelves <hi>Apoſtolicks,</hi> and ſaid they were from <hi>Silveſters,</hi> that is, <hi>Conſtantines</hi> time: Why then is <hi>Wickliff</hi> (who hath many errors) ſet above them?) 6. The reſt of the Dead in Popery roſe not by Reformation. 7. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond death is Hell fire. 8. A ſecond 1000 years, of Church Reformation and Proſperity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan then at 1300, when the Dragon was let looſe: Antichriſt began at his binding, and the happy 1000 years Reformation at his looſing. 9. His looſing ſet up the <hi>Turk, Gog</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gog, (Scythians,)</hi> to a War againſt the Saints. 10. The Camp of the Saints was <hi>Europe.</hi> 11. The Holy City was the Converted Jews, and the place of the War in <hi>Judea,</hi> where the <hi>Turks</hi> ſhall wonderfully be utterly deſtroyed, (by <hi>Michael</hi> the Angel of the <hi>Jews.</hi>) 12. The Beaſt that deceived the <hi>Turk,</hi> is the <hi>Turk</hi> himſelf. 13. The Beaſt, and falſe Prophet in Hell with him, is Antichriſt, who falls a little before him. 14. The Judgment and ſecond Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, Chap. 20.11. are the full reſtoring of the <hi>Jews.</hi> 15. The <hi>Dead, ſmall</hi> and <hi>great, judged</hi> are the <hi>Jews,</hi> that till now rejected Chriſt. 16. The Sea and Earth giving up their Dead, are all Countrys ſending home the <hi>Jews</hi> converted. 17. Death and Hell, caſt into the Lake, are <hi>Turks</hi> and Papiſt that ſhall detain the <hi>Jews</hi> no longer. 18. The Thrones and Reign of thoſe dead, is the deſtruction of their Enemies on Earth. 19. Only elect <hi>Jews</hi> ſhall be in that Church: 20. What the firſt Heaven and Earth is, that ſhall be done away, he doth not know, but thinks it is the old Jewiſh way of Worſhip, which ſhall ceaſe as their converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. 21. <hi>No more Sea, is no more falſe Doctrine</hi> 22. <hi>No more Death,</hi> is no more ſharp pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, and that the ſting of death ſhall be taken out: 23. And the new Glorious <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> deſcribed in the 21. and 22. Chapters, in this City or Church of the Converted <hi>Jews</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:66325:301"/>
at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the reſt being reſtored with them. Why I incline to Learned Mr. <hi>Calverts</hi> op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that the converſion of the <hi>Jews</hi> is long ago paſt, the obſtinate <hi>Jews</hi> being moſtly deſtroyed by <hi>Titus</hi> and <hi>Adrian,</hi> and the Chriſtian <hi>Jews</hi> being very numerous quickly, and all, that ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Judea,</hi> as much made the Kingdom of Chriſt, by Profeſſion, in the days of <hi>Cyril, Juve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> and after, when their Country was repleniſhed with Biſhops, Churches and Monaſteries, and many abroad ſince then Converted, (as <hi>Lira, Tremellius</hi> and others were,) as other Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Kingdoms were, (where ſome ſtill are Infidels, I have ſhewed on <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.)</p>
            <p>But the moſt wonderful part of the expected Miracle is, that all theſe Thouſands, if not Millions of <hi>Jews,</hi> that live ſcattered through the World, and now are the moſt vile, and Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous, ignorant and worldly Perſons, living among <hi>Turks,</hi> and Papiſts, where they hear not the Goſpel, ſhould all without Preaching or Teaching be not only Converted at once, but made, ſuch Wiſe and excellent Chriſtians, as are fitter to conſtitute a Glorious Church, than we that have bin taught ſo long. If God have promiſed that not only a Nation, but a New <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſhould be thus born, or come down from Heaven, in a day, it muſt be believed: But doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it will be a Miracle incomparably excelling all that Chriſt and his Apoſtles did; yea Milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Miracles at once: And therefore we may expect ſuch proof as faith needeth in ſo ſtrange a caſe. And as God is no reſpecter of Perſons, ſo the <hi>Jews</hi> never proved, ſince <hi>Abrahams</hi> days, under the Law, under Judges or Kings, or ſince, ſo wiſe or excellent a People, as may prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſticate ſuch Advancement. And God uſeth to work by means, Chriſt and his Apoſtles con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted none without the Word: And <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>how ſhall they believe on him, of whom they have not heard? and how ſhall they hear, without a preacher, and how ſhall they Preach, unleſs they be ſent?</hi> And theſe expoſitors tell us not that Preachers ſhall be ſent to the ſcattered <hi>Jews,</hi> into all <hi>Turkiſh</hi> and Papiſts Lands, to learn the Languages, and convert them at once. It is worth the Readers peruſal, <hi>c.</hi> 7. p. 217. how he juſtly derideth <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> as ſuppoſing that Antichriſt will put down Gods Worſhip in all the Earth, telling him that he hath an hundred forty eight Thouſand Thouſand times five hundred fifty Thouſand nine hundred and nine Miles to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, to do it, (and ſo much have Univerſal Popes and Councils, to take charge of,) which will hardly be done in three years and a half: And yet killing mens Souls is a leſs work than to make them alive.</p>
            <p>Its doleful to think what Satan hath gained by corrupting the Church, by wicked Biſhops, making that his Game, when Pagan Power fell; partly by tempting in Worldly wicked men by Wealth and Honour, and partly by making Ungodly Princes the chooſers of Biſhops, (and Ungodly Patrons the chooſers of Prieſts,) and when men ruled by Satan chooſe them, Satan himſelf oft chooſeth them: Who, by their wickedneſs, Malignity and Perſecuting the beſt men, have tempted thoſe Chriſtians, who moſt hate ſin, to call almoſt all the Church Antichriſtian, and fly from it as worſe than Pagan <hi>Rome,</hi> and to loſe much of their Love to all that are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by ſuch abhorred names. Had the Paſtors of the Church bin all Holy, Humble men of Love, and not men of Wickedneſs and Blood, their Power and Intereſt would have bin the Joy of Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men. But enough of that ſide.</p>
            <p n="2">II. On the other ſide, they that ſay the contrary, thus expreſs their ſenſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>firſt Beaſt</hi> is the <hi>Roman Imperial</hi> and <hi>Military Power,</hi> not <hi>as ſuch,</hi> but as the <hi>Grand Power of Idolatry,</hi> firſt, and next, as the <hi>Captivator</hi> and <hi>Perſecutor of the Chriſtian Church,</hi> of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Image</hi> of the <hi>Beaſt</hi> is both the Idol Statues, Images, and Altars of their <hi>Idol Gods,</hi> and of <hi>themſelves,</hi> both which by their Laws were to be worſhipped with Sacrifices, and other acts of Idolatry.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The ſecond Beaſt is the <hi>Senate</hi> with all the Literate Idolaters and Flatterers, Orators, Philoſophers, Prieſts, Poets, <hi>Comedians, Augurs,</hi> &amp;c. as Learned defenders of Idolatry, and repro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>chers, and Enemies of Chriſtianity.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The <hi>name</hi> of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> was the <hi>name of the Idol God,</hi> whom they were to Worſhip, and
<pb facs="tcp:66325:302"/>
of the <hi>Idolized Emperours,</hi> as called <hi>Divi</hi> and <hi>Dii,</hi> and honoured by Altars and Sacrifices.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The <hi>Mark</hi> was a <hi>Stigma,</hi> or Badge, then uſually received by Servants, and Souldiers, and Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries, as an obliging mark of ſubjection.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The number of the name was ſome abbreviating Letters, part of the mark, and here proved to be numeral; though, at this diſtance, we cannot ſay what they were, nor whether ſtill the ſame.</p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>Receiving</hi> the <hi>mark</hi> is <hi>profeſt conſent,</hi> and uſually by ſuch a Badge.</p>
            <p n="8">8. The <hi>Woman Whore</hi> was the <hi>City of Rome,</hi> not meerly as a <hi>City,</hi> or as <hi>Rome,</hi> or as <hi>Rich,</hi> or as <hi>Powerful,</hi> but as <hi>Idolatrous</hi> and <hi>captivating</hi> the Church.</p>
            <p n="9">9. The <hi>Witneſſes</hi> were the <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile,</hi> Chriſtian Teachers, Prophets, <hi>Miracle-workers</hi> and Martyrs, that had the ſpirit, as the firſt Chriſtians had, for ſignal Teſtimony to the Goſpel, Miracles long continuing in ſome degree. Theſe are their expoſitions.</p>
            <p>Their Reaſons they begin firſt of the <hi>Whore</hi>; or the ſeat of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> which they ſay muſt needs be Pagan <hi>Rome.</hi> 1. Becauſe it was expreſly ſaid by the Angel, who purpoſely explained it to be, <hi>the great City which ruleth over the Kings of the Earth.</hi> 1. Not a <hi>Church</hi> which is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Princes, but properly <hi>a City.</hi> 2. Not only pretenders to a Power of Church Keys; but proper Rulers by Power of Armes. 3. Not only over the Church, (oft called Heaven,) but over the <hi>Kings of the Earth,</hi> (noting thoſe <hi>without.</hi>) 4. Not [<hi>ſhall Rule</hi>] but <hi>doth Rule,</hi> as a viſible note, by which <hi>John might know the Whore.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This being ſo plain, that only violence can obſcure it, may be, ſay they, a Key to all the reſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Ch.</hi> 17.2. The Kings of the Earth had at <hi>that time</hi> committed Fornication with her; and the Inhabitants of the Earth were <hi>then</hi> drunken with the Wine of her Fornication, elſe it could not be to <hi>John</hi> a notifying mark. But the Papacy was not of many hundred years after in being.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>John</hi> was brought into the Wilderneſs to ſee it, which was the then Perſecuted State of the Church: And it was to comfort him and that Church, in hope of a near Deliverance; for they were things that <hi>muſt ſhortly be done.</hi>
            </p>

            <p n="2">2. The ſeven Heads of the Beaſt, had the name of Blaſphemy. But if the heads were the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſpecies of Government, the name of Papal Blaſphemy, was not on ſix of them at leaſt, but only of Pagan Blaſphemy: Therefore it was Pagan <hi>Rome,</hi> or its Empire, that they headed.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The ſeven Pagan ſorts of Government, were not ſeven Heads of the Papacy, or <hi>Roman</hi> Church; therefore the Papacy, or <hi>Roman</hi> Church, was not the Beaſt: For they were the Heads of the Beaſt. And the <hi>wounding</hi> of one of the Heads, ſhews that all the ſeven were Heads of one, and the ſame Beaſt.</p>
            <p n="4">4. [<hi>Who is able to make War with the Beaſt</hi>?] tells us, that it was by Arms that he ſtood, and not by mere Hypocriſy and deceit. That was the part of the ſecond Beaſt, and not of the firſt.</p>

            <p n="7">7. The Dwellers on the Earth worſhipped the <hi>firſt Beaſt, whoſe deadly wound was healed,</hi> c. 13.12. But it was not the Pope, nor the Papal <hi>Rome,</hi> or Church, whoſe deadly wound was healed, in the Judgment of all them, that ſays, the very erecting of the Papacy was the heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that Wound: For it was not wounded as a head, before it was in being. And if it was Pagan <hi>Rome,</hi> or Idolatry, that the Papacy healed, then the <hi>healed,</hi> and not the <hi>healing</hi> party, was the firſt Beaſt.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Its contrary to divers expreſs Texts, that the firſt and ſecond Beaſt are the ſame: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they, that make the Pope the ſecond, muſt acknowledge another to be the firſt.</p>
            <p n="9">9. The number of a man, <hi>received,</hi> cannot be found of Papal <hi>Rome.</hi>

            <p n="10">10.

            <p>Further that it is <hi>Pagan Rome</hi> that is the <hi>Whore,</hi> and its <hi>Empire,</hi> as <hi>Idolatrous</hi> and <hi>captivating,</hi> that is the <hi>firſt Beaſt,</hi> and not the <hi>Papacy,</hi> they argue thus.</p>
            <p>If it be Papal <hi>Rome,</hi> it is either the <hi>City</hi> as building and place, or it is the <hi>Policie.</hi> 1. Not the <hi>place</hi> called the City; for it is good as ſuch. 2.

               <pb facs="tcp:66325:303"/>2.

            <p n="3">3. It is not Empire meerly, as found in a perſon of <hi>bad Qualities</hi> and Life: For then every wicked Emperour and King would be the Beaſt, (or their Antichriſt,) and a Pope, that were not perſonally vicious, would be none.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It is not every Emperor or King, that is an <hi>Uſurper</hi> or invader: For then many Emperours would be the Beaſt.</p>

            <p n="6">6. It is not every one, that in <hi>Church Power</hi> would be <hi>higheſt,</hi> for then <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John</hi> would have bin Antichriſts; and ſo would many Biſhops of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> and <hi>Alexandria</hi>; if not many in moſt other lands among the ſeveral parties of Chriſtians.</p>
            <p n="7">7. It is not every one that pretendeth to, and Uſurpeth, a ſort of Power that God never giveth: For ſo do many Impoſers of moſt parties.</p>
            <p n="8">8. It is not every one that joineth Civil and Eccleſiaſtical Power in one perſon: For ſo did <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chizedeck</hi>; and ſo did <hi>Cyril,</hi> and other <hi>Alexandrian</hi> Biſhops, and thoſe of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and what Epiſcopal Countrys have not ſuch? If you ſay, that this is a Kin to Antichriſtianity, or preparatory, I ſay, our queſtion is not <hi>What is</hi> a Kin, or preparatory, but what is it, that formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſtituteth it?</p>
            <p n="9">9. It is not every one that is a <hi>Perſecutor</hi>; for ſo alas have been too many in moſt times and places, nor is it all that promote hereſie or Blaſphemy by Perſecution. For ſo did <hi>Valens,</hi> and many <hi>Arrian</hi> Kings (and Councils,) <hi>Genſericus, Hunnericus, Theodoricus, Odoacer,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="10">10. It is not all that were Idolaters in any degree, for ſo is now four ſixth parts of the World: Much leſs all inward Heart-idolaters; as are all that are Covetous, and love the World better than God, and obey man againſt him. Nor is it all that give Saints or Angels undue or ſinful Veneration: for ſo <hi>John</hi> twice offered proſtration to the Angel: At leaſt, ſo did the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> to the Images of Saints, and eſpecially the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi>: And ſo did many of the Eaſtern Emperours, and <hi>Tharaſius</hi> drew in almoſt all the Eaſtern Biſhops; yea many were faulty long before Popery came in.</p>
            <p n="11">11. It is not the <hi>being</hi> of any of theſe at <hi>Rome,</hi> that conſtituteth the Beaſt or Antichriſt, which would not do it elſewhere; For <hi>Theodorick, Odoacer,</hi> and other <hi>Arrians,</hi> Blaſphemers of Chriſt, and Perſecutors in <hi>Rome,</hi> were not the Beaſt or Antichriſt. It muſt therefore (ſay theſe men) be ſomewhat differing from all theſe; which we can find in Pagan <hi>Rome,</hi> but not in Papal. If the ſame thing will make the Pope, (and all Papiſts,) to be the beaſt, that would not make ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch, there muſt be ſome ſpecial reaſon for it.</p>
            <p n="12">12.

The <hi>Empire</hi> was not ſetled at <hi>Rome,</hi> but at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> when Chriſtianity came in power, 2. The Popes were moſt Martyrs and Sufferers till <hi>Conſtantines</hi> time; and long after profeſſed ſubjection to Emperours, yea even to <hi>Arrians,</hi> and to Uſurpers: And <hi>Alexandria</hi> and <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> uſed as much <hi>force</hi> as they. It was 606 years before <hi>Phocas</hi> called <hi>Boniface</hi> the 3. the Univerſal Biſhop; by which he never meant, the Univerſal <hi>Emperour</hi> or <hi>Civil Governour</hi>: (No nor Univerſal Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical any further than the Empire.) It was long after this, that the claim of depoſing Kings as Excommunicate, was ſet on foot by <hi>Gregory</hi> the ſeventh; and long after that, before it was determined in the <hi>Lateran</hi> Council. Moſt Chriſtian Kingdoms oppoſed it all along: <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour, and <hi>William Rufus,</hi> and others, in <hi>England: Philip,</hi> and others, in <hi>France,</hi> where it is denyed to this day, and much in <hi>Spain:</hi> The <hi>German</hi> Emperours, <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth and fifth; and <hi>Frederick</hi> and <hi>Otho</hi> long fought againſt it, and ſome of them took <hi>Rome,</hi> made and unmade Popes,
<pb facs="tcp:66325:303"/>
and uſed them as their Subjects. The Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> themſelves, were from age to age almoſt always in War againſt the Popes: The Eaſtern Emperours before maſtered them, till <hi>Pipin,</hi> and the two <hi>Charles'</hi> uſed the Papacy to uſurp; the Empire, and after were Maſters of the Pope themſelves: The very Citizens and Laity of <hi>Rome,</hi> from age to age, ſtrove with them for the chief Power in <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf, and oft overtopt them, till they got Foreign Princes to help them. To this day they claim not Imperial Power over other Princes, ſave indirectly, as nullifying the Title of the Excommunicate, falſely pretending that they may excommunicate them, and that Chriſtians may then reject them as no Kings. Is all this an Univerſal Empire, and was <hi>Rome</hi> the Whore for 700 years, or not? It is ſuppoſed that <hi>Idolatry</hi> and <hi>Perſecution</hi> make her the <hi>Whore,</hi> and her Civil Power, the Beaſt. Tranſubſtantiation is the groſſeſt part of the firſt, and that is a Novelty? A few odd men wrote for it a little ſooner, but their Church owned it not by Law, till the fourth <hi>Lateran</hi> Council under <hi>Inno.</hi> the 3. almoſt twelve hundred years after Chriſt. And exceſs of Veneration to Saints and Angels, moſt Churches on Earth owned and ſtill own, (the <hi>Greek, Armenian, Abaſſine,</hi> &amp;c.)

Some ſay <hi>Rome</hi> was the Whore ever ſince 300: And ſo all, or near all, the Church of Chriſt in the Empire was the Beaſt, or Whore, or both: (except the few poor men in <hi>Piedmont</hi> and <hi>Languedock,</hi> for I am of the opinion, that they kept their Simplicity and Integrity ever ſince <hi>Diocleſians</hi> Perſecution,) and then all the Glory of the b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>y, turned to our confuſion. (I have fully in my Hiſtory of Councils de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed the miſchiefs of Clergy-Ambition, but never thought that ſuch mens faults ſo overthrew all Chriſts Church in the Empire, as to make it Antichriſtian: A Holy Humble Miniſtry upheld it, while ſome ambitious carnal Prelates troubled it,) As even a Heathen <hi>Am. Marcellinus</hi> witneſſeth, ſpeaking of <hi>Damaſus</hi>'s, caſe. If Chriſt had no Church viſible ſo many hundred years, then he was no Chriſt, or King, of a viſible Church, which is a ſad concluſion for oppoſers of Antichriſt. Doth he ſay worſe againſt Chriſt himſelf?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Others ſay that <hi>Rome</hi> began to be <hi>Babylon.</hi> the 606, under <hi>Boniface.</hi> the 3. and <hi>Phocas,</hi> (on the grounds before confuted) 3. Others begin it under <hi>Boniface</hi> the Eighth. 4. Others begin it with <hi>Hildebrands</hi> Uſurpation over Princes, between 1000. and 1100 years after Chriſt. 5. Others begin it with <hi>Innocent</hi> the third, who in the <hi>Lateran</hi> Council generally firſt owned that Uſurpation and Tranſubſtantiation, and Bloody Perſecution for it, which before were owned but by lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle factious Parties. 6. Others labour to prove that that Council made no Decrees, and ſo that it was not ſetled then.</p>
            <p>Now, if <hi>Rome</hi> for 606 years, or for 1000, or for 1100 years was not <hi>Babylon,</hi> then Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan <hi>Rome</hi> was not then, nor Chriſtian <hi>Rome</hi>; and no man knoweth when it began to be ſo: And then almoſt all our moſt confident late Expoſitions are quite overthrown. But doubtleſs <hi>John</hi> was told of a <hi>Babylon,</hi> a Whore, a Beaſt, which was much ealier than this. The ſix or ſeven <hi>ſpecies</hi> of Pagan Government, were not the Heads of a Chriſtian Papal Beaſt, that was to riſe 1000, or 600 years after Chriſt.

            <p>With theſe Reaſons, this ſort of Expoſitors add the anſwer to the contrary objections. And to the firſt they ſay, that the <hi>Riſing of the Beaſt out of the Sea,</hi> doth but tell the order of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to <hi>John,</hi> and not that the Beaſt was not yet in being; and it may mean <hi>Domitian</hi> or <hi>Diocle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian,</hi> not yet come.

               </gap> theſe ſatisfie not the Cenſurers Zeal him, that is ignorant, be ignorant, and he that is wrathful, be ſo ſtill.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. I do judge of Popery by the knowledge of its particular Errours and Sins, and not by the Revelations, or any thing which I underſtand not. If the Pope be the great Antichriſt, which I neither deny, nor affirm, becauſe I know not, (as I have long ago confeſſed,) I think that it is formally, as he is by claim the <hi>Vice-Chriſt, Vicarius Chriſti,</hi> and claimeth an <hi>Univerſal Soveraignty Eccleſiaſtical over the whole Church on Earth,</hi> (and not over a Nation only;) and that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan with that claim, to which his many corruptions are joyned to make up a body of iniquity: Were there no more to be ſaid againſt that Church, than, 1. This claim of <hi>Univerſal Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:66325:304"/>
2. And the cheriſhing of <hi>Ignorance,</hi> by forbidding the reading of the Scripture in a known Tongue, without Licence, and <hi>Latine</hi> Prayers and Service, and an Ignorant Clergy. 3. And the Inhumane Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation. 4. And the vile corruptions of much of God's Worſhip. 5. And their horrid Blood-guiltineſs, by which they do uphold their Kingdom cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Church. I take thoſe Popes and Papiſts, who own all this, to be liable, before God, to greater puniſhment, than the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> and <hi>falſe Prophet,</hi> mentioned in the <hi>Revelations</hi>; it being far worſe to ſin thus under the name of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt's Vicar,</hi> and <hi>holy Biſhops,</hi> than as <hi>Infidels</hi> and <hi>Heathens,</hi> to whom (as to <hi>Sodom</hi>) it ſhall be eaſier in the day of Judgment than for theſe.</p>
            <p n="5">V. Therefore I judge, that a Confederacy or Coalition with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in any of theſe ſins, or in the very <hi>form</hi> of a <hi>Church headed by a pretended Univerſal Head</hi> or <hi>Soveraign,</hi> is to be abhorred by all ſound Chriſtians: And I am glad that this Kingdom is ſworn againſt all <hi>Foreign Juriſdiction, Civil</hi> or <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi>; though Union and Concord with all Foreign Churches muſt be as far kept as we are able, not partaking of their ſins. But I have long ag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> (in my <hi>Key for Catholicks</hi>) propoſed the deſirable terms (not for a Coalition, but) for neighbourly Peace, that we may live in love and quietneſs, and not as thoſe that ſtill take themſelves bound to deſtroy each other.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. On theſe grounds I judge of <hi>Perſons</hi> according to their <hi>Perſonal Guilt,</hi> and not by the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral name of <hi>Papiſts.</hi> I abhor thoſe that are wicked, and that own the foreſaid wickedneſs, but not all that are called Roman Catholicks, that live in the fear of God, and in Charity. I will try uncertainties by certainties, and not deny Fundamentals in oppoſition to mens By-Opinions. I am certain that I muſt love a Chriſtian, as ſuch, and that as much as in me lieth I muſt live peaceably with all men, and avoid all unneceſſary Diviſion, Wrath and Hatred; and I am ſure that, <hi>Bleſſed are the Peace-makers,</hi> for (whatever Errour calleth them) they ſhall be called the Children of God: I am ſure, that I muſt (unneceſſarily) ſpeak evil of no man; and that ſlander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and falſe-accuſing are diabolical works; and that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he Wiſdom is from beneath, which cauſeth Envy and Strife; and, in a word, that LOVE is Chriſt's <hi>Work</hi> and Character, and <hi>Hatred</hi> the Devils: But I am not ſure that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath theſe 1000 or 1300 years been the <hi>Whore,</hi> and <hi>Babylon,</hi> meant in theſe Texts; nor that yet all Papiſts ſhall be tormented, as worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Beaſt, or his Image, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am ſure, that the Viſible Church will have ſcandals, and ambitious men; and yet that its deliverance in <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s time, and the following Ages, was a wondrous mercy, which Heaven and Earth did rejoyce in, and praiſe God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>or: And it was a great part of Chriſt's coming to Reign by Chriſtian Princes, and that the Kingdoms of the World were made the Kingdoms of Chriſt: Therefore I dread the denying Chriſt theſe Kingdoms, and reproaching even the beſt Ages of his Church on Earth as Antichriſtian, leſt I deny him to have any Church Viſible at all, or tempt men to Infidelity, by ſaying that Chriſt is ſo little a King, and came to ſo little a work in the World, as to have no Church, ſave the perſecuted part, till <hi>An.</hi> 300, and the Reformers ſince 1560, ſave a few latent perſons. Men will judge of the Workman by his work, and of Phyſicians by their Cures: And though it be honourable to ſave one Soul, they will tempt men to diſhonour Chriſt, that call almoſt all his Church Antichriſtian. I would not ſlander one man, but ſhould I miſtake, and ſlander millions for thirteen hundred years together, how great were my guilt!</p>
            <p n="7">VII. I dread the turning Religion into a humane, hurtful, love-killing Faction. If I abhor millions and millions meerly on my uncertain expoſition of the <hi>Revelations,</hi> I cannot do it in Faith. If one ask me why I do it, and I ſay, becauſe they are of <hi>Babylon,</hi> or worſhip the Beaſt, and you ask me, how I know it, I muſt ſay that I know it not; But moſt here believe it becauſe Mr. <hi>A.</hi> Mr. <hi>B.</hi> Mr. <hi>C. &amp;c.</hi> ſay ſo: And ſo as Papiſts found their <hi>Faith,</hi> and their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of us as hereticks, on the credit of their Teachers, that ſay ſo, ſo ſhall we ours on the word of our Teachers. And here I dread the effects, <hi>viz,</hi> abhorring men cauſeleſly, corrupting our Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Sermons and Books, and fathering all on God, condemning all as favouring Popery, who
<pb facs="tcp:66325:305"/>
have not contracted this hating diſeaſe; crying down many good and many harmleſs things, merely becauſe they come from the beaſt and <hi>Babylon.</hi> Temples themſelves, good Prayers, excellent Miniſters and Churches, yea Baptiſm it ſelf, have been cryed down and renounced, as <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> and Antichriſtian, and a ground of endleſs Diviſions, and ſtarting at every ſhaddow that <hi>Rome</hi> hath had to do with, is thus laid; yea the Seekers greatly countenanced that ſay, Scripture, Church and Miniſtry, are loſt in the wilderneſs, and the Church feigned to be brought into the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, juſt when it was brought out of it, (which was the <hi>Pagan</hi> perſecution;) even the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Churches are condemned as being yet Antichriſtian; And the Martyrs, that ſuffered by Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, yea and thoſe that ſuffered in the 3d 4th and 5th Centuries by <hi>Arrians</hi> and others, are all made by many to be the Children of <hi>Babylon</hi>; And a war proclaimed between profeſſed Chriſtians, by which all the Romaniſts are tempted to hate and deſtroy us, as thoſe that would do ſo by them. And all this by the expounding the <hi>Revelations</hi> of that, which no man, that hath not more know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge than I, can find that it ſaith, or medleth with: And that needleſly, while we have plain texts enough that condemn Popery, and all ſin, by which we may abhor bad men, without the danger of hating the Children of God. Chriſt is in our <hi>Creed,</hi> but Antichriſt is not. All the old Fathers were not Papiſts that took not the Pope for Antichriſt: But more probability of it may be gathered from other Texts than from the <hi>Revelations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">VIII. To ſay, <hi>I know not</hi> what I would know and cannot, is eaſier to me, than the dread of being guilty of the ſin threatned in the concluſion of this Book, that God will add the plagues in it to them that add to it, and blot his name out of the Book of Life, who taketh from it. (I deny not other mens knowledge, but my own: Ignorance of mens ignorance is the mortal diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe of the world:) To add to the <hi>ſenſe</hi> is to add to the Book: To ſay, <hi>this is the ſenſe,</hi> when I know it not, and where five of the wiſeſt are of four minds (and Common Chriſtians take all on truſt) this expoſeth me to the dread of this heavy curſe:</p>
            <p>If this account excuſe me not to the Reader, it excuſeth me to my Conſcience, whoſe cenſure I muſt more fear than mans, leſt I prefer my intereſt in the good opinion of partial miſled cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorious dividers, before the pleaſing of God, and my Salvation, and that when I am going from this World to him: And if all this ſeem too much to any, the diſeaſes and danger of the Churches, the extreams of many and their ſad effects, theſe fifty years, and the confuting of thoſe who falſly interpret my Hiſtory of Biſhops and Councils, do make it ſeem otherwiſe to me.</p>
            <p>I blame not modeſt conjectures, if men will but confeſs their uncertainty, when they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, and not make an uncertain Opinion an Article of Faith, and ſacrifice to it certain Fundamental Truth or Duty, the Churches Peace or Chriſtian Love, nor uſe it to kindle a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, hating, dividing Zeal. Good Mr. <hi>Brightman</hi> did with a Pious Mind, determine many things very confidently, which time hath already confuted: He hath concluded that the Bleſſed Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and time of Chriſts Thouſand years Reign in the New <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſhall be 1695, ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven years hence. <hi>Thomas Rogers,</hi> and many others, have been ſhamed by ſetting times, which being paſt have confuted them. This hath frighten'd ſome others from that boldneſs, who yet in other uncertainties have been ſo confident, as that they have drawn many good People there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to meaſure their Faith and Charity. I am far from thinking, that deeper Students are as igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant herein as I: But I would not have all that are as ignorant, lookt upon as Aliens. And I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that I am leſs able to expound Prophecies than <hi>Daniel,</hi> who yet thus concludeth, <hi>Ch.</hi> 12.8, 9. <hi>And I heard, but I underſtood not: Then ſaid I, O my Lord, what ſhall be the end of theſe things? And he ſaid, Go thy way,</hi> Daniel, <hi>for the Words are cloſed up and ſealed, till the time of the end.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet I ſay as <hi>Calvin,</hi> [<hi>I make no doubt, but the Revelation is Gods Word, though I underſtand it not</hi>;] and that it is not uſeleſs: Yea ſo much as I do underſtand, is of exceeding comfortable uſe: Though I know not whether the New <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> will come down from Heaven before, or at, the Common Reſurrection, it rejoiceth me that it will come: And God having condeſcended
<pb facs="tcp:66325:305"/>
to deſcribe it, as Glorious, by corporeal Similitudes, to us that have no full Idea's of things Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, it is a meet means of our comfort, by ſuch Similitudes, to conceive of that Glory; and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to imprint them on our minds, to further our deſires of that Bleſſed State, and make <hi>us Loves</hi> and long for Chriſts appearing, and cry daily, <hi>Come Lord Jeſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While I was writing this, there came to my hands, <hi>Iſaac Voſſius</hi> his <hi>Var. Obſervat.</hi> In which he ſheweth the magnitude of <hi>Rome,</hi> when it was in its Grandeur, (it being about 60 Miles about) and how it decreaſed, and that <hi>Conſtantine</hi> deſtroyed <hi>Rome</hi> far more, and before the <hi>Goths,</hi> by building <hi>Conſtantinople</hi>; ſo that within 80 years it was not the fifth part ſo big, as in <hi>Aurelians</hi> time: And that when <hi>Rufus</hi> and <hi>Victor</hi> wrote, there remained not the 20th part of the old City; and that now, under the Pope, it is ſo far from containing the ſeven Hills, that it is almoſt all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the <hi>Campus Martius,</hi> and containeth not now ſcarce the two hundredth part of the old City. And that it was fitly called <hi>Babylon</hi> the great, we read that old <hi>Babylon</hi> was near as great as <hi>Rome</hi> at the greateſt, and by <hi>Herodotus,</hi> and ſome others made greater.</p>
            <p>It is anſwered to this, that <hi>it is the ſame City ſtill, known by the ſame Name.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it hath not either the ſame <hi>Situation,</hi> Magnitude, Power, Dominion, and Idolatrous Fornication, by which <hi>John</hi> was to know it, nor would that deſcription agree to it now. By many ſuch reaſons I ſuſpect that the Queſtions, (<hi>who is the Beaſt? which is</hi> Babylon? <hi>and who is the</hi> Antichriſt?) are not the ſame in the Scripture ſenſe, nor muſt have the ſame Solution.</p>
            <p>If any, that are Friends to Papal Uſurpation, and Church-Corruption; ſhall think that my confeſſed ignorance of theſe Prophecies, is any advantage to their ill Cauſe, I will further tell them, that it is far more dreadful to the Pope, and all his Flatterers, and Followers, to be plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly condemned by the known Laws of Chriſt, which all Chriſtians receive as paſt all doubt, than to be under the Dread of a dark and controverted Prophecie. To them that ſay, the Pope is the firſt and ſecond Beaſt, the Whore of <hi>Babylon,</hi> the Man of ſin, the falſe Chriſt or Antichriſt, you have the ſhift of a contempt of his words, as of a controverted uncertain thing; but who knoweth not, that the plain Law of God concludeth, that the Proud, the Worldly, the Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, the Idolatrous, Murderers, Perſecutors, Liars, the Enemies of Chriſts Goſpel and ſerious Godlineſs, are Satans Slaves, and ſhall not enter into the Kingdom of God? Can any man, that readeth but what <hi>Baronius, Binnius, Genebrard,</hi> and the moſt flattering of your Hiſtorians, ſay of the Popes from <hi>An.</hi> 700, till 1400, think that God owned and guided ſo wicked a ſort of Men? I again tell thoſe, that are angry at my Hiſtory of Biſhops and Councils, that I doubt not but God had, in all ages, a viſible Church of Pious Chriſtians, kept up by the lower ſort of Biſhops and Paſtors, and ſome of the higher (Patriarcks and Metropolitans,) but it was by theſe Majorites, and Ambitious Men, that corruption, cruelty and diſſention, chiefly entered; and they being uppermoſt, a few of them, by noiſe, oſtentation and domineering, paſt for the whole Church with undiſcerning Men.</p>
            <p>And here to ſhew you how the Pope hath ſucceeded the moſt bloody Pagan Perſecutors, and outdone them, I will inſtance in a Hiſtory not ſufficiently underſtood by moſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Diocleſian</hi> murthered more Chriſtians than all the former Pagan Perſecutors ſet together: Among others he dealt ſo cruelly and inhumanely with them in <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Savoy,</hi> and <hi>Retia,</hi> as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced many to ſtand upon their defence to ſave their Lives; two Commanders, <hi>Amandus</hi> and <hi>Elianus</hi> headed them, and raiſed them, that were but Country Club-men, into Arms: Much of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> favoured them. <hi>Diocleſian</hi> made <hi>Herculius Maximianus Ceſar,</hi> and ſent him with an Army againſt them. In this Army was the <hi>Theban</hi> Legion, whoſe Colonel was <hi>Mauritius</hi>; at the <hi>Alpes Herculius</hi> would try his Souldiers, by Idolatrous Tricks, whether they would fight againſt theſe Chriſtians called Rebels, or not: The <hi>Theban</hi> Legion ſaid they could fight againſt bad Men, but not againſt good Men, but would rather ſubmit their lives to his pleaſure; (not being able to reſiſt if they would:) So he decimated them, and killed 70, and with the reſt of his Army quickly routed the Country-Clubmen, and beſieged their very ſtrong Caſtle, and killed them all, and overthrew their Fortreſs. Many ſcore thouſand are ſaid to be killed, and the
<pb facs="tcp:66325:306"/>
name <hi>Bagaudae</hi> put on them in ſcorn, (like <hi>Tories</hi> and <hi>Whigs,</hi>) as ſignifying Thieves and Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</p>
            <p>And what's all this to the <hi>Roman</hi> Pope? <hi>Anſ.</hi> Theſe were the Chriſtians murthered by <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſians</hi> and <hi>Herculius, Pagans</hi>; the Relicks of the Fugitives continued in <hi>Languedock, Piedmont, Rhetia,</hi> &amp;c. from age to age, till at laſt reviving to a more free oppoſition to Popiſh Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and Corruption, they were murthered by the Popes,) (by <hi>Simon Montford,</hi> and his <hi>Cruſado</hi>'s, and others after<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) to a far greater number than by <hi>Herculius Max.</hi> So that ſome Hiſtorians, rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon two Milions killed in all, in thoſe and other parts. And is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it not more wicked for a profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Vicar of Chriſt, to murther Millions of poor Chriſtians, for being againſt his Tyranny and Corruptions, than for a Pagan Emperour, that had Civil Dominion, to kill not half ſo many?</p>
            <p>I know it will be doubted by ſome, 1. Whether theſe <hi>Bagaudae</hi> were Chriſtians, ſeeing it is ſaid that they never reſiſted their Perſecuting Princes, but uſed only Prayers and Tears? And 2. Whether the <hi>Albigenſes</hi> and <hi>Waldenſes</hi> were their Succeſſors? The Hiſtory is of great Weight. I prove both parts.</p>

<q>[<hi>Oroſius</hi> the Hiſtory-writer in his Hiſtory which he compoſed — affirmeth that the foreſaid Caſtle was by <hi>Maximianus Herculius</hi> overthrown to the very ground, and utterly deſtroyed; becauſe <hi>Amandus</hi> &amp; <hi>Elianus, (Chriſtianae Cultores Fidei,)</hi> who were of the Chriſtian Religion, would not be ſubject to the Sacrilegious <hi>Roman</hi> Princes: For the ſame <hi>Maximianus,</hi> having gathered an Army of <hi>Romans,</hi> and joyning to him the Legion of the <hi>Theban</hi> Soldiours, drew towards them, that he might utterly deſtroy the Caſtle of the <hi>Bagauds</hi>; And paſſing over the <hi>Alpes</hi> with his Army, and reſting weary about <hi>Octodurum,</hi> commanded to invite all to the <hi>Fanatick</hi> Sacrifices, and to take an oath upon the Sacreds of the Gods, that they would with one mind fight againſt the troops (or companies) of the <hi>Bagauds</hi>: And the reſt of the Chriſtians whereover found, he decreed ſhould be kill'd by all men. But when this came to the ears of <hi>Maurice,</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the <hi>Theban</hi> Legion, <hi>viz,</hi> that <hi>Ceſar</hi> commanded them to fight againſt Chriſtians, he ſaid to him (the Emperour,) we know how to fight againſt Impious men, but to deſtroy godly men and Fellow Citizens, we are utterly ignorant; We hold our Arms you ſee, but we reſiſt not, for we are readier to die than to kill: And ſo they joy fully yielded their necks to the Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners, and, by the Torment of their Bodies, paſt to the heavenly glory. Then <hi>Ceſar</hi> proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and coming to the Caſtle of the <hi>Bagauds,</hi> ſo long beſieged it by Land and Water, till after a long time he took it, with the poſſeſſors, whom he kill'd with Sword and Fire: And ſo brought to nought the Caſtle that, beſides the ruins of the ditches, no ſigns appeared of any Fortifications. As among other Caſtles it was tumid with Munition, more excellent than the Imperial, ſo by the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperour it was brought lower by deſtruction. And the Inhabitants of the ſaid Caſtle, who (as I before noted) were Chirſtians, deſpiſing the care of their Body for the Love of God, are to be believed to have paſſed to the heavenly Kingdom by Martyrdom, ſo far this Author.</q>

            </q>
            <p>I conclude with <hi>Martinius</hi> his words hereon,
<q>[<hi>Et talis eſt mos,</hi> &amp;c.] Such is the manner of ſome, who being titled (or called) <hi>Clement,</hi> delight to be <hi>Inclement</hi>: The end of whoſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation and Government, is as was their predeceſſor <hi>Rehobaam.</hi> Ambition and Luxury do this, ſo great weight is in that one Rule [MODERATE THINGS ARE DURABLE,] and the Prudence, in Publick and Family Government to proportion our Expences to our Eſtates, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But it will not be better with human affairs, as long as the Wiſdom from above is excluded, and the Wiſdom that is earthly, ſenſual and deviliſh, taketh place in the World. But yet let not the ſuffering of any evil, draw us to do any evil: For it is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt evil, not to be able to bear evil.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Out of all this, it is evident. 1. That the horrid oppreſſion and cruelty againſt Chriſtians in <hi>Diocleſians</hi> time did drive theſe Chriſtians, in <hi>France,</hi> to a ruſtick ſelf-defence, under the conduct of <hi>Amandus</hi> and <hi>Elianus.</hi> 2. That it was for refuſing to fight againſt them, that the <hi>Theban</hi> Legion was decimated, (and 70 killed ſay ſome,) and with all for not ſwearing and ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing to the Gods. 3. That it was the great numbers of Chriſtians, (whoſe multiplication <hi>Euſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi> deſcribeth in <hi>Diocleſians</hi> daies,) that cauſed him to deſtroy them, leſt they ſhould grow too ſtrong for him (as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> did by the <hi>Iſraelites.</hi>) 4. That yet theſe ſelf-defending Chriſtians ſped worſe, and ſuffered more, than they had done if they had fled. 5. That thoſe that the <hi>Pagan</hi> Emperour called Rebells, and Seditious Rogues, ſuch writers as the Author of the Life of that <hi>Babolen</hi> doubt not to number with glorified Martyrs: How well let them anſwer.</p>
            <p n="2">II. But what is all this to the Popes of <hi>Rome? Anſ.</hi> It ſeemeth clearly to be the Succeſſours of theſe, that the Popes after murthered. For, 1. There is no doubt but though many that took

Arms were kill'd, and their Caſtle demoliſhed, the far greateſt part were not in Arm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, and therefore ſaved themſelves by flight, and hiding, ſpecially Old Men and Women, and Children. 2. No doubt but they fled to the moſt Mountanous and deſerted parts, as ſafeſt. 3. No Hiſtory tells us of their flying ſo far as the Aged, and Women, and Weak could not go, but to <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guedock, Piedmont, Rhetia,</hi> and about the <hi>Alpes.</hi> 4. The People murthered by the Popes, were found moſt in thoſe ſame Countreys, and are of the very like deſcription. That there were ſome <hi>Manichees</hi> among them, who diſgraced the reſt, and made <hi>Bernard, Peter Cluniacenſis,</hi> and <hi>Walafr. Strab.</hi> and others accuſe them hardly, it is no wonder: The Apoſtles Churches had Hereſies, <hi>Luthers</hi> Reformation was accompanied with many diſgraceful Sects; nor is it marvel that we read of no great noiſe againſt or about them, for ſome hundred years after <hi>Diocleſian,</hi> and that they were not called <hi>Albigenſes, Waldenſes,</hi> &amp;c. till of late. For it was many hundred years after, before the Biſhops turned to perſecute their Fellow-Chriſtians openly: And when they did, theſe were poor people and harmleſs, fled (as the <hi>Britains</hi> into <hi>Wales,</hi>) where they were niether a deſireable prey, nor any great annoyance to any: And when ſome Teachers after more openly cryed down the Popes Tyranny and Corruptions, then they began to be more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famed and perſecuted. 5. <hi>Reynerius,</hi> that well knew them, teſtifyeth that they were more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous than new riſen Sects, becauſe they boaſted of their Antiquity, that they were called <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolicks,</hi> and had continued what they then were from the days of <hi>Silveſter</hi>: And <hi>Silveſter</hi> liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Conſtantines</hi> time, and was Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> about <hi>An.</hi> 314, and ſo lived in <hi>Diocleſians</hi> time; ſo that either theſe <hi>Albigenſes</hi> were the Succeſſours of the murdered <hi>Bagauds</hi> or another ſort juſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> like them in the ſame Country, which no reaſon can imagine. Of their Antiquity ſee more in <hi>Paul Perin,</hi> and <hi>Morlands</hi> Hiſtory of them, but eſpecially at large in Biſhop <hi>Uſher de Succeſſione Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiarum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I think then it is manifeſt by this Hiſtory that the bloody Popes and Papiſts, did murder the ſame ſort of Men, (yea three or four times more in number,) by Sword and Inquiſition (not only there but in <hi>Germany, Bohemia, Poland,</hi> &amp;c. whither they were diſperſt,) which <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſian</hi> and <hi>Max. Herculius</hi> murthered; (and yet honour St. <hi>Maurice,</hi> and the <hi>Theban</hi> Legion, that would not fight againſt them, as they do St. <hi>Martin,</hi> that ſeparated from the Biſhops that were but for killing a <hi>Gnoſtick Priſcilianiſt:</hi>) And it is not the Name of a Heretick, that will Cloak ſuch hypocritical Cruelty, or deceive Chriſt, that he ſhall not know his Flock, it men miſcall them. To own Chriſt and the Goſpel, and to murder Thouſands, or Millions in his Name, as if he took it for acceptable Service, is incomparably a more aggravated crime, than the moſt bloody Pagan Perſecution was.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:66325:307"/>
               <hi>Obj. But how then can you hold that the whole Viſible Church was never the Seat, or Society of Antichriſt, in any one age</hi>?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Very well: Chriſt was Chriſt, the head of his Church, <hi>as viſible and inviſible,</hi> in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry age, 1. Three or four parts of the Chriſtian World were then, and are now, from under the Pope: this very bloody Council ſaith, <hi>c.</hi> 4.
<q>That the Greeks rejected the Roman Pope, and ſo far abhorred the Latines, that if Latine Prieſts did but celebrate at their Altars, their Greeks judged them defiled, and would not uſe them again, till they had waſhed them, yea they rebaptized thoſe whom the Latine Prieſts baptized.</q>
And they once a year Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated the Popes long, and they owned not <hi>Tranſubſtantiation:</hi> And they, with the <hi>Abaſſines, Armenians,</hi> and all ſuch others, were three or four times more than the Papiſts.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And who may not eaſily know that a Pope, and ſuch a Council called General, are not the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Viſible Church, real or repreſentative? Its not unlike that forty to one might be againſt them. King <hi>John</hi>'s Embaſſador was one of the conſenters, who then was in conteſt againſt <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen Langton,</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and to conquer his own Lords and Kingdom, gave his Kingdom to the Pope, and took it as from him. And if ſuch a King had the choice of Biſhops, they would no more repreſent the Church there, than he and his Court repreſented the Kingdom, when he gave it away, and fought againſt it; and thoſe Biſhops that the Pope choſe did as little repreſent it, being more the Meſſengers of his will, than of the Churches: And how few Biſhops were in ſuch Councils, beſides thoſe that the Pope made or conſented to? When he, and the Emperours <hi>Henry</hi>'s were in War, the Emperors Biſhops condemned the Popes, and the Popes Biſhops condemned the Emperors, and theſe Servants of two Men in power, were not the repreſenters of the Church. The multitude of lower quiet Biſhops, Paſtors and People were the Viſible Chu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ch, more than <hi>England</hi> was a Viſible Kingdom, diſtinct from King <hi>John</hi>'s Court; for the Pope was but an Uſurping head, which that King then was not.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj. Then you make two Viſible Churches in</hi> Europe. <hi>Anſ.</hi> Yes; Chriſt had one diffuſed over the World; and the Pope made another, by Uſurpation and Rebellion, which was <hi>Regnum in Regno,</hi> as any Rebel might do that could get ſtrength, to ſet up a party in power, to call him King, in ſome part of a Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Such an Antichriſtianity as this, I make no doubt but the Papacy did become guilty of; and none that owneth it as ſuch, and receiveth their mark, can be Innocent; but are condemned by plainer Evidence than dark Prophecies; but I will not therefore ſay the ſame, of all, from <hi>An.</hi> 304. (Or any other,) that lived before this contracted guilt, though too many at <hi>Rome,</hi> and other Countreys, prepared the way; nor yet of all called Papiſts, who own not the crimes, and Characters of ſuch men; and much leſs of all the Viſible Church in any one age: And leaſt of all of all the Viſible Church, ſince 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>In this Judgement I am (in Pain and Languiſhing) waiting for my Change, and Hope of a World, where all is expounded, and all Wickedneſs, Malignity, and Diviſions ſhut out, and Holineſs, Love and Concord perfected, and all perfectly pleaſed in pleaſing God.</p>

But if you are never ſo ſure that it is he indeed, pull him not down by calling Truth, Duty or things lawful, Antichriſtian, nor by telling men that all Proteſtants are Idolaters or Antichriſtian, if they forſake not the Communion of all our Parochial Proteſtant Churches, and of all other Reformed Churches that are as bad as they, that the Papiſts may re-enter into them as deſerted
<pb facs="tcp:66325:308"/>
Garriſons, and find no reſiſtance: Nor by telling the World that all our Laws againſt Popiſh Recuſancy do puniſh them, for not doing an unlawful thing, which all Proteſtants ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe as well as they. This is no likelier a way to pull down Antichriſt, than Racking and Tearing the Reformed Churches, by unlawful Snares, and ſilencing the Faithfuleſt Miniſters of Chriſt. But above all, begin not the Papal Antichriſtianity, with the beginning of the Chriſtians delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance by <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> nor too ſoon; nor feign it to be Univerſal: Read ſuch Books, as <hi>Jewel, Rivet, Blondel, Pet.

If you are Schollars, which prove the Novelty of Popery, and the confident offer of the preſent Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> Dr. <hi>Barlow,</hi> (no ſtranger to Antiquity, or Books,) that he will recant and turn to them.</p>

               <p>Let them prove by any full and concluding reaſon, that any Chriſtian Church in the World acknowledged, or the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> her ſelf aſſumed, and publickly pleaded for, ſuch a Papal Supremacy as now they pretend to, for 1000 years, after our Bleſſed Saviour, and for my own part, I will confeſs, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract my error.</p>
