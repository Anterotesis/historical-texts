            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>I being a person who (without vanity) may say,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:106993:3"/>
that Heaven hath blessed with so much of a Publick Spirit, that I feel in my heart an inclination that would do good unto all men; but since my ability quadrats not with my desires, (that being GODS peculiar Priviledge, whose Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotencie can onely equall his Will,) I must rest satisfied with the extent of my Cordiall Good Wishes for the Wellfare of all: from which Principle, (though I am not in a capacity to act,) I could not forbear to express some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things in these <hi>Memorialls,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by I humbly conceive, the Good and Wellfare of the <hi>Burrows</hi> of this <hi>Kingdom</hi> may in some measure be advanced, if acceptably im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proven.</p>
                  <p>It would be from a defect of <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi>
                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:106993:3"/>
if any apprehend I have wrot these out of conceit of my own abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, for I am not so fond of any Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent I have acquyred, that if my ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestness to cast in my Mite into the Treasurie for the Publick Good, had not overballanced the mean thoughts I have of any thing I can do of this nature, I should never have dared to present you with them. But now here they be, and such as they are I presume to lay before You, who are the <hi>Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives</hi> of the Chiefest <hi>City</hi> of this <hi>Nation.</hi> It is your Discretion, your Zeall for the Publick-Good, your Christian Wisdom and Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, your Righteousness and Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that influences not only the rest of the <hi>Burrows,</hi> but also most of the Subjects of this <hi>Kingdom.</hi> I am

not ignorant how much I expose my self to the Critick Censures of many, in permitting the Publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this <hi>Tractat,</hi> considering the Politness and Learning of this Age, and my own Imperfections in undertaking such a Task: Yet if ye shall be pleased favourably to accept hereof, Charitably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structing my Zeal, and covering my Defects and Over-reachings, I need care the less what thoughts others have of me or it. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is frequent with many, to measure their Esteem of Books by the respect or disrespect that is had to the Author, I have therefore suppressed my Name, that it may neither be undervalued, or pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly by some overvalued upon my account: but that all may be left

to consider what is said, then to enquyre who said so.

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>states and Ranks of Persons, is to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, to any of the three sorts of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that hath been; or at this day is in use in <hi>Kingdoms Common-Wealths</hi> or <hi>Cities</hi> as they are simply considered; as <hi>Democracie</hi>: which is, when the People, or mixed Multitude, have the Supream Power in them, <hi>Magistrats</hi> are chosen by them, <hi>Laws</hi> are made by them, and that which is carried by the greater part, is esteemed to be the Judgement of the whole:
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:106993:11"/>
Their great end is Liberty to live as they please, and do what they think fit; and this kind of Government degenerats often into confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and many gross abuses have been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly, Aristocracie,</hi> which is, when a few persons have the Soveraign Power in them, and this often degenerats into <hi>Faction</hi> and <hi>Division.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Simple <hi>Monarchie,</hi> when one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son hath absolutely the whole Power in himself to make what Laws he will, and do whatsoever he thinks good, and this often degenerats into <hi>Tyrannie.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But as is said, a well mixed Government, made up wisely of all Estates and Ranks of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, is preferred before any of these. Such is the Government of this our <hi>Ancient Kingdom,</hi> and in some respect, our <hi>Cities</hi> are mostly so constitute; for since a <hi>Common-Wealth</hi> or <hi>Citie,</hi> consists of severall Degrees of men of different conditions and imployments, some <hi>Merchants</hi> some considerable <hi>Heritors</hi> that live upon their Rents, some <hi>Tradsmen</hi> and <hi>Handicrafts,</hi> the want of which, would make a great defect in a <hi>Common-Wealth,</hi> all the Members are usefull, and make but one Body, that as 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.21, 22. <hi>The Eye cannot say to the Hand I have no need of thee: nor again, the Head to the Feet I have no need of you: nay much more these Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Body, which seem to be more feeble are
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:106993:11"/>
necessary.</hi> It cannot then but agree with reason, that every estate and condition of men, should have their own share in the manadgement of these things, according to their proportions and interests in the whole.</p>
                     <p>We have matter to bless GOD, for the equal and just constitution of Government not onely of the whole kingdom (which of it self is as good as any in the World,) but also for that well tempered mixture, granted to us by our KINGS, &amp; left unto us of our <hi>Worthy Ances<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours,</hi> which is in our <hi>Cities,</hi> and more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar <hi>Common-Wealths,</hi> being thus.</p>
                     <p>Our <hi>Town-Councills</hi> is chosen out of the whole <hi>Citizens</hi> and <hi>Burgesses</hi> of the <hi>Burgh,</hi> the <hi>Citie-Roll</hi> being read at every Election of <hi>Councill,</hi> that if <hi>Aristotle</hi> were alive, he would not cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure us as he did the Government and Lawes of the <hi>Gretians,</hi> given by <hi>Minos</hi> and <hi>Rada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manthus</hi>: for their <hi>Cosmi</hi> or <hi>Magistrats</hi> were not chosen out of all the People, but out of some few of every <hi>Tribe</hi>; though they did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that all their Laws were made by <hi>Jupiters</hi> advyce: and for this, the most of the <hi>Grecian Re-publicks</hi> did imitate them, particularly <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curgus</hi> the <hi>Lacedemonian,</hi> there being a large List drawn up of all amongst us, where is set down every one whom any person of the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Council</hi> desires or nominats: then they choose the prefixed number, that are appointed to be
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:106993:12"/>
                        <hi>New Counsellours</hi> for the ensuing Year: Next they choose out of their own number, who have been ruling the Year preceeding, so many as are by the Law appointed to continue, <hi>Ja.</hi> 3. <hi>P.</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi> 57. And lastly, so many of the <hi>Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons</hi> of the <hi>Trades,</hi> as should compleat the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the <hi>Councill,</hi> all which being presently called and conveened, they with the <hi>Old Councill,</hi> and the whole <hi>Deacons</hi> of the <hi>Trades,</hi> (besides these <hi>Tradsmen</hi> that are on the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Councill</hi>) do elect of these that are chosen for <hi>Counsellours</hi> for the Year to come, <hi>Provest, Bailies,</hi> and all other <hi>Office-bearers</hi> requisite. Thus <hi>Bretheren of Gild,</hi> and <hi>Tradsmen,</hi> of which our <hi>Cities</hi> consists, have all their equall share in the Government of our <hi>Royal-Burrows.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When any matter of more then ordinary Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance comes to be consulted of, if the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cill</hi> find it meet, they call the former years <hi>Council,</hi> and joyns both in the Consultation and Determination and if it be a business of setting on of a <hi>Tax,</hi> or <hi>Levying of Money</hi>; whether for <hi>Nationall,</hi> or <hi>Particular Use,</hi> or such like, the consent of the whole is called for in a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick <hi>Head-Court</hi> conveened by Authority of the <hi>Magistrats</hi>: for the Reasons of the said <hi>Tax,</hi> or <hi>Imposition</hi> is holden out to them, so that by this, it may be evident to the judicious, that we have the best Ingredients and Advantages of all the severall sorts of Governments.</p>

Though some are Priviledged to be Sheriffs within their Jurisdiction, and so have Power of Life and Death in some cases, yet we may look on our selves as more happy in severall respects, under the Government of the well constitute <hi>Monarchie</hi> we live in, then if Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Power were in our own hands, as many free <hi>Cities</hi> and <hi>Common-Wealths</hi> have.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>First,</hi> Because we are hereby fred from the fear of overthrow, oppression, or subjection to the lust of any proud or ambitious Neighbour, that perchance might have more Strength then we, being under the Fatherly Care and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of such a Powerfull <hi>Monarch.</hi> When we look back upon the manyfold dangers, that Famous and Renowned <hi>Cities</hi> have frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly been assaulted with in Elder times, or at present Beholds the many staggerings, and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent agitations, that free <hi>Towns</hi> have been sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised with in this our Age; by reason of the Power, Ambition, and Avarice of their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidious Neighbours: we may bless GOD for our Peace and Security.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> If any intestine jarrs may unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily arise amongst <hi>Citizens,</hi> which may draw Parties to Factions, and great Animosities and Seditions; wherethrough not onely the Names, Fames, and Estates of the Inhabitants might be in hazard: but the Lives, Liberties, and Interests of the <hi>Common-Wealth</hi> might utterly
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:106993:13"/>
be destroyed and subverted thereby. We have the Supream Authority of this <hi>Kingdom,</hi> to prevent all these evils, and to crush them in the bud; whereby our Concord, Unity, and at least our Peace and Security is through Gods blessing safer then the great Imperiall Citie of <hi>Rome,</hi> when lyklie to have teared out her own bowells, by that unnaturall War betwixt <hi>Sylla</hi> and <hi>Marius,</hi> which destroyed the chiefest and best of her <hi>Senators,</hi> and so many thousands of her own <hi>Citizens.</hi> The like apparent Fate, being wisely and seasonably prevented, (when that unhappy difference arose in <hi>Aberdeen,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Year 1590, called the <hi>Common-Cause</hi>) by the Prudence and Authority of King <hi>JAMES</hi> the sixth, and the Interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of the <hi>Convention of Burrows,</hi> who by the <hi>Kings</hi> approbation, did determine the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie, which before, through slaughter and blood, had drawn to that hight, which if not timely adverted unto, might have brought with it destruction and desolation.</p>
                     <p>Whereas, since the Government is so regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, as is above shewed, and established upon surer fundations then formerly; that through GODS Blessing thereupon, no such thing hath had any appearance since, not (we hope through Mercy) shall ever again.</p>

                        <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>self-conceit</hi> hath occasioned ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie evils both in <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State</hi>: But I shall say as the <hi>Apostle</hi> said, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12 3. <hi>For I say through the grace given to me, to every man that is amongst you, not to think of himself more highly nor he ought to think, but to think sober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, according as GOd hath dealt to every man the measure of faith.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This <hi>Vertue</hi> will not permit any rash course to be taken, but will make men carry them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves moderatly; both in Prosperity and Adversity.</p>
                     <p>This will not let Rulers imperiously Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, as through passion or hastiness to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse the <hi>Citizens,</hi> and to encroach upon their just liberties and priviledges; but wisely and moderatly perswade and exhort where that can take effect, and to do nothing by force; because power is in their hands, which is very unsuteable, yea most detestable in a free <hi>City,</hi> and amongst a free people, unless inevitable necessity require it.</p>
                     <p>This will not permit a <hi>Magistrate</hi> to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated or lifted up in his mind, but will sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press that vanity and ostentation that many are subject to. <hi>Valerius Publicola</hi> was most imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table in this: That when the people of <hi>Rome</hi>
                        <pb n="36" facs="tcp:106993:19"/>
had expelled their <hi>Kings,</hi> and they with the <hi>Senate</hi> had conferred the supream Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty upon him; yet he used it most soberly and modestly, and of his own accord, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed <hi>Spurius Lucretius</hi> for his Collegue, and because he was a man of a greater age, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed transferr the <hi>Rods</hi> or <hi>Magistraticall En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes</hi> on him.</p>
                     <p>By the exercise of this <hi>Vertue,</hi> all excess in meat and drink will be eschewed, and all va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity or prodigality in apparell evited and curbed; and here I cannot but mention the commendable <hi>Laws</hi> made by <hi>Zaleucus</hi> to the <hi>Locrenses,</hi> to this purpose.</p>
                     <p>Amongst many good <hi>Laws</hi> for that <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Wealth</hi> to bear down the pride of women, He appointed that no woman whatsoever should wear Gold, or any precious or costly Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; unless they did publickly profess them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves Whores: nor that men should wear Gold-Rings, or Milesian-Garments, unless they should be looked upon as Whore-Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters or Adulterers: whereby <hi>Diodorus</hi> sayes, through fear of reproach and shame, he did most wisely curb all excess and superfluitie, which are amongst the Vices that wrong a <hi>Citie</hi> or <hi>Common-Wealth.</hi> If there were more of this Vertue in <hi>Cities,</hi> there would not be such unlimited deboarding in rich and costly Apparell; that there is nothing the most Noble
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:106993:19"/>
in the Land can wear, but <hi>Citizens Wives</hi> and <hi>Daughters,</hi> yea sometimes of the meaner qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity must have it, if they can reach it. It were very suteable to the Wisdom of a grave <hi>Senate</hi>; by Penall Laws, to restrain these ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses which neither GODS Law, nor Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science can bear down. Its sad to see, when diverse <hi>Acts of Parliament</hi> have been made to restrain this excess, and yet, that <hi>Magistrats</hi> and <hi>Councils</hi> should let them perish, through their slackness and want of Zeal to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Good.</p>
                     <p>The best fruits of this Prodigalitie in a <hi>Citie,</hi> is to uphold and increase Pride, Emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, Lust, and to diminish particular mens Estates; which should relieve and uphold the <hi>Common-Wealth</hi> under incident Burdens. It were more praise worthie, if the expense made upon costly Apparel, (beyond what might serve a comely and due decency) were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed upon Gardens and Orchyards, in and about each Town, which would be more use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for the health, life and pleasure of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; and would be comely Ornaments to a <hi>Citie,</hi> and yeeld in time good profit.</p>
                     <p>I would have all Christian Women mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that command, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.3, 4, 5. <hi>Whose adorning, let it not be that outward adorning, of plaiting the hair, or wearing of gold, or putting on of apparell: but let it be the hidden man of

the heart, which is not corruptible even the orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of GOD of great price. For after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of old time, the holy Women also who trust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in GOD adorned themselves, being in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to their own husbands.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In this was the bravery of holy Women in old times, who desired to be in more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem with GOD then with men.

                     <p>By this Factions are made, heart-burnings kindled, discords multiplyed, malice and wrath fostered, pride nourished, and the best and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiest depressed, vvhen the emptiest and vvorth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less are advanced, the good of the publick neglected, yea many times overturned, if not destroyed: As may be seen in the example of <hi>Sylla</hi> and <hi>Marius, Pompey</hi> and <hi>Cesar,</hi> through vvhose ambition and inordinate desire, to have all the Government in their Persons, <hi>Rome</hi> lost a greater number of Citizens, then she did by the propagation of her Empyre over the vvorld, and though vve vvho live under <hi>Monarchical Government,</hi> are not in such hazard
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:106993:21"/>
to ruine our selves, that Parties and Factions dare come to that hight, as these <hi>Cities</hi> that had Soveraign Povver, and none above them to overavv them; yet sure I am, great are the prejudices and decayes these ambitious and fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious persons bring upon a <hi>City,</hi> for vvhate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver one person speaks or does, vvhether it be according to reason or not, the other does al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvayes oppose it.

                     <p>Now this <hi>Ambition</hi> and <hi>joyning work</hi> is for the most part carried on with the inferiour sort of people, that have hand in Elections as some <hi>Deacons of Trades.</hi> I desire not that I should be so understood, as meaning by all <hi>Deacons of Trades</hi> in generall, for I doubt not but many amongst them are discreet, ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and sober men, that will not comply with any design prejudiciall to the publick well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of their respective <hi>Towns</hi>: for these who are greatest sticklers for strengthning of Fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and promoting of themselves, finds them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves concerned to invite these to Taverns, and keep meetings at drinkings and collations at unseasonable houres, whereby to work u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon

the minds of these men, to gain their votes and secure their designs, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering that by such means any naughty person may be gotten easily preferred to the most deserving, that cannot comply with these wayes or the humors of such men. Even as it fell out with <hi>Pub. Scipio Nasica,</hi> (to whom the <hi>Senate of Rome</hi> for his many notable ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices to the <hi>Common-Wealth,</hi> had given the Title of <hi>A brave and most Excellent Man,</hi>) when he was upon the list to be <hi>Aedilis,</hi> or <hi>Master</hi> of the Publick Works or Houses, taking an labouring man by the hand, which he found very hard, (as hardy <hi>Craftsmen</hi> uses to be) asked in jeast, whether he walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on his hands or feet? which the <hi>Tradsman</hi> taking so ill, many being round about him, it went presently through all, and was the cause of an repulse to that excellent man, because they thought he mocked them. Yea, was not <hi>Paulus Aemilius</hi> often repulsed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he would not joyn: And was not that brave <hi>Fabius Maximus</hi> repulsed, and <hi>Terentius Varro</hi> preferred to be <hi>Consul</hi> by the votes of the Vulgar, (though he was none of the <hi>Patricii</hi> or <hi>Nobility,</hi> but come of the <hi>Plebeian</hi> sort,) and had thereby almost ruined and lost the whole Estate of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the <hi>City</hi> it self, after the Famous Battell of <hi>Cannae,</hi> lost by his temerity and folly.</p>

Wherefore it were a work worthy not onely of the <hi>Councils</hi> of particular <hi>Burghs,</hi> but of the grave and judicious Meeting of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of the whole <hi>Burrows,</hi> to take away so far as can be, this bitter root which hath troubled the <hi>Burghs</hi> of these Kingdoms so long with so many sad fruits. The <hi>Romans</hi> made Laws against it, other <hi>Cities</hi> to cure it, did choose their <hi>Senators</hi> and <hi>Councils</hi> by Lot, as <hi>Florence</hi> and <hi>Sienna,</hi> which often proves dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous. The <hi>Venetians</hi> mix Lots and Elections together unto this day, of purpose to bear down Ambition, whereby great Concord is preserved, and their State hath flowrished won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully, having stood above eleven hundred Years. And if the Zeal of these Wise and Potent <hi>Cities</hi> for the preservation of their <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Liberties</hi> be such, in the care they take in their Elections, though these things amongst us be of so far less importance, even beyond all comparison; yet Christians in their Sphere though never so low, ought to be no less carefull to bear down Sin, and to be tender of the Honour of GOD, which suffers not a little often times by these things.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore, I must recommend it to be thought upon in an effectual way, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident, the <hi>KING, Parliament</hi> and <hi>Council,</hi> will be ever ready to ratify what may be in this for the Honour of GOD, and the good of such a part of the body of the <hi>Kingdom.</hi>

2.

                     <p>Its reported that the Famous and most E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquent <hi>Orator Demosthenes,</hi> had no great promptness or naturall parts, but onely by Pains and Industrie, became to outstirpt all in <hi>Greece</hi>; yet when provocked, he would speak nothing immediatly, till he had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediated in his Nocturnall Lucubrations what he was to say: which occasioned <hi>Pythius</hi> an <hi>Athenian Orator</hi> to say, <hi>That Demosthenes Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions did smell of a lamp.</hi> Also, when expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diency would require, that he should speak for himself <hi>ex tempore, Demades</hi> behooved to plead for him, who was very prompt, and did excell all others in an extemporanean dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, being by Nature and Ingyne far a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all others in <hi>Athens,</hi> tho by pains and industrie <hi>Demosthenes</hi> did far outstrip them all.</p>
                     <p>It falls often out, that painfull and diligent men will do far more, then many that are of much greater naturall Parts; for care and diligence will supply what is wanting in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

                     <p>Its reported in <hi>Ecclesiastical History,</hi> that when some persons came to see <hi>John the Apostle,</hi> through the Fame they heard of his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Gravity, they found him feeding a Bird, who perceiving they wondred some what at him, as being disappointed of their expectation, takes the Bows which were in their hands, and asks them why they did not alwayes keep them bended?

4. <hi>Augustus Caesar</hi> having changed <hi>Capreae</hi> for the Island of <hi>Inarime</hi> with the <hi>Neapolitans,</hi> that he might retire thither for his health, did build there a glorious PALACE, which he made use of for honest recreations when wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with business. Recreations are not onely lawfull but expedient, yea sometimes neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, but when men are too much in them, and at unseasonable times, they are sinfull and very unbeseeming any, but especially publick persons; for then not onely is time lost, but oft times needfull and weighty business neglected, justice delayed, the poor and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed not relieved. Even as <hi>Tiberius</hi> abused that Island exceedingly, which <hi>Augustus</hi> did use soberly, for he went thither to befool himself thorow sordid neglect and sloth, and when he was to depart from <hi>Rome,</hi> set out an Edict that none should call for him, and sent some of his Train before, that all who in his journey thither were like to meet him, might be put out of the way and no person to come to him; that being entered this <hi>Isle,</hi> he might lay all care of the Empyre aside: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he permitted <hi>Armenia</hi> to be taken by the <hi>Parthians, Mysia</hi> by the <hi>Dacianes</hi> and <hi>Sarma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianes,</hi> and <hi>France</hi> by the <hi>Germans,</hi> with great disgrace and hazard of the whole Empire. He in the mean time taking liberty through the secrecy of the place, which was guarded
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:106993:25"/>
on every side with high Rocks, and no entry thereto but a narrow shoar, did abundantly and freely discover the ill dissembled vices of his mind: And with <hi>Pomponius Flaccus, L. Piso</hi> spent both dayes and nights in feast<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ng and drinking. To the One he gave the <hi>Province</hi> of <hi>Syria</hi>; to the Other, the Government of the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> calling these his most jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viall Friends and Companions for all seasons.</p>
                     <p>His greatest delight of that <hi>Isle</hi> was, that there he could execute his cruelty more easily, (wherein he took singular pleasure) for whom ever he did hate, after most exquisite and long torments, he caused throw them into the Sea. Its sad when the lawfull recreations of some, are turned into such excess by others, that they become their shameful snares and sins.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>Demetrius</hi> King of <hi>Macedon,</hi> in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his Reign, was exceedingly given to sluggishness, and delighted onely in solitary idleness, that it was very hard and difficult to get access to him, which was the more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cented by his Subjects, that King <hi>Philip</hi> had been so accessible, that any might have got audience from him at all times. It fell out that an old woman finding the King not busie, requested him to hear her graciously: The King replyed somewhat passionatly, that he had not leasure to hear her, but she fastning her eyes cryed out, that he should not be a King
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:106993:25"/>
if he irked to hear: <hi>Demetrius</hi> considering and becoming more mild, gave her audience at great length, and did her business and sent her away with very affable words; and after he had pondered the words of the old wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, he changed his way and became very accessible and gracious to all that made ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress to him, so that a great part of the day he spent in hearing and giving answers; not without great profit and delight.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. By all this, I would desire a due dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in all Affairs, with that seriousness that becomes, not excluding seasonable and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate divertisment, which will rather whet then blunt the Rational Faculties for their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per exercises. And that neither <hi>Magistrat</hi> nor <hi>Council</hi> may satisfie themselves with the name of their charge, nor with the forme of their appointed dyets and meetings: but labour to consider the particular affairs of the <hi>Town,</hi> and of their respective Charges and to consider of every good and laudable Motion that concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the same, and not think it sufficient to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the same in words, or with a verbal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent; but so to entertain it, and prosecute all these publick concernments, as not onely to stop the mouth of any that may challenge them of neglect; but fully to have the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer of a good Conscience towards GOD, before whom they have lifted up their hands

to be faithful in their charges and imployments.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. And here I judge it not unfit to offer it to consideration, that as this is a Duty of persons in publick trust to mind their own Administrations; so it were worthy of a Judicious <hi>Senate,</hi> that would advert to every thing commendable in a <hi>Common-Wealth,</hi> to study all wayes and means to check the idleness and negligence of all within their Corporation: especially of the Youth, whose spirits being naturally in the greatest heat, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fittest for action, would be carefully keept at vertuous Imployments, which by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of GOD may greatly conduce to the good of the <hi>City,</hi> and preservation thereof in its pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity; otherwayes if <hi>Idleness</hi> get liberty, all the activity of their Spirits will vent it self in Vice, which is not onely their personal ruine, but the decay of the whole Body in a short progress of time.</p>

take notice of the word: <hi>Prov.</hi> 22.29. <hi>Seest thou a man diligent in his business, he shall stand before</hi> KINGS, <hi>he shall not stand before mean men.</hi> Here a promise of Honour and Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the carefull and the diligent, and this is a commendable and most lawfull way of seeking preferment, if when a man from a right Principle out of Conscience of Duty, studies a sedulous carefulness and diligence in all he is called to go about.

                     <p n="11">11.

                     <p>What greater corruption could appear, then in <hi>Fabius Maximus</hi> in his Youth, but when he came to ryper Years, there was nothing wanting in him that could be for compleating the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantest of men; to whom the Surname of <hi>Allo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brogis</hi> was given, in honour of the Victory ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained over the <hi>Gaulis</hi> or <hi>Frenches</hi> by his parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular

                     <p>Let all that are sensibly touched with a deep impression of their unfruitfulness and usless life, improve by Faith and Prayer, that refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Promise, <hi>Psalm.</hi> 92.12, 13, 14. <hi>The righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous shall flourish like the palm-tree: he shall grow like the cedar in Lebanon.

When he was going out of the Town, he lift up his hands to Heaven, not with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precations against his <hi>Citizens,</hi> but prayed to the most High GOD, that all things here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after might befall the <hi>Athenians</hi> so happily and successfully, that there might be no more oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to remember <hi>Aristides.</hi> Examples might be multiplied, to show how <hi>Envy</hi> hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed many excellent Men, and rendered them uncapable to do their <hi>Countrey</hi> or <hi>Common-Wealth</hi> service.</p>

Scripturall instances, that may deterr them from so base a Vice. Let such consider, that <hi>Envy</hi> is a disease that torments themselves, more then it can do the person whom they envy; Therefore <hi>Antisthenes</hi> said, <hi>that as rust eats iron, so does envy the person that envyeth. Solomon</hi> sayes, <hi>Its rottenness of the bones. Prov.</hi> 14.30. So <hi>David, Psal.</hi> 112.10. speaking of the envy of the Wicked to the Righteous, sayes, <hi>They shall gnash with the teeth and melt away. Iob.</hi> 5.2. <hi>Envy slayes the silly one.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="7">7. It was <hi>Envy</hi> that made <hi>Corah, Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram</hi> provoke the LORD, to cause the Earth open her mouth and swallow them up. So <hi>Psal.</hi> 106.16. compared with <hi>Num.</hi> 16.30, 31. <hi>verses.

Its good to keep an equality and carry soberly, not permiting our selves to be blown up with any wind of vain Conceit or Applause from others, nor to hunt after it. Many <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi> have given eminent Examples of Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in shunning all causes of <hi>Envy,</hi> some have removed themselves from their <hi>Native Countrey</hi> of purpose to eschew the <hi>Envy</hi> of their <hi>Citizens</hi>; others have refused Rewards for their most No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Services. As <hi>Pittacus Mytelaeneus,</hi> who was holden for one of the seven Wise Men of <hi>Greece,</hi> for when he had fred his Countrey from <hi>Tirrany,</hi> and had killed <hi>Phrynon</hi> the <hi>Athenian Generall</hi> in a singular Combat, when the Supream Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the <hi>Common-Wealth</hi> was offered to him he refused it, and when his Countrey-Men of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered him great and large Lands, he requested that they would not give him what many would envy, and many more covet: <hi>Wherefore of all these</hi> (sayes he) <hi>I will have no more, but so much as may declare the moderation of my Spirit, and be testimony of your Good Will towards me; for lesser Gifts and Rewards are of greater duration, and great things are scarce thought a mans own.</hi>

I might add many more Instances of the like Sobriety and Moderation in great Persons from several Histories, &amp; particularly from the Famous and ever to be Honoured <hi>Common-Wealth</hi> of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi> where it may be observed, that there was very little personall Ambition, or Affection of airie Applause, for all they contended was for the Good of their Native Countrey, and Wealth and Honour thereof; for they would not admit of Sumptuous Tombs, nor Magnifick Statues, nor the Warlick Ensignes of their Glorious Vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories to be set up as the lasting Monuments of their Vertuous Atchievments: but to give one of the many of such instances, <hi>Caspar Conterenus</hi> that Noble <hi>Venetian,</hi> in the description of the <hi>Venetian Common-Wealth,</hi> showes for proof of this, that <hi>Andreas Contarenus</hi> Duke of <hi>Venice</hi> dying shortly after that most remarkable Overthrow he had given the <hi>Genoaves,</hi> prohibited by his Latter-Will that no Ensignes or Ducall Coat of Armes, neither his own propper Escotcheon or Name should be engraven on his Tomb, that no person might know where such a Worthy and Well Deserving Person was interred. This and the like, may check the airie and vain Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits that hunt after the vain applause of the World.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. The <hi>Apostle</hi> gives an excellent Direction, (which all that have a right esteem of Gospel Rules will walk by,) <hi>Philip.</hi> 2.3. <hi>Let nothing

and seeing this is so necessar and conduceable for the good of a Corporation, I shall propose these few means that may contribute for the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and preservation thereof when attained.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. In the first place, let there be care taken that all Ranks of Persons have their due Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Priviledges preserved, according to the Rules and Constitutions of the <hi>Common-Wealth</hi>; for incroachments upon these have caused great agitations, yea many alterations in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>Cities,</hi> and sometimes have hazarded the ruine thereof; from this General I shall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance some Particulars.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Let the People bewar, <hi>first</hi> of encroaching upon the Priviledges of the <hi>Councill</hi> and <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strats,</hi> which cannot be done without Mutinies and seditious Meetings, and the most effectuall way to prevent this. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrats</hi> and <hi>Councill</hi> be very tender of the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges and Liberties of the People, to do nothing against them by force or oppression. Hence it was that the People of <hi>Rome</hi> rose up against the <hi>Decem-viri,</hi> when they perceived them to exercise Tirranny and Oppression under the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert of Authority: Therefore, by sedition and slaughter they were thrust out, and a new Government erected. So also the Thirty <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors</hi> of <hi>Athens</hi> (whom <hi>Lysander</hi> the <hi>Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> had set up, after they had with Poison and Sword destroyed many Famous Worthie Men)
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:106993:33"/>
were destroyed and overturned by <hi>Thrasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulus,</hi> which <hi>Socrates</hi> that Divine <hi>Philosopher</hi> foretold before he drank that deadly Poisonous Cup at their Decree. Therefore, <hi>Magistrats</hi> would rather moderate their Power by Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, then bend and strain it up to the hight.

                        </gap>gh neglect, or (which is worse) willfully slighted and transgressed; it leaves a staine of unjustice and baseness upon the guilty: Wherefore, it is not onely the Reverence which we ow to Authority, but the Justice and Equity of the <hi>Lawes</hi> that should engage all good Men to yeeld Obedience to the Statutes of the Nation.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It may be asserted without prejudice to Truth, as these that are best acquaint with the <hi>Lawes</hi> at home and abroad knowes, there are few Nations (if any) that can be said to have better <hi>Lawes</hi> then we of this Nation have had: so that if there should be found any neglect, it would be the default of care and diligence, yea of the fidelity of those to whom the execution of them is committed. The best remedy whereof, is to have good, able and conscientious <hi>Office-bearers.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. Yet I shall not desire to be so understood, as if I thought it Duty implicitly to obey all Publick <hi>Lawes,</hi> for I know a State may erre, and have erred as well as a Church; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Parliaments</hi> have found cause to repeall and nullifie many <hi>Acts</hi> and <hi>Lawes</hi> made by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer <hi>Parliaments,</hi> and in caise of errour (which a man by his private Judgement of discretion
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:106993:37"/>
may discern) it is sin to obey. For though the Authority be lawfull, yet it may make wrong Acts, which according to the Law of GOD, (who is the onely Supream <hi>Law-giver</hi>) cannot be lawfully keeped, upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count <hi>Israel</hi> is threatned, <hi>Micah</hi> 6.16. <hi>For the statutes of Omri are kept and all the works of the house of Ahab, and ye walk in their counsels, that I should make thee a desolation, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants thereof an hissing: therefore ye shall bear the reproach of my people.</hi>

                     <p>In this caice, I say when a Lawfull Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity <hi>Acts</hi> unlawfully, our duty is to suffer ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then to sin. It is therefore the duty of all to pray earnestly for <hi>Law-givers,</hi> that they might be Governed of GOD to make no <hi>Acts</hi> but what are good and observable, and what are sinfull may be repealled. It is so far from being a duty to obey sinfull ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, which are contrary to the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of GOD, that it argues a people to have no sound Principle of the fear of GOD, but to have more fear and respect <hi>unto men that shall die, and to the sons of men that shall be made as grass</hi>; then to the living GOD, <hi>who hath streached forth the Heavens, and laid the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of the Earth.

                     <p>The other kind of <hi>Lawes</hi> that are to be punctually observed, are <hi>Municipall,</hi> such as are made and enacted in <hi>Councill,</hi> and if ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediency require, Ratifyed in a Publick Head Court, by consent of the whole <hi>Town</hi>: for <hi>Lawes</hi> of greatest and most common concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, are of greatest Authority, when appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by all or most of an Incorporation.

                     <p>When the Inhabitants of a <hi>City</hi> generally did walk so Christianly and so Sweetly together, according to Gospell Rules, that they might give evidence of the fullfilling these blessed Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, <hi>Isa.</hi> 1.25 26. upon which account a Town might be justly termed a <hi>City of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, the Faithfull City,</hi> this was a sure foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of all true Prosperity and Greatness, therefore let all profane and ungodly persons be esteemed the chiefest enemies to a <hi>Cities</hi> wellfare and the Pious and truely Godly the chiefest Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ells and Blessing thereof.</p>

                     <p>I shall in the next place enlarge upon some of these in particular, in the <hi>fourth-Chapter</hi> I did treat of <hi>Religion</hi> at some length, and shall not therefore insist now, but regrate that Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition hath served to greaten more Towns in many Kingdoms of the World, then the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:106993:47"/>
true fear of GOD; and that love that should be amongst Christians. Witness <hi>Rome,</hi> which is so much frequented upon the imagination of her pretended <hi>holy places,</hi> and <hi>false relicts of Saints departed,</hi> and <hi>the supream Authority of her Ecclesiastical Affairs,</hi> and <hi>her Judaick Jubilies,</hi> by which and many more such like Impostures, she hath made <hi>many Nations drunk with the Wine of her Fornications and Whoredomes,</hi> and thereby keeps her self in such greatness, <hi>till the LORD by powring out the vialls Rev.</hi> 16. <hi>burn and consume that seat of the Beast.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Many other <hi>Cities</hi> and <hi>Towns</hi> are also greatly frequented upon superstitious Accounts by Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, as <hi>Loretto in Italy, S Michael in France, Compostella in Spain,</hi> and many other places al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho rough and almost inaccessible. But now when Light hath discovered these <hi>Antichristian-Delusions,</hi> I think we should study upon more Christian Accounts, to invite Strangers (as was said in the beginning of this <hi>Chapter</hi>) by being through divine Grace a holy People, living in the true fear of GOD, and in love to his holy Image, where ever it is to be seen by an holy and blameless Conversation. Though there be a difference in Judgement in most <hi>Cities</hi> now in <hi>Brittain,</hi> let it be our care to love all Men, and seek thee good of every one if so be the LORD may bring them to the knowledge of Himself, and the acknowledgement of the Truth, and
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:106993:48"/>
walk according to that rule, <hi>Phillip.</hi> 3.15 16. This as it is very sutable to Christian Charity, and that meekness and moderation that becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Gospell, so it is very conducible to the greatning of a <hi>City</hi> and <hi>Common-wealth.</hi>

                        <hi>Rulers</hi> ought to have a speciall care to give all due encouragement to Trading that can be thought upon, for by it a <hi>Burgh</hi> is mostly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguished from a <hi>Countrey-Village</hi>; rather then by strong Walls or Fortifications as some dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguish, without <hi>Trade</hi> a <hi>Town</hi> were little better: so that <hi>Traffick</hi> is the very essence, and by it the Being and Vitalls of a <hi>Burgh</hi> or <hi>City</hi> is man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>First,</hi> It therefore concerneth <hi>Magistrats</hi> and
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:106993:48"/>
                        <hi>Councill</hi> to assist, yea, to own as their propper Concernment, all the Intetests that may impare or prejudge the <hi>Traffick</hi> in all <hi>Staple-Commodities,</hi> when the <hi>Supream Authority</hi> makes any <hi>Act,</hi> or are like to do any thing that may damnify the same; as in highting <hi>Customs</hi> or <hi>Bulzeon</hi>: These things would be adverted to, and all opportunities care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully attended when matters of that nature may be best helped, especially at <hi>Parliaments,</hi> for this there is a great necessity to make choise of understanding, able and active men to be <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners</hi> at such times, otherwayes it may fall out to be done at such a time, that possibly can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be gotten helped in an Age.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> It were good to look well upon all these wayes whereby <hi>Trade</hi> is prejudiced amongst our selves, as to take condign order with <hi>Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

<pb n="97" facs="tcp:106993:49"/>
advanced in <hi>Towns,</hi> it being more propper for a <hi>Dean of Gild Court</hi> (which would be need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to be alwayes of the ablest and most judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious of the <hi>Merchants,</hi> and such as are of most publick Spirits,) yet it may not be amiss to offer these things to consideration.</p>
                     <p>Consider to what good improvement one man (as I have seen in my time) did bring the <hi>Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture of Stockings, viz.</hi> G.

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Ut seeing I have been recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending the care of <hi>Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise</hi> to the <hi>Rulers</hi> and <hi>Councils</hi> of our <hi>Cities</hi> and <hi>Burghs, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandise</hi> being an imployment
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:106993:50"/>
whereby not onely <hi>Burghs,</hi> but <hi>Kingdoms</hi> and <hi>Common-wealths</hi> doeth mostly prosper and flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish, if well and rightly improven, therefore it not onely concerns the <hi>Merchants</hi> of the <hi>Burghs</hi> to endeavour the advancement and improvment of <hi>Trade,</hi> but with due submission it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, the Powers and <hi>Rulers</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom</hi> may lay themselves out seriously to encourage it as a speciall concernment lying upon them to promove, seeing it mostly advances the good of the whole <hi>Nation,</hi> and the decay thereof tends so much to the Publick prejudice.</p>
                     <p>Therefore <hi>First,</hi> It is humbly to be wished, that our <hi>Rulers</hi> would take speciall care and make diligent enquiry by the <hi>Custom-Books</hi> and other evidences that are propper, to know whether the <hi>Kingdom</hi> or <hi>Common-wealth</hi> be lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers or gainers by their Trade, by casting the ballance betwixt the value of the Goods im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported into the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and the Goods ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported Yearly; for if there be a greater im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation then there was of exportation, there is so much loss to the <hi>Nation</hi> by how much the importation exceeds the exportation, because the superplus beyond the value of the Goods exported exhausts so much Money which is drawn forth of the <hi>Kingdom</hi> to pay it, and so gradually if the super expense continue, the <hi>Trade</hi> and <hi>Nation</hi> must come to ruine.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>Second</hi> mean of improvement is, that our
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:106993:51"/>
                        <hi>Rulers</hi> would be pleased to take a speciall care of the <hi>Coine</hi> of our own <hi>Nation,</hi> and of the value of <hi>Foreign Coine</hi> imported, and that the Money payed in by the <hi>Merchants</hi> for <hi>Bullion</hi> may be imployed for buying of <hi>Bullion,</hi> so that the <hi>Mint-house</hi> lose not the benefit of the mixture which they must needs lose if they melt <hi>Forraign Coine.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A <hi>Third</hi> is, That they would take care that the <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>States</hi> of <hi>Forraign Nations</hi> may grant Favour that there be no impositions laid on upon the product of our <hi>Countrey,</hi> whereby to debar us from Trade with them, as that <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark</hi> and <hi>Norway</hi> may not obstruct the Trade of our <hi>Victuall, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A <hi>Fourth</hi> is, That there be an encouragment given to the <hi>Fishing,</hi> such as <hi>Code, Herring,</hi> and <hi>Whale-Fishing,</hi> both as to the exportation, and the Goods to be imported by the Money that is purchassed by the same; and withall, that Strangers may be debarred from having the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage that is more propperly due to the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,</hi> for it is reported that the <hi>Governours</hi> of our <hi>North-Isles</hi> are more kind and favourable to the <hi>Hamburgers</hi> then to our own <hi>Natives,</hi> in selling their Fishes to them rather then to our own <hi>Countrey-men.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A <hi>Fifth</hi> is, That speciall notice may be taken how to improve the naturall product of our Land, such as <hi>Coal, Salt,</hi> and all kind of <hi>Grain
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:106993:51"/>
Wool, Hyde, Tallow, Skins, Linning-cloath, Plaiding, Fingrams, Stockings, Salmond, Herring, &amp;c.</hi> As <hi>First,</hi> That <hi>Coal</hi> and <hi>Salt</hi> may be appointed to be transported to the prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Ports as shall be thought most fit, where men may be appointed as Factors to have care thereof, that the exporters be not necessitated to sell at the time of fallen Mercats, since they are Commodities that may wait for a better Mercat without loss, and are such as cannot be wanted.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> As to <hi>Corne</hi> and <hi>Grain,</hi> that care may be had as is said in the <hi>Third Mean,</hi> or <hi>Paragraph</hi> foresaid.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> As for <hi>Skins</hi> and <hi>Hydes,</hi> if we had access to <hi>American-Plantations,</hi> or if a liberty could be procured to a Select Company, and no others to have Trade there but they, then <hi>Skin</hi> and <hi>Hyde</hi> would be a good Commodity, being well Tanned or Barked, or made in Shoes; which would not onely tend to the great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of <hi>Merchants,</hi> but would occasion many Trades-men to be set on work at home in our own <hi>Countrey,</hi> seeing we have attained to a good perfection both in <hi>Barking, Tanning</hi> and <hi>Currying.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> As for <hi>Wool</hi> it needs not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported at all, if our <hi>Manufacturies</hi> at home were carefully looked to; for though we have few or no select <hi>Manufacturies</hi> in this Land, yet
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:106993:52"/>
we can improve the whole <hi>Wool</hi> of the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> to better purpose, and sell cheaper abroad then any <hi>Forraign Manufacture</hi> in the World can afford it, particularly upon <hi>Plaidings, Fing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rams,</hi> or any kind of <hi>raw-Cloaths</hi>; in respect saving of Charges is the life of all <hi>Manufactures,</hi> for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular select <hi>Manufactures</hi> must have servants well appointed both as to bedding and dyet, whereas all the <hi>Wool</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> may be wrought by the Commons of this <hi>Nation</hi> at a very easie rate, because of their sober way of living, and working but at such times as their other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey-work permits. For illustration whereof, it will not be amiss an instance that fell out se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall years ago in my own time, which may evince that the <hi>Plaiding</hi> and <hi>Fingrams</hi> made by the Commons in the <hi>Countrey,</hi> is to much greater advantage, then by setting up a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular <hi>Manufacture</hi> for the said imployment.</p>
                     <p>There was a substantious Merchant in <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> called <hi>Mr. Barnes,</hi> who considering the great Sumes of Money that was brought in to this <hi>Kingdom</hi> by the <hi>Plaiding Trade,</hi> espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially by the Merchants of the Town of <hi>Aber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deen,</hi> who bought mostly all their <hi>Wool</hi> from <hi>Edinburgh</hi> and the <hi>South Parts</hi>; so that they had it but at the second hand, and did sell it out in smalls to the Countrey-People there about, after they had been at Charges for transporting and born the hazard by Sea, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        <pb n="103" facs="tcp:106993:52"/>
Whereas he considering, that he might have <hi>Wool</hi> without any such expense or hazard, and causing make <hi>Plaiding</hi> in a particular <hi>Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture,</hi> there he could not but make greater profit in <hi>Holland</hi> then they of <hi>Aberdeen</hi> could make, seeing he could save such a considerable expense which they were necessitated to ware out: whereupon he sets up his <hi>Manufacture</hi> and wrought about ten <hi>Sea-Packs</hi> of <hi>Plaiding,</hi> which might be reckoned worth twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Pounds; but when he perceived the <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants</hi> in <hi>Aberdeen</hi> did sell their <hi>Plaiding</hi> at as low a rate as his stood himself at home, and yet with advantage, he fell a wondering what could be the reason, and meeting with <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander Farquhar</hi> a <hi>Merchant</hi> in <hi>Aberdeen</hi> his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, enquired how it could be, laying before him the former considerations, to which <hi>Alexander Farquhar</hi> replyed, that the people that wrought their <hi>Plaiding,</hi> had not by farr such entertainment as his servants had, and that they drank oftner clear <hi>spring Water</hi> than <hi>Ale</hi>: and therefore they had their <hi>Plaiding</hi> much cheaper than he had his, whereupon he quickly gave over his <hi>Manufacture.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Notwithstanding that our <hi>Commons</hi> live at such a sober rate, they are so set at work upon the account of their advantage in the <hi>North Parts</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> that in former years the product of their labours hath brought into this <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>
                        <pb n="104" facs="tcp:106993:53"/>
yearly, upwards of an hundreth thousand <hi>rex dollars</hi> for many years together; without this the <hi>Nobility</hi> and <hi>Gentry</hi> in thir parts could not get their Money Rents well payed, which Trade and Employment hath been thir seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall years under great decay, so that the <hi>Plaiding</hi> and <hi>Fingrams</hi> are become to be sold at the half of the value which they did formerly, neither is the half exported, which is mostly upon the account of their deceitfull mismannadgment thereof, which may be helped by appointing particular knowing men, and giving them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance to attend the <hi>Mercats</hi> for visiting and judging the sufficiency of the Cloath, which would augment the quantity, and advance the Price to the value of all the <hi>Wool</hi> that is vented abroad, and unless some such qualified Persons be impowred, and by an setled allowance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to a diligent inspection and judging of the samen, all our <hi>Acts of Parliament</hi> which hath been so commendablie enacted for regulating these things, will prove but ineffectuall as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant experience hath too much evidenced.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Fifth Countrey Commodity</hi> is <hi>Stockings,</hi> which hath been within thir few years admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably improven by one Man in <hi>Aberdeen,</hi> (as was instanced before) to wit <hi>George Pyper,</hi> who encouraged the Countrey People so, by giving them a little money or some linning at times, that from five groats the pair, he caused them
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:106993:53"/>
work at such a fynness that he hath given twenty shillings sterling and upward for the pair: but as the su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ficiency of <hi>Plaiding</hi> and <hi>Fingrams</hi> may be recovered by carefull visitors to the great advantage of the Countrey, so the <hi>Stockings</hi> may be made the more saleable, if the su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of them with the due length and shape both of Men and Womens be diligently obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, for which a gage may be made according to the principall gage, and dispersed through all the Countrey, that no <hi>Stockings</hi> may be censured, or confiscated through ignorance of the owners, and the visitors allowance for his mark and seal appointed, that all Forraign-Countries may come to know the due esteem that our <hi>Stockings</hi> are to be had in.</p>
                     <p>As the neglect of the sufficiencie of <hi>Plaiding</hi> and <hi>Fingrams</hi> have been a great cause of the decay of Trade, so the loss of the <hi>Plantations</hi> by the <hi>Dutch West India Companies</hi> is likewise a considerable cause thereof; which requires that we should wisely consider, how and where we may recover a good off-tract of these Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, for it was the <hi>Dutch Plantations</hi> in <hi>Brasile</hi> (which the <hi>Portuguyes</hi> now possess) that were furnished with our <hi>Plaiding</hi> and <hi>Fingrams</hi> and it were worth the while to consider, if we could find a way with any of these that have <hi>Plantations</hi> in <hi>America</hi> now, or if we could fall upon a way of furnishing the <hi>French King</hi> his
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:106993:54"/>
Armies with these <hi>Scottish Cloaths,</hi> seeing there is no <hi>Nation</hi> in <hi>Europe</hi> can serve them at an easier rate, not onely in <hi>Plaiding</hi> and <hi>Fingrams</hi> but also in such other Cloaths, as <hi>Perpetuanes</hi> and <hi>Sairges.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Sixth Countrey Commodity</hi> named, is <hi>Salmond</hi> and <hi>Herring,</hi> they would be carefully, seen unto, that they be in all points according to the <hi>Acts of Parliament,</hi> particularly the 33 <hi>Act of the first Parliament, K. Charles the</hi> 2<hi>d.</hi> And <hi>Magistrats</hi> to be diligent in their inspection of <hi>Cowpers,</hi> by which that Trade also may flowrish.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>Sixth mean</hi> for improving the Trade of the <hi>Nation,</hi> is that the <hi>Estate of the Burrowes</hi> would humbly petition our <hi>Rulers</hi> in the next <hi>Parliament</hi> that sits, that they would be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to consider the great damnage the <hi>Royall-Burrowes</hi> sustain, and the great discouragment it is to the Trade of the <hi>Nation,</hi> that <hi>Burghs of Regality</hi> and <hi>Barrony</hi> have got so great Priviledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es by the 5<hi>th. Act of the</hi> 3<hi>d. Session of the</hi> 2<hi>d. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of K. Charles the</hi> 2<hi>d.</hi> seeing they may not onely buy in <hi>Mercats</hi> and <hi>Faires</hi> all <hi>Scots Commodities,</hi> the product of the Countrey, and bring all Staple Ware, but they may also ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the same to other <hi>Nations,</hi> and bring home with the money or value thereof, what Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities for the use of the Countrey they think fit, very inconsiderable exceptions being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, notwithstanding that the <hi>Royal-Burrowes</hi>
                        <pb n="107" facs="tcp:106993:54"/>
payes the sixth part of the KINGS <hi>Taxation,</hi> and the <hi>Burghs of Regality</hi> and <hi>Barrony</hi> bear no part nor proportion thereof less or more, notwithstanding of their enlarged Priviledges and great Traffick, which makes little diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt them and <hi>Royall-Burrowes,</hi> as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny understanding man may perceive. And it is the more remarkable, there were severall <hi>Acts of Parliament</hi> rescinded that had been made in favours of the <hi>Royall-Burghs,</hi> which the next <hi>Parliament</hi> may be intreated to take into their consideration, and what was the cause and grounds of these <hi>Acts.</hi> As the 24 <hi>Act of the first Parliament of K. Charles the first.</hi> So <hi>the Act of Ja.</hi> 4. <hi>P.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 84. So <hi>Ja.</hi> 6. <hi>P.</hi> 12. <hi>c.</hi> 152. <hi>Ja.</hi> 6. <hi>P.</hi> 19. <hi>c.</hi> 6. Let the <hi>Burrowes</hi> consider that the <hi>Convention of Burrowes</hi> and the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of the <hi>Deans of Gild &amp;c</hi> are now of little significancy by this late <hi>Act.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Seventhly,</hi> It is worthy of consideration if it be not for the advantage of Trade, that the <hi>Custome</hi> and <hi>Excyse</hi> of Merchant Goods were set and fermed by the generall <hi>Taxmen</hi> to the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall <hi>Burghs</hi> and the precincts of the same, whereby severall inconvenients might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meded, as the <hi>Customs</hi> and <hi>Excyse</hi> of these goods that are brought home to <hi>Burghs of Regality</hi> and <hi>Barrony</hi> which are concealed and no count thereof gotten, whereas the <hi>Sub-taxmen</hi> of the speciall <hi>Burrowes</hi> would be concerned to look
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:106993:55"/>
more narrowly to it then any other.</p>
                     <p>Next, whereas there are heavy burdens of <hi>Taxations</hi> lyes on the <hi>Royall-Burghs,</hi> so that many Inhabitants remove from them, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers set up in these other <hi>Burghs,</hi> seeing they enjoy so great Priviledges of Trading to the great decay of the <hi>Royall-Burghs,</hi> as may be evidenced, that a great large Lodging with all accommodations may be had in some of the <hi>Royall-Burrowes</hi> at a great dale more easie rate than a very common thack house in some of these <hi>Burghs of Barrony,</hi> as may be easily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stanced.</p>
                     <p>Next, the <hi>Burgesses</hi> of the <hi>Burghs of Rega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> and <hi>Barrony</hi> getting mostly their <hi>Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise</hi> stollen free of <hi>Custome</hi> and <hi>Excyse,</hi> thereby are in a capacity to under-sell the <hi>Merchants</hi> of the <hi>Royall-Burghs</hi> in such commodities very considerably, to the no little discouragment of the <hi>Royal-Burghs,</hi> for they may sell their wares as far below others as the <hi>Custome</hi> and <hi>Excyse</hi> will extend to, so that the <hi>Merchants</hi> of <hi>Royall Burghs</hi> need look for no change, so long as the other hath these commodities.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Eightly,</hi> It would be much for the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Trade</hi> as is conceived, if our <hi>Rulers</hi> would ordain a competent number of Knowing <hi>Merchants</hi> out of the principall <hi>Burrowes</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> to meet at such seasons and places as shall be appointed and thought most expedient,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:106993:55"/>
for considering and fixing upon a solid way, for puting in practise all good Overtures, which they or any other may suggest unto them for promoving the Prosperity of the <hi>Trade</hi> of the <hi>Nation.</hi> And for the further assistance of these, it were good that the <hi>Convention of Burrowes</hi> would appoint the <hi>Magistrats</hi> of every <hi>Royall-Burgh,</hi> to ordain some of the most Understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of their Inhabitants, to meet at such times as they shall judge fit to consider, debate and argue anent the Trading with these Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities which are most in use by the <hi>Merchants</hi> of the respective <hi>Burghs</hi>; and what Overtures they can fall upon for improving the samen and when they have agreed and condescended there upon, to give an account thereof subscribed with their hand, or the hand of their <hi>Praeses</hi> chosen by them, to the <hi>Provest, Bailies</hi> and <hi>Councill</hi> of the place, and they to give in the same after a serious revieu and consideration to the <hi>Convention of Burrowes,</hi> or any <hi>Committie</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligated by them for that effect, and that they may consider, and approve or disapprove the samen, and give in their Reasons accordingly to the <hi>Committie</hi> of <hi>Trade</hi>; that so after a serious and solid consideration thereof, it may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended to the <hi>Parliament,</hi> or the KINGS <hi>Councill</hi> for their Approbation and Authority.</p>
                     <p>But if it be said that few will be at the pains to wait upon such meetings to consider things so
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:106993:56"/>
rypely, to the neglect of their own affaires, as the proposall seems to require.</p>
                     <p>To which it may be answered, If the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the matter be duely weyed, and the weighty results seriously considered, it will be found well worth all the pains and expenses that can be wared, if the Affair be not altogether turned into a meer formality.</p>
                     <p>But particularly let all concerned consult and consider the great Revenue these improvment would raise to the Crown, by the <hi>Customs</hi> and <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyse,</hi> the Honour, Fame and Esteem it would pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase to our <hi>Nation</hi> abroad, the great increase and encouragment it would be to <hi>Sea-men</hi> and <hi>Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,</hi> the plentifull and comfortable livelyhood of severall hundreds and thousands of Familie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T were a most commendable piece of Government, if <hi>Rulers</hi> would be at pains to set down wayes how every idle person within <hi>Cities</hi> and <hi>Towns</hi> might be discovered, and strict accounts thereof be exacted accordingly, that all Persons of every Rank might be known, how, and by what means they live, by what Trade, Industrie and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue they mantained themselves and Families.</p>

GOD created Man in his primitive Innocency and Integrity, he placed him in a <hi>Garden,</hi> and put that exercise upon him, even in a sinless state to dress and keep it. <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.8, 15. whence it may be observed, that <hi>Planting</hi> and the care thereof is an exercise not unbecoming the best of Saincts, nor the Greatest of men, we may see many Proofes o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I could name many Great men that have taken pleasure in Planting, as <hi>Cyrus the younger, King of Persia,</hi> who planted <hi>Orchards</hi> and <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens</hi> with his own hand.

                     <p>Therefore, I shall close this purpose with a friendly desire that all <hi>Magistrats</hi> and <hi>Town-Councils</hi> may seriously consider, how they may in this give best obedience to the laudable <hi>Acts</hi> and <hi>Laws</hi> of the Land, and with most profit and satisfaction to their respective <hi>Incorporations,</hi> and that it may be remembered, when <hi>Adam</hi> sinned he was sent forth from the <hi>Garden of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> to till the ground, which was a more pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and inferiour employment and not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to enjoy that sweet and refreshful mansion of the <hi>Garden.</hi> It was a part of Gods Curse upon a land, when Trees were smitten and taken away from it. <hi>Exod.</hi> 9.25. <hi>Amos</hi> 4.9. <hi>Joel</hi> 1.12.

                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> He must be a man of Courage, that will doe what ever he finds to be his Duty, notwithstanding of all opposition from men, <hi>Psal.</hi> 82.3, 4. <hi>Defend the poor and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therless, deliver the poor and needy, and rid them out of the hand of the wicked.</hi> Men that would perform such Duties would needs be men o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Spirit, for so doth the word <hi>Defender</hi> and <hi>Deliverer</hi> import: hence it is, that Faithfull <hi>Rulers</hi> are called <hi>Patres Patriae, Fathers of their Countrey,</hi> because defenders of their Countrey, because defenders and deliverers. Therefore one that will be boasted, and put from their Duty by the threat of a greater person, or down cast of countenance from men, or the like; is not fit to be a <hi>Magistrat.</hi> Men of Spirit and Courage will not be frighted from their Duty by any thing, but will hazard all that is dearest to them in the discharge of a necessary Duty, (the Rules of Prudence being duely and discreetly observed) and for this ought not to be judged as proud or will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, for the work is the LORDS, and therefore hath the promise of his presence and out-bearing. 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 19.6, 11.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> An able man is a wise man, and this teacheth not onely the Duties themselves, as to the matter, but reacheth the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of them, as the time, place and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of doing them. So <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.15. <hi>By me</hi> (sayes Wisdom) <hi>Kings Reign, and Princes decree Justice.</hi> And <hi>vers.</hi> 20. <hi>I lead in the way of Righteousness, in the midst of the paths of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> So that a man by Wisdom will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose not onely a good end, and endeavour to perform a good Duty, and also will use right means, and so circumstantiat it, as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:106993:65"/>
very step and path of his way shall be in Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes. A wise man ponders all his actions. <hi>Psal.</hi> 112.5. <hi>He will guide his affairs with dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion,</hi> discerning when to doe, and when to forbear; and the manner how, and how not every thing is to be done, thus much for an able man.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> He must be a man fearing GOD, not a man wicked in life and conversation, for Power without Piety is but armed injus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, and if he be an active man that can do much, he will be sure to do much mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief. I think it a bad maxime, that an ill man may be a good <hi>Magistrat,</hi> it seems to have more truth in it, that he that hath no care to reforme himself, will never have care to reforme others. <hi>Magistrats</hi> are called Gods, <hi>Psal.</hi> 82.6. <hi>I said ye are Gods.</hi> And it were well that they did represent more of Divine Perfections, and it is a shamefull thing to see a man in honour have no likness to GOD in Holiness. The <hi>Emperour Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantius</hi> said, when he had made a discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of these Courtiers who were easily temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to forsake the Christian Religion, <hi>They can never be faithfull to me, that are not faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to GOD.</hi> It is the fear of GOD that makes a <hi>Magistrat</hi> behave himself as one that GOD takes special notice of in all his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministrations, and will be more affraid to do
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:106993:65"/>
any wrong, than if all the men on Earth were to judge him for his actions, ever remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring that word, <hi>Psal.</hi> 82.1. <hi>GOD stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the congregation of the Mighty, he judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth among the Gods.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> He should be a man of Truth, that is, a plain upright man, that loves truth in himself and others, and counts it his duty and dignity to sift it out in all things, and having found it, to embrace and mantain it to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termost; for he will easily prove a false friend that will at any time dare to falsifie truth for his friend: such men cannot be stable and firm in any good duty, neither will he stand for the Truth and Righteousness in an hour of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> He must be a man hating Covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, there is little ground to expect justice from such as are covetous, for <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.21. <hi>Solomon</hi> sayes, <hi>for a piece of Bread that man will transgress,</hi> that is, for any carnall advantage or gain that man will wrest justice, for co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>
                        <hi>Fifthly,</hi> He should be a just man, equall to all, not partiall nor respecting persons, this is holden out from 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.3, 4. <hi>He that

                     <p>
                        <hi>Sixthly,</hi> He must be a man, Gentle, Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fable, not a froward, hasty or passionat man, for such will not patiently endure to hear ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny complaints of the Poor. <hi>Moses</hi> a great Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler is highly commended for his Meekness, <hi>Numb.</hi> 12.3. So CHRIST as a KING is said to be Meek. <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.5.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Seventhly,</hi> He should be an active man, and diligent in prosecution of duty and not lazie.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Eightly,</hi> He should be a man of good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, and known amongst the People, as <hi>Deut.</hi> 1.13.15. Not an obscure and mean man, for Power will arme Skill, I say not that every <hi>Magistrat</hi> in a <hi>Town</hi> must be worth so many Thousands <hi>&amp;c,</hi> but he had need to have so much as he may live honestly upon, without being necessitated to use any <hi>Trade</hi> or <hi>Employment</hi> unbeseeming his <hi>Office.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It was a fault amongst the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> justly taxed by <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and esteemed to be one of the causes of the ruine of that great and mighty <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> that in their choise of their <hi>Magistrats,</hi> they had a greater regard to rich men then to men of worth and vertue, and
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:106993:66"/>
their reason was, because men of great Estates might the more easily attend the Effaires of the <hi>Common-wealth</hi>: therefore, when men are rich and vertuous also, they are preferable to all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. But this was a ready way to open a door to all avarice and fraud said that great <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher,</hi> and to take the Government from the Noble and truely Vertuous, and monopolize it into the hands of a few covetous ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious rich men, whereas they might have easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and in duty ought to have prevented it, by taking such order that the best men, and these of greatest abilities and vertues might not onely abstain from base <hi>Callings</hi> and <hi>Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> when they were actually <hi>Magistrats,</hi> but also when they were out of <hi>Office,</hi> so that Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration in their Government might have been cured, and their ruin happily prevented.</p>
                     <p>It were good policie to prefer the Vertuous though meaner, than the vicious and unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy though richer for it were fit he did excell other men though not in Riches and Estate, yet in Wisdom, Piety, Courage and better Qualifications. <hi>Prov.</hi> 12.26. <hi>The Righteous is more excellent than his neighbour.</hi> Its such that prepares their heart for their Duty and will make conscience of diligence therein, and seek the advancement of the interests of CHRIST, the <hi>Cities</hi> prosperity and the good of all and every one under their Charge, and for this I
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:106993:67"/>
would recomend to all <hi>Magistrats</hi> to study these <hi>Scriptures</hi> well. <hi>Psal.</hi> 75.2. <hi>Psal.</hi> 101.8. <hi>Psal.</hi> 82. throughout.</p>
                     <p>But some say, we cannot find <hi>Magistrats</hi> with such Qualifications in every <hi>Town,</hi> and therefore we must take them as we have them.</p>
                     <p>I Answere, That should not hinder to set down all the best Qualifications which are to be wished in <hi>Magistrats,</hi> and which all good <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrats</hi> ought to study to have, and <hi>Cities</hi> are to choise the best they can have, seeing the Holy <hi>Scriptures</hi> have recomended such Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications, we ought to pray that GOD would raise up many such, and then we must do as we may, when we cannot do as we would.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore, having hinted at the good Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities <hi>Magistrats</hi> should have, I shall also touch a little what a sad thing it is for a <hi>City</hi> to have ill men to be their <hi>Rulers,</hi> because <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traria juxta se posita clarius elucescunt. Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries set together, make both the more discernable.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Psal.</hi> 82.5. <hi>David</hi> regrates this as a sad judgement in his time, that men in Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity were ignorant and perverse, <hi>&amp;c. They know not neither will they understand, they walk on in darkness</hi>: and therefore he subjoyns, <hi>All the foundations of the Earth are out of course.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>They know not,</hi> This implyes not so much a blockish ignorance, for it is like they might
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:106993:67"/>
have naturall Parts like other men, but they know not that GOD stands among them, that His eye is on them taking speciall no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of their iniquity and injustice and bearing more favour to the wicked, nor to the poor and innocent.</p>
                     <p>Next, though they may read in the <hi>Scriptures</hi> that GOD stands among them, and notices their doings, yet <hi>They will not understand,</hi> this holds out their perversness, and willfull Atheism, as <hi>Psal.</hi> 10.11. <hi>He hath said in his heart, GOD hath forgotten: he hideth his face he will never see it.</hi> vers. 13. <hi>He hath said in his heart, Thou wilt not require it,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he boldly dares to do any injustice that his lusts will put him to, though it be really in the presence of his Great Judge.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>They walk on in Darkness,</hi> Though their Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty were never so clearly hold out to them, they will not yeeld to the Obedience of it, but walk on after the perverse dispositions of their own hearts, and their obstinate wills, and not the pure Word of GOD, and His revealed Will.</p>
                     <p>In this caise the <hi>Psalmists</hi> conclusion will hold, <hi>That all the Foundations of the Earth are out of course,</hi> that is, all <hi>Judges</hi> and <hi>Judicatories</hi> which ought to be refreshfull to the Poor, needy and oppressed, that ought to strengthen the hands of them that do well, and to be a terrour to

evil doers, are now running in a just contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry course and <hi>when the foundations are destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, what can the Righteous doe, Psal.</hi> 11.3.

                     <p>From all this it may be seen, the great bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing it is to a <hi>City</hi> or <hi>Town</hi> to have faithfull, able and pious Rulers, <hi>Prov.</hi> 29.2. <hi>When the righteous are in authority the people rejoyce, but when the wicked beareth rule, the people murmur.</hi> It is therefore an incumbent duty on all to pray, that the LORD would raise many able men up in their respective <hi>Towns,</hi> and also to seek it of GOD to make all the present Incumbents that are in Authority among them, to be such as they ought to be.</p>

I presume next, to set down the Duties of the severall <hi>Magistrats</hi> and <hi>Office-Bearers,</hi> that use to be chosen out of the number of our <hi>Councils</hi> at every Years Election. This is not that I presume to know these Duties better than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, but for the satisfaction of new Entrants, who have not had occasion to be acquainted with such Employments.</p>
                     <p>The first and chiefest <hi>Magistrat</hi> in all <hi>Burghs-Royal</hi> is the <hi>Provest.</hi> Who in <hi>England</hi> is called <hi>Mayor,</hi> the <hi>Romans</hi> called him <hi>Consul. quia be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne Rei-pub. consulat</hi> Its his place to have a chief care of all the Effaires and Concernments of the <hi>Common-wealth</hi> and therefore he is not onely to discharge this duty in ordinary and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mergent Affaires, but he is to forsee and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for all things that may conduce to the good thereof; and this care will require serious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of all that may advance the wellfare of the publick, or any part thereof, and of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny danger or evill that may fall out to the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage thereof, to prevent it and guard against it.</p>
                     <p>

                     <p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> He is to oversee the rest of the <hi>Magistrats</hi> and <hi>Office-Bearers,</hi> that they all doe
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:106993:69"/>
their Duties and acquit themselves diligently in all things that relate to their charge, for its not enough to give good advice and Counsell, if the samen be not put in execution tymeously and seasonably.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fifthly,</hi> He is to be carefull that all the Charters and evidents, and every Paper that is of importance to the <hi>Towns</hi> Concernments be punctualy keeped in the <hi>Towns-Charter-Chists,</hi> or where they ought to be preserved; and not left in any other hands else where, least they may come to be missed, and be in seeking, to the great neglect of these that have the charge of keeping them, which ordinarly is the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest</hi> chiefly and some of the <hi>Bailies.</hi>

                     <p>And yet the <hi>Magistrat</hi> ought not wholly to captivat his Judgement to what ever he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vises, but is bound to ponder well, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise if his Information and Judgement be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the known Laws and common Prat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks of the <hi>Nation,</hi> and according to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science; for this it concernes every <hi>Magistrat</hi> that sits in Judgement, to be a Judicious and Intelligent Person, and one that is care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to have knowledge of the <hi>Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> and Civil Pratticks, lest otherwise he may ignorantly be made to pronounce Decreet which is not according to Equity and Justice, through the partiality of the <hi>Consulter,</hi> who possibly hath been solicited or brybed by the injurious Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and therefore the <hi>Consulter</hi> should be not onely able, but a person of singular Integrity.</p>
                     <p>Next, I judge the whole <hi>Magistrats, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest</hi> and <hi>Bailies,</hi> should advert to all the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars

in the foregoing <hi>Chapters,</hi> which are laid before the <hi>Councill</hi> for the good of the <hi>Town,</hi> as opportunities may be offered and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion given, seeing the <hi>Magistrats</hi> are as the hands, as well as the heads of the <hi>Councill,</hi> to put in execution what ever they enact; for though a <hi>Council</hi> did make all the profitable <hi>Acts</hi> and Constitutions imaginable for the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Good, it were to small purpose if diligent and active <hi>Magistrats</hi> be wanting.

                     </p>

By these foresaid particulars this charge may be seen to be very weighty, for if there should be found gross disorders in the <hi>Town</hi> in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters relating to his Office as before mentioned, it may be justly imputed to the neglect and unfaithfulness of the <hi>Dean of Gild</hi> more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly than to any other of the <hi>Magistrats,</hi> though it still lyes upon them to put him to his Duty if he shall be found wanting.</p>
                     <p>But if a man shall worthily acquit himself in all duties belonging to this Charge, which is without doubt one of the weightiest in the <hi>Common-wealth</hi>; he may remember how the famous <hi>Roman Cato</hi> was surnamed the <hi>Censor,</hi> all his life and ever since also, not as if there had been none in that Office but he: there were many be ore and after him in that Charge at <hi>Rome,</hi> but because he did discharge his Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty most faithfully and diligently, he obtained that designation, as if in that Office he had obtained a victory or gotten a <hi>Triumph.</hi> Even as <hi>Scipio</hi> was sirnamed <hi>Africanus,</hi> from these He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick Victories he obtained there. Wherefore, I shall onely say as <hi>Paul</hi> the <hi>Apostle</hi> said of an El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that ruled well, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17. That he that dischargeth the Office of <hi>Dean of Gild</hi> well, is to be counted worthy of double Honour.</p>

and recorded in the Register, that it be amended against the next Visitation, and if so, the amendment to be recorded, and so the last blot taken off.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> Ye would need to meet together shortly after your Election when every <hi>Office-bearer</hi> hath got his Charge from the <hi>Clerk,</hi> and take every one a day a part, because this work would be done to purpose and not posted over, and cause read over his Charge whom ye call first, and recommend it to his care and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence what is incumbent: with all adding that in respect he will have more time and opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to perceive what is amiss under his Charge, and what will be fit to be done by him, that upon discovery thereof he may acquaint the <hi>Magistrats</hi> or <hi>Councill</hi> that course may be taken therewith as shall be found most convenient. This would be done exactly with every <hi>Office-bearer.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It would be a work very suitable to your place, to fall upon the most Prudent, Judicious and Discreet Men in the <hi>Town,</hi> few or more as ye think fit, with some of your own number, and call them and lay it upon them Authoritatively, to take notice of all dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences,

plyes, mistakes, discords or heart-burnings that fall out amongst neighbours to reconcile them; and accordingly ye ought to call the Parties, and shew them that as <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrats</hi> ye look upon your selves as engaged before GOD amongst other Duties, to keep the Citizens in Peace and Love one to another: and that timely notice be tak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> It were a commendable thing if ye that are <hi>Magistrats</hi> would meet among your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves once every week, and probably it might seem fit at an afternoon before your <hi>Councill-day,</hi> that ye might prepare and rypen matter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> that are under refer for the <hi>Councill,</hi> or what else ye may think fitest to be done in the <hi>Towns</hi> Effaires, this would not onely shorten your work upon <hi>Council-days,</hi> but would evidence that your Actings were done with good advysement and deliberation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fifthly,</hi> It will be worth your consideration, to fall upon a way to make up a publick Liberary of such books as are most fit for qualifying <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrats</hi> and persons in publick trust, such as these that treats of <hi>Kingdoms</hi> and <hi>Common-wealths &amp;c,</hi> and <hi>Laws</hi> thereof and <hi>Histories,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:106993:78"/>
Geographie,</hi> that treat of the manners of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> our own <hi>Acts of Parliaments, Regiam Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestatem,</hi> and generally all other such like Books that may become <hi>Civil Rulers</hi> to be acquainted with. But it may be there are but few ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the <hi>Latin-Tongue</hi> or <hi>French-Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,</hi> that afford severall such, as <hi>Bodin</hi> that writs copiously of a <hi>Common-Wealth</hi> in <hi>French.</hi> So <hi>Franciscus Patricius Senensis</hi> that writs of the <hi>Institution of a Common-Wealth,</hi> and of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of a Kingdom; Wendilini Polititia,</hi> but these are in <hi>Latine</hi> and are old; but there are many <hi>Modern</hi> that may be found at <hi>London.</hi> Also books fit for a <hi>Dean of Gild</hi> and his As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessors, as <hi>Lex Mercatoria, Roberts Map of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce,</hi> the knowledge of the <hi>Sea-Laws,</hi> as the <hi>Roll of Oleron,</hi> or <hi>Consolato of Barcellona, &amp;c.</hi> which being keept in some Publick Place, where the <hi>Magistrats</hi> and <hi>Counsellours</hi> (by the persons that had the trust of them under inventour) might at all occasions have access unto. Sure I am, it were a very commendable thing to have such a Liberary in your <hi>Council-house</hi> which would be at hand, and continually under your eye and care, and might be made use of at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny time convenient.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Ye are with the rest of your Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of the <hi>Town</hi> once every year to ryde your <hi>Land-Marches,</hi> both outward and inward <hi>Marches</hi>; the outward is that ye see that none
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:106993:79"/>
of your <hi>Neighbour-Heritours</hi> encroach upon your <hi>Freedom-Land,</hi> nor upon the properties of your <hi>Fewers.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And the inward <hi>Marches</hi> is, that ye may see none of the <hi>Heritors</hi> of the <hi>Burrow-Roods</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croach upon the <hi>High-Wayes</hi> or beyond the bounds of your March-stones: and while I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion this, it were fit ye should take some effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>se with the High-Wayes or Avenues that come into the <hi>Town,</hi> that horses with loads may come into the <hi>Town</hi> all the Seasons of the Year, in <hi>Winter</hi> as well as in <hi>Summer</hi> and the rather, that ye have the advantage of the publick <hi>Acts</hi> and <hi>Orders</hi> for your assistance therein.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Seventhly,</hi> Were it not worth your serious consideration, to fall upon some suitable way to stirr up all <hi>Magistrats</hi> and privat persons to perform notable services to the wellfare of the <hi>Town,</hi> and to bethink your selves what may be of greatest efficacie to encourage all sorts of persons thereto?</p>
                     <p>I think amongst many other wayes (which ryper judgements may fall upon) it might be a good one to imitate the LORDS own way, set down in <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Then they that feared the LORD spoke often one to another, and the LORD hearkened, and heard it, and a Book of Remembrance was written before him, for them that feared the LORD, and thought
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:106993:79"/>
upon his Name.</hi> See <hi>vers.</hi> 17. <hi>And they shall be mine, saith the LORD of Hosts, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This was a bad time, for they that wrought wickedness were set up, and they that tempted GOD were delivered; and the proud were called happy, and because it was rare to hear any speaking aright of the Wayes of GOD, yet they that feared the LORD did speak often together, and GOD hearkened and heard it, and insert it in a Book of Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance for time to come. <hi>For they shall be mine saith the LORD of Hosts, in that day when I make up my Jewels, and I will spare them, as a man spareth his own son that serveth him.</hi> This was the way the LORD took, even to record notable Service, that in due time he might reward them.</p>
                     <p>So when the LORD blesses any man to do any notable <hi>Act</hi> for the common Good of the <hi>Town,</hi> either for profit or reputation, I think such an <hi>Act</hi> ought to be recorded even in a Register apart, that they and theirs may find the more respect, if there fall an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to manifest it in t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The puting <hi>Mordecai's</hi> good Service on re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, was the occasion of his exaltation, the <hi>Jews</hi> preservation, and <hi>Hamans</hi> destru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Graecians</hi> had their own wayes for stirring up their Citizens to all He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:106993:80"/>
                        <hi>Acts,</hi> but they were deeply tainted with vain glory as their <hi>Triumph</hi> and <hi>Lawrel-Crowns,</hi> as their <hi>Corona Ovalis</hi> of <hi>Myrtle,</hi> for a victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry gotten with little hazard, <hi>Corona Civica</hi> made with leaves of <hi>Oake</hi> for him that saved a Citizen from the Enemie: so also <hi>Corona Populea,</hi> for Young men that were found in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrious and studious in the exercise of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue which was made of Poplar leaves. These were but triviall things, but much intended to gratifie vain glorious humours.</p>
                     <p>But the puting notable <hi>Services</hi> and <hi>Acts</hi> upon record, is for the encouragement of the Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity, and others that may be observers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; and therefore may be done with such so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn circumstances as may be thought fit and most consistent with modesty and sobriety so as the posterity may be influenced to the same, or such like exercises. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.3, 4. They that do good are to have Praise and Rewards from <hi>Rulers</hi> as well as evil doers are to be punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by them who are to be a terrour to such.</p>
                     <p>If these had been recorded, there had been Honourable mention made of many stately Buildings and Monuments in many of our <hi>Royall-Burghs,</hi> which long ere now, or shortly will be quyte forgotten. Neither these <hi>Artists</hi> and privat persons that do good Service, or find out good inventions for profit or or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament to the <hi>Town</hi> should be neglected.</p>

<pb n="160" facs="tcp:106993:81"/>
from this fountain, it concerns all <hi>Magistrats</hi> very near, to be carefull that no gross sin be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged amongst them, such as Whoring, Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenness and Swearing; these are the most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Scandalls unsuitable to the <hi>Gospel</hi> and such as profess it; that are to be found in <hi>Cities</hi> and <hi>Towns.</hi> These are sufficient to provock GOD to withdraw his mercies and to send sad <hi>Plagues</hi> and <hi>Rods</hi>; and to confound all your Counsells and blast your best Endeavours: for suppressing whereof, I know no better outward mean then a conscientious, faithfull and diligent <hi>Court of Justice</hi> keeped by well principled <hi>Magistrats,</hi> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted by pious, honest and zealous <hi>Constables</hi> weekly</p>
                     <p>Now I hope no tender Christian will judge me too presumptuous, to offer to propose a rule to the <hi>Royall-Burrowes,</hi> how they shall bear down these common Vices, seeing I can say it in sincerity, it is more from a respect that I owe to GODS Glory, and the reall regard I have to the Honour and Well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of all the <hi>Burrowes</hi> of <hi>SCOTLAND,</hi> that I humbly hold out my mind unto them in this matter.</p>
                     <p>Therefore I wish that all <hi>Magistrats</hi> in their respective <hi>Towns,</hi> would choose out of every Quarter of their <hi>Town,</hi> four, five or six, well qualified, sober and discreet men, to be <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stables</hi> (it were expedient that some of them
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:106993:81"/>
were members of the <hi>Church-Session</hi>) that with them they might meet and hold a Court every week upon such a day as shall be judged most convenient, and there the <hi>Constables</hi> may give in their delations upon those persons they have found guilty in Whoredom, Drunkenness or Swearing, who may be ordered to be summo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned against the next Court day, that then and there they may be censured and punished ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their merit by Fynes, Imprisonment or so as the <hi>Magistrats</hi> in their discretion shall think fit, not exceeding the censures imposed by <hi>Acts of Parliament.</hi> And for the more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall bearing down of Swearing, it will be found fit that one of the <hi>Constables</hi> with one of the <hi>Towns Officiars</hi> or <hi>Serjants</hi> should go through the <hi>Town</hi> on every Mercat day <hi>per vices,</hi> when the Countrey people are conveened, and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test confluences of people to be seen; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever person they find taking GODS Holy Name in vain, or swearing any other Oath, that they may immediatly exact some small money from every one that are found so doing: and after the Mercat give in all that money to the <hi>Collector,</hi> or to the <hi>Magistrat,</hi> to be laid up for publick use, and a note thereof to be keept in the <hi>Register.</hi> I know by experience, that in few Moneths this way diligently gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout in a <hi>Town</hi> where thousands of people have frequented the Mercat place, there hath
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:106993:82"/>
not the meanest Oath been heard in that place; but it is sadly to be regrated that this Zeal waxes too soon cold.</p>
                     <p>But if any shall object, that <hi>Church-Sessions</hi> or <hi>Consistories</hi> are sufficient to take order with these evils<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and are fitter than any <hi>Magistrat</hi> or <hi>Civil Court</hi>?</p>
                     <p>I answere, It is true, that <hi>Ministers</hi> and <hi>Church-Sessions</hi> continue to do some thing of this according to the custome in <hi>Countrey Parishes,</hi> and some <hi>Acts of Parliament</hi> authorizing them therein; but in this <hi>Polemick-Age</hi> when many things are controverted, which were not ques<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned formerly, it is found a matter very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsick to <hi>Church-Officers</hi> or <hi>Guids,</hi> to meddle with any thing that is propper to the <hi>Civil-Magistrat,</hi> such as Fynes, Imprisonments, or Corporall Punishments, seeing <hi>Magistrats</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>Burghs</hi> may easily perform that Duty, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in <hi>Countrey Parishes</hi> they cannot be so conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently had.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> It may be easie to any understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding men to perceive, how Heteroclit a thing it is to see Preachers speaking to such delinquents more <hi>Magisterially</hi> liker a <hi>Civil Magistrat</hi> than <hi>Ministerially,</hi> menacing their Persons and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting on their Purses, whereas it were more becoming <hi>Ministers</hi> of the <hi>Gospell</hi> to endeavour to awaken and convince their Consciences which is their propper work, because the Weapons of
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:106993:82"/>
their Warfare should not be <hi>Carnall.</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Neither is this design to weaken their hands, but to strengthen them in their propper work; seeing the end of both Courts is to suppress Sin, and it is the more likely to take the desired effect, when <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastick Rulers</hi> do every one their Duty in their propper Sphere.</p>
                     <p>It is more sutable to a Christian <hi>Magistrat,</hi> to execute Justice by Civill Punishments upon delinquents with a tender compassionat heart, and to speak to the Consciences of sinners, then for a <hi>Preacher of the Gospell</hi> to threaten Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Punishments; tho they can pretend to no more zeall then <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John, Luke.</hi> 9.54, 55. whom CHRIST rebuked, saying, <hi>Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of, for the Son of man is not come to destroy mens lives, but to save them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But some may say, why may not this <hi>Court</hi> take order with <hi>Blood-wicks</hi> and <hi>Ryots,</hi> and the breach of all other <hi>Paenall-statutes</hi>?</p>
                     <p>I answere, Not, because this were to encroach upon the Priviledge of the <hi>Dean of Gild,</hi> whose duty it is to accuse and see these convicted and punished that are guilty of the breach of these <hi>Civill-statutes,</hi> and to collect their Fynes, but he used not to notice persons guilty of Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Swearing and Drunkenness, but most or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarly
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:106993:83"/>
these were either laid over to <hi>Church-Sessions,</hi> or altogether neglected and little noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, unless it was Whoredom, and the unfit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and inexpediency of this is spoke to before, which I referr to the <hi>Readers</hi> serious conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
                     <p>Happy were every <hi>City</hi> and <hi>Town</hi> in this Land, if the Zeal (which in some places is often times too apparent for self-interest,) were running in no other channell, but that which is pure, holy and harmless, for the Honour of GOD, and the wellfare of Souls, which in Christian Meekness and Love might sweetly vent it self to the joy of GODS Spirit, edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of all Pious and sober minded People and the conviction of the most stubborn and obstinat offenders.</p>
                     <p>But as the best and most Religious Duties of GODS Worship may degenerat and turn to a form of Godliness without the Power, as 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.5. which feed the fancy, and in some the itching ear with Rhetoricall flowrishes and specious outsyde dresses. 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.3, 4. rather then <hi>building up souls in the most holy faith. Jude</hi> 20. So these means tho never so much strengthned and established by <hi>Law,</hi> may through remissness and want of true Zeal be also turned into a meer form, without any fruit or effect according to the temper and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of the instruments, or the iniquity of
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:106993:83"/>
the times when Sin lifts up its head and comes to that hight of arrogancy and pride, that it will not admit of a check: but however a Duty remains a Duty, and when we cannot do what we would, and impediments become insupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, <hi>In magnis voluisse sat est.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The great and many Advantages that will or may accrue by a diligent prosecuting of this <hi>Justice Court</hi> weekly may be easily perceived, for thereby sin may be duely punished, Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and all Oaths banished out of the streets, and a considerable sum of money collected for the poor and other pious uses, the <hi>Clerks</hi> pains li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berally rewarded as a punctuall Register keeped for that end may evidence, for, as <hi>Uno dato absurdo multa sequuntur.</hi> So one Good cometh never alone.</p>

the <hi>Young-men</hi> of all our <hi>Cities</hi> and <hi>Towns</hi> in the <hi>Nation,</hi> that are born and bred therein: as also, to the Inhabitants and Free-men of our <hi>Cities.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As to the <hi>Youth,</hi> I would have them consider that they are the seed and seminarie of their respective <hi>Corporations,</hi> and that the Blessing and Happiness of a <hi>Town</hi> doth much depend upon them and their behaviour; for if they be Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, Wise and Sober, they may procure in due time, a great commendation to the Place of their Nativity and Residence; if o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwayes, they do what in them ly to draw disgrace and contempt upon it.

                     <p>Wherefore in the first place, I recommend to them in the fear of the LORD, that they would above all make it their care to know GOD and his living Motions in their hearts, whereby he bears witness against all the Sins they are inclyned unto, and points out their Duty and the Way they should walk in, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> By this Old Families may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to many Generations through the blessing of GOD, if not in growing prosperity in Wealth, Credit and Esteem; at least in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of what hath been already attained thereof, as hath been seen in many great and flourishing <hi>Cities</hi> abroad, whereof abundance could be instanced. And this would wear out
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:106993:87"/>
the common reproach put upon <hi>Cities</hi> by the indiscreeter sort of <hi>Gentrie,</hi> who look on them as <hi>Carles</hi> and base spirited-men which is mostly occasioned by the frequent access of too many that are such who take up <hi>Trafficking</hi> and <hi>Merchandising,</hi> and supplie the roomes of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of these who think themselves too good to Trade.</p>
                     <p>And seeing there is nothing can make a man more properly a <hi>Gentleman</hi> then Vertue and descent from vertuous persons, by Birth and Antiquity joyned with a competent Estate and Living, and good accomplishments of the mind, our <hi>Cities</hi> being furnished with the Off-spring of old Inhabitants well educated and bred, and vertuous in their Callings and Behaviours, might upon good ground be reputed <hi>Gentlemen</hi> as well as many others that without question are held so; seeing that <hi>Merchandiseing</hi> in it self, may be esteemed as consistent with a <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> as Tillage of the Land may be to these <hi>Gentlemen</hi> who labour their own Lands, which doubtless is very commendable in it self and becoming the Greatest Persons: seeing the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of GOD gives this Counsell by a Royall and Princely Hand as the Pen-man, <hi>Prov.</hi> 12.11. <hi>He that tilleth his Land shall be satisfied with bread, but he that followeth vain persons is void of understanding.</hi> The meaning whereof is very plain, preferring Industrie in the most common
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:106993:88"/>
and ordinary Calling to an idle life, under what ever pretence of Gentility, esteeming such in plain termes fools and void of understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> By this our <hi>Cities</hi> and <hi>Towns</hi> would be better furnished of publick Spirits, that would be more tender of the good of the <hi>Common-wealth</hi>; for it is without all doubt, that when the Inhabitants are born and bred in the <hi>Town,</hi> and it may be, descended of severall Generations of <hi>Ancient Citizens,</hi> they will not onely be more ready to lay out their pains and labour for the Credit and good of the <hi>Town,</hi> but will more willingly spend and be spent, yea, lay down their lives if called thereto, then probably can be expected from <hi>New-incomers,</hi> who cannot have that naturall love and respect to the place which others cannot but have. Hence it is reported of the Generous <hi>Romans,</hi> that after the battell at <hi>Cannae,</hi> when almost all ground of hope was lost of preserving <hi>Rome, Florus lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 6. said, <hi>Aerario deficiente pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vati opes suas Reip. conferunt.</hi> That is, <hi>When the Thesaurie was exhausted all the privat men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed their Wealth upon the Publict.</hi>

                     <p>I would have all <hi>Citizens</hi> to consider the way and manner of the most flowrishing <hi>Cities</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, where <hi>Traffick</hi> and all kind of <hi>Trade</hi> is vigorously prosecuted to the great encrease of Wealth and Prosperity, and that by the most

                     <p>Let all therefore consider, if a <hi>Town</hi> or <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth</hi> be under a great decay and heavy burdens, that are like to ruine the same, if surable and seasonable remedies be not provided, whither it be not as needfull for <hi>Citizens</hi> to deny themselves, and give up their private interests to be disposed of for relief of the Publick, as it is for a diseased person that is threatned with death by a deadly disease, to submit to let blood and to purging evacuations, though the potion were never so bitter and unpleasant to the taste, especially if there be hope of health and life thereby. We must not be as Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren who are led meerly by sense, but as Men who by Reason can deny Sense and force themselves to submit to such Medicines as may effectuat the cure, though never so unpleasant to the pallat.</p>
                     <p>It is therefore an unbeseeming thing in any, to grudge at any Impositions that may relieve the Publick Burdens of the <hi>Common-Wealth.</hi> And surely those <hi>Towns</hi> whose Inhabitants vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarly consent to such reliefs, without the Imposition of the <hi>Supream Authority,</hi> are high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be commended, as <hi>Dundee</hi> and <hi>Glasgow,</hi> such cannot but flowrish and prosper, as is to be seen by the considerable acquisitions which the <hi>City</hi> of <hi>Glasgow</hi> hath made within thir few years, yea in building a new <hi>Town</hi> at the mouth
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:106993:90"/>
of their River with all accommodations for <hi>Trade, &amp;c.</hi> I could be glade that all the <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens</hi> in this <hi>Kingdom</hi> would but inform them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves of the publick spiritedness of that People thir many years by gone, and emulat with them; and to give but one instance of this. In the time when the <hi>Englishes</hi> had the Government of this <hi>Nation,</hi> when <hi>Gess</hi> and <hi>Excyse</hi> was great; they of their own accord did agree to pay six <hi>Shillings-sterling</hi> upon every <hi>Boll</hi> of <hi>Malt,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they payed all the publick Dues, and the whole <hi>Sallaries</hi> of their <hi>Stipendiaries</hi>; and had their Publick Revenue of their <hi>Thesaurie</hi> still free from any out-givings all that time, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they shortly after acquyred Lands of great Rents. An <hi>Old-Provest</hi> of that <hi>Town</hi> J.

                     <p>So that it may be said in some respect of them, as <hi>Florus in his second book; Chap.</hi> 6. said of <hi>Rome,</hi> after the <hi>Battell of Cannae. O populum dignum omnium faevore &amp; admiratione ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minum! compulsus ad ultimos metus ab incepto non destitit: &amp; de sua urbe solicitus.</hi> (that is) <hi>O people! worthy of the favour and respect of all men; and of their admiration; though redacted to the last extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity; yet carefull of their Town.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If such a Spirit did act the <hi>Citizens</hi> of our

                        <hi>Nation,</hi> our <hi>Towns</hi> would be in a more pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous condition by far then they are: and in order to this, I will lay before you this consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, either ye are <hi>Citizens</hi> born or not. If ye be <hi>Natives</hi>? it is but naturall to all men to love the place of their Nativity. Many have not thought their Lives dear to them, and to undergo all perills and hazards for the Honour and Well-being thereof, according to that old saying. <hi>Dulce est pro Patria mori. It is gratefull to die for their Native-Countrey.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And they that are not born, but now made <hi>Free-Citizens</hi> may mind that their Children are born there, and Parents for most part tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell and toyl for their Children, and so in freeing the Publick Debts and Burdens, ye free your Posterity of Burdens.</p>
                     <p>But some possibly may jealous the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration of their <hi>Magistrats</hi> as unfaithfull, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To which I can say, (having severall years born Office in our own <hi>Town,</hi>) I never knew any cause for such a thought, nor that ever a <hi>Magistrat</hi> was so base as to be guilty of such a Crime, which the <hi>Romans</hi> called, <hi>Crimen Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culatus</hi>: when <hi>Magistrats</hi> or others took of the Publick Money to make their personall gain, which is to be abhored by GOD and Man, and is enough to procure a Curse upon them and their Posterity, who ever should be guilty of such baseness.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="181" facs="tcp:106993:91"/>
I have read of severall brave Men amongst those we call Heathens, that have been Persons of greatest Trust, who have been so faithfull, that rather then appropriat of the Publick to their privat use, they have preferred to dye poor: so that they have been buried on the Publick Expense, and their Children educated and provyded by the same means. It ought to be far more abhorrent to these that profess Christianity.</p>
                     <p>But because it is frequent with many to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of a dissatisfaction with their <hi>Rulers,</hi> and apprehend their might be had many fitter to Govern then they who are present Incumbents, I suppose if they had their choise, it would fare with them as it did with the People of <hi>Capua,</hi> when they were about to have murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red their whole <hi>Senat,</hi> had not <hi>Clavius Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuvius,</hi> who had great respect amongst the People desired them (being conveened in a Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Assembly) to fall upon the choise of a New <hi>Senat</hi> before they destroyed the Old. There was not a man that any could name, but he was rejected by the multitude for some fault or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or as base and unworthie: wherefore he prevailed with them to spare the <hi>Senators</hi> and to take a new triall of them. I apprehend it would be even so in many <hi>Cities,</hi> where the people are most dissatisfied with their present <hi>Magistrats</hi> are they could agree amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>

Therefore seeing the best of men are but men, let none discover their fathers nakedness, but patiently and charitably bear with human in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, and all concur in their stations, to seek the Wellfare of the Publick.</p>

                     <p>As for Honour, it was the Glory of our <hi>Naion</hi> after long and many bloody conflicts with the <hi>Romans,</hi> to set bounds to the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> that we had matter to say as GOD Himself said to the Sea, <hi>Job</hi> 38.11. <hi>Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further: and here shall thy proud waves be stayed.</hi> Though its our duty to say as <hi>Psal.</hi> 115.1. <hi>Not unto us O LORD, Not unto us, but unto thy Name give Glory.</hi> For

though this was the LORDS mercie, yet he made use of the valour and conduct of that renowned King <hi>Corbredus,</hi> surnamed <hi>Galdus,</hi> the <hi>twentyfirst</hi> King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the courage and valiant indefatigability of your noble An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors, so that the <hi>Roman-Armie</hi> consisting of above ten Legions, or sixty thousand men, when they first came under the Command of <hi>Julius Agricola,</hi> they were so beaten and worn out by the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Pights,</hi> that they came to twenty thousand, who came to be so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaguered within their trenches, and brought to that straite, that they sent their Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors to our King who commanded in Chief, which because it may be looked upon as a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Glory (in the Vulgar esteem) then any other <hi>Kingdom</hi> in <hi>Europe</hi> can boast of: I have thought fit to insert their address and speach here, as not unworthy of record which is as followeth.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>There are</hi> (sayes he) <hi>two remarkable faults, which oftentimes men of sharpest spirits fall into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Government of Societies, &amp;c. One is, that they look narrowly to the inconvenients of a Law, or of a good motion, without considering the good that may flow from it.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>The other is, they run from one extream to another.</hi> So I shall wish the Benefits which may flow from this, may be laid in the ballance against any inconvenients which men can imagin can fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low upon this.</p>
                     <p>Next, I wish such may not run from the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent

and carefull observation of such good Overtures and profitable Motions, to a supine and totall neglect of all that may tend to the Glory of GOD, good of the <hi>Countrey,</hi> and of their Posterity: but rather (as I hinted in the beginning) may improve their accutest Parts, and more noble Enduements, to fall u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon a way of prosecuting these Honorable Ends <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>In the beginning of the late Troubles, it was able to set forth Eight hundred men in good array and Military Furniture to the Fields, well trained for service when called thereto.</p>
                     <p>It being seated between the Rivers of <hi>Dee</hi> and <hi>Don,</hi> is said by <hi>George Buchannan,</hi> our <hi>Scots-His<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriographer,</hi> to be <hi>piscatu Salmonum nobilis,</hi> that is, <hi>Excellent, or Famous for Salmond-Fishing.</hi>

                     <p>This <hi>City</hi> was Erected into a <hi>Burgh-Royall</hi> by <hi>Gregorius,</hi> who for his Justice, Temperance and Fortitude, was surnamed <hi>the Great,</hi> and was the 73. <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi>; whose Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <hi>Acts,</hi> both in <hi>Scotland, England</hi> and <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> are at length set down in <hi>Hector Boyes His<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,</hi> and in <hi>Buchannans</hi> in the year after the birth of CHRIST 893 years.

                     <p>But it pleased GOD he dyed at <hi>Wooller</hi> on the <hi>Border</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> in his return home.

                     <p>In the year 1649, when the <hi>Parliament</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> out of their dutifull Respects, and Loyaltie to their undoubted <hi>Soveraign, King
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:106993:121"/>
CHARLES</hi> the <hi>second,</hi> had proclaimed Him <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Great Britain, France</hi> and <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and immediatly did choose <hi>Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi> of all the three <hi>Estates</hi> of this <hi>Kingdom,</hi> to invite their <hi>King</hi> to this his <hi>Ancient King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> to receive the <hi>Crown</hi> which had now of right descended to him from 108 <hi>Kings.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Parliament</hi> made choise of ALEXAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DER JAFFRAY of <hi>Kingswells Commissioner</hi> for <hi>Aberdeen,</hi> to be one of the two <hi>Burrowes</hi> to go over to <hi>Holland</hi> to the <hi>King,</hi> who was a Wise, Pious and Discreet Man all his time. And he (to be faithfull to the <hi>City</hi> he had his <hi>Commission</hi> from) intreated the <hi>Parliament</hi> to consider the most important <hi>Article</hi> in his <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,</hi> that so he might undertake that weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Employment with the greater Alacrity, which was to visit the counts of the extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary losses of <hi>Aberdeen</hi> relating to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick. The <hi>Parliament</hi> had that respect to him, and was so desirous to grant his so just de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, that forthwith they did Deput some fit Members, who after hearing and considering, made their report, and thereupon the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi> by an <hi>Act</hi> did acknowledge themselves, (as the Representative of the <hi>Nation</hi>) to be justly resting to the <hi>City</hi> of <hi>Aberdeen</hi> the summ of nine hundreth threescore and nine thousand Merks, and did grant the <hi>Cess</hi> of the <hi>City</hi> to be allowed to them for as many Moneths as
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:106993:122"/>
drew to eighteen thousand Merks; because this great summ that was due to them had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hausted the summs of Money that was Mortified to <hi>Hospitals Schools,</hi> the <hi>Colledge,</hi> and the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Poor</hi> of that <hi>City</hi>; and had ruined almost the Common <hi>Thesaurie</hi> thereof; but this was all they could spare at that time, till an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity might fall out to make them more full payment, which hitherto hath ever failed, and hath been the cause of the severall heavy bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>densom <hi>Taxations</hi> that have of late years been laid on, and of procuring that relief which hath been obtained thir five or six years by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone by the <hi>Magistrats,</hi> who withall have made themselves lyable to the grudge of such as are so selfiish, that before their particular suffer but a little, they could let the Publick come to utter ruine and perish without remedy and unavoidably: but of two evils the least is to be chosen.</p>
                     <p>But to return, Our abovenamed <hi>Commissioner</hi> obtained also an <hi>Act of Parliament,</hi> that no Souldiers should be quartered in <hi>Aberdeen</hi> for three years thereafter, such was the great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect the <hi>Parliament</hi> had to him, whereupon he went to the <hi>King</hi> with the rest of the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners</hi> of the three <hi>Estates.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And after his return, being <hi>Commissioner</hi> to the <hi>Convention of Burrowes</hi> at <hi>Queensferrie,</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained half a merk down of <hi>Aberdeens</hi> propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

of the 100 <hi>Pound</hi> of <hi>Stent-Roll,</hi> which was a great advantage to the <hi>City.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He being chosen that year <hi>Provest</hi> of <hi>Aber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deen,</hi> went with the rest of the <hi>Commissioners</hi> the next year 1650 to the <hi>Hague</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi> where it pleased GOD so to prosper their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, as to bring the <hi>King</hi> home with them. <hi>Aberdeen</hi> being the first <hi>City</hi> of the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> he came to, there he was received with all the Demonstrations of joy and cheerfullness that the <hi>Magistrats</hi> and <hi>Inhabitants</hi> could evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: as also, the <hi>Silver-Keyes</hi> of the <hi>City</hi> were delivered to him by the <hi>Provest</hi> (who tame sometime before to prepare for the <hi>Kings,</hi> reception) with an Eloquent and Pertinent <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangue</hi> therewith made by <hi>Mr. James Sandilands,</hi> of <hi>Cotton,</hi> the <hi>Cities Recorder,</hi> or <hi>Clerk.</hi>
