            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Think I should be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to my self at this time, in my own neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary Vindication, should I forbear any longer, to give my Friends a True Account of my Behaviour in the late Ecclesiastical
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:41217:4"/>
Commission. Though I profess, what I shall now say, I only intend as a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable Mitigation of the Offence I have given, not entirely to Justifie my Sitting in that Court; for which, I acknowledge, I have deservedly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr'd the Censure of many Good Men: And I wish I may ever be able to make a sufficient Amends to my Country for it.</p>
            <p>Yet thus much, <hi>My Lord,</hi> I can justly alledge for my self, That the Commission was made, and my Name put into it, altogether without my Knowledge; when I hapen'd to be at <hi>Salisbury,</hi> holding an Archiepiscopal Visitation with the Bishop of <hi>Chiche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi> and other Commissioners: Where, by God's Blessing, we composed se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral old Differences and Animosities, and restored Peace and Unity to that Church.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:41217:4"/>At my return from thence to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> I found I was appointed to be one in a New Commission: But I could never see a Copy of it, nor did I ever hear its Contents, or know the Powers granted in it, till the time of its being publicly open'd at <hi>Whitehal</hi>; whither I was sent for, on purpose, in haste, that very Morning, from my House in the Country; being just come home from a Confirmation, and from paying my Duty to Her <hi>Royal High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> the Princess of <hi>Denmark</hi> at <hi>Tun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon the first publishing the Commission, I confess, through my Ignorance in the Laws, I had little or no Objection in my Thoughts against the Legality of it; especially when I confider'd, That having past the Broad Seal, it must needs, according to my
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:41217:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
apprehension, have been examin'd and approved by the King's Learned Council in the Law, Men generally esteemed of eminent Skill in their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession. Besides, I was farther con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd (though too rashly I grant) in my Error, when I saw two Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the Long Robe, Persons of the greatest Place and Authority in <hi>Westminster-Hall,</hi> joyned with us; who, I should have thought, would never have ventur'd their Fortunes and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations, by exercising a Jurisdiction that was Illegal.</p>
            <p>And I believ'd I had Reason to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, That this very Argument might prevail also with some others of the Temporal Lords, that sate among us. Particularly the Earl of <hi>Rochester</hi> has often assur'd me, 'twas that which induc'd him to accept of the Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion;
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:41217:5"/>
and that he did it, as I my self did, with a purpose of doing as much Good as we were able, and of hindring as much Evil, as we possibly could, in that Unfortunate Juncture of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs.</p>
            <p>As for my own Part, I was startled when I perceived my Lord of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> scrupled to be present with us; whose Example, 'tis true, I ought ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to have followed than the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Lawyers in all Matters of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Yet I hope his Grace will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse me, if I declare, that I did not at first know He made a Matter of Conscience of it. Nor did I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand his Grace took Exception at the Lawfulness of the Commission it self, till after my Lord of <hi>London</hi> was Cited, and had Appear'd, and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd, and the unjust Sentence was past against him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:41217:6"/>
For it was on the very Day the Commission was open'd, immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as I remember, after it was read, that my Lord of <hi>London</hi> was inform'd against, for not Suspending Dr. <hi>Sharp:</hi> Which, though it exceedingly sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd me at first, yet observing with what heat the Prosecution was like to be carryed on against him, that very Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration did the more incline me to Sit and Act there, that I might be in some Capacity of doing Right to his Lordship. And whether I did him any Service through the whole Process of his Cause, I leave it to my Lord himself to judge. That I gave my Positive Vote for his Acquittal, Both the Times when his Suspension came in question, I suppose I need not tell the World.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:41217:6"/>
Having thus, in the beginning of that Court, and the highest Ferment of it, freely discharg'd my Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, by Endeavouring to clear my Lord of <hi>London,</hi> I must own, I thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth unawares took a Resolution, which, how hurtful soever it may now prove to my self, yet I am still apt to believe, did the Church of <hi>England</hi> no Disservice in the Main. My De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, by continuing longer among them, was to make sure of one Vote at least, and to do my Part, to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most of my small Interest and Ability, to lessen the Blow which I fear'd was coming on the Clergy, since it could not altogether be avoided.</p>
            <p>And I was the more persuaded to take this Course, not only because the Legality or Illegality of the Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion seem'd at first rather a Moot-case,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:41217:7"/>
than a determin'd Point either way; divers of the Principal Lawyers, as I was told, being divided in their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions concerning it; but also because I saw, some other Persons were ready to fill my Chair there, as soon as it should be empty; Men of whose Principles and Practices I was so well aware, that I knew they wou<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d not have the same regard as my self for the Churches Preservation. And perhaps I might add this further for the Exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation of my Fault, That I was not discouraged by some Grave and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Persons, for this very purpose, to keep in some longer time: But I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to name them, that I may not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve any Good Man in my Infelicity.</p>
            <p>However, upon these Motives I Acted, and, in pursuance of this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, God knows, I Voted, as long as
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:41217:7"/>
I remained at the Board: Where all my Opinions were so contrary to the Humour of the Court, that I often thought my self to be really in as much Hazard from the Commission it self, by my not Complying, as any of my Brethren could be, that were out of it.</p>
            <p>I Appeal to all that were acquainted with the Transactions there, whether ever I gave my Consent to any Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular or Arbitrary Sentence; whether I did not constantly and firmly Declare against every Extravagant Decree. I could almost presume to affirm, That I was, as far as in me lay, some way or other, a Common Sollicitor, or Advocate for all that were unjustly Prosecuted before them. And I might exemplifie this beyond all Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, if I should enumerate every
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:41217:8"/>
particular Cause, that came under their Cognizance.</p>
            <p>After my Lord of <hi>London</hi> was Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced, his Lordship knows, <hi>I</hi> was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways upon the Watch to obstruct all farther Proceedings against him. Nay, his Lordship well remembers, <hi>I</hi> had once obtained to have his Suspension taken off, if he would but have made an ordinary Submission.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>I</hi> was Zealous for <hi>Exeter-College,</hi> in their Defence against Father <hi>Petre,</hi> in a Business of so great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, that if the College had been overcome in the Suit, that whole So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety must soon have been abandoned to Popery.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> did my utmost to oppose the Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Persecution upon the whole Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity of <hi>Cambridge</hi>; when the Vice-Chancellor was suspended his Office,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:41217:8"/>
and his Mastership of <hi>Magdalen-College,</hi> because a Popish Priest, who was one of the Missionaries to pervert the Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, was denied a Degree in their Convocation.</p>
            <p>I faithfully Assisted and Served <hi>Christ-Church</hi> in <hi>Oxford,</hi> when they were in danger of having new Statutes Imposed upon them, which would In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly have laid open that Royal Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, to the Ruine of their Good Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Religion.</p>
            <p>I absolutely resisted all the Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the Statutes of <hi>Sidney-College,</hi> and all other Changes and Abrogati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Oaths, that were then made or designed in the Statutes of either University, for the advantage of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Priests and Students, and for the freer course of <hi>Mandamus</hi>'s in their Favour.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:41217:9"/>
I ever gave my Advice for all sorts of Business, to be return'd into the common course of Justice; as that all Ecclesiastical Matters should be refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red back to the several Bishops from whose Dioceses the Complaints were brought; and that all Informations against Colleges and Hospitals should be recommitted to their proper Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors.</p>
            <p>I persisted unmoveable in my Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent from every Vote that passed against <hi>Magdalen-College</hi> in <hi>Oxford;</hi> from their very first Citation before that Court, to the cruel incapacitating of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident and Fellows.</p>
            <p>I could mention many other Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, wherein I successfully labour'd to relieve divers of the inferior and greater Clergy from Oppression; to prevent some from being call'd before
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:41217:9"/>
us at all; to preserve others after they were accused by malicious Sycophants and Informers, that swarm'd then every where: Some in the Case of Tythes; some for pressing Churchwardens to take Legal Oaths; some for not Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, some for Preaching against the King's Declaration.</p>
            <p>But there are Two Eminent Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which I cannot omit. The one, That when the Bishop of <hi>Lincoln</hi> was Petition'd against by his Arch-Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con, and there was, at that time, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination enough in the Court to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue him to Extremity, yet my Lord Bishop of <hi>Peterburgh,</hi> by interceding for him with the King, and I with the Commissioners, so effectually wrought, that the Prosecution against him was discountenanced and fell to the Ground.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:41217:10"/>
The other Instance concerns my Lord of <hi>Canterbury</hi>; and I am confident his Grace will readily give me this Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, That I served him honestly and industriously on some Occasions, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he was like to be embroiled with the Commission; which must inevitably have ended in his Grace's Suspension at least, since he was resolved, whenever he should be brought before them, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Pretence had been, to deny the whole Power and Jurisdiction of the Court.</p>
            <p>As for the last Scene transacted there, which was in Order to Censure the whole Clergy, for refusing to Read the Declaration: In that I hope I need say nothing in my Defence, it being pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licly known to the whole Nation, how I then demean'd my self; how I broke loose from the Commission in a time,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:41217:10"/>
when I was convinced I could do the Church no farther Service there, and when the Popish Party was in the height of their Power and Rage. Then it was that I joyned my self again to the Common In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest of the honest Clergy, just when they were on the very Brink of Destruction, before we ever dream'd of this Glorious Deliverance.</p>
            <p>This is certain, that my leaving and defying the Commission at that time, did apparently exasperate the Popish Priests, and the Ring-leaders of the Jesuitical Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction against me, to the highest Degree imaginable. Nay, some Worthy Men have made me almost so vain as to fancy, that my bidding the Commission then Farewel in so public and peremptory a Manner, was no inconsiderable Stroke to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Dissolution of the Commission it self. It is evident, that immediately up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the receit of my Letter, wherein I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd

them, they Adjourned in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion for Six Months, and scarce ever met afterwards.</p>
            <p>Thus far I am sure, my perpetual Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour therein, was so much all of a piece, so directly against the Vogue of the Court, and the Counsels of Popery then prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and the Effects of it did so visibly destroy my former Interest with the King, that whereas it is manifest, I was, when the Commission began, in as fair a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability as any Clergy-Man in <hi>England,</hi> to receive great Effects of His Majesties Favour; yet after my Opposing my Lord Bishop of <hi>London</hi>'s Suspension, and my other Votes Conformable to that, I fell by Degrees under His severe Displeasure.</p>
            <p>I might add moreover, that it is very probable, I was at last in more imminent Danger than any of my Brethren; I say, my Lord, than any of my Brethren, the Seven Petitioning Bishops, and my Lord

of <hi>London</hi> only excepted; whose Merits and Sufferings, in Asserting our Laws and Religion, were so conspicuous, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence the Fury of the Papists against them so implacable, that perhaps it would be Presumption in any other Clergy-Man, much more in Me, to come in Competition with Them for either of those Honours.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole Matter therefore, tho' as to the Legal Part of the Commission, which belong'd to Lawyers to judge of, I was mistaken, for Acting in it at all: Yet in the Conscientious Part, which properly concern'd me as a Divine, to Act in it honestly and sincerely, according to the best of my Judgment, in that, if I shall not be thought to deserve Thanks, yet I hope I may obtain Pardon from all Men of Candor and Ingenuity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lord,</hi> I know your Lordship's Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerosity and Tender Concern for your

Friends, whereof I have had so much Experience, will excuse me for troubling you with this my long Confession and Apology, for my share in the Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical Commission. I wholly submit it to your Lordship's Prudence and Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, to make what use of it you please in my behalf. Only, this I will say, That if I had as good a Cause for you to Plead, as I have in your Lordship a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron to Defend me, I should not have an Enemy in all <hi>England.</hi>
