            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

very <hi>little</hi> reaſon to believe <hi>much</hi> in it. The man
ſpeaks of what may be, and not of what uſually is. He hath
fancyes, notions and dreams of Innocent Incloſure both from
Depopulation and Decay of Tillage. And for the Townes
he names to be free, they are groſly guilty either of the one,
or of the other, or of both.</p>
            <p>

making of hedges and ditches, is not a ſinne, but
ſuch incloſure that is deſtructive to Publique, and Poore is a

maintaine their Country by, or of places neer the ſea or Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
but of incloſure in the Inland Countreys, which takes
away Tillage, the onely Trade generall they have to live on;

            <p>Firſt then, what is meant by <hi>three tranſgreſſions, and for four?</hi>
In plain tearms is meant, adding of ſinne to ſinne, <hi>Iſa. 30. 1.</hi>

that is saith he, for very many. A finite number is put for an
indefinite. And then God ſeemed to ſpeak thus, If <hi>Iſrael</hi> had
had a moderation in ſinning, I would have turoed away their
puniſhment, I would have been moderate in puniſhing; but
ſince to three ſinnes they have added four, and to many they
daily adde more, I am determined to perfect my judgements
upon them, and to be avenged on them once for all.</p>

            <p>Laſtly, we may expound for <hi>three tranſgreſſions, and for four;</hi>
by the <hi>twelfth verſe of this Chapter.</hi> Whereas here he complains
of <hi>three tranſgreſſions, and foure;</hi> ſo there he complains, <hi>I am
preſſed under you as a cart is preſſed with ſheaves:</hi> Now this is a
plain Countrey-compariſon: When we load a cart, we begin
with a few ſheaves at the firſt, with two, or three, or four;
and ſo goe on to lay on more ſheaves one after another, till
we over-load, and are ready to preſſe the cart into pieces. So
<hi>Iſrael</hi> layd on one ſheaf after another, one ſinne after another,
ſtill burthening God with their ſinnes, that he ſeems to groan
under the burthen of them, as one that is weary to bear them
any longer. <hi>Iſaiah 1. 24. they make him ſigh. Ab, I will eaſe me

is, for the gain and profit, uſe them they doe as they uſe their
beaſts, keep them or put them off for their advantage. So long
as ſerviceable, drudge them, rack their rents, buy them to get by
them, and then ſell them; yea, away with them out of houſe
and harbour, town and field, take away their calling, and lively<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
that ſhould maintain themſelves, wives, and children, &amp;c.
When leſſer gain comes in by them; They ſell them or buy
them upon that account as may ſerve their turns <hi>(Judas-like)</hi>
to fill the bagge, and make no more account of them than a
payre of ſhooes, yea old ſhooes that they caſt to the dunghill.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>That pant after the duſt of the earth,</hi>

                  <hi>Vid.</hi> The clear-ſpirited Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitor upon holy Writ Mr. <hi>Caryll</hi> upon <hi>Job,</hi> c. 24. ver. 3.</note> That is, (ſaith Mr. <hi>Caryll</hi>)
exceedingly deſire and long for it. As <hi>David</hi> deſcribes his holy
deſires, <hi>Pſal. 42. 1. As the Hart panteth after the water-brooks,
ſo panteth my ſoul after thee O God:</hi> that is, I extremely deſire
thy preſence and communion with thee: even as the Hart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
hunted and heated deſireth the waters. Thus they panted
after the duſt of the earth, that is, after thoſe things which are
but as the duſt of the earth, or whoſe originall and matter is
but the duſt of the earth, gold, of ſilver. Theſe are but the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
duſt of the earth. But whoſe duſt did they pant after? It
was the duſt upon the <hi>head of the poor.</hi> If they did but ſee a poor
man to have gotten a little about him, though onely enough to
keep life and ſoule together, to preſerve himſelf and his family
from ſtarving, or begging, they preſently panted after it: they
were paſſionately deſirous of it: they caſt about how to get it.
They who are inflamed with covetouſneſſe are buſie <hi>to finde out,</hi>
and having found out, are greedy <hi>to purſue</hi> all advantages and
occaſions to enrich themſelves though it be with the ruine of
the poor. They are glad to get ſomething even from them, who
(according to common ſpeech) have nothing. They ſcrap't from
them who have but ſcraps to live on. Thus ſweetly hath that
heavenly man interpreted theſe words to our hand.</p>
            <q>And turn aſide the way of the meek.</q>
            <p>That is, <hi>firſt</hi> they turn aſide the way of <hi>Juſtice and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:59568:7"/>
which is the means of recovering their right. They can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
have that juſtice and right <hi>done</hi> them, which is <hi>due</hi> unto
them. By reaſon of the greatneſſe of the eſtates and power of
theſe men, they ſtop the current of juſtice and equity, whereby
theſe meek ones ſhould be delivered from their oppreſſours.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> they turn aſide the way of the meek, that is, they
take away the way of their <hi>livelyhood.</hi> We uſe commonly to
aske this Queſtion, How doth ſuch a man live? And 'tis an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
He lives in a very good way, he hath ſuch a way of
living, ſuch a trade, calling, or profeſſion, that's his way. Thus
to turn aſide the way of the meek, is to put them beſides the
way of getting their bread, and maintaining themſelves, wives,
and children with neceſſary proviſions.</p>
            <p>To take away the calling they live by, is a turning aſide the
way of the meek to all purpoſes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> they turn aſide the way of the meek. Why? what
is the way of the meek? The Pſalmiſt tells us, <hi>Pſal. 25. 9.</hi> it is
Gods way, the meek he will teach his way. Now theſe great
ones either <hi>firſt</hi> force them to make ſhipwrack of faith and a
good conſcience, or <hi>elſe</hi> undoe them if they will not conſent
unto them in their unjuſt and uncharitable deſignes. And ſo of
neceſſity theſe meek ones muſt be <hi>undone</hi> either <hi>in the inward,
or outward man.</hi> Or elſe <hi>ſecondly,</hi> they become tempters unto
theſe meek ones by their often alluring perſwaſions and ill eg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging,
or elſe by their ill examples to turn them out of Gods
way.</p>
            <p>Thus having explained the Text, I come to ſhew, That <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
(eſpecially <hi>Leiceſter-ſhire,</hi> and the Counties adjacent) is
as guilty of the ſinnes in the Text <hi>now,</hi> as <hi>Iſrael</hi> was <hi>then:</hi> yea,
eſpecially in that <hi>aggregated</hi> ſinne of <hi>Incloſure,</hi> viz: <hi>ſuch as doth
un-people Towns, and un-corn Fields,</hi> which I chiefly intend in
this preſent <hi>diſcourſe.</hi> And that principally, becauſe there are
ſo many ready to make Helmets to ſave this great <hi>Goliah</hi> ſinne,
<hi>harmleſſe;</hi> making this great ſinne a little ſinne, and ſo at laſt
no ſinne at all. For indeed, <hi>all the workmen of this occupation riſe
up together, crying, Great is the Diana of Incloſure, becauſe by
this craft we have our wealth, Acts 19. 25.</hi> And therefore to
defend it they <hi>prate</hi> much, and <hi>print</hi> ſomething: yet I never
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:59568:7"/>
heard of any ſo <hi>audaciouſly impious</hi> as to <hi>preach</hi> the lawfulneſſe
of ſuch Incloſure. But I ſhall ſhew that this Incloſure is not a
ſingle ſinne, but will admit for the aggravation of it all thoſe
ſinnes, and <hi>black circumstances</hi> in the Text: And then we may
conclude, it is a tranſgreſſion for which the Lord will not turn
away the puniſhment thereof. Now then it is my buſineſſe to
<hi>rip</hi> up ſuch Incloſure, and to manifeſt how many ſins lye within
the <hi>bowells of this monſter,</hi> &amp;c. And for the proof I ſhall bring
herein, it is undeniable. Such incloſure ſhall be diſcovered by
his <hi>bloody hands,</hi> and in the very <hi>Fact be found guilty.</hi> If the
<hi>Lord PROTECTOR his Highneſſe; and moſt Honourable
Councel ſhould impannel a Jury of all the honeſt hearts in</hi> Leiceſter-ſhire,
<hi>and</hi> North-hampton-ſhire, <hi>and Counties adjacent, they
muſt bring therein a Verdict againſt ſuch Incloſure, guilty of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>population
and decay of Tillage</hi> generally, very few if any at all
excepted. Our proof is <hi>De Facto: it is ſo.</hi> Behold it with your
eyes. Oh wofull <hi>experience!</hi> And that Incloſure is <hi>now</hi> about
in <hi>Leiceſter-ſhire</hi> is like to be as ſordid and baſe as any of the
former, if not worſe: for, Depopulation comes by degrees; in
the next generation, if not preſent. Behold what deſolation of
houſes and tillage of Farmers, Cottagers, Men-ſervants, Mayd-ſervants,
&amp;c. which all lived by the Plow.</p>
            <p>But I haſten for the Conviction of ſuch Incloſure to be guilty
as aſoreſaid. And for ſuch conviction I ſhall follow the method
of the Text, as thoſe ſinnes lye in order there:</p>
            <q>For three Tranſgreſſions of Iſrael and for four, I will not
turn away the puniſhment thereof.</q>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> It cannot be denyed that if ſuch as make ſuch Incloſure
be guilty of all the ſinnes in the Text, then they are guilty of
three tranſgreſſions and of foure, (that is, as hath been opened)
they adde ſinne to ſinne, they accumulate very many ſinnes,
they commit a multitude of ſinnes: To three ſinnes they adde
foure, they preſſe God as a cart is preſſed with ſheaves, <hi>Amos</hi>
2 12. laying on one ſheafe after another, burthening God with
their ſinnes, and make him ſerve with their ſinnes. But the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
is true, Therefore they are guilty of three tranſgreſſions
and of four. We ſhall prove the former true in the enſuing par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
of the Text.</p>
            <q>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:59568:8"/>They ſold the righteous for ſilver.</q>
            <p>That is, if we put to this <hi>ſelling</hi> of the righteous for ſilver, the
<hi>buying</hi> of the poore for ſilver, <hi>Amos 8. 6.</hi> they make chaffer and
merchandize of them for gain and profit: they uſe them as they
doe their beaſts, <hi>keep</hi> them or <hi>put</hi> them off for advantage: they
buy them, and ſell them, as may beſt ſerve their turns to get by
them. But what is that they thus buy and ſell the righteous for?
<hi>For ſilver,</hi> that is, for advantage, profit, gain. <hi>Oh baſe!</hi> And
then why ſuch Incloſure made I pray you? Is it not for ſilver,
advantage, gain? Doth not ſilver, filthy lucre lye at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome?
Doe they not call ſuch Incloſure an <hi>Improvement</hi> of their
lands? We ſhall <hi>gaine by it,</hi> we ſhall <hi>treble</hi> our rents. Hence
thoſe <hi>Heatheniſh</hi> ſpeeches of theirs. <hi>May I not make the beſt of
mine own? May I not doe what I list with mine own? Who ſhall

hath given thee all things richly to enjoy,</hi> hath layd a <hi>charge</hi> upon

build on for eternall life, who walk contrary to this charge? &amp;c.
What, mayeſt thou doe with thine own what thou liſteſt, and
improve it to thine own advantage? No: hear that complaint,
<hi>Phil. 2. 21. All ſeek their own, not the things that are Jeſus Chriſts.</hi>
I tell thee Jeſus Chriſt muſt ſhare with thee in land, houſe,

alſo, <hi>Phil. 2. 4. Look not every man on his own things, but every
man alſo on the things of others,</hi> even that they may thrive as thy
ſelf. But yet I have not touched this ſin in this particular to the
<hi>quick.</hi> Thou muſt then ask this Queſtion, may I not <hi>improve mine

<hi>ſtartle,</hi> and ſay, <hi>Whoſe hurt? Whoſe damage?</hi> I will make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
thou <hi>raiſeſt</hi> thy own eſtate upon the <hi>ruine both of Publick &amp;
Poor.</hi> Firſt, on the ruine of the <hi>Publicke, Thou takest away Til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage,
which is the generall Trade we live on in</hi> Leiceſter-ſhire, <hi>and
the Counties adjacent:</hi> By which <hi>Trade or Tillage</hi> and <hi>Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry</hi>
we have been as <hi>beneficiall</hi> to the reſt of the <hi>Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
of England</hi> as any Countyes whatſoever. We have fed
them not onely with our wheat, corn, and mault, not onely in
plentifull years, but alſo in times of famine and dearth, we being
the onely magazine for corn in the middle of the Nation; But
alſo we have fed them with fat mutton, and ſwines fleſh, yea
alſo with victualling our ſhips by our peaſe and beans that come
by the plow. As our open-fields breed abundance of ſheep, ſo
the plow provides abundance of the aforeſaid proviſions to
feed them fat; yea, at ſuch times when no fat fleſh is to be had
elſewhere in the Nation. <hi>If the Tillage of theſe inland Countyes
be turned into grazing, the reſt of the Nation muſt be in a ſtarving
condition whenſoever the Lord ſhall ſlack his hand of this abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of corn,</hi> he ſeems of late years to have rained from heaven
amongſt us. Thus are we as <hi>beneficiall</hi> by our <hi>Trade of Tillage
to other Countyes,</hi> as they to us by other <hi>Manufactures</hi> which
are ſo commodious, they lying neer to the Sea and City which
we are ſo farre from.</p>
            <p>Yea, to ſhew the Intolerableneſſe of ſuch Incloſure: Behold
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:59568:9"/>
it takes away the <hi>general Trade</hi> that all the Inhabitants of theſe
Counties live on, except ſome great ones and Tradeſ-men in
Market-Towns, &amp;c. Can any deny but that the Farmer lives
of the <hi>plow,</hi> the Cottagers live of the <hi>plow,</hi> and the Children
of both brought up to the trade of the <hi>plow,</hi> and doe not the
Children of the poor become Men-ſervants and Mayd-ſervants
to the <hi>Plow-man?</hi> Doth not that <hi>antient, honeſt, venerable, and
profitable Trade of Husbandry maintain all theſe?</hi> Yea, and all
theſe lived as happily, plentifully, and richly of this <hi>Trade of
Tillage in theſe Countyes</hi> before ſo much <hi>Incloſure,</hi> as any in
other Countyes whatſoever, or of what other Trade ſoever
they were of. What muſt become of theſe <hi>thouſands and ten
thouſands</hi> if ſuch Incloſure be not ſpeedily ſtopped? As every
honeſt heart prayes GOD SPEED THE PLOW, ſo every
every <hi>good Miniſter</hi> will have a word to uphold it, and every

               </gap>o ſave it from ruine.
What now, mayeſt thou doe what what liſteſt with thine owne,
and advance thine own neſt on high thus upon the ruine of the
Publique? Why art thou not content with thine own? ſince
eſpecially thy lands in Common are worth as much and more
than ever thy fore-fathers purchaſed them at, or thou of late
haſt purchaſed thine at. If they that ſold thy lands in Common
had had thy evil conſcience to have improved them upon the
ruines of the Publique and Poor, thou and thy Fore-fathers
muſt have paid twice as much, if not thrice as much more for
them. But now theſe covetous wretches have got the <hi>trick</hi> of
it to buy lands in Common, and preſently improve them, and
ſo double if not treble their money upon a <hi>Publick account.</hi>
Theſe cruell ones care not how many they ruine ſo they may be
rich, nor how many they make Beggars ſo they may be Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;
Let them anſwer me this one Queſtion, viz: How ſo
<hi>many thouſand Families</hi> can ſubſiſt, when their <hi>Livelyhood</hi> is
taken away, to wit, their <hi>Trade of Tillage?</hi> And how ſhall ſo
many <hi>thouſands</hi> of Children be diſpoſed of from ſtarving, Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grancy
or thieving, ſince ſo much Incloſure hath cauſed ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Tradeſmen already they cannot live one by another?</p>
            <p>But it will be objected, ſome Books have been printed of late
that prove Incloſure both lawfull and laudable. Surely my
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:59568:9"/>
heart bleeds within me to ſee ſome hands at ſuch Books of
whom I hoped better things, That they ſhould daub ore this
black ſinne with ſuch untempered morter. Oh how men will
ſcrabble for gain! They would not have <hi>a spade called a ſpade.</hi>
They would not (though they are ſuch) be called oppreſſours,
unjuſt, unconſcionable, uncharitable, unmercifull. And ſurely
ſuch Books are ſtuffed ſo full of <hi>levity and untruths,</hi> that the
Authors of them deſerve rather to be <hi>pitied</hi> than <hi>anſwered.</hi> I
but theſe Books ſay there may be an innocent Incloſure. What
then? <hi>The Petitioner: to Parliament formerly, and the Petitioners
now to his Highneſſe and Councell ſeek a redreſſe againſt ſuch In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſure
that doth depopulate Townes and decay Tillage.</hi> And ſuch
the authors of theſe books hold to be hatefull to God and man.
Yes, but they ſay there may be an incloſure without decay of
Tillage or Depopulation. Surely they may make men as ſoon
believe there is no ſun in the firmament as that uſually depopu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
&amp; decay of Tillage will not follow incloſure in our Inland
Countyes. We ſee it with our eyes: It is ſo. <hi>De facto,</hi> it is ſo.
And we ſee the incloſure that they are ſo now about will be as
ſordid or more then any formerly. They having not ſo much
as one Covenant amongſt them to <hi>uphold Tillage.</hi> And then we
know what followes in his time, even an utter depopulation. It
matters not what they pretend in their books, proviſion for the
poore, &amp;c. In one place they ſpeake of <hi>fourteene acres</hi> given to
the poore, what will this doe when they have taken away their
whole trade of maintenance for themſelves and familyes? Yet
but they ſay they doe not intend depopulation and decay of Til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage.
If in charity I could believe them, Yet I muſt anſwer, it
is <hi>finis operis,</hi> though not <hi>operantis:</hi> It is the end of the <hi>worke,</hi>
though not of the <hi>work-man,</hi> as every where appeares. It is true
indeed, <hi>Infant incloſure</hi> may be ſomewhat in his <hi>nonage free from
depopulation, but never from decay of Tillage.</hi> Yet I know not
where <hi>gray-headed incloſure</hi> is free from depopulation as well as
decay of Tillage. If any where it is rare indeed. For they would
never incloſe to keep Farmers, Tenants, Cottagers, Servants,
teames &amp;c. Yea, but the books tell of ſome townes free from
both Depopulation and decay of Tillage. They ſcrabble up a
few townes that are innocent (as they ſay) which are juſt none
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:59568:10"/>
at all in compariſon of thoſe many hundreds are guilty of both.
And theſe few they are forced to fiſh out of the County of <hi>Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter,
Warwicke, Northampton,</hi> &amp;c. Let's ſee what truth is in
this. For I know two or three of theſe places, becauſe they are
neer unto me. They bragge of the innocency of <hi>Aſhby magna,</hi>
which hath been incloſed above fifty yeares. The truth of this
buſineſſe ſtands thus, The Lord of that place gave moſt of his
Tenants Leaſes for three Lives, and one and twenty years after,
which are not yet expired. And therefore the time of depopula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of that Towne is not yet come. But they name <hi>Miſterton</hi>
and <hi>Poultney</hi> as innocent alſo. I wonder they dare doe ſo, ſince
in regard of depopulation there is no houſe at all leſt in either
of them but the Miniſters. And the Cloſes now are called by
the Towns name that were antiently there. And as for decay of
Tillage in thoſe places they have not been plowed in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
of man, except ſome part of them of late: And the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
that rent them muſt plow them now but for Four years
onely. How dare they print ſuch Falſhoods? And as little cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
I heare and believe is to be given to the innocency of the reſt
of the Townes named.</p>
            <p>I have one word to ſpeak to men that have not put off <hi>huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi>
naturall compaſſion towards their own fleſh, and to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
that love much, becauſe God hath forgiven them much.
Which is this. If you did but hear what complaining and lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
is made of Farmers that rented land turned out of thoſe
Incloſed places, and of poor Cottagers together with them,
that the one cannot get no not at any exceſſive rate a little
land to plow, whereby he might keep his teame and cattell, that
himſelf and family might be employed in husbandry, to get a
poor living by, but is conſtrained to ſell all theſe to all their
utter undoings: That the other cannot get a houſe any where
to harbour himſelfe and his poore babes.</p>
            <p>Surely, it would make <hi>all Miniſters and others, yea Miniſters
above others,</hi> to ride and run, ſpend their pains and eſtate to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition,
entreat, begge, wait, and never ceaſe to be importunate
for reliefe for theſe oppreſſed <hi>Fellow-creatures,</hi> and many of
them <hi>Fellow citizens</hi> of heaven together with us.</p>
            <p>Behold now the oppreſſions of Townes in open fields and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:59568:10"/>
Market-towns! for when theſe Incloſures have made Farmers,
Cottagers; and Cottagers, Beggars; no way of <hi>livelihood</hi> being
left them: Theſe poor with their families are forced into <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-townes,</hi>
and <hi>open-fielded Townes,</hi> hoping they may finde ſome
employment there to preſerve them and theirs from periſhing.
Whereupon, theſe open-fielded places are ſo loaden with poor,
that the Inhabitants are not able to relieve them. I but theſe
Book-men for Incloſure ſay they pay more Taxes. And truly
well they may, when they lay ſuch burthens upon open fields
that they are not able to bear them; not onely all thoſe poore
the Incloſure have beggered, but all carriages the State hath
need of, free quarter, attendance at the aſſizes and ſeſſions, &amp;c.
The Incloſures got the gaine, and have the eaſe; and poor open
fields pay the ſhot, and endure all the drudgery. What enemies
to the Publique are theſe Incloſures? obſerve how <hi>few or no
ſervice-able men or horſes</hi> in theſe places, for the <hi>defenee</hi> of the
<hi>Nation</hi> when need is: whereas before they were incloſed there
were twenty, thirty, fourty, &amp;c. of both kindes, now ſcarce one
or two. Yes, but one of the laſt Book-men for Incloſure tells
us they are <hi>jaded tyred</hi> horſes. <hi>Oh impudence! let the whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
ſpeake, whether four or five of theſe open-fielded Townes (yea
ſometimes one of them alone) are not able to raiſe a whole Troop of
gallant Horſes, and to ſet valiant men on their backs too, in ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable
a manner, that they were able to make the ſtouteſt Troop to
quake that oppoſed the Parliament formerly, and his Highneſſe the
Lord Protectour of late:</hi> yea, <hi>which they have done too, under both
Governments.</hi> Whereas ſuch Incloſed places can (I believe)
ſcarcely raiſe <hi>one Troop</hi> either for men or horſes, &amp;c. Oh! let
not theſe valiant ſpirited men for the Publique in <hi>Leiceſter-ſhire,</hi>
and their forces be trampled in the dirt by ſuch Incloſure, to
raiſe a few private perſons upon the <hi>ruine of the ſtrength of the
Nation.</hi> Surely if a <hi>Jericho</hi> was again to be beſieged, there would
be found good ſtore of <hi>Rams hornes,</hi> though but <hi>few perſons
to winde them</hi> in theſe Incloſed places. But theſe Book-men for
Incloſure ſay, that the common fields cauſe many <hi>Law ſuits</hi> &amp;c.
I ſhall (God willing) anſwer all as I paſſe through this Text of
Scripture. <hi>Firſt,</hi> there are offenders both within hedges and
without too, and loving hearts will paſſe by an offence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:59568:11"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> in common fields they live like loving neighbours
together for the moſt part, till the <hi>spirit of Incloſure enter</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
ſome rich Churles heart, who doe not onely pry out but feign
occaſions too to goe to <hi>law</hi> with their neighbours, and no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concilement
to be made till they conſent to Incloſure. For this
is the trick they fall together by the eares with their honeſt
neighbours, that they bring their deſigne about. Yea, but there
is ſo much <hi>ſtealing and filching</hi> by the Poore. But thank Inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
for that, which hath filled openfield Towns ſo full of Poore
they cannot live one by another, For, Poverty is a provoking
argument to ſteale. And therefore <hi>Agur</hi> prayes, <hi>Prov. 30. 8.
Give me not poverty,</hi> and why ſo? the ninth Verſe tells us, <hi>leſt
I be poore and ſteale.</hi> And thus Incloſure makes thieves, and
then they cry out of thieves.</p>
            <q>Becauſe they ſold the Righteous for ſilver, and the poore for a
payre of ſhooes.</q>
            <p>
               <hi>The Righteous:</hi> who are thoſe? Not to ſtand upon the divers
acceptations of the word <hi>[Righteous,]</hi> Ile ſhew what is meant
by a righteous man, <hi>viz: The Evangelicall righteous man is one,</hi>
who, as he hath the Righteouſneſſe of Jeſus Chriſt <hi>imputed</hi> unto
him, ſo he hath in ſome meaſure the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt
<hi>imparted</hi> unto him, deſiring and endeavouring <hi>to keep the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements
of God, and the faith of Jeſus,</hi> Rev. 14. 12. <hi>He is one
that loves God above all, and his neighbour as himſelf,</hi> Mat. 22. 37,
38, 39. <hi>He is one,</hi> 1 Joh. 4 21. <hi>who as he loveth</hi> God, <hi>loveth his
neighbour alſo.</hi> Oh! how pretious are theſe Righteous ones in
heaven? <hi>They are the Lords people, his portion, the lot of his Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance,</hi>
Deut. 32. 9. They are the Lords <hi>owne,</hi> his very <hi>jewells:</hi>
All the reſt of a Town are but the <hi>rubbiſh</hi> amongſt whom theſe
his <hi>jewells lye and live for a while.</hi> And to ſpeak the truth (for
truth muſt be ſpoken however it be taken) if the Lord had not
had <hi>two</hi> of <hi>theſe Righteous ones, or three of theſe Iewels,</hi> that as
they love God they love their neighbour alſo, in many Townes
of theſe Inland Counties, what deſolations had there been made
ere this time by ſuch Incloſure?</p>
            <p>Theſe incloſuriſts ſell the <hi>Righteous for ſilver.</hi> What care they
for Gods jewells, his portion, <hi>his inheritance,</hi> ſo they may im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
their <hi>own inheritance?</hi> what cared <hi>Judas for Jeſus Chriſt
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:59568:11"/>
the Righteous,</hi> ſo he might get <hi>thirty pieces of ſilver</hi> by him? What
care theſe men for the <hi>tender conſciences</hi> of any of theſe Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
ones, that dare not conſent to ſuch incloſure? They will
make them make ſhipwrack of faith and a good conſcience, or
elſe eſtates and liberties and all muſt be ruined by multiplicities
of triviall Law ſuites in common Law and Chancery, threatning
they will not leave them a ſhift to their backs, nor a cow to
their payle. I could here give you a large Catalogue of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt
vexations of ſuch Righteous ones, but becauſe ſome of their
vexers pretend to religion, I will ſpare them, <hi>One of theſe two
evills are incident to ſuch as dare not in conſcience conſent to ſuch
incloſure,</hi> viz. <hi>Either to be undone in the inward, or el<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
man, chooſe them which. If they goe againſt conſcience in the
inward man; if they will keep a good conſcience in the outward man,</hi>
and here let the <hi>incloſuriſts</hi> of <hi>Cat thorpe</hi> in <hi>Leiceſter-ſhire</hi> trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
to have no reſpect to the conſcience of one of theſe righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
men (their owne conſciences I believe judging him ſuch a
one) nor to his vow to his God made upon good ground in the
ſight both of God and good men, nor to his right in law, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to a petition that is now depending before his <hi>Highneſſe
and his most Honourable Councell,</hi> in which there is made <hi>a good
progreſs</hi> and good hopes <hi>(praiſed be God)</hi> of a <hi>happy iſſue.</hi> It mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
not what one of the Book-men for incloſure truely prattles
to the contrary. He makes but a Jeer of a good conſcience in his
Book. And as for his right in Law, becauſe it is but a little to
their great deale, they may alter the propriety of it as they liſt,
without his conſent, and ſet hedges and ditches upon his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
whether he will or no. I wonder who made theſe men <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viders</hi>
of his common from theirs, when he hath a right and
propriety in every foot of common in all their fields. Is there
not the ſame right <hi>in Law</hi> to a <hi>little</hi> as a <hi>great deale?</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <q>And the poore for a paire of ſhooes.</q>
            <p>
               <hi>The Poore.</hi> Well may they ſell the <hi>Poore</hi> for a paire of ſhooes,
when they ſell the <hi>Righteous</hi> for ſilver. When <hi>Judas</hi> ſold his
Maſter <hi>That Righteous one</hi> for ſilver (let Miniſters remember
<hi>Judas</hi> was a Diſciple) no wonder if he <hi>cared not for the Poore.</hi>
But theſe incloſuriſts have the poore much in their mouthes, and
how they provide for the poore. My exhortation to them is
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:59568:12"/>
               <hi>1 Joh. 3. 18. My little children let us net love in word neither in
tongue, but in deed and in truth.</hi> Saint <hi>James ſhewes us that a few
words will not warm, nor feede, nor cloath poore people,</hi> James 2.
16. <hi>If one of you ſay unto them, depart in peace, be you warmed,
and filled, notwithſtanding you give them not theſe things which
are needfull to the body, what doth it profit?</hi> Alas, what will all
their good words profit the poore, when they doe not only not
give them thoſe things which are needfull for the body, but
take away at once all things that are needfull for the body, even
the <hi>Trade of Tillage</hi> which ſhould warme, cloath, feede them
and their families. But theſe book-men for incloſure have <hi>arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi>
yea, and <hi>acres</hi> for the Poore too. What would theſe men
be thought charitable men? Let <hi>Iudas</hi> be thought ſo too. For
he would have the <hi>oyntment ſold for three hundred pence, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to the Poore, John 12. 5.</hi> Truth is, former Incloſuriſts have
been very ſpecious and pretending for the poore in their <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,
Articles, Acres,</hi> when they were hot upon their buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of incloſure, to <hi>ſtop the mouthes</hi> of Poore and Country
from clamours; and theſe incloſures of the <hi>laſt Edition</hi> which
they are now about are but ſordid in reſpect of the former in
that kinde. But wofull experience tells us, a ſhort time forced
all the Tenants and Cottagers out of moſt of thoſe places into
the open fielded Towns to ſeek for a livelyhood where they
can finde it, to the great oppreſſions of thoſe Townes.</p>
            <q>That pant after the dust of the earth upon the head of the
Poore.</q>
            <p>
               <hi>Pant,</hi> that is, exceedingly deſire it, and long for it. <hi>After the
duſt of the earth,</hi> that is, after thoſe things which are but as the
duſt of the earth, and whoſe originall and matter is but the duſt
of the earth. Oh the exceſſive deſire (after ſuch Incloſure and
the gain that comes by it) execeding the bounds of piety, equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
charity, and humanity it ſelf, as you have heard! <hi>Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
of eſtate is this mans <hi>bayte.</hi> And if any thing goe about to
hinder that, he is like a Lyon ſtirred up at the ſight of his prey,
and makes no conſcience of devouring <hi>men, women, and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi>
that ſtand in his way.</p>
            <p>The <hi>ſerpent</hi> feeds upon the <hi>duſt of the earth:</hi> It feeds upon
<hi>baſe</hi> and <hi>low things, vile and venomous:</hi> ſo doe covetous, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileſſe
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:59568:12"/>
men. As the Serpent licks the <hi>duſt of the earth;</hi> ſo doe
they lick the <hi>duſt of the earth,</hi> they feed upon blood, upon op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion;
<hi>They pant after the duſt of the earth,</hi> they pant after
the eſtate and means that poor men have in Town or Field, and
feed upon it, to ſatisfie (if it were poſſible) their greedy appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites
in ſucking the eſtates and cruſhing the bones of the poore.
The Prophet <hi>Habakkuk</hi> hath a woe for theſe, <hi>Hab. 2.</hi> v. 6.
<hi>Woe to him that encreaſeth that which is not his</hi> (to wit, in the
Court of Conſcience aſwell as in the Court of the Law) <hi>and
ladeth himſelf with thick clay. Lutum ſcite pictum,</hi> with gold
and ſilver, the fineſt duſt and pieces of the earth, whereby all
the reſt of the commodities of the earth are valued. This duſt
of the earth, this thick clay doth but load and burthen their
ſoules and conſciences, and makes them drive heavily heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
Gods glory ward, and their own ſalvation-ward. This
thick clay doth them no more good than that gold and ſilver
and embroydered cloath of arras a <hi>ſumpter-horſe</hi> is burthen'd
with all day, and at night is turned with the reſt of the Jades
with a gauled and bruiſed back into the ſtable. Oh take heed
of a gauled conſcience loaded and bruiſed with ſuch <hi>hedges and
ditches</hi> as hedge out Publique and Poor; leſt at the night of
Death thou be turned with the reſt of the Jades of worldlings,
<hi>Dives</hi>-like, into the Devils ſtable.</p>
            <q>Vpon the head of the Poore.</q>
            <p>
               <hi>They pant after the duſt of the earth,</hi> but upon whoſe head?
<hi>upon the head of the Poore.</hi> Theſe beaſts will be ſure to goe over
where the hedge is loweſt. In any towne where there is any rich
men Publique ſpirited, and have bowels toward the Poore, there
theſe greedy gripes dare not meddle with their matches, and
cannot force them to ſuch incloſure, becauſe they are able to
defend themſelves. But on the contrary in any towne where
there are mercifull men, Publique ſpirited men &amp;c. That dare
not in conſcience conſent to ſuch incloſure, If theſe be men but
of meane eſtates, theſe mercileſſe wretches joyne purſes, and
make no more conſcience to trample upon theſe righteous poor,
yea, upon their conſciences, eſtates, liberties, and whole fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
then they doe to trample upon the mire in the ſtreets.</p>
            <q>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:59568:13"/>And turne aſide the way of the meek.</q>
            <p>Theſe incl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſuriſts turne aſide the way of the meek theſe three
wayes. <hi>Firſt,</hi> they turne aſide the way of Juſtice and Equity
which is the meanes of keeping and recovering their right. A
great purſe will make a good cauſe though it be ſtarke naught.
What ſay theſe Mammoniſts when any croſſe them in ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſure,
their word is, <hi>I'le undoe him if he will not yeild.</hi> And
how is that? By ſuites in Law and Chancery. And have not theſe
men been as good as their words? I could here tell ſad ſtories.
But I intend to name no man in this preſent diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>they turne aſide the way of the meeke</hi> when they take
away the way of their livelyhood. Now <hi>Tillage</hi> is the way, the
calling, the profeſſion which moſt of the inhabitants of <hi>Inland</hi>
Counties live of, as we have proved.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>they turne aſide the way of the meeke:</hi> Why? What
is the way of the meek? The <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> tells us <hi>(Pſal. 25. 9.)</hi> it
is Gods way. <hi>The meeke he will teach his way.</hi> They endeavour
to turne them out of the way of faith and a good conſcience, in
perſwading them if that will not doe, and compelling them to
doe againſt conſcience, or undoe. But I conclude with the wiſe
mans exhortation, <hi>Prov</hi> 22. 22, 23. Rob not the poor becauſe he is
poore, neither oppreſſe the afflicted in the gate. For the Lord will
plead their cauſe, and spoyle the ſoule of thoſe that spoyled their.</p>
