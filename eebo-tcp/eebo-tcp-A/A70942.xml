            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

diſcourſed of a
Maritimall voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
and the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages
and incidents therein, I
thinke it not impertinent nor
differing from my purpoſe, to
ſecond the ſame with ſome ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
relations concerning the
Royall Navy, with the Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and Offices thereto belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
For, as the perfection and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60815:3"/>
excellency of our Shipping is
great and remarkeable, ſo the
imperfections and defects of
the ſame by uſe and experience
of late years, have been found to
be divers and inconvenient, as
it falls out many times in the
circumſtances of Land ſervice
by the charige of Armes, diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities
of Fortifications, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration
of Diſcipline. And
therefore for the due reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
many things are neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
and particularly to be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
and conſidered of in their
Order. In regard whereof, I
will firſt begin with the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
and therein crave pardon
(if in ſpeaking plainly and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in a matter of ſo great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance)
I doe ſet aſide all
private reſpects and partiality.
For in that which concerns the
ſervice and benefit of my
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60815:3"/>
Prince and Country, I will ſay
with <hi>Cicero, Nil mihi melius,
nil mihi Charius.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
not juſtly to be taxed with
any preſumption for medling
with matters wherein I have no
dealings nor charge. For that in

For ſometimes by the

many times by the mediation
of great men for the preferment

ſuch like means, ſome people
very raw and ignorant, are very

ſhould be builded by the great,
as divers of them have been; For
by daily experience they are
found be the moſt weake, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect,
and unſerviceable Ships
of all the reſt. And it is not
otherwiſe to be preſumed, But
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60815:5"/>
as the Officers would bee
thought to be very frugall for
his Majeſty in driving a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
by the great at a neere
rate with the Shipwright, So
likewiſe the Shipwright on his
part will be as carefull to gaine
by his labour, or at leaſt to ſave
himſelfe harmleſſe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſuite his worke ſlightly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

of the which preſent ſparing
and untimely thrift, there
grows many future inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
and continuall Charge in
repayring and reedifying ſuch
imperfect ſlight built Veſſells.
The proofe and experience
whereof hath been often found
in new Shipps built at thoſe
rates, but ſo weakly, as that in
their voyages, they have been
ready to founder in the Seas
with every Extraordinary
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60815:5"/>
ſtorme, and at their returne
been enforced to be new built.
But ſeeing the Officers of the
Admiralty doe hold (by the
grace of his Majeſtie) places of
ſo good Credit and beneſit, it is
their parts therefore (being well
waged and rewarded for the
ſame) exactly to look into the
ſound building of Ships,<note place="margin">Officers of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miraltie exactly to look into the ſound building of Ships, &amp;c.</note> and
to imploy their care and travell
aſwell in the over ſight thereof,
as to provide that all things elſe
belonging to the Navy be good
and well conditioned: For the
ſtrong and true building of a
Ship is not to be left barely to
the fidelity of a Marchanticall
Artificer (the chiefe end of
whoſe worke in his owne Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt
is his profit and gaine)
but ſome Superior Officer
ought to have a further regard
in that buſineſſe, if he be ſuch a
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:60815:6"/>
one as hath more judgement in
the building and conditioning
of a Ship, then devotion to his
owne eaſe and profit.</p>
               <p>Moreover if any decayed
Ship be intended to be new
made, it is more fit and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to make her a ſize leſſe
then ſhe was, then bigger; For
then her beams which were laid
over-thwart from ſide to ſide,
will ſerve againe, and moſt of
her Tymbers and other parts
will ſay well to the building of
a new ſhip. But if ſhe ſhould
be made a ſize bigger, the Tym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber

ſaith the Spaniard, a ſhip of
600 Tuns will carry as good
Ordnance, as a ſhip of 1200.
Tuns, and though the greater
have double her number, the
leſſer will turne her broad ſides
twice, before the greater can
wend once, and ſo no advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
in that overplus of Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.
And in the building of
all ſhips, theſe ſix things are
principally required.</p>
               <p>1. Firſt, that ſhe be ſtrong
built.</p>
               <p>2. Secondly, that ſhee bee

               <p>3. Thirdly, that ſhe be ſtout
ſided.</p>
               <p>4. Fourthly, that ſhe carry
out her Guns all weather.</p>
               <p>5. Fifthly, that ſhe hull and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60815:7"/>
try well, which we call a good
Sea-ſhip.</p>
               <p>6. Sixthly, that ſhee ſtay
well, when bourding and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
on a wind is required.</p>
               <p>1. To make her ſtrong con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth
in the truth of the
Workeman, and the care of the
Officers.</p>
               <p>2. To make her ſayle well
is to give a long run forward,
and ſo afterward done by Art
and juſt proportion. For as in
laying out of her bows before
and quarters behind, ſhe neither
ſinck into, nor hang in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,<note place="margin">A caution for Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrights.</note>
but lye cleare off and above
it, And that the Shipwrights
be not deceived herein (as for
the moſt part they have ever
been) they muſt be ſure, that the
Ship ſinck no deeper into the
water, then they promiſe, for
other wiſe the bow and quarter
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:60815:7"/>
will utterly ſpoile her ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</p>
               <p>3. That ſhe bee ſtout, the
ſame is provided and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by a long bearing Floore,
and by ſharing off above water
even from the lower edge of the
Ports.</p>
               <p>4. To carry out her Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
all weather, This long
bearing Floore, and ſharing off
from above the Ports is a chiefe
Cauſe, Provided alwayes, that
your loweſt Tyre of Ordnance
muſt lye foure foot cleare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
water when all loading is
in, or elſe thoſe your beſt pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
will be of ſmall uſe at the
Sea in any growne weather
that makes the Billoe to riſe,
for then you ſhall be enforced
to take in all your lower Ports,
or elſe hazard the Ship.<note place="margin">

true, that thoſe over long Ships

By the which means his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie
ſhould ever have Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of good accompt his owne

being (indeed) a great indigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to his Majeſty, to his ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping

For that in times paſt, it
hath been reputed a great grace
to any man of the beſt ſort, to
have the Charge of the Princes

               <p>But now foraſmuch as I

all thoſe points that I<note place="margin">Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note>
have have formerly ſpoken of,
and ſay unto me, why ſhould
his Majeſty and the State bee
troubled with this needleſſe
Charge of keeping and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
ſo great a Navy in ſuch
exquiſite perfection, and readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe?
the times being now
peaceable, and little uſe of
Armes or Ships of Warre, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
at home or abroad, but all
ſafe and ſecure, aſwell by the
uniting of the two Nations, as
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:60815:23"/>
by the peace which we hold with
<hi>Spaine,</hi> and all other Chriſtian
Princes. To this I anſwer, that
this (indeed) may ſtand (at the
firſt ſight) for a prettie ſuperſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
argument to bleare our
eys, and lull us aſleep in ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and make us negligent and
careleſſe of thoſe cauſes from
whence the effects of peace
grows, and by the vertue where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
it muſt be maintained. But
we muſt not flatter and deceive
our ſelves, to thinke that this
Calme and Concord proceeds
either from a ſetled immutable
tranquillity in the world
(which is full of alterations
and various humours) or from
the good affections of our late
enemies, who have taſted too
many diſgraces, repulſes, and
loſſes, by our forces and ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,
to wiſh our State ſo much
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:60815:24"/>
felicity as a happy and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
government, if otherwiſe
they had power to hinder it.
And therefore though the
ſword be put into the Sheath,
we muſt not ſuffer it there to
ruſt, or ſtick ſo faſt, as that we
ſhall not be able to draw it rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
when need requires. For
albeit our enemies have of late
years ſought peace with us, yet
yet hath it proceeded out of the
former tryall of our forces in
times of war and Enmity. And
therefore we may well ſay of
them as <hi>Anneus (Pretor</hi> of the
Latines) ſaid of the Roman
Ambaſſadours, who ſeemed cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
and carefull to have the
League maintained betweene
them (which the Roman eſtate
was not accuſtomed to ſeeke at
their neighbours hands) and
thereupon ſaith this <hi>Anneus,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:60815:24"/>
unde haec illis tanta modeſtia niſi
ex cognitione virium &amp; noſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
&amp; ſuarum.</hi> For with the
like conſideration and reſpect
have our late enemies ſought to
renew the ancient friendſhip
and peace with us. And well
we may be aſſured, that if thoſe
powerfull means whereby we
reduced them to that modeſty
and curteſie as to ſeeke us, were
utterly laid aſide and neglected,
ſo as we could not againe upon
occaſion readily aſſume the uſe
and benefit of them, as we have
done, thoſe proud maſtering
ſpirits, finding us at ſuch advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
would be more ready and
willing to ſhake us by the ears
as enemies, then to take us by
the hands as friends. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
far be it from our hearts to
truſt more to that friendſhip of
ſtrangers, that is but diſſembled
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:60815:25"/>
upon policy and neceſſity, then
to the ſtrength of our owne for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
which hath been experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced
with ſo happy ſucceſſe.
I confeſſe that peace is a great
bleſſing of God, and bleſſed are
the Peacemakers, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
doubtleſſe bleſſed are thoſe
means whereby peace is gained
and maintained. For well we
know that God worketh all
things here amongſt us medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly
by a ſecondary means,
The which meanes of our
defence and ſafety being ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,
and Sea-Forces, are to be
eſteemed as his guifts, and then
only availeable and beneficiall,
when he withall vouchſafeth
his grace to uſe them aright.</p>
