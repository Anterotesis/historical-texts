            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>FIrst, his Maiestie commandeth that no Seaman or Mariner whatsoeuer, shalbe suffered to put himselfe into any Warlike seruice at Sea of any forreine Prince or State, straightly charging all that are in any such Seruice already, to leaue the same presently and without delay, and to record their apparance in their natiue Countrey, to some of his Maiesties Officers, vpon paine to be held and punished as Pirats.</p>
            <p>Item, If any person offending, doe at any time hereafter come into any port, or place of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties Dominions, vpon what pretext soeuer: his Maiestie expresly chargeth all his Officers foorth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to apprehend the same, and to commit them to prison without Baile or Mainprise, and the Certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficat thereof to be presently returned into the Admiraltie Court, to the ende that they may bee procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded withall, according to the Lawes of the Realme, and the contents of his Maiesties former Proclamations.</p>
            <p>Item, His Maiestie commandeth all his Subiects, (as they will auoyd his heauie indignation) to forbeare to be aiding or receiuing of any Pirats, or such persons as shall continue in any such Warlike seruice, as aforesaid, or any person not being a knowen Merchant, by contracting, buying, selling, or by victualling of them, or any of their Company, vpon paine for so doing, to be punished presently, as the principall Offendors and Pirats ought to be.</p>
            <p>Item, That no shipping, or men of warre, of what estate or condition soeuer, going forth with commission of reprisall, or in any other warlike maner to serue at Seas, shall be permitted in any of his Maiesties ports, or in the members thereof to victual or relieue themselues with any warlike pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uisions, thereby to enable themselues the better, to any acts of hostilitie at Sea against any of his Maiesties friends: but onely in their returne homewards, if they happen to come into any of his Maiesties ports, that then it shall be lawfull for them to relieue themselues with victuall, or other necessaries to serue them onely for the space of twentie dayes and no more, which is a proportion rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable to vse in trade of merchandize.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:28746:2"/>Item, That all vice admirals, Customers, or other officers of the Ports shall not suffer any Ship of his Maiesties subiects to goe to the Seas, before such time as they (respectiuely in their seuerall ports) haue duely searched and visited the same, to the intent to stay such persons as apparantly shall be furnished for the warres, and not for merchandise or fishing. And if there shall be any maner of suspition, that the said person (though he shall pretend to trade for merchandise or fishing) hath or may haue any other intent by his prouisions or furniture, then to vse the trade of merchandise or fishing, that in such case of suspition, the officers of the Ports shall stay, and no wayes suffer the same to passe to the Seas, without good bands with sufficient sureties first had, to vse nothing, but the lawfull trade of merchandise or fishing. And if the said officers shall suffer any persons otherwise to repaire to the Seas, then aboue is mentioned, they shall not onely answere for any Pyracies, which any such person shall chance hereafter to commit vpon the Seas, but shall suffer imprisonment vntill the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders may be apprehended, if they shall be liuing.</p>
            <p>And further, as his Maiestie declareth and denounceth generally all such Pyrates and Rouers vpon the Seas to be out of his protection, and therefore to be lawfully pursued and punished to the vttermost extremitie: so because his Maiestie presumeth, that all other States and persons in peace and friendship with him, will thinke it iust and honourable to proceede towardes him, with the same sinceritie, which hee obserueth towards them: His Maiestie doeth also hereby notifie to the world, that where it falleth out that diuers of his Subiects are or may bee enterteyned to serue at Sea vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Captaines and Commaunders belonging to some forreine Prince or State, (which are now or may be in termes of Hostility with any of his Maiesties friends) thereby imagining, when they shal (vpon occasion) enter with their Shippes into any of his Maiesties Harboroughs, that they shall be free from any interruption, according to the libertie of Common Amity and correspondency which is vsually obserued betweene Princes in such cases, onely because the Commaunder or Captaine with some few persons besides are straungers, and the rest onely discouered to be his Maiesties Subiects: For as much as his Maiestie (hauing made his iust and equall intentions thus apparant to all men by his publike Proclamations) would be loath to frustrate the expectation of any his friends whome it doth or may concerne: He doth hereby declare to all the world, that if hee shall hereafter finde any such fraudulent course taken, in hope colourably to auoid the true construction of his so iust and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie ordinances, the breach wherof giues cause of further trouble and iealousies to arise betweene his Maiestie and other Princes in the mutuall exercise of their Subiects free trade and entercourse: he will make absolute stay of any such shippes and persons, which shalbe so brought into his Portes or Harboroughs, as persons and thinges wholly exempted from that protection and fauour, which hee entendeth to maintaine and affoord to all others which shall not in such kinde goe about to abuse his Maiesties integritie, whose desire is to receiue no better measure in any thing, then he is willing to yeeld to others vpon the like occasions.</p>
