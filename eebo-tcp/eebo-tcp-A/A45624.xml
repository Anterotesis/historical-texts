            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>An account of the Proceedings, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Bishop of <hi>Exeter</hi> hath so tender a
regard to the interest and reputation of
all the Members of that College, with
the protection whereof his Lordship is
entrusted; that as he could not easily,
without repeated provocation, be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
to pass <hi>Sentence</hi> against <hi>any</hi> of 'em; so he was
not, without very great reluctancy, perswaded to allow
a publication of his proceedings; since however it
might vindicate his Lordship's <hi>Justice,</hi> it must at the
same time expose those things to the eye of the world,
which his <hi>Charity</hi> had much rather have conceal'd.
But finding that his late Visitation has occasion'd abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of discourse, and that reports have been generally
made more according to the inclination of the Relator,
than the truth of the matter, He is at length prevail'd
upon both for his own and his Order's sake, to allow a
plain and impartial <hi>Narrative</hi> of matter of <hi>Fact:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
there are divers circumstances, which might have
been fairly represented with great advantage on his
Lordship's side; but he rather chooses to have a plain
account, with Copies of <hi>Authentick Vouchers</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
it, allowing no reflections but what <hi>they</hi> make,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:56343:3"/>
and to leave the judgment upon the whole matter to
the <hi>indifferent Reader.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I shall therefore endeavor in the following Report to
imitate not only the <hi>Justice</hi> but the <hi>Moderation</hi> and
<hi>Temper</hi> of his Lordship in his proceedings; I shall touch
the offences of no man any farther than they justify his
sentence; but confine my self to the evidence given be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him; and neglect the great <hi>advantage</hi> of a <hi>farther
enquiry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To try <hi>the merits</hi> of this Cause there need no nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of Law; the bare delating of such crimes as were
complain'd of, was a sufficient cause of a <hi>Visitation:</hi>
which had never been obstructed with such <hi>open hosti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi>
and so much <hi>unaccountable ill manners,</hi> nor so
wretched a <hi>Plea</hi> chosen as that to the <hi>Jurisdiction</hi> of an
<hi>Ordinary,</hi> had there been any other way to divert an
enquiry into those <hi>actions,</hi> which the Persons delated
knew could neither be <hi>deny'd</hi> nor <hi>defended.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Punishments</hi> have been so easy and moderate,
that no man, besides the <hi>Rector,</hi> has so much as a colour
of complaint. Many of those Gentlemen that abetted
him are such, as the <hi>Bishop</hi> could wish engag'd in a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Cause, and such as I doubt not, will lay hold on
that opportunity, which his <hi>Lordship</hi> has been pleas'd
to afford 'em, of uniting them-selves to the founder part
of the <hi>Society;</hi> and of owning that <hi>Visitatorial</hi> power,
to which, after so favourable treatment, they are in
<hi>Gratitude</hi> as well as <hi>Justice</hi> obliged to submit.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>late Rector</hi> himself, it is not much to be
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:56343:3"/>
wonder'd at, if he still retain a place in the good opinion
of some few, who mistake the merits of the cause,
having implicitly receiv'd an account of the <hi>Process</hi> from
those very persons who were lyable to the <hi>Sentence:</hi>
But now when the charge and proofs are both made
publick; when so many and <hi>so great</hi> offences appear so
plain and undenyable; when the Visitor's enquiry has
brought to light a secret practice, upon which the
whole University has thought fit to pass so <hi>Solemn</hi> and
so <hi>Unanimous</hi> a <hi>Censure;</hi> 'tis reasonable to believe that
those only will <hi>openly</hi> defend his <hi>Cause,</hi> who <hi>secretly</hi>
abett his <hi>opinions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having now said as much as I thought requisite by
way of <hi>Introduction,</hi> I should next proceed to the <hi>Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi>
it self; and recite the offences that went before
it, the opposition that was made to it; the peaceable
execution of it at last; and the just, and moderate sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences,
that were pass'd in it. But since the exceptions of
the <hi>Rector</hi> to the <hi>Visitor's</hi> Autority are chiefly ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on some former procedures of his <hi>Lordship</hi> in Mr.
<hi>Colmer's</hi> Appeal; I think it necessary to take the rise
of this discourse, higher than I at first design'd; and in
the following method, to give an impartial account,</p>
            <p>1. Of the Expulsion and Appeal of Mr. <hi>Colmer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Of the Proceedings of the Bishop, and his Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
upon the <hi>Appeal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:56343:4"/>
3. Of the Crimes of the Rector, and others, that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion'd
the <hi>General</hi> Visitation.</p>
            <p>4. Of the <hi>General Visitation</hi> it self: of the Evidence
there given; and of the Sentence there pronounc'd.</p>
            <p>Upon the <hi>first head</hi> it will appear, that, whether Mr.
<hi>Colmer</hi> be innocent or not, the <hi>Bishop</hi> had such <hi>Presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
proofes</hi> of his Innocence; as must in justice oblige
him to receive his appeal; and to grant a <hi>re-hearing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon the <hi>second,</hi> it will be evident, That the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop</hi>
gave the <hi>Rector</hi> all imaginable advantage for the
Conviction of Mr. <hi>Colmer;</hi> and consequently, That,
if he be guilty, it is a <hi>new crime of the Rector, and of
him only,</hi> that he is exempted from punishment.</p>
            <p>Under the two <hi>last heads,</hi> The Offences charged
upon the <hi>Rector,</hi> will be fully made out.</p>
            <p>And, throughout the whole discourse, the grounds
upon which the <hi>Visitor</hi> proceeded will be occasionally
given; and the cavils of the <hi>Rector</hi> against his Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
will receive short, clear, and satisfactory answers.</p>
            <div n="1" type="section">
               <head>1 Concerning the Expulsion and Appeal
of Mr. Colmer.</head>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi> was a Gentleman, whose demeanour
in the College had formerly been such, that it much
recommended him to the favor of the <hi>Rector,</hi> and
his family. The <hi>Rector</hi> in a printed paper openly
professes, that he <hi>held a greater familiarity with him
than is usual between the Rector,</hi> and a <hi>Junior Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56343:4"/>
of a College.</hi> What were the secret springs either
of this intimacy, or of distast afterwards, as things
transacted in a family, we think it not fit to publish,
but what appear'd above board was as follows.</p>
               <p>About <hi>December</hi> then 1688, when <hi>Sir Kingston</hi> stood
Candidate for a Chaplain-Fellowship; the <hi>Rector</hi> vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently
espous'd his interest, as knowing that he could
afterwards command his Vote, and by it, (as he himself
profess'd) <hi>make the division of the College so equal,</hi> that
the sole absolute power of determination in all causes
should fall upon <hi>him-self.</hi> And since, Mr. <hi>Colmer,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not ignorant of Mr. <hi>Kingstons</hi> manners, and former
demeanour in the College, nor insensible of the Rector's
design in promoting him, thought it his duty to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr
with many of the Fellows in opposing this Election;
The <hi>Rector</hi> openly declar'd, <hi>that he would upon that
account compass Mr.</hi> Colmers <hi>Expulsion.</hi> In order to
this, some moneths after, he charges him privatly with
incontinence; and endeavours to frighten him into a
resignation of his Fellowship. When that project
fail'd and Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi> insisted on his <hi>innocence;</hi> and
seemed not at all apprehensive of any danger on
that account; The <hi>Rector</hi> accused him before the <hi>Vice-Chancellor;</hi>
and procur'd <hi>his</hi> warrant to summon one
<hi>Smith</hi> before him, and to take his depositions. The Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of <hi>Smith</hi> was so far from charging Mr. <hi>Colmer,</hi>
that it wholly justify'd his innocence; and the other
allegations of the <hi>Rector</hi> seem'd so trivial, and incohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
that the <hi>Vice-Chancellor</hi> thought fit to dismiss the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:56343:5"/>
cause. When this design therefore met with no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
success than the other, the <hi>Rector</hi> desisted from
the troublesom course of examining <hi>Witnesses before
a Magistrate,</hi> and resolv'd on a more compendious
method of expelling him by bringing the Cause <hi>before
himself.</hi> Accordingly on Oct. 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. 1689. The <hi>Rector</hi>
call'd a meeting of the <hi>seven Senior Fellows,</hi> and
told them that the occasion of it was a <hi>business in
which he was to act the part both of an Accuser, and
a Judge;</hi> and he might have added, of a <hi>Witness</hi>
too: For, upon the Tryal, he accus'd Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi> of
lying with one <hi>Ann Sparrow,</hi> who had lately been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd
of a Bastard: and for evidence, he took his <hi>vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary Oath,</hi>
that <hi>Smith</hi> after much importunity
us'd with him in his Closet to confess at whose expence
he maintain'd the Woman, desir'd <hi>time</hi> to <hi>speak with
his Friend.</hi> This Friend, the <hi>Rector</hi> was resolv'd should
be interpreted Mr. <hi>Colmer;</hi> and thence inferr'd that <hi>he</hi>
maintain'd the Woman and was Father of the Child,
tho' <hi>Smith,</hi> who appeared at the meeting, avow'd, that
he knew no such thing of <hi>him;</hi> and that the <hi>Rector</hi>
misrepresented his words; and mistook his meaning.
Upon <hi>no other Oath than this,</hi> founded upon a false
surmise, taken by <hi>him,</hi> who was his <hi>Judge,</hi> and professed
himselfe his <hi>Accuser,</hi> Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi> was declar'd <hi>legally
convicted</hi> of <hi>incontinence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There were indeed other <hi>Allegations</hi> in this Cause;
but those, bare <hi>Allegations,</hi> without proof; and not
sufficient to justify the Charge, if they had been prov'd.
It was <hi>said</hi> that the <hi>Rector's</hi> wife <hi>said,</hi> that a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:56343:5"/>
maid <hi>said</hi> to her; That she had formerly <hi>said</hi> to
another Woman, That Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi> was <hi>uncivil</hi> to her;
But the Maid, that was <hi>said</hi> to have <hi>said</hi> this, though
in Town, was not produc'd; and the Woman, who
was <hi>said</hi> to have receiv'd the complaint, was there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
and <hi>denied</hi> it. Traditional stories, Hear-says and
Reports were urg'd against him; but the authors of them,
tho' Servants of the Colledge; and subject to the Rector's
Summons, were not call'd, nor produc'd. On the other
side two <hi>Divines</hi> attested upon Oath, That the party,
which was with Child, not only acquitted Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi>
before them, but own'd, that she had been dealt with
to accuse him. Against this plain, and express evidence,
and against the Testimony of <hi>Smith,</hi> who was said to
be his Accuser, The equivocal expressions, general words,
and frivolous discourse of some talkative Women, ill
attested, without Oath, and at second hand, were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
and credited; and upon <hi>these Proofs,</hi> and upon
<hi>this process only,</hi> Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi> was expell'd; and <hi>devested</hi>
of his <hi>Free-hold.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is natural for men, that use <hi>such process</hi> as this, to
shun a <hi>re-hearing;</hi> and therefore it is no wonder, if now
the Rector pretended, That this his <hi>interlocutory</hi> sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
was <hi>conclusive;</hi> and <hi>final,</hi> and that Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi> was
by Oath barr'd from any appeal to the Visitor. If
the Statutes and the Oath, that was founded upon
them, had been capable of such a sense, it would have
been a great hardship on Mr. <hi>Colmer,</hi> who avow'd his
own innocence, to have been necessarily expos'd either
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:56343:6"/>
to the scandal of <hi>Fornication,</hi> or to the guilt of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury.</hi>
However he was resolv'd to consider his Oath,
to undergo his misfortune, and to proceed no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
in his appeal, than it was permitted, and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted
by Statute. But, Upon the perusal of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes;
and the consideration of the evidence given
against him; he was himself convinc'd; and was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd
in his opinion by Dr. <hi>Bouchier,</hi> Professor of the
Civil-Law in <hi>Oxford;</hi> that he had free liberty; and just
cause of appeal to the Visitor. The Motives, that
prevail'd with him to think so, were such as these.</p>
               <p>1. That the Oath,<note n="a" place="bottom">See the Probationers Oath. Si contingat me (quod absit) <hi>juxta formam</hi> &amp; <hi>exigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam Statutorum,</hi> à praedicto Collegio, Expelli seu amoveri &amp;c.

               </p>
               <p>2. That, (the Statute requiring<note n="b" place="bottom">In the Statute, De Causis <hi>propter quas Scholares privari debeant.</hi> Siquis Scholarium vel Electorum; adulterii. incontinentiae, haeresis pertinacis, homicidii voluntarii &amp;c. <hi>le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitime convictus fuerit;</hi> ipsum perpetuo exclusum &amp;c. decernimus.</note> a <hi>legal conviction;</hi>
and the Proofs in Mr. <hi>Colmer's</hi> Case being so far from

was <hi>not Statutably Expell'd,</hi> and consequently <hi>not barr'd
from appeal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. That in the Oath it-self the word<note n="c" place="bottom">Si contingat me posthac per Rectorem aut in hujusmodi interesse habentes, corrigi, puniri, aut à dicti Collegii sustentatione ejici, &amp; expelli, excludi, privari, velamoveri propter <hi>mea</hi> forsan <hi>demerita,</hi> ipsum Rectorem &amp;c. nunquam persequar; molestabo vel inquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabo, &amp;c. quantumcunque <hi>alias mihi probitatis,</hi> &amp; vitae <hi>merita</hi> suffragentur.</note>

the College from any <hi>action at Law,</hi> or any other di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbance

That of <hi>appeal to the Visitor,</hi> which was most
obvious to be thought on, is not <hi>expresly</hi> mention'd nor
forbidden: and therefore that those General words,
may in an equitable sense be intended to restrain the
party from all appeals to an <hi>Extraneous,</hi> not to a <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mestick</hi>
Court; to one that is a <hi>forraign</hi> Judge, not
to a <hi>Visitor,</hi> who is a <hi>part,</hi> and the <hi>first Member,</hi> of <hi>the
College.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. That these interpretations of the Oath ought to be
receiv'd, as being most consonant to Law; and such
as are least tending to establish <hi>arbitrary power;</hi> and to
ex<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>lude <hi>legal remedies</hi> against wrong-doing.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi> therefore finding that he had liberty of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:56343:7"/>
appeal from grievances; and knowing that none could
receive his appeal, but the <hi>Ordinary;</hi> made his appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
to the Bishop of <hi>Exeter, Successor</hi> of the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of that College, <hi>Patron, Ordinary</hi> and <hi>Visitor</hi>
thereof. He insisted much on his own innocence, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
to his Lordship the injustice of the Rector's
procedures, the invalidity of the evidence against him;
and the credibility of the proofs offerr'd in his favor.
Among other things, he shew'd to his Lordship the
<hi>Affidavit</hi> made by <hi>Ann Sparrow,</hi> the Mother of the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stard
Child; who being put to her Oath before an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derman
of <hi>Oxford,</hi> acquitted Mr. <hi>Colmer;</hi> and nam'd
the Person one <hi>Roberts,</hi> who had tempted her to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
him. His Lordship was farther inform'd, that a
great part of the College were so sensible of the inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
done to him; and so much at variance with his
judges on that account; that, without the <hi>Ordinarie's</hi>
interposition, these differences could not probably be
compos'd. And lastly he beg'd of his Lordship to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
his appeal; to grant him a new hearing only;
That so the proofs of his innocence, and his guilt might
equally be produc'd; and, according to the just weight
of either of them, the Sentence against him might be
confirm'd or annull'd.</p>
               <p>My Lord of <hi>Exeter</hi> had now a very difficult choice
either of taking upon him a long, expensive, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
an <hi>invidious</hi> trouble, or of neglecting his duty, and
<hi>hazarding the rgihts of his Successors.</hi> The contentious
humour of the <hi>Rector,</hi> which in former instances had
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:56343:7"/>
sufficiently discover'd it-self, gave him prospect of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position;
and his Lordship was not insensible that the
<hi>Nature</hi> of the Cause, which was brought before him,
was capable of <hi>misconstruction.</hi> But these <hi>Prudential</hi>
Dissuasives weigh'd not so much with him, as the stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
motives of <hi>honour, justice,</hi> and <hi>conscience,</hi> which
induc'd him to receive the appeal. He was sworn to
preserve the <hi>rights</hi> of his <hi>See;</hi> and this of receiving ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals
and visiting <hi>Exeter-College</hi> was not only one of
them, but so much the more necessary to be preserv'd,
as his Lordship's <hi>Diocess</hi> hath a more than ordinary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to that College. He knew, that these <hi>arbitrary,</hi>
and <hi>illegal Methods,</hi> however now supported by spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
pretences, might easily on worse occasions be
drawn into precedents; and might give colour for the
usurpation of such an uncontrolable power, as neither
was just nor fit for <hi>such</hi> a <hi>Rector</hi> to enjoy. And, as
to this Case it-self, the dismission of it by the Vice-Chan:
the hasty, and unstatutable proceedings of the <hi>Rector,</hi>
the resentments of part of the College on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
the invalidity of the evidence against Mr. <hi>Colmer;</hi>
and the contradictory testimonies of credible witnesses
then and since offer'd, were sufficient pleas for a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
enquiry. Since therefore the Appeal was neither
<hi>frivolous</hi> nor <hi>vexatious,</hi> his Lordship was convinc'd, that
the admission of it was not a matter of <hi>favor,</hi> but
<hi>justice;</hi> and that he, as <hi>superior judge,</hi> ought of <hi>right,</hi>
and <hi>equity</hi> to <hi>receive</hi> it.</p>
               <p>His Lordship was thus satisfy'd of the <hi>justice</hi> of the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:56343:8"/>
Appeal; nor was he less convinc'd of <hi>his power</hi> of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
it. He had good reason to think, that the Law,
and the College Statutes supported this his authority;
and the arguments, on which he chiefly grounded his
opinion, are (for the satisfaction of others,) here recited,
and made publick.</p>
               <p>1. Since, as it is evident in this Case, A Fellow may
appeal; there must be a <hi>competent Judge</hi> of the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal;
and not only no other immediate Judge, than
the Bishop, can be assign'd; but <hi>all other</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="bottom">See the Statute concerning Visitation. Cui quidem Reverendo Patri, ac Deputato, ac <hi>praeterea nemini</hi> tanquam Patrono, &amp; <hi>Ordinario</hi> Visitatori, vigore praesentis Statuti, plenam concedimus potestatem &amp;c. <hi>Et nulli alii:</hi> ibid. &amp;c.</note> 
                  <hi>Judges</hi> are,
in causes relating to the College, expresly by Statute
<hi>excluded.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. The force of the word <hi>Ordinarius</hi> doth necessarily
import <hi>universality</hi> of Jurisdiction; and therefore where
no <hi>intermedial</hi> Jurisdiction is plac'd any where else, this,
to prevent the defect of justice, must be <hi>let in.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. Altho', by the Statutes, the Visitation of the whole
College be restrain'd to <hi>requisition,</hi> or <hi>five Years;</hi> yet
<note n="b" place="bottom">Patronos, &amp; Visitatores relinquimus, ut ad alvearium conservandum <hi>invigilent;</hi> ut Statuta dicti Collegii firmiter observentur &amp;c. See the Statute concerning Visitation.</note> the words in the beginning of the Statute are general,
and apt for an universal provision; and cannot be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfyed
by a <hi>Quinquennial Visitation</hi> of 3 days; nor
by one upon <hi>requisition;</hi> For there may be a <hi>combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi>
of the majority of the Seniors, who only have
power to desire it.</p>
               <p>4. The Visitor was upon like reasons limited to a
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:56343:8"/>
Quinquennial as a Bishop to a Triennial Visitation; It
was the only design of the Canon in one Case, and of
the Statute in the other to prevent the Charge of <hi>Proxies,</hi>
and <hi>Sportulage;</hi> and therefore as a Bishop when barr'd
from Solemn, and costly Visitations, is not restrain'd from
exercising the ordinary acts of Jurisdiction; so neither,
during the <hi>Quinquennial</hi> Term, doth a Visitor's power
cease; but upon Emergent occasions, in any grievance,
or Appeal, without any Charge of the College, Exerts it
self. The <hi>General enquiry</hi> into matters <hi>undetected</hi> in
both cases is limited; but the <hi>Cognizance</hi> of <hi>matters de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated</hi>
to them is in neither restrained.</p>
               <p>Upon the whole then, the Bishop was sensible, that
Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi> having a presumptive greivance done him
in a matter of a high nature, had free liberty of making
an Appeal; that his Lordship, as <hi>Ordinary,</hi> was Judge
of Appeals; and therefore since the Appeal was law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
and the matter of it just, and equitable; and the
Cognizance of it lay before him, the <hi>Visitor</hi> as in justice,
and prudence he ought, receiv'd and admitted it.</p>

            <div n="2" type="section">
               <head>2 Concerning the Proceedings of the Bishop and his
Commissary upon the Appeal.</head>
               <p>There can be no greater Evidence of the calmness,
and deliberation; which his Lordship us'd in his
proceedings upon the <hi>Appeal,</hi> than the great distance
of the dates between the <hi>Appeal</hi> and the <hi>Commission:</hi>
the one presented on the 24 <hi>Oct.</hi> 1689. and the other
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:56343:9"/>
was not granted before the 21 of <hi>Feb.</hi> following.
Indeed his Lordship being willing, not to expose <hi>the
authority</hi> of the Rector, at first try'd the mildest and
most private methods of enquiring into this Cause,
and adjusting it. He, by letter requir'd 2 of the Fel<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lows,
and as many more as the College should think
fit, to attend him at <hi>London;</hi> and to bring with them
a Copy of the proceedings against Mr. <hi>Colmer,</hi> and
resolv'd, if any Evidence could be offer'd by them,
to confirm the Sentence against him. This was so just;
and so reasonable a demand from a Visitor, that I doubt
not, the Reader will be surpriz'd to hear, that it met
with a denial. A Letter, or rather, a Remonstrance
was sent by the Rector; and in it the Visitor was acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that no <hi>Appeal</hi> at all lay in this Case, and if any, should
lye the matter would not fall under his but the <hi>V. Ch's.</hi>
Cognizance. What slender grounds there were for these
pretences, will herafter appear; at present, I shall pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue
the Relation of Matter of <hi>Fact;</hi> and give you the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
of this answer. Upon this refusal, which was a
new presumption of guilt; and upon the repeated instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Mr. <hi>Colmer;</hi> his Lordship being, immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Parliament, oblig'd to attend the care of his <hi>Diocess,</hi>
granted a Commission, and intrusted this Cause, to Dr.
<hi>Masters</hi> his <hi>Commissary.</hi> If there was no other proof of
his Lordship's impartiality in this affair, there never
was a clearer instance of it given, than in one circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of <hi>this Commission.</hi> For tho' Mr. <hi>Colmer's</hi> Lawyers
did, not without colour of Law, insist, that such Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:56343:9"/>
of rehearing ought to admitt of no more Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
than what, in the last instance, had occasion'd
the first Sentence; yet because his Lordship had heard
that the Rector had obtain'd some fresh proofs of Mr.
<hi>Colmer's</hi> guilt, he was so kind to D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Bury,</hi> and so little
favourable to the Appellant, that he gave the Rector
leave to bring in what fresh matter he could to justify
his former judgement. So that tho' the former Evidence
had been defective; and the process upon it illegal and
arbitrary yet was the Bishop resolv'd to expose the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellant
to any fresh charge; and not to suffer him, if
guilty, to take any advantage of the Rector's hasty, and
Exorbitant proceeding. This single consideration would
acquit My Lord of <hi>Exeter</hi> from any partiality to Mr <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer;</hi>
and yet, since this sometimes hath been, without
any ground, objected to his Lordship. I shall take
leave to anticipate one passage of the like nature in his
General Visitation; and to give it place here. When
the Bishop had by Letter, and Commission endeavour'd
to Convict Mr. <hi>Colmer;</hi> and found at last, that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor,
and his party would not be brought to accuse
him; His Lordship in his Visitation, among the <hi>Articles</hi>
exhibited to those Fellows, who own'd his Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
made this One: <hi>to discover to him any Person in
the College who was guilty or suspected of Incontinence.</hi>
When in their answers no body was return'd suspected of
that Crime; But the Rector himself; When no proofs
against Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi> were produced; and two Material
Affidavits which are here annex'd, were offer'd and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:56343:10"/>
taken in his favor; His Lordship according to the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
of legal Process was oblig'd to acquit, and restore
him. But at the same time the Bishop openly said to him?
<hi>I was resolv'd to have Expell'd you my self at this Visitation;
If I could have by any means obtain'd legal proof of the crime
alleg'd against You; And I do now admonish You to prostrate
Your self before God with Prayers and the sharpest repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;
If Your Conscience upbraids You with the guilt of this
Lewdness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After this short digression (which is a full answer to the
Charge of partiality in his Lordship) it is necessary to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to the Commission it self, and to give an account of
the Acts done by Dr. <hi>Masters</hi> in pursuance of it. The
Commission it self, being granted on Mr. <hi>Colmer's</hi> request,
was wholly restrain'd to his Cause: the <hi>Pow'rs</hi> given were
of no farther Extent, than to the <hi>Matter of the Appeal;</hi>
and the <hi>Process</hi> upon it was suitable to the <hi>Commission.</hi>
Whether we look on the <hi>Citations</hi> that were serv'd, or
the Judicial Acts, that were Executed; these limitations
are every where strictly observ'd: And more remarkably,
when the <hi>Sportulage,</hi> which is due to the Visitor's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missary
upon a Visitation, was offer'd to Dr. <hi>Masters,</hi>
he refus'd the present; and disavow'd his coming
upon a Visitation, as he had before done in Court. So
groundless altogether are their arguments, who main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
that this particular enquiry into Mr. <hi>Colmer's</hi> Case
only, and that <hi>Civiliter,</hi> can be intended or taken for the
Visitor's General, and Solemn Visitation which is alwayes
<hi>Criminally.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:56343:10"/>
When Dr. <hi>Masters</hi> came into the Chappel, he read
his Commission; and acquainted the Rector with the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
there given him, not only to justify his former pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
against Mr. <hi>Colmer;</hi> but to give in any other
fresh Evidence against the Party Expell'd. The Rector
was so far from complying with these just and equitable
demands; that he openly denyed the jurisdiction of that
Court; and set out the <hi>bounds,</hi> or rather the <hi>infinity</hi> of
his own <hi>uncontroulable power. He</hi> said, <hi>That he might Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
all his Fellows if he pleas'd; that he was absolute, and
accountable</hi> to <hi>None;</hi> and <hi>that however arbitrary</hi> his <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
might be, there was no remedy to be obtain'd against
it.</hi> At last having 3 days given him to make out his
Charge against the Appellant, he made no other use of
it, than to draw up two protestations against the Visitor,
with a postscript of Allegations against Mr. <hi>Colmer.</hi> In
<hi>the</hi> first, it was alleged not only that no Appeal in Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
could lye in this Case; but that if any lay, the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitor
was not the <hi>Competent Judge</hi> of it, but the <hi>Vice-Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor.</hi>
The Commissary was abundantly satisfi'd, as of
the Lawfulness of the Appeal; so of the Jurisdiction of
the Visitor in Cases of Appeal, and pronounced for the
validitie of the same. He knew that the <hi>Vice-Chancellour</hi>
(whose right he would have been very tender of) neither
had any title to the Cognizance of this Case, nor laid claim
to any. 'Tis true indeed, that by the Rector's Oath, if
there be any strife or discord between him and his Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
he is oblig'd to stand to the Arbitrement of the <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor,</hi>
or in his absence, of the <hi>Vice-Chancellor</hi> of <hi>Oxford.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:56343:11"/>
But I Since no Jurisdiction is given to the <hi>Vice-Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor</hi>
in the Statutes over the Fellows they are not oblig'd
to own him as <hi>Judge;</hi> But the Rector only is bound to
submit to him, as <hi>Arbitrator.</hi> The Fellows therefore must
not necessarily have recourse to him; but, upon recourse
had, the Rector is sworn not to decline his decision.</p>
               <p>2 That Part of the Oath extends to those private Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tests
which the Rector shall have with the Fellows in his
Personal Capacity agreeable to the Law of the <hi>Vniversity;</hi>
but not to those that shall arise, when he acts <hi>Collegiately</hi>
in Concurrence with the Majority of the <hi>Seniors.</hi> In
the one Case, this intermedial <hi>arbitrement,</hi> for the ease
of the Visitor and of the Fellows, is allow'd: and the Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
have the Security of the Rector's Oath for his <hi>acquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scence.</hi>
In the other, the Cause is immediately devolv'd
to the Ordinary.</p>
               <p>3 At the hearing of this Cause, the Rector expresly
deny'd, that the <hi>Vice-Chancellor,</hi> or any other ought to
intermeddle in it.</p>
               <p>This, and this only was the Exception taken to the
Jurisdiction; nor were the Allegations against the Appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant
more Weighty or Material. The crime of <hi>Inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence</hi>
in General was objected to him; and some <hi>Collateral</hi>
circumstances, which should make out the Charge, were
recited, and tender'd to the <hi>Commissary.</hi> But when <hi>Proof</hi>
of them was requir'd from the Rector; it was answer'd
that he <hi>was not oblig'd to give</hi> it; When a <hi>Lawful</hi> Cause of
Expulsion was insisted on, it was pretended, that a <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable</hi>
Cause was sufficient, and when a reasonable Cause
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:56343:11"/>
was to be desined, it was such as the Rector and the
majority of the 7 seniors should <hi>think</hi> to be <hi>reasonable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Commissary was sensible; That a legal conviction
must be founded on such evidence, as is agreeable to
the rules of law, and <hi>justice;</hi> and that an uncontrolable
power of judging that to be evidence, which is not so,
is equivalent to an arbitrary power of expelling men
without evidence. And therefore since there was no
other evidence of the Rector's <hi>despotick,</hi> and <hi>absolute</hi>
power, but his own allegation; since there was no cause
of the Appellant's expulsion given; and no proof of any
crime so much as offer'd, The Commissary as he was
oblig'd by Law, and Justice, reversed the Rector's inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locutory
decree; and by a desinitive sentence restored
Mr. <hi>Colmer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is evident now that the Rector had all advantages
allow'd him of justifying, or of corroborating his sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence;
That more than usual time was granted to him
for the obtaining fresh proofs; and an Extraordinary li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
was afforded him of producing them; and that, in
short, if Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi> be guilty, he ows his <hi>impunity</hi> not to
the <hi>Favour</hi> of the Bishop; but to the <hi>obstinacy</hi> of the Rector.</p>

               <p>Nothing but the concurrence of so many exorbitant
crimes, as at this time appear'd in the College, could
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:56343:12"/>
have perswaded the Bishop to Visit the College in person;
and to wave those just excuses, which his business and
indisposition of body now afforded him; It will be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
therefore, before we enter upon the Visitation it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
to give a previous account of those offences, which
occasion'd it; and to begin with that, which we cannot
name the first, nor the greatest; but which hath nearest
relation to the former discourse; and may therefore not
improperly be plac'd next to it. Assoon as Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi>
was reinstated by the Commissary; he was, immediately
after his departure again <hi>Expell'd</hi> or rather <hi>disown'd</hi> by
the Rector. The pretences and colours upon which he
now proceeded, and the management of this process
were more surprizing, even then his former conduct in
this affair. He cited Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi> to answer to a new
Charge; and at the meeting disir'd a Publick <hi>Notary</hi> to
attest; That he did not own him to be <hi>a rightful Fellow
of the said College,</hi> but a <hi>pretended</hi> Fellow; and <hi>as such,</hi>
he would proceed against him, upon farther evidence of
incontinency. Now it is not easy for a less subtile man,
than the Rector to imagine, why he should deny him to
be Fellow; and yet proceed against him. If he was
Fellow, why disavow'd? and if not, how could he fall
under his jurisdiction? The Rector's autority over him was
founded on Mr. <hi>Colmer's</hi> relation to the College; and why
should the one remain, if the other was determin'd? If
Dr. <hi>Masters</hi> proceedings were valid, why is Mr. <hi>Colmer's</hi>
right disputed; and if there was a nullity in them; why
is his present right implied, and confess'd by a subse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:56343:12"/>
Expulsion? Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi> therefore told the Rector,
that if he would not own the Sentence pass'd by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop's
Commissary he thought he had no jurisdiction over
him; There being no Statute provided for the Expulsion
of Intruders, and pretended Fellows. But if the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
would own that Sentence, he was ready to answer
to any new Charge, from which that Sentence did not
clear him. The Rector persisted to deny the Commissa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry's
autority: and upon that account only Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi>
thought it not advisable for him, nor a duty incumbent
upon him to submit to the Rector: who upon his own
Principles had no jurisdiction: and from whom there
could be no expectation of <hi>justice</hi> by what he had said, and
heretofore done. He left the Room therefore: and in his
absence, part of a Paper which the Rector had formerly
Printed, concerning Mr. <hi>Colmers</hi> Case: was read before the
Seniors: and, upon this evidence, without any witnesses
call'd, or proof given, Mr. <hi>Colmer's</hi> name was struck out
of the book: and somewhat was declar'd: either that he
<hi>now was not,</hi> or that hereafter he <hi>should not be</hi> Fellow.
And now, since we have had occasion to mention that
Paper, we should not let it go without some particular
remark: and its due Character: It is design'd for the
summ total of all the Rector's evidence, and the defence
of Mr. <hi>Colmer's</hi> Expulsion: and is wrote, with as much
prudence as the affair it-self, of which it treats, was
manag'd with as much decency, as Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi> would
wish to his adversary: and with as much truth, as we
might justly expect from a man of the Rector's principles.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:56343:13"/>
These unjustifiable proceedings carried on so rudely,
at this time, in such a manner, must be intended and
taken as direct affronts to the Visitor, and his autority.
However his Lordship's resentments were not so height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by these injuries done to himself: as by the other
scandalous offences of the Rector; which were levell'd
against his <hi>Savior.</hi> For not long before this time, an
Heretical book, entitled the <hi>Naked Gospel,</hi> was publish'd
by Dr. <hi>Bury;</hi> in which with some weak arguments, and
disagreeable mirth, The Author endeavors to confute
the divinity of <hi>Christ;</hi> and to expose it.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Godhead</hi> of our <hi>Savior</hi> (who in some places is
nam'd a <hi>Crucified Vagabond</hi>) is declar'd to be a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
and impertinent Speculation, and (to speak in
this Author's <hi>Idiom</hi>) a <hi>silly Qnestion,</hi> and a <hi>Push-pin point.</hi>
The Fundamental Articles of our Faith are there stil'd
<hi>Gross impositions;</hi> and matters of no <hi>certainty,</hi> nor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
of <hi>credibility.</hi> The Council of <hi>Nice</hi> is by him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
as an <hi>ignorant,</hi> and <hi>Partial Synod;</hi> and the
Decrees of it such, as were made according to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
of Parties, not the merits of the Cause. His way
of reasoning is much like that, when heretofore he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to sole, unqualified, and incommunicable power
from the words in the College Statutes: <hi>sit unus Rector;</hi>
tho' in other places the officers and seniors have a joynt
autority; and are Commissioners with him. In short,
all the absur'd and desperate opinions of the <hi>Anti-Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitarians
abroad</hi> are here <hi>repeated,</hi> and <hi>avow'd:</hi> all the
old misapply'd citations, of which the more learned
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:56343:13"/>
                  <hi>Arians</hi> are now asham'd, are here reviv'd and enforc'd;
and indeed the whole <hi>System</hi> of the <hi>Socinian</hi> doctrine
is by this <hi>Plagiary</hi> transcrib'd, and made his own
with the new additions only of worse language,
and less decency. This book the Rector, being then
<hi>Pro-Vice-Chancellor</hi> of <hi>Oxford,</hi> carried to the Press; and,
by the autority of his Character prevail'd with the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to print it without any other licence. Assoon as
it was finish'd; he dispers'd it to some Friends; and
intended, as he himself since professes, to have <hi>presented
it to Convocation.</hi> But when his Friends had dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
him from so dangerous an attempt; He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd
in a second Edition to mollify some harsh ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions,
to carry on the <hi>same</hi> design with <hi>more</hi> cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning;
and to give as great a stroke to the Divinity of
<hi>Christ,</hi> with more security to himself. Thus this <hi>Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous
Treatise,</hi> with some few variations, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
alter'd for the better, more often for the
worse, was publish'd by him, and his confident <hi>Sir
Kingston,</hi> with more openness, and assurance than the
former.</p>
               <p>It was time now for the Bishop to be mindful
of those earnest entreaties and prayers, by which
the Founders of that College have adjur'd him to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the <hi>Christian Faith</hi> in it. He foresaw the sad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences,
which must necessarily ensue if Dr. <hi>Bury,</hi> were
permitted, in such a Station, by the power of his <hi>irresistible
autority,</hi> to publish such doctrines; and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force
them. This book of the Rector's was not more
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:56343:14"/>
complain'd of to the Visitor, than his <hi>life;</hi> and his <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals</hi>
discredited the College as much as his <hi>Speculations.</hi>
He openly sold the offices and places of the College;
and consequently the Collegiates were expos'd to the
impositions of those, who had <hi>purchas'd a right</hi> of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauding
them. His Chastity was said to be so notorious;
that he seem'd to have other designs in Expelling Mr. <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi>
than the punishment of <hi>Vice;</hi> and to have acted more
like a <hi>Rival,</hi> than a <hi>Judge.</hi> His indifference to order in
the Chappel; His neglect of discipline in the House; His
not maintaining of Lectures, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> made the whole College,
as far as in him lay, one continued disorder. So that the
Dissentions of the Fellows upon these arbitrary proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
grew high; and, without the interposing care of the
<hi>Visitor,</hi> there was no prospect of quiet, and agreement. It
was easy now to foresee, that nothing could put a stop to the
approaching ruine of the College, but a <hi>Visitation:</hi> no other
way was left of reforming these <hi>Enormities;</hi> or of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
these <hi>Divisions;</hi> no other method could prevent
the change of this <hi>Nursery</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> into a <hi>Seminary</hi> of
<hi>Socinianism;</hi> and therefore his Lordship was resolv'd to
discharge the great trust, which was happily repos'd in
him: and so far to imitate his Noble Predecessor, who
had at great expences founded that College, as to exempt
him-self from no trouble, or charge, in <hi>reforming,</hi> and
<hi>preserving it.</hi>

               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:56343:14"/>
               <head>4. Concerning the Visitation it self, the Evidence there
given, and the Sentence there pronounc'd.</head>
               <p>HItherto, in all the former proceedings, no other
power was allow'd to his Lordship by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor,
but a <hi>General Visitation:</hi> The Universal auto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
which the Statutes repose in him, was accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his interpretation, wholly resolv'd into a
<hi>Quinquennial Enquiry:</hi> and all the General words,
which give Latitude, and full Extent to his power,
were pretended to have reference to no other, than <hi>this
Jurisdiction.</hi> His Lordship therfore being willing to
reform the College not only by <hi>Legal,</hi> but <hi>Unexcepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable</hi>
methods, appointed the 16 of <hi>June</hi> 1690. for
the day of his <hi>Solemn</hi> and <hi>General Visitation</hi> to be
held in the Chappel, and serv'd the College with a
previous Citation in order to it. Now was it hardly
to be expected, that the exercise of this unquestionable
power, which had always been own'd and confess'd,
could afford any colour of dispute, even to those, who
always thought it more wisdom to put of their own
<hi>Tryal,</hi> than to make their <hi>Defence.</hi> And yet, when
the Bishop went in Person to the Chappel; where the
<hi>Rector,</hi> and <hi>Fellows</hi> had been cited to appear, he found
the doores designedly shut against him. <hi>Nine</hi> of
the <hi>Fellows,</hi> indeed who were sensible of the <hi>Rector's</hi>
Arbitrary proceedings, and of the <hi>Bishop's</hi> undoubted
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:56343:15"/>
Autority, attended his Lordship, and own'd his Visita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torial
power. But the Rector and some Fellows with
him appear'd; and in a very tumultuous manner in
the open Quadrangle offer'd a Protestation against
his Autority; and would not permit him to have any
entrance into the Chappel; which was the proper
place for them to tender the Protestation, and for him
to receive it. Other indignities and disrespects were
then offer'd to his Lordship, which, by his order, I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare
to report; even the indecent behaviour of <hi>Sir Kingston,</hi>
which deserves a particular mention, but that
it would force such reflections, as I make it my bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness
to avoyd.</p>
               <p>The substance of their Protestation was this, that the
<hi>Bishop's</hi> power of <hi>Visitation</hi> is not general, but limited
and restrain'd to once in 5 Years, that Dr. <hi>Masters</hi>
by a Commission from the Bishop lately exercis'd acts
of Jurisdiction, and Visitation in the College, in restoring
an expelled Fellow; and that therefore within the
term of 5 Years, which was not yet expir'd, his <hi>Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi>
was barr'd from any other <hi>Visitation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Argument or rather Cavil is so very weak in it
self; and supported by so little colour of reason, that
it is necessary to beg the Reader's pardon for troubling
him with a solid confutation of it: For it is evident,
beyond dispute, That</p>
               <p>1. The Nature and being of a <hi>Court</hi> can be no other,
than what is granted in the <hi>Commission,</hi> on which it
depends: and therefore since the <hi>Commission,</hi> which
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:56343:15"/>
is here annex'd, is restrain'd to the <hi>Cause</hi> of <hi>Appeal</hi> only,
the acts of the <hi>Commissary</hi> were, and must be agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to it, and are null in themselves, if they exceed
those restrictions.</p>
               <p>2 The nature of a <hi>Visitation</hi> is a voluntary enquiry
into matters criminal, and correction therupon; But
the Matter transacted by Dr. <hi>Masters</hi> was a <hi>nude Cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition</hi>
of a <hi>grievance</hi> done to a certain Person, at his
<hi>instance,</hi> and ended in <hi>Restitution</hi> only.</p>
               <p>3 The nature of a <hi>Visitation</hi> of a <hi>College</hi> requires it
to be general, both as to <hi>Crimes,</hi> and <hi>Persons;</hi> But to
this Court were call'd those <hi>Persons</hi> alone, who had
been partakers in the <hi>personal wrong.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4 The Commissioner openly declar'd; that he did
not then come upon a Visitation; and therefore refused
the <hi>Sportulage,</hi> in that Case appointed by the Founder.</p>
               <p>5. The Rector, who gives a new autority to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missary,
<hi>when gone,</hi> Protested against him, <hi>when pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent;</hi>
The Judicial Acts, that he did, were neither own'd
nor observ'd; and the <hi>Process</hi> upon the <hi>Appeal,</hi> which
is now say'd to be a <hi>Visitation,</hi> was then pretended by
the same Man to have been <hi>invalid,</hi> and <hi>null.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Visitor therefore esteeming the injury, and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences
offered to him, as an invasion of the Prerogative
(the Visitatorial power being first deriv'd from, and
confirm'd by the Crown) apply'd himself by Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to their Majesties in Council.</p>
               <p>The application to Council in things of this Nature
hath allways been warranted by Custom; the Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:56343:16"/>
of their <hi>final decision,</hi> or <hi>arbitration</hi> are not few,
and their orders have usually by <hi>mutual consent</hi> of
both Parties been obey'd. But now the <hi>Rector</hi> openly
declar'd that he would not acquiesce in their deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
of the affair, nor be concluded by it: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
upon notice of this, or whether their <hi>Lordships</hi>
did not take <hi>this Cause</hi> to fall under their <hi>Cognizance,</hi>
or upon any other motives (which being things <hi>secret</hi>
and <hi>uncertain</hi> it is not proper to enquire into) Their
Lordships thought fit <hi>wholly</hi> to dismiss this Cause <hi>from
that Board;</hi> and to refer the Visitor to the <hi>usual course
of Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Bishop</hi> finding himself left to the methods of
<hi>Law,</hi> again took the advice of the most learned Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
in the <hi>Laws, both Common, and Civil,</hi> and was by
them satisfy'd in these three points; which in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent
discourse have been stated, and setled,</p>
               <p>1. That he, <hi>as Ordinary,</hi> had power of receiving,
and determining Appeals.</p>
               <p>2. That the Commission made to his Commissary
was only a <hi>Commission of Appeal</hi> restrain'd to the
hearing and determining of the cause of that appellant
only.</p>
               <p>3. That being constituted by the Statutes <hi>Visitor</hi>
and empowr'd <hi>without requisition</hi> to visit once in five
Years; and the execution of that <hi>Commission</hi> not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a <hi>Visitation,</hi> the <hi>Bishop</hi> might <hi>Visit,</hi> assoon as he
thought fit.</p>
               <p>His Lorship being thus confirm'd in his opinion,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:56343:16"/>
went down to <hi>Oxford</hi> in his way to his <hi>Diocess,</hi> with
a resolution to Visit; but to deferr his Visitation, till
the meeting of the <hi>Parliament</hi> should oblige him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to <hi>London.</hi> During his stay the <hi>Rector</hi> convening all
the <hi>Fellows</hi> in an insulting manner told them, that he
had defeated the Bishop's design of Visitation; and <hi>had
thrown him flat on his back;</hi> farther adding to that part
of them who had submitted to the Visitor, that tho' he
had power to expell them, yet now he would only <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gister</hi>
them: But they were not to look on this as a <hi>Pardon,</hi>
but as a <hi>Reprieve;</hi> For that they should continue at his
<hi>Mercy,</hi> and removable at his <hi>Will.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereupon, Complaint of these <hi>Arbitrary</hi> proceedings
being made to his Lordship, then at <hi>Christ-Church;</hi> He
being sensible, that inevitable ruin to the College must fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
if some speedy stop was not put to the Rector's <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitant</hi>
designs, resolv'd immediately to proceed to a
Visitation, and serv'd a <hi>Citation</hi> on the Rector, and Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
(being then in Town) to appear after some few days
in the College <hi>Hall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At the day appointed, two hours earlier, than usual,
the Rector order'd the College prayers to be said, and
after the end of them, instead of opening the gates, as
he ought, he order'd them to be more firmly barr'd, and
secur'd; resolving, as he had before kept the Bishop out
of the <hi>Chappel,</hi> now to double his <hi>rudeness,</hi> and shut him
out of the <hi>College.</hi> The Bishop knowing his temper, and
apprehending such usage from him, resolv'd (as he had
been before by his Councill advis'd) to have kept the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:56343:17"/>
Visitation as near the College as conveniently he could;
but hearing afterwards that the Doors of the College
were open'd; and that a great uproar was occasion'd
thereby; he went with all convenient speed to put an
end to the confusion; and to proceed, as quietly as might
be in the Visitation.</p>
               <p>How the Gates were open'd, or by whom, the Bishop
knows not; and less can he understand, by what colour
of <hi>Law,</hi> at that time, they were shut up. But probable
it is, since the Gates were open'd from the <hi>College side,</hi>
that some of the Fellows finding themselves unstatutably
confin'd by the Rector, and having no prospect of liberty
within the three days appointed for the Visitation, thought
fit to free themselves from an illegal and arbitrary <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment.</hi>
And if any tumult happen'd on that account,
the guilt of it must certainly lye on those, who by their
unjustifiable act first occasion'd it; and afterwards, by
their rude, and violent <hi>interposition,</hi> promoted it.</p>
               <p>As soon as the Bishop came into the <hi>Hall,</hi> the Rector
with like <hi>rudeness,</hi> as formerly, threw in the former <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation</hi>
against the Bishop's <hi>Jurisdiction.</hi> The Bishop
however permitted that the Protestation should be read,
(as far as the <hi>Fellow,</hi> that accompany'd the Rector,
<hi>could read it,</hi>) and upon the Rector's desire, promised
that it should be entred in the <hi>Register.</hi> His Lordship
farther desired the Rector to sit down, who return'd this
answer only to the Civility: <hi>No I will stand</hi> by <hi>what I
doe.</hi> After this indecent language, in a Contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
manner, He went out of the <hi>Hall;</hi> and refus'd
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:56343:17"/>
to attend the Visitation; or indeed, the <hi>Issue</hi> of his own
<hi>Plea.</hi> Now however a <hi>Plea</hi> to a <hi>Jurisdiction</hi> may exalt a
man against him who hath no <hi>Jurisdiction</hi> at all; yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
a <hi>known Ordinary Judge</hi> in case he should seem
to intermeddle beyond his Jurisdiction, great <hi>Temper,</hi>
and <hi>Reverence</hi> is to be us'd; the matter is to be debated
<hi>before him;</hi> and his judgment is to govern the question
<hi>till farther Appeal.</hi> With all which the shutting up the
<hi>Chappel Doore</hi> at one time, and the <hi>College-Gates</hi> at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
the flinging in a <hi>Protestation,</hi> and rudely reced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
without expecting the Success of it, are very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent:
a defence, cloath'd with <hi>these</hi> circumstances,
is so far from tempering the <hi>Contempt,</hi> that is adds
thereto Enmity to the <hi>Judge,</hi> and despight to the <hi>Law;</hi>
than which there can be no greater aggravations.</p>
               <p>However his Lordship without taking notice, or advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of these <hi>indecencies,</hi> order'd the <hi>Protestation</hi> to be
read throughout; and <hi>Proclamation</hi> to be <hi>thrice</hi> made for
the <hi>Rector</hi> and <hi>protesting Fellows</hi> to appear; and to jus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify
their <hi>protestation;</hi> and to hear his Lordship's Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
therein: but when none would answer, tho divers
of the <hi>protesting</hi> Fellows were present; he observ'd the
usual forms of process; and proceeded on regularly in
the business of his Visitation. The <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>Enquiry</hi>
were read; and the Bishop, as by Statute directed, gave
an <hi>Oath</hi> to such of the Fellows, as own'd his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship's
Authority; and oblig'd them to discover to him
such <hi>Enormities</hi> in the College, as by publick fame, or
otherwise should come to their knowledg. It is not
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:56343:18"/>
thought convenient, nor is it consistent with Statute, to
discover the names of those that detected each <hi>crime;</hi>
But in General the returns upon Oath to the <hi>Interroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
were these;</p>
               <p>1. That the <hi>Rector</hi> was the reputed <hi>Author</hi> of a Book,
call'd the <hi>Naked Gospell;</hi> that he sat at S. <hi>Athanasius</hi>'s
<hi>Creed</hi> in the Chappel; that he was generally suspected
of <hi>Heresy;</hi> and did not read <hi>Prayers</hi> in the Chappel as
often, as by Statute he was oblig'd</p>
               <p>2. That he pretended to an <hi>Arbitrary,</hi> power over the
Fellows; and had put some of them out of <hi>Commons</hi> for
obeying the <hi>Inhibition</hi> of the <hi>Visitor</hi> in Mr. <hi>Colmer's</hi>
Case.</p>
               <p>3. That he had sold <hi>Places</hi> and <hi>Offices</hi> in the College,
particularly those of the <hi>Cook,</hi> and <hi>Butler;</hi> and propos'd
the Illegal Exaction of <hi>Bonds</hi> from the <hi>Fellows,</hi> who
should thereafter be Elected, whereby they should engage
to seek no reparation if he expell'd 'em.</p>
               <p>4. That he was by publick <hi>Fame,</hi> upon probable
grounds suspected of <hi>Incontinence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. That Dr. <hi>Hern,</hi> having a <hi>Parsonage,</hi> above the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
limited in the Statute; kept his place, contrary to
the intent of the <hi>Founder.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. That Mr. <hi>Vivian</hi> was Elected into Mr. <hi>Colmer's</hi> place
being then full.</p>
               <p>7. And lastly: That <hi>Divinity Disputations</hi> were seldom
held: the <hi>Philosophical Lectures</hi> perform'd by <hi>Deputies;</hi>
the <hi>Catechist's</hi> Duty not observ'd; and in short, the
whole <hi>Discipline</hi> of the College neglected.</p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:56343:18"/>
               <p>The <hi>Visitor</hi> seeing the <hi>Rector</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nd others charg'd
with some of these Crimes upon Oath, and suspected of
others, called them again in Court to answer to these
Accusations: and when they could not be brought
to appear, his <hi>Lordship</hi> thought fit, not to punish the
contempt of the <hi>Rector</hi> till he had taken all farther just,
and legal methods of detecting the Crime, and expected
his submission and innocence to the last day. In the
mean time his <hi>Lordship</hi> found, that some of the <hi>Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,</hi>
who factiously abetted Dr. <hi>Bury</hi> in these his arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
proceedings could not be brought to appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him, and to own his power: this great, and repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
contempt met with no other punishment than a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spension
<hi>ab Officio &amp; Beneficio,</hi> for three Months, and
farther, till they should be brought to own his <hi>Autori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi>
And since <hi>Sir Kingston,</hi> the Person who had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
rudely affronted the Bishop, immediately upon his
Suspension, the same day, exercised his <hi>Office</hi> in the
Chappel, upon the doors whereof the Sentence had been
affix'd; the Bishop according to the direction of the
Statutes, upon so great a contempt, heightened with
so many aggravations, thought fit, to <hi>Excommunicate
him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The substance of the Evidence, which was taken be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his <hi>Lordship,</hi> and upon which his Sentences were
grounded, was in short this which followeth. As to
Dr. <hi>Hern,</hi> it appear'd by the Register of the Lord Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of <hi>London;</hi> That he was Admitted and Collated
to the Parish of St. <hi>Anns 1 Apr.</hi> 1686. and upon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:56343:19"/>
of the Statute of the <hi>College,</hi> with the Act of
<hi>Parliament</hi> relating to the Rector of that <hi>Parish;</hi> it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd,
that such maintenance was by the Act setled,
and such residence enjoyn'd, as is wholly incompatible
with his Fellowship. The Condition of his <hi>Parsonage</hi> is,
that he shall reside upon it four parts of five in the Year;
and the Condition of his Fellowship is, that he shall not
be absent from the College above fifty days. All livings
rated above 8 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> in <hi>any publick Records</hi> are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent
with a Fellowship; and upon this, <hi>100l.</hi> are
setled <hi>by Act of Parliament:</hi> besides several <hi>rents,</hi> and
other <hi>perquisites.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Hern,</hi> by this direct clear, and <hi>authentick</hi> Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
had no right to his Fellowship; and by his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
acts in matters of the like nature, had no <hi>Plea</hi>
for favour: He having been instituted at one time, to
<hi>Blandford,</hi> and at another time to the Rectory of <hi>Hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
in <hi>Dorset-shire,</hi> took occasion still to keep himself
free from the danger of the Statute; by a resignation
at Eleven month's end; and thus, by observing the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the <hi>Law,</hi> eluded the design of the <hi>Legislator.</hi>
The Rector had often openly threatned him with Expul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
on these accounts; but he knew the methods, that
would pacify this <hi>Governour,</hi> and was careful to prevent,
at least to appease his <hi>Indignation.</hi> The Visitor saw
therefore that it was a <hi>Crime</hi> of the Rector and the
College, not to have declar'd his palce void long since;
and therefore, now at last took away that <hi>Scandal</hi> from
the College by removing him.</p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:56343:19"/>
               <p>Concerning Mr. <hi>Vivian,</hi> it appear'd that he had been
elected into Mr. <hi>Colmer's</hi> place; which was never void:
since Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi> was not then Statutably Expell'd; and
the business of his Appeal was at the time of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
depending before the Visitor. And since Mr. <hi>Colmer,</hi>
now appear'd, and was ready to answer to what
ever could be alleged against him, and neither in the detections of the <hi>Fellows,</hi> nor otherwise was charg'd
with suspicion of <hi>Incontinence;</hi> and by the Oath of two
Persons, that appear'd in Court, was acquitted from the
former Accusations, the <hi>Visitor</hi> could find no cause to
displace or expell him.</p>
               <p>And lastly as to the <hi>Rector, Litchfield</hi> the Printer of the
<hi>Naked Gospel,</hi> came into Court, &amp; attested upon Oath, that
he receiv'd that <hi>Heretical</hi> Book from <hi>his</hi> hands; and was
Authoriz'd by him, being then <hi>Pro Vice-Chancellour,</hi> to
print it. It was swore that the former <hi>Cook,</hi> and present
<hi>Butler</hi> gave <hi>him,</hi> one 150 <hi>l.</hi> the other <hi>170l.</hi> for their Places;
and the <hi>Bond</hi> it-self for the Payment of the Mony with
the Rector's <hi>Receipt</hi> in his own hand on the back of it was
brought into Court. Concerning the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. <hi>Article,</hi> three
<hi>Affidavits</hi> were taken, which out of respect to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor's
<hi>Character,</hi> it is thought fit at present to conceal.</p>
               <p>His Lordship was now fully satisfi'd, that it was not
consistent with the <hi>interest</hi> of the College, the <hi>reputation</hi>
of the <hi>Vniversity,</hi> or the <hi>pious</hi> design of the <hi>Founder;</hi>
to permit the Rector, any longer to maintain such a
<hi>Station,</hi> as he now had in the College, and <hi>Vniversity.</hi>
His Lordship therefore found himself oblig'd to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:56343:20"/>
him, which he resolv'd to doe confining himself
strictly to those methods, which the Statutes direct in the
deprivation of a <hi>Rector.</hi> And therefore, since there are
some words in the Statute that seem to desire, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
to the Visitor a concurrent <hi>Vote</hi> of the Majority
of the Seven <hi>Senior</hi> Fellows there present, to strengthen,
and confirm his Act of <hi>Deprivation,</hi> the Visitor took the
consent of Four of them accordingly; whose names are
subscrib'd to the <hi>Instrument</hi> hereafter annexed. If excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
be taken by any, to the Persons concurring, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not really the Seven <hi>Seniours</hi> of the College; they
may know that the Bishop was satisfi'd, that the Statute
was sufficiently observ'd in the concurrence of those that
subscrib'd to the <hi>Deprivation.</hi> For</p>
               <p>1. The Statute by <hi>maxime Seniores</hi> rather <hi>directs</hi> than
commands the Concurrence of the <hi>Seniors.</hi> The <hi>Founder</hi>
requires indeed the consent of <hi>Four</hi> Fellows; but he wishes
only, that if it be possible, those Fellows, that consent
may be the <hi>Seniors.</hi> Neither were those the very <hi>Seniors</hi>
that Expell'd Mr. <hi>Colmer,</hi> but only the <hi>Seniors</hi> present.</p>
               <p>2 The constant usage in this and all Colleges inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prets
those words of the Statute. The concurrence of
<hi>Seniors</hi> to all publick Acts, is always understood to mean
the consent of those that are (not absolutely and truly
the <hi>Seniors</hi> of the College, but) the most <hi>Senior</hi> of those
that <hi>are present;</hi> and he, that by his own crime, <hi>incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citates</hi>
himself from performing any Acts of his place, is
by the rules of <hi>Law,</hi> and <hi>Reason,</hi> reputed as <hi>absent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. It would be absurd in expelling a <hi>Rector</hi> to require
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:56343:20"/>
the Consent of those Fellows who are <hi>participes cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minis;</hi>
and are by the Visitor him-self, upon that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
already <hi>suspended ab Officio,</hi> as well as, <hi>a beneficio;</hi>
and so made incapable of giving any legal concurrence.</p>
               <p>His <hi>Lordship</hi> having thus according to <hi>Law</hi> depriv'd
the <hi>Rector,</hi> knew how little submission was to be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from him; and therefore thought it necessary to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force
his <hi>Sentence.</hi> The only Method of doing it was
such, as the Statute directed; and since in Cases of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinacy,
<hi>Censures</hi> are there expresly prescrib'd, by which
must be meant <hi>Ecclesiastical Censures</hi> (this, as all other Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges
in <hi>Oxford</hi> being exempted from <hi>Episcopal</hi> and <hi>Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>political</hi>
Jurisdiction; and immediately subject to the <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clestastical</hi>
Jurisdiction of the Visitor thereof, if he be a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<hi>Competent</hi> and <hi>fit</hi> to Exercise such Autority) the Bishop
as Ordinary, thought convenient to give the <hi>Rector</hi> Seven
days after <hi>monition</hi> for his removal; and in Case of far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Contumacy,</hi> pronounced him <hi>Excommunicate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The account of the Visitation being thus given it may
not be immaterial to add; that upon his Deprivation,
such of the Fellows of <hi>Exeter</hi> College, as were capable,
according to the order appointed in the Statutes, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
to the Election of a <hi>New</hi> Rector; and Unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously
chose Mr. <hi>Painter,</hi> a person of unexceptionable
worth and integrity.</p>
               <p>And lastly, for the Honour of the <hi>Vniversity</hi> of <hi>Oxford,</hi>
it must not be omitted, that immediately afther this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scovery
of the Author of the <hi>Naked Gospell,</hi> which was
made by his <hi>Lordship;</hi> The <hi>Vniversity,</hi> being now sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:56343:21"/>
of the place, where the book was Printed, and of
the Author himself, who had perfidiously us'd the colour
of their autority in publication of it, by a solemn <hi>Decree</hi>
condemn'd that <hi>Heretical book,</hi> and particularly seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
propositions therein contain'd; and order'd it to be
publickly burnt in the <hi>Schools.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus have we now given a full account of an <hi>intricate</hi>
Cause; <hi>intricate</hi> only, as designedly perplex'd by those,
who, being afraid of the <hi>Sentence</hi> have disputed every
step of the <hi>process.</hi> And indeed, if we look back, and
take a review of the whole Cause, it will be easy to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
That, the strength of the Adversaries consists more
in the <hi>number</hi> of their <hi>Cavils,</hi> than in the <hi>force</hi> of them.
For first is it not evident, that by Law, and the Statutes
of the College, no man ought to be devested of his <hi>Free-hold</hi>
without <hi>legal conviction?</hi> Was there any <hi>concludent
circumstance,</hi> in Mr. <hi>Colmer's</hi> Case alleg'd, upon which he
could be legally convicted? at least was there any proof
of such <hi>allegation?</hi> If we let in the supplemental evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
which was taken after the <hi>Sentence,</hi> and therefore
cannot in <hi>equity, justify,</hi> or <hi>support</hi> it; <hi>even in that,</hi> there
is hardly ground for <hi>jealousy,</hi> much less for <hi>certainty.</hi>
Where the same man is <hi>Accuser, sole Witness,</hi> and <hi>Judge,</hi>
are not the proceedings, if not <hi>null,</hi> yet at least, justly
<hi>suspected?</hi> And, where there is ground of suspicion ought
not the <hi>Ordinary</hi> to admit an <hi>appeal,</hi> and to allow a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearing?
If there was not therefore such proof, nor such
legal process against Mr. <hi>Colmer,</hi> as the Statute requir'd;
it is evident, from the Statute it-self, that he is not
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:56343:21"/>
barr'd from <hi>appeal.</hi> 'Tis apparent it was not the design
of the <hi>Founder</hi> to make the Rector <hi>absolute,</hi> and <hi>uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trollable;</hi>
and to set up a Court in <hi>his breast,</hi> from
which <hi>no writ of Error,</hi> or <hi>appeal</hi> should ly. At least,
it is not easy to imagine why Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi> should be more
forsworn for appealing, than the <hi>late Rector</hi> now is:
Both were expell'd by <hi>competent Judges;</hi> both are <hi>equally</hi>
barr'd from <hi>appeal;</hi> and the only difference between
them is, that there are legal proofs against the latter,
but not against the former. If therefore an <hi>appeal</hi> is
to be admitted, who but the <hi>Ordinary</hi> is the Proper
<hi>judge</hi> of it? and what application upon such grievances
hath ever been made to any other, than the Visitor?
In all other Colleges, where the Visitors are restrain'd
from the frequency of <hi>solemn,</hi> and <hi>chargeable</hi> Visitations;
the power of receiving <hi>appeals</hi> oftner, has either not been
disputed, or upon dispute, adjudg'd to them, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.
Extraordinary emergencies have always been
allow'd to have speedy remedies; nor is it reasonable,
that no redress should be obtain'd, till either the grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
be of five <hi>Years standing,</hi> or till the <hi>parties obnoxious
desire</hi> a Visitation. If the Rector, and the majority of
the seaven <hi>Seniors,</hi> spend the revenues of the College, and
commit <hi>dilapidations;</hi> can there no stop be put to the
exorbitance till the <hi>Quinquennial</hi> term is expir'd? And
is not the College to be <hi>visited,</hi> till it shall be wholly <hi>ruin'd?</hi>
The Bishop <hi>then had power</hi> of receiving <hi>appeals;</hi> and as
there never was a greater necessity for the exercise of that
<hi>power</hi> than in this instance, so was there never more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:56343:22"/>
us'd in the <hi>acts</hi> of it. What interest could the
Bishop of <hi>Exeter</hi> have in this Cause, but the performance
of <hi>Justice?</hi> and what design could the Rector have in not
producing his former proofs, but the establishment of
an arbitrary and uncontrollable jurisdiction in <hi>him-self?</hi>
It is plain then, that the Commission of <hi>appeal</hi> was upon
<hi>just motives legally</hi> granted; and is no less evident, that
it was wholly restrain'd to the <hi>matter</hi> of the <hi>Appeal.</hi> What
right had Dr. <hi>Masters</hi> to Visit <hi>Exeter-College,</hi> but by a
Deputation from the Bishop? And how can the Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
appear, but by the Commission? If there be no
Commission then that enables him to <hi>Visit;</hi> if the <hi>powers</hi>
given in the Commission of <hi>Appeal</hi> are not <hi>General,</hi> but
subject to restrictions, and <hi>determin'd:</hi> it shall be allow'd
that the Commissary <hi>did</hi> make a Visitation, if it can be
prov'd, that he <hi>could</hi> make any. The Commissary, acting
by a limited Commission, confin'd him-self strictly to the
bounds of it; but if he did not; his acts, as supported
by no autority, were <hi>null</hi> and <hi>invalid;</hi> and as they could
not affect the College, so neither could they prejudice
the Bishop's right to a future Visitation. If the Restitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Mr. <hi>Colmer</hi> was such a judicial Act, as a Visitor
only can exercise; and if Dr. <hi>Masters</hi> had power of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitation;
why was it protested against as a <hi>null</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>autoritative
act?</hi>
and why was it never admitted to be
of any force by the <hi>Rector,</hi> till it was pleaded, as a
barr to the Jurisdiction of the <hi>Visitor?</hi> Since therefore
Dr. <hi>Masters</hi> did not <hi>Visit,</hi> the <hi>Bishop</hi> was not now restrain'd
from his right of Visitation; and if he had right of being
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:56343:22"/>
                  <hi>Judge,</hi> there is none, even of the <hi>Rector's Friends,</hi> that
can dispute the equity of the <hi>Sentence. Bribery, Heresy,</hi>
and <hi>Incontinence,</hi> clearly made out, and prov'd, are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
sufficient to make a Governor of a College, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
of that Station. And now if the Sentence of
Deprivation was rightly inflicted; it was necessary, that
all legal Methods should be us'd, which could enforce
that <hi>Sentence.</hi> And since the Founder had directed the
<hi>Visitor,</hi> who was always to be a Bishop, to the use of
Ecclesiastical Censures; Excommunication was the last
and only remedy, whereby the <hi>late Rector</hi> could be
oblig'd to Submission.</p>
               <p>It is clear then, that as his Lordship's <hi>designs</hi> were
<hi>honourable</hi> and <hi>just;</hi> so his <hi>Methods</hi> of pursuing them
have been <hi>Statutable</hi> and <hi>legal;</hi> and that the justice of
his <hi>Sentence</hi> doth not more plainly appear than the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality
of his <hi>Process.</hi> It is clear at last, That <hi>the
late Rector's</hi> arguments in <hi>Law,</hi> are as bad, as those
which he uses in <hi>Divinity;</hi> and that his <hi>Plea</hi> is no more
true, than his <hi>Gospel.</hi>
