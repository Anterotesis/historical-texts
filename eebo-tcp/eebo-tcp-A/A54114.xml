            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>AWake, O <hi>Chriſtendom!</hi> Awake, and come to Judgment, for the <hi>Great</hi> and <hi>Notable Day</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> is drawing apace upon thee; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare to meet him, thou and thy Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, for the Hour of his <hi>Judgement</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteneth upon you, as Travail on a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man with Child, in which all your <hi>Works</hi> ſhall be tried, and that by <hi>Fire,</hi> For <hi>the Day of the</hi> Lord <hi>ſhall burn as an Oven, and all the proud, and all that do wickedly, ſhall be as ſtubble.</hi> Yea, <hi>by fire and by ſword will the Lord God Almighty

plead with all fleſh</hi>; with all fleſhly Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers and Workers, who live after the fleſh, to fulfil the luſts thereof: And with the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Judgment,</hi> and the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Burning,</hi> that is, with Spiritual <hi>Judgment</hi> and <hi>Burning</hi> will he viſit all Ranks and Regions upon the Earth: Yea, his holy <hi>Terrors</hi> ſhall take hold of the <hi>Rebellious,</hi> and Anguiſh and Diſtreſs ſhall fill the Souls of the Guilty. The Faces of Nations ſhall gather paleneſs, and their Knees ſmite together, becauſe of the Anger of <hi>God,</hi> that is kindling againſt them, and his fierce Wrath, that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing from Heaven againſt all the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly; but more eſpecially againſt the Children of the <hi>Myſtery</hi> of <hi>Iniquity</hi>: 'Tis in this day, that the Kindreds of the Earth ſhall mourn with a great Lamentation.</p>
            <p>O <hi>Chriſtendom!</hi> Thou haſt long ſate as a <hi>Queen,</hi> that ſhould never know ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; <hi>Great have been thy Pretences, and large thy Profeſſion of God, Chriſt, Spirit</hi> and <hi>Scriptures</hi>; come, let me Expoſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late with thee and thy <hi>Children</hi> in the fear and preſence of him, that ſhall bring every <hi>word</hi> and <hi>work</hi> to Judgment. <hi>God is pure,</hi> and <hi>the pure in heart only ſee him:</hi>

and conſider my words; for behold, what I have to ſay unto you, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth your Eternal Good.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>GOD hath ſo loved the World,</hi> that he hath ſent his only Begotten <hi>Son</hi> into the World, that thoſe that believe in him, ſhould have Eternal Life. And this <hi>Son</hi> is <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> the true <hi>Light, that light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth every one coming into the World</hi>; and they that abide not in him the <hi>Light,</hi> dwell in <hi>Darkneſs,</hi> in <hi>Sin,</hi> and are under the Region and Shadow of Death: Yea <hi>dead</hi> in <hi>Sin,</hi> and ſee not their own ſtates, neither perceive the ſad Conditions of their own Souls. They are blind to the things of God's Kingdom, and unſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of true and ſpiritual <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Motion,</hi> what it is, to live to God: And in that ſtate are alienated from God, without true Judgment and living Knowledge; and under the Curſe. For in Jeſus Chriſt, the <hi>Light</hi> of the <hi>World,</hi> are hid all the Treaſures of Wiſdom and Knowledge, Redemption and Glory; they are hid from the <hi>wordly Chriſtian,</hi> from all that are captivated by the Spirit and Luſts of the World: And whoever would ſee them, (for therein conſiſt the things,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57182:4"/>
that belong to their Eternal Peace) muſt come to Chriſt Jeſus, the true <hi>Light</hi> in their <hi>Conſciences,</hi> bring their Deeds to him, love him and obey him; whom God hath ordained <hi>a Light to lighten the Gentiles, and for his Salvation to the ends of the Earth. Light</hi> and <hi>Salvation</hi> are joined together; and none can come to Salvation, but as they come firſt to the Light, and ſubmit to the manifestation of it, which leadeth to Salvation. For <hi>the Nations of them that are ſaved, ſhall walk in the Light of the Lamb,</hi> Chriſt Jeſus. <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Sanctification</hi> are alſo joined to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: <hi>If we walk in the Light, as God is in the Light, the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt his Son ſhall cleanſe us from all ſin.</hi> And <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Life Eternal</hi> are joined together: <hi>For in the Word</hi> (that was with God in the beginning, and was God, by whom <hi>all things</hi> were made, that were made) <hi>was life, and that life the light of men.</hi> And this is the Teſtimony of Jeſus, <hi>I am the light of the world; he that followeth me, ſhall not abide in darkneſs, but have the light of life:</hi> Yea, it is <hi>Eternal Life</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him, in Chriſt the <hi>Light,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, embrace, and to follow him. And
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:57182:5"/>
               <hi>this is that true Light</hi> (ſaith the ſame be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Diſciple) <hi>that lighteth every man, that cometh into the world.</hi> Now this <hi>Light</hi> ſhineth in <hi>Darkneſs,</hi> in the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Darkneſs, in their dark Hearts, in their black Souls, and defiled Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences; but in this <hi>Darkneſs</hi> they compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend it not. Neither can man know the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Benefit</hi> of it, whilſt he rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth againſt it; for the Virtue and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of it is ſhut up and hid from the <hi>Children</hi> of <hi>Diſobedience.</hi> To as many as received him of old, gave he power to become the <hi>Children</hi> of <hi>God</hi>; and they that did his Will, knew his Doctrine to be of God, and of Power and Efficacy to their Salvation.</p>
            <p>But this is the great <hi>Condemnation</hi> of the <hi>World</hi> at this day, that though <hi>God</hi> hath ſent his <hi>Son</hi> a <hi>Light</hi> into the Hearts of all Men and Women, to manifeſt and reprove their evil deeds, and to ſave them; yet they love <hi>Darkneſs,</hi> they love the Luſts and Imaginations of their vain Hearts better, than this holy <hi>Light,</hi> that is given unto them for <hi>Salvation</hi>: They chuſe <hi>Barrabas</hi> rather, than <hi>Jeſus.</hi> Yea, they have <hi>ſet up other Lights,</hi> than Chriſt
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57182:5"/>
Jeſus, <hi>God's</hi> great <hi>Light</hi>; and other <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi> than <hi>Chriſt,</hi> God's great <hi>Prophet</hi>; and other <hi>Prieſts</hi> than <hi>Jeſus,</hi> the <hi>High-Prieſt</hi> of the New Covenant: But they are <hi>dark Lights, falſe Prophets</hi> and <hi>blind Prieſts. All that came before me,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>are Thieves and Robbers:</hi> And all that Pray, Preach, Sing, Worſhip, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and not by the <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> of Jeſus, they go before Chriſt, before Chriſt cometh, before he prepareth their Hearts, and toucheth their Lips with a Coal from his Heavenly Altar; and perform Worſhip in their own Will, Time and Power, and ſtay not for his Leadings, And therefore all ſuch rob <hi>Chriſt</hi> of his <hi>Office,</hi> who is the <hi>Leader</hi> of the true <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi>; their Heavenly <hi>High-Prieſt,</hi> to anoint them, and offer up their Sacrifice to God for them; and <hi>Prophet,</hi> to let them ſee and know by his <hi>Light</hi> in their Hearts, what they ought to do, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the New and Everlaſting Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; <hi>I will write my Law in their hearts, and put my Spirit in their inward parts, and they ſhall be all taught of me, ſaith the Lord.</hi>

               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:57182:6"/>Now this is the Queſtion to the whole <hi>World</hi> called <hi>Chriſtian: Do you ſee with this Divine Light? Have you ſearcht your Hearts with it?

or <hi>kill a Man,</hi> is altogether as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable with the Lord. O!

'Tis true, Chriſt Jeſus died for the <hi>ungodly,</hi> but not that they ſhould continue <hi>ungodly,</hi> but <hi>take up his daily Croſs,</hi> and follow him. <hi>Chriſt</hi> (ſaith <hi>Peter</hi>) <hi>hath offered up himſelf once for all, leaving us an Example, that we ſhould follow his ſteps: as he was in this World, ſo we ſhould be,</hi> ſaith <hi>John,</hi> not conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Rudiments; Faſhions and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms of this World, that paſs away; but <hi>tranſformed and renew'd in our minds by the Grace, that he hath given us:</hi> which

            <p>Wherefore be you not deceived, O you <hi>Formal</hi> and <hi>Titular Chriſtians</hi>; God will not be mocked: Such as you ſow, ſuch ſhall you reap at the Hand of the Lord; <hi>Yea, for every idle word ſhall you give an Accompt in the Day of Judgment.</hi> Think not with your ſelves, you have Chriſt to your Saviour, and you are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to God, through <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and that God looketh not upon you, as you are in your ſelves, but as in <hi>Chriſt</hi>; whilſt you walk not after the <hi>Spirit,</hi> but after the <hi>Fleſh:</hi> for the <hi>Wages</hi> of <hi>Sin</hi> is Death; but the Gift of God is Eternal Life through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord: To whom? Not to them, that deſpiſe his <hi>Light</hi> in their Hearts, that grieve his <hi>Spirit,</hi> and by a worldly Converſation go on to Crucifie him; and who follow not Jeſus in the way of <hi>Tribulation</hi> and <hi>Regeneration.</hi> God is of purer Eyes,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:57182:14"/>
than to behold Iniquity; and he looketh upon Men and Women to be, <hi>what they really are,</hi> and not what they imagine themſelves to be: Behold he cometh, and his Reward is with him; and he will reward all according to their Works. <hi>Sinners, while ſuch, can no more come into Chriſt, than into God; for God is in Chriſt, and Chriſt is in God: Chriſt is holy, harmleſs, pure and undefiled, and ſeparate from Sinners.</hi> And if ever you would have God look upon you to be in Chriſt, you muſt <hi>come into Chriſt:</hi> And you can never come into Chriſt, the new and heavenly Man, that is undefiled and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from Sinners, till you <hi>come out of Sin, and the Author of it, the</hi> Devil, <hi>the old Man of Sin, and leave your wicked Deeds of darkneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore be ye ſeparate from every evil Way: Chriſt, the <hi>Immaculate Lamb</hi> of God, came not only to ſave Men from <hi>Wrath,</hi> but from <hi>Sin,</hi> which is the cauſe of Wrath. <hi>Behold the Lamb of God,</hi> ſaith John, <hi>which taketh away the ſin of the World:</hi> Not their <hi>Sin,</hi> that will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him; but the Sins of thoſe that are <hi>weary and heavy laden, that wait, hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:57182:14"/>
thirſt, and cry for his Salvation; whom God hath given for a light to lighten the Gentiles, and for his Salvation to the ends of the Earth.</hi> O you that are called by his Sacred Name, <hi>Repent, Repent! Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare, Prepare</hi> to meet the Lord, who is coming in the way of his <hi>Judgments</hi> to viſit the Inhabitants of the Earth; and put away the evil of your doings, and turn to him, that he may receive you.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Wo</hi> in the Name of the Lord, to all that Rebel againſt the <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> who ſerve another <hi>Maſter,</hi> and follow another <hi>Captain,</hi> and obey the Prince of the Power of the Air, who reigneth in the Hearts of the Children of Diſobedience. Yea, Wo unto all, <hi>who are covered with a Covering, and not of my Spirit; that take counſel, and not of me,</hi> ſaith the Lord: Who gather ſticks, and kindle a Fire of their own, and compaſs themſelves about in the <hi>Sparks,</hi> which they have kindled; for this ſhall they have at my Hand, <hi>They ſhall lye down in Sorrow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wo</hi> from God to all the <hi>Will-worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,</hi> who <hi>Worſhip,</hi> but not in the <hi>Spirit</hi> and in the <hi>Truth</hi>; their <hi>Worſhip</hi> is not

            <p>O this is a great <hi>Myſtery,</hi> but a greater <hi>Truth; Moſes,</hi> the Servant, is externally more <hi>Comely,</hi> than he: Yea, the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets</hi> were as <hi>pleaſant Singers,</hi> and as <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful Inſtruments</hi> of <hi>Muſick</hi>; their <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,</hi> Sights, and glorious Prophecies of the <hi>laſt Days,</hi> and <hi>New-Covenant</hi>-times were, (ſays one of them of old) as a <hi>pleaſant Song:</hi> But the <hi>Son,</hi> the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, when he came, no Beauty, no Excellency, no Comelineſs.

Fleſh and Blood; there is a <hi>Croſs</hi> muſt be taken up, a bitter <hi>Cup</hi> drunk, and a <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> yea, of <hi>Blood</hi> gone through.
