            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>¶ To the gentle Reader.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Mongst other Bookes which are in this our learned age publiſhed in great numbers, there are few, eyther for the honestie of the matter, or commoditie which they bring to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth, or for the pleaſantneſſe of the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and reading, to be preferred before the Chronicles and Hystories. What examples of men deſeruing immortalitie, of exploites worthy great renowne, of vertuous liuing of the posteritie to be embraced, of wiſe handling of weighty affaires, diligently to be marked, and aptly to be applied: what incouragement of nobilitie to noble feates, what diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of vnnaturall ſubiects from wicked treaſons, pernitious rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and damnable doctrines: to conclude, what perſwaſion to honestie, godlyneſſe, and vertue of all ſorts, what diſſuaſions from the contrary is not plentifully in them to be found? So that it is as hard a matter for the Readers of Chronicles, in my fanſie, to paſſe without ſome co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours of wiſedome, inuitements to vertue, and loathing of naughtie factes, as it is for a welfauoured man to walke vp and downe in the hot parching Sunne, &amp; not to be therewith ſunburned. They there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore which with long ſtudie, earneſt good will, &amp; to their great costes and charges haue brought hidden Histories from duskie darkeneſſe to the ſight of the world, and haue bin diligent obſeruers of common wealthes, and noted for the posteritie the fleeting manners of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and accidents of the times: deſerue (at the leaſt) thankes for their paines, and to be miſreported of none, ſeeing they haue laboured for<note place="margin">Note that the backebiter ſlay<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>eth three at once, himſelf by his ovvne ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, hym that crediteth hys falſe tales, and him that he backebiteth.</note> all. I write not this to complayne of ſome mens ingratitude towardes me (although iustly I might) but to ſhewe the commodities which enſue of the reading of Histories, that ſeeing they are ſo great and ſo many, all men would (as they ought) imploy their diligence in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, fruitefull, and delectable peruſing of the ſame, and ſo to accompt of the Authors, as of men carefull for their Countrey: and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, if neede require, by whome they haue taken profite.</p>
            <p>It is now ſeuentene yeres ſince (I ſeing the confuſe order of our late Engliſh Chronicles, and the ignorant handling of auntient affaires) leauing myne owne peculiar gaines, conſecrated my ſelfe to the ſearch
<pb facs="tcp:18151:8"/>
of our famous Antiquities. What I haue done in them before time, the former editions of my Summarie of Chronicles maye wel testifie, but howe farre (be it ſpoken without arrogancie) I haue laboured for the truth more tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſome other, this laſt edition wil euidently declare: wherein, that I differ from the inordinate and vnskilful collections of other men, it is no maruel, ſeeing that I doe not fully agree with my ſelfe, as ſome malitious perſons haue fondely charged me: but lette it be conſidered, that there is nothing perfect at the first, and that it is incident to mankinde to erre and ſlippe ſometime, but onelye the point of fantasticall fooles, to perſeuer and continue in their errors. Wherfore, ſeeing that the peruſing of auncient Records and best ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued Histories of all times (not without great difficultie obteined) doe not onely moue me, but for their aucthoritie driue me to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge both mine and other mens errors, and in acknowledging to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect them, I truste to obtaine thus muche at your handes, that at the leaste you wil call to remembraunce a moste gentle and wiſe lawe of the politike Perſians, wherein it was enacted, that a man accuſed to bee in their lawes a trespaſſer, and founde guiltie of the crime, ſhould not ſtraight waye bee condemned, but after a diligent enquirie and ſearche of his whole life and conuerſation (no ſlaunder imputed vnto him as of importaunce) if the number of his laudable factes didde counteruaile the contrarie, he was full quit of the trespaſſe. The ſame lawe do I wiſhe the readers of theſe my Chronicles to put in vre, that if the errors be not ſo plentiful, as Histories truely alleadged, they wil beare with them: for as I promiſed, ſo haue I tried all matters worthie of immortalitie, by the certaine Touchstone of best allowed Historiographers: and yet notwithstanding, ſome faults by misprinting haue eſcaped the correction, whiche eaſily may be ſeene and amended by the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Reader.</p>

That part of the land is well ſuſtained with commodities, and therefore the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple harde to be vanquiſhed at anye time, by reaſon the woods and Marſhes be at hande for refuge, and hunger eaſed wyth Ueneſon and Fiſh. About <hi>Scotlande</hi> in the Iriſhe Seas, are xl.

The Ilanders generally ſpeake Iriſhe, whiche declareth them to take their originall of the Iriſhe nation. Beyonde Scotlande towarde the Northe, be the Iles of <hi>Orchades,</hi> whiche (as <hi>Ptolome</hi> ſaith) be. xxx. in number, ſome lying in the Ducalidon Sea, and ſome in the Germaine Ocean, the principall of whiche Ilandes is <hi>Pamonia,</hi> bycauſe it is a By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops ſea, and is vnder the gouernement of <hi>Scotlande.</hi> The Ilanders vſe the Gothes ſpéeche, whiche argueth them to procéede from the Germaines. They be tall of ſtature, but verie helthie and luſtie of body and minde, liuing very long, although their chiefeſt foode is fiſhe, for the lande almoſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually beſet with colde, in many places is not able to bear corne, and generally almoſt without trée or buſhe. Beyonde the <hi>Orchades</hi> ſtandeth <hi>Thule,</hi> in the Froſen ſea nowe called Iſelande, to which our marchauntes repaire for fiſhing once euery yeare in the Sommer. And thus much haue I to ſay of the ſcite of Scotlande: nowe of the nature and maners of the people.</p>
            <p>The Scottes whiche inhabite in the Southern parte, bée wel nurtured, and liue in good ciuility, &amp; the moſt ciuile, vſe the Engliſh ſpéech. And for that wood there is geaſon &amp; ſcant, their common fewel is of a blacke ſtone, whiche they dig out of the Earth. The other part Northern, &amp; ful of mountaines, a very rude and homely kinde of people doth inhabite, which are called the redſhankes or wilde Scottes. They be clothed with a mantel and ſhyrte ſaffroned, after the Iriſhe manner, going bare legged to the knée. Their weapons are bowes &amp; dartes, with a verie brode ſword and a dagger, ſharp only at the one ſide. All ſpeake Iriſh, féeding on fiſhe, milke, chéeſe, &amp; fleſhe, hauing a great number of Cattell. The Scottes differ from the Engliſhe in lawes and cuſtomes, bicauſe they vſe the ciuill lawe as almoſt other Countryes doe. The Engliſh haue theyr own laws and edicts. In certain other conditions they be not farre vnlike, but their language is one, their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:18151:13"/>
&amp; complexion like, one corage in battel, and in the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie one deſire and pregnancie in hunting. The countrey houſes be narrow, couered with ſtraw &amp; réede, wherein the people and beaſts do lodge togither. Theyr towns beſides <hi>S. Iohns</hi> towne are vnwalled, which is to be aſcribed to their animoſitie &amp; hardineſſe, fixing all their ſuccor &amp; helpe alway in the valiancie of their body. The Scots are verye wiſe, as their learning declareth. For to whatſoeuer Art they do ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply themſelues, they eaſily profite in the ſame.

               <hi>Wales</hi> the third parte of Brytaine lyeth vppon the lefte<note place="margin">VVales.</note> hande, whiche like a Promontorie or foreland, or an Iſle (as it were) on euery ſide is compaſſed with the maine Sea, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Southeaſt part with the riuer of <hi>Sabrine,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called <hi>Seuern,</hi> which diuideth Wales from England, although ſome late writers affyrme Hereford to be a bound betwéene Wales and England, and ſay that Wales begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth at Chepſtow, where the riuer <hi>Wey</hi> (augmented with an<note place="margin">This arme of the Sea, as I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Therefore Wales is extended from the town of Chepſtow, where it beginneth almoſt by a ſtraight line a little aboue Shrowſburie, euen to Weſtche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Northward. Into that part, ſo many of the Brytaines as remayned aliue after the ſlaughter and loſſe of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, at the length being driuen to their ſhiftes, did repayre,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:18151:13"/>
as auntient writings report, where partly through refuge of the mountaines, and partly of the wooddes and mariſhes, they remained in ſafetie: which part they enioy euen to this day. That land afterwards the Engliſh men did cal <hi>Wales:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Giraldus Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brenſis.</note> and the Brytaines the inhabitants of the ſame, <hi>Walſhmen:</hi> for amongs the Germaines, <hi>Walſhman,</hi> ſignifieth a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, an alien, an outborne or ſtrange man, that is, ſuche a one, as hath a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>guage from theirs, for <hi>Wal</hi> in their tongue is called a ſtranger borne, as an Italian or French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, which differ in ſpéech from the Germaine. <hi>Man</hi> ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>Homo,</hi> which is a Man in Engliſhe. Therefore Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, a people of <hi>Germanie,</hi> after they had wonne <hi>Brytaine,</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Brytaines, whiche eſcaped after the deſtruction of theyr Country, after their Country maner, <hi>Walſhmen,</hi> bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they had an other tongue or ſpeach beſides theirs: and the la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d which they inhabited <hi>Wales,</hi> which name afterward both to the people and country did remaine. By this meane the Brytaines with their kingdome loſte their name. But they which affirme that name to be deriued of their Kyng or Quéene, without doubt be deceyued. The countrey ſoyle towardes the Sea coaſt, &amp; in other places in the valleys and playnes, is moſte fertile, whiche yéeldeth bothe to man and beaſt great plenty of fruite and graſſe: but in other places for the moſt part it is barraine &amp; leſſe fruitful<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> bicauſe it lacketh tillage: for whych cauſe huſbandmen doe liue hardly, eating Oten cakes, &amp; drinking Milke mixt with water. There bée many towns &amp; ſtrong Caſtels, &amp; foure Biſhoprickes, if the<note place="margin">Foure Bishope in VVales.</note> Biſhopricke of <hi>Hereford</hi> be counted in England, as the late wryters declare. The firſte Biſhopricke is <hi>Meneue,</hi> ſo called of <hi>Meneua,</hi> which at this day they call <hi>Saint Dauids,</hi> a Citie very auntient, ſcituated vppon the Sea coaſt, and boundeth Weſtwarde towarde Irelande. An other is <hi>Landaffe,</hi> the thirde <hi>Bangor,</hi> and the fourth <hi>Saint Aſaph,</hi> which be vnder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury.</hi> The Welſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue a language fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Engliſhmen, which (as they ſay y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> fetch their pedigrée fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Troians) doth partly ſounde of the Troian antiquitie,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:18151:14"/>
and partly of the Gréeke. But hewſoeuer it is, the Walſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men doe not pronounce their ſpeache ſo pleaſauntlye and gently as the Engliſhmen doe, bicauſe they ſpeake more in the throate: and contrariwiſe, the Engliſhmen rightly follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing the Latines, do expreſſe their voice ſomewhat within the lips, whiche to the hearers ſéemeth pleaſaunt and ſwéete. And thus much of <hi>Wales,</hi> the thirde part of Brytaine.</p>
            <p>Nowe followeth the fourth and laſt part of Brytaine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Cornwal.</hi> This part beginneth on that ſide which ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth towarde <hi>Spaine</hi> Weſtward: Toward the Eaſte, it is of bredth foure ſcore and ten miles, extending a little beyond S. Germains, which is a very famous village ſituate on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> right hand vppon the Sea coaſte, where the greateſt bredth of that Countrey is but. xx. miles: for this parcel of land on the right hande is compaſſed with the coaſt of the maine Sea: and on the left hand with that arme of the ſea, which (as before is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared) parteth the land, and runneth vp to Chepſtow, wher the Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>try is in forme of a horne: For at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firſt it is narrow, and then groweth broder a little beyonde the ſayd town of S. Germain. Eaſtward it bordreth vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d: Weſt, South, &amp; North, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> main ſea is rou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d about it: it is a very barren ſoile, yéelding fruite more through trauel of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tillers &amp; huſba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, than through the goodneſſe of the ground: but there is greate plentie of Lead &amp; Tin, in the mining &amp; digging wherof doth ſpecially conſiſt the liuing and ſuſtentation of the inhabita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts. Their tong is far diſſonant from Engliſh, but it is much like to the Walſh tong, bicauſe they haue many words co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon to both tongs: yet this difference there is betwéen them, when a Walſh man ſpeaketh, the Corniſh ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> rather vnderſtandeth manie words ſpoken by the Walſhman, than the whole tale he telleth, whereby it is manifeſt, that thoſe thrée people doe vnderſtand one another, in like maner as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Southern Scots doe perceiue and vnderſtand the Northern. But it is a thing very rare and maruellous, that in one Iland there ſhould be ſuch varietie of ſpéeches. <hi>Cornwal</hi> is in the Dioceſſe of Exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, whiche was once worthy to be counted the fourthe parte
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:18151:14"/>
of the Iland, for the contrariety of the language. Afterwards the Norma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, which conſtituted a kingdome of al thoſe thrée parts, reckened Cornwal to be one of the Counties or ſhires of the Countrey. Thus much of the particular deſcription of Brytaine, that the whole bodie of the Realme (by the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers) maye be the better knowne to ſome peraduenture that neuer heard the ſame before.</p>
            <p>The forme of the Ilande is <hi>Triquetra,</hi> or thrée cornered,<note place="margin">Strab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

            <p>The thirde ſide whiche is the South ſide, is farre ſhorter than the other: for the Ilande is greater of length than of bredth. And as in the other two partes is conteyned the length, euen ſo in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> laſt, the bredth, in which place the bredth beginneth: and ſo continuing from the Southe parte to the North, it is but narrowe. The firſt and right corner of which Iland Eaſtwarde, is in Kent, at Douer and Sandwich. Fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence to Callais or Boloigne in Fraunce, is the diſtance of xxx. myles. From this Angle, which is againſt France, to the thirde Angle, which is in the Northe in Scotlande, the maine wherof boundeth vpon Germanie, but no land ſéene, (and there the Iland is like vnto a wedge euen at the verye Angle of the lande in Scotlande,) the lengthe is ſeauen hundred myles. Againe, the length from this corner at Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer in Kent, to the vttermoſte parte of Cornewall, being S. Michaels mount (whiche is the Weſt parte or Weſt Angle) is ſuppoſed to be thrée hundered myles. From this lefte An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle being the Weſt part and the vttermoſt part of Cornwal, which hath a proſpect towardes Spaine, in which parte alſo ſtandeth Irelande, ſcituate betwéene Britaine and Spaine to the North Angle in the further part of Scotland, in which parte the Iland doth end, the length is eight hundred miles, in whych part there be very good hauens, &amp; ſafe harboroughes for ſhippes, and apte paſſages into Ireland, being not paſte one dayes ſayling: but the ſhorter paſſage is from Wales to
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:18151:15"/>
Waterforde, a towne in Irelande vpon the Sea coaſt, muche like to that paſſage betwéene Douer and Calays, or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more: but the ſhorteſt paſſage of all, is out of Scotland. From this laſt Angle to Hampton, which is a Towne vpon the Sea coaſt, with a hauen ſo called toward the South, and therfore called Southhampton, betwéene the angles of Kent and Cornwall, they doe meaſure by ſtraight line the whole length of the Ilande, and doe ſaye, that it contayneth. 800. myles, as the bredth from <hi>Meneua</hi> or Saint Dauids to Yar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth, which is in the vttermoſt part of the Iland towards the Eaſte, doeth conteyne. 200. miles, for the bredth of the Ilande is in the South part, which part is the front and beginning of the lande, and endeth narrowe, or as it were in a ſtrayghte. So the circuite or compaſſe of the Ilande is. 1800. myles, which is. 200. leſſe than <hi>Caeſar</hi> doth recken or accompt. (⸪)</p>

The long maladie of his Father, cauſed him to perſwade Phiſitions to rid the olde man out of the worlde, vntil that <hi>Seuerus,</hi> being conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, ended his life, who was the moſte famous of all Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours in war like affayres: For none other had obtayned ſo many victories and conqueſts, either ciuil againſt his aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, or for rayne againſt the barbarous nations.

The ſame Image looketh ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry pale, like a diſeaſed patient. About the bed on eyther ſide, a great part of the day, do certayne perſons ſit. That is to wit on the left ſide, the Senate, clothed in blacke garments: and on the right ſide, many matrones.

was in an euill ſtate, and that whereas in this Realme of <hi>England,</hi> before the comming of the foreſayd Duke <hi>William</hi> there were no bondmen, now all, as well noble men, as the common people, were without reſpect made ſubiecte vnto the perpetuall bondage of the <hi>Normans,</hi> taking an occaſion by the perill and danger that their neighbors were in, to prouide for the ſafegard of themſelues and their Countrey, they cauſed to aſſemble at <hi>Canterbury</hi> all the people of the Countie of <hi>Kent,</hi> and declared to them the perils and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers imminent, the miſerie that their neighbours were come into, the pride and inſolencie of the <hi>Normans,</hi> and the hardneſſe and griefe of bondage and ſeruile eſtate: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon all the people rather chooſing to end their vnfortunate life, than to ſubmit themſelues to an vnaccuſtomed yoke of ſeruitude and bondage, with a common conſent determined to méete Duke <hi>William,</hi> and to fight with him for the laws of their Countrey. And y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> foreſayd <hi>Stigand</hi> the Archbiſhop, and the Abbot <hi>Egelſin,</hi> chooſing rather to die in battell, than to ſée their nation in ſo euill an eſtate, being encouraged by the examples of the holy <hi>Machabees,</hi> became Captayne of the armie. And at a day appoynted, all the people met at <hi>Swaneſcombe</hi> two miles weſt from <hi>Graueſ-end</hi> and being hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in the woods, lay priuily in wayte for the comming of the foreſayd Duke <hi>William.</hi> And bycauſe it can not hurt to be very wary in ſuch caſes, they agréed before hande, that when the Duke was come, and the paſſages on euery ſide ſtopped, to the end he ſhould no way be able to eſcape, euery one of them, as well Horſemen as footemen, ſhould beare boughes in their hands.

And as ſoone as the Captaynes of the <hi>Kentiſhmen</hi> ſawe that Duke <hi>William</hi> was encloſed in the middeſt of their armie,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:18151:83"/>

            <p>My Lord Duke, behold the people of <hi>Kent</hi> commeth forth to méete you, and to receiue you as their liege Lord, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring at your hands the things which pertayne to peace, and that vnder this condition, that all the people of <hi>Kent</hi> may enioy for euer their antient liberties, and may for euermore vſe the lawes and cuſtomes of the Countrey, otherwiſe they are ready preſently to bidde battell to you, and them that be with you, and are minded rather to die héere altogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, than to departe from the lawes and cuſtomes of their Countrey, and to ſubmit themſelues to bondage, whereof as yet they neuer had experience. The Duke ſéeing himſelf to be driuen in ſuch a ſtraight and narrow pinch, conſulted a while with them that came with him, prudently conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, that if he ſhould take any repulſe or diſpleaſure at the hands of this people, which be the key of <hi>England,</hi> all that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer he had done before, ſhould be vndone againe, and of no effect, and all his hope and ſafetie ſhoulde ſtande in danger and ieopardy: not ſo willingly as wiſely he granted the people of <hi>Kent</hi> their requeſt. So when the couenant was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed, and pledges giuen on both ſides, the <hi>Kentiſhmen</hi> being ioyfull, conducted the <hi>Normans</hi> (who alſo were glad) vnto <hi>Rochester,</hi> and yéelded vp to the Duke, the Earledome of <hi>Kent,</hi> and the noble Caſtell of <hi>Douer.</hi> Thus the antiente liberties of <hi>Englande,</hi> and the lawes and cuſtomes of the Countrey, whiche before the comming of Duke <hi>William</hi>

The right that belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged to <hi>Robert Fitz Walter,</hi> Chaſtelein of <hi>London,</hi> Lord of <hi>Wedeham,</hi> were theſe:</p>

            <p>This battayle was fought on the ſeuentéenth of October.

By this meanes a great report and no leſſe fear filled the heartes of all <hi>French</hi> men, whiche report at length came to the eares of the Prince lying at <hi>Regla,</hi> wherefore he ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering all the power he had with him in hys Dukedome, to the intent to méete hys Father, whiche he muſte doe by trauelling through <hi>Fraunce,</hi> he came at length to <hi>Brugetat,</hi> where he was certifyed that the Earle of <hi>Armenia,</hi> woulde after his departure haue ſpoyled the Countrey, and for that intent had prouided a greate bande of men: wherefore hée ſent backe to the gouernour of <hi>Gaſcoigne,</hi> vnto <hi>Barnarde de Libret,</hi> and other.

After this the ſpies declared that the <hi>Frenche</hi> King was come downe to <hi>Turon,</hi> to prouide armies to go againſt the Prince, of the which tydings the Prince being gladde, he pighte his tentes againſte the <hi>Frenche</hi> King, but could not paſſe the riuer of <hi>Leger,</hi> by reaſon of greate floudes, and the <hi>Frenche</hi> King hadde broken all the bridges, to the intent there ſhoulde be no paſſage betwixte the Prince and the Duke of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> whoſe armyes might wel euerye nyght perceyue eache others fiers in the Campes: but the Prince folowing alongſt the riuer of <hi>Legers</hi> Eaſtwarde, he pyghte hys tentes neare vnto <hi>Turon,</hi> where loking for the <hi>Frenche</hi> Kyng foure dayes, hoping to fighte with him, for that hée was diſtaunte but one league off, he vnderſtoode that the <hi>Frenche</hi> King was retyred backe to <hi>Blamia,</hi> ten leagues off: paſſing ouer by a Bridge the Riuer of <hi>Legers</hi> at a place vſed betwixt two ſtrong Townes, and ſo towarde <hi>Poyters.</hi> This retyring of the <hi>Frenche</hi> king certifyed, the Prince returned backe, intending to haue mette him in his waye, whych he coulde not doe: yet croſſing ouer all, as he imagined the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer way, he ſette vpon the tayle of his enymies, and cut fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them the Earles of <hi>Inyni</hi> and <hi>Winters,</hi> and alſo the Marſhall of <hi>Burgonie,</hi> theſe being take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, died, as was thought, through the great toyle they had taken: night drawing on, our men gaue themſelues to reſte in a wood, intending the next day to take theyr iourney towarde <hi>Poiters,</hi> and by the waye they were certifyed that the <hi>Frenche</hi> King, with greate prouiſion prepared himſelfe to battayle, and drew nigh to our tents:<note place="margin">The Batayle of Poyters.</note> the Prince therefore committed the vawarde of the armye to the Earles of <hi>Warwick</hi> and <hi>Oxford,</hi> the middle ward was guided by the Prince, and the rerewarde was led by the Earles of <hi>Saliſburie</hi> and <hi>Suffolke.</hi> In all the whole armye of the Prince there was not aboue foure thouſande menne of armes, one thouſande armed ſouldiours, and two thouſand

The pompous nobilitie of the <hi>French</hi> men drewe nygh, greatly diſdayning the ſmall company of the <hi>Engliſhe</hi> men, for they had in number eight thouſande fighting ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours, they had alſo ſeuen auntients. At this matter a gret many of our men murmured, bycauſe of late, a great part of our army was ſent to defende <hi>Gaſcoigne.</hi> There was among the <hi>French</hi> men a certaine <hi>Scotte</hi> called <hi>William Douglas,</hi> a man of great force and practiſe in the Warres: this manne did the <hi>French</hi> king make Knight, and bycauſe he knewe he woulde be a deadly enimie to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> men, he gladlye hearkned to his aduices. This <hi>William</hi> was Captain ouer two hundred <hi>Scottes:</hi> theſe men vnderſtoode wel that it was the cuſtome of the <hi>Engliſhe</hi> men in thoſe dayes to fighte on foote, in which point they followed the <hi>Scottes,</hi> and the <hi>Scots</hi> alſo prouoked the <hi>French</hi> king and other <hi>French</hi> men to fight in like maner. The <hi>French</hi> king obeying his fooliſh counſel, gladly agréed vnto his ſayings, wherevpon he ſente lighte horſſemen into the Cittie, that they ſhoulde ſuffer no man to make any chaſe, but only. 500. horſſemen well appointed to come out againſte the Archers, in the beginning of the conflict, and to runne them ouer and to treade them vnder theyr horſſe féete: but theſe performed not that whiche was commaunded them, as it appeared by the ſequele thereof. The armies being ſet in a readineſſe on both ſides for to fighte early on Sonday in the morning, which was notable fayre, beholde there came the Cardinall of <hi>Petragoren,</hi> and charged the prince, in the name of God who was crucified, that it mighte pleaſe him to deferre the warre for a tyme, both for eccleſiaſticall peace, and alſo for the ſparing of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian bloud, and to the ende there might be a treatie had of peace, the whiche he promiſed ſhoulde be performed wyth great honour on both ſides. The Prince neyther feared nor refuſed peace, but modeſtly agréed to the requeſt of this Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. All this day nowe being appointed for the obtaynyng of peace, the army of the <hi>French</hi> men encreaſed by the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of a thouſande men of armes, and alſo of other. On the

morrowe after, the Cardinall came againe from the <hi>Frenche</hi> king, in his behalfe to requeſt a truce, which ſhould endure for one whole yeare, the whiche the Prince denyed, yet at the importunate ſute of that Cardinal, he graunted a truce to continue till Chriſtmaſſe next comming. Therefore the Cardinall returning to the <hi>Frenche</hi> King, requeſted him of pledges for the truce, but the <hi>Marſhall Dawdenam, Geffrey de Charney,</hi> &amp; <hi>Douglas</hi> the <hi>Scot,</hi> perſwaded him that by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon reaſon it coulde not come to paſſe that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> men ſhoulde at that time preuayle, and eſpecially, bycauſe they were but fewe, and in a ſtraunge Countrey, &amp; wearyed out miſerably with their toyle in trauel, &amp; therefore not ableto indure ſo great a number of the <hi>French</hi> men of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> who ſtood in defence of theyr own lande. The Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing certified, that the Captaines of the <hi>French,</hi> wold haue no kind of peace, but ſuch as they could get by force of armes, &amp; calling his men togither, he made to them an Oration firſt in generall, and then to his Archers as followeth: your ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Hauing ſpoken theſe words, he perceyued that there was a Hill harde by, whiche was planted on the toppe with hedges and ditches, the inſide whereof was very playne, and a paſture fielde on the one ſide thereof, with manye roughe buſhes, and on the other ſide it was all planted with vines, and the reſidue was playne, in the top wherof he did imagine the armye of the <hi>French</hi> to lye betwixt our men and the Hil. There was gret and lowe vallyes, and a péece of mariſh ground. One com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of the Prince finding out a narrowe paſſage, entred the valley and toke the Hyll, where among the buſhes they hidde themſelues, taking the aduantage of the place.

of the beſt Citizens arreſted, the Maior was ſente to <hi>Windſor</hi> Caſtel, and the other to other priſons, til the King with his counſell ſhould determine, what ſhould be done with them, and there it was determined, that from thenceforth the <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doners</hi> ſhoulde not choſe nor haue anye Maior, but that the King ſhoulde appointe one of his Knightes to be ruler of the Citie: their priuiledges were reuoked, their liberties adnulled, and their lawes abrogated.

            <p>Alſo it was eſtabliſhed, that any Traytor conuicted, to ſtand againſt the Kings regalitie, ſhould be adiudged wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie to ſuffer puniſhment to be appoynted for ſuch offence.</p>
            <p>Alſo it was enacted, that criminall cauſes from thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth-ſhould be determined in euery Parliament, and then licence being had to depart, a great ſturre was made as is vſed, wherevpon the Kings Archers, in number four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, compaſſed the Parliament houſe, thinking there had bin in the houſe ſome broyle or fighting, with their bowes bent, their arrowes ſet in them, and drawing, readie to ſhoote, to the terrour of all that were there, but the King héerewith comming, pacified them.

the King, bycauſe the ſecond Article in the Parliament is for puniſhmente to be appoynted for ſuche as violate the Kings royall authoritie, I beſéech your grace that you will authorice me by way of appealing, of accuſing, or impea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, with licence to make declaration from one to the reſt ſo often and when to me and to my fellowes it may ſéeme expedient, and it was graunted, then <hi>Buſhy</hi> had theſe words: I accuſe <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Arundell,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury,</hi> of thréefold treaſon.</p>

The Duke of <hi>Lancaster</hi> ſayde to hym, thou Traytor, that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don is reuoked. The Earle anſwered, truely thou lyeſt, I was neuer Traytor. Alſo, the Duke of <hi>Lancaster</hi> ſayde, why diddeſt thou purchaſe thy pardon, the Earle anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, to eſcape the tongues of myne enimies, of whome thou arte one, and verily, as farre forth as toucheth Treaſon, thou haſt more néede of pardon than I. The King ſayde, make anſwere vnto thyne appeale. The Earle anſwered, I ſée well that theſe perſons haue accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed me of Treaſon, ſhewing the appealementes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they all lye, I was neuer Traytor, but I aſke alwayes the benefyte of my pardon, the whyche youre Grace

Then ſayd the King, I did ſo grant it that it ſhould not be againſt me: then ſayde the Duke of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> then the graunt auayleth not. The Erle anſwered, truly of that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don I know leſſe than thy ſelfe, that was then on the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide the Seas. Then ſaid <hi>Sir Iohn Buſhy,</hi> that pardon is reuoked by the King, the Lordes, and vs his faithfull people: the Earle anſwered, where be thoſe faithful people? I know thée well and thy company how ye are gathered togither, not to deale faithfully, for the faithful people of the Realme are not héere, and therefore the people do lamente for me, and well I know that thou haſt bin euer falſe. And then <hi>Buſhy</hi> and his fellowes cried out, Behold ſoueraigne Lord and King, how this Traytor goeth about to reyſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition betwixt vs, and thoſe people that are at home. The Earle anſwered, ye lye, I am no Traytor. Then roſe the Earle of <hi>Darby</hi> and ſayde, didſt not thou ſay thus to me at <hi>Huntington,</hi> where we were firſt aſſembled togither to riſe, that it was the beſt afore all things to take the King. The Earle ſayd to the Earle of <hi>Darby,</hi> thou lyeſt on thy head, I neuer thought of my ſoueraigne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Lorde the King, but that that was good, and for his honor. Then ſayd the King, didſt not thou ſay to me in time of thy Parliament, in the Bath behinde the <hi>White Hall,</hi> that <hi>Sir Simon de Burley</hi> was wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie of death for many cauſes, and I anſwered, that I knew no cauſe of death in him, and yet thou and thy fellowes didſt trayterouſlie put him to death, and then the Duke of <hi>Lanca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> pronounced iudgement againſt him in this manner: <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard,</hi> I <hi>Iohn,</hi> Steward of <hi>England</hi> iudge thée to be a Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and I condemne thée to be drawne and hanged, to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed and quartered, and thy lands, tailed and not tailed, from thée and from thine heires of thy body deſcending, to be confilcate: then the King for reuerence of his bloud, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him only to be beheaded, and then was he ledde to the <hi>Tower hill,</hi> and there beheaded, and was buried at the

            <p>On Friday, the King appoynted a prefixed day to the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> to wéete, the third of the ſixt wéeke, to depart the Realme.</p>
            <p>Alſo it was ordeyned, that all the Lords Spiritual and Temporall, ſhould ſweare inuiolably to obſerue whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer in this Parliament were enacted, and that the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the Church ſhould be pronounced by the Prelates againſt all thoſe that ſhould go againſt the ſame.</p>

            </p>
            <p>About the feaſt of <hi>Saint Faith,</hi> the King called a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at <hi>Couentry,</hi> and ſent proceſſe to the Sheriffes that they ſhould chooſe no Knights nor burgeſſes that had any know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the lawes of the Realme, by reaſon wherof, it was called the Lay mans Parliame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.

And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſpeker of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Parliame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſaid with a loud voice, that he little regarded y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prayers of the Church, the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>terbury</hi> anſwered: then (quoth he) I know to what end the fortune of the Realme will come, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſuffrages of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church are not ſet by, wherwith y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Godhead is wont to be appeaſed: ſurely that Kingdome neuer co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinueth ſtable y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> is voyde of prayer &amp; deuotion: notwithſtanding, thinke not that thou ſhalt without puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t take away the poſſeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the Church, for if the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterburie</hi> liue, thou ſhalte haue euill taking of any thing that is his. Then the Archbiſhoppe roſe vppe, and knéeled downe before the Kyng, deſiring hym to conſider howe gratiouſlie,
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:18151:288"/>
and by Gods fauour he had atteyned to the Kingdome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that he would co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider his firſt promis, which was, that he would preſerue vnto euery man their right and title ſo farre as lay in him. He alſo willed him to remember the oth which he voluntarily made, which was, that he would honor and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the Church, and Miniſters thereof, wherefore he deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him to permit and ſuffer the Church to enioy the priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges and liberties which in time of his predeceſſors it did enioy, and to feare that King, by whome all Kings doe raigne.</p>
            <p>When the Archbiſhop had ſaid theſe and like words, the King commanded him to go to his ſeate againe, and ſayde, that his intent and purpoſe was to leaue the Church in as good ſtate or better than he found it. And then the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop ſpeaking to the Knightes and burgeſſes, ſayde: you, and ſuch like as you be, haue giuen ſuch counſell vnto our King, and to his predeceſſors<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to confiſcate the goodes of the<note place="margin">In Edvvard the thirds time.</note> Celles whiche the <hi>Frenchmen</hi> and <hi>Normans</hi> did poſſeſſe in <hi>England,</hi> and ſayd, that by them he ſhould heape vp great ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, as in déede they were woorth many thouſands of gold: notwithſtanding it is moſt true that the King at this day is not the richer thereby of halfe a Marke, for you haue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted, or at the leaſt begged them out of his handes, and haue appropriated the ſaide goodes vnto your ſelues, ſo that it may be coniectured that your requeſt to haue our tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralities, is not for the Kings profite, but for your owne co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetouſneſſe: for without doubt, if the King (as God forbid he ſhould) fulfill your wicked purpoſe, he ſhould not be one farthing the richer the next yeare following: and ſurely, I will ſooner let my head be cut off, than that the Churche ſhould be deſtitute of the leaſt right that perteyneth to it &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The Cleargie granted a tenth and a halfe, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons two fiftéenes, on condition the Lord <hi>Furniuall</hi> ſhould receyne it to ſpend in the Kings warres.</p>

            <p>He builded the great body of the Church of <hi>Saint Swi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi> in <hi>Winchester,</hi> where the Sermons are made, &amp; where his body is enterred, a very princely worke: neyther did he for all this diminiſh any thing of his ordinarie houſholde charges, and fedde (as the writing engraued on his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre ſheweth) both rich and poore.

            <p>The xxv. day of October, the King of <hi>England</hi> in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning very earely ſet forth his hoſt in array. He commanded that his Horſſes and other carriages ſhoulde be left in the Uillage where he had lodged. The order of his field was thus: The middle battell whereof the King was conductor, was ſet in the midſt of the field, directly againſt the middle battell of his aduerſaries. On the right ſide was the firſt battell, and therewith the right wing: and on the left ſide the laſt battell, and the left wing. And theſe battayles ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning nigh togither, by the prouidence of God, proued vnto this King a defenſible place for his hoſt, for the Uillage wherein he was lodged before, defended his hoſt from all inuaſions on the backe, and the field wherein he was, was defended on both ſides with two ſmall Riuers.</p>
            <p>This noble King was armed with ſure and right beautifull armour. On his head a bright Helmet, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon was ſet a Crowne of Golde, repleate with pearle and pretious ſtones, maruellous rich. In his Shield he bare the armes both of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France.</hi> And thus armed, he was mounted vpon a goodly great Horſſe, and after hym were ledde certayne noble Horſſes, with their bridles and trappers of Goldſmithes worke, and vpon them alſo were beaten the Armes of <hi>England</hi> and of <hi>France.</hi> Thus this victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious King prepared to battell, encouraged his people to the field that approached at hand.</p>
            <p>The night before this cruell battell, by the aduiſe and counſell (as it is ſaid) of the Duke of <hi>Yorke,</hi> the King had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t through his hoſt, that euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould puruey him a ſtake ſharp at both ends, which the <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> fixed in the ground before them in the field, to defend them from the oppreſſion of Horſſemen. The <hi>Frenchmen</hi> had ſuch confidence in the great multitude of their people, and
<pb n="595" facs="tcp:18151:305"/>
in their great Horſſes, that many of their great Princes and Lordes leauing behinde them their Souldiers, Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derts, and other Enſignes, came towards the <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> in right great haſt, as if they had bin aſſured of victory.</p>
            <p>The battayles of the <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> were as large as the<note place="margin">Enguerant.</note> field wherein they fought would ſuffer, which was greatly to their aduantage, for by that meanes their enimies were letted to come vpon them at the ſides and backes of their hoſt.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Frenchmen</hi> had ordeyned their battels with two ſharpe fronts, like vnto two hornes, which alwayes back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward was broader and broader: and theſe ſharp battels ſet vpon the <hi>Engliſhmens</hi> middle ward, intending to haue runne thorough the whole fielde, but the <hi>Frenchmen</hi> were ſlayne and wounded by the Engliſh Archers, and by the helpe of the ſtakes which the <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> had fixed before them in the grounde, whereby the Horſſemen were conſtreyned to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, or elſe to runne vpon the ſtakes, where many of them were ouerthrowne and wounded, and many both Horſſes and men ſlayne. The battell and fight encreaſed maruellouſly by the ſpace of thrée houres, in all whych time no man was taken priſoner, but innumerable were ſlaine, vpon whoſe dead bodyes they that followed were ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne and ſlayne. Thus after a long and cruell battell, there approched no man to battell, but to death, of whome, after that an innumerable company were ſlayne, and that the victorie remayned to the <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> they ſpared to ſley and take priſoners of the <hi>Frenchmen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this mortall battell, the noble King of <hi>England</hi> fought with his enimies as a famiſhed Lion for his pray, recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing on his Helmet, and other armour, many and greate ſtrokes: at the laſt, the victorie obteyned, and the greate hoſt of the <hi>Frenchmen</hi> ſlayne, taken, wounded, and van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed, forthwith another hoſt of <hi>Frenchmen,</hi> no leſſe than the firſte, ſuppoſing the <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> now to be wéeried, prepared themſelues to begin agayne a newe battayle.

It is for truth reported, that the Dutches his mother had ſo much a doe in hir trauaile, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhe coulde not be deliuered of him vncut, &amp; that he came into the world with the féete for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, as me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be borne outward, &amp; (as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fame runneth) alſo not vntoothed, whether me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of hatred report aboue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> truth, or elſe y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> nature chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged hir courſe in his beginning, which in the courſe of his life many things vnnaturally committed.

He was cloſe &amp; ſecrete, a déepe diſſimuler, lowly of

countenaunce, arrogant of heart, outwardlye coumpinable where he inwardlye hated, not letting to kiſſe whom hée thought to kill: diſpiteous &amp; cruell, not for euill wil alway, but ofter for ambition, &amp; either for the fuertie or increaſe of his eſtate. Friend &amp; foe was much what indifferent, where his aduauntage grewe, he ſpared no mans death, whoſe life wythſtoode his purpoſe. He ſlewe with his owne handes King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixt, being priſoner in the Tower, as men<note place="margin">The death of King Henrie the ſixte.</note> conſtantly ſaid, &amp; that without commaundement or know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the King, which would vndoubtedly, if he had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended that thing, haue appointed that butcherly office to ſome other, than his owne borne brother.</p>
            <p>Some wiſe men alſo wéen, that his drift couertly conuey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, lacked not in helping forth his brother of <hi>Clarence</hi> to his death: which he reſiſted openly, howbeit ſomewhat (as men déemed) more faintly, than he that were hartily mynded to his wealth. And they y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> thus déeme, thinke that he long time in K. <hi>Edwardes</hi> lyfe, forethought to be King, in caſe that the King his brother (whoſe life he looked that euill diet ſhould ſhorten) ſhould happen to deceaſſe (as in déede he did) while his children were yong. And they déeme, that for this intent he was glad of his brothers death y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Duke of <hi>Clarence,</hi> whoſe life muſt néedes haue hindered him ſo intending, whether the ſame duke of <hi>Clarence</hi> had kept him true to his Nephew the yong King, or enterpriſed to be King himſelfe. But of al this poynt, is there no certaintie, and who ſo deuineth vpon coniectures, may aſwell ſhoote to farre as to ſhort. Howbeit this haue I by credible information learned, that the ſelfe night, in which King <hi>Edward</hi> dyed, one <hi>Miſtlebrooke</hi> long ere morning, came in great haſt to the houſe of one <hi>Pottier</hi> dwelling in <hi>Redcroſſe ſtreete</hi> without <hi>Creplegate in Loxdon:</hi> and when he was with haſtie rapping quicklye letten in, he ſhewed vnto <hi>Pottier</hi> that King <hi>Edwarde</hi> was departed. By my truth man quoth <hi>Pottier,</hi> then will my Maiſter the Duke of <hi>Glocester</hi> be King. What cauſe he had ſo to thinke harde it is to ſay, whether he being toward him, any thing
<pb n="757" facs="tcp:18151:386"/>
knewe that he had ſuch thing purpoſed, or otherwiſe had any inkeling thereof: for he was not likely to ſpeake it of nought.</p>
            <p>But now to returne to the courſe of this hiſtorie. Were it that the Duke of <hi>Gloucester</hi> hadde of olde foreminded this concluſion, and was nowe at erſte therevnto moued, and putte in hope by the occaſion of the tender age of the yong Princes, his Nephewes, (as oportunitie and likelihoode of ſpéede, putteth a man in courage of that he neuer intended) certaine is it, that he contriued their deſtruction, with the vſurpation of the regall dignitie vpon himſelfe. And, foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muche as, he well wiſte, and holpe to maintaine, a long continued grudge and heart-burning betwene the Quéenes kinred, and the Kings bloude, either partie enuying others aucthoritie, he nowe thought their diuiſion ſhoulde be (as it was indéede) a furtherly beginning to the purſuit of hys intent, and a ſure ground for the foundation of al his buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, if he might firſte, vnder the pretexte of reuenging old diſpleaſure, abuſe the anger and ignorance of the one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, to the deſtruction of the other, and then winne to hys purpoſe as many as he coulde, and thoſe that could not bée wonne, myght be loſt ere they looked therefore: For of one thing was he certayne, that if hys intent were perceyued, he ſhould ſoone haue made peace betwéene the both parties with his owne bloud.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Edwarde</hi> in his life, albeit that this diſſention be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene his friendes ſomewhat irked him: yet in his good health he ſomewhat the leſſe regarded it, bicauſe he thought whatſoeuer buſineſſe ſhoulde fall betwéene them, himſelfe ſhould alway be able to rule both the parties.

of their friendes, of which either partie ſhould counſell for their owne commoditie &amp; rather by pleaſaunt aduiſe to wyn themſelues fauour, than by profitable aduertiſement to doo their children good, he called ſome of them before him that were at variaunce, and in eſpeciall the Lord Marques <hi>Dorſet</hi> the Quéenes ſonne by hir firſt huſbande, &amp; William the Lord <hi>Haſtings</hi> a noble man then Lord Chamberlaine, againe who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Quéene ſpecially grudged, for the great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour the King bare him: &amp; alſo for that the thought him ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly familiar with the King in wanto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> company.

But ſithen things paſſed cannot be gainecalled, much ought we the more beware, by what occaſion we haue taken ſo great hurt afore, that we eft ſoones fall not in that occaſion againe. Now be thoſe griefs paſſed, and all is (God be than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked quiet) &amp; likely right well to proſper in wealthfull peare vnder your couſins my children, if God ſend them life and you loue. Of which two things, the leſſe loſſe were they, by whom though God did his pleaſure, yet ſhould the Realme alway finde Kings, and peraduenture as good Kings. But if you among your ſelues in a childes raigne fall at debate, many a good man ſhall periſh, and haply he to and ye to, ere this land finde peace againe. Wherfore in theſe laſt wordes that euer I looke to ſpeake with you, I exhorte you and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire you all, for the loue that you haue euer borne to mée: for the loue that I haue euer borne vnto you: for the loue that our Lord beareth to vs all, from this time forward all griefes forgotten, eche of you loue other.

And therewithall the King no longer induring to ſit vp, laid him downe on his ryghte ſide, his face toward them: and none was there preſent that could refraine from wéeping.

<pb n="764" facs="tcp:18151:390"/>
vp in greate haſte, not in good ſpéede, with a ſober compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye. Now was the King in hys waye to <hi>London</hi> gone from <hi>Northampton,</hi> when the Dukes of <hi>Glocester</hi> and <hi>Buckingham</hi> came thither, where remained behinde the Lord <hi>Riuers</hi> the Kings vncle, intending on the morrowe to followe the King, and be with him at <hi>Stonie Stratforde,</hi> xij. myles thence, earelye or he departed. So was there made that nighte muche friendlye cheare betwéene theſe two Dukes and the Lord <hi>Riuers</hi> a great whyle. But incontinent after that they were openlye with greate curteſie departed, and the Lorde <hi>Riuers</hi> lodged, the Dukes ſecretely with a fewe of theyr moſte priuie friendes, ſet them down in counſaile, wherein they ſpent a great parte of the nighte. And at theyr riſing in the dawning of the day, they ſente out priuilye to theyr ſeruantes in theyr Innes and lodgings about, giuing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> commaundement, to make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues ſhortly readie, for their Lordes were to horſſebackewarde. Uppon whyche meſſages, manye of theyr folke were attendaunt, when ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye of the Lord <hi>Riuers</hi> ſeruauntes were vnreadye. Nowe had theſe Dukes taken alſo into theyr cuſtody the Keyes of the Inne, that none ſhoulde paſſe forth without their lice<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. And ouer thys, in the highe waye, towarde <hi>Stonie Stratforde,</hi> where the King laye, they hadde beſtowed certaine of theyr folke, that ſhoulde ſende backe againe, and compell to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, anye man that were gotten out of <hi>Northampton,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde <hi>Stonie Stratforde,</hi> tyll they ſhoulde giue other licence. For as much as the Dukes the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded for the ſhew of theyr diligence, to be the firſte that ſhoulde that daye at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tende vpon the Kings highneſſe out of that Towne: thus bare they folke in hande. But when the Lord <hi>Riuers</hi> vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode the Gates cloſed, and the wayes on euery ſide beſet, neyther his ſeruauntes nor himſelfe ſuffered to goe out, perceiuing wel ſo great a thing without his knowledge not begun for naughte, comparing thys manner preſent, wyth hys laſt nights chéere, in ſo fewe houres ſo great a change, maruellouſly miſliked.

and kéepe himſelfe cloſe he would not, leaſt he ſhould ſéeme to hyde himſelf for ſome ſecrete fear of his own fault, wherof he ſaw no ſuch cauſe in hymſelf. He determined vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſuretie of his own conſcience, to go boldelie to them, and inquire what this matter mighte meane, whome as ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And when he beganne (as he was a very wel ſpoken man) in goodly wiſe to excuſe himſelfe, they tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed not the ende of his aunſweare, but ſhortly tooke hym,<note place="margin">The L.

And as ſoone as they came in hys preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, they light adown with all their companye about them. To whom the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> ſayd, go afore Gentlemen, and yeomen kéepe your roomes.</p>
            <p>And thus in goodly aray, they came to the King, and on theyr knées in verye humble wyſe ſalued his grace, whiche receyued them in very ioyous and amiable maner, nothing earthlye knowing nor miſtruſting as yet.

            <p>All which things theſe Dukes wiſt well, were done for good purpoſes and neceſſarie, by the whole counſaile at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>

Yea my liege quoth the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> they haue kept theyr dealing in theſe matters farre fro the knowledge of your good grace. And forthwyth they areſted the Lord <hi>Richard</hi> and ſir <hi>Th. Vaugha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </hi> Knight, in the Kings preſence, and brought the king and al back vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Northampton,</hi> where they tooke againe further Counſell. And there they ſent away fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the King, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it pleaſed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and ſet new ſeruaunts about him, ſuch as liked better the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> than him. At which dealing he wept, and was nothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, but it booted not. And at dinner, the Duke of <hi>Glocester</hi> ſente a diſhe from his owne table to the Lord <hi>Riuers,</hi> pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to be of good cheare, all ſhould be well ynough. And he thanked the Duke, and prayed the meſſenger to beare it to his nephew the Lord <hi>Richard,</hi> with the ſame meſſage for hys comforte, as one to whome ſuch aduerſitie was ſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge, but himſelfe had bin all his dayes in vre therewith, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore could beare it the better.

            <p>In this wiſe, the Duke of <hi>Glocester</hi> toke vppon hymſelfe the order and gouernaunce of the yong King, whom with muche honoure and humble reuerence, hée conueyed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward toward the Citie.

About whom he founde much heauineſſe, rumble, haſt and buſineſſe, cariage and conueyaunce of hyr ſtuffe into San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuarie, cheſtes, coffers, packes, fardels, truſſed all on mens backes, no man vnoccupied, ſome lading, ſome going, ſome diſcharging, ſome comming for more, ſome breaking down the walles to bring in the next way, and ſome yet drewe to them to helpe to carry a wrong way.</p>
            <p>The Quéene hir ſelfe ſate alone alowe on the ruſhes al deſolate and diſmayde, whome the Archebiſhoppe comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the beſte manner he coulde, ſhewing hir that he tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, the matter was nothing ſo ſore as ſhe toke it for, and that he was putte in good hope and out of feare by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meſſage
<pb n="768" facs="tcp:18151:392"/>
ſent him from the Lord <hi>Chamberlaine:</hi> Ah wo worth hym (quoth ſhe) for he is one of them that laboureth to deſtroye me and my bloud.</p>
            <p>Madam (quoth he) be yée of good chéere, for I aſſure you, if they Crowne any other King than your ſon, whom they nowe haue with them, we ſhall on the morrowe Crowne hys brother, whom you haue here with you. And here is the greate ſeale, whyche in likewiſe as that noble Prince your huſbande deliuered it vnto me, ſo héere I deliuer it vnto you, to the vſe and behoofe of your ſonne, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he betooke hir the greate ſeale, and departed home a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, yet in the dawning of the daye. By whiche time, he mighte in his chamber windowe, ſée all the <hi>Thamis</hi> full of boates of the Duke of <hi>Glocesters</hi> ſeruauntes, watching that no man ſhoulde go to Sanctuarie, nor none could paſſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearched. Then was there great commotion and murmur, as well in other places about, as ſpecially in the Citie, the people diuerſly diuining vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this deling. And ſome Lords, Knightes, and Gentlemen, eyther for fauour of the Quéen, or for feare of themſelues, aſſembled in ſundry companies, and wente flockmeale in harneys: and manye alſo, for that they reckoned thys demeanour attempted, not ſo ſpeciallye againſt the other Lords, as againſt the King himſelfe in the diſturbaunce of his Coronation. But then by and by the Lordes aſſembled togither, towarde whiche méeting, the Archbiſhoppe of <hi>Yorke</hi> fearing that it woulde be aſcribed (as it was indéede) to his ouermuch lightneſſe, that he ſo ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainely hadde yéelded vppe the greate ſeale to the Quéene to whom the cuſtodie thereof nothing perteyned, wythout ſpeciall commaundement of the King ſecretely ſent for the ſeale againe, and brought it with him after the cuſtomable manner. And at this méeting, the Lorde <hi>Haſting,</hi> whoſe trouth toward y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king, no man doubted nor néeded to doubt, perſwaded the Lordes to beléeue, that the Duke of <hi>Glocester</hi> was ſure and faſtly faithfull to his Prince, &amp; that the Lord <hi>Riuers</hi> and Lorde <hi>Richarde,</hi> with the other Knightes,
<pb n="769" facs="tcp:18151:392"/>
were for matters attempted by them againſt the Dukes of <hi>Glocester</hi> and <hi>Buckingham,</hi> put vnder areſt for their ſuretie, not for the Kings ieopardie: and that they were alſo in ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde, and there no longer ſhoulde remayne than till the matter were, not by the Dukes onely, but alſo by all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Lords of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Kings counſayle indifferently examyned, &amp; by other diſcretions ordered, and eyther iudged or appeaſed.</p>
            <p>But one thing he aduiſed them beware, that they iudged not the matter too farre forth, ere they knew the trueth, nor turning theyr priuate grudges into the common hurte, yr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and prouoking men vnto anger, and diſturbing the Kings coronation, toward which the Dukes were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming vp, that they might peraduenture bring the matter ſo farre out of ioynte, that it ſhoulde neuer be broughte in frame a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. Whiche ſtrife if it ſhould happe, as it were lykely, to come to a fielde, though both parties were in all things equal, yet ſhoulde the aucthoritie be on that ſide where the King is himſelfe. With theſe perſwaſions of the Lord <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtings,</hi> whereof part himſelfe beleeued, of parte he wiſt the contrarie, theſe commotions were ſomwhat appeaſed, but ſpecially by that, that the Dukes of <hi>Glocester</hi> and <hi>Buckingha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </hi> wer ſo néere, and came ſo ſhortly on with the king, in none other manner, with none other voyce or ſemblance than to his coronation, cauſing the fame to be blowen about, that theſe Lords and Knights which were taken, had contriued the deſtruction of the dukes of <hi>Glocester</hi> and <hi>Buckingham,</hi> and of other the noble bloud of the Realme, to the end that the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues would alone demeane and gouern the King at their pleaſure.</p>
            <p>And for the coulourable proofe therof, ſuch of the Dukes ſeruauntes as rode with the cartes of their ſtuffe that were taken (among which ſtuffe no maruel thoughe ſome were harneys, which at the breaking vppe of the houſholde, muſt néedes eyther be brought awaye, or caſt away) they ſhewed vnto the people all the wayes as they went, loe héere be the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

            <p>This deuiſe albeit that it made the matter to wiſe men more vnlikely, well perceyuing that the intendours of ſuch a purpoſe would rather haue hadde theyr harneys on their backes than to haue bound them vppe in barrels, yet much part of the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> people were therwith very wel ſatiſfied, and ſayd it were almoyſe to hang them.</p>
            <p>When the King approched néere to the Citie, <hi>Edmonde Shaa</hi> Goldſmith, then Maior, with <hi>William White,</hi> &amp; <hi>Iohn Matthew</hi> Sherifes, and al the other Aldermen in Scarlet, with fiue hundered Horſſe of the Citizens in violet, recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued him reuerently at <hi>Harneſey,</hi> and ryding from thence, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companyed<note place="margin">The Kings co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p>But the Duke of <hi>Gloucester</hi> bare hym in open ſight ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerently to the Prince, with all ſemblaunce of lowlineſſe, that from the great obloquie in which he was ſo late before, he was ſodainly fallen in ſo gret truſt, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> at the counſel next aſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bled, he was made the only ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, choſe and thought moſt méete, to be Protector of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> King and hys Realme, ſo (that<note place="margin">The protectour made.</note> were it deſtenie, or were it follie) the Lambe was betaken to the Woolfe to kéepe.

            <p>Nowe all were it, ſo that that the Protector ſo ſore thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted for the finiſhing of that he had begunne, that thought euery daye a yeare, till it were atchéeued, yet durſte hée

And that by hir done to none other intente, but to bring all the Lordes in oblo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quie, and murmure of the people. As thoughe they were not to be truſted with the Kings brother, that by the aſſente of the Nobles of the lande, were appointed as the Kings neareſt friendes, to the tuition of hys owne royall perſon.

            <p>Nowe then, if ſhée doubte, leaſte hée mighte be fetched from hir, is it not likely ynough that ſhe ſhall ſende hym ſome where out of the Realme?

And if ſhe might happen to bring that to paſſe, (as it were no great maiſtrie, we letting hir alone) all the world would ſay, that we were a wiſe ſorte of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>failours aboute a King, that let his brother be caſte awaye vnder our noſes. And therfore, I enſure you faithfully for my minde, I wil rather maugre hir mind, fetch him away,

than leaue him there, till hir frowardneſſe and fonde feare conuey him away. And yet wil I breake no Sa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ctuarie ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.

            <p>Yet will I not ſaye naye, but that it is a déede of pitie, that ſuch men as the ſea, or their euil dettours haue brought in pouertie, ſhold haue ſome place of libertie, to kéepe theyr bodies out of the daunger of their cruel creditours.</p>
            <p>And alſo, if the Crown happen (as it hath done) to come in queſtion, whyle eyther parte taketh other as Traytors, I wil wel there be ſome places of refuge for both.</p>
            <p>But as for théeues, of whiche, theſe places be full, and which neuer fall from the crafte, after they once fall therto, it is pitie the Sanctuarie ſhoulde ſerue them.

            <p>A Sanctuarie ſerueth alway to defende the body of that man that ſtandeth in daunger abroade, not of greate hurte only, but alſo of lawful hurt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for againſt vnlawful harmes, neuer Pope nor King inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded to priuiledge any one place, for that priuiledge hath euery place: knoweth any man, any place, wherein it is lawfull one man to do an other wrong?</p>
            <p>That no man vnlawfully take hurt, that libertie, the K. the law, &amp; very nature, forbiddeth in euery place, &amp; maketh to that regarde, for euerye man euerye place a Sanctuarie.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="777" facs="tcp:18151:396"/>But where a man is by lawfull meanes in peryll, there néedeth he the tuition of ſome ſpeciall priuiledge, which is the onely ground and cauſe of all Sanctuaries: from which neceſſitie, this noble Prince is farre, whoſe loue to his King, nature and kindred proueth, whoſe innocencie to all the world, his tender youth proueth, and ſo Sanctuarie, as for him, neither none he néedeth, nor alſo none can haue.</p>
            <p>Men come not to Sa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ctuarie, as they come to Baptiſme, to require it by theyr Godfathers, he muſt aſke it himſelf, that muſt haue it, and reaſon, ſith no man hath cauſe to haue it, but whoſe conſcience of his owne fault maketh him fayne, néede to require it: what will then hath yonder babe? which and if he had diſcretion to require it, if néede were, I dare ſay would now be ryght angrie wyth them that kéepe hym there: and I would thynke without any ſcruple of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, without any breach of priuiledge, to be ſomwhat more homely wyth them that be there Sanctuarie men in déede.</p>
            <p>For if one goe to Sanctuarie with an others mans goods, why ſhould not the King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> leauing his body at libertie, ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the partie of his goods, euen wythin the Sanctuarie? for neyther Kyng nor Pope can gyue any place ſuche a priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that it ſhall diſcharge a man of hys debtes, being able to pay: and with that, dyuers of the Clergie that were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, whither they ſaid it for his pleaſure, or as they thought agréed playnely, that by the law of God and of the Church, the goods of a Sanctuarie man ſhoulde be deliuered in pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of hys debtes, and ſtollen goods to the owner, &amp; onely lybertie reſerued hym to get hys liuing with the labour of hys handes, verily (quoth the Duke) I thynke you ſay very trueth, and what if a mans wyfe will take Sanctuarie, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe liſt to runne from hir huſband?

<pb n="778" facs="tcp:18151:397"/>
hys maiſter muſt let him alone. And as ſimple as that ſample is, yet is there leſſe reaſon in our caſe than in that, for therein, thoughe it be a chyldiſhe feare, yet is there, at the leaſtwyſe ſome feare, and herein is there none at all. And verily, I haue often heard of Sanctuarie men, but I neuer heard earſt of Sanctuarie children. And therefore, as for the concluſion of my mynde, who ſo may haue deſerued to néede it, if they thinke it for their ſuertie, let them kéepe it. But he can bée no Sanctuarie man, that neyther hath wiſedome to deſire it, nor malice to deſerue it, whoſe life or libertie, can by no lawfull proceſſe ſtand in ieoperdie. And he that taketh one out of Sanctuarie to doe him good, I ſaye playnely, that he breaketh no Sanctuarie.</p>
            <p>When the Duke had done, the Temporall men whole, and a good part of the ſpiritual alſo, thinkyng no hurt earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ment toward the yong babe, condiſcended in effect, that if he were not delyuered, he ſhould be fetched. Howbeit, they thought it all beſt, in the auoyding of all manner of rumor, that the Lorde Cardinall ſhould firſt aſſay to get him with hir good will. And therevppon, all the Counſell came vnto the Starre Chamber at <hi>Westminster,</hi> and the Lorde Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall, leauyng the Protector with the Counſell in the Starre Chamber, departed into the Sanctuarie to the Quéene, with dyuers other Lordes with him, were it for the reſpect of hys honour, or that ſhée ſhould by preſence of ſo many perceyue that thys errande was not one mans mynde: or were it, for that the Protector intended not in this matter, to truſt any one man alone, or elſe, that if ſhée finally were determyned to kéepe hym, ſome of that compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, had happily ſecrete inſtruction incontinent, maugre hir mynde, to take him, and to leaue hir no reſpite to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uey him, which ſhée was lykely to mynde after this matter broken to hir, if hir time would in any wiſe ſerue hir.</p>

But he is in no ieoperdie, nor hath no néede thereof: would God he had not. Troth the Protector (I pray God he may proue a Protector) troweth he that I perceyue not where vnto hys paynted proceſſe draweth? It is not honorable that the Duke byde here: It were comfortable for them both, that he were with his brother, bycauſe the King lacketh a play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fellowe be ye ſure. I pray God ſend them both better play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fellowes than hym that maketh ſo high a matter vpon ſuch a tryfelyng pretext: As though there coulde none be founde to play wyth the King, but if hys brother that hath no luſte to play for ſickeneſſe, come out of Sanctuarie out of his ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde to play with him. As though Princes as yong as they he, could not play but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

For when my Lorde my huſbande was baniſhed, and thruſt out of hys Kingdome, I fled hither, being great with childe, and here I bare the Prince.

            <p>The Lord Cardinall perceyuing that the Quéene war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed euer the longer the further off, and alſo that ſhe began to kindle and chafe, and ſpeake more byting words againſt the Protector, and ſuch as he neither beléeued, &amp; was alſo loath to heare, he ſaid to hir for a finall concluſion, that he woulde no longer diſpute the matter, but if ſhe were content to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer the Duke to him, and to the other Lordes preſent, he durſt lay his owne body and ſoule both in pledge, not onely for his ſuertie, but alſo for his eſtate. And if ſhe woulde giue them a reſolute anſwere to the contrarie, he woulde forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with depart there with all, and ſhift who ſo would with this buſineſſe afterwardes, for he neuer intended more to moue hir in that matter, in which ſhe thought that he and al other alſo ſaue hirſelf lacked either wit or truth.

And therwith ſhe kiſſed him, &amp; bleſſed him, turned hir back &amp; wept, &amp; went hir way, leauing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> child wéeping as faſt. When y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Lord Cardinal, &amp; thoſe other Lords w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> him, had receiued this yong duke, they brought him into y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ſtar Chamber, where y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Protector tooke him in his armes, &amp; kiſſed him, with theſe words: now wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come my Lord euen w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> al my very hart. And he ſaid in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> of<note place="margin">O diſsimulation.</note> likelihood as he thought.

            <p>¶ When the Protector had both y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> children in his hands,<note place="margin">This that is here betvveene this marke ¶ and this marke *vvas not vvrit<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ten by him in english but is tranſlated out of this Hiſtorie vvhich he vvrote in Lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin.</note> he opened himſelf more boldly, both to certaine other men, &amp; alſo chiefly to y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Duke of <hi>Buckingha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> Although I know y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thought y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> this Duke was priuie to al y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Protectors cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, euen fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the beginning, &amp; ſome of the Protectors friends ſaid, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> the duke was the firſt mouer of the Protector to this matter, ſending a priuie meſſenger vnto him, ſtraight after K. <hi>Edwards</hi> death. But other againe which knew better the ſubtil wit of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Protector, denie y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> he euer opened his enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe to y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> duke, vntil he had brought to paſſe y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> things before rehearſed. But whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had impriſoned y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Quéens kinſfolks, &amp; gotten both hir ſonnes into his owne hands, then he ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the reſt of his purpoſe with leſſe feare to them whom he thought méet for y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> matter, &amp; ſpecially to the Duke, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing woon to his purpoſe, he thought his ſtrength more than half increaſed. The matter was broken vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> duke by ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till folkes, &amp; ſuch as were their crafts maſters in the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of ſuch wicked deuiſes: who declared vnto him that the yong king was offended with him for his kinſfolks ſake, &amp; if he were euer able he would reuenge them. Who woulde prick him forward thervnto if they eſcaped (for they would remember their impriſonment) or elſe if they were put to deathe, without doubte the yong King woulde be carefull
<pb n="787" facs="tcp:18151:401"/>
for their deathes, whoſe impriſonment was grieuous vnto him. And that with repenting the Duke ſhould nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile, for there was no way left to redéeme his offence by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefites, but he ſhoulde ſooner deſtroy himſelfe than ſaue the king, who with his brother and his kinſfolkes he ſawe in ſuch places impriſoned, as the Protector might wyth a beck deſtroy them all: and that it were no doubt but he woulde doe it in déede, if there were any new enterpriſe attempted. And that it was lykely, that as the Protector had prouided priuie garde for hymſelfe, ſo had he ſpyalles for the Duke, and traynes to catche him, if he ſhoulde be agaynſt hym, and that peraduenture from them, whom he leaſt ſuſpected. For the ſtate of things and the diſpoſitions of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were then ſuch, that a man coulde not well tell whom he mighte truſt, or whom he might feare.*</p>
            <p>Theſe things and ſuch lyke, beyng beaten into the Dukes mynde, brought him to that point, that where he had repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the way that he had entred, yet woulde he goe forthe in the ſame, and ſince he had once begunne, he woulde ſtoute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly goe throughe. And therefore to this wicked enterpriſe which he beléeued coulde not be voyded, he bent hymſelfe, and went through and determined, that ſince the common miſchiefe could not be amended, he would turne it as much as he might to his owne commoditie.</p>
            <p>Then it was agréed, that the Protector ſhoulde haue the Dukes aide to make him King, and that the Protectors on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lawfull ſonne ſhould marrie the Dukes daughter, &amp; that the Protector ſhould graunt him the quiet poſſeſſion of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ledome of Hertford, which he claimed as his inheritance, and could neuer obtayne it in King <hi>Edwardes</hi> tyme. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides theſe requeſts of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> duke, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Protector of his own minde promiſed hym a great quantitie of the kings treaſure, and of his houſholde ſtuffe. And when they were thus at a poynt betwéene themſelues, they went about to prepare for y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation of the yong king as they would haue it ſéeme. And that they myght turne both the eyes and mindes of men fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

perceiuing of their drifts other where, the Lords being ſent for from all partes of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Realme, came thick to y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ſolemnitie. But the Protector, &amp; the duke after that, that they had ſent y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Lord Cardinal, the Archbiſhop of <hi>Yorke</hi> then Lord Chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Elie,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Lord <hi>Stanley,</hi> &amp; the lord <hi>Haſtings</hi> then Lorde Chamberlaine, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> many other noble men* to common &amp; deuiſe about the coronation in one place, as faſt were they in another place, contriuing the contrarie, and to make the Protector King. To which Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cell, albeit there were adhibited very few, &amp; they were ſecret: yet began there here &amp; there about, ſome maner of muttering among y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as though all ſhould not long be wel, though they ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wyſt what they feared, nor wherefore, were it that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuch great things mens hartes of a ſecret inſtinct of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture miſgiue them. As the ſea without winde ſwelleth of himſelf ſomtime before a tempeſt: or were it that ſome one man happily ſomewhat perceiuing, filled many men with ſuſpition, though he ſhewed few men what he knew. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit ſomewhat the dealing it ſelf made men to muſe on the matter, though the Councell were cloſe. For by little and little, all folke withdrew from the Tower, &amp; drew to <hi>Croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies</hi> in <hi>Biſhops gate ſtreete.</hi> where the Protector kept his houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold. The Protector had the reſort, the King in manner de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate.</p>
            <p>While ſome for their buſineſſe made ſute to them that had the doing, ſome were by their friends ſecretly warned, that it might happily turne them to no good, to be too muche attendant about the King without the Protectors appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which remoued alſo diuers of the Princes olde ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunts from him, and ſet new about him.</p>
            <p>Thus many things co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming togither, partly by chaunce, partly of purpoſe, cauſed at length not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon people onely, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> wound w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the wind, but wiſe men alſo, &amp; ſome Lords eke to marke the matter, &amp; muſe thereon, ſo farre forth, that the Lorde <hi>Stanley</hi> that was after Earle of <hi>Darbie,</hi> wiſely miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted it, and ſayde vnto the Lorde <hi>Haſtings,</hi> that he muche
<pb n="785" facs="tcp:18151:402"/>
miſlyked theſe two ſeueral Councels. For while we (quoth he) talke of one matter in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> one place, little wote we wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they talke in the other place. My Lorde (quoth the Lorde <hi>Haſtings</hi>) of my life neuer doubt you: for while one man is there, which is neuer thence, neuer can there be thing once moued, that ſhould ſound amiſſe toward me, but it ſhoulde be in mine eares ere it were well out of their mouthes.</p>
            <p>This ment he by <hi>Catesby,</hi> whiche was of hys néere ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete<note place="margin">Catesbie.</note> counſell, and whom he verie familiarly vſed, and in his moſt weightie matters put no man in ſo ſpeciall truſt, reckening himſelfe to no man ſo liefe, ſithe he well wyſte there was no man ſo muche to him beholden as was this <hi>Catesby,</hi> which was a man well learned in the lawes of this land, and by the ſpeciall fauour of the Lorde Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine, in good authoritie, and much rule bare in all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of <hi>Leycester,</hi> where the Lorde Chamberleynes power chiefely laye. But ſurely great pitie was it, that he had not had eyther more truth or leſſe wit. For his diſſimulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on onely, kept all that miſchiefe vp. In whom if the Lorde <hi>Haſtings,</hi> had not put ſo ſpeciall truſt, the Lorde <hi>Stanley</hi> and he had departed with diuers other Lordes, and broken all the daunce, for many yll ſignes that he ſawe, which he now conſtrues all to the beſt. So ſurely thought he, that there coulde be no harme toward him in that Councell intended, where <hi>Catesby</hi> was.</p>
            <p>And of truth the Protector, and the Duke of <hi>Buckingham.</hi> made verie good ſemblaunce vnto the Lorde <hi>Haſtings,</hi> and kept him much in companie. And vndoubtedly, the Protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor loued him well, and loth was to haue loſt him, ſauing for feare leaſt his lyfe ſhoulde haue quaiied their purpoſe. For which cauſe he moued <hi>Catesby</hi> to proue wyth ſome wordes caſt out a farre off, whether he coulde thinke it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to winne the Lorde <hi>Haſtings</hi> vnto their part. But <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesby</hi> whether he aſſayed him, or aſſayed him not, reported vnto them, that he founde him ſo faſt, and heard him ſpeake ſo terrible words, that he durſt no further breake.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="790" facs="tcp:18151:403"/>And of trueth the Lorde Chamberlayne of verye truſt ſhewed vnto <hi>Catesby</hi> the diſtruſt that other began to haue in the matter. And therefore hée fearing leaſt theyr moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on might with the Lorde <hi>Haſtings</hi> miniſhe his credence, wherevnto onely all the matter leaned, procured the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector haſtily to rid him. And much the rather, for that he truſted by his death to obtayne muche of the rule that the Lorde <hi>Haſtings</hi> bare in his Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey: the onely deſire wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, was the allectiue that induced him to be partner and one ſpeciall contriuer of all this horrible treaſon.</p>
            <p>Wherevpon ſoone after, that is to wit, on the Fryday the thirtéenth day of June, many Lordes aſſembled in the Tower, and there ſat in Councell, deuiſing the honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſolemnitie of the Kings Coronation, of which the tyme appoynted then ſo neare approched, that the Pageantes and ſubtiltyes were in making daye and night at <hi>Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi> and much vitayle kylled therefore, that afterward was caſt away.</p>
            <p>Theſe Lordes ſo ſitting together communing of thys matter, the Protector came in amongſt them firſt about. ix. of the clocke, ſaluting them courteouſly, and excuſing hym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf that he had bene from them ſo long, ſaying merily that he had bene a ſléeper that day.</p>
            <p>And after a little talkyng with them, he ſayde vnto the Byſhop of <hi>Elie:</hi> My Lorde you haue verye good Strawbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries at your Garden in <hi>Holborne;</hi> I require you let vs haue a meſſe of them. Gladly my Lorde (quoth he) woulde God I had ſome better thing as readie to your pleaſure as that. And therwith in all the haſt he ſent hys ſeruant for a meſſe of Strawberies.</p>
            <p>The Protector ſet the Lordes faſt in communing, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon praying them to ſpare him for a little while, departed thence. And ſoone after one houre, betwéene x. and xj. he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned into the Chamber among them all, changed with a wonderfull ſoure angrie countenance, knitting y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> browes, frowning &amp; fretting, &amp; gnawing on his lippes, &amp; ſo ſat hym

downe in his place, all the Lordes much diſmayde and ſore maruelling of this manner of ſodaine change, &amp; what thing ſhould him aile. Then, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had ſitten ſtill a while, thus he began: What were they worthy to haue that compaſſe and imagine the deſtruction of mée, beyng ſo néere of bloud vnto the King, and Protector of his Royall perſon and his Realme? At this queſtion, all the Lordes ſat ſore aſtonyed, muſing much by whom this queſtion ſhoulde be ment, of which euery man wyſt himſelfe cleare.</p>
            <p>Then the Lord Chamberlaine, as he that for the loue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene them thoughte he might be boldeſt with him, aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered and ſayde, that they were worthy to be puniſhed as heynous traytors, whatſoeuer they were. And all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther affyrmed the ſame. That is (quoth he) yonder ſorcereſſe my brothers wyfe, and other with hir, meaning y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Quéene.

And therewith he plucked vp his dublet ſléeue to his elbow vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his left arme, where he ſhewed a we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh withered arme, and ſmal, as it was neuer other.

<pb n="792" facs="tcp:18151:404"/>
And alſo, no manne was there preſent but well knew that his arme was euer ſuche ſince hys byrth.

            <p>What (quoth the Protector) thou ſerueſt me I wéene with iffes and with andes, I tell thée they haue ſo done, and that I will make good on thy bodye traytour: and therewith as in a great anger, he clapped his fyſt vpon the bourd a great rappe. At which token giuen, one cried treaſon without the Chamber. Therewith a doore clapped, and in come there ruſhing men in harneſſe, as many as the Chamber myght holde. And anone the Protector ſayd to the Lord <hi>Haſtings,</hi> I arreſt thée Traytour: What mée my Lord? (quoth he) yea thée traitour quoth the Protector.

            <p>It booted him not to aſke why, but heauily tooke a Prieſt at auenture, and made a ſhort ſhrift, for a longer would not be ſuffred, the Protector made ſo much haſt to dinner, which he might not goe to, till this were done, for ſauing of hys othe.

            <p>A maruellous caſe is it to heare eyther the warnings of

that he ſhoulde haue boyded, or the tokens of that he coulde not voyde, for the ſelfe night next before his death, the Lord <hi>Stanley</hi> ſente a truſtie ſecrete meſſenger vnto him at myd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night in all the haſte, requiring him to riſe and ride awaye with hym, for he was diſpoſed vtterly no longer to byde, he<note place="margin">The Lorde Stanleys dreame.</note> hadde ſo fearefull a dreame, in whiche him thoughte that a Boare with his tuſkes ſo raſed them both by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> heads, that the bloud ran about both their ſhoulders. And for as much as the Protector gaue the Boare for his cogniſance, this dreame made ſo fearefull an impreſſion in his heart, that he was throughly determined no longer to tarrie, but had hys horſſe readie, if the Lord <hi>Haſtings</hi> would goe wyth hym to ride yet ſo farre the ſame nighte, that they ſhoulde be out of daunger ere daye. Ha good Lord (quoth the Lorde <hi>Haſtings</hi> to this meſſenger) leaneth my Lorde thy maiſter ſo muche to ſuche trifles, and hath ſuch fayth in dreames, whiche ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his owne feare fantaſieth, or doe riſe in the nightes reſt by reaſon of his day thoughts?

And therefore go to thy maiſter manne and commende me to him, and pray him to be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and haue no feare: for I enſure him I am as ſure of the manne that hée woteth of, as I am of mine owne hande.

            <p>Certaine is it alſo, that in riding towards the Tower the ſame morning in whiche he was beheaded, his Horſſe
<pb n="795" facs="tcp:18151:405"/>
twice or thrice ſtumbled with him, almoſte to the falling, which thing albeit eache man wote wel dayly happeneth to them to whom no ſuch miſchance is toward, yet hath it bin of an olde rite and cuſtome, obſerued as a token oftentimes notably foregoing ſome great miſfortune.</p>
            <p>Now this that followeth, was no warning but an enuy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſkorne.</p>
            <p>The ſame morning ere he was vp, came a Knight vnto him, as it were of curteſie, to accompany him to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, but of trueth ſent by the Protector to haſt him thither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes, with whom he was of ſecrete confederacie in that purpoſe, a meane man at that time, and nowe of great au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie.</p>
            <p>This Knight when it happened the Lorde Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layne by the waye to ſtay his horſſe, and commune a while with a Prieſt whom he mette in the <hi>Tower streete,</hi> brake his tale, and ſayde merily to him, what my Lorde I praye you come on, whereto talke you ſo long with that Prieſte, you haue no néede of a Prieſt yet: and therewith he laughed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hym, as though he would ſaye, yée ſhall haue ſoone. But ſo little wiſt the tother what he mente, and ſo little miſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, that he was neuer merier, nor neuer ſo ful of good hope in his life, which ſelfe thing is often ſéene a ſigne of change. But I ſhal rather let any thing paſſe me, than y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> vaine ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of mans minde ſo neare his death.</p>
            <p>Upon the very Tower Wharfe, ſo neare the place wher his head was off ſoone after, there met he with one <hi>Haſtings</hi> a Purſiuaunt of his owne name. And of theyr méeting in that place, he was put in remembraunce of another time, in whiche it hadde happened them before to méete in lyke manner togither in the ſame place. At whiche other tyme the Lord Chamberlain had bin accuſed vnto King <hi>Edward</hi> by the Lorde <hi>Riuers</hi> the Quéenes brother, in ſuche wiſe as he was for the while (but it laſted not long) far fallen into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Kings indignation, and ſtoode in great feare of himſelf. And for as muche as he now mette this Purſiuaunt in the ſame
<pb n="796" facs="tcp:18151:405"/>
place that ieopardie ſo well paſſed, it gaue hym great plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to talke with him thereof, with whom he hadde before talked thereof in the ſame place, whyle he was therin. And therefore he ſayde: Ah <hi>Haſtings</hi> arte thou remembred when I met thée here once with an heauie hearte? Yea my Lorde (quoth he) that remember I well, and thanked be God, they got no good, nor you no harme thereby.

               </gap>weſt as much as I knowe, whyche fewe knowe elſe as yet, and mo ſhal ſhortly. That ment he by the Lordes of the Quéenes kyndred that were taken before and ſhould that daye be beheaded at <hi>Ponfraite<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> which he well wiſt, but nothing ware that the Are hung o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer his own heade. In fayth man (quoth he) I was neuer ſo ſorie, nor neuer ſtoode in ſo great dreade in my life, as I dyd when thou and I mette here. And lo howe the worlde is turned, nowe ſtand mine enimies in the daunger (as thou mayeſt happe to heare more hereafter) and I neuer in my life ſo mery, nor neuer in ſo great ſuretie.</p>
            <p>O good God the blindneſſe of our mortall nature, when he moſt feared, he was in good ſuretie, when he reckened himſelf ſureſt, he loſt his life, &amp; that within two hours after.</p>
            <p>Thus ended thys honourable man, a good Knight and a<note place="margin">The deſcription of the Lord Haſtings.</note> gentle, of greate aucthoritie with hys Prince, of lyuing ſomewhat diſſolute, playne and open to hys enimie, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete to his friend, eaſie to beguile, as he that of good hearte and courage foreſtudied no perilles: a louing man and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing wel beloued: very faithful and truſtie ynough, truſting too much. Now flew the fame of this Lords death ſwiftlye through the Citie, and ſo forth further about like a winde in euery mans eare.</p>
            <p>But the Protector immediately after dinner, intending to ſette ſome colour vpon the matter, ſent in all haſt for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſubſtantial men out of the Citie into the Tower. And at theyr comming, himſelfe with the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> ſtoode harneſſed in olde yll faring <hi>Briganders,</hi> ſuch as no man ſhoulde wéene that they would vouchſafe to haue put vpon
<pb n="796" facs="tcp:18151:406"/>
their backes, except that ſome ſodain neceſſitie had conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them.</p>
            <p>And then the Protectour ſhewed them, that the Lorde Chamberlaine and other of his conſpiracie had contriued to haue ſodainely deſtroyed hym, and the Duke, there the ſame daye in the Counſel. And what they intended further was as yet not well knowne. Of whiche their Treaſon hée neuer had knowledge before tenne of the clocke the ſame forenoone, which ſodain feare droue them to put on for their defence ſuche harneys as came next to hande. And ſo hadde God holpen them, that the miſchief turned vpon them that woulde haue done it. And thys he requyred them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port.</p>
            <p>Euery man aunſwered him fayre, as though no manne miſtruſted the matter, which of trothe no manne beléeued. Yet for the further appeaſing of the peoples minde, he ſent immediately after dinner in al haſt, an Herault of armes, wyth a Proclamation to be made throughe the Citie in the<note place="margin">The Protectors proclamation.</note> Kyngs name, conteyning, that the Lord <hi>Haſtings</hi> with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe other of his trayterous purpoſe, had before conſpired the ſame daye, to haue ſlaine the Lorde Protectour, and the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> ſitting in the Counſell, and after to haue taken vpon them to rule the King, and the realme, at theyr pleaſure, and thereby to pill and ſpoyle whome they liſt vncontrolled. And much matter there was in that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, deuiſed to the ſlaunder of the Lorde Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layne, as that he was an euil. Counſayler to the Kings fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, inticing him to manye things highly redounding to the miniſhing of his honour, and to the vniuerſall hurte of his Realme by his euill companye, ſiniſter procuring, and vngracious enſample, as wel in manye other things, as in the dicious liuing and inordinate abuſion of hys bodie, both wyth manye other, and alſo ſpeciallye wyth <hi>Shores</hi> wiſe, whiche was one alſo of hys moſte ſecret counſaile of thys heynons treaſon, with whom he laye nightlye, and namely the night laſt paſt nexte before his death, ſo that it
<pb n="797" facs="tcp:18151:406"/>
was the leſſe maruayle, if vngratious liuing broughte him to an vnhappy ending, whiche he was nowe putte vnto, by the moſte dread commaundemente of the Kings highneſſe, and of his honorable and faythfull counſayle, bothe for hys demerites, being ſo openly taken in hys falſlye conceyued treaſon, and alſo leaſte the delaying of his execution, might haue encouraged other miſchieuous perſons part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of his conſpiracie, to gather and aſſemble themſelues togither, in making ſome greate commotion for hys dely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraunce: whoſe hope being nowe by his well deſerued death politikely repreſſed, al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> realm ſhould by gods grace, reſt in good quiet and peace.</p>
            <p>Now was this proclamation made wythin two houres after that he was beheaded, and it was ſo curiouſly indited, and ſo faire written in parchment, in ſo well a ſette hand, and therewith of it ſelfe ſo long a proceſſe, that euery childe might well perceyue that it was prepared before. For all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time betwéene his death and the proclayming, coulde ſkant haue ſufficed vnto the bare writing alone, all had it béene but in Paper, and ſcribled forth in haſte at aduenture. So that vpon the proclayming thereof, one that was ſcholema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of <hi>Paules,</hi> of chaunce ſtanding by, and comparing the ſhortneſſe of the time with the length of the matter, ſayd vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them that ſtoode about him, here is a gay goodly caſt, foule caſt away for haſte: and a Merchaunt aunſweared him, that it was written by prophecie. Nowe then by &amp; by, as it were for anger, not for couetiſe, the Protectour ſent into the houſe of <hi>Shores</hi> wife (for hir huſbande dwelled not with hyr) and ſpoyled hir of all that euer ſhe had, aboue the value of two or thrée thouſande marke, and ſent hyr body to priſon. And when he had a while layde vnto hyr (for the manner ſake) that ſhe wente aboute to bewitch him, and that ſhe was of counſaile with the Lord Cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>berlaine to deſtroy him: in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion when that no colour coulde faſten vppon theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, then he layde heynouſly to hir charge, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> thing that hir ſelfe could not denye, that all the world wiſt was true, and
<pb n="798" facs="tcp:18151:407"/>
that naytheleſſe euery manne laughed at, to heare it then ſo ſodainely, ſo highly taken, that ſhe was nought of hir body.</p>
            <p>And for this cauſe (as a good continent Prince, cleane and faultleſſe of himſelfe, ſente out of heauen into this vicious world for the amendment of mens manners) he cauſed the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> to put hyr to open penaunce, going before the Croſſe in Proceſſion, vpon a Sonday, with a Taper in hir hande. In whiche ſhe went in countenance and pace de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure ſo womanly, and albeit ſhe were out of al array ſaue hir kyrtle onlye, yet wente ſhe ſo faire and louely, namely while the wondering of the people caſte a comely rudde in hir chéekes (of which ſhe before had moſt miſſe,) y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hir great ſhame wanne hir much prayſe, among thoſe that wer more amorous of hir bodie, than curious of hir ſoule. And manye good folke alſo that hated hir liuing, and glad were to ſée ſin corrected: yet pitied they more hir penaunce, ethan reioyced therein, when they conſidered that the Protector procured it, more of a corrupt intent, than any vertuous affection.</p>
            <p>This woman was borne in <hi>London,</hi> worſhipfullye frien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,<note place="margin">The deſcription of Shores vvife.</note> honeſtly brought vp, and very wel maried, ſauing ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what too ſoone, hir huſband an honeſt Citizen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yong &amp; godly, and of good ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. But for as much as they were coupled ere ſhe were wel ripe, ſhe not very feruently loued, for who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhe neuer longed, which was happily the thing that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> more eaſily made hir incline vnto the Kings appetite, when hée required hir. Howbeit the reſpect of his royaltie, the hope of gay apparell, eaſe, pleaſure, and other wanton wealth, was able ſoone to pierce a ſoft tender hearte.</p>
            <p>But when the king had abuſed hir, anone hir huſband (as he was an honeſt ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; one y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> could his good, not preſuming to touch a Kings Concubine) left hir vp to him altogither.</p>
            <p>When the King died, the Lord Chamberlain tooke hyr, whiche in the Kings dayes, albeit he was ſore enamoured vpon hir, yet he forebare hir, eyther for reuerence, or for a certaine friendly faythfulneſſe. Proper ſhe was and fayre: nothing in hir bodie that you would haue chaunged, but if
<pb n="799" facs="tcp:18151:407"/>
you woulde haue wiſhed hir ſomewhat higher.</p>
            <p>Thus ſay they that knewe hir in hir youth. Albeit ſome that nowe ſée hir (for yet ſhe liueth) déeme hir neuer to haue bene wel viſaged, whoſe iudgement ſéemeth me ſomewhat like, as though men ſhould geſſe the beautie of one long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore departed, by hir ſcalpe taken out of the charnel houſe: for now is ſhe olde, leane, withered, and dryed vp, nothing left but riueld ſkin and hard bone. And yet being euen ſuch: who ſo wel aduiſe hir viſage, might geſſe and deuiſe, which parts how filled woulde make it a faire face. Yet delited not men ſo much in hir beautie as in hir pleaſaunt behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our. For a proper wit had ſhe, and coulde both reade well and write, merrie in companye, readie and quicke of aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, neyther mute nor full of bable, ſometime taunting without diſpleaſure, and not without diſporte.</p>
            <p>The King would ſay that he had thrée Concubines, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ch<note place="margin">King Edvvards three concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines.</note> in thrée diuerſe properties diuerſly excelled. One the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieſt, another the wylieſt, the thirde the holyeſt harlot in his Realme, as one whom no man could get out of the Church lightly to any place, but it were to his bed. The other two were ſomewhat greater perſonages, and natheleſſe of their humility content to be nameleſſe, &amp; to forbeare the praiſe of thoſe properties. But y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> merieſt was this <hi>Shors</hi> wife, in who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the King therfore tooke ſpeciall pleaſure. For many he had, but hir he loued, whoſe fauour to ſaye the troth (for ſinne it were to belie the Diuel) ſhe neuer abuſed to any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s hurt, but to manye a mannes comforte and reliefe: where the Kyng tooke diſpleaſure ſhe would mitigate and appeaſe his mynde: where men were out of fauour ſhée woulde bryng them in his grace. For manye that hadde highlye offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſhée obtayned pardon. Of great forfeytures ſhe gat men remiſſion. And finally, in many weightie ſutes ſhe ſtoode many men in great ſteade, eyther for none or very ſmall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes, and thoſe rather gaye than riche: eyther for that ſhe was content with the déede ſelfe well done, or for that ſhée delyted to bée ſued vnto, and to ſhewe what ſhée was able
<pb n="800" facs="tcp:18151:408"/>
to doe with the King, or for that wanton women and weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy be not al wayes couetous.</p>
            <p>I doubt not ſome ſhall thinke this woman to ſleyghte a thing to be written of, and ſet among the remembrances of great matters: whych they ſhall ſpeciallye thinke, that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilye ſhall eſtéeme hir onely by that they nowe ſée hir. But me ſéemeth the chaunce ſo muche the more worthy to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, in how much ſhe is nowe in the more beggerlye condition, vnfriended and worne out of acquaintaunce, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter good ſubſtaunce, after as great fauour with the Prince, after as greate ſute and ſéekyng to with all thoſe that thoſe dayes had buſineſſe to ſpéede, as manye other men were in theyr tymes, which be now famous only by the infamye of theyr yl déeds.

            <p>Now was it ſo deuiſed by the Protectour and his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayle, that the ſelfe daye in whych the Lord Chamberlayne was beheaded in the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> and aboute the ſelfe ſame houre, was there (not without his aſſent) beheaded at <hi>Ponfraite,</hi> the foreremembred Lords and Knightes that were taken from the King at <hi>Northampton</hi> and <hi>Stonie Stratforde.</hi> Which thing was done in the preſence, and by the order of ſir <hi>Richarde Ratcliffe</hi> Knight, whoſe ſeruice the Protectour<note place="margin">Sir Richarde Ratclife.</note> ſpecially vſed in that counſell, and in the execution of ſuch lawleſſe enterpriſes, as a man that had bene long ſecrete wyth him, hauing experience of the worlde, and a ſhrewde witte, ſhort and rude in ſpéech, rough and boyſterous of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauyour, bolde in miſchiefe, as farre from pitie as from al feare of God.</p>

            <p>After that King <hi>Edwarde</hi> the fourth hadde depoſed King <hi>Henrie</hi> the ſixth, and was in peaceable poſſeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> realm, determining himſelfe to marie, as it was requiſite both for himſelfe and for the Realme, he ſent ouer in Ambaſſade the Earle of <hi>Warwicke,</hi> with other noble men in his companye vnto <hi>Spaine,</hi> to intreate and conclude a mariage betwéene King <hi>Edwarde</hi> and the Kings daughter of <hi>Spaine.</hi> In which thyng the Earle of <hi>Warwicke</hi> founde the parties ſo towarde and willing, that he ſpéedilyé according to his inſtructions without any difficultie, brought the matter to very good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion.</p>
            <p>Now happened it, that in the meane ſeaſon there came to make ſute by petition to the king Dame <hi>Elizabeth Gray,</hi> which was after his. Quéene, at that time a Widowe, borne<note place="margin">Dame Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth Gray.</note> of noble bloude, ſpecially by hyr mother, whiche was Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of <hi>Bedforde,</hi> ere ſhe married the Lorde <hi>Woodfielde</hi> hyr Father. Howbeit this Dame <hi>Elizabeth</hi> hir ſelfe, being in ſeruice wyth Quéene <hi>Margaret,</hi> wife vnto King <hi>Henrie</hi> the ſixth, was maryed vnto one <hi>Iohn Gray</hi> an Eſquire, whom King <hi>Henrie</hi> made Knight, vppon the fielde that he had on <hi>Bernet Heath</hi> by <hi>Saint Albons</hi> againſt King <hi>Edwarde.</hi> And little while enioyed he that Knighthoode, for he was at the ſame fielde ſlaine.</p>
            <p>After which done, and the Earle of <hi>Warwicke</hi> being in his Ambaſſade aboute the afore remembred mariage, thys péere Ladie made humble ſute vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> King, that ſhe might be reſtored vnto ſuch ſmall landes as hir late huſbande had giuen hyr in ioynture.

<pb n="804" facs="tcp:18151:410"/>
not only pitied hir, but alſo waxed enamoured of hir. And takyng hir after ſecretly aſide, beganne to enter in talking more familiarly. Whoſe appetite when ſhe perceyued, ſhe vertuouſly denyed hym. But that did ſhe ſo wiſely, &amp; with ſo good maner, and words ſo wel ſet, that ſhe rather kindled his deſire than quenched it.</p>
            <p>And finallye, after manye a méeting, muche wooyng, and manye greate promiſes, ſhe well eſpyed the Kings af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection towarde hyr ſo greatelye encreaſed, that ſhée durſte ſomewhat the more boldely ſay hir minde, as to him whoſe heart ſhe perceyned more feruently ſet, than to fall off for a worde.</p>
            <p>And in concluſion, ſhe ſhewed him playne, that as ſhée wyſte hyr ſelfe to ſimple to be his wife, ſo thoughte ſhe hir ſelfe too good to be hys Concubine. The King muche mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelling at hir conſtancie, as hée that hadde not bene wonte elſe where to be ſo ſtiffelye ſayde naye, ſo muche eſtée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med hir continencie and chaſtitye, that hée ſette hyr ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue in the ſteade of poſſeſſion and riches, and thus takyng Counſayle of his deſire, determined in all poſſible haſte i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And albeit he woulde gladlye that ſhe ſhould take it wel, yet was at a point in his own minde, toke ſhe it well or otherwiſe. Howbeit ſomewhat to ſatiſfie hir, he ſayde, that albeit mariage beyng a Spiritual thing, oughte rather to be made for the reſpect of God, where hys grace enclyneth the parties to loue togtiher, as he truſted it was in hys, than for the regarde of any Temporall adua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage: yet naytheleſſe, him ſéemed that this mariage euen worldly conſidered, was not vnprofitable. For he reckened the amitie of no earthly Nation ſo neceſſarie for him, as the frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dſhip of his own, which he thought likly to beare him ſo muche the more heartie fauour, in that he diſdayned not to marie with one of his owne lande. And yet if outward ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aunce were thought ſo requiſite, he would finde the meanes
<pb n="806" facs="tcp:18151:411"/>
to enter therevnto, much better by other of his kinne, where all the parties coulde be contented, than to marye himſelfe whom he ſhould happily neuer loue, and for the poſſibilitie of more poſſeſſions, leaſe the fruite and pleaſure of this that he had alredy. For ſmal pleaſure taketh a man in all that euer he hath beſide, if he be wiued againſt his appetite. And I doubt not (quoth he) but there be as yée ſaye other, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> be in euery point comparable with hir. And therfore I let not the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that like them to wedde them. No more is it reaſon, that it miſlike any man, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> I marry where it liketh me. And I am ſure y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> my couſin of <hi>Warwicke</hi> neither loueth me ſo little, to grudge at y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> I loue, nor is ſo vnreaſonable to looke y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I ſhold in choyſe of a wife, rather be ruled by his eie, than by mine own: as though I were a ward y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> wer bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to mary by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of a Gardaine.

That ſhe is a Widow, and hath already children, by Gods bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Ladie, I am a Bacheler &amp; haue ſome to, and ſo eache of vs hath a proofe that nether of vs is like to be barraine. And therefore (Madame) I pray you be contente, I truſt in God ſhe ſhal bring forth a yong Prince that ſhall pleaſe you.

            <p>The Dutches with theſe words nothing appeaſed, and ſéeing the King ſo ſette thereon, that ſhe coulde not pul him back, ſo highly ſhe diſdayned it, that vnder pretext of hir du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to Godwarde, ſhe deuiſed to diſturbe this mariage, and rather to helpe y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> he ſhould marie one Dame <hi>Elizabeth Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> whom the King hadde alſo not long before gotten with childe. Wherfore the Kings mother openly obiected againſt his mariage, as it were in diſcharge of hir conſcience, that

the King was ſure to Dame <hi>Elizabeth Lucy,</hi> and hir huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bande<note place="margin">Elizabeth Lucy</note> before God.

            <p>And albeit that ſhe was by the Kings mother and many other put in good comforte, to affirme that ſhe was enſured vnto the King: yet when ſhe was ſolemnly ſworn to ſay the troth, ſhe confeſſed that they were neuer enſured. Howbeit ſhe ſayde his grace ſpake ſo louing words vnto hir, that ſhe verily hoped he woulde haue maried hir. And y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> if it had not bene for ſuch kinde wordes, ſhe would neuer haue ſhewed ſuch kindnes to him, to let him ſo kindly get hir with child.</p>
            <p>This examination ſolemnly taken, when it was clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<note place="margin">The kings mariage.</note> perceyued that there was none impedimente: the King with gret feaſt and honorable ſolemnitie, maried dame <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth Gray</hi> and hir crowned Quéene that was his enimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es wife, &amp; many time had prayed ful heartilye for his loſſe, in which God loued hir better than to graunte hir hir bone.</p>

in aduoutrie. Of which though ſome by the ignorance of the world and the truth hid from knowledge inherited for the ſeaſon other mens landes, yet God alway ſo prouideth, that it continueth not in their bloud long, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> truth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to light, the rightfull inheritors be reſtored, and the baſtard ſlip pulled vp ere it can be rooted déepe. And when he had laid for the proofe and confirmation of this ſentence certaine enſamples taken out of the old Teſtament, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther auncient hiſtories, then beganne he to deſcend into the praiſe of the Lorde <hi>Richarde</hi> late Duke of <hi>Yorke,</hi> calling him father to the Lorde Protector, and declared the title of his heires vnto the Crowne, to whom it was after the death of King <hi>Henrie</hi> the ſixt entayled by authoritie of Parliament. Then ſhewed he that his verie right heyre of his body law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully begotten was onely the Lord Protector. For he decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red then, that King <hi>Edward</hi> was neuer lawfully marryed vnto the Quéene, but was before God, huſband vnto Dame <hi>Elizabeth Lucie,</hi> and ſo his children baſtardes. And beſides that, neither King <hi>Edwarde</hi> himſelfe, nor the Duke of <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi> among thoſe that were ſecrete in the houſholde, were reckened verie ſurely for the children of the noble Duke, as thoſe that by their fauours more reſembled other knowne men than him. From whoſe vertuous conditions he ſayde alſo that King <hi>Edward</hi> was farre off. But the Lorde Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector he ſayd, the verie noble Prince, the ſpeciall paterne of Knightly prowes, as well in all Princely behauiour as in the lineamentes and fauour of his viſage, repreſented the very face of the noble Duke his father. This is, quoth he, the fathers owne figure, this is his owne countenaunce, the verie print of his viſage, the ſure vndoubted Image, the plaine expreſſe likeneſſe of that noble Duke.</p>
            <p>Nowe was it before deuiſed, that in the ſpeaking of theſe words, the Protector ſhoulde haue come in among the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to the Sermon warde, to the end that thoſe words mée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with his preſence, might haue bene taken among the hearers, as though the holy ghoſt had put them in the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers

But this deuiſe quayled, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the Protectors negligence or the Preachers ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much diligence. For whyle the Protector founde by the way tarying, leaſt he ſhoulde preuent thoſe wordes, and the Doctor fearing that he ſhoulde come ere hys Sermon could come to theſe wordes, haſted his matter thereto, who was come to them, and paſte them, and entred into other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ere the Protector came. Whom when he beheld com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, he ſodainely lefte the matter with which he was in hande, and without any deduction thervnto, out of al order and out of all frame beganne to repeate thoſe wordes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne: this is the very noble Prince, the ſpeciall patrone of Knightly prowes, which as well in all Princely behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, as in the li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

While theſe wordes were in ſpeaking, the Protector accompanied with the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> went through the people in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the place where the Doctors commonly ſtaud in the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſtorie, where he ſtoode to hearken the Sermon. But the people were ſo farre from crying King <hi>Richarde,</hi> that they ſtoode as they had béene turned into ſtones, for wonder of this ſhamefull Sermon.</p>
            <p>After which once ended, the Preacher gat him home, and<note place="margin">Preacher.</note> neuer after durſt looke out for ſhame, but kepte hym out of ſight lyke an Owle. And when he once aſked one that had béene his olde friend what the people talked of him, al were it that hys owne conſcience well ſhewed him that they tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked no good, yet when the other aunſwered him, that there was in euery mannes mouth ſpoken of hym much ſhame, it

ſo ſtrake him to the heart, that within fewe dayes after hée withered and conſumed away.</p>
            <p>Then on the Tueſday folowing this ſermon, there came into the <hi>Guild hall</hi> in <hi>London</hi> the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panyed with diuerſe Lordes and Knightes, more than hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily knewe the meſſage that they brought.

            <p>And by and by ſomewhat louder hée rehearſed them the ſame matter agayne in other order and other wordes ſo well and ornately, and naytheleſſe ſo euidentlye and playne, wyth voyce, geſture, and countenaunce ſo come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ſo conuenient, that euery man muche maruelled that hearde him, and thought that they neuer had in theyr liues heard ſo euil a tale ſo well tolde.</p>
            <p>But were it for wonder or feare, or that eche lookt that other ſhoulde ſpeake firſt: not one worde was there aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered of all the people that ſtoode before, but all was as ſtyll as the mydnight, not ſo muche as rowning amongeſt them, by which they myght ſéeme to commune what was beſt to doe. When the Maior ſawe this, hée with other part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of that Councell drewe aboute the Duke, and ſayde that the people had not béene accuſtomed there to be ſpoken vnto, but by the Recorder, which is the mouth of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and happily to him they wyl aunſwere.

after one, ſtoode as they had béene men amaſed, wherevp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the Duke rowned vnto the Maior and ſayde: this is a maruellous obſtinate ſilence, and there with he turned vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the people agayne with theſe wordes: Deare friendes wée come to mooue you to that thing whiche peraduenture wée not ſo greatlye needed, but that the Lordes of thys Realme, and the commons of other parties might haue ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed: ſauing that wée ſache loue beare you, and ſo much ſet by you, that we woulde not gladlye doe without you, that thing in whiche to be partners is your weale and honour, which as it ſéemeth, either you ſée not, or wey not.

            <p>At theſe wordes the people beganne to whiſper among themſelues ſecretely, that the voice was neither lowde nor diſtinct, but as it were the ſounde of a ſwarme of Bees, tyll at the laſt in the neather end of the Hall, a buſhment of the Dukes ſeruauntes and Naſhfieldes, and other longing to the Protector, with ſome prentiſes and laddes that thruſt into the Hall among the preaſe, beganne ſodainly at mens backes to crye out as loude as theyr throtes woulde gyue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And when the Duke and the Maior ſawe this manner, they wiſelye turned it to theyr purpoſe, and ſayde it was a goodly crye, and a ioyfull to heare, euerye man with one voyce, no man ſaying nay. Wherefore friendes (quoth the Duke) ſince that we perceiue it is all your whole myndes to haue this Noble man for your K. wherof we ſhall make his grace ſo effectuall report, that we doubt not but it ſhall redounde vnto your great we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ale and commodytie: wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire ye that ye to morow go with vs, and we with you vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Noble graced, to make our humble requeſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> vnto him in maner before remembred.

            <p>Then on the morrowe after, the Maior with all the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermen<note place="margin">The Maiors comming to Baynards Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtell.</note> and chiefe commoners of the citie in their beſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner apparelled, aſſembling themſelues together, reſorted vnto <hi>Baynardes Castell</hi> where the Protector lay.

And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vppon the Duke ſent worde vnto the Lorde Protector of the being there of a great and honorable companie; to moue a great matter vnto his grace.</p>
            <p>Wherevpon the Protector made difficultie to come out vnto them, but if he firſt knewe ſome part of their errand, as thoughe he doubted, and partly diſtruſted the comming of a number vnto him ſo ſodenly, without any warning or knowledge whether they came for good or harme. Then the duke when he had ſhewed this vnto the Maior &amp; other, that they might therby ſée how little the Protector looked for this matter, they ſent vnto him by the Meſſenger ſuche louing meſſage againe, and there with ſo humbly beſought him to vouchſafe, that they might reſort to his preſence, to purpoſe their intent, of which they woulde vnto none other perſon part diſcloſe, that at the laſt he came forth of his Chamber, and yet not downe vnto them, but ſtoode aboue in a Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerie ouer them, where they might ſée him, and ſpeake to him, as though be woulde not yet come too néere them tyll he will what they ment.</p>

               </gap>, comming, without his diſpleaſure,
<pb n="820" facs="tcp:18151:418"/>
without which pardon obteined, they durſt not be bolde to moue him of that matter. In whiche albeit they ment as muche honour to his grace, as wealthe to all the Realme beſide, yet were they not ſure howe his grace woulde take it, whom they woulde in no wyſe offende. Then the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector (as he was verie gentle of himſelfe, and alſo longed ſore to witte what they ment) gaue him leaue to purpoſe what him lyked, verily truſting for the good minde that hée bare them all, none of them any thing woulde intende vnto him warde, wherewith he ought to be grieued.</p>
            <p>When the Duke had thys leaue and pardon to ſpeake, then waxed hée bolde to ſhew him their intent and purpoſe, with all the cauſes moouing them therevnto as ye before haue heard, and finally to beſéeche his grace, that it woulde like him of his accuſtomed goodnes &amp; zeale vnto the realme nowe with his eye of pitie, to beholde the long continued diſtreſſe and decaye of the ſame, and to ſet his gracious han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des to redreſſe and amendment thereof, by taking vpon him the Crowne and gouernaunce of thys Realme, accordyng to his ryght and tytle lawfully deſcended vnto him, and to the laude of God, profite of the Lande, and vnto hys grace ſo muche the more honour, and leſſe payne, in that that neuer Prince raygned vppon any people, that were ſo glad to lyue vnder hys obeyſaunce, as the people of thys Realme vnder his.</p>
            <p>When the Protector had hearde the propoſition, he loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked verie ſtraungely therat, &amp; anſwered: that albeit it were y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> he partly knewe the things by them alledged to be true, yet ſuch entire loue he bare vnto King <hi>Ed.</hi> and his children, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ſo much more he regarded his honor in other realmes, about than the Crowne of any one of whiche hée was neuer deſyrous, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> he coulde not finde in his heart in this poynt to enclyne to theyr deſire. For in all other Nations where the truth were not well knowne, it ſhoulde peraduenture be thoughte, that it were his owne ambitious minde and deuiſe, to depoſe the Prince, and take himſelfe the Crowne,
<pb n="821" facs="tcp:18151:418"/>
with which infamie he woulde not haue his honour ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for any Crowne, in which he had euer perceyued much more labour and payne, than pleaſure to hym that would ſo vſe it, as he that woulde not, were not worthie to haue it. Notwithſtanding he not onely pardoned them the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that they made him, but alſo thanked them for the loue and heartie fauour they bare hym, praying them for hys ſake to gyue and beare the ſame to the Prince, vnder whom hée was, and woulde bée content to lyue, and with hys labour and counſell, as farre as ſhould lyke the King to vſe him, he would doe his vttermoſt deuoyre to ſet the Realme in good ſtate, whyche was alreadie in this lyttle whyle of hys Protectorſhippe (the prayſe gyuen to God) well begunne, in that the malice of ſuche as were before occaſion of the contrarie, and of new intended to bée, were nowe partly by good policie, partly more by Gods ſpeciall prouidence, than mans prouiſion repreſſed.</p>
            <p>Uppon this aunſwere giuen, the Duke by the Protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours licence, a lyttle rowned, aſwell wyth other Noble men aboute hym, as with the Maior and Recorder of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi> And after that vppon lyke pardon deſired and obtey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, he ſhewed aloude vnto the Protector, that for a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall concluſion, that the Realme was appoynted King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes</hi> lyne ſhould not any longer raygne vpon them, both for that they hadde ſo farre gone, that it was nowe no ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertie to retreate, as for that they thoughte it for the weale vniuerſall to take that waye, althoughe they had not yet begonne it.</p>
            <p>Wherfore if it would lyke his grace to take the Crowne vppon hym, they woulde humbly beſéeche him therevnto. If he woulde giue them a reſolute aunſwere to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, which they woulde be lothe to heare, then muſt they néedes ſéeke and ſhoulde not fayle to fynde ſome other noble man that would.</p>

enclyned therevnto. But when hée ſawe there was none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther waye, but that eyther he muſt take it, or elſe hée and hys both goe from it, he ſayde vnto the Lordes and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons: Sith wée perceyue well that all the Realme is ſo ſet, whereof wée bée very ſorie that they will not ſuffer in any wiſe King <hi>Edwardes</hi> lyne to gouerne them, whome no man earthly can gouerne agaynſt their wylles, and we wel alſo perceyue, that no man is there, to whome the Crowne can by iuſt tytle appertayne, as to our ſelfe, as verie ryghte heyre lawfully begotten of the bodie of our moſt deare fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Richarde</hi> late Duke of <hi>Yorke,</hi> to whiche tytle is nowe ioyned your election, the Nobles and Commons of thys Realme, which wée of all tytles poſſible take for moſt effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall: Wée bée content and agrée fauourably to enclyne to your petition and requeſt, and accordyng to the ſame, here<note place="margin">The Protector taketh vpon him to be king.</note> wée take vppon vs the royall eſtate, preeminence and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the two noble Realmes, <hi>Englande</hi> and <hi>Fraunce,</hi> the one from this daye forwarde, by vs and our heyres to rule, gouerne, and defende: the other by Gods grace, and your good helpe, to get agayne and ſubdue, and eſtabliſhe for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer in due obedience vnto thys Realme of <hi>Englande,</hi> the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauncement wherof wée neuer aſke of God longer to liue; than we intend to procure.</p>
            <p>With this there was a great ſhoute, crying King <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charde,</hi> King <hi>Richarde.</hi> And then the Lordes went vp to the King (for ſo was he from that tyme called) and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple departed, talking diuerſely of the matter, euery man as hys fantafie gaue him. But much they talked and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelled of the manner of this dealing, that the matter was on both partes made ſo ſtraunge, as thoughe neyther had euer communed with other thereof before, when that them ſelues wyſte there was no manne ſo dull that hearde them, but hée perceyued well ynoughe, that all the matter was made betwéene them. Howbeit ſome excuſed that agayne, and ſayd all muſte be doone in good order? And menne muſt ſomtyme for the manners ſake, not be aknowen what
<pb n="823" facs="tcp:18151:419"/>
they knowe. For at the conſecration of a Byſhop, euerye man woteth well by the paying for his Bulles, that hée purpoſeth to be one, and thoughe he paye for nothing elſe. And yet muſt he be twyce aſked whether he will be Byſhop or no, and he muſte twice ſaye nay, and at the thyrde tyme take it, as compelled therevnto by his owne will. And in a ſtage play, the people know right well, that hée that play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Sowdaine, is percaſe a ſowter, yet if one ſhoulde know ſo little good, to ſhew out of ſeaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> what acquaintance hée hath with hym, and call hym by his owne name while he ſtandeth in his Maieſtie, one of his tormentors myghte hap to breake his head, and worthy for marring of the play.

After whiche time the prince neuer tyed hys pointes, nor aught roughte of himſelfe, but with that yong babe his brother, lingred with thought and heauineſſe, til this trayterous death deliuered them of that wretchedneſſe. For Sir <hi>Iames Tyrell</hi> deuiſed y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> they ſhould be murthered in their beds.

            <p>Then al the other being remoued from them, this <hi>Miles<note place="margin">The yong king and his brother murthered.</note> Forreſt,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Dighton,</hi> about midnight (the ſelie childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> lying in their beddes) came into the Chamber, and ſodain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lapped them vp among the clothes, ſo to bewrapped the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and intangled them, kéeping downe by force the featherbed and pillowes hard vnto their mouths, that within a while, ſmothered and ſtifled, theyr breath fayling, they gaue vp to God their innocente ſoules into the ioyes of Heauen, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the tormentors their bodyes deade in the bed.

Uery troth it is, the Duke was an high minded man, and euill could beare the glorie of an other, ſo that I haue heard of ſome that ſay they ſawe it, that the Duke at ſuch time as the Crowne was firſt ſet vpon the Protectors head, hys eye coulde not abyde the ſight thereof, but wryed his heade an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other waye. But men ſaye, that he was of troth not wel at eaſe, and that both to King <hi>Richarde</hi> well knowen, and not ill taken, nor any demaunde of the Dukes vncurteouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected, but he both with greate giftes and high beheſtes, in moſt louing and truſtie manner, departed at <hi>Glocester.</hi> But ſoone after his comming home to <hi>Brecknocke,</hi> hauing ther in cuſtodie by the commaundement of King <hi>Richarde</hi> Doctor <hi>Morton,</hi> Byſhoppe of <hi>Ely,</hi> who (as yée before hearde) was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the Counſel at the tower, waxed with him familiar: whoſe wiſedome abuſed his pride to his owne deliueraunce and the Dukes deſtruction. The Biſhop was a man of gret natural witte, very wel learned, and honorable in behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, lacking no wiſe wayes to winne fauour. He had bin faſt vpon the part of King <hi>Henrie,</hi> while that parte was in wealth, and naytheleſſe, lefte it not nor forſooke it in woe, but fledde the Realme with the Quéene and the Prince, whyle King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Edwarde</hi> hadde the King in priſon, neuer came home, but to the fielde. After whiche loſte, and that parte vtterly ſubdued, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="834" facs="tcp:18151:424"/>
woed him to come, and hadde him from thenceforth both in ſecreate truſt, and very ſpeciall fauour, whiche he nothing deceiued. For he being (as ye haue hearde) after King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi> death firſte taken by the tyrante, for hys truth to the King, founde the meane to ſet this Duke in his toppe, ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Gentlemen togither in aide of king <hi>Henry,</hi> deuiſing firſt the marriage betwéene him and King <hi>Edwardes</hi> daughter, by which his faith, he declared the good ſeruice to both his maſters at once, with infinit benefite to the realm by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction of thoſe two blouds in one, whoſe ſeueral titles had long enquieted the land, he fled the realme, went to <hi>Rome,</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer minding more to meddle wite the worlde, till the noble Prince King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeauenth gate hym home agayne, made hym Archebyſhoppe of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and Chauncelor of <hi>Englande,</hi> wherevnto the Pope ioined the honor of Cardinal. Thus, lyuing many dayes in as muche honor as one man mighte well wiſhe, ended them ſo godly, that his death with Gods mercie well changed his life.</p>
            <p>This man therefore, as I was aboute to tell you, by the long and often alternate proofe, as well of proſperitie, as ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers fortune, hadde gotten by greate experience the verye mother and miſtreſſe of Wiſedome, a déepe inſighte in polli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique worldly driftes. Whereby, perceyuing nowe thys Duke glad to commune with him, fed him with faire wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, and many pleaſaunt prayſes. And perceyuing by the proceſſe of their communication, the Dukes pride, now and then balke oute a little bredde of enuie, towarde the glorye of the King, and thereby féeling him eaſie to fall oute if the matter were well handled: he craftely ſought the wayes to pricke him forwarde, taking alwayes the occaſion of hys commyng, &amp; ſo kéeping himſelfe ſo cloſe within his bounds, that he rather ſéemed to follow him, then to leade him. For, when the Duke firſte beganne to praiſe and boaſt the king, and ſhewe howe muche profite the Realme ſhoulde take by his raigne: my Lorde <hi>Morton</hi> anſwered: Surely my Lord, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

your Lordſhip would not I wéene beléeue, but that if y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> world would haue gone as I wold haue wiſhed, K. <hi>Henries</hi> ſon had had the Crown, &amp; not King <hi>Ed.</hi> But after that God hadde ordered him to looſe it, and King <hi>Edwarde</hi> to raigne, I was neuer ſo madde that I woulde with a deade manne ſtriue againſt the quicke. So was I to King <hi>Edward</hi> a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Chaplaine, and glad woulde haue bin that his chylde hadde ſuccéeded him. Howbeit, if the ſecrete iudgemente of God haue otherwiſe prouided, I purpoſe not to ſpurre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a pricke, nor laboure to ſette vppe that God pulleth downe.

hence, bicauſe of thys proclamation made of horned beaſts. What foole quoth the Foxe, thou mayſt abyde wel ynough, the Lion meant not by thée, for it is none horne that is in thine heade. No marry (quoth hée) that wote I wel ynough. But what and he call it an horne, where am I then? The Duke laughed merily at the tale, and ſaid, My L.

And yet taken as I wéene it woulde, might happen to turne me to little good, and you to leſſer. Then longed the Duke yet muche more to witte what it was, wherevpon the Biſhoppe ſaide, in good faith my Lord, as for the late Protector, ſith he is now King in poſſeſſion, I purpoſe not to diſpute his title, but for the weale of this Realme, whereof his grace hath now the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernaunce, and wherof I am my ſelfe one poore member, I was about to wiſhe, that to thoſe good abilities whereof he hath alredy righte many, little néeding my prayſe: it might yet haue pleaſed God, for the better ſtore, to haue giuen him ſome of ſuch other excellente vertues, méete for the rule of a realme, as our Lord hath planted in the perſon of your grace: and there left againe.</p>

The Embaſſador when he ſaw tyme, repaired before the King and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayle, where he declared the effect of all his affaires ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly, with ſuch grauitie and eloquence, that all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell that heard him, commended him, eſtéeming his expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to be almoſt beyond the capacitie of man.

<pb n="909" facs="tcp:18151:457"/>
which delighted him much: and thus the Almoner ruled all them that were before him, ſuch did hys policie and witte bring to paſſe. Who was now in hygh fauoure but Maiſter Almoner? and who ruled all vnder the King, but Maiſter Almouer? thus he perſeuered in fauour, vntill at laſt in came preſents, giftes, and rewards ſo plentifully, that he lacked nothing that might eyther pleaſe his fanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, or enrich his coffers. And thus procéeding in fortunes bliſfulneſſe, it chanced the warres betwéene the Realmes of <hi>Englande</hi> and <hi>France</hi> to be open, in ſo much, as the King béeing fully perſwaded in hys moſt royall perſon to inuade hys foraigne enimies with a puiſſant Armye, wherefore it was neceſſarye that thys royall enterpriſe ſhoulde bée ſpéedily prouided and furniſhed in euery degrée of things apt and conueniente for the ſame, the expedition where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the King thought no mans witte ſo méete for policie and paynefull trauayle, as was hys Almoner, to whome therefore he committed hys whole truſt therein, and hée tooke vpon hym the whole charge of all the buſineſſe, and brought all things to good paſſe in a decent order, as all manner of victualles, prouiſions, and other neceſſaryes conueniente for ſo noble a voyage and Armie.</p>
            <p>All things béeyng by hym perfected, the King aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to hys royall enterpriſe, paſſed the Seas, and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched forwarde in good order of battayle, vntill hée came to the ſtrong Towne of <hi>Turwyne,</hi> to the whyche hée layde hys ſéege, and aſſayled it very ſtrongly continually with ſuch vehemente aſſaultes, that within ſhort ſpace it was yéelded vnto hys Maieſtie, vnto the which place, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Maximilian</hi> repaired vnto the King with a greate Armie like a mightie Prince, taking of the King his Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces wages, which is a rare thing, and but ſeldome ſéene, an Emperour to fighte vnder a Kings Banner.</p>
            <p>Thus after the King, had obteyned this puiſſant Fort, and taken the poſſeſſion thereof, and ſette all thynges there in due order, for the defence and preſeruation

cauſes touchyng the Kings Maieſtie, it was thought, that ſo noble a Prince (the Cardinall) was moſte méete to be ſente: wherefore, being readye to take vppon hym the charge thereof, was furniſhed in all degrées and purpoſes, moſte lyke a greate Prince: for firſte he procéeded forth fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed lyke a Cardinall: hys Gentlemen béeyng verye ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in number, were clothed in Lyuerie coates of Crimoſin Ueluet of the beſt, wyth chaines of Golde aboute theyr nec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, and hys yeomen and meane officers, in coates of fine Scarlet, garded with blacke Ueluet a hande broade.</p>
            <p>Thus furniſhed, he was twice ſente into <hi>Flaunders</hi> to the Emperour then lying in <hi>Bruges,</hi> whom he did moſt highly, entertain diſcharging al his charges &amp; his me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. There was no houſe within the town of <hi>Bruges,</hi> wherein any Gentlema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Cardinals were lodged, or had recourſe, but that the owners were commaunded by the Emperoures officers, that they, vpon paine of their liues, ſhoulde take no mony for anye thing that the Cardinalles ſeruantes diode take of anye kinde of victuall, no althoughe they were diſpoſed to make anye coſtlye banquets: commaunding forthermore their ſaide hoſtes, to ſée y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> they lacked no ſuch things as they honeſtly required for their honeſty &amp; pleaſure. Alſo the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors officers euery night we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t through the town fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> houſe to houſe, whereas any Engliſh Gentleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> did repaſt or lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, &amp; ſerued their liueries for all night, which was done in this maner. Firſt, the Officers brought into the houſe a caſt of fine Manchet, &amp; of ſiluer two great pots with white wine, and Sugar to the waighte of a pounde: white lights and yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe lightes of Ware: a boule of ſiluer wyth a Goblet to drinke in, and euerye night a ſtaffe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> torche: This was the order of the liueries euerye nighte: and in the morning, when the ſame officers came to fetch away their ſtuffe, then woulde they accompte with the hoſtes for the Gentlemens coſtes ſpent in the daye before.</p>
            <p>Thus the Emperoure entertayned the Cardinall and all his traine for the time of his Embaſſage there.

And that done, he returned into <hi>Englande</hi> with great tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphe.</p>

            <p>Thus peruſing all the Ladyes and Gentlewomen, to ſome they loſte, and of ſome they wonne: and peruſing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this maner al the Ladies, they returned to the Cardinal with greate reuerence, powring downe all their Golde ſo lefte in their Cup, whych was aboue twoo hundred crowns: At all (quoth the Cardinall) and ſo caſte the Dice and wan them, whereat was made a great noiſe and ioy.

After long debating, the Commons granted two ſhillings of the pound of euery mans goodes and lands that were worth twentie pound, or might diſpend twentie pound by yeare, and ſo vpward, and from fortie ſhillings to twentie pound, twelue pence of the pound, and vnder fortie ſhillings of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery head ſixtéene yeares and vpward four pence to be paid in two yeares.

            <p>It chanced in the yeare paſſed, a grudge to breake out betwéene the French King, and the Duke of <hi>Burbon,</hi> in ſo much, that the Duke for the ſafegard of his life, fledde out of the French Kings Dominions, whereof the Cardinall <hi>Wolſey</hi> hauing intelligence, compriſed in his head, that if the King our ſoueraigne Lord could obteyne him to be his Generall in the warre againſt the French King, and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering further that the Duke of <hi>Burbon</hi> was fledde vnto the Emperour to inuite him to a like purpoſe, wherefore he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing this imagination in his head, thought it good to moue<note place="margin">A policie of Cardinall VVolſey, that in the end tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againſt himſelfe.</note> the King in the matter, and after the King was once ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſed héereof, and conceyuing the Cardinals inuention, at laſt it came to a conſultation among the Counſell; ſo that it was concluded that an Embaſſade ſhould be ſente to the Emperour about the matter, with whome he was, that the King and the Emperour ſhould ioyne in thoſe warres a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the French King, and that the Duke of <hi>Burbon</hi> ſhould<note place="margin">The Duke of Burbon Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion for the K. of England a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the King of France.</note> be our Kings Champion and Generall in the fielde, who had a great number of good Souldiours, ouer and beſides the Emperours armie, which was not ſmall: and that the King ſhould pay vnto the Duke monethly wages, both for himſelfe, and his retinue, in ſo much, as Sir <hi>Iohn Ruſſell</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sir Iohn Ruſſel.</note> lay continually beyond the Seas in a ſecret place, both to receyue money of the King, and to pay the ſame monethly to the Duke, ſo that the Duke began the warres with the French King in his owne territorie and Dukedome, which the King had confiſked in his owne hands, being not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly knowne vnto the Dukes enimies that he had any ayde out of <hi>England,</hi> and thus he wrought the French King much diſpleaſure, in ſo much, as the French King was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreyned<note place="margin">1525</note> to prepare a puiſſant Armie, and in his owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to reſiſt the Dukes power, and with force the King droue him to take <hi>Pauy,</hi> a ſtrong Towne in <hi>Italy,</hi> with hys hoſt, for their ſecuritie, whereas the King encamped hym
