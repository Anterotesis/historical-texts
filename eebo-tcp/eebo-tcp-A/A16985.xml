            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Reader Grace and Peace.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving in my cuſtodie (Chriſtian
Reader) a coppie of <hi>M. Broughtons
Sermon on the Lords Prayer:</hi> I
found it upon peruſall, to conteine the
<hi>Summe</hi> of all <hi>Divinitie:</hi> eſpecially
being ſo fitly compared with the <hi>Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue,</hi>
which maketh the ſence more
heauenly, and the harmonie more ſweet:
and being compoſed together with much plainenes and bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitie,
and alſo garnished with much learning from the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<hi>Rabbins,</hi> which the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> alloweth: which
when I had wel conſidered, I began to reaſon with my ſelf,
why ſo worthy a worke should be hidde from the world, and
not rather be communicated to all, for the common good of
all: eſpecially conſidering that it was his continuall deſire, &amp;
conſtant endeavour (not to hide his learning, but) to ſpende
him ſelf, and his whole estate, in the ſervice of Christ, by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing
the Goſpell, and expounding the Holy Schriptures,
both the <hi>Hiſtorie</hi> of them, and alſo the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of
them.</p>
            <p>And firſt, for the <hi>Hiſtorie of the Scriptures,</hi> he compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
it, in a moſt plaine and profitable manner, into one ſhort
viewe, which he called <hi>A Conſent of Scripture:</hi> and herein
<pb facs="tcp:15218:3"/>
he did carefully explaine three neceſſarie <hi>Circumſtances,</hi>
that is to ſay, <hi>Tyme, Place</hi> and <hi>Perſon:</hi> without the
knowledge of which <hi>Circumſtances,</hi> the <hi>Hiſtorie</hi> of the
<hi>Bible</hi> can never rightly be underſtood: and therefore with
great paynes, and no leſſe learning, he made many ſeverall
<hi>Treatiſes,</hi> upon theſe three <hi>Circumſtances;</hi> firſt, <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi>
the truth of them by <hi>Scripture:</hi> and <hi>ſecondly,</hi> in
<hi>defending</hi> of that <hi>Truth,</hi> against the manifold <hi>Errors</hi> of
former <hi>Writers:</hi> and alſo againſt the manifold cavilations
of ſundry late <hi>Oppoſers.</hi> And therefore all thoſe that
upbraide his learned paynes with the terme of <hi>needleſſe Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nealogies,</hi>
and <hi>unprofitable Chronologie,</hi> they are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
to beare the burden of their owne ignorance: for how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever,
they thinke in their owne conceite, they know much,
yet in deede &amp; in truth they might know more, to their grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
joy and comfort, if they did not deſpiſe the <hi>Holy Rules,</hi>
(I meane the afore-named <hi>Circumſtances</hi>) wherewith <hi>God
hath garniſhed his bleſſed Word,</hi> as a ſpeciall help to guide
everie wiſe hearted Reader in the true underſtanding of the
ſame.</p>
            <p>And ſecondly, this <hi>Learned Divine</hi> of bleſſed memorie,
hath alſo declared his ſpeciall loue to the <hi>Church of God,</hi>
in adding much help, for the better understanding of the
<hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Bible:</hi> although his manner was not to
make large <hi>Common-place bookes:</hi> becauſe the moſt
Writers doe imploy their paynes about it: therefore he
thought it more neceſſarie to imploy himſelfe, in giving
<hi>Rules</hi> for the true underſtanding of the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and for
the right expounding of ſome <hi>Common places,</hi> wherein
many Writers doe not agree, becauſe the ſcope of the <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures</hi>
is not rightly underſtood: and therefore he hath
giuen us warning, how to underſtand many <hi>Common pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:</hi>
as about <hi>Predeſtination,</hi> &amp; <hi>the Sufferings of Chriſt:</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:15218:3"/>
and about the <hi>Article,</hi> commonly called <hi>Chriſtes Diſcent
into Hel:</hi> &amp;c. Alſo he ſpeaketh much, and to great light,
upon the myſterie of the <hi>Holy Trinitie,</hi> and of the <hi>Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
and <hi>Reſurrection of Chriſt:</hi> as alſo of the <hi>Fall of
Man,</hi> and of the great myſterie of our <hi>Redemption:</hi> and
of many other weighty poynts: as appeareth in this inſuing
<hi>Treatiſe:</hi> and in many other of his <hi>Works:</hi> as in <hi>Iob,
Eccleſiaſtes, Daniel, and his large Commentarie on the
Appocalypſis:</hi> &amp;c. Now if this be true, as it is moſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
in the aforenamed books, then it ſhould ſtop the mouthes
of all thoſe, that ſlander his learned paynes, becauſe ſay they,
he teacheth no <hi>Sanctification:</hi> but they doe litle conſider,
when they ſay ſo, that the <hi>Ground of Sanctification</hi> conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth
in the <hi>Holy and right knowledge of the Word of
God,</hi> which muſt firſt be ſeated in the <hi>minde &amp; conſcience,</hi>
before it can be practiſed in the life and converſation.</p>
            <p>O but, ſay ſome, his writings are not worth the reading,
becauſe they are ſo difficult &amp; hard to understand: I anſwer
with S. Peter, that many things are hard to be understood in
<hi>Pauls Epiſtles, 2 Pet.</hi> 3, 16. ſhall we therfore not count them
worth the reading, becauſe they are ſomewhat difficult? no,
no, God requires the paines of the mind for the understa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding
of his word, for it is a treaſure hid in the ground, &amp; therfore
they muſt take paynes to digge for it, that will haue it: ſo if
men could but endure the paynes of the minde, they would
ſpeake more reverendly of this mans Writings: but becauſe
men loue ſuch eaſe, they cannot ſee the drift of his Writing:
and therefore well may his great Learning lamente, becauſe
ſo fewe regarde it: for it is almost ſollitarie and unknowne
to his owne <hi>Nation,</hi> becauſe fewe doe knowe, what his lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
paynes may further, which is more precious then
<hi>Rubies:</hi> Yea, therefore, his knowledge doth powre
teares downe her cheekes, becauſe ſhee is understood of
<pb facs="tcp:15218:4"/>
none. But I would to God, that ſome <hi>Learned man</hi> would
take the paynes to contriue al his <hi>Workes</hi> in to one <hi>Volume,</hi>
that ſo his great learning might not periſh in <hi>Oblivion:</hi>
but that the ages to come may haue it in <hi>Record</hi> for their
help and furtherance in <hi>Divinitie ſtudies,</hi> who wil doubtles
reape more fruit by them, then we doe, by reaſon of our vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfulnes,
and ſo the God of all peace be with thee Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Reader; and the Lord giue thee understanding in all
things. Amen.</p>

then to miſſe of this: for the price is Gehenna.</p>
               <p>While the families, that hoped in Chriſt were few: that
one Biſhop might teach them, the Law was not written:
Sem, <hi>Arphaxad, Selah, Heber, Abraham,</hi> and his ſonnes by
<hi>Returah,</hi> (whence Iob was) Iſaac, Iacob, Ioſeph, taught
theirs the redemtion by word of mouth, &amp; equitie by the
Law of nature. But when Iſrael multiplied, a few ſuffiſed
not to be Biſhops, then a Law was written: and all Iſrael
fortie yeeres had leaſure to learne it. And Levites were the
common Biſhops in the land: as Biſhop <hi>Eleazar,</hi> ſpeciall
one. PAKID, a man of charge, is <hi>Epiſcopus</hi> in the LXX. &amp;
<hi>1 Timoth.</hi> 3. But not Levites onely were learned. Al <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roches</hi>
through the twelue Tribes had their Doctors of
their owne: and all of Iſrael often, and no Levite: as ſome
were only of Levites in their 48 townes lotted to Levi:
and the <hi>high Councill</hi> might be all of Iſrael, or all of Levi, as
it ſhould fal out. The Synagogues or <hi>Paroches</hi> had nothing
to doe with ſacrifice: nor had any ceremonie of Levi: no
cope of Linnen, as Aaron, neither linnen: only one ſhirt, a
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:15218:11"/>
Girdle, and a Cappe, as <hi>Levites</hi> in the Temple. Neyther
might they any more imitate <hi>Aharons</hi> attire, then they
might ſacrifice there.</p>
               <p>In their Synagogues they read the Law, and all ſaving
hand-laborers, thrice a weeke from Childhood frequented
Divinitie-ſcholes. Of them the chief were choſen to rule,
and to teach after <hi>Angelus Eccleſiae</hi> had read: or they might

ſpeake: or, after often approbation they might offer their
payns. And this Policie, <hi>Luc. 4. and 1 Corin.</hi> 14. alloweth.
So reaſon bred this policie: and the holy Nation practiſed
the ſame 1400 yeres; knowing it a hard point to ſanctifie

both ſides held the ſame minde for the old Teſtament: and

               <p>Both equally held that the Veſtments of the Temple

where the much diminiſhed, and the litle ſufficed. And
all Iudahs pollicie required the ſame: that the rich ſhould
help the poor: ſo that riches could not be great. And the
Heathen <hi>Porphyri,</hi> cited by <hi>Euſcbius</hi> teacheth that of the
Iewes pollicie, the content of riches was practiſed in the

               <p>And men of State are equally limited by Law: the King

godly: and when we marke whence it commeth, a world
of knowledge commeth with it. But firſt we haue a great
Combat for the poſſeſſion of it. The Pope his Latin Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation
hath it not: he diſputeth that it ſhould be a trifling
addition by <hi>Gregory Martyn:</hi> &amp; his Arabique Tranſlation
printed at Rome hath it not and our Communion book
(for which our Right Reverend Fathers too much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend)
hath it not. And one Greeke Coppie in the French
Librarie, cited R. Ste. had it not: what ſhall we then
ſay to it, if it be no part of the Bible, it is wicked to ſay,
our Lord ſpake it: and by our BB. ſubſcription it is evident
that we haue not a new Teſtament. The ſewes ſay for the
Teſtament in Ieruſal. Saned. <hi>A Teſtament that fayleth in
part, fayleth in all.</hi> Wherefore our Biſhops muſt herein
leaue the Pope: and he muſt looth himſelf.</p>
               <p>And thus ſtandeth the Caſe: ſtrong by coppies, and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:15218:15"/>
ſtronger by matter: firſt, of ſixteen Coppies in the French
Librarie, cited by <hi>Ro. Stephen</hi> fifteene had this clauſe: and
reaſon might tell, ſome trifler left it out, eyther by the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine:
or by not knowing why S. Luke left it out: But all
of judgement know, that abridgers in Scripture be ſhort.
And S. Luke in the bleſſings hath but fiue of the whole.
And from the firſt Narrator, matters are to be had: as euen
the Pope ſtandeth to his Latine for S. Matthew.</p>
               <p>Beſides, the Arabique written Tranſlations, one which
I haue, brought lately from the Eaſt: an other which the
worthy renowmed <hi>Arias Montanus</hi> lent the learned
Printer Raphelingius, theſe haue the ſaying: <hi>Thyne is the
Kingdome, the powre, and glorie, for ever and ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And here commeth the Pope to judgment, how his
<hi>Arabique</hi> Coppie ſhould not agree with the Greeke: ſeing
other Coppies doe: if Coppies common haue that ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
how ſhould his miſſe it. The Arabique notation is
plaine, and voyde of ſchooltricks: and ſeing their Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlations
that are abroad haue this clauſe, reaſon telleth that
the Greeke Originals, that went over <hi>Arabia</hi> had it: as all
the uſuall in the Weſt. Beſides the Chaldi Ethiopian
printed at <hi>Rome</hi> hath this: and the nation was large, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
over Eaſt &amp; South. So millions of Originall Greek
Coppies in thoſe quarters are ſuppoſed to haue the ſame.
Alſo the Siriaque Tranſlation hath, <hi>Thine is the Kingdome,
the Powre and Glorie, for ever and ever:</hi> ſo millions then
held it part of the New Teſtament: and hold the Pope a
Corrupter. And <hi>Theophilact</hi> in Greeke printed at Rome
1542, hath the ſentence. So by number of voyces it
ſtandeth as Gods word.</p>
               <p>And better by matter; for when the four fierce beaſts,
Daniel 7. had taken away the holy Iewes Kingdome,
<hi>One like a SONNE OF MAN commeth in the clouds of heauen:
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:15218:15"/>
and goeth againe to the everlasting in dayes: and to him is

that we haue a pure New Teſtament: for everie word in

come out of the Seas, and periſhed before our Lord his

moſt glorious: but to bare prayer, as the Apoſtles re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired

diſcourſe,<note place="margin">Marc. 10. Act. 1.</note> for men that looked for glorie on the earth:
and ſo S. Luke omitted it: becauſe it was ynough to be
ſpoken once: if we had followed now the one, and now
the other, we had honoured both: But now we joyne
with the Popes Latine Tranſlation of mans wit and ſlight
mayming of the Bible, and that which hath no authoritie
againſt the holy Greeke Original, which hath the powre
of him,<note place="margin">Iob 26.</note> that framed all the World, and bewtified the

Gods throne, to abide a judgment unto eternal paynes: &amp;
be tormented before God and Lam for ever and ever.</p>
               <p>All ſouls of men aſcend: and none ever deſcended: but
as death his inferior to life, it is termed a deſcent: and the

               <p>That which Chriſtians call, the world to come, is called
of the Iews in their common writings, the world of ſouls:
and of the Grecians of all ages, Hades: And the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
hield it a moſt happie thing, for a juſt man to goe
from this World to Hades.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtles Articles of belief was written in Greeke,
&amp; according to the Greek it muſt be expounded. There is
<hi>Hades, the World of ſouls:</hi> where be diſtinct places of joy,
(for our Lord, and Abraham, &amp; Lazarus, and all the holy)
called Heauen: and of ſorrow, called Hell. The ſouls of the
one place, know the caſe of the other. And when we ſpeak
of the juſt, that he is gone to Hades, we meane, that he is
gone hence unto the joyes of God. And ſo would all Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians

               <p>When men ſpeak of a horſe loſing life: they would ſay,
He is dead: when of a man, that hath an immortall ſoule,
He is dead and gone to Hades: the one for the bodie, the

               <p>And Heathen had no greater ground of incouragement
to dye for their Counttey, then the hope of good in

Hades. And hence we muſt note that our Lord twice
aſcended: once in ſoul onely from the Croſſe: the other
tyme in bodie and ſoul into the ayre, and unto the place
of joy, where all glorie ſhineth.</p>
               <p>The Engliſh, <hi>He deſcended into Hel;</hi> is as cleane contrary
to the Greek, which is our ground herein, as black is to
white: and as we take Hell, therein we deny our Lord to
be the holy one of God, and our foregoer into joy: for he
hath ſayd, that none ſhall paſſe from the damned, to Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.
And if we be found to haue contrarie rules of fayth,
God will judge us wicked, for profeſſing as Trueth matter
diſagreable.</p>
               <p>The mainteyners of the tranſlation, <hi>He deſcended to Hell,</hi>
ſhould be forced to revoke that, and the high ſcholars to
tranſlate it aright. And as holy Matrons, many of old
