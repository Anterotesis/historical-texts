         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

upon you to beware and repent; ſome preach more,
at leaſt more practically, when they are dead, then
ever they did whilſt they were alive. You that
were his <hi>Patrons</hi> and <hi>Encouragers,</hi> as hee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
ever,<note place="margin">Dr. Bayly, Dr. Prideaux, Dr. Fell.</note> when he was in the heigth of his Rebellion, doe
you <hi>beware leſt a worſe thing come unto you.</hi> You that were
the <hi>Licenſers</hi> of his ſubtile Atheiſme, Repent, Repent; for he
<pb facs="tcp:111525:3"/>
was ſo hardened by your flattery, that (for ought the moſt
charitable man can judge) hee periſhed by your Approbation:
he ever appealed to his works even to his very dying day, and
what was it, which made him dote upon them, but your Licence
and Approbation? Heark what hee ſaith, <hi>The third and laſt
part of my Accuſation was, That I anſwer out of principles,
which Proteſtants themſelves will profeſſe to deteſt:</hi> which
indeed were to the purpoſe, if it could be juſtified. But beſides
<hi>that, it is confuted by my whole Book, and made ridiculous
by the Approbation premiſed unto it, &amp;c.</hi> read Mr <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingworth</hi>
his Preface to the Author of Charity &amp;c. Sect. 30.
Sure I am, that the Accuſation may bee juſtified, and therefore
is to the purpoſe; but the Approbation cannot bee juſtified, and
is therefore juſtly Reprobated: The Accuſation is ſo ſerious,
that the Approbation cannot make it (but may well make the
Approvers and their Church) ridiculous. O what a ridiculous
Church doe the Licenſers make the Church of <hi>England</hi> to be,
by ſaying that there is nothing in Mr <hi>Chillingworth</hi> his Book
contrary to the doctrine of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> ſure they
meant the Church of <hi>Canterbury.</hi> But Dr <hi>Fell,</hi> and Dr
<hi>Bayly</hi> are not aſhamed to ſay, that there is nothing in that Book
contrary to good manners, which Dr <hi>Prideaux</hi> would not ſay; but
enough of that.</p>
            <p>Sirs, the following Hiſtory will teſtifie my compaſſion towards
your deceaſed friend, whom I ever <hi>oppoſed in a charitable and

the carkaſſe of <hi>Hector,</hi> or to pluck a dead Lion by the beard;
ſhould I miſquote his Book, and make that errour mine owne
by a falſe citation, which I pretend to be his in an Accuſation,
you that were the unhappy Licencers of his Book would ſoone take
me tripping. If you conceive that he deſerved a more Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
buriall, bee pleaſed to anſwer my Reaſons, and patronize
his errours with all the learning <hi>Bodleyes Library can afford:</hi>
or elſe ſtudy <hi>his Catechiſme,</hi> pardon my boldneſſe, ſome Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers

or elſe this man we speak of had never beene ſo
much admired, his Book extolled, or theſe Antichriſtian warres
<pb facs="tcp:111525:3"/>
fomented by ſuch great Clerks and buſie wits.</p>
            <p>I looked upon Mr <hi>Chillingworth</hi> as one who had his head as
full of Scruples as it was of Engines, and therefore dealt as ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
with him as I uſe to doe with men of the moſt nice and
tender conſciences: for I conſidered, that though Beefe muſt bee
preſerved with ſalt; yet Plums muſt be preſerved with ſugar.
I can aſſure you I ſtooped as low to him as I could without fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
and you know he is not a wiſe man in the judgement of
the Philoſopher, who ſtoops ſo low to another mans weakneſſe,
that he himſelfe falls into weakneſſe: and it is a Rule with us
at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> that <hi>he falls into weakneſſe who falls into
ſinne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Doe not conceive that I ſnacht up my pen in an angry mood,
that I might vent my dangerous wit, and eaſe my overburthened
ſpleene. No, no, I have almoſt forgot <hi>the Viſitation at Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
Colledge, the Deniall of my Grace, the plundering of
my houſe and little Library:</hi> I know when and where and of
whom to demand ſatisfaction for all theſe injuries and indignities.
I have learnt <hi>Centum plagas Spartanâ Nobilitate conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quere.</hi>
I have not yet learnt how to plunder others of goods
or living, and make my ſelfe amends by force of armes. I will
not take a living which belonged to any civill, ſtudious, learned
Delinquent, unleſſe it be the much neglected <hi>Commendam</hi> of
ſome Lordly Prelate condemned by the knowne Lawes of the
Land, and the higheſt Court of the Kingdome for ſome offence
of the first magnitude: I can, without ſtraining my conſcience,
ſwallow ſuch a gnat, a camel I ſhould ſay, for every one of their
<hi>Commendams</hi> hath a bunch upon its back, and may well make
a bunch upon their conſcience. I ſhall not trouble you with any
long diſcourſe about State matters, only you will give me leave

               <pb facs="tcp:111525:4"/>
and ſome conceive that you hold correspondence with all the <hi>ſwore
Planets,</hi> and that you have enticed the truſty <hi>Sunne</hi> from his
Ecliptick line, and taught him to goe Retrograde. We wonder,
<hi>I</hi> muſt tell you, that the Sunne never came into <hi>Libra,</hi> that Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
Proteſtations, Actions were ſeldome or never <hi>weighed</hi> in

<hi>Venus (I</hi> had almost forgot my Aſtronomy, and ſaid <hi>Iuno)</hi> was
ſhufled into <hi>Virgo's</hi> place, and the ſigne was in the <hi>Dogs head,</hi>
when we did expect it in a more propitious place, the <hi>Lions heart.
I</hi> remember that of <hi>Tertullian, Habet &amp; Eccleſia dies Cani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culares,</hi>
the Church of Chriſt hath cauſe to complaine of <hi>Dog
dayes;</hi> for the Dog doth not only ſhew his teeth; we heare him
bark and feele him bite; we may in every month write the Dog
dayes in capitall letters, nay you write them for us (ſo capitall
are your crimes) in letters of blood. What is <hi>England</hi> become
a Wilderneſſe? if it be not, why are ſo many wilde beaſts ſuffered

chaine up thoſe beaſts before the firſt of <hi>March:</hi> if ſhame work

               </gap>,
ſtrike if you pleaſe; yet heare me, or at leaſt heare what
the Prophet ſaith to me, doth he not ſpeak of you? <hi>Then hee
ſaid unto me,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ezek. 8. 17. 18.</note> 
               <hi>Haſt thou ſeene this O ſonne of man. Is it
a light thing to the houſe of Iudah, that they commit the
abominations which they commit here? for they have fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the Land with violence, and have returned to provoke
me to anger: and lo they put their branch to their noſe.
Therefore</hi>—read and tremble at the reſt. Come, come
<pb facs="tcp:111525:4"/>
away with this learned Atheiſme, your Iudge looks upon you,
the ſearcher of hearts and diſcoverer of ſecrets is acquainted
with all your plots. The Lord ſees what the Ancients of
<hi>Oxford</hi> doe in the dark, every man in the chambers of his
imagery: the Lord heares what you ſay—O doe not ſay
as the Ancients of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſaid, <hi>The Lord ſeeth us not, the
Lord hath forſaken the earth. I</hi> am afraid that you have the
ſame temptations at <hi>Oxford,</hi> which were preſented to <hi>Origen,</hi> an
<hi>Ethiopian woman, and an Idoll;</hi> he was (you know) put to this
unhappy choice, to commit folly with which he pleaſed. Some luſt
as mnch after idols, as others doe after women; if in theſe dayes of
liberty you reſtraine from neither, you doe in effect tempt to both,
and are the grand ſeducers of the hopefull Gentry: but alaſſe you
are guilty of a more ambitious wickedneſſe, it is your ſtudy to ſeduce
a King.</p>
            <p>I remember an old ſtory of King <hi>Canutus,</hi> who (as the Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicler
relates) took off the Crowne from his owne head, and ſet it
upon the Crucifixe at <hi>Weſtminſter:</hi> But tell me (you that have
read ſome Italian Jeſuite more ſubtile then the Politicians <hi>Saint,</hi>
Saint <hi>Machiavel)</hi> doe you conceive that you can perſwade our

            <p>I have examined your great Champion Doctor <hi>Ferne</hi> his
three bookes, and cannot finde any thing in them, whereby the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
of an impartiall Scholar may be fully reſolved or ſatisfied.
It is very impertinent, in my weake judgement, to talke of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges
of the Kings of <hi>Judah,</hi> who were immediately elected by
God; or to diſcourſe of the power of the Romane Emperour, or the
first draughts of Government in the <hi>Saxon</hi> and <hi>Norman</hi> lines;
for Doctor <hi>Ferne</hi> doth acknowledge <hi>that it is not injurious to his
Majeſties poſterity,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Dr Ferne his 2. book p. 33.</note> 
               <hi>that the King ſweares to a limited power,

Doctor <hi>Ferne</hi> diſtinguiſhes betweene the <hi>Title</hi> of the King, and the
<hi>Power</hi> of the King; but wee did never ſo much as once queſtion
his Majeſties Title, whether it be limited or no? It is confeſſed
that his power, and therefore much more the exerciſe of his power,
is limited by the Priviledges of the Parliament, the immunities
of the Subject, and the Kings owne oath: Nay, it is acknowledged
that the two houſes of Parliament are in a ſort <hi>co-ordinate with
his Majeſty,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Dr Ferns 2. book p. 6.</note>

ſo much granted, that the reſt need not be diſputed. But
what if theſe powers be divided, and claſh one againſt the other?
why then the power is not fully in King or Parliament, for the
power which is in the three Estates is ſuspended, whileſt one part
<pb facs="tcp:111525:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſuſpends:<note place="margin">Book 2 p. 34.</note> So Doctor <hi>Ferne.</hi> Give me leave to aske him, and you,
whether the power of the <hi>Militia</hi> be not in the three Eſtates, as
well as the power of making Lawes? if it be not, then ſure the power
of making Lawes is to no purpoſe, becauſe they have no power to
defend or enforce I aw: and if the power of the <hi>Militia</hi> be in the
three Eſtates, then the Kings power of levying, arming men, &amp;c.
is ſuſpended by the ſeverall Ordinances of Parliament; for it is
Doctor <hi>Fernes</hi> concluſion, that the power which is in the three
Eſtates is ſuſpended whileſt one part ſuspends; <hi>Ergo,</hi> much more
if two Eſtates ſuspend.</p>
            <p>But on the other ſide, <hi>I</hi> deſire Doctor <hi>Ferne</hi> to ſhew how the
Kingdome is ſecured by the government of three Eſtates, if the
two houſes of Parliament have not ſufficient power to preſerve the
King and the Kingdome, in caſe the King refuſe to preſerve it or
him.<note place="margin">Book 2. p 28.</note> 
               <hi>It is unreaſonable</hi> (ſaith Doctor <hi>Ferne) that the ſupply

<hi>Doctor,</hi> it is unreaſonable for the Head to neglect the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
of it ſelfe, and the body; but it is very reaſonable for to

therefore reaſonable for both houſes to take up armes, and lift up
their armes, put forth their whole ſtrength to defend the King and

which hath provided this <hi>temper of three Eſtates, as the reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable

enter into my dull pate to conceive, that our Government is of any
ſetled temper; or that we have any reaſonable meanes provided
for the ſafety of this Kingdome, by that fundamentall conſtitution,
if the King may doe what he pleaſes, ſeize on our goods, ('tis Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor

but the conſciences of our poſterity; and there is no more
power in both houſes of Parliament to protect us by force against
force, then if we had no ſuch remedy provided, as the government
of three Eſtates. Are we not ſubjected to an abſolute Monarch,
if the other two Eſtates have no legall power to releeve our negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
or oppreſſed Common-wealth? how are we <hi>ſecured</hi> by the

temper of three Eſtates? or how can it be called a <hi>temper?</hi> or a
temper of <hi>three</hi> Eſtates? if the firſt of the three may oppreſſe us,
and the other two have no power to releeve us? Sure <hi>I</hi> am, that
by this account there is but one Eſtate that hath a true power, and
therfore that Estate muſt be an eſtate of abſolute Monarchy, which
Dr <hi>Ferne</hi> himſelfe ſeemes to abhorre; and yet ſo vaine is that
Doctor, as to call the Power of Supply legally placed in both
Houſes of Parliament, a Conceit, nay a vaine Conceit; his
words are theſe; <hi>The Conceit of Supply by the two Houſes
in caſe the King refuſe</hi> (to preſerve the Kingdome) <hi>is a
vaine Conceit:</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Book p. 28.</note> and if that be true, then <hi>I</hi> muſt conclude, that
this proviſion of a Temper of three Eſtates is no Temper, no
proviſion, two of the Eſtates are no Eſtates; or elſe this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion
is in the phraſe of Doctor <hi>Ferne,</hi>

            <p>But I conſider, that Mr <hi>Chillingworths</hi> party is alive,
though he be dead; and though one of his Books is buried,
there are many hundred Copies divulged; and therefore
though I ſpeak not of his humane frailties, or perſonall infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
and imperfections, which died with him; yet I may
ſpeak of his Hereticall Book, and of ſome deſtructive policies
he uſed, which doe yet ſurvive in their ſad and lamentable
effects. Iudge what I ſay, put the caſe a man commits noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
crimes ſcandalouſly, becauſe publiquely, and doth not
only hold, but vent damnable hereſies; and vent them not
only in the Pulpit, but in the Preſſe; ſhall not his damnable
hereſies and printed hereſies be confuted after his death? ſhall
thouſands be ſeduced and periſh, and all Orthodox Divines
ſilenced with that one Proverb, <hi>Nothing is to be ſpoken of the
dead but good?</hi> Nay, put the caſe further yet, ſuppoſe a man
hath had his head full of powder-plots, and his heart full of
bloody deſires, nay hath been a Ring-leader and Encourager
of others to bloody practiſes againſt the very light of nature
as well as Scripture; muſt nothing be ſaid of ſuch a man
when he is gone, but good?</p>
            <p>Mr <hi>Chillingworth</hi> and I met in <hi>Suſſex</hi> by an unexpected
providence: I was driven from my owne houſe by force of
Armes, only (as the Cavaliers confeſſed) becauſe I was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated
to be a Member of the Aſſembly: and when I
heard that my Living was beſtowed upon a Doctor (who
if ſome <hi>Cambridge-men</hi> deceive me not, became the <hi>ſtage</hi>
farre better then he doth the <hi>Pulpit)</hi> I reſolved to exerciſe
my Miniſtery in <hi>Suſſex</hi> amongſt my friends, in a place where
there hath been little of the power of Religion either known
<pb facs="tcp:111525:8"/>
or practiſed. About the latter end of <hi>November</hi> I travelled
from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Chicheſter,</hi> according to my uſuall cuſtome,
to obſerve the monthly Faſt; and in my paſſage, with a thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
heart I ſhall ever acknowledge it, I was guarded by a
Convoy of 16 Souldiers, who faced about 200 of the enemies
forces, and put them all to flight. Upon the twelfth of <hi>December</hi>
I viſited a brave Souldier of my acquaintance, Captain <hi>James
Temple,</hi> who did that day defend the Fort at <hi>Bramber</hi> againſt a
bold daring enemy, to the wonder of all the countrey: and I
did not marvell at it, for he is a man that hath his head full of
ſtratagems, his heart full of piety and valour, and his hand as
full of ſucceſſe as it is of dexterity: My gratefull pen might wel
run on in his commendation, to the eternall ſhame of thoſe
who have been ungratefull to him, to whom they doe (under
God) owe their preſervation. But I intend not to defraud
others of their deſerved praiſe, who were preſent at that fierce
encounter. There was preſent Colonell <hi>Harbert Morley,</hi> a
Gentleman of a nimble apprehenſion &amp; vigilant ſpirit; but the
<hi>Cavaliers</hi> were kept at ſuch a diſtance, that they never put the
Colonels Regiment of horſe to any trouble: There was preſent
likewiſe Captaine <hi>Henry Carleton,</hi> the Antiprelaticall ſonne of
a learned Prelate, a man of a bold preſence and fixed reſolution,
who loves his country better then his life. Captain <hi>Simon Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi>
was there alſo, a man of ſlow ſpeech, but ſure performance,
who deſerves that Motto of the old <hi>Romane, Non tam facile
loquor, quam quod locutus ſum praeſto.</hi> You cannot expect that I
ſhould name all the reſt of the Commanders: But there were
(you ſee) ſome difficulties in my way, which ſeemed inſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
and yet the Lord of Hoſts did bring me thorow theſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties
ſafe from <hi>Bramber</hi> to <hi>Arundell,</hi> upon the 21 day of
<hi>December,</hi> if I forget not. Maſter <hi>Chillingworth</hi> was at that
time in <hi>Arundell</hi> Caſtle, which was ſurrendred to the much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned
Commander Sir <hi>William Waller, Serjeant-Major-ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
of all the aſſociated Counties in the Eaſt and Weſt,</hi> upon the
ſixt of <hi>Ianuary.</hi> As ſoone as the Caſtle was ſurrendred, I repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
Maſter <hi>Chillingworths</hi> condition to Sir <hi>William Waller,</hi>
who commended him to the care of his worthy Chaplaine;
<pb facs="tcp:111525:8"/>
and his Chaplaine ſhewed ſo much charity and reſpect towards
him, that he laid him upon his owne bed, and ſupplied him with
all neceſſaries which the place did afford. When the reſt of
the Priſoners were ſent up to <hi>London,</hi> Maſter <hi>Chillingworth</hi>
made it evident to me, that he was not able to endure ſo long
a journey; and if he had been put to it, he had certainly died
by the way: I deſired therefore that his journey might bee
ſhortned, and upon my humble motion he was ſent to <hi>Chiche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi>
where I intreated the <hi>Governour</hi> that he might be ſecured
by ſome Officer of his acquaintance, and not put into the
hands of the <hi>Marſhall;</hi> the Governour gave order that Liev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant
<hi>Golledge</hi> ſhould take charge of him, and placed him in

others: There muſt be no delayes either of time or money.</p>
                  <p>I heare that Master <hi>Chillingworths</hi> Siſter, whom hee hath
made Executrix, is travelling with childe, and therefore unfit
for travell, but he is very confident ſhe will not let him want for
neceſſary ſupplies whileſt he lives, and that hee may have decent
buriall (befitting one of his merit) if it pleaſeth God he chance to
dye. Among other of his friends, I pray acquaint Doctor <hi>Shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi>

                        <head>The teſtimony of Maſter Edmonds.</head>
                        <p>A Friend ſtanding by him, deſired him to declare himſelfe in
point of Religion, for two reaſons: firſt, Becauſe the Ieſuites
had much defamed and traduced him in that particular: ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
Becauſe he might be able to give an account to his friends, in
caſe he ſhould ſurvive. He anſwered, he had declared himſelfe
already in that point ſufficiently to the world. His friend told
him, that there went abroad ſome hard opinions that he had of
Ieſus Chriſt, and wiſht him to deale candidly and plainly to the
world in that point. He anſwered, for thoſe things he was ſetled
and reſolved, and therefore did not deſire to be further troubled.
Being demanded, what courſe ſhould be taken for his interment,
in caſe God ſhould take him away in this place; he replied, that
where ever God ſhould pleaſe to take him, he would there be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terred;
<pb facs="tcp:111525:10"/>
and (if it might be obtained) according to the cuſtome of
the Church of <hi>England;</hi> if not, the Lords will be done. And
further (ſaid hee) becauſe the world will be apt to ſurmiſe the
worſt of things, and there may be ſome inquiry made after my
uſage in this place, I muſt teſtifie and declare to all the world, that
I have received both of Maſter <hi>Golledge</hi> and his wife, abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of love, care, and tenderneſſe, where I deſerved it not; and
that I have wanted nothing which might be deſired of them: and
I must in all conſcience and honeſty doe them this right, to teſtifie
the truth to the world: or to that effect.</p>

            </q>
            <p>And for my part, I beleeve that in the courſe of nature hee
might have recovered, had he not neglected and diſtruſted an
able Doctor (who freely offered himſelfe) onely becauſe hee
was Phyſician to Sir <hi>William Waller;</hi> ſure I am that jealouſie
was more deadly then his diſeaſe. Yet Maſter <hi>Chillingworth</hi>
did, when it was too late, diſcover and confeſſe his errour, and
we perſwaded the Doctor to viſit him afterwards, and he was in
an hopefull way of recovery: but then his ſpirit was much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected,
becauſe his friends neglected, or delayed, to ſend him
ſome good newes from <hi>Oxford:</hi> his heart was ſo ſet upon his
releaſe, and his head was ſtill working and projecting, how he
might be exchanged, or ranſomed; and therefore certainly
the Newes of his friends active endevours for his releaſe, was
the <hi>onely Cordiall</hi> which could poſſibly revive his ſpirits; and for
want of ſuch a Cordiall his heart was even dead within him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he died. I entreated him to plucke up his ſpirits, and not
to yeeld to his diſeaſe; but I perceived, that though Reaſon
be <hi>ſtout</hi> when it encounters with faith, yet reaſon is not <hi>ſo va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant</hi>
when it is to encounter with affliction: and I cannot but
obſerve, <hi>that many a Parliament-ſouldier hath been more chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
in a priſon, then this diſcourſing Engineer, and learned Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
was in a Palace:</hi> Beleeve it, Reader, beleeve it, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
gifts, nor parts, nor profeſſion, nor any thing elſe but <hi>faith,</hi>
will ſuſtaine the ſpirit of a man in ſpirituall ſtraights and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
encombrances, when <hi>without there are fightings, and within
there are fears.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:111525:11"/>
Another reaſon there was, which (as I conceive) was very
deſtructive to this <hi>Man of Reaſon;</hi> he was diſreliſhed, and (I
beleeve) abuſed by moſt of the great Officers who were taken
Priſoners in <hi>Arundell-caſtle;</hi> they looked upon him as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truder
into their councells of warre, and (as one of them whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered)
the <hi>Queens intelligencer,</hi> who was ſet as a Spie over
them and all their proceedings. When Major <hi>Molins</hi> came to
treat, hee ſpake very coldly for Maſter <hi>Chillingworth;</hi> and a
greater Commander then he, told me, that they were bound
to curſe <hi>that little Prieſt</hi> to the pit of hell, for he had been the
ruine of them all: I replyed in his behalfe, that I wondered
much that they ſhould make ſo weake an Apology, for I could
not beleeve that Maſter <hi>Chillingworths</hi> ſingle Vote could turn
their Councell of warre round, and make them giddy: The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious
Gentleman made uſe of the liberty of his judgement,
and replyed; <q>Sir, Maſter <hi>Chillingworth</hi> hath ſo much credit
at the Court, and the Court-councell hath ſo much influence
into our military Councell, that we were even over-awed,
and durſt not contradict Maſter <hi>Chillingworth,</hi> for feare leſt
our owne reſolutions might ſucceed ill, and then his counſell
would have been eſteemed the better.</q> I told the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
that I thought Maſter <hi>Chillingworth</hi> wanted experience
for the ordering of military affaires, and therefore could not
well apply the generall rules of reaſon aright, and bring them
downe to practiſe in caſes which were difficult, becauſe unuſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.
The Gentleman replyed, <q>Sir, Maſter <hi>Chillingworth</hi> is
ſo confident of his great wit and parts, that hee conceives
himſelfe able to manage martiall affaires, in which hee hath
no experience, by the ſtrength of his owne wit and reaſon:</q>
Sir (quoth I) you may forgive him, for though I hope to bee
<hi>ſaved by faith,</hi> yet Maſter <hi>Chillingworth</hi> hopes that a man may
be <hi>ſaved by reaſon,</hi> and therefore you may well give him leave
to fight by reaſon. Sir (ſaith that witty Gentleman) I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
it is a ſad objection, which I know not how to anſwere;
and ſo in ſtead of an anſwere we went to dinner. But I did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
the buſineſſe impartially afterwards, and perceive that
theſe great Commanders have groſſely abuſed Maſter <hi>Chilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:111525:11"/>
in laying all the blame upon him, as if he were guilty of
loſing the out-workes, the Towne, the Caſtle, and all; and
therefore I ſhall doe Maſter <hi>Chillingworth</hi> ſo much right, as to
offer ſome conſiderations, which may tend to his excuſe or vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication:
For what though Maſter <hi>Chillingworth</hi> were the
grand-Engineer at <hi>Glocester</hi> and <hi>Arundel,</hi> and both projects
failed, the fault might be in the Officers and Souldiers, and not
in the Engineer: Put the caſe the Lord <hi>Hopton,</hi> Baron of
<hi>Stratton,</hi> Field-Marſhall-generall of the Weſt, promiſe to
bring three thouſand men, and the Engineer make a line of
Communication which cannot be defended with fewer then
two thouſand; but the field-Marſhall doth in the mean time
forget himſelfe, and quarter his men in three or foure Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples;
but his enemy being a more <hi>wary and prudent Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
keeps his men in a contracted and compact body, which is
too ſtrong for the beſt of his Maniples, and falls upon one of the
field-Marſhals Quarters, takes and kills neare upon a thouſand
men, and the field-Marſhall by ſuch an unexpected blow
is utterly diſabled for the fulfilling of his promiſe, of ſending
three thouſand, nay is not able to ſend above 1500 men: ſhall
the Engineer or the field-Marſhall be blamed in ſuch a caſe?</p>
            <p>Nay, what if the enemy advance before the Engineer hath
quite finiſhed his workes? yet if he hath made them defenſible
againſt any ſudden onſet, and the Souldiers, which ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
the works, quit their Trenches, and runne all away, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
any one man be ſlaine in the Trenches, ſhall the Engineere
be blamed in ſuch a caſe, or the Souldiers, who were ſtricken
with feare when there was no conſiderable cauſe of feare?</p>
            <p>Finally, if the Lord of Hoſts, who did ſtrike a terrour to the
very heart of the Souldiers, doe ſhew himſelfe a God of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and infatuate the counſels of the grand <hi>Achitophels;</hi> nay,
ſhew himſelfe a ſin-revenging God, and ſmite the Souldiers
in the Caſtle with deadly diſeaſes, <hi>with one Pox more then they
carried in with them, with the Flux, the Calenture, the ſpotted.
Feaver, and the like:</hi> if in the midſt of theſe diſtreſſes the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
breake forth into a <hi>mutinous flame,</hi> and ſet all their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
in a combuſtion, muſt the Engineer bee blamed if the
<pb facs="tcp:111525:12"/>
Caſtle be ſurrendred in ſuch a caſe? Now I appeale to their
Councell of Warre, whether their caſe were not ſo like to
theſe caſes which have beene put, that it is hard to ſay
wherein they differed. Let not then Maſter <hi>Chillingworth</hi> be
charged with more faults then he was guilty of; I cannot but
vindicate his reputation from all falſe aſperſions, which are caſt
upon him by ſome who know not how to excuſe themſelves:
I tooke all the care I could of his body whileſt he was ſicke, and
will (as farre as he was innocent) take care of his fame and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
now he is dead: nay, whileſt he was alive, I tooke care
of ſomething more precious then his health or reputation, to
wit, his precious and beloved ſoule; for in compaſſion to his
foule I dealt freely and plainly with him, and told him that he
had been very active in fomenting theſe bloudy warres againſt
the Parliament and Common-wealth of England, his naturall
countrey, and by conſequent, againſt the very light of nature:
<q>I acknowledge (ſaith he) that I have beene active in theſe
warres, but I have ever followed the dictates of my conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
and if you convince me that I am in an errour, you
ſhall not finde me obſtinate.</q> I told him, I conceived that he
might want ſleep, being at that time newly come out of the
Caſtle, and therefore I gave him time to refreſh himſelfe: and
when I came to him againe, I asked him whether he was fit
for diſcourſe; he told me, yes, but ſomewhat faintly: I certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
him, that I did not deſire to take him at the loweſt, when
his ſpirits were flatted and his reaſon diſturbed, but had much
rather undertake him when he was at the higheſt, becauſe I
came prepared to receive ſatisfaction, and looked upon my ſelfe
as unlikely to give ſatisfaction to one, whom I acknowledged
ſo much above mee, in regard of his parts, gifts, experience;
he having ſtudied bookes and men, and more accurately diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſed
that queſtion of State then ever I had done. He then
told me, that he was pretty well refreſhed, and as able (as he uſed
to be in theſe times of diſtraction) for any diſcourſe about that
great controverſie of State. He deſired me to begin: I ſatisfied
his deſire, and told him that it would be very requiſite in the
firſt place to ſtate the Queſtion aright; for (as I conceived)
<pb facs="tcp:111525:12"/>
many ingenious men were groſſely miſtaken even in the very
ſtate of the Queſtion.</p>
            <p>Firſt then be pleaſed (quoth I) to conſider, that <hi>the originall
difference was not between the King and the Parliament,</hi> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the <hi>Parliament</hi> and <hi>Delinquents;</hi> and indeed, betweene
the <hi>Queen and the Parliament:</hi> I told him, that hee could not
be ignorant that upon the fourth of <hi>January,</hi> two yeares agoe,
<hi>the King went unto the Parliament upon the Queens errand;</hi> and I
beleeved that he knew better then I, how much <hi>the Queen was
diſcontented, becauſe her bloody deſigne was not put in execution:</hi>
He told me, <hi>that he could not deny it, and he would not excuſe it.</hi>
When I was going on to diſcourſe about other matters of fact,
he confeſſed very honeſtly, that he did now perceive, <hi>that they
had no certaine information of matters of fact at Oxford:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
I perceived that it was no wonder that ſo many brave men
were ſeduced to fight againſt the Parliament.</p>
            <p>Vpon further diſcourſe, he told me that he obſerved a great
deale of piety in the Commanders and Souldiers of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
Army: <q>I confeſſe (ſath he) their diſcourſe and beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
doth ſpeake them Chriſtians, but I can finde little of
God or godlineſſe in our men; they will not ſeeke God
whileſt they are in their bravery, nor truſt him when they are
in diſtreſſe; I have much adoe (ſaith he) to bring them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their knees, to call upon God, or to reſigne themſelves up
to God, when they goe on upon any deſperate ſervice, or are
caſt into any perplexed condition.</q> I liked him well, when I
heard him run on ſo fluently to this effect, and I cloſed with
him, and deſired him to tell me freely, whether in good earneſt
he thought the Parliament did intend any thing elſe then the
<hi>taking of the wicked from before the King, the eſtabliſhing of the
Kings throne in juſtice,</hi> the <hi>ſetting up of Chriſts ordinances</hi> in
power, purity, liberty, and the <hi>ſetling of the knowne lawes of the
land, the priviledges of the Parliament, and liberties of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
in quiet and peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Sir (ſaith he) I muſt acknowledge that I doe verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
that the intentions of the Parliament are better then
the intentions of the Court, or of that Army which I have
<pb facs="tcp:111525:13"/>
followed; but I conceive that the Parliament takes a wrong
courſe to proſecute and accompliſh their good intentions;
for warre is not the way of Ieſus Chriſt.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Truely I was aſhamed to diſpute with him any longer,
when he had given me ſo much advantage: For firſt, he clearly
condemned himſelfe for being confederate with them, whoſe
intentions were deſtructive; becauſe no man muſt promote an
ill deſigne by any meanes whatſoever, be they never ſo law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.
Secondly, he confeſſed himſelfe cleane out of his way
when he was in Armes; for warre, ſaith he, (and he learnt to
ſay ſo of the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> and <hi>Socinians)</hi> is not the way of Ieſus
Chriſt; all that he could ſay for himſelfe was, that he had no
command in the Army; and yet their greateſt Officers told
me, that in a true conſtruction there was no man elſe that had
a command to any purpoſe, but Maſter <hi>Chillingworth.</hi> And as
touching their intentions, it is no hard matter to gueſſe at the
intentions of the French and Spaniſh faction at Court, or the
<hi>Iriſh intentions of the Papiſts, Prelates, Delinquents, &amp;c. that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the Queens Army.</hi> I am ſure one of the Captains that was
taken Priſoner at <hi>Arundell, had a Spaniſh head, a French noſe,
and an Iriſh heart:</hi> And there was a Letter found in <hi>Arundell</hi>-Caſtle,
which was directed to Maſter <hi>Beckingham,</hi> the Earle of
<hi>Arundels</hi> Receiver, which doth declare the good intentions
of the Queens Army. I took a copy of it, which I will here

            <p>There was a Commiſſion found there likewiſe (which doth

&amp;c.</hi> to ſecure the perſons of all men in <hi>Suſſex,</hi> who had contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted

Commander in chiefe of all his Majeſties forces in <hi>Surrey, Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſex,
Kent, &amp;c.</hi> Now their intentions are as you ſee: And as
touching the meanes uſed, Maſter <hi>Chillingworth</hi> himſelf would
not ſay that the Queen and her adherents, Prelates, Papiſts,
Delinquents, Malignants, of the French conſpiracy, the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi>
faction, or the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebellion, and their confederates, doe
take better courſes, and uſe more lawfull meanes to accompliſh

have ſeene (for hee had light enough to ſee) the way of Jeſus
Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I deſired him to tell me,</hi> whether the higheſt Court of juſtice

be tryed according to Law?</p>
            <p>Firſt, hee acknowledged that the Parliament is the higheſt
Court; and therefore (I conclude) not to be controlled by
ſome few of the Kings Councell, or by a pretended Aſſembly,
conſiſting of Fugitives and Delinquents. Secondly, ſaith he,
I muſt deale plainly with you, though the Parliament hath

voted ſome to be Delinquents, and the Queen her ſelfe to be a
Traitour, yet I doe not beleeve that their judgement is infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible.
I was able to anſwere him out of his owne booke, that
<hi>the judgment of a Court or perſon</hi> (eſpecially where there is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of the fact) <hi>may be certaine, though that Court or perſon
be not infallible:</hi> Secondly, though the judgment of the higheſt
Court be not <hi>infallible,</hi> yet <hi>it is finall, and therefore we cannot
appeale from the judgement of the Parliament, to any Court, but
the Court of heaven.</hi> True, (ſaith Maſter <hi>Chillingworth)</hi> but
this is it which ſtickes with me, that there is no fundamentall
conſtitution for the government of this Kingdome <hi>by a ſtanding
Parliament:</hi> To which I had many anſwers to returne; firſt,
there is a fundamentall conſtitution for the government of this
Kingdome by the three Eſtates: ſecondly, there is a Law for
the frequency of Parliaments: and thirdly, the vertue and
ſtrength of every Parliament continues in the Acts of every
Parliament, by which the Kingdome is governed, even after
the diſſolution of that Parliament; every Parliament doth live
in its unrepealed Acts, and therefore lives even after its diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution;
and in that reſpect wee have many Parliaments yet
ſtanding; <hi>ſome old</hi> Eliſabeth-<hi>Parliaments doe as yet live, breath,
move, and operate, with ſtrength and vigour:</hi> fourthly, there is
an Act paſſed for the continuance of this Parliament, by the
unanimous conſent of all three Eſtates; <hi>and the Kings Councell
could not find any other probable meanes under heaven for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engaging
of his Majeſty, then the framing and paſſing of that Act
of continuance.</hi> Maſter <hi>Chillingworth</hi> (putting off his hat) cryed,
I acknowledge that Act with all reverence, and <hi>there is your
ſtrength.</hi> He ſeemed pretty well ſatisfied with that anſwere;
and as touching <hi>the way of Jeſus Christ,</hi> I deſired to know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Saints were not to make warre againſt the Whore and
the Beaſt? Whether it be not an act of charity, for Proteſtants
to lay downe their lives for their Brethren? Whether it be not
an act of faith, to waxe valiant in fight for the defence of that
faith, which was once delivered to the Saints? I perceived
my Gentleman ſomewhat puzled, and I tooke my leave, that
he might take his reſt.</p>

My heart was moved with compaſſion towards him, and
I gave him many viſits after this firſt viſit; but I ſeldome
found him in fit caſe to diſcourſe, becauſe his diſeaſe grew
ſtronger and ſtronger, and he weaker and weaker: I deſ<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>red
to know his opinion concerning that <hi>Liturgy</hi> which hath beene

that <hi>there were ſome truths which the Miniſters of the Goſpel
are not bound upon paine of damnation to publiſh to the people:</hi>
and indeed he conceived it very unfit to publiſh any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Common-Prayer-Book, or the Book of Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
&amp;c. <hi>for feare of ſcandall.</hi> I was ſorry to heare ſuch an
anſwer drop from a dying man and I conceived it could not but
be much more ſcandalous, to ſeduce or hoodwink the people,
then to inſtruct and edifie them in a point which did <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
concerne the publike worſhip of God in this Land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>When I found him pretty hearty one day, I deſired him
to tell me,</hi> whether he conceived that a man living and dying
a Turk, Papiſt, or Socinian, could be ſaved?</p>
            <p>All the anſwer that I could gaine from him was, <hi>that he
did not abſolve them, and would not condemne them.</hi> I was
much diſpleaſed with the anſwer upon divers reaſons: Firſt,
becauſe the queſtion was put home, of a man living and dying,
ſo or ſo. Secondly, it was frivolous to talk of Abſolution,
for it was out of queſtion that he could not abſolve them.
Thirdly, it ſhewed that he was too well perſwaded of Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſm
and Socinianiſm, which runne exactly parallel in too
many points. Fourthly, he ſeems to Anathematize the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinians
in the Preface to the Author of Charity, maintained
Sect. 28. when <hi>Knot</hi> had reckoned up ſome Socinian Tenets,
Mr <hi>Chillingworth</hi> anſwers, <hi>Whoſoever teaches or holds them,
let him be Anathema.</hi> I have not <hi>Knots</hi> Book by me now, I
meane his direction to <hi>N. N.</hi> and Mr <hi>Chillingworth</hi> was ſo
wiſe as not to reckon up the number of thoſe impious doctrins,
or name them in particular, becauſe they were all fathered
upon him, and he would not aſſiſt Mr <hi>Knot</hi> ſo farre in the
ſpreading of his owne undeſerved defamation, <hi>ibid.</hi> Sect. 28.
<pb facs="tcp:111525:16"/>
I am afraid that <hi>Knot</hi> reckoned up too many points of Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nianiſm,
or did not forme his Interrogations aright, and then
Mr <hi>Chillingworth</hi> might ſafely anathematize, and yet be a
<hi>Socinian</hi> in many points which were not reckoned up, or not
well expreſſed; And yet his Anathema is warily pronounced,
he doth not ſay, Whoſoever teaches or holds them or any of
them, let him be Anathema. Moreover, if the Socinians be
asked, whether Chriſt be God, they will ſay, Yes; but then
they meane that he is the Sonne of God, borne after an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
manner by the overſhadowing of the holy Ghoſt,
<hi>Luke</hi> 1. 31, 32, 35. or that the word of God came unto him,
and therefore is called God, becauſe of his extraordinary Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
from God, or the like, <hi>Iohn</hi> 10. 35. Now either Mr
<hi>Chillingworth</hi> was guilty of ſome ſuch equivocation and fly
evaſion, or elſe he grew worſe and worſe, and would not ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematize
a groſſe Socinian. And if in theſe latter dayes Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducers
grow worſe and worſe, I ſhall not wonder at it, 2 Tim.
3. 13.</p>
            <p>When Mr <hi>Chillingworth</hi> ſaw himſelfe entangled in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes,
he deſired me that I would deale charitably with him,
for, ſaith he, I was ever a charitable man: my anſwer was
ſomewhat tart, and therefore the more charitable, conſidering
his condition, and the counſell of the Apoſtle, <hi>Titus 1. 13. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke
them ſharply,</hi> or (as <hi>Beza</hi> hath it) <hi>preciſely, that they may
be ſound in the faith;</hi> And I deſire not to conceale my tart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
it was to this effect: Sir, it is confeſſed that you have
beene very exceſſive in your charity; <hi>you have laviſhed out ſo
much charity upon Turks, Socinians, Papiſts, that I am afraid
you have very little to ſpare for a truly reformed Proteſtant;
ſure I am, the zealous Protestants finde very little charity at
Oxford.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The laſt time I viſited him, was on the Lords day, for I
thought it a Sabbath-duty, and then he began to ſpeak of
ſome queſtions which I formerly propounded to him, whereof
this was one; <hi>Whether Tyranny was Gods Ordinance?</hi> I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
took him off from that diſcourſe, becauſe I knew he had
beene laid up faſt by that argument before; for it is impoſſible
<pb facs="tcp:111525:16"/>
that any man ſhould ever prove, that Tyranny is not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
upon this ground, becauſe we muſt not reſiſt Gods Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance,
unleſſe they could prove, that which is <hi>blaſphemy to
mention, viz. That Tyranny is Gods Ordinance.</hi> I deſired him
that he would now take off his thoughts from all matters of
<hi>Speculation,</hi> and fix upon ſome practicall point which might
make for his <hi>Edification.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He thanked me (as I hope) very heartily, and told me that
in all points of Religion he was ſetled, and had fully expreſſed
himſelfe for the ſatisfaction of others in his Book, which was
approved and licenſed by very learned and judicious Divines.
Upon further diſcourſe I began to tell him what meditation
did moſt comfort me in times of Extremity: and I added that
the meditation was very proper for a man in his condition, if
he could lay hold upon the <hi>Covenant of Grace.</hi> I made choiſe
of that Scripture, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. the five firſt verſes; and I began
to open the fifth verſe a little to him: I told him that all our
hopes of ſalvation are grounded upon the Covenant of Grace,
for it is a ſure Covenant, an ordered Covenant, nay, a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
in all things ordered and ſure, an everlaſting Covenant,
a ſaving Covenant; they were <hi>Davids</hi> laſt words, <hi>this is all
my ſalvation.</hi> And I preſſe this point the rather, becauſe he
doth acknowledge in his Book, that the Doctrine about the
Covenant is a Fundamentall Doctrine; and becauſe his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
are very imperfect and obſcure in his ſubtle Book,
I was in good hope that he would have explained himſelfe
more fully and clearly in that Fundamentall point; but I could
not obtaine what I deſired. Not long after I told him, that
I did uſe to pray for him in private, and asked him whether
it was his deſire that I ſhould pray for him in publique: he
anſwered, yes, with all his heart; and he ſaid withall, that he
hoped he ſhould fare the better for my prayers.</p>
            <p>I obſerved that Mr <hi>Chillingworth</hi> was much troubled with
a ſore throat, and oppreſſed with tough phlegme, which would
certainly choak him up<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if there were not ſome ſudden re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy.
I ſent therefore to a Chirurgeon, one of Mr <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingworths</hi>
beliefe, an able man, that pleaſed him well, and
<pb facs="tcp:111525:17"/>
gave him ſome eaſe. And the next day being Munday, at
our morning-exerciſe in the Cathedrall, I deſired the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
and Citizens that they would in their prayers remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
the diſtreſſed eſtate of Mr <hi>Chillingworth</hi> a ſick Priſoner
in the City, <hi>a man very eminent for the ſtrength of his parts,
the excellency of his gifts, and the depth of his learning:</hi> I told
them that they were commanded to love their enemies, and
therefore were bound to pray for them, eſpecially when God
moved the heart of an enemy to deſire their prayers: We
prayed heartily that God would be pleaſed to beſtow <hi>ſaving
graces</hi> as well as <hi>excellent gifts</hi> upon him, that ſo all his gifts
might be improved and ſanctified: we deſired that God
would give him new light, and new eyes, that he might ſee,
acknowledge, and recant his errours, that he might deny
his carnall reaſon, and ſubmit to faith: that God would
bleſſe all meanes which were uſed for his recovery, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I beleeve none of his friends or my enemies can deny that
we made a reſpectfull and Chriſtian mention of him in our
prayers. The ſame day I rid to <hi>Arundel</hi> to move the Doctor
to come over againe to viſit Mr <hi>Chillingworth,</hi> but the
Doctour was ſent for out of Town (before I got thither)
to viſit Sir <hi>William Springot,</hi> and ſo I loſt my journey, and
the Doctour ſaw him no more. In my abſence a religious
Officer of <hi>Chicheſter</hi> garriſon followed my ſuit to Mr <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingworth,</hi>
and entreated him to declare himſelfe in point
of Religion; but Mr <hi>Chillingworth</hi> appealed to his Book
againe, and ſaid he was ſetled, as you may ſee it more largely
ſet down in Mr <hi>Edmonds</hi> his Teſtimony before. From my
firſt viſitation of Mr <hi>Chillingworth</hi> to the laſt, I did not
finde him in a condition which might any way move mee
(had I beene his deadly enemy) <hi>either to flatter or envy him,
but rather to pity and pray for him,</hi> as you ſee I did. I dare
appeale to his eminent and learned friends, whether there
could bee more <hi>mercy</hi> ſhewn to his <hi>body,</hi> or <hi>charity</hi> to his
<hi>ſoule,</hi> whilſt he was alive? Conſider what it is worth to
have a fortnights ſpace to repent in. O what would <hi>Dives</hi>
have proffered for ſuch a mercy? if Mr <hi>Chillingworth</hi> did
<pb facs="tcp:111525:17"/>
not emprove it, that was not fault of mine; And ſhall not my
charity to his ſoule and body whileſt he was alive, acquit me
from being uncharitable towards him after his death? No rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
man will deeme mee guilty of ſuch an uncharitable
madneſſe as to be angry with a carcaſſe, or to goe wreſtle with
a ghoſt; for I conſider that his ghoſt might cry <hi>in faciem ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peli,</hi>
Bury me with my face downward, if you pleaſe, for when
the <hi>Macedonians</hi> (give me leave to change the ſtory a little,
and ſay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when the <hi>Iriſh)</hi> come, and they were then neare us,
they will <hi>turn all upſide down:</hi> I am no <hi>Sylla,</hi> I did not give any
command to ſcatter the reliques of <hi>Marius:</hi>

               </note> though I have
not much Wiſedome, yet I have more charity then to deſerve
that laſh of the Oratour, <hi>He had beene more wiſe had he beene

violent <hi>for Chriſt</hi> and <hi>Heaven,</hi> and my paſſions are too often as
hot as my zeale, but They may beare with ſmall faults, and in
this buſineſſe I have proceeded with deliberation and modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
I conſider that I am in the body, and my body may be
delivered (I know not how ſoone) into the enemies hand; I
doe not expect (though I might deſire) that halfe that mercy
which I ſhewed to Maſter <hi>Chillingworth</hi> may be ſhewen to
me; <hi>Defunctorum cineribus violentiam inferre ſacrilega prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptio

I ſhall be able to juſtifie my carriage in the buſineſſe of his Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall

or ſacriledge,
<q>
                  <l>Sacrilegae buſtis abſtinuere manus.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Let us (if you pleaſe) take a view of all our proceedings, and
of Maſter <hi>Chillingworths</hi> opinions, and then (I am afraid) ſome
will ſay there was a little fooliſh pity ſhewed on my part and
the uncharitableneſſe will be found in them onely, who cenſure
me for want of charity.</p>
            <p>Firſt, there were all things which may any way appertaine
to the <hi>civility</hi> of a funerall, though there was nothing which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to the <hi>ſuperſtition</hi> of a funerall: His body was decently
<pb facs="tcp:111525:18"/>
laid in a convenient coff<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n, covered with a <hi>mourning Herſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth,</hi>
more ſeemly (as I conceive) then the uſuall covering,
patched up <hi>out of the mouldy reliques of ſome moth-eaten copes:</hi>
His friends were entertained (according to their owne deſire)
with Wine and Cakes; though that is, in my conceit, a <hi>turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the houſe of mourning into an houſe of banqueting:</hi> All
that offered themſelves to carry his corps out of pure devotion,
becauſe they were <hi>men of his perſwaſion,</hi> had every one of them
(according to the cuſtome of the countrey) a branch of Roſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary,
amourning Ribband, and a paire of Gloves. But (as it
doth become an impartiall Hiſtorian) I confeſſe there were
three ſeverall opinions concerning his buriall.</p>
            <p>The firſt opinion was negative and peremptory, That hee
ought not to be buried like a Chriſtian, 1. Who refuſed to
make a full and free confeſſion of Chriſtian Religion: 2. Nay,
if there had been nothing elſe againſt him, but his taking up of
Armes againſt his countrey, that they conceived a ſufficient
reaſon to deny the buriall of his corps. I will not trouble you
with many reaſons, that one place of Scripture was to them in
ſtead of many reaſons, to prove that an Heathen might be buried
in all the outward pompe and glory that can be deviſed, rather
then one who hath deſtroyed his owne land, and ſlaine his own
people, <hi>Iſa. 14. 18, 19, 20. All the Kings of the Nations, even
all of them lye in glory, every one in his owne houſe; But thou art
caſt out of thy grave, like an abominable branch, and as the rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of thoſe that are ſlaine, thruſt thorow with a ſword, that go
downe to the ſtones of the pit, as a carcaſſe trodden under feet:
Thou ſhalt not be joyned with them in buriall, becauſe thou haſt
deſtroyed thy land, and ſlaine thy people,</hi> (marke that Reaſon:)
<hi>the ſeed of evill doers ſhall never bee renowned.</hi> In the third
place, ſome were bold to ſay that he was <hi>Felo de ſe,</hi> guilty of
his owne death, by his foole-hardineſſe. Finally, it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
that he was an Heretick, no member of any of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Churches, and therefore to be reckoned as an Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
perſon; now you know what law it is which deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
buriall to Heretikes, and Excommunicated perſons, though
they be excommunicated for inconformity onely, for not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing,
<pb facs="tcp:111525:18"/>
or not paying of 3. s. 4. d. or ſome ſuch like cauſe;
Read <hi>Pickerings Caſe</hi> in the high Commiſſion. The truth is,
we looked upon Maſter <hi>Chillingworth</hi> as a kinde of Non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſt,
nay (to ſpeake ſtrictly) a Recuſant rather then a Non-conformiſt;
for Non-conformiſts refuſe to ſubſcribe to <hi>Canons</hi>
which <hi>concerne Diſcipline,</hi> but Maſter <hi>Chillingworth</hi> refuſed to
ſubſcribe ſome <hi>Articles of Religion,</hi> as he himſelfe acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
though he thought charitably of them who did ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
them: For (he ſaith) he doth not undertake the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
defence of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> but the <hi>common cauſe of
Proteſtants;</hi> and yet he doth not hold the doctrine of all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants
true, becauſe they hold contradictions, yet he concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
them free from all errour deſtructive of ſalvation: and
though he did make ſcruple of <hi>ſubſcribing the truth of one or
two Propoſitions, yet he thought himſelfe fit enough to maintaine,
that thoſe who doe ſubſcribe them are in a ſaveable condition,</hi> See
the Preface to the Author of Charity maintained Sect. 39.
You ſee Maſter <hi>Chillingworth</hi> did refuſe to ſubſcribe. What
thinke ye (Gentlemen are not <hi>Chicheſter</hi> men pretty good
Diſputants? Can you confute theſe Reaſons? If you can; doe
your beſt; if you cannot, I have no reaſon to prompt you;
ſcratch your heads, beat your deskes, bite your nailes, and I
will goe ſleep, and will not heare what they ſaid of Maſter
<hi>Chillingworths</hi> Argument on <hi>Fieldings</hi> caſe.</p>
            <p>The ſecond opinion was your opinion, and the opinion of
ſuch as you are, my good friends at <hi>Athens;</hi> the men of a
Cathedrall ſpirit thought it fit that Maſter <hi>Chillingworth,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a member of a Cathedrall, ſhould be buried in the Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drall;
and being <hi>Cancellarius,</hi> it was conceived that he ſhould
be buried <hi>intra cancellos,</hi> and rot under the Altar, neare the
pot of Incenſe, that the conſtant perfume of the Incenſe might
excuſe the thrift of his Executrix—<hi>Oſſa inodora dedit.</hi> It
was anſwered, that he was of or belonging to the Cathedrall
at <hi>Sarum,</hi> and therefore they might carry him thither; but
then his Will could not be performed, becauſe he deſired to
be buried at <hi>Chicheſter,</hi> in caſe he did end his dayes in that Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
But ſome more ſerious conceived, that this deſire of bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
<pb facs="tcp:111525:19"/>
him <hi>intra cancellos</hi> was but the iſſue of a ſuperſtitious
conceit, that the Chancell, or <hi>ſanctum ſanctorum,</hi> was more
holy then other places; and the carcaſſe of a Prieſt as ſacred
as that holy ground: And it was their opinion that a modeſt
and well-grounded deniall of this requeſt, would be the moſt
effectuall confutation of that ſuperſtitious conceit. The ground
of the deniall was Maſter <hi>Chillingworths</hi> phantaſie, <hi>viz.</hi> That
there are two wayes to make men faithfull, (and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to bring them to Heaven) without either neceſſity of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
or Church; his words are theſe; And Saint <hi>Paul</hi> tells us,
that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> might be knowne by his workes, and that
they had the Law written in their hearts: <hi>Either of theſe wayes
might make ſome faithfull men, without either neceſſity of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
or Church,</hi> Cap. 2. Sect. 124. pag. 100. the firſt Edition:
Now ſhew me any place of Scripture (ſay they) to prove that
ſuch a mans corps ſhould be buried in the Church, who main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
that men may be ſaved without Church or Scripture.
This paſſage is the more obſervable, becauſe in ſome places of
his booke he would beare us in hand, that he doth not thinke
that Heathens ſhall be immediately ſaved without faith in
Chriſt; <hi>See chap 3. Sect. 13. pag.</hi> 133. but you ſee he doth not
mince the matter in the place fore-cited, for it is cleare and
evident that there is <hi>nothing of the Goſpel written in the heart
by nature, or in any of the workes of God by the firſt creation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third opinion (which prevailed) was this, that it would
be fitteſt to <hi>permit the men of his owne perſwaſion, out of meere
humanity, to bury their dead out of our ſight;</hi> and to bury him
in the <hi>cloyſters,</hi> amongſt the old Shavelings, Monkes, and
Prieſts, of whom he had ſo good an opinion all his life.</p>
            <p>The Prelaticall men doe conceive, that there is a kinde of
holineſſe in a <hi>cloyſter;</hi> no excommunicated perſon muſt be bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
there, unleſſe there be an abſolution ſent, either before
the death of the party, or <hi>to the dead corps,</hi> (which they muſt
call their beloved brother) <hi>becauſe they themſelves are as loth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
and rotten as the corps:</hi> Nay, a Papiſt muſt not be buried
in the Cloyſters without ſpeciall diſpenſation from the Biſhop;
and you know <hi>the Prelates would dispenſe with Papiſts alive or
<pb facs="tcp:111525:19"/>
dead.</hi> It is uſuall to bury men of good rank and quality in
<hi>Collegiate Cloyſters;</hi> and ſure I am, the <hi>Cavaliers</hi> doe not
bury their dead ſo honourably, <hi>though they eſteeme them the
Queenes Martyrs, they throw them into ditches or rivers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Finally, Mr <hi>Chillingworths</hi> bones ſhall reſt without any
diſturbance, he ſhall not be uſed as <hi>Wicliffe</hi> was by Papiſts,
or as <hi>Bucer</hi> was ſerved by the Prelaticall faction at <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi>

men wheeled about a third time, and made an honourable

and therefore we had no Torches or Candles at his grave.

            <p>Obſerve that I ſay, <hi>at the Funerall,</hi> for I know full well
that they had ſome Anniverſary Commemorations, at which
it was uſuall to bring Candles, and burne them at Sepulchers
in honour of the Dead. I remember a famous inſtance in
<hi>Suetonius</hi> in the life of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> there is mention made of
a great company who flocked together at the Tomb-ſtone
of one <hi>Maſgabas,</hi> who had beene dead about a yeare, and
they brought abundance of lights thither, as their cuſtome
was. But it is ſtrongly objected that my great and unanſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
fault was, that I did <hi>in extremo actu deficere,</hi> I refuſed
<pb facs="tcp:111525:20"/>
to bury him my ſelfe, and left it to others: Sirs, I confeſſe
it, and ſhall deale freely and candidly in the buſineſſe.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Mr <hi>Chillingworth</hi> in his life time, deſired to have
ſome part of the Common-prayer-book read over his Corps
at the grave in caſe it ſhould pleaſe God to take him away
into another world by that ſickneſſe. Now I could not yeeld
to this requeſt of his for many reaſons which I need not ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie;
yet I ſhall ſay enough to give ſatisfaction to reaſonable
and modeſt men. I conceive it abſurd and ſinfull to uſe the
ſame forme of words at the buriall of all manner of perſons;
namely, <hi>to inſinuate that they are all elected, that they doe all reſt
in Chriſt, that we have ſure and certaine hope of their ſalvation,</hi>
&amp;c. theſe and the like paſſages I durſt not make uſe of upon

Booke of the Church, and the 17 Chapter.</p>
            <p>They conceived that the Saints continue their love to their
brethren which they left behind them, that therefore they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
to God thoſe particular neceſſities of their brethren,
which were made knowne to them here: nay, they did entreat
Saints, lying on their death-beds, not to forget their friends
on earth when they were tranſlated to heaven. Adde to this,
their reckoning up the names of Martyrs at the Euchariſt; the
Sacrifice of praiſe; the anniverſary commemorations, and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negyricall
Orations, on the ſeverall dayes of their friends

ſatisfied.</p>
            <p>When I read of Funeralls in the old Teſtament,<note place="margin">Gen. 50. 7, 9, and 14 verſes.</note> celebrated
in the preſence of Idolaters mingled with the faithfull ſervants
of God, is there any probability that there were any Prayers
made over the dead corps? would the Idolaters have joined
with the faithfull in any ſpirituall exerciſe of Religion preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the true God? The Heathens had ſtrange conceits, that
by Prayers and Sacrifices <hi>Perſephone</hi> might be appeaſed, and ſo
the deceaſed party fare much the better for the ſacrifices, or the
prayers; (ſhadowed by the Sacrifices) for with them the Devill
was worſhipped, and ſo (as they thought) appeaſed: Read
Doctor <hi>Reynolds</hi> in the firſt Tome of his prelections on the
Apocrypha, pag. 1498. <hi>Itaque Perſephone &amp; ſacrificiis &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibus

Now if prayers were made over the dead by Heathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
Idolaters, and are ſtill made by Romiſh Idolaters; and the
Reformed Churches have no ſuch cuſtome; I humbly conceive
that I ſhall not be condemned by any ſober Chriſtian, for not
imitating Heathens or Papiſts.</p>
            <p>Be pleaſed to obſerve the practiſe of Reformed Churches,
and then you will not deeme me ſingular in my opinion. There
was a Liturgy printed not long ſince, and preſented to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
(let it not be thought the worſe becauſe it came from
<hi>Geneva,</hi> or becauſe it is ſaid to be approved by Mr. <hi>Calvin,</hi> and
the Church of <hi>Scotland)</hi> and in that Liturgy you ſhall find that
there was no great ſtore of Service ſaid or done at the interring
of the dead corps: The corps is reverently brought to the
Grave, without any further Ceremonies; which being buried,
the Miniſter, <hi>if he be preſent</hi> and <hi>required,</hi> (obſerve thoſe two li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitations)
goeth to the Church, <hi>if it be not farre off,</hi> (marke
that likewiſe) and maketh ſome comfortable exhortation to
the people, touching death and reſurrection. You ſee that in
their judgement the corps may be reverently interred without
a Miniſter; yet if he be preſent, there are no prayers appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to be ſaid over the dead body; but the Miniſter is to repaire
to the Church, and preach to the Congregation, as I did upon
the advantage of the like occaſion.</p>
            <p>The practiſe of the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> is ſet forth by that

&amp;c.—</hi> The place of buriall with us is not under the Altar,
or the place of Aſſembling <hi>(the Church)</hi> for the Word or Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,
as Papiſts do, but in ſome publike place, either near the

            <p>But if any of Maſter <hi>Chillingworths Catholike friends at Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>
ſhould ſpeake out, and tell me that there may (as <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi>

<hi>not very bad, after their death;</hi> I will ingenuouſly confeſſe that

of his expreſſions are <hi>inexcuſable:</hi> But to anſwere them
according to their folly, if they conceive that Maſter <hi>Chilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi>
was a Martyr for the Catholike cauſe, they will likewiſe
acknowledge (as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in ſundry places doth) that <hi>to frame
Petitions for a Martyr after his death, is an injury to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr,
and to the cauſe for which he ſuffered.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If any man doe yet remaine unſatisfied, let him conſider,
that had I conceived it fitting to read ſome Service over a dead
corps, yet it could not be expected in reaſon and equity that I
ſhould performe this laſt office to the body of Maſter <hi>Chilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth:</hi>
For it is well knowne, that long before theſe unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
and bloudy warres, <hi>in the times of greateſt compliance,</hi> I
never gave Mr <hi>Chillingworth the right hand of fellowſhip,</hi> but did
freely and conſtantly proteſt againſt thoſe damnable hereſies,
which he did cunningly ſubintroduce &amp; vent in this Kingdom,
not onely whileſt he was <hi>a profeſſed Papiſt,</hi> but ſince his <hi>preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

converſion,</hi> (give me leave to call it ſo) you will ſee there is
good ground for that <hi>diminiſhing</hi> term, when you come to read
the Catechiſm anon. I am not aſhamed to tell the whole <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity,</hi>
the whole <hi>Kingdome,</hi> that I never looked upon Maſter
<hi>Chillingworth as my brother, in a religious reſpect,</hi> for we were
not <hi>men of the ſame Religion, or Communion:</hi> to ſpeak plaine <hi>we
were not members of the ſame Church,</hi> for (as he ſaith truely in
his ſubtile booke) <hi>they who differ in Fundamentall points are not
members of the ſame Church one with another, any more then
Proteſtants are members of the ſame Church with Papists.</hi> Chap.
3. Sect. 9. pag. 131.</p>
            <p>Finally, it was favour enough to permit Maſter <hi>Chilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worths</hi>
diſciples or followers, <hi>the men of his perſwaſion,</hi> to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
this laſt office to their friend and Maſter. Now there was
free liberty granted to all the Malignants in the City to attend
the Herſe, and interre his corps. Sure I am, that if Mr <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingworth</hi>
had beene as Orthodoxe and zealous a Preacher as
<hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt was, he might have had as honourable a buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
as <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt had; for all the honour that <hi>John</hi> had,
was to be buried by his owne Diſciples, <hi>Matth.</hi> 14. 12. If <hi>the
doctrine of this eminent Scholar was hereticall, and his Diſciples
were Malignants, I am not guilty of that difference.</hi> As devout
<hi>Stephen</hi> was carried to his buriall by devout men, ſo is it juſt
and equall that Malignants ſhould carry Malignants to their
grave. By Malignants I meane ſuch kinde of men <hi>who joyne
with the enemy, or are willing upon any occaſion offered to joyne
with him, to promote the Antichriſtian Deſigne now on foot;</hi>
thoſe, and onely thoſe, I call Malignants. When the Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
brought his Herſe to the buriall, I met them at the grave
with Maſter <hi>Chillingworths</hi> booke in my hand; at the buriall
of which booke I conceived it fit to make this little ſpeech

                        <p>BRethren, it was the earneſt deſire of that eminent Scholar,

but his ſecond requeſt (in caſe that were denied him) was, that he
might be buried in this City, after ſuch a manner as might be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
in theſe times of unhappy difference and bloudy warres.
His first requeſt is denied for many reaſons, of which you cannot

tenet, <hi>That there is no neceſſity of Church or Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to make men faithfull men,</hi> in the 100 page of this unhappy

friends and followers, who have attended his Herſe to this <hi>Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotha,</hi>
know, that they <hi>are permitted, out of meere humanity,
to bury their dead out of our ſight.</hi> If they pleaſe to undertake
the buriall of his corps, I ſhall undertake to bury his errours, which
are publiſhed in this ſo much <hi>admired,</hi> yet <hi>unworthy</hi> booke; and
happy would it be for this Kingdome, if this booke and all its fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
could be ſo buried, that they might never riſe more, unleſſe
it were for a confutation; and happy would it have been for the
Author, if he had repented of thoſe errours, that they might ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
riſe for his condemnation; Happy, thrice happy will he be, if
his workes doe not follow him, if they doe never riſe with him, nor
againſt him.</p>
                        <p>Get thee gone then, thou curſed booke, which haſt ſeduced
ſo many precious ſoules; get thee gone, thou corrupt rotten
booke, earth to earth, and duſt to duſt; get thee gone into the

Touching the buriall of his corps, I need ſay no more then
this, It will be moſt proper for <hi>the men of his perſwaſion</hi> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
the body of their deceaſed Friend, Brother, Maſter, to the duſt,
and it will be moſt proper for me to hearken to that counſell of my

            <p>Some conceive that I ſtudied on purpoſe, to picke out the

upon the party deceaſed: but <hi>theſe men erre, not knowing
the Scriptures;</hi> for had I uſed that Prayer at Maſter <hi>Chilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worths</hi>
grave (which was dictated by the Spirit upon the like
occaſion, the fall of a great enemy of <hi>Iſrael, Judges 5. 31.)</hi>
doubtleſſe that Prayer would have reflected more upon the
party deceaſed, and all his ſurviving party: <hi>So let all thine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
periſh, O Lord, but let them that love thee be as the Sunne
when he goes forth in his ſtrength.</hi> They would have beene
more diſpleaſed, had I taken that Text, which is applyed to no

They ſhall not lament for him ſaying, Ah my brother, or, ah
ſiſter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>—ah Lord, or ah his glory: He ſhall be buried with the
buriall of an aſſe, drawne and caſt forth beyond the gates of Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,
Ierem.</hi> 22. 18, 19. Doubtleſſe that man deſerves the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall
of an Aſſe, who beleeves his owne <hi>Reaſon</hi> more then the
<hi>God of truth;</hi> he <hi>that dares not condemne,</hi> nay, <hi>admires</hi> thoſe for
rationall men, who would <hi>reaſon Christ and the holy Ghost out
of their Godhead, and even diſpute them both out of the Trinity,</hi>
doth certainly deſerve the buriall of an Aſſe. <hi>Man is born like

Aſſe; and if he prove an old Colt, and periſh by his <hi>Coltiſh
trickes,</hi> wonder not at the ſharpe cenſure of the holy Ghoſt.
You ſee then there are ſharper Texts then this that I pitched
upon for the ground of my diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, all that underſtand that Text, <hi>Luke</hi> 9. 60. will
acknowledge, that the Text did reflect rather upon the living,
then the dead. But why then was he buried at all? I have
<pb facs="tcp:111525:23"/>
told you already, his followers were permitted to bury him
out of <hi>meere Humanity.</hi> I pleaded for his buriall from that great
example recorded at length by the holy Ghoſt, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. from
the eleventh verſe to the end of the chapter. <hi>Saul</hi> you know
was forſaken of God long before his death; <hi>the ſpirit of the
Lord,</hi> (the excellent gifts and common graces of the Spirit
in particular) the ſpirit of government <hi>departed from him:</hi>
Moreover, <hi>he conſulted a witch,</hi> and by her the <hi>Devill at En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor,</hi>
and an evill ſpirit from the Lord took poſſeſſion of him;
yet <hi>Saul</hi> was ſolemnly buried, bewailed, nay extolled by <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
for thoſe things which were lovely in him, as you may
read in the place forecited, 17, 21, 24. verſes. And I dare
boldly ſay, that I have beene more ſorrowfull for Mr <hi>Chilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth,</hi>
and mercifull to him, then his friends at <hi>Oxford:</hi> his
ſickneſſe and obſtinacy coſt me many a prayer, and many a
teare. I did heartily bewaile the loſſe of ſuch ſtrong parts, and
eminent gifts; the loſſe of ſo much learning and diligence.
Never did I obſerve more acuteneſſe and eloquence ſo exactly
tempered in the ſame perſon: <hi>Diabolus ab illo ornari cupiebat;</hi>
for he had eloquence enough to ſet a faire varniſh upon the
fouleſt deſigne. He was maſter of his learning, he had all his
arguments <hi>in procinctu,</hi> and all his notions <hi>in numerato. Howle
ye firre trees, for a Cedar is fallen:</hi> lament ye <hi>Sophiſters,</hi> for
the Maſter of ſentences (ſhall I ſay) or fallacies is vaniſhed:
wring your hands, and beat your breaſts, <hi>yee Antichristian
Engineers,</hi> for your Arch-engineer is dead, and all his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines
buried with him. Ye daughters of <hi>Oxford</hi> weep over
<hi>Chillingworth,</hi> for he had a conſiderable and hopefull project
how to clothe you and himſelfe in ſcarlet, <hi>and other delights.
I am diſtreſſed for thee, my brother</hi> Chillingworth, (may his
Executrix ſay) <hi>very pleaſant haſt thou beene unto me, thy love
to me was wonderfull, paſſing the love of</hi> father, husband, bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
<hi>O how are the mighty fallen, and the weapons,</hi> nay engines
<hi>of warre periſhed! O tell it not in Gath,</hi> that he who raiſed a
battery againſt the Popes chaire, that he might <hi>place Reaſon
in the chaire in ſtead of Antichriſt,</hi> is dead and gone: <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
it not in the ſtreets of Askelon,</hi> that he who did at once
<pb facs="tcp:111525:24"/>
batter <hi>Rome,</hi> and undermine <hi>England,</hi> the Reforming Church
of <hi>England,</hi> that he might prevent a Reformation, is dead;
leſt if you publiſh it, you puzzle all the Conclave, and
put them to conſider, whether they ſhould mourne or
triumph.</p>
            <p>If any man enquire, whether he hath a <hi>Tombe-ſtone,</hi> as
well as an <hi>Elegy,</hi> let him know that we plundered an old
Friar of his <hi>Tombe-ſtone,</hi> and there is roome enough for an
<hi>Epitaph</hi> if they pleaſe to ſend one from <hi>Oxford;</hi> if not, give
us leave to ſay, we have provided a <hi>Sepulchre,</hi> and it is your
fault if you doe not provide a <hi>Monument:</hi> for as <hi>Laurentius

Queſtion.</head>
            <p>HOw ſhall I be able to prove to an Atheiſt, that there is
a God, and that the Books of the Old and New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
are the word of God?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> When Proteſtants affirme againſt Papiſts, that
Scripture is a perfect rule of Faith; their meaning is not,
<pb facs="tcp:111525:24"/>
that by Scripture all things Abſolutely may be proved, which
are to be beléeved; for it can never bée proved by Scripture
to a gain ſayer, that there is a God, or that the Book called
Scripture is the word of God—for (as he ſaith a little
before) nothing is proved true by being ſaid or written in a
Book, but only by Tradition, which is a Thing credible of
it ſelfe, <hi>chap. 1. p. 55. Sect. 8. the firſt Edition approved at
Oxford.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Doubtleſſe the Atheiſts and Papiſts will give him hearty
thanks for this anſwer, which doth preferre Tradition (which
the Atheiſt vilifies) before Scripture, which the Papiſts vili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie:
he hath pleaſed them both. The Papiſts will bee well
pleaſed to ſee this doctrine licenſed by the Proteſtants of the
Univerſity of <hi>Oxford,</hi> that Tradition is more credible then
Scripture, for Tradition is credible <hi>for it ſelfe;</hi> but the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
when it is to be proved a perfect Rule <hi>to us,</hi> is credible
<hi>only by Tradition</hi> in Mr <hi>Chillingworths</hi> conceit, pag. 96. and
where ſhall we meet with this univerſall Tradition?</p>
            <p>2. But I finde another anſwer, pag. 53. <hi>Tradition may be
helped out by naturall Reaſon.</hi> Controverſies, wherein the
Scripture it ſelfe is the ſubject of the queſtion, cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined,
ſaith Mr <hi>Chillingworth,</hi> but by <hi>Naturall</hi> Reaſon,
the only principle, beſide Scripture, which is common to
Chriſtians, cap. 2. ſect. 3. And in his marginall obſervations
on a paſſage of Mr <hi>Hookers</hi> he layes downe this as a Rule; <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall</hi>
Reaſon then built on principles common to all men, is
the <hi>laſt Reſolution,</hi> pag. 65. Nay, Reaſon is in ſome ſort <hi>Gods
word,</hi> ſee his anſwer to the Preface, pag. 21. How then (will
the Atheiſt ſay) is Reaſon credible for it ſelfe, ſince (Mr
<hi>Chillingworth</hi> ſaith) that Gods word is not credible for it
ſelfe? Surely theſe anſwers will never bring a man to divine
faith; for to rely upon Tradition, is but to rely upon <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi>
teſtimony; and ſuch as the teſtimony is, ſuch is the
faith: if the teſtimony, which is the ground of faith, be <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane,</hi>
then the faith cannot be <hi>divine.</hi> Againe, naturall Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
is not infallible, nor is it able to judge of truths which are
above Reaſon: now it is cleare, that ſupernaturall truths are
<pb facs="tcp:111525:25"/>
above naturall Reaſon. Finally, faith is not grounded upon
Reaſon, but upon Authority.</p>
            <p>He gives a third anſwer, chap. 1. pag. 36. <hi>God hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
the doctrine of the Scripture by miracles;</hi> but then
he ſaith, we have nothing to aſſure us of the truth of thoſe
miracles, but Tradition; and therefore we are not got one
ſteppe nearer faith or Heaven by that ſhift: and if he flie back
to Reaſon, then conſider what he ſaith, pag. 117. God hath
no where commanded men to beleeve all that Reaſon induceth
them to beleeve.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> But if this great point muſt be tried by Reaſon, what
Reaſon can you produce, to prove the Scripture to be the word
of God?</p>
            <p>An. <hi>There is as good reaſon for it, as there is to beléeve
other ſtories or matters of Tradition:</hi> He requires men to
yeeld juſt ſuch a <hi>kinde</hi> or <hi>degree</hi> of aſſent to the Goſpel of
Chriſt, as they yeeld to other ſtories or matters of Tradition,
chap. 1. pag. 37. for God deſires us only to beleeve the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion
as much as the premiſes deſerve, ib. ſect. 8. p. 36.
And the Chronicle of <hi>England,</hi> joyned with the generall
tradition of our acquaintance, deſerves as much credit in
Mr <hi>Chillingworths</hi> conceit, as the Goſpel of Chriſt;
for his words are theſe, chap. 2. ſect. 159. p. 116. 117. Wee
have, I beleeve, <hi>as great reaſon</hi> to beleeve there was ſuch a
man as <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth King of <hi>England,</hi> as the Jeſus
Chriſt ſuffered under <hi>Pontius Pilate.</hi> The Lord rebuke that
ſpirit of errour, which moved the great men of <hi>Oxford</hi> to
licenſe this blaſphemy! What have I no more reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
the three perſons in the holy Trinity, ſpeaking in their
<hi>glorious Goſpel</hi> to my <hi>heart</hi> and <hi>conſcience,</hi> then I have to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
<hi>Stowes Chronicle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> or the <hi>generall tradition</hi> of my owne
acquaintance, or ſome ſuch other fallible teſtimony?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> But what if I cannot be aſſured, that any part of the
Scripture is the word of God, may I be ſaved without beleeving
this weighty point?</p>
            <p>An. <hi>Yes,</hi> ſaith Mr. <hi>Chillingworth,</hi> chap. 2. ſect. 159. <hi>if a
man ſhould beléeve Chriſtian Religion wholly and entirely,
<pb facs="tcp:111525:25"/>
and live according to it, ſuch a man though he ſhould not know,
or not beléeve the Scripture to be a Rule of faith, no nor to
be the word of God; my opinion is he may be ſaved.</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Divinity indeed! what, is not this a principle of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity,
that Scripture is the word of God, and rule of faith?
and if it be, how then is it poſſible for a man to beleeve the
Chriſtian Religion wholly and entirely, and yet not beleeve
this principle? <hi>Yes, I may beléeve the Scripture as I doe
Auguſtins works,</hi> pag. 114.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> But if I am aſſured that ſome Scripture is the word
of God, how ſhall I know what books are Canonicall, and what
not?</p>
            <p>An. <hi>By univerſall Tradition.</hi> I muſt receive thoſe
books for Canonicall, of whoſe Authority there was never
any doubt or queſtion in the Church, pag. 148. I may then,
it ſeems, doubt of the Epiſtle of <hi>James,</hi> the ſecond of <hi>Peter,</hi>
the ſecond and third Epiſtles of <hi>John,</hi> the Epiſtle to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes,</hi>
the Epiſtle of <hi>Jude,</hi> the book of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> the
books of <hi>Job, Eſther, Eccleſiaſtes,</hi> &amp;c. He ſaith, he cannot in
reaſon ſo undoubtedly beleeve thoſe books to be Canonicall,
which have beene queſtioned, as thoſe which were never que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned.
At leaſt I have no warrant to damne any man—that
<hi>ſhall deny</hi> them <hi>now,</hi> having the example of Saints in
Heaven, either <hi>to juſtifie</hi> or excuſe ſuch—<hi>their deniall,</hi> chap. 2.
ſect. 38. pag. 67. Surely here is a pretty <hi>tempting</hi> excuſe for,
if not a juſtification of thoſe Libertines who queſtion theſe
books, and may upon Mr <hi>Chillingworths</hi> principles queſtion
all the reſt, if they acknowledge one of the <hi>Goſpels,</hi> that
containes as much as all the reſt; Ergo that is ſufficient,
pag. 93. 101.</p>
            <p>But if they beleeve no booke to be Canonicall, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
will not aſſent to any book of Scripture, they doe not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
a ſinne of derogation from Gods perfect and pure veracity;
for he onely gives God the lye, who denies ſome book or point
<hi>which he himſelfe knowes or beleeves to be revealed by God,</hi> chap.
3. ſect. 15, 16, 17. Now it is impoſſible that a man ſhould know
one thing to be true, and beleeve the contrary; or know it and
<pb facs="tcp:111525:26"/>
not beleeve it, ſect. 18. Whither theſe and the like principles
(which frequently occurre in his writings) tend, let the moſt
ſober and charitable men judge. The only Fundamentall Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
in Mr <hi>Chillingworths</hi> judgement, is to deny ſomething
which the party himſelfe knowes or beleeves to be revealed
by God: and therefore in his judgement none but downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
Atheiſts erre fundamentally, cap. 2. p. 135. 136. Atheiſme
then, as the Jeſuites and Arminians conceive, is the formality
of an Heretick, p. 100. for it is down-right Atheiſme for any
man to deny that to be true, which he acknowledges to be
ſpoken by the God of truth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> But if I doe beleeve the Scripture to be Gods word, is
it neceſſary to beleeve that controverſies are to be decided by that
Word?</p>
            <p>An. <hi>No,</hi> ſaith Mr <hi>Chillingworth, <hi>this is no Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
point;</hi>
               </hi> his words are full. I ſay that this <hi>poſition</hi> (Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
alone is the rule whereby they which beleeve it to bee
Gods word, are to judge all controverſies in faith) <hi>is no Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall
point,</hi> chap. 2. pag. 115. His intent is by this aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to make good a dreame of his, that ſome controverſies
in faith need not be judged or determined at all. Mr <hi>Chilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi>
pretends, that he holds the Scripture to be a perfect
rule of faith, and yet he ſaith it is not neceſſary to judge all
controverſies (and thoſe no ſmall ones, becauſe they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies)
in faith by that perfect rule. It is a perfect rule,
but we need not be ruled by it in all points of faith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> But is there then any other way to decide controverſies
which hath any colour of probability from the Scripture?</p>
            <p>An. <hi>Yes:</hi> nine or ten ſeverall meanes of agreement of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
themſelves to Mr <hi>Chillingworth</hi> upon the ſudden, (and
haply more might have beene thought on if he had had time)
and theſe that are offered, have as much probability <hi>from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
as that which Papiſts obtrude upon us. And truly he
was ſuch a <hi>ready</hi> blaſphemer, that he could vent <hi>extemporary
blaſphemies;</hi> yet ſuch as the Licentious men at <hi>Oxford</hi> appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
chap. 3. pag. 130. 131.</p>
            <p>Firſt he ſaith, <hi>we could, if we would, try it by lots,</hi> whoſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
<pb facs="tcp:111525:26"/>
is true, and whoſe falſe; for which he cites <hi>Prov.</hi> 16. 33.
It may be, this Sophiſter did caſt lots for his Religion, and it
was his hard lot to draw Popery firſt, then Arminianiſme, and
then his doctrine run lower and lower, till it came almoſt to
the very dregs of Socinianiſme.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>we could referre it to the King, Prov</hi> 16. 10. and
21. 1. Mr <hi>Chillingworth</hi> might make merry with his owne
<hi>prophane</hi> doctrine, but I admire that he ſhould dare to ſport
himſelfe with the <hi>Majeſty of Scripture,</hi> and the Majeſty of
the King: But truly I am afraid, that ſome are ſo indifferent
in point of Religion, that they are content not only to referre
it to the King, but to <hi>the Queene.</hi> It were proper for them to
vent ſuch Doctrine, who have, as the old Tradition and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbe
hath it, taken an <hi>oath</hi> to be of the <hi>Kings Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>to an Aſſembly of Chriſtians aſſembled in the name
of Chriſt, Math.</hi> 18. 20. Let them not then blame the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
for conſulting an Aſſembly of learned and pious Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
and moſt of them Miniſters of the Goſpel, aſſembled in
the name of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>to any Prieſt, Malach.</hi> 2. 7. This makes well
of the Queens ſide.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, <hi>to any Preacher of the Goſpel, Paſtour, or Doctour,
Math.</hi> 28. 20. Sure Mr <hi>Chillingworth</hi> was more independent
then they that are commonly ſo called.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, <hi>to any Biſhop or Prelate</hi> (why not then to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of <hi>Rome?</hi>) for it is written, Obey your Prelates, <hi>Heb. 13.
17.</hi> Mr <hi>Chillingworth</hi> ſince his pretended converſion was very
apt to be ſeduced by the vulgar (or Rhemiſh) tranſlation, or
ſome verſion received at Saint <hi>Omers;</hi> but this was a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
and deviſed meanes, as he ſaith in the ſame page.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly,</hi> to any particular Church of Chriſtians, ſeeing it
is a particular Church, which is called the houſe of God, a pillar
and ground of truth, 1 Tim. 3. 15. and ſeeing of any particular
Church it is written, <hi>He that heareth not the Church, let him
be unto thee an Heathen,</hi> Matth. 18. <hi>Mr</hi> Chillingworth <hi>is
ſometimes</hi> Prelaticall, <hi>and ſometimes</hi> Congregationall.</p>
            <p>Eighthly, <hi>we might referre it to any man that prayes for Gods
<pb facs="tcp:111525:27"/>
ſpirit;</hi> for it is written, every one that asketh, receives,
(this is one ſteppe beyond the Browniſts) <hi>Matth. 7. 8.
James</hi> 1. 5.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, <hi>we might referre it to the Jewes, for without all doubt
of them it is written,</hi> My ſpirit that is in thee, &amp;c. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 59. 21.
And why not to the Socinians? they have naturall reaſon, a very
competent Judge in Mr <hi>Chillingworths</hi> conceit. What wonder
is it that ſo many blaſphemies and quibbles <hi>for every quibble
upon Scripture is a blaſphemy)</hi> ſhould be licenſed by grave and
learned Profeſſours of Divinity? what if Papiſts take liberty
to blaſpheme and put the Scripture upon the rack to force it to
confeſſe what makes for their turn; muſt Proteſtants or ſuch
a one who undertakes the common Cauſe of Proteſtants
(though he was no Proteſtant) bee permitted to blaſpheme by
the Licence of an Univerſity? Repent deare Doctors, once
more repent; and I will proceed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> But how ſhall I know the true ſenſe of Scripture, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſuch variety of conceits which paſſe for Interpretations?</p>
            <p>Anſw. <hi>Here help mee Reaſon again and Implicit Faith.</hi>
For, the laſt Reſolution of my Faith in his conceit muſt be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Reaſon, page 65. 96. and ſtill he labours to prove that Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
is Judge; and he frequently jeares at <hi>Knot</hi> for accounting
it an abſurdity for every man and woman <hi>to rely upon their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>
in the interpreting of Scripture p. 98. Reaſons drawn out
of the circumſtances of the Text cannot convince me, unleſſe
I judge of them by my Reaſon; and for every man or woman
to rely on that—in the interpreting of Scripture, you ſay is
an horrible abſurdity. And p. 99. Reaſon will ſhew this to be
the meaning: yes, if we may uſe our Reaſon, <hi>and rely upon it.</hi>
Proteſtants <hi>uſe</hi> their reaſon, but Socinians <hi>rely</hi> upon their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.
And he teaches implicit faith all along his book: Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants,
ſaith he, do agree with an <hi>Implicit faith</hi> in that ſenſe of
the whole Scripture which God intended, <hi>whatſoever it was,</hi>
p 129. 130 cap. 5. ſect. 3. a ready way to tempt men to beleeve
very little concerning the ſenſe of Scripture: for, men will be
apt to ſay, that the ſenſe of this and the other place of Scripture
is not plainly and fully revealed, and Mr <hi>Chillingworth</hi> doth not
<pb facs="tcp:111525:27"/>
require any thing to be beleeved with an explicit faith which
is not plainly and undoubtedly delivered in Scripture. My rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
(ſaith he) is convincing and demonſtrative, becauſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is neceſſary to be beleeved, but what is plainly revealed,
p. 92. But nothing in his judgement is plainly revealed about
any point which is called in queſtion, <hi>if there be a ſeeming con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict</hi>
of Scripture with Scripture, Reaſon with Reaſon, Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
with Authority; in ſuch a caſe he cannot well underſtand
how it can be truly ſayd, that God hath manifeſtly revealed the
truth on either ſide, chap. 3. ſect. 9. p. 136. 137. Well, but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
that the appearances on my ſide are anſwerable, and grant
that Scripture, Reaſon, Authority, are all againſt me, becauſe
on the other ſide; yet conſider the ſtrange power of <hi>Education</hi>
and <hi>Prejudices</hi> inſtilled by it, and what <hi>Paſſions</hi> I am ſubject
to, and then my errour is unavoydable, and therfore excuſable;
for though the truth is <hi>in it ſelfe</hi> revealed plainly enough, yet to
<hi>ſuch a one</hi> as I am, <hi>prepoſſeſt</hi> with contrary opinions, the truth
in that point is not plainly revealed, read page 137. Sure the
corruption of our Nature is as unavoydable as prejudices and
paſſions, and therefore he muſt (according to his principles)
conclude that <hi>God who knowes whereof we are made, will not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into judgement with us for thoſe things which (all things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered)
were unavoydable;</hi> they are his own words page 137.
Nay, beſides <hi>education, prejudices, and paſſions, inadvertence</hi>
may in the fourth place excuſe us if we diſ-beleeve a plain Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation.
Finally, in the fift place, multitude of buiſineſſe,
diſtractions, hinderances, will excuſe us, and hinder God from
imputing our errours to us as ſinnes. In his anſwer to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
p 19. I am verily perſwaded that God will not impute er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
to them as ſinnes, who uſe ſuch a meaſure of induſtry in
finding truth, as <hi>humane prudence and ordinary diſcretion</hi> (their
abilities and opportunities, their diſtractions and hinderances,
and all other things conſidered) (he will be ſure to give liberty
enough) ſhall adviſe them unto in a matter of ſuch conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.
But certainly humane prudence and ordinary diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
will teach men to plead theſe excuſes, which he hath fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
for them, when any point of faith ſhall be preſſed upon
<pb facs="tcp:111525:28"/>
them; they will ſay, our opportunities are few, our diſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and hinderances many, our education meane, our abilities
weake, our prejudices ſtrong, our paſſions violent, our inadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
pardonable, and therefore we will content our ſelves <hi>with
a modeſt humble implicite faith;</hi> we beleeve the whole Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to be true, in that ſenſe which God intended, <hi>whatſoever
it was,</hi> but we have not time to <hi>ſearch</hi> or <hi>ability to judge what it
was:</hi> if we beleeve nothing explicitely, or to disbeleeve a clear
revelation, that revelation, though cleare in it ſelfe, is not <hi>cleare
to us,</hi> our errour (the corruption of our nature, our prejudices,
contrary opinions, with which we are already prepoſſeſt, and all
other things conſidered) is unavoidable, and therefore God
will never impute it to us as a ſinne. Whither theſe Principles
tend, let the pretended Parliament at <hi>Oxford</hi> judge.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> But are we not bound to heare what the Church will ſay
to us for our direction in weighty points?</p>
            <p>Anſ. <hi>I muſt beléeve the Church in every thing ſhe proves,
either by Scripture, Reaſon, or univerſall Tradition, be

Theſe disjunctives ſeem to imply that ſomething fundamentall
may be proved by reaſon, or univerſall Tradition, which cannot
be proved by Scripture. The Licencers may do well to declare
what that Fundamentall point is, or how many there are, if
there be more then one: I may go to Heathens, I need not go to
the Church for any thing which Reaſon teaches, the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers

            <p>He will wrangle with you if you ſay faith in Chriſt is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
propounded to Iewes, Turks, Heathens: for obſerve
that he preſently addes in the ſelfe ſame page, That may be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
declared to one (all things conſidered) which (all things
conſidered) to another is not ſufficiently declared, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
that may be Fundamentall and neceſſary to one, which
to another is not ſo. <hi>In his conceit then it is not neceſſary for ſome
mens ſalvation, that they ſhould beleeve in Chriſt.</hi> And it hath
beene formerly obſerved, that ſome men (as he conceived<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>)
might be made faithfull men without neceſſity of Church or
Scripture. Finally, in the 133 page he ſaith expreſly, that
<hi>Cornelius</hi> was but a meete Gentile, one that beleeved not in
Chriſt, and knew not <hi>but men</hi> might <hi>be worſhipped;</hi> and yet we
are aſſured, that his prayers and almes, even whilſt he was <hi>in
that eſtate,</hi> were accepted. Ergo in his judgement a <hi>meere
Heathen</hi> and an <hi>Idolater</hi> may have acceſſe to God in prayer,
and be accepted without the mediation of our only Mediator
the <hi>Lord Ieſus, God bleſſed for ever.</hi> But the truth is, <hi>Cornelius</hi>
was a Proſelyte, inſtructed in the Iewiſh Religion, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved
in the Meſſiah, and that faith was ſufficient for his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance,
before the Goſpel of Chriſt was preached unto him.
The prayers and almes of idolatrous Heathens (who know not
but they may worſhip men) cannot be accepted without faith
in Chriſt: nor do their prayers and almes pleaſe God ſo well,
as that for them or by them they ſhould <hi>be promoted to a higher
degree of knowledge, the knowledge of Chriſt, that ſo they may
be ſaved by Chriſt:</hi> for what is this, but to deſerve a Saviour,
which is <hi>meritum de congruo</hi> at leaſt? nay, let the <hi>Licenſers</hi>
conſider, <hi>whether to deſerve Chriſt, be not more then to deſerve
Heaven.</hi> Moreover, he is much miſtaken, when he ſaith, that
they who never heard of Chriſt, may ſeek God as to pleaſe him,
<pb facs="tcp:111525:30"/>
and that they ſhall be rewarded for their ſeeking of him with
the knowledge of the Goſpell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or ſaith in Chriſt; ſor he who
doth not ſeek God in and by Chriſt our only Mediatour, doth
not come to God, but runs quite beſide him: to ſuch a carnall
ſeeking<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God never yet promiſed ſuch a ſpirituall reward. Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that of the Apoſtle <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 30, 31, 32, 33. and the next chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
the ſecond and third verſes. That text <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11. 6. ſhould
be compared with, and expounded by <hi>Iohn</hi> 14. 6. and then it
will be evident that no man can ſeek ſo as to finde him, or come
to him after an acceptable manner, unleſſe he ſeek God in, and
come to him by Ieſus Chriſt, who is the <hi>way,</hi> the <hi>truth,</hi> and
the <hi>life,</hi> the true way to eternall life. I haſten to the next

            <p>

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Repentance of ſinne, and obedience to Chriſt; for
God is a puniſher of them that obſtinately offend him; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
repentance of ſinne is neceſſary, and Ieſus Chriſt is the
ſonne of God and Saviour of the world, by obedience to whom
men muſt look to be ſaved, <hi>p. 101. Mark, he doth not ſay, <hi>by
whoſe obedience</hi> men muſt be juſtified, and yet this is the faireſt
confeſſion that I can meet with: I read often of our obedience
to Chriſt, but I never read any thing yet in Mr <hi>Chillingworths</hi>
book, of <hi>Chriſts obedience imputed to us; now it is the imputation
of Chriſts obedience to us, and Gods free pardon of our diſobedience,
which make the covenant appeare to be a covenant of grace.</hi>

committed.</hi> Anſwer to the Preface <hi>p.</hi> 20. If we have beene
betrayed into, or kept in errour by any ſin of our will, if that
errour be diſcovered, there muſt be a <hi>particular and explicite</hi>
repentance of that errour; if it be not diſcovered, then a <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
and implicite repentance</hi> for all ſinnes knowne and unknown
doth ſuffice, <hi>Ib. p.</hi> 21. Obſerve that he ſaith nothing of the <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
of ſinne, or the forſaking of</hi> ſinne, in which the <hi>life</hi> and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of repentance doth conſiſt. <hi>A man may live and die in his

<pb facs="tcp:111525:30"/>
ſaith he, who die in wilfull errours <hi>without repentance;</hi> but what
<hi>if they die in thir errours with repentance?</hi> Anſwer to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
<hi>p.</hi> 20. That is a contradiction, ſaith the Ieſuit, and he ſaith
true; but it appeares by that ſpeech, that Maſter <hi>Chillingworth</hi>
conceived <hi>that an univerſall ſorrow for ſinne without any hatred
of, or turning from ſinne, was ſaving repentance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> What other condition is required in the Covenant between
God and man in Christ?</p>
            <p>Anſw. <hi>Sincere obedience.</hi> Anſwer to the Preface, <hi>p.</hi> 18. This
indeed is the prime condition he meanes, when he ſaith, <hi>p. 134.
That to beleeve in Chriſt, is to expect remiſsion of ſinnes from
Christ upon the conditions he requires.</hi> This is pure <hi>Socinianiſme,</hi>
to beleeve that we ſhall be pardoned upon our obedience, or as
the <hi>Socinians</hi> expreſſe it, and juſtified (according to the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant)
by <hi>our owne obedience;</hi> not as we ſay, <hi>by the obedience of
Chriſt,</hi> and freely pardoned <hi>for the al ſufficient ſatisfaction of
Chriſt, made in our ſtead, and put upon our account.</hi> Beſides, if a
man neglect never ſo many duties, live in never-ſo many errors,
and commit never ſo many groſſe ſinnes, he conceives that an
Implicite Faith and a generall Repentance of all ſinnes knowne
and unknowne, are ſufficient Antidotes, and his Obedience
ſhall paſſe for ſincere Obedience; as you may clearly ſee in
thoſe places which have beene already alleadged. If a man be
not convinced that Chriſt is God, (by his principles) an Impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit
Faith and generall Repentance will ſerve the turne, though
that truth hath beene ſufficiently propounded to him, and it is
meerly his own fault that he is not convinced, for in his conceit
as long as this man remains (as he ſaith) unconvinced (but as we
ſay, obſtinate) ſo long he doth not derogate any thing from
Gods veracity or truth. His words are theſe. But if the propoſall
be only ſo ſufficient, not, that the party (to whom it is made) is
convinced, but only that he <hi>ſhould,</hi> &amp; <hi>but for his own fault would</hi>
have beene convinced of the divine verity of the doctrine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed.
The crime then is not ſo great, <hi>for the beliefe of Gods
veracity may well conſiſt with ſuch an errour.</hi> Yet a fault I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
it is, and without Repentance, damnable, if all circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
conſidered (that is, mens paſſions, hindrances, &amp;c. conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
<pb facs="tcp:111525:31"/>
as above ſaid) the propoſall be ſufficient, <hi>p.</hi> 18. of his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
to the Preface. Now what he meanes by repentance hath
beene ſhewen, a generall ſorrow for all ſinnes knowne and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne;
<hi>ſuch a repentance as will conſiſt with a mans obſtinate
deniall of a truth, for he may die in this errour with Maſter</hi> Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingworths
<hi>repentance, and neither the errour nor the obstinancie
ſhall be imputed to him, becauſe he is ſorry for he knowes not
what,</hi> and remained unconvinced of his errour, though it was
meerly his owne fault that he was not convinced. This is a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
way to ſave <hi>Iewes, Turkes, Socinians, Papiſts Infidels, and all;</hi>
for he doth meerly retaine the names of faith, repentance, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
obedience, without the ſubſtance, life, and power of them.
The Faith he talkes of, leaves the will at liberty: he ſtarts at the
Apoſtles phraſe, <hi>the obedience of faith.</hi> You (ſaith he to <hi>Knot)</hi>
ſay there is ſome <hi>merit</hi> in faith, we ſome obedience in it, which
can <hi>hardly have place where there is no poſsibility of diſobedience,</hi>
as there is not, where the underſtanding doth all, and the will
nothing, <hi>p.</hi> 329. Sure I am, the Devill hath ſuch a ſaith, <hi>an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
without obedience;</hi> his faith is no faith, becauſe grounded
meerly upon probabilities; he only ſaith that the precepts of
Chriſtianity are moſt likely to come from God, <hi>p. 36. chap.</hi> 1.
but the Spirit of God being implored by devout and humble
prayer, and ſincere obedience, may and will by degrees ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
his ſervants to an higher certainty, <hi>p.</hi> 36. 37. But this cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
is a reward given to beleevers; ſo then men are beleevers
before the Spirit gives them any certainty that the Chriſtian
religion did proceed from the fountaine of goodneſſe: Now he
who only beleeves the Chriſtian religion of all other religions
to <hi>be moſt likely</hi> to be true, is not <hi>very likely</hi> to implore the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<hi>very earneſtly</hi> either by prayer or obedience; for who will
obey the precepts of Chriſtianity till he be aſſured that they
and the promiſes are divine? But ſaith Maſter <hi>Chillingworth,</hi>
men may talke their pleaſure of an abſolute and moſt infallible
certainty, but did they generally beleeve that obedience to
Chriſt were the only way (marke that, the onely way) to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
and eternall felicity, <hi>but as firmly and undoubtedly</hi> as that
there is ſuch a City as <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> nay but as much <hi>as Caeſars
<pb facs="tcp:111525:31"/>
Commentaries, or the Hiſtory of Saluſt;</hi> I beleeve the lives of
moſt men, both Papiſts and Proteſtants would be better then
they are, <hi>chap. 6. pag.</hi> 327. Sure Chriſts obedience for us is
the way to happineſſe, therefore our obedience is not the only
way. 2. It is certaine that all true Proteſtants do beleeve the
Goſpel more firmly then <hi>(Caeſars Commentaries</hi> or <hi>Saluſt)</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
Hiſtories. 3. Such a Faith as this will not implore the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
by devout and humble prayer, or by ſincere obedience. 4. I
appeale to all indifferent men what kind of obedience is like to
ſpring from an implicite faith in unſanctified reaſon; a faith
that is a bare aſſent without obedience, the faith of Devils, not
the faith of Chriſtians. 5. The repentance of obſtinate men,
(I meane in <hi>ſenſu compoſito,</hi> as Maſter <hi>Chillingworth</hi> means) a
generall ſorrow which he cals repentance (that is, humiliation
without reformation) repentance of ſinnes which I love and
live in and damnable errours which I die in, is not that repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
from dead works which Chriſt requires; ſure Hereſie in
the language of the Apoſtle is a work of the fleſh, and therefore
as dead a work as any other; we may then ſafely conclude <hi>(that
an implicite faith in unſanctified reaſon or fallible tradition,</hi> and
a generall ſorrow for I know not what ſinnes and errors (though
groſſe enough for to be known) ſuch ſinnes and errours as the
party doth love, live, and die in, and never ſo much as confeſſe
to be ſinnes or errours, becauſe he is ſo obſtinate that he will not
be convinced of them) I ſay, ſafely conclude, that this <hi>faith and
this ſorrow are both unchriſtian, if not Antichriſtian.</hi> He that hath
an <hi>implicite faith</hi> in his <hi>owne unſanctified</hi> reaſon makes himſelfe
<hi>a Pope.</hi> Sanctified reaſon ſees but in part, and therefore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanctified
reaſon is ſpiritually blind, it cannot ſee any thing
which is ſpiritually diſcerned. Beſides, I feare that he concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
there was ſome merit of congruity <hi>in the lame</hi> obedience
of this <hi>blind</hi> beleever, becauſe he ſaith the <hi>ſincere obedience</hi> of
<hi>ſuch</hi> a beleever <hi>doth implore the Spirit.</hi> Now whether a man
that relies upon his owne reaſon, and his owne obedience,
in ſtead of relying upon Gods authority and Chriſts obedience,
can be ſaved by the Covenant of Grace, let all true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
judge.</p>

his works afford, but obſerve. 1. We are (ſaith he) deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to eternall happineſſe <hi>if we ſerve God;</hi> which is perfect Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,
ſhall I ſay, or Socinianiſme? here is a conditionall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree,
and the condition is works. 2. God expects our conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
I thought he had effected our converſion; if God ſtay till
we will turne off our ſelves <hi>or cooperate with his Spirit in the
firſt act of our converſion,</hi> we ſhall never be converted. Sure I
am, this Implicite faith grounded on unſanctified reaſon, and
fallible tradition, will rather <hi>reſiſt,</hi> then <hi>cooperate</hi> with<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the holy
Spirit. The Scripture tels us that we do never love God in good
earneſt till we doe beleeve Gods love to us: compare the 16.
and 19. verſes of the 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 4. And faith is not <hi>wrought in us
by our cooperation with the Spirit</hi> but by the Almighty power of
God who quickens us whom he finds dead in treſpaſſes and
ſinnes unto a lively faith; as is evident in the two firſt chapters
of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Epheſians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu</hi> Is it poſsible for a man that lives and dies a Papiſt to be
ſaved?</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:111525:32"/>
Anſ. <hi>Yes very poſſible in the iudgement of Maſter</hi> Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingworth.
1, Becauſe the Papiſts do not erre in Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals
<hi>chap. 3. Sect. 56. pag.</hi> 164. For the only and main rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
(ſaith he) why we beleeve you not to erre in Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals
is your holding the Doctrine of Faith in Chriſt and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.
The <hi>worſt</hi> ſort of Papiſts who have means to find
the Truth, but will not uſe them, may be ſaved if they die
with a generall repentance for all their ſinnes knowne and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne,
becauſe the Truths which they hold of Faith in
Chriſt, and repentance are as it were an Antidote againſt their
errours, and their negligence in ſeeking the truth. Eſpecially,
ſeeing by confeſſion of both ſides we agree in <hi>much more</hi> then
is <hi>ſimply</hi> and indiſpenſably neceſſary to ſalvation, <hi>Chap. 3. Sect.
12. pag.</hi> 133. And truly I doe beleeve if the worſt of Papiſts,
and the worſt of Proteſtants did agree in fewer things then
they doe, there would be more hope of the ſalvation of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> What is the beſt way to bring Papiſts and Proteſtants into
one communion?</p>
            <p>Anſ. <hi>The framing and propoſing of a Liturgy which both
ſides hold lawfull.</hi> p. 132. This was perchance the great ſtrata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem
aimed at in the framing of that Liturgy which was ſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Scotland;</hi> and this is a point which deſerves the conſideration
of the pretended Parliament or Aſſembly at <hi>Oxford.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> Is the Spirit abſolutely promiſed to the ſucceſsion of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops?</p>
            <p>Anſw. <hi>No:</hi> for many of them have beene notoriouſly and
confeſſedly wicked men, men of the world: whereas this Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
is the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he ſeeth him not, neither knowes him, <hi>p.</hi> 146, 147.
Whether this be not as true of ſome Popiſh Prelats in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi>
as of the Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> let the learned determine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> What if a Church maintaine an errour contrary to Gods
Revelation knowne by that Church to be a divine Revelation?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> The Church that doth ſo is no longer a Church. <hi>p.
137.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> Doth not Master <hi>Chillingworth</hi> ſometimes contradict
<pb facs="tcp:111525:33"/>
himſelfe, and call the Roman Church the Catholique Church.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> He ſeemes to do ſo, <hi>p.</hi> 132. His words are theſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <hi>We beléeve the Catholique Church cannot periſh, yet that ſhe
may, and did erre in points not Fundamentall; and that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtan<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

were obliged to forſake theſe errors of her Church,</hi> as
they did, <hi>though not the Church for the errours,</hi> for that they
did not, <hi>but continued ſtill members of the Church.</hi> Obſerve
that the queſtion is about forſaking the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and
he talkes of the Catholique Church. 1. The Catholique
Church did not erre with the <hi>Roman;</hi> the Greek Church did
forſake the errours of the <hi>Roman.</hi> 2. Thoſe Proteſtants who
did proteſt againſt the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> were a conſiderable
part of the Catholique Church. 3. Thoſe Proteſtants did
not continue members of the Roman Church but did renounce
her communion, becauſe of her errours. 4. His diſtinction
which followes betweene the Catholique and Roman Church
makes his former obſervations non-ſence at leaſt. 5. He ſaith
they ſeparated from the Roman Church only in things which
they conceived ſuperſtitious or impious—and (he ſaith)
they were obliged to doe this under paine of damnation. Not
(ſaith he) as if it were damnable to hold an errour not damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<hi>p.</hi> 132. Did thoſe Proteſtants rightly conceive the practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of <hi>Rome</hi> to be ſuperſtitious and impious, or did they not? if
they did conceive aright, then ſuperſtion and impiety are in
Maſter <hi>Chillingworths</hi> judgement not damnable; if they did
conceive amiſſe, why doth Maſter <hi>Chillingworth</hi> juſtifie our
ſeparation from the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> Sure Maſter <hi>Chilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi>
was no fit man to maintaine the common cauſe of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants
againſt Papiſts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> May not a man bee damned by maintaining errours
which are not in themſelves damnable?</p>
            <p>Anſ. <hi>Yes, becauſe it is damnable outwardly to profeſſe and
maintaine, and ioyne with others in the practiſe of that which
inwardly we do not hold: for this is</hi> (as he confeſſes) <hi>damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
diſſimulation and hypocriſie,</hi> p. 132. Men may do well to
take notice, that Mr <hi>Chillingworth</hi> doth account ſomething
damnable; and I note this the rather at this time, becauſe
<pb facs="tcp:111525:33"/>
men are ſo apt to profeſſe one thing in one place, and another
thing in another in theſe dayes of liberty, and to joyne with
others in the practiſe of that which they inwardly diſlike. Yet
Mr <hi>Chillingworth</hi> ſaith, that if in him alone there ſhould have
met a confluence of all the errours which all the Proteſtants
in the world have fell into out of humane frailty, he would not
be ſo much afraid of them all, as to ask pardon for them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
to ask pardon for them, were to imply, that God is angry
for them, Anſw. to the Preface p. 19.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> May a man goe conſtantly to Maſſe, and be ſaved?</p>
            <p>Anſ. <hi>Yes, if he bée devout at it</hi> (for that he meanes by a
godly Lay-man) <hi>if he bée ſtrongly perſwaded that there is no
impiety or ſuperſtition in the uſe of the Latine ſervice,</hi> Anſw.
to the Preface p. 9. ſect. 7. It ſeems there is no fault in the
Maſſe, but that it is in Latine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> What profit might be gained by the Maſſe-book if it were
in Engliſh?</p>
            <p>Anſ. <hi>Much devotion, inſtruction, edification, ſalvation,</hi>
in the place forecited. Was not this a ſtout Champion, choſen
by Canterbury on purpoſe, not to <hi>confute,</hi> but <hi>harden</hi> Papiſts,
and <hi>ſeduce</hi> Proteſtants.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> What are the cauſes of errour?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Negligence in ſéeking truth, unwillingneſſe to find it,
pride, obſtinacy, a politique deſire that that Religion ſhould be
true, which ſutes beſt with my ends, feare of mens ill opinion,
or any other worldly feare or worldly hope, theſe ſeven betray
men to, and kéepe men in damnable errours, <hi>p. 158. It is one
of the moſt honeſt paſſages in his book. Brethren let us beware
of theſe motives.</hi>

abrogating Lawes, made to maintaine common liberty; for
he may fruſtrate their intent, and compaſſe his own deſign as
well, if he can get the power and authority to interpret them
as he pleaſes, and to adde to them what he pleaſes, and to have
his interpretations and additions ſtand for lawes; if he can
rule his people by his Laws, and his Laws by his Lawyers,
<hi>p. 51. cap. 2. I think our Iudges followed his directions in the

my reaſons to the King or Common-wealth in a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
as Sir</hi> Thomas Moore <hi>did without committing any
fault,</hi> p. 97 Why then are men ſo much blam'd for profeſſing their
judgement againſt ſome things which ſeeme to be eſtabliſhed
by Law, and repreſenting their reaſons to the Parliament? and
why did not Maſter <hi>Chillingworth</hi> yeeld externall obedience
to the Common-wealth of <hi>England</hi> in this Parliament? for

               <hi>Qu.</hi> May not a Court which pretends not to be infallible, be

Now Reader judge Maſter <hi>Chillingworths</hi> workes, my
