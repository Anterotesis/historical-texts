         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Scotch Counsellor, communicating his advice to his brethren in ENGLAND.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Beloved in the Lord,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE great comfort and content that we have received each from other these many yeares, by the intercourse of letters, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been of late detarded, did beget in me a kind of jealousie, that either your love unto me was grown cold, or your zeal un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the cause of God much abated; or else I suppose you could not so long have kept pen from paper: But I having now at last (through my importunity) exhausted as it were a letter from you, I find as much alteration in you as my former jealousie deemed, which hath filled me with great discontent, especially when I find you minded to dissert the cause of God, and flye for your own safety: And that for these reasons:
<list>
                  <item>1. In regard of the Distractions amongst you.</item>
                  <item>2. To preserve your Estate.</item>
                  <item>3. In regard of inability to help.</item>
                  <item>4. Feare of the enemies great power.</item>
                  <item>5. Vnlikelihood of Reformation.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Surely these reasons arise from your own conceit, being suggested by the spirit of Error; the invalidity whereof I shall labour to shew you by the evidence of the truth of Gods word. But before I come to your reasons, I shall speak some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing concerning your flying. This counsell arising from your selfe, may cause the Lord so to forsake and flie from you,
<pb facs="tcp:112355:2"/>
that you may <hi>eate of the fruit of your own way, and be filled with your own devices, Pro.</hi> 1. 31. For <hi>there is a way that seemeth right unto men, but the issues thereof are death, Pro.</hi> 14. 12. You thinke to flye for safety from the Church of God now in distresse, and so strip your selfe naked of Gods protection, and lay your self open to all dangers. But if you will flie, <hi>Fly unto the Lord, for with him alone thero is safety, Prov.</hi> 18. 10. and put no <hi>confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> in the world, nor in any worldly thing, no not <hi>in Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Psalm.</hi> 118. 9. It is a signe you never had love to, nor found comfort in the Church your mother, when you sever your selfe from the rest of her children, (your brethren and sisters) leaving them to undergoe what danger you feare; and not purposing (if misery come upon them) to yeeld them any help or comfort at all. O doe not so, but remember what a bitter curse was pronounced against the inhabitants of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rez,</hi> because <hi>they came not forth willingly to help the Lord against the mighty.</hi> What a curse then think you would have belonged unto them, if they had fled from their help as you resolve to doe? Recant then (I beseech you) this your wicked error, &amp; give no such evill example unto others: For if you may flie, another also may, and so two, ten, an hundred, a thousand, yea all as well as you, and so leave the Lords Vineyard to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed by the wild Boares of the Forrest without hope of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery.</p>
            <p>The Idolatrous Papists herein out-strip you in their blind zeal for Antichrist: They are so farre from flying, that they joyn themselves in association, holding and flocking together like so many swarms of Locusts out of the bottomlesse pit, not onely in our own countrey, but come also from forraigne Nations, and joyn hand in hand with them to work wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, endeavouring by all possible meanes againe to establish their abominable idolatry in this Kingdome. O let in never
<pb facs="tcp:112355:3"/>
be heard in <hi>England,</hi> nor published in our gates in <hi>Scotland,</hi> that this cursed brood of Antichrist should be more zealous for the Pope and the Divell, then the children of God should be for Christ and his Church. And so I come from your flying to your first Reason, which is,</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The great Distractions amongst you.</head>
               <p>Alas! This should be no reason to make you faint in your way to <hi>Sion.</hi> It is an ordinary thing to see distractions both in Kingdomes, Churches, Families, yea, in all Societies, the envious Man is alwayes so ready to sow the Tares of dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion among the people of God, though never so much bent to peace, knowing that a Kingdome once divided, is halfe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome, and cannot long stand in safety. What great distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and amazement was there in the Kingdome of <hi>Iudah</hi> in the dayes of good King <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> with the threatning of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacharib,</hi> and the reviling of <hi>Rabshakeh,</hi> yet we read not that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he or any of his good subjects fled to any but the Lord, who gave him victory over his enemies, and stablished his Kingdom in peace, wherein he rejoyced, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 20. 19. The Churches of God were not free from trouble and distractions even in the Apostles times, as you may read in the <hi>Acts,</hi> chap. 15. yet it discouraged not the Apostles from executing their offices, and afterwards God gave peace unto the Churches. Great distraction was in the family of good <hi>Iacob,</hi> when he supposed <hi>Ioseph</hi> had been torn in peaces with wild beasts: and when his Sonne <hi>Benjamin</hi> was left behind in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so when <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi</hi> had massacred the <hi>Shechemites, Gen.</hi> 24. None of Gods people are free from troubles and distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions: For <hi>man is born to trouble as the sparks flye upward, Iob.</hi> 5. 7. Let not troubles then dishearten you, but walk before the Lord and be upright, and he shall let you see your desire upon your enemies.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:112355:3"/>Another reason you alledge, which is this, The preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your estate. Here you shew your selfe to be of the mind of <hi>Demas,</hi> to love the present world more than the children of God, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 10. Oh farre be this from you! How is it that I heare such a thing of you? If I had not had it under your hand and seale, I should not have given credit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. Marke how the holy Ghost teacheth you a way to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve your estate, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3. 9, 10. <hi>Honour the Lord with thy riches, and with the first fruits of thine increase: So shall thy barnes bee filled with plenty, and thy presses shall burst forth with new wine.</hi> Our Saviour Christ also saith, that <hi>whosoever shall give but a cup of cold water to a Prophet, shall not lose his reward, Matth.</hi> 10. 41, 42. And he that <hi>casteth his bread upon the waters</hi> [that is, upon the afflicted] <hi>after many dayes he shall finde it, Eccles</hi> 11. 1.</p>
               <p>Me thinkes these pretious promises, and many more which I could here set downe, should excite you not onely to be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall in parting with your substance to the reliefe of the poor Church of God, now in great distresse, but even to give your life for the same, as our Saviour Christ hath done before you, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 25, 26, 27, 29. Doe but consider how many of your deare brethren in the kingdome of England have beene so far from preferring their worldly treasure before the good of Gods Church, that they have not onely liberally contributed thereto, but even sacrified their lives in the cause against the enemies thereof, whose memory shall bee recorded with the just, when the name of those that disert the same shall infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously perish in oblivion.</p>
               <p>Consider againe, I pray you, the pestilent sect of Papisticall Malignants, who spare no cost they possibly can procure ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by begging, borrowing, selling, pawning, morgaging, fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, stealing, oppressing, and all to re-edifie the Synagogue of Satan and Antichrist againe in this Kingdome. This gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb facs="tcp:112355:4"/>
of Vipers shall rise up in judgement against all those that come not forth to helpe the Lord against the mighty. And so I come to your third reason, which is your inability to help.</p>
               <p>To which I answer, The helpe that is required in such a case as this, is fourefold, <hi>viz.</hi> either in body, in purse, in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell, or in prayer: and though I nominate prayer last, yet is it to be joyned with the first, and also with all the rest; for no action can be well performed without it. But grant that you are to be excused for the first, in regard of age and other infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities attending thereon: yet for the second you can have no such pretence to excuse your selfe, God having blessed you with abundance to doe good, either in this or any other kind, if your heart be answerable thereto. And therefore remember <hi>Salomons</hi> caution, <hi>Prov.</hi> 24. 25. <hi>He that spareth more then is meet, shall surely come to poverty.</hi> So then if you extend not your li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality in this busines for the publick good of Gods Church, you spare more than is meet, and God is able to send a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand crosses upon you to diminish that which you so carefully keepe.</p>
               <p>And if you be not able in body nor willing in your meanes, yet be not deficient by good counsell to provoke and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage others, and joyne with the Church in hearty and unfained prayer, and you shall see God will send as strange a deliverance unto the Church, as he did unto <hi>Peter</hi> at the prayers of the Church: of which admirable deliverance you may reade at large in the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apostles, chap. 12.</p>
               <p>Your fourth reason is the potency of the enemy. O let not this discourage you: For though their power bee never so great, yet the power of God is greater: and if he <hi>be on our side,</hi> [as undoubtedly he is] <hi>what need we feare what power is against us? Rom.</hi> 8. 31. And although they say in the pride of their hearts as once the AEgyptians did, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15. 9. <hi>I will pursue, I</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:112355:4"/>
                  <hi>will overtake, I will divide the spoile, my lust shall be satisfied upon them, I will draw my sword, my hand shall destroy them.</hi> Mark what followeth, the Lord did but <hi>blow with his winde, and the Sea co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered them, and they sanke as lead in the mighty waters.</hi> And therefore I say unto you as <hi>Moses</hi> said to the children of Israel, <hi>Feare not, stand still, and see the salvatian of the Lord, Exod.</hi> 14. 13. For of this you may be sure, the more they prevaile, and the stronger they grow, the more they exalt themselves in the pride of their hearts, to the filling up of the measure of their iniquities, and the sooner becomming the objects of Gods wrath in their sudden destruction. For then <hi>the Lord shall speak to them in his anger, and vex them in his sore displeasure.</hi> And their <hi>lofty looks shall be humbled, and their haughtinesse bowed down, Isai.</hi> 2. 11. And <hi>as a whirl wind passeth away, so shall they be no more, but the righteous shall bee an everlasting foundation, Pro.</hi> 10. 25.</p>
               <p>And as they are by their pride exalted to their destruction, so are the people and children of God by suffering perfecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, affliction and oppression under them, fitted for mercy and deliverance: for when the afflicted cry unto the Lord, <hi>he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livereth them out of all their distresses,</hi> as you may comfortably reed in <hi>Psal.</hi> 107. Be therefore faithfull and obedient, and you shall have cause (in your happy deliverance) with holy <hi>David,</hi> to say, <hi>Other men would praise the Lord for his goodnes, and for his wonderfull works to the sons of men.</hi> Feare not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their mightie power, nor their cruell oppression, <hi>For the rod of the wicked shal not rest upon the lot of the righteous:</hi> but God shall send <hi>peace on Israel.</hi> And so I come to your last Reason, which is, <hi>Vnlikelihood of Reformation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When it is most unlikely with man, yea when it seems im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible, then is it most likely and possible with God. I will give you two instances herein. In the second of the <hi>Kings</hi> and

seventh chapter, when the famine was great in <hi>Samaria,</hi> and the Prophet prophesying of the great plenty that should en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue the next day, that the Lord on whole hand the King lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, thought it impossible although the windows of Heaven should be opened; yet it came to passe according to the words of the Prophet, and he for his incredulity was not permitted to taste thereof. Therefore trust you in the Lord alwayes: for with him unlikelihood is likely, and impossibilities are possible.</p>
               <p>Another instance almost yet in the memory of some men living, <hi>viz.</hi> after the death of that hopefull young King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the sixth, when Queene <hi>Mary</hi> got the Crowne, and had established Popery in your Kingdome of England, there was then little likelihood of Reformation; but when she had streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened her selfe by marrying with a Popish Prince, there was then far lesse: yet here was some hope left, that she might have died without issue. But when she had conceived with childe, then there was no hope left at all. And yet even then was the Churches deliverances neerest at hand, when the Lord turned the storme of Antichristian fury into a sweet and delectable calme of grace and mercy, till now of late some of that vipe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous brood are againe sprung up to disturbe our peace. But be you faithfull, and continue constant in all obedience, and you shall see that God will yet againe build up the walls of Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, and repaire all her breaches. And thus I conclude with the Apostle <hi>Iohn</hi> in his 2. Epistle and 12. verse, <hi>Having many things to write unto you, I will not write with paper and inke, but hope to come unto you, and speake face to face, that our joy may be full.</hi>
