            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Sin above all things flee, and never cease,</l>

            <l>Yea now the Soul that with his God doth dwell,</l>

IN A
STORM:
Made in a Stormy Iourney, <date>Septemb. 1672.</date>
            </head>
            <l>IN rough foul Ways, my Mind is smooth and clear;</l>
            <l>When the Winds roar, then do I loudest Sing:</l>
            <l>When the Sky low'rs, Smiles in my Looks appear:</l>
            <l>Clouds weeping Rain, no Tear from me can wring.</l>
            <l>What is it can disturb that inward Peace,</l>
            <l>Which from disturbances receives increase?</l>
            <l>This Wisdom, and this Courage, sometimes I</l>
            <l>Can in my little Stormy Journies use:</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:60146:41"/>
In th' Storms of Life, there's much more reason why</l>
            <l>The same brave Resolution I should chuse.</l>
            <l>Life is a Journey full of Troubles; these,</l>
            <l>Wisdom may turn into Advantages.</l>
            <l>Do I grow poor? I'le more enrich my Mind,</l>
            <l>Am I defam'd? I'le make my Virtue shine</l>
            <l>More brightly through those Mists; are Friends unkind?</l>
            <l>God shall be dearer. Doth my Health decline?</l>
            <l>My Soul to Heaven shall thrive; when Death shall give</l>
            <l>The mortal Wound, then shall I truly live.</l>
            <l>Thus the great <hi>Hercules,</hi> from <hi>Iuno</hi>'s spite</l>
            <l>Favours receiv'd, this made his fame encrease;</l>
            <l>First Toils and Dangers gave him first Delight</l>
            <l>And Glory; thus the martial Man is Peace;</l>
            <l>Not to bare chance, and quiet times, would owe,</l>
            <l>But to the Valour which subdues his Foe.</l>

O daring conqu'ring Virtue 'tis, we prize,</l>
            <l>As this claims Glory as its just desert:</l>
            <l>Shelves, Sands, and Tempests are the Exercise</l>
            <l>And Honour of the skilful Pilots Art.</l>
            <l>Who boasts a Virtue that was never tri'd,</l>
            <l>Is a stout Seaman by a Fire-side.</l>
            <l>Great Praise we to our wise Creator owe,</l>
            <l>Who tho he hath not (which he eas'ly could)</l>
            <l>Made all things sweet and smooth; to make them so,</l>
            <l>Gives us the pow'r; all Earth he made not Gold;</l>
            <l>But gives th' Elixir which can do as much,</l>
            <l>Turning course Stones to pure Gold, by its touch.</l>

            <l>And what supports them, when thus weighty grown,</l>

betwixt Lancashire and Kendale;
<date>Sept. 18.â€”80.</date>
            </head>
            <l>THis day in Riding through a Town,</l>
            <l>Upon the Cross I saw a Crown;</l>
            <l>Which straightway brought unto my mind</l>
            <l>What we in Holy Writ do find;</l>
            <l>That Christ did first his Cross sustain,</l>

            <l>By Patience and Obedience, he</l>
            <l>To Glory went, and so must we:</l>
            <l>But since thy Grace alone doth send</l>

            <l>Such measures of this Grace impart,</l>

            <l>This gives my mind some recompence</l>

            <head>An account of my Life in the North.
Bene qui latuit bene vixit.</head>
            <l>SInce you, dear friend, wonder how here I live,</l>
            <l>This homely Verse a brief account shall give;</l>
            <l>I live, if not in pleasure, yet at case,</l>
            <l>Not in loud laughters, but in silent peace;</l>
            <l>And tho I rarely meet with merriment,</l>
            <l>I more a stranger am to discontent:</l>
            <l>Here's no excess, nor are things needful scant;</l>
            <l>I seldom feast, but yet I never want.</l>
            <l>No dainties here to luxury invite,</l>
            <l>Our food serves well the sober appetite,</l>
            <l>Which need not be with poignant Sawces drest,</l>
            <l>Our healthful Hunger of all Sawce is best.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:60146:49"/>
Doctors we have none, nor much need them here;</l>
            <l>The Doctors we more than Diseases fear:</l>
            <l>For Country-folks think they sell death to dear.</l>
            <l>Altho I lie not on a rich Down-bed,</l>
            <l>Yet do sweet sleeps refresh my weary head.</l>
            <l>No Walks or Gardens here, but yet the Field</l>
            <l>And fragrant Meadows equal pleasures yield:</l>
            <l>No Lutes or Viols entertain my ear,</l>
            <l>But more melodious Birds I daily hear.</l>
            <l>Riches I have not, nor do riches need,</l>
            <l>Whilst here at easy rates we clothe and feed.</l>
            <l>I have no Servants whom I may command,</l>
            <l>Nor have I work that needs a Servants hand.</l>
            <l>I am not high enough to envied be,</l>
            <l>Nor do I one whom I should envy, see;</l>
            <l>Here's no applause to make me proud or vain,</l>
            <l>Nor do I meet with censures or disdain;</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:60146:50"/>
My people, if they are not wise and great,</l>
            <l>Are not untractable through self-conceit;</l>
            <l>No factious, giddy heads that make a Schism</l>
            <l>For fear of <hi>Popery</hi> or <hi>Arminianism:</hi>
            </l>
            <l>No sawey, arrogant controllers, such</l>
            <l>That cry, This is too little, this too much:</l>
            <l>No such vile wretches who their Preacher hate</l>
            <l>'Cause he reproves sin at too smart a rate:</l>
            <l>Wherefore I envy not flocks of more wealth,</l>
            <l>Which give more trouble whilst they have less health.</l>
            <l>If of Companions I have no great store,</l>
            <l>With my own mind I may converse the more;</l>
            <l>And from my old Friends tho I am confin'd,</l>
            <l>Letters may keep us in each others mind:</l>
            <l>Or if, whilst buried here, I lose their love,</l>
            <l>I'l fix my mind on surer things above.</l>
            <l>But need I Friends, need I Companions crave,</l>
            <l>Whilst I as many Friends as Neighbours have?</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:60146:50"/>
Or if I want the joy of bosom Friends,</l>
            <l>I 'scape the pain which still that joy attends:</l>
            <l>For whilst they live our hearts oft ake with fear;</l>
            <l>But break and bleed when of their death we hear.</l>
            <l>And if I want the comfort of a Wife,</l>
            <l>I have the pleasures of a single life;</l>
            <l>If I no Gallants here, nor Beauties see,</l>
            <l>From slavish Love and Courtship I am free:</l>
            <l>What fine things else you in the South can name,</l>
            <l>Our North can shew as good, if not the same:</l>
            <l>Ev'n as in Winter you have shorter Nights,</l>
            <l>But Summer us with longer Days requites.</l>
            <l>Thus if my want of joy makes life less sweet,</l>
            <l>Death then will seem less bitter when we meet.</l>
            <l>But what is this Worlds Joy? 'Tis Innocence</l>
            <l>And Virtue that do truest joys dispence:</l>
            <l>If Innocence and Virtue with me dwell,</l>
            <l>They'l make a Paradice of an Hermits Cell.</l>

            <l>On which his vain designs, if Fortune smile,</l>
            <l>Tott'ring and trembling there he stands a while;</l>
            <l>Till thence by some slight push he headlong fall,</l>
            <l>Whither he up by tedious steps did crawl.</l>
            <l>Unweildy greatness, and his dangerous height,</l>
            <l>Make him to fall with greater shame, more weight.</l>
            <l>The Man of pleasure thinks himself more wise;</l>
            <l>Gilt Earth and pop'lar air he doth despise;</l>
            <l>Delights he craves more fit for flesh and blood;</l>
            <l>Give him his grosser and more savoury mud,</l>
            <l>The pleasures of his Throat and Lust, wherein</l>
            <l>Wallowing, he drowns himself and sense of Sin;</l>
            <l>And yet his course his own designs doth thwart,</l>
            <l>Rendring the Life he's fond of, dull and short.</l>
            <l>The pleasures that he takes, his health destroy,</l>

His pleasures leave far greater pain behind;</l>
            <l>They please his senses, but torment his mind.</l>
            <l>O brutish sensless wretch! who when he might</l>
            <l>With Angels tast of pure and high delight,</l>
            <l>Will rather chuse on pois'nous dirt to dine,</l>
            <l>Will chuse in filth to lodg with Dogs and Swine.</l>
            <l>Well, let them take their choice; But how shall I</l>
            <l>This short swift moment spend before I dye?</l>
            <l>What shall I seek? What shall I wait for here?</l>
            <l>Oh! need'st thou ask what should to thee be dear,</l>
            <l>My Soul? What is it, when this World is gone,</l>
            <l>Will then thy portion be? Seek Him alone,</l>
            <l>Ev'n the Eternal God, the only rest</l>
            <l>Of Holy Souls, who in his Love are blest:</l>
            <l>His Love shall Honour be, his Grace my Treasure,</l>
            <l>His Service and his Smiles, my highest Pleasure.</l>
            <l>May I but feel I love, and know I please</l>
            <l>My God, I'l ask no greater things than these</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:60146:54"/>
No greater on this Earth. But here I'l wait</l>
            <l>That happy hour, wherein he shall translate</l>
            <l>My weary wandring Soul unto her rest,</l>
            <l>When she of Joys Divine shall be possest;</l>
            <l>Joys flowing from the blessed God, and make</l>
            <l>Blessed the Souls who do of them partake:</l>
            <l>My hope, my trust, my love on him I'l place,</l>

to Lucilius.</head>
            <l>HOld on, brave friend, in those good purposes</l>
            <l>Thy last did mention; by such means as these</l>
            <l>Live to thy self; the time that heretofore</l>
            <l>So many ways was lost, now lose no more.</l>
            <l>Our time, some's stoln (believe me what I say)</l>
            <l>Some fairlier seems withdrawn, some slips away.</l>
            <l>But of all ways none is a worse mispence,</l>
            <l>Than losing it by sloth and negligence.</l>
            <l>View with attentive eyes the most of men,</l>
            <l>With whom thou dost converse, and tell me then,</l>
            <l>Is not their life, much of it, loosely spent,</l>
            <l>Idly yet more, all on impertinent</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:60146:57"/>
And trifling things is lost? Where canst thou name</l>
            <l>A man that prizes time? that sets the same</l>
            <l>Value on Hours as Gold, who every day</l>
            <l>Perceives he's dying, whilst days wear away?</l>
            <l>'Tis a mistake to think death yet to come</l>
            <l>As all at once, which always works, and some</l>
            <l>Of it's already past: for all the breath</l>
            <l>We have, expir'd is in the hands of death.</l>
            <l>Act as thou speakest, then with all thy pow'r</l>
            <l>Lay hold on and improve each present hour.</l>
            <l>So on to morrow needst thou not depend,</l>
            <l>If thou to day hast wisdom well to spend.</l>
            <l>All things without us can't be call'd our own,</l>
            <l>But Time is truely ours, and Time alone.</l>
            <l>This fleeting slipp'ry thing doth nature give,</l>
            <l>As riches, to possess whilst here we live.</l>
            <l>Yet of this precious treasure eas'ly may</l>

Strange folly this! that things of little cost</l>

            <l>That Gratitude it self no way can find</l>
            <l>Whereby it may this gift repay in kind.</l>
            <l>But you may ask how I from day to day</l>
            <l>My time do spend? whether I my self obey</l>
            <l>My self herein? I am, I must confess,</l>
            <l>Like one who joyns care with his lavishness;</l>
            <l>Who though's expences do his bounds surmount,</l>
            <l>Yet of 's expences still he keeps account.</l>
            <l>I dare not say I lose no time, yet I</l>
            <l>So careful am, that I can tell you why,</l>

            <l>Thus I can tell how I come poor: but what?</l>
            <l>Is that man poor who hath enough? Sure not.</l>
            <l>Yet you, my friend, I rather would advise</l>

You say, in th' letter that I sent before,</l>

            <l>Which in the absence of all other can</l>

            <l>The Sword it self we praise not for the gilt</l>

            <l>From those impartially consulted, we</l>

            <l>Let the resolv'd good man his duty know,</l>

Antwerp.</head>
            <l>OH, praise the Lord, my Soul, humbly adore</l>
            <l>The riches of his Grace, which more and more</l>
            <l>To me his Handmaid hath been still exprest;</l>
            <l>Let Love and Praise be equally encreast.</l>
            <l>'Twas God, who first did Life and Reason give;</l>
            <l>By him I am preserv'd, in him I live:</l>
            <l>His Mercy, and his Pow'r did lately save</l>
            <l>My Soul from Death, my Body from the Grave.</l>
            <l>'Tis just, I to my God should wholly live,</l>
            <l>Who hath renew'd the Life he first did give.</l>
            <l>Thou that didst make me put my mind in frame;</l>
            <l>Make me thy Servant, who thy Creature am.</l>

As thou hast lately made my Body whole,</l>
            <l>So do much more for my more precious Soul.</l>
            <l>What thou hast wrought without, now work within;</l>
            <l>My pain is gone, Lord cleanse me from my Sin:</l>
            <l>Thy healthful Spirit upon me bestow,</l>
            <l>That I in Grace may daily stronger grow.</l>
            <l>So strengthen me, that I may walk in ways</l>
            <l>Of Holiness and Peace through all my daies,</l>
            <l>Till thou shalt take me hence to live above,</l>
