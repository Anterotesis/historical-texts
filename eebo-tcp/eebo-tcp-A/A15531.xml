            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

If thonges of lether be made of the ſkynne of hym, &amp; a man gyrded with theym, he ſhall not feare hys enemies. And yf any man will eate of the fleſh of hym, &amp; will drynke of hys water

                  <p>¶ Pellicianus, the Pellicane is a byrd ſufficiently knowen, it is called of the Chaldeis Uoltri, &amp; of the Grekes Iphalari. The ver<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tue of it is meruaylous. If

yonge byrdes be kylled and their harte not be broken, &amp; if a parte of her bloud be taken and be put warme in the mouth of the yo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge byrdes, they wil receyue ſoone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayn lyfe as before.

And Hermes in the boke of Alchorath, &amp; Plinius doth wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe thys.</p>
                  <p>¶ Coruus, called of ſome a raue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and of others a crow, the vertue of thys fowle is meruaylous, as Euax and Aaron reherſe. If her egges be ſodden, &amp; be put agayne in the neſt, the rauen goeth ſone

to the read ſea, in a certayne Ile where Aldoricus or Alodrius is buryed, and ſhe bryngeth a ſtone where with ſhe toucheth her eg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and the egges be ſoone rawe as they ware before. It is a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaylous thynge to ſtyrre vp ſod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den egges. If thys ſtoone be put in a rynge, &amp; the leaf of the laurel tree put vnder it, &amp; a man beyng bounden in chaynes, or a doore ſhutte, be toucheth therwith, he that is bounde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhall ſone be low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and the doore ſhalbe opened. And yf this ſtone be put in a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s mouth, it geueth too hym vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of all byrdes. The ſtone is of Inde, becauſe it is fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de in Inde, after certayn wyſe men, &amp; ſometyme in the read ſea.

If it be hanged too the necke of an henne, ſhe will neuer ceaſe to runne, vntyll it be putte awaye. And yf a cockes combe be anoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the bloud of it, he will not crowe frome thens forthe. There is a certayn ſtone founde in the knees of thys byrde, if it be loked craftely, whiche if it be put in the meat of two enemies, they ſhalbe made frendes, and there ſhalbe made verye good peace a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monge them.</p>
                  <p>¶ Turtur, a Turtel is a byrd wel

If y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hart of thys foule be borne in a wolues ſkynne, he that beareth it, ſhall neuer haue an appetyte to committe lechery from thence forth.

                  <p>¶ Talpa, a molle is a beaſt well ynough knowen. The vertue of thys beaſt is meruaylous, as it
<pb facs="tcp:23693:41"/>
is rehearſed of Phyloſophers. If the fore of it be wrapped in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> leaf of a Laurell tree, &amp; be put in the mouth of an horſe, he wil flee for feare.

                  <p>¶ The maner of doyng all theſe beforeſayd things, that the effect may be good &amp; profitable is that it be doone vnder a fauourable planet, as Jupiter and Venus, &amp; thys is in their dayes &amp; houres. If any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> therfore will do theſe thynges truely, withoute doubt he ſhall fynde truth, &amp; very great effect or vertue, in the before ſaid thynges as I haue proued, &amp; ſene oftentymes together with oure brethren in oure tyme. Therfore let hym conſider here, which ſhal fynde plentye of the beforeſayde thinges, that he poſſeſſeth a lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and vertues. For if they be
<pb facs="tcp:23693:42"/>
done in their contraries, as a good effect in a maliciouſe ſigne, hys vertue and effecte ſhoulde be letted for his contrarie, &amp; ſo good and true thinges ſhould be diſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. We ſee very many to be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, in ſure &amp; true things, which if they hadde knowen, and kepte the qualities of ſignes or tymes they ſhould haue obteyned their will and effecte, in the aforeſayd thynges.</p>
                  <p>¶ Iſidorus ſemeth to ſaye, that the aſſhes of a great frogge, born at a womans gyrdle, reſtraineth greatly the commynge of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans naturall purgation,</p>
                  <p>¶ And in a probatio, yf it be boſt den too an hennes necke, there ſhall come forth no bloude of her or of an other beaſt.</p>
                  <p>¶ Alſo if it be tempered with wa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter,

&amp; the heade or an other place be anoynted with it, heare wyll no more growe there.</p>
                  <p>¶ If anye man beare a dogges hart on his left ſyde, all y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> dogges ſhall holde their peace, and not barke at hym.</p>

            <p>¶ After that thys was graffed in the myndes of the Philoſophers and they founde the diſpoſition of naturall thynges. For they knew ſurely that greate colde is graffed in ſome, in ſome greate boldenes,
