            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

his brother. Thrice in like sort
was I ask'd, &amp; yet vnask'd, ask'd of
my selfe, though vnask'd of others,
whether to one or three I would
dedicate this my threefold booke.
<pb facs="tcp:11841:3"/>
To this my self vnto my self made
answere: to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> more fitly should
I dedicate my first booke treating
of Vertue, then to my vertuous
brother? to whom my second of a
Familie, then to my familiar bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> my third of Ciuility,
then to my ciuil brother? The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of which points (deare
brother) moued me to present vnto
you alone, and not to three this
Groue of mine, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>formed as nere
as I could, like vnto that golden
groue of the ancient Hesperides.
VVherein I could be said to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate,
the Philosopher Athenodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,
who parted with his elder bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Zeno all his goods, &amp; gaue
vnto him the one half, for what is
more agreeable to nature, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that
<pb facs="tcp:11841:3"/>
one brother should to his power
reciprocally aid another? &amp; what
more prodigious, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that one bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
should bee a wolfe vnto an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other?
this plainly and wisely was
specified by the Greeke poet Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripides,
who said: questionlesse he
that loueth not his brother, loueth
neither him, that begat him, nor
her, that hare. And againe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
by Antigone in Sopho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles:
I must (quoth she) loue my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
better then my sonne, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
that hereafter I may very well
haue more sonnes, but, my father
&amp; mother being both dead, neuer
more brethren. Standing, I say,
vpon these termes, &amp; hammering
in my mind on the anuill of our mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall

duty to impart vnto you the iust

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Entle Reader, my two
yeeres silence since the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of my last Latine
poems argueth me in thy
censure, eyther to haue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerslept
my selfe with Epimenides, or to
haue plaid the micher amongst the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure
Antipodes. Which inconuenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
(I confesse) the worldes ingratitude,
being a great discouragement, and the
burthen of my professio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, a necessary im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment,
made me with diligent care to
attend another Cynosure, by which the
course of my studies might be directed.
In consideration whereof fearing some
patent of concealement I breake forth
at length, and am come to plead mine
own tenure in a more familiar language.
And this I do, aswell because euery one
may perfectly know my meaning, as
that I might craue pardon of mine audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,
if either I goe awrie, or chaunce to
trip, no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> goeth so vpright, but he may
by some casualty or other kisse the
ground. It is a good horse, that neuer

thy part (courteous Reader) to brooke
mine errours with patience.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:11841:5"/>
As for the subiect of my discourse, it
resembleth the hearbe Muscouy, in that
as it being ioyned to other flowers dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth
the sweetnes of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: so these fruits
of mine being now growne to a Groue,
will augment each other sauour to the
sence-pleasing comfort of the reader. If
any man delight to haue himselfe shine
with a glorious shewe of vertue, I haue
giuen him the toppes of moral behauior;
if to haue his house and family wel beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified;
I haue yeelded him diuers braun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
for that purpose; if to haue his cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
flourish, I haue sent him the deep-grounded
stemme of policy. And if the
greatest Gardener of the best manured
Eden had vouchsafed me the settes of
Diuiner worth, such as bloomed in the
holy and golden groues of his Prophets,
I would haue offred vp a sweet smelling
sacrifice of the purest choise; but since
that glorious Paradise for the first mans
offence hath bene shut vp from any en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traunce,
I thought good to present thee
with such fruites, as this earth affoords, a
three leau'd bud, not onely of inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
sweetnes to him, that hath it, but also

it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:11841:6"/>
In conclusion, wheras in these bookes
I make often mention of my Comenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
vpon Persius, thou shalt-vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d,
that I haue had the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ready together with

the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be closed in a case of delay &amp;

esteemed him to be an vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding,
that created all things of the element of

                  <p>OF Atheists there are two sorts: the
inward, and the outward. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Atheist is he, that slyly carieth the
countenaunce of a sheepe, and yet is no
sheepe, but a sheep-biter. He swaloweth
vp aduowsons, hospitals, and other mens
goods vnder pretence of simplicity. He
raiseth rents, incloseth commons, and
enhaunceth the price of corne. With
his wooll or wealth hee vseth to snarle
&amp; deceyue honest-minded men, whom
at length hee notwithstanding hauing
Scripture in his mouth snatcheth at most
greedily, &amp; clappeth in irons. This kind
of Atheist I will decipher hereafter.</p>
                  <p>The outward Atheist on the other
side openly professeth nature to be his
God. And euen as the spider infecteth
with poyson the fragrantst liquours hee
suckes; so the outward Atheist most
wickedly extracteth common places out
of the secretes of nature, and turning
them to his owne vse, hee blasphemeth
God, whom he neuer knew.</p>

one of the first authours of this sect,
that being fledde from Athens, and his
bookes burnt by vniuersall consent, he
was slaine by certaine men, whom the
Athenians had hired for that intent.
Pliny the elder, one likewise of the same

stampe, while hee was ouercurious in
searching <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
                     </hi> causes of nature, was choakt
neere to the mountaine Vesuuius with
smoake, and with the smell of brimstone
issuing out of the same. Pope Leo the

and Mahomet were three of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
dissemblers, was by the iust iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God sodainly strooken dead
with an extreame laughter. Likewise, an
Italian Captaine of late daies in the low
countries, leading his company to skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish
with the enemy, thus encouraged
them: Sirs, quoth he, remember the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
glory of our nation, and fight vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly:
as for your sinnes, if you die, you
shall vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, there is no God. Which
when he had said, he fought, &amp; was the
first man that was slaine. Not inferiour
to these was one Christopher Marlow
by profession a play-maker, who, as it is
reported, about 7. yeeres a-goe wrote a
booke against the Trinitie: but see the
effects of Gods iustice; it so hapned, that
at Detford, a litle village about three
miles distant from London, as he meant
to stab with his ponyard one named In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gram,
that had inuited him thither to a
<pb facs="tcp:11841:21"/>
feast, and was then playing at tables, he
quickly perceyuing it, so auoyded the
thrust, that withall drawing out his dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
for his defence, hee stabd this Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
into the eye, in such sort, that his
braines comming out at the daggers
point, hee shortlie after dyed. Thus

what was the most wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

Man. Hermes Trismegistius termed ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the great miracle. Others called him the
little world. Likewise, the wisest Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers
agreed, that mans body is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
of the foure elements, and of all
their qualities. For the flesh agreeth fitly
with the earth: his vitall spirites with the
aire &amp; the fire: and his humours with the
water. The sense of touching consen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
with the earth. The sense of seeing
with the fire: that of smelling with the
aire and fire: that of tasting with the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
&amp; that of hearing with the aire. Yea,
there is no part in the whole body of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
wherein one of the elements doth not
interpose his vertue, albeit one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is
<pb facs="tcp:11841:22"/>
alwayes predominant ouer the rest. And
most certaine it is,<note place="margin">Ce. 1. 27</note> that <hi>Man is a creature
made of God after his owne Image,</hi> well
disposed by nature, composed of bodie
and soule. In this sort man had his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
and being of the great and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
builder of the world; of whom like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
hee was created so noble for three
reasons. The first, that by this meanes
man knowing howe God hath placed
him aboue all other liuing creatures, he
might be induced dayly to loue and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
him, as is meete. And therefore did
the Lord place the eies in mans bodie to
behold his wonderfull workes. And for
this cause also did he fasten eares to mans
head, that hee shoulde vnderstand and
keep his commandements. The second,
to the ende, that acknowledging the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
place &amp; race from whence he came,
hee might feare to staine his name and
fame with dishonest &amp; vnlawfull deeds.
The third, that hee, not being ignorant
of his owne excellencie, shoulde extoll
himselfe in God, and in him, &amp; through
him he should iudge himselfe worthy of
heauenly felicitie.</p>

Which truly in my iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t spru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g
vp of their negligence, in not ferreting

Chap. 11.</head>
                  <p>THe roote of vice is the originall cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
wherewith mankind hath
bene ouerwhelmed euer since the fall of
Adam. Which corruption in processe of
time beyng growne by continuall cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome
into a sinfull habite, becommeth
damnable three maner of waies. First,
by thoughts; next by wordes, as, swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
lies; lastly, by deedes, as murther,
adulterie.</p>
                  <p>Now for the curing of this Hydra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
malady, sixe things are to be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.
First, we must oft consider, that the
actes of vertues themselues cannot bee
of any value with God, except we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
exercise our selues therein. For
the longer wee delay,<note n="*" place="margin">Resol. li. 1. part. 2 cap. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>the more is the
kingdome and power of the Diuell establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and confirmed in vs.</hi> Secondly, wee
must once or twice a day at least call to
remembrance our vices, &amp; with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite
heart aske God forgiuenes. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
we must waigh with our selues, how
that we are wandring pilgrimes in this
world, and like vnto them, that vpon
<pb facs="tcp:11841:31"/>
their iourneys abide not in those Innes,
where they are well lodged, but after
their baite do depart homeward, vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
these words of the Prophet: * <hi>Woe is
me,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ps. 120.</note> 
                     <hi>that I remaine in Mesech, and dwell in
the tents of Kedar.</hi> The fourth remedy
against vice is, that we thinke on the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold
miseries of this life, &amp; on the end
thereof. The fift, wee must oftentimes
repeat that fearful saying of the Apostle:
* <hi>If the iust shall scarce be saued,</hi>

In the yeere of our Lord 1576. Anne
Aueries widow, forswearing her selfe for
a little money, that shoulde haue beene
payde for sixe pounde of tow, at a shop
in Woodstreete of London, fell imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly
downe speechlesse, casting vp at
her mouth the same matter, which by
course of nature shoulde haue beene a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyded
downewards, till she died. Thus
did God reward periurie.</p>

vs? I feare me, that many of them hauing
as it were but a glimpse of the Gospel of
Christ, will goe before vs Protestants in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the euerlasting Paradise. We know in
our consciences, that cursers and blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemers
are hainous offenders in the
sight of God. Howbe it neuerthelesse,
we liue carelesse and obstinate, as bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
either dazeled like vnto owles at the
eminent light of the Gospel, or else be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched
and charmed by the empoyso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
guiles of this world, and the Prince
of this world. Our vsuall speeches in our
anger are these: The Diuell take him,
Vengeance light vpon him, A poxe on
thee, A plague on thee. Al which horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
curses haue already fallen on some of
our pates, &amp; that within these 7. yeeres.
<pb facs="tcp:11841:42"/>
The plague first ouerspread it selfe
through London the Metropolitane Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of this Realme, and from thence it
crept into euerie shire in particular. The
poxe likewise hath not beene absent,
which many parents to their great griefe
can testifie. As for the other two, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell
and vengeance, the gallowes being
burthened with traytors, murtherers, and
felons, may giue sufficient euidence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
vs.</p>
                  <p>Now concerning blasphemie, the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers
thereof haue not altogether esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
scotfree, as appeared by Duke Ioye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,
who about eyght yeere since, felt the
smart of his impious deserts. This Duke,
one of the cheefest of the leaguers in
France, beeing ouercome by the French
Kings forces that now raigneth, and des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing
of any good successe, vomited
forth these wordes: Farewell my great
Cannons: I renounce God, and wil run
this day a high fortune. With that hee
galloped amaine, and plunged himselfe,
horse and all into the riuer Tar, where
presently hee was swallowed vp. Thus
did God worke the end of this blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Duke. And I pray God they may
<pb facs="tcp:11841:42"/>
so still bee rewarded that blaspheme
him, which causeth the foundations of
the earth to tremble, in any Realme or
nation in the worlde whatsoeuer. What
shall I write of the Franciscan Friers,
who blasphemously compare their Frier
Frauncis vnto Christ, saying, that Christ
did not any thing, but Frauncis did
the same? yea; Francis did more then
Christ, for his nayles droue away temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.
O childish comparison! Of this
blasphemous route is Bellarmine, that
Archpapist, as by these his words it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth.<note n="a" place="margin">Bellarm. lib. 2. de Mona. cap. 13. Leuit. 24. &amp; §. vlt. in Nou. 77.

If we, quoth he, cannot by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
meanes keepe the lawe of God, then
God is more vniust, and more cruell
then any tyrant. The punishment of
cursers and blasphemers were diuers.
Sometimes they were punished by
death. Sometimes * their tongues were
cutte or bored through. And at other
times their punishments were arbittarie
according to the number of their offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
Likewise king Lewes of France hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Lord of lenuile, one of his Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons,
blaspheme God, caused him to be
apprehended, and his lips to be slit with
an hotte iron. For which notable act of
<pb facs="tcp:11841:43"/>
iustice, he afterwards deserued the name
of a Saint.</p>
                  <p>Let vs therefore consider of these both

First, there be forraine enemies, such as
the Spaniards bee vnto vs at this instant,
who by an vniuersall consent, doe wage
warre against vs, and these are proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to bee termed enemies. Secondly,
Rebelles, of which number wee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
the Earle of Tyrone, and the
<pb facs="tcp:11841:44"/>
wild Irish, who haue traitorously re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolted
from her Maiesties iurisdiction,
are to be called enemies. Thirdly, wee
name Pirats, rouers &amp; theeues. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
wee name aduersaries, amongst who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
ciuill discords hapneth, enemies. Fiftly,
banished persons, outlawes, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
men, haue the title of enemies.
In which ranke, I place Robin Hood,
little Iohn, and their outlawde traine,
who spoylde the kings subiects. Lastly,
Fugitiues, and runnagate seruants, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
warre with their masters, deserue
the name of enemies. In the beadroll of
these enemies, flatterers, conicatchers,
slanderers, and Promooters, disturbers
of the publike rest may be added.</p>
                  <p>Nowe to the question, whether wee
ought to keepe touch with all these sorts
of enemies? It seemeth vnfaignedly, that
we should, as shall more manifestly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
by these reasons.<note place="margin">Leuit. 19</note> First, * othes by
the testimonies of the scriptures,<note place="margin">Deut. 5.</note> are to be
obserued.<note place="margin">Iosua. 9.</note> Secondly, * euill is not to bee

that goodnesse may ensue: no,
not although a man should lose his life
<pb facs="tcp:11841:44"/>
for it. Thirdly, of two euils, the least is to
bee chosen: but periurie is a greater euil
then losse of goods and landes, yea, and
which is more, it is greater then losse of
life: therefore it is better to lose life
and liuing, then to burthen our consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
with the abominable sinne of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie.<note place="margin">Ambros. lib. 1. Offic. c. 29.</note>
Fourthly, there cannot be hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie
nor quietnesse amongst vs, if wee
break our othes. Sixtly, it is no poynt of
liuely magnanimitie to engage our faith,
vnlesse wee were willing to performe it:
for<note n="h" place="margin">Psal. 15.</note> who shal dwel in Gods tabernacle?
who shall rest vpon his holy hil? euen he
that setteth not by himselfe. It is rather
the propertie of follie, for that a foole wil
sweare any thing for his owne safegard:
whereas a man of discretion will consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
wel, and weigh his speech as it were
by the ounce, before hee pawne it. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenthly,
whatsoeuer a man sweareth, and
may performe with the fauor of God, &amp;
without sinne, that same, albeit compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
is to bee obserued, for the name of
God is of greater estimation, then al te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
commodities: such is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
which a man sweareth vnto theeues,

GOD permitteth temptations:

not prophane his othe. Likewise Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiauell

selfe at this time with the rehearsall one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of two of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the memory wherof, is
as yet rife amongst many of vs. In the
yeere of our Lorde 1561. and the third
yeere of the raigne of Queen Elizabeth,
there was in London one William Ief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fery,
that impudently affirmed Iohn
Moore a companion of his, to bee Iesus
Christ, and would not reuoke his foolish
beleefe, vntill hee was whipped from
Southwarke to Bedlem, where the saide
Moore meeting with him, was whipped
likewise, vntill they both confessed that
Christ was in heauen, &amp; themselues but
sinfull and wicked heretiques. In like
maner, about ten yeeres ago, I my selfe
being then a scholer at Westminster,
Henry Arthingto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; Edmond Coppin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
two gentlemen, bewitched by one
William Hackets dissimulations, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
him to bee the Messias, and
<pb facs="tcp:11841:46"/>
thereupon ranne into Cheapside, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming
the said Hacket to bee Christ.
For which hereticall or rather Diuelish
deuice they were apprehended and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoned:
&amp; in the end Hacket was han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
on a gallowes placed vp in Cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side;
Arthington was kept in prison vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
hope of repentance; &amp; Coppinger died
for sorrow the next day in Bridewell.</p>
                  <p>Thus we see that truth, although for
a time it be darkened by a cloude, yet at
last it preuailes and gettes the victory: &amp;
the Heretiques themselues are by Gods
speciall iudgements confounded, and
their couragious opinions in a moment
abated. Neither will it be long, ere that
the Romish Bishop, the sonne of Belial
shall see<note n="*" place="margin">Psal. 2.</note> his power brused with a rod
of iron, and broken in peeces like a pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters

                     <hi>that consisteth
in atchieuing of great exploits:</hi> and is
touched chiefly vpon eight occasions.
First, a magnanimous man is he, that wil
neuer be induced to enterprise any dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honest
point against any man, no not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
his vtter enemy. Secondly, he will
chuse the meane rather then the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame.
Thirdly, he will tell his minde
plainly without dissimulation. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
he will not respect what the common
people speake of him, nor will hee mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
his actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s according to their applau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.

                     <hi>though
he should see all the world eagerly bent to
fight, and though hee should see euery thing
round about him set on fire, and almost con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed,
yet he notwithstanding through an

Sixtly, a magnanimous man will with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw

matters,<note n="*" place="margin">Psal. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>and in Gods law will he exercise
<pb facs="tcp:11841:48"/>
himselfe day and night.</hi> Seuenthly, a mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimous
man wil scorne vices, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
iniuries. Eightly, he will speake no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but wise and premeditated words,
according to that old saying: A barking
dog wil neuer proue good biter, and the
deepest riuers runne with least noise.</p>
                  <p>The auncient Christians of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue
Church were right examples of
this vertue Magnanimity, as they, who
had all the properties thereof imprinted
in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. They, I say, who cheerefully gaue
themselues to be massacred and tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
Like vnto these were our late En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish

who gladly in defence of the true reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion

For the vndoubted beleefe of tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph
in heauen both diminished and
tooke away the corporall griefe, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plenished
the mind with cheerfulnesse

but a bubble on the face of the earth.
They considered with themselues our
miserable estate; for assoone as wee are
borne, wee seeme to flourish for a small
moment, but straightway wee die, and
there is litle memorial left behind. They
<pb facs="tcp:11841:49"/>
knew Magnanimity to be the ornament
of all the vertues. Briefly, they perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

The first is, that causeth a man neither

                  <p>First, let the ambitious man consider
whereof he is made, namely, of dust &amp;
ashes. Secondly, he must diligently goe
to heare Sermons, and read the holy Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.

Fiftly, let him compare his owne deeds
with those of the holy me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s in times past.
<pb facs="tcp:11841:50"/>
Sixtly, hee must not enquire what the
common people say of him. Seuenth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
let him take heed by other mens
harmes, and muse vpon the case of those
men, who desiring to eate some fruite,
regarded not the height of the tree,
whereon they grew, but laboured to

Chap. 31.</head>
                  <p>INtemperaunce is an ouerflowing in
pleasures, desperately constraining all
reason, in such sort, that nothing is able
to stay him from the execution of his
lusts. For that cause there is a difference
betweene it and incontinence, namely,
that an incontinent man knoweth full,
that the sinne which hee commits is sin,
and had intended not to follow it, but
being ouermastered by his Lordly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbations,
hee yeeldeth in a manner a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
his will thereunto: whereas the
intemperate man sinneth of purpose, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeming
it a goodly thing, and neuer
repents him once of his wickednesse.
<pb facs="tcp:11841:55"/>
Wherehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce I conclude, that an intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
man is incurable, and farre worse
then the incontinent: for the inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
man being perswaded with whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
counselles, will bee sorie for his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
and wil striue to ouercome his pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.
But to make both, aswell the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate
man, as the incontinent hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
vnto vs: Let vs call to minde, howe
they do nothing else, but thinke on their
present prouender and rutting. Also, wee
must consider, how that intemperance is
that goggle-eyed Venus, which hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth
honest learning, which meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphozeth
a man into a beast, and
which transformeth simple wretches in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
tosse-potted asses: wherefore I wish
all men of what qualitie soeuer they bee,
to take heede of this vice, least they ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

will declare one notable example, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
out of the Anatomie of Abuses.
About twentie yeeres since, there dwelt
eight men, Citizens and Citizens
Sonnes of Swaden a Cittie of Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie,
who vpon a Sunday morning, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
to goe into a Tauerne, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to the house of one Antonie
Hage, an honest man, and zealous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
giuen, they called for wine. The
good man tolde them that they should
haue none, before Sermon time was
past, and perswaded them to goe heare
the woord preached. But they (saue
one Adam Giebens, who aduised
them to heare the Sermon for feare of
GODS wrath) denyed, saying, that
they loathed that kinde of exercise.
The good Oast neither giuing them
any Wine himselfe, nor permitting any
other, went to the Sermon. Who being
gone, they fel to cursing, &amp; wishing that
<pb facs="tcp:11841:58"/>
he might breake his necke before he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned:
whereupon the diuell appeared
vnto them in the shape of a yong man,
bringing in his hand a flagon of wine, &amp;
drunke vnto them, saying: Good fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes,
be merrie, for you shall ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e wine
inough, &amp; I hope you wil pay me well.
Then they inconsiderately aunswered,
that they would paye him, or else they
would gage their neckes, yea, their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
and soules, rather the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to faile. Thus
they continued swilling and bibbing so
long, till they could scant see one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
At the last, the Diuell their tap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
told them, that they must needs pay
their shot: whereat their hearts waxed
cold. But he comforting them, sayd: Be
of good cheere, for now must you drinke
boyling lead, pitch; and brimstone with
me in the pit of hell for euermore. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon
hee made their eyes appeare like
fire, and in breadth as broad as a sawcer:
and ere they could call for grace &amp; mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
the diuell preuented them, &amp; brake
their necks asunder. The other Adam
Giebens, who counselled them before
to heare Gods word, hauing some sparks
of faith within him, was preserued from
<pb facs="tcp:11841:58"/>
death, by the great mercie of God.</p>
                  <p>After this sort God punished drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennesse,
to the terrour of all such as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light

liberal, &amp; so vphold his reputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
The first lawe of liberalitie is, to distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
vnto them, who are most worthie:
Otherwise, he is like a blinde man, when
<pb facs="tcp:11841:61"/>
he knoweth not to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he giueth: name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
he must obserue the order of nature,
in preferring his brethren before his
cosens, &amp; his cosens before strangers, &amp;
<note n="a" place="margin">Macr lib. 2. sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnal.</note>
                     <hi>in rewarding of wise men, before sycopha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts
&amp; pickthanks.</hi> The second circumstance
is, that a man giue not more, then his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie
wil afford, but rather he must cut
out his coate in proportion according to
his cloth: because<note n="c" place="margin">Plinius iuni. lib. 7. Epist.</note> 
                     <hi>repentance followeth
hastie liberalitie.</hi> The third, hee must not
giue to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which haue inough alreadie.
The fourth, he must not, after he hath
bestowed his gifts, cast and hitte men in
the teeth with them, or by his prating,
cause the remembraunce of his gifts to
perish. The fift rule of liberalitie, a man
must not hurt one, that he may be liberal
to another, for they that do this, are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to bee accounted beneficall nor li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall,
but pernicious. The sixt, he must
giue willingly without requesting, for
nothing is more deere then that, which
is bought by praiers. Hitherto apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayneth
the Apostles saying:<note place="margin">2. Cor. 9.</note> 
                     <hi>As e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie
man wisheth in his heart, so lette him
giue, not grudgingly, nor of necessitie:
for GOD loueth a cheerefull Giuer.</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:11841:62"/>
The seuenth, lette him respect the place,
where hee giueth, that is, whether in
an honest house, or in an infamous. The
last law of liberalitie is, that it be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
shipwracke or losse of the giuers
good name.</p>
                  <p>But why doe I decipher that, which
nowe a dayes men haue vtterly abando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned?
Where in England, nay, where in
the world, can I poynt with my finger, &amp;
say: There is a liberall man? Alas, al men
are become misers, there are none that
are liberall, no, not one. O vngrateful
wretcheslis not God your Landlord, and
doth not hee suffer you to enioye his
lands without in comes or fines? Onely
this is his conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that ye vse the poore
well, and cherish the needie: why then
are yee couetous, why doe yee not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
his condition, and bee liberall? It
behooues you rather to lay vp riches in
heauen, and not to beleeue, that this fic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle
and doating worlde, is a perpetuall
paradise, &amp; that the drossie excrements
therof, are hallowed. Communicat ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
your goods one vnto another, for
treasure remaineth prepared for the
godly in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Let not the hellish vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
<pb facs="tcp:11841:62"/>
haue dominion ouer you: he is Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus
(as the Poets faigne) the God of your
riches. Beware of his fawnings, take
heede of his motiues and illusions; hee
commeth disguised in the forme of an
Angell of light, perswading you by so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phistrie,
that liberalitie is a vice, that
golden duckets are demie Gods. But
what followeth after all these fallacies?
death, and the vengeance of the highest.
To be short, as many as are well disposed
to be liberall, let them giue in their liues
time, whilst they haue space to giue. It is
foolishnesse for any man to defer his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beralitie
till after his death: for execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
will part stakes; and besides, almes
at that time, will do the giuers no good.</p>

                  <p>THe properties of a couetous ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are

he is a theefe, for the goods that hee
possesseth, are none of his owne, but
Gods. Man is only constituted as a stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard,

Thirdly, a couetous man is a slaue,
for he attendeth &amp; wayteth on his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.
Fourthly, he is in continuall feare

that she seekes his vtter vndooing.

them from spending. Lastly, a couetous

                  <p>Calipha the Soldan of Egypt, hauing
filled a Tower with golde and pretious
stones, and being in war with Allan the
king of Tartarie, was at last taken cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
by him, &amp; famished in that tower,
wherein his treasure lay. More strange is
that, which is reported of an Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of Mogunce, who in the yeere of
our Lorde 1518. foreseeing that corne
would the next yeere be sold at an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame
rate, gathered together great
store, and whorded the same vp in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
garners, which he had built for the
same purpose; not with a godly intent to
bring downe the price, but rather to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haunce
it for his own priuate commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
But behold the iudgements of God;
his seruants the next yeere ouerturning
this whorded corne, founde cleane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie
<pb facs="tcp:11841:65"/>
to their expectations snakes, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
and vermine so thicke crept in, that
it was impossible to saue ought thereof.
The like, as I heard, hapned about a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen
yeeres agoe vnto a wicked niggard
here in England. Also, to mine owne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance,
there was one in the yeere
1589. that sent foure bushels of wheat
(euery one consisting of two bushels &amp;
a halfe of Winchester measure) into the
market, and was offred 22. shillings for
euery bushell, which he refused, hoping
to get 2. shillings more on the next mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket
day. But see the reward of couetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes:
wheat was the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sold for 16. shillings,
&amp; within 2. markets after for a noble, in
somuch that that man, which refused to
take 22. shillings for euery bushell, was
now glad to haue a noble for the same.
Likewise a certain knight of Oxfordshire
punished very iustly (but ouerseuerely)
the couetousnes of a priest, that denied
the seruice of his office in the burying of
a dead body, because his widow had not
wherwith to pay him y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> costs of the fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral.
For the Knight himselfe going to the
buriall, caused the minister to be bound
to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> corps, &amp; so to be cast both into one
graue. Which done, he rode straightway
<pb facs="tcp:11841:65"/>
to the Court, &amp; with some intercession
begd his pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Q. Mary. The like fact
I heard was put in practize by Iohn Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria
Duke of Millan aboue an 100. yeers
since. What shall I speake of the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnes
of one Peter Vnticaro a Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard?
who with certaine other Christians,
to the nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of 263. hauing bene a long
time withholden captiues in Alexandria
by the great Turke, at le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth in the yeere
of our Lord 1577. conspired together
for their deliuery, &amp; by good lucke kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the Gailer, and then entring into his
cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d a chest, wherin were great
store of double duckets, which this Peter
Vnticaro, &amp; two more opening, stuffed
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues so ful as they could therewith,
between their shirts &amp; their skin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which
th'other Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s wold not once touch,
but said, that it was their liberty, which
they sought for, to the honour of God, &amp;
not to make a mart of the infidels wicked
treasure. Yet did these words sinke no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
into their stomacks. But within a
while after, in a skirmish with the warder
of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prison, P. Vnticaro &amp; th'other 2. that
were armed with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> duckets, were slain,
as not able to weild the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues, being so
<pb facs="tcp:11841:66"/>
pestered with the weight and vneasie
carriage of the duckets.</p>

                  <p>INdulgence is a fond, vaine, &amp; foolish
loue, vsed most commonly of parents
towards their children. There is no vice
so abhorred of wise men as this; For
they find by experience, that mo youths
haue bene cast away through their pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts
indulgence, then either through vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
or naturall death. Yea, I haue heard
sundry Gentlemen, when they came to
yeeres of discretion, grieuously ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime,
and bitterly complaine of their
parents fondnesse, saying: <hi>Wee would to
God that our parents had heretofore kept
vs in awe and seuerity; for now lacking that
instruction, which we ought to haue, wee feele
the smart thereof.</hi> Vndoubtedly God wil
one day demaund an account of them,
and examine them, wherefore they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected
not better their owne bowels.
Shall he blesse them with children, and
they through blind indulgence neglect
their education? Truly, it is a miserable
case. In times past parents were wont to
place their sonnes with wise gouernors,
requesting them not in any case to let
them haue their owne willes. But now
<pb facs="tcp:11841:71"/>
adaies it falles out cleane contrary. For
parents in these times when they hire a
scholemaster, will first hearken after his
gentle vsage, and then they will questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with him touching the small salary,
which they must pay him for his indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry,
so that forsooth now and then to be
mindfull of this vice Indulgence, they
accept of a sow-gelder, or some pety
Grammatist, that will not sticke in a
foole-hardy moode to breake Priscians
pate. With such a one they couenaunt,
namely, that hee must spare the rodde,
or els their children will be spild. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
a while after assoone as their indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
Master hath taught them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
<hi>Stultus, Stulta, Stultum,</hi> as an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectiue
of three terminations, they bring
them out of hand into the Vniuersity,
and there diligently do enquire after a
milde Tutour, with whome their ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
sonnes might familiarly and fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerse. And what then? Mary, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a tweluemoneths end, they send for
them home againe in all post haste to
visit their mammes, who thought each
day of their sonnes absence to bee a
whole moneth. There they bee made
<pb facs="tcp:11841:72"/>
sucklings during the next twelue mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth.
Well, now it is high time to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
their ready da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dlings to see new-fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled

Where being arriued, they suite them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
vnto all sorts of company, but for
the most part vnto shriuers, Caualeers,
and mad-cappes, insomuch at the last, it
will be their friends hard happe, to heare
that their sweet sonnes are eyther pend
vp in New-gate for their good deeds, or
haue crackt a rope at Tiburn. This is the
effect of Indulgence. This is their false

a certaine woman in Flaunders, who li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
about threescore yeeres agoe, did
so much pamper two of her sonnes, that
shee would neuer suffer them to lacke
money; yea, shee would priuily defraud
her husband to minister vnto them. But
at last she was iustly punished in them
both, for they fell from dicing and rio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to stealing, and for the same one of
them was executed by the halter, &amp; the
other by the sword, she her selfe being
present at their wofull ends, whereof her

was the onely cause.</p>
                  <p>This ought to be a liuely glasse to all
parents to prouide for their childrens

of their wild and wicked humours, least

your childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, while they be young; pluck

growing among the good seed they hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

spirit, for where by it wee are borne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new
&amp; of wild wolues made tame sheep:
so contrariwise Anger corrupteth vs, &amp;
of sheep reduceth vs to be wolues. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
Anger permitteth not a man to
follow good &amp; wholesome counsels, nor
to consider of that, which he hath to do.
Thirdly, Anger is acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panied with am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition,

and in his madnesse killed himselfe.</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:11841:78"/>
Fourthly, Anger maketh a man to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueale
secrets like to a drunkard. Fiftly,
Anger diffigureth a man, for it causeth
him to stammer and hack in his speech,
to waxe red, to looke pale; yea, it cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth

                  <head>Remedies against Anger.
Chap. 55.</head>
                  <p>EVen as they that feare to be besie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
do beforehand prepare victuals
to auoid famine, and also bulwarks, and
warlike engines to repell the enemy,
and defend themselues: so in like ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
they, that see themselues naturally
disposed to anger, ought to premedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate,
and find out beforehand certaine
medicines for the same; with which
<pb facs="tcp:11841:78"/>
being made mild, they may resist anger,
or at least so temper themselues, that
they may not be afflicted. In conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
whereof, I will sette downe tenne
kindes of salues. The first is, that the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grie
man<note n="c" place="margin">Ephes. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>let not the sunne go downe vpon
his wrath:</hi> nor delay it, for feare lest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed
anger breede hatred. The second
remedie, the angrie man must haue a
lowly and humble spirit, and<note n="*" place="margin">Senec. in Thebaid.</note> 
                     <hi>addict his
mind to pietie,</hi> and to the reading of the
scriptures. The third, he must not be too
credulous, curious, nor superfluous in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing. The fourth, he must perswade
himselfe, how that euerie man is by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
dull, weake, and fraile, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hard for his seruants to please him.
The fift salue against anger is, that the
angrie ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> reade the treatises of Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
concerning patience, and gather
some flowers thereof into a breuiarie.
The sixt, he must whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> some haue offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
him, repeate ouer some tract or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
before hee bee throughly angrie.
The seuenth, let the angrie man bethink
with himselfe, touching the ilfauoured
countenance of such, whom hee saw an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grie;
and when he himselfe is angrie, hee
<pb facs="tcp:11841:79"/>
must take a looking-glasse in his hand,
and therein beholde the fashion of his
face, and whether it bee altered or no.
The eight, the angrie patient must es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chew
such meates as ingender choller,
and eate the contrarie: and, if yet he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mende
not, hee must repaire to the
Phisicion, and either purge that chole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricke
humour, or else vse Phlebotomie.
The ninth, lette him muse vpon the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of our Sauiour Christ. The tenth
and last salue is, that hee waigh with
himselfe the vncertaintie of this life, and
consider of the ioyes of heauen, and of
the torments of hell.</p>

instabilitie of this fickle worlde,
and beholde the aduersitie, which sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie

in conscience, and enforced to impart
those fewe medicines which I knowe,
vnto the view of the worlde.<note n="z" place="margin">Act. 3.</note>

<pb facs="tcp:11841:79"/>

giue I vnto you.</hi> My first remedie is, that
the afflicted person haue recourse to
God, &amp; heartily beseech his Maiestie to
forgiue him all his sinnes. The second,
the distressed patient must beleeue,
that all aduersities whatsoeuer, tend
to some scope or other, namely, for our
misdemeanours towardes GOD, or
for our triall: and for this cause it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient,
that hee reioyce and bee glad,
that God hath such a respect vnto him,
in chastizing him in this worlde. The
third remedie is, that hee perswade him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
to bee free, and his owne man:
whereas others liue in subiection to
their diuelish pelfe, and are toyled with
legions of troubles.<note place="margin">Boetius lib. 1. de Consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophiae. metr. 4.</note> This the patient

(quoth hee) <hi>careth and feareth the losse
of worldly things, or wisheth for temporall

The fourth salue for aduersitie is, that
the patient man read ouer the scripture
diligently, and there beholde, as in a
cleere glasse, the aduersitie and pouertie
of Christ &amp; his disciples. The fift reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
in such a case is, to<note n="n" place="margin">Comi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naus li. 5 cap. 5.</note>

familiar friend: for that easeth the minde,
and by talking thus in counsell with a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
friend, the spirits recouer their former
vertue and strength.</hi> The sixt, that he ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
reade himselfe, or heare some other
reading the Treatises of morall Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie,
namely, Seneca the Philosopher,

to seeke the auoyding of that, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
by any meanes bee auoyded. The
eight medicine is, that hee premeditate
with himself, after what maner he might
beare his aduersitie, that is, whether it
be better to dwell in his owne country,
or in a forraigne land: and whether hee
should applie himselfe to this or that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupation:
The ninth reason is to reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

that<note n="a" place="margin">Lucre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius li. 3. de rerum natura.</note>

                  <p>FLatterie is hardly discerned from

espie, and that especially by these to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens.
First, a flatterer is accustomed

Thirdly, A Flatterer, when a man hath

Fourthly, a flatterer will take vpon him

wherein our forefathers by the illusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

Albeit they flourish for a while,

their deserts: for GOD, when hee

For manifestation wherof, I will propose
certaine late examples, and which haue
chanced within this last age.</p>
                  <p>In the yeere of our Lord 1503. Cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar
Borgias determining to poyson a
Cardinall, and others, inuited them to
supper, and for that purpose, sent before
a flaggon of wine that was infected with
poyson, by a seruant, that knew nothing
of the matter, commanding that no man
should touch them: but such is the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God, who in the execution of
iustice, raiseth one tyrant to kil another,
and breaketh the brands of fire vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the head of him that first kindled it:
Pope Alexander the sixt, Cesar Borgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
his father, comming by aduenture
in somewhat before Supper, and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
with the exceeding drought of the
weather, called for drinke: and because
his own prouision was not as the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> brought
<pb facs="tcp:11841:86"/>
from the palace, he that had the infec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
wine in charge, thinking it to bee
recommended to his keeping for
wine most excellent, gaue the Pope to
drinke of the same wine, which Cesar
Borgias his bastard sonne had sent: who
likewise arriuing, while his father was
drinking, drunke also of the same wine;
being but iust, that they both should tast
of the same cup, which they had prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
for others.</p>
                  <p>In the yeere of our Lord 1563. the
Duke of Guise purposing to sacke the
Citie of Orleans, wrote vnto the Queen
Mother, that within foure and twentie
howres after he would send her word of
the taking of Orleans, wherein hee
would not spare any man, woman or
childe whatsoeuer: and that after hee
had kept his Shrouetide therein, hee
would in such sort spoile and destroy the
towne, that the memorie thereof should
be extinct for euer. But man purposeth,
and God disposeth: for the same day, as
the Duke about euening returned from
the camp to the Castle, where he lodged,
minding to execute that, which he had
written vnto the Queene, a yong man
<pb facs="tcp:11841:86"/>
named Iohn Poltrot, hauing long time
before intended to giue the stroke, stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for him in the way, as hee returned to
his lodging, and discharged his pistoll
laden with three bullets at him, whereof
the Duke presently after died.</p>
                  <p>In like maner the Duke his sonne, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
occasioned that bloudy massacre at

                  <p>NOt without reason are vices named

enuy from the dog. All which saue enuy
may sophistically be iustified: as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
niggardize is shadowed vnder
the number and care of wife and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and otherwhiles vnder the vaile of
pouerty. Pride pleadeth, that familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
breeds contempt, and that she must
obey the importunity of the times.
Anger alleadgeth the ingratitude of
men, the indignity of iniuries, the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paragement
and shame, that may fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
by too much patience. Gluttony
sheweth, that hee hath a strong consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
of body, a good stomack to his
meat, and therefore hang sorrow and
kill care. Sluggishnesse declareth, that
labour and study consume the vitall spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites,
that he, which sleepes well, thinkes
no harme, and he that thinks no harme,
<pb facs="tcp:11841:87"/>
pleaseth God. Thus euery vice for the
most part can shrowd it selfe vnder some
cloake or other. But, Enuy, where is
thy excuse? Truly, thou hast nothing
to say for thy selfe. Onely thou mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest

Examples aswell domesticall as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine
be infinite concerning enuy: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
at this time I will rehearse but one,
and that a forraine one. In the yeere of
our Lord 1596. the Duke of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,
seing that our English fleet had burnt
the Spanish nauy, &amp; had take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the towne
of Cales, and doubting that the other
nauy, which he had at S. Lucas would ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
be compelled to yeeld, or pay ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some,
was so enuious of our happy suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse,
that he caused it immediatly to be
set on fire, so that to spare a reasonable
redemption, he rashly lost twelue milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

the nauy valued.</p>
                  <p>Amongst other sins, which the Turks

First, it is taken for the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuersall
perfection of Art, which
wee comprehend in GOD.
So we say, that<note n="*" place="margin">Plato lib. 10. de Legib.</note> 
                     <hi>the world, and all that
therein is, were made by Gods art.</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the name of Art is put for the simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
and shadow of that, which shineth
in beasts, birds, flies, &amp; such like. In this
sence it is said, that the spider shewed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
vs the art of spinning. The Bee taught
vs to conforme things in order. The fish
learned vs the Art of swimming. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the name of Art is extended to the
general habit of the mind, as farre forth
as we do any thing by it, that is sepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from nature. So Grammar, Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,
Musick, Arithmetick, Logick, Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ometry,

Artes. Likewise in this sence Prudence
is named the art of composing mans
actions: Science the Art of discerning
<pb facs="tcp:11841:90"/>
the truth. Fourthly, the name of Art is
taken for that true forme of Art, which

This politicia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s do very wel know;
for how is it possible, that a common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth

hee kept a priuate booke for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,

realme, &amp; the treasure, which yeerely
his officers receiued into the Excheker.
As concerning the nature of people, I

countreys they become ciuill &amp; courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.
Also, we see, that they, which dwell
neere the sea, and farre from London,
are for the most part more fierce and
hardy, then those, which liue in the midst
of England. Moreouer, it behoueth a
prudent man to consider, that some
kind of people be angry by nature, some
be impudent, some fearefull, and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
be giuen to newfangled fashions,
to drunkenesse, and lechery. In like

death, then in England.</hi> The nature of
Welshmen is kind, haughty, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digall
of life and bloud. The Irish are

                  <p>VEry children knowe, that there bee
foure kinds of Matrimonie: namely,
that of honour, of loue, of toyle, and of
griefe. The matrimonie of honor is said
to be tripartite. The first is metaphysi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,
and supernatural, wherby God and
mans nature do mystically meete toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
The effect whereof, was in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation
of our Sauior Christ. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
degree of the matrimonie of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
is, when God &amp; the soule are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined,
euen by grace and glorie. The
third is, when God &amp; his Church meete
together, and are vnited in one mystical
body.</p>
                  <p>The matrimonie of loue is, when an
honest man and an honest woman are
linked together by God, for the propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of mankind.</p>
                  <p>The matrimony of toyle, &amp; that which
<pb facs="tcp:11841:97"/>
is most co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon in this last rotten world,
is, when men choose wiues not by the
eares, that is, for their good report; but
by the fingers, to witte, for their large
dowries; not in hope of issue, but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of their outward beautie, which fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
away like the lillies of the fielde.</p>
                  <p>The matrimonie of griefe is nothing
else, but the coniunction of the wicked
and the reprobate: this kinde of matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie
was of late veeres put in vre and
vse, by the sect of the Family of loue.</p>

cause, for the mutuall &amp; reciprocall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation

there is none so naturall, as that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene

all other societies are accused of free

not onely of election and free

of it appeareth by foure reasons.
First, matrimonie is auncient, as is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
by the time and place, where it
was instituted, and<note n="h" place="margin">Arist. li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Euerie good is so
much the more excellent, by howe much the

was sanctified by GOD, and graced
by his sonne our redeemer Iesus Christ
<pb facs="tcp:11841:98"/>
his presence,<note n="*" place="margin">Iohn 2.</note> 
                     <hi>at Cana a Citie in Galilee,

                     <hi>marriage,</hi> as Saint Paul writeth, <hi>is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
among all:</hi> and euerie honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
thing is more eligible then that,
which is not honourable. Fourthly, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonie
is excellent, because two are
better then one. Fiftly, matrimonie is
notable, because it carrieth with it a shew
of grauitie, and hath greater priuiled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges:
as in Florence at this day, he that
is father of fiue children, straightway vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the birth of the fift, is exempted
from all impostes, subsidies, and lones.
Also, heere in England, a married man is
not so soone prest into the warres as sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glemen
or batchelers. In a worde, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
within the rounde circle of this
world is comparable to matrimonie.

day was come, the bride was bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
<pb facs="tcp:11841:99"/>
to haue a chaplet of flowers or hearbes
vpon her head, and to weare a girdle of
sheeps wooll about her middle, fastned
with a true-loues knot, the which her
husband and must loose. Herehence rose the
Prouerbe: <hi>Hee hath vndone her virgins
girdle:</hi> that is, of a maide he hath made
her a woman. It is reported of some, that
the wife, as soone as shee was come to
her husbands house, presented to her
husband fire in one hand, and water in
the other: which gaue to vnderstande,
that as these two elements were most
necessarie of al others for conseruation
of mans life: so there could no societie be
neerer linked together, then that of the
husband and wife.</p>
                  <p>The auncient Frenchme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had a cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie,

they liued together afterwards as man

                  <p>In Scotla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the custome was, that the
lord of the soile should lie with the bride
before her husband. But because this

Christians, King Malcolme, the third
<pb facs="tcp:11841:100"/>

and enacted, that euerie bride thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foorth,
should pay to the Lord for ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
of her maiden-head, fiue shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings.</p>
                  <p>Marriages among the Gentlemen of
Venice, were for the most part conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
vpon by a third person, the bride
being neuer permitted so much as to see
her new husband, nor hee her, till their
nuptial dowrie was fully treated of &amp; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed;
which being finished, they were
married with great pompe &amp; solemnitie.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the ancient order of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages
in Turkie, they held it an vnde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
thing, for the bride to bee brought
home to her future husband with musi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
instruments, but they thought it
meete, that the married couple should
present themselues before God, with all
humilitie and reuerence: and after that
these ceremonies were ended, they were
led to their bed-chamber, which was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided
for them in a very secret and
darke place: the next morning at the

<pb facs="tcp:11841:100"/>
whether she can read or no. If she ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not,
then must he learne her to reade. In like
sort, if she can reade, and her husband
not, then must shee teach and instruct
him. This was the old maner of marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages
among the Turks. Howbeit, at this

voluptuousnesse, that they rather resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

                  <p>THe duties of a husband toward his
wife are 7. The first, that he<note n="*" place="margin">1. Pet. 3</note> 
                     <hi>giue ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to his wife, as the weaker vessell, for
she is partaker of the grace of life.</hi> The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
hee must patiently brooke the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinesse
of his wife, for there is nothing
in the world more spitefull then a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
if shee be hardly dealt withall, or
egged to indignation. Hence is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe:
<hi>Anger thy dogge, and hee will bite
thee.</hi> The third dutie,<note n="n" place="margin">Casus lib. 1. Thesaur. Oecono. cap. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>The husband in
any case must not haue carnall copulation
with any other but his owne wife, for that is
verie vniust, by reason it dissolueth the girdle
of faith and chastitie,</hi> &amp; is the next way to
cause her to hate him: a woman is iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
<pb facs="tcp:11841:102"/>
and naturally suspitious, and sith her
husband breaketh with her, she will not
sticke to breake with him, and priuilie
borrow a nights lodging with her neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.
The fourth dutie, the husband
must not iniurie his wife by word or
deede, for a woman is a feeble creature,
and not endued with such a noble cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
as the man; shee is sooner prickt to
the heart, or mooued to passions, then
man: and againe, he, that iniurieth his
wife, doth as if hee should spit into the
aire, and the same spittle returne backe
vpon his owne selfe. The fift, the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
in disputations with his wife, must
sometimes confesse himselfe vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
by her. The sixt, the husband must
prouide for his wife, and for her house<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeping,
according to his abilitie. The
seuenth, the husband must suffer his
wife to be merrily disposed before him,
otherwise (a womans nature is such) shee
will by stealth find out some secret place
or other to tattle in, and to disport her
self. The eight and cheefest dutie is, that
the husband haue a special regard not to
make two beddes, for so hee may take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
all causes of displeasure: also, if
<pb facs="tcp:11841:102"/>
eyther of them chaunce to iarre, by this
meanes they may be soone pacified.</p>

shee do what seemeth good in her

wiues in this wise:<note n="*" place="margin">1. Pet. 3</note> 
                     <hi>Let wiues be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
to their husbands:</hi> which is as much
to say, as they must not contradict them
in any point, but rather endeuour to
please them by all meanes. The second
duty, the wife must not forsake her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
in aduersity, or deride him, as Iobs
wife did, when shee bad him<note n="*" place="margin">Iob 2.</note> 
                     <hi>curse God
and die,</hi> but shee ought to comfort and
cherish him, as a part of her owne body.
The third, she must esteeme the maners
of her husband to be the legall rules of
her life. The fourth, she must not be too
sumptuous &amp; superfluous in her attire,
as, decked with frizled haire, embrode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
pretious stones, gaudy raiments, and
gold put about, for they are the forerun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of adultery:<note n="*" place="margin">1. Pet. 3</note> 
                     <hi>But let her haue the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
man in her heart, which consisteth in
<pb facs="tcp:11841:103"/>
the incorruption of a mecke and quiet spirit,
that is before God a thing much set by. For
euen after this maner in time past did the
holy women, which trusted in God, attire
themselues, and were subiect to their hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands.</hi>
The fift, shee must not bee iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
or mistrust her husbands absence.
The sixt duty of a wife is carefully to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersee
her household, and to bring vp
her children and seruaunts in the feare
of God. The seuenth, she must not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer
her husbands imperfections and
faultes to any, for by disclosing them,
eyther she makes her self a iesting stock,
or els she ministreth occasion for knaues
to tempt her to villany. The eight du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of a wife is, that she gibe not, nor flout
her husband, but beare with him as long
as she may.</p>

discusse. S. Paul saith, that the Lord
commaundeth the wife<note n="*" place="margin">1. Cor. 7</note> 
                     <hi>not to depart
from her husband: but and if shee do, then
be willeth her to remaine vnmarried, or bee
reconciled vnto her husband.</hi> In which
words might be made a doubt, whether
the Apostle meant the guiltlesse or guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
party. Howbeit, I find a defensiue
aunswere, namely, that hee meant the
guiltlesse wife, for this commaundement
<hi>(let not the wife depart from her husband)</hi>
implieth not this sence, to wit, <hi>let not the
wife be constrained as guilty to depart from

diuorcements; yea, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth

dependeth the glory of their

them may the more manifestly appeare,
I will set downe what they ought to do.
First of all, Parents must teach their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
to pray vnto God, to rehearse the
Creed, and the ten Commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dements,
and to catechize them in the chiefest
points of faith. Secondly, they must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware,
that they come not among such
felowes as sweare, curse, and such like,
and to that end they must place discreet
tutours ouer them. Thirdly, pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts must
breake them from their willes, &amp; correct
them sharply, when they offend (yet not

Fourthly, parentes must not permit
their children to weare gorgeous at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tires
or newfangled dresses, but rather
declare vnto them the vanity thereof.
Fiftly, parentes must procure them wise
and learned teachers, when they are
fit to go to schole. Sixtly, parentes must
not marre their children by marying
them, during their minorities, neither
cause them against their willes to bee
assured. Seuenthly, parentes must see,
<pb facs="tcp:11841:106"/>
that their children liue in vnitie, peace,
and concord; for if debate and discord
be pernicious among al men, how much
rather betweene brethren? Lastly, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
must ordinarily vse equality amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g
their children so neere as they may, and
not shew more affection to one then to
another, least thereby they prouoke the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  <head>Of Brotherly loue. Whether a man should
preferre his friend before his
brother? Chap. 13.</head>
                  <p>NOthing is more acceptable vnto the
Lord, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that brethren should loue
one another. The which vndoubtedly by
his soueraigne maiesty is ingrauen at
our birth, for we see the first occasion of
this amity to be bred euen from our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuity.
Therefore it is the duty of a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
not to bee angry or discouer the
faults of his brother. Further, it is the
part of a brother to loue his brother a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
all other, for he may daily get ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of this friendly mould, and more, if
these faile: but it is no more likely to get
a new brother, then to get an eye, which
is drawn out, or an hand, which is chopt
off. Hence springeth that question,
whether a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> should preferre his friend
before his brother? To this I aunswere
negatiuely, that he should not; and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
for these two reasons. First, we are
bound to follow nature, if she leades vs
not astray, (for who so euer followeth
nature, followeth God, by whome she is
<pb facs="tcp:11841:107"/>
directed) therefore we are bound to loue
our brethren aboue our friends, seeing
that by nature wee are chained with our
brethren, and whatsoeuer we bestow on
them, we bestow on our selues. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
soundeth that saying of the Poet:
<note n="a" place="margin">Hesiod. apud Plu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tarch. de fratern. amore.</note>
                     <hi>Take heed, that thou make not thy friend e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
with thy brother.</hi> Secondly, the loue
of brethren is better then the loue of
friends, for it includeth in it more then
the other; as for example, when friends
be at variaunce, we see nothing left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
them; but if brethren chaunce to
disagree, the knot notwithstanding of
brotherhood in despight of them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines
stedfast: moreouer, a man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
forsaken of all his parasitical friends,
is neuerthelesse of his brother, as it were
by a natural instinct receiued and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted.</p>
                  <p>To bee briefe, I exhort all brethren
to assist one another with mutuall loue,
&amp; not to beleeue any whispering make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates,
whose onely drift is to shift for
themselues, and to oppose not onely
friend against friend, but also for their
owne priuate good to put brother a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
brother. This exhortatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of mine
<pb facs="tcp:11841:107"/>
if brethren will embrace, let them assure
themselues, that they shall enioy the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity
of the celestiall Paradise, which is
already prepared for them.</p>

mighty battels being fought, the
victory alwaies inclined to the father, so
that the disobedient &amp; rebellious sonne
was enforced to desire peace, which the

him his offence. Howbeit notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
God the aue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger of such abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
factes punished him for his disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
by causing him to die 6. yeeres be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his father. A meet punishment (no
doubt) for him, seeing that he could not

tarie till after his fathers death. Further,
we heare, that there was of late daies a
certain man, that dwelt in a village neere
to Cambray, who in a great fury threw
his owne mother out of his house three
times in one day, and the third time told
her in anger, that he had rather see his

they must see that their seruaunts lie not

looke, that their seruaunts receyue their

touching diuine matters, not by car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,

if nothing else could moue you, yet the
daily myraculous punishments inflicted
on such prophane persons as you bee,
<pb facs="tcp:11841:111"/>
should bee a terrible warning for you.</p>
                  <p>At Kinstat a towne in France, dwelled
a certain couetous woman, about fortie
yeres ago, who was so eager in gathering
together worldly pelfe, that shee would
neither frequent the church to heare the
word of God on sunday her selfe, nor yet
permit any of her familie to do it, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
toyled about pilling and drying of
flaxe, neither would shee bee disswaded
by her neighbours fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> such an vnseaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
work. One sunday as she was thus
busied, fire seemed to fall downe among
the flaxe without doing any hurt. The
next sunday it tooke fire indeed, but was
soone quenched. For all this, shee conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
forwarde in her worke euen the
third Sunday, when the flaxe againe ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
fire, could not be extinguished, till
it had burnt her, &amp; two of her childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to
death; for though they were recouered
out of the fire aliue, yet y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> next day they
all 3. died, &amp; that which was most to be
wondred at, a yong infant in the Cradle,
was taken out of the midst of the flame,
without any hurt. Thus God punisheth
the breakers of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sabaoth. Famous is that
example, which chanced neere London
<pb facs="tcp:11841:112"/>
in the yeere of our Lord 1583. on the
thirteenth day of Ianuarie, being Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,
at Paris garden, where there met
together (as they were wont) an infinite
number of people, to see the beare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baiting,
without any regard of that high
day. But in the middest of their sports,
all the scaffolds and galleries sodainely
fell downe, in such wise, that two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
persons were crushed well nigh to
death, besides eight that were killed
forthwith.</p>
                  <p>In the yeere of our Lord 1589. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as then but a boy, do remember, that
an Alewife making no exception of
dayes, would needes brue vpon Saint
Markes day: but loe, the maruailous
worke of God, whiles she was thus labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
the top of the chimney tooke fire,
and before it could bee quenched, her
house was quite burnt. Surely, a gentle

                  <p>THe first dutie of seruants towardes
their masters is, that they be subiect

what is to be done, then their masters.
The second is, that they be honest and
faithfull vnto their masters, and not (as
many now a-dayes do) flatter &amp; cologue
with them, therby thinking to get some
bootie. The third duty of seruants is, that
they seeke their masters profit more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
their owne. The fourth, that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueale
not to others their masters secret
affayres. The fift, that they defend their
masters, euen to the hazarding and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of their liues. The famous effect
whereof, appeared in that couragious
seruant of Maurice, Duke of Saxonie;
who of late yeeres, seeing his master so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainely
assaulted by certaine Turks that
lay in ambush, and cast from his horse,
couered him with his owne body, &amp; va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liantly
repelled the enemie, vntill cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
horsemen came and saued the
Prince, but died himselfe a little while
after, being hurt and wounded in euerie
place of his body. Finally, to fill vp this
discourse, seruants must diligently and
honestly guard their masters, and their
masters goods: for<note n="r" place="margin">Pro. 27.</note>

price in those times was esteemed won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull

money coyned of leather was rise in this
Realme. Of which kinde of money my

in an olde castle in Wales, stam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped,
as farre as I remember, with the

coyne money. So likewise wee reade,
that countie Palatines, as Chester, Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,

concerning the pleas of the crowne, and
send writs in their owne names. In the
Kingdome of Cathay, money is yet nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of gold nor siluer, nor of any other

It is petie treason among them to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy

                  <p>Sir Thomas Moore reporteth, that
his faigned Vtopians did make cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber-pots,
<pb facs="tcp:11841:115"/>
and other vesselles, that serue
for most vile vses, of gold and siluer.
Moreouer, he saith, that they made great
chaines, fetters, and giues, wherein they
tyed their bondmen, of the very same
metals: and whosoeuer among them for
any offence was infamous, by his eares
hung rings of gold, about his necke was
a chaine of gold. Thus by all meanes
possible, they procured to haue gold
and siluer among them in reproach and
infamie. And if wee Christians examine
our selues somewhat more neere, wee
shall finde, that money is one of the
chiefest causes why so many felonies,
murthers &amp; treasons be committed, and
why the crie of the poore is so often
come before the Lorde. For this cause

by the Popes, who built most statelie

                  <head>Why houskeeping now-adaies is
decayed. Chap. 26.</head>
                  <p>THe causes, why hospitality is nowa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daies
brought to so low a saile, are
fiue. The first is ambition, which mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
Gentlemen, that are of large reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes,
to weare gorgeous attires, to
traile a costly port after them, to caua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liere
it abroad, and giuing vp house-ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
at home, to take a chamber in Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
where they consume their time in
viewing of stage playes, in carousing of
healths, &amp; (perhaps) in visiting of cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizans.
The second is hatred, which
pricketh Gentleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to fall out with their
neighbors, and to enrich the lawiers by
commencing of suites and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouersies.
The third is couetousnesse, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swadeth
<pb facs="tcp:11841:121" rendition="simple:additions"/>
landlords to hoord vp substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
for the Diuell, to enhaunce incomes, to
rayse rents (for feare least yeomen keep
better hospitality then themselues,) and
to conuert tillage into pastures. In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of which abominable abuse,
it was most prudently enacted in the
last Parliament, that all landes, which
were conuerted into sheepe pastures, or
to the fatting or grazing of cattell, (the
same hauing beene tillage lands) should
be before the first of May in the yeere
of our Lord 1599. last past, resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to tillage by the possessours thereof,
and so should continue for euer. It was
further enacted in the said Parliament,
that euery person offending against the
premisses aforesaid, should forfeit for
euery acre not restored the summe of
twenty shillings yeerely, as long as the
offence continued. The fourth reason,
why hospitality is caried to so lowe an
ebbe proceedeth of building; for soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
shall wee see a Gentleman build a
stately house, then giue almes, and che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
the needy. The fift and last cause
of the decay of hospitality is gluttony,
which enduceth men to prepare artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
<pb facs="tcp:11841:121" rendition="simple:additions"/>
cookeries &amp; diuers sorts of meate:
wheras one large and wholesome messe

wherefore did the Lord giue vnto many

doth very wel know, that wealth was not

giuen vs to hoord vp, no nor to consume
the same in superfluous vanities. Why
then do we keep our clothes in our pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,

wee misspend our goods in gaudy ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,

and in a thousand trumperies besides? oh
why do we not waigh in our minds, that
whatsoeuer wee spend more then wee
need, is none of ours, but the poores; &amp;
to detaine from them, is to pill and poll,
yea, and perforce to spoyle them. What
shall we say, when God will demaund an
account of our stewardships? Doubtles,
except wee do out of hand repent, and
giue almes, wee shall bee cast as a pray

                  <p>NEuerthelesse, I am of this mind, that
those men obserue not the true fast,
which hypocritically forgo a meale or

                  <p>Whosoeuer therefore is willing to

heretikes, flatterers, slau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derers, and such

his toung, and beware of blasphemies,
lies, and vngodly communications.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, he must fast with his mouth,
that is, he must take heed that he eat and
drinke no more, then sufficeth nature,
and that he abstaine from meats at con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient

illuminating al the world with his

                  </p>
                  <p>Moreouer, there bee foure forcible
reasons, which prooue that a Monarchy
ought to be preferred before all other
sorts of gouernments. First,<note n="r" place="margin">Iustin. ex lib. 1. Trog. Pompe.</note> 
                     <hi>from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of countryes and nations, the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement
was in the hands of Kings, who
were not extolled to that high degree of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie
by Ambition, but for their modestie,
which was knowne to all men.</hi> Likewise,
 <hi>that which is auncient and first<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ari. li. 3 Topicor. cap. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>is more
noble then that which is newfangled and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>
Secondly, the image of a monarchie
is found in priuate families. For the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of a father ouer his children, may
bee resembled to a royall gouernment,
because the Children are the fathers
charge: hee alone must prouide for
them, and their offences are by him
chastised. With which concurreth that
common speech: <hi>Euery man is a King in
his owne house.</hi> Thirdly, a Monarchie
hath continued aboue a thousand
yeeres; whereas the longest Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracie
and Democracie, haue not la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
aboue sixe hundred yeeres.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:11841:129"/>
Our Kingdome of Brittaine retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
a Monarchie, from the time that
Brutus first inhabited it, vntill Cad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>walader,
who was the last king of the
British bloud; which was aboue foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene
hundred yeeres. Then in the
yeere of our Lorde 574. the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
was diuided among seuen of the
Nobles, who still continued ciuill
warre one vpon the other, vntill Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert
in the yeere 800. reduced the
seuen prouinces into one whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.
Since which time there ruled
Princes as Monarches, vntill now this
yeere of our Lord, one thousand six hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred.
Whereby wee finde, that our
Monarchie hath alreadie lasted full
eight hundred yeeres. Scotland like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
hath endured in a Monarchie,
from the yeere of our Lord eight hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and twentie, Dungall then raig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
vntill this present yeere. Fourthly,
a Monarch carrieth a greater maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie,
whereby hee seemes gratious and
amiable in the sight of his subiects,
and dreadfull to his enemies. To
conclude, lette vs consent, that<note n="n" place="margin">Plato. lib. 1. de. leg.</note> 
                     <hi>a

Chap. 5.</head>
                  <p>THere are foure cheefe qualities ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie
for a Prince to maintaine his
reputation. The first is clemencie, to
forgiue trespasses. For as the Sunne,
when it is highest in the Zodiake, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
slowest: so the higher a Prince
is soared to greatnesse, the more gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
and meeke hee ought to bee to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes
his humble subiects. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
to imprint the lawes and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
of God in his minde, and to le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell
all his actions to the glorie of the
<pb facs="tcp:11841:132"/>
king of kings: as well for the health of
his owne soule, which hee ought to hold
dearer then his whole kingdome, yea,
then all the world: as for good ensam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
and imitation vnto his subiects. The
third is liberalitie, to succour poore scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
and souldiours; for as there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more common then the sunne,
that communicateth his light to all the
celestiall bodies, and chiefely to the
Moone, so a prince ought to impart part
of his reuenewes to the distressed, and
especially aboue the rest, to students &amp;
Souldiours. The fourth, to haue cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
and vertue to tolerate abuses. For

Caesar, it chanced that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth

that hee would not assume vnto
himselfe the name of King, because it
was odious vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but that he would
vse another title, vnder which they
would bee his loyall and obedient sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects.
Then Augustus being at that time
Generall, and therefore named Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
chose this title, to doe the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes
pleasure. So that Augustus Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar
was the first, that called himselfe by
the name of Emperour. The cause why
they hated the name of King, was by
reason that their forefathers in aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent

Tarquin for his tyrannies and rapes, had
forbidden by an edict and solemne
othe, the name of King euer after to be

mind bequeathed to the papacy. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore,
there be sixe tokens to know
a tyrant. The first, if hee sends abroad
pickthanks, talebearers, and espies to
hearken what men speake of him, as Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berius
the Emperour was woont to do.
The second, if he abolisheth the study
of learning, and<note n="*" place="margin">Tacit. in vita A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gricolae.</note> 
                     <hi>burneth the monuments
of most worthy wittes in the market place,
and in the assembly of the people,</hi> least his
subiects should attaine to the knowlege
of wisedome. As Alaricus king of the
Gothes did in Italy, in the yeere 313.
and the great Turke in his Empire.
The third, if hee maintaine schismes,
diuisions, and factions in his kingdome,
for feare that men should prie into his
doings. As the Popes haue done alway
from time to time: and of late daies the
<pb facs="tcp:11841:137"/>
Queene mother in Fraunce. The fourth,
if hee trust straungers more then his
owne naturall subiects; and continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
goeth garded with a strong compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny:
As Vortiger sometime king of this
Realme did, when he brought in Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gist
and the Saxons, and gaue them the
countreys of Kent and Essex to inhabit.
The fift, if he without cause co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand his
chiefest nobles to be cashiered &amp; bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
with ignominy, or to be imprisoned
and put to death, for feare lest they
should waxe too popular and ouermigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
Such a one was Frauncis Sfortia
Duke of Millain, that caused Alphonsus
king of Naples villanously at a banquet
to murther Earle Iames sonne to Nicho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las
Picinio (whome he had sent Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadour
to the sayd Alphonsus) for no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
cause, then for that hee feared his
might, &amp; because the Braciques in Italy,
&amp; some of his subiects highly esteemed
him. The sixt token to know a tyrant, is,
if he do away learned and wise men for
no other intent, then that fearing they
should reproue him, &amp; write against his
depraued &amp; vngodly life. As Domitius
Nero, that commaunded Seneca the

it, that we seldome heare of rebels, that
euer prospered, but in the end they were
bewrayed and brought to confusion. In
the time of Henry the fourth there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled
at one time against him the Duke
of Exceter, with the Dukes of Glouce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
Surrey, Aumarle, &amp; Salisburie: and

To come neerer the state of this
question, we find, that Leonagildus an
auncient king of the Gothes in Spaine,
both a tyrant and an Arrian in the yeere
of our Lord 568. pursued the true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
and exiled his own sonne, because
he was of the true religion. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
this young Prince being moued
at the persecution of the Christians in
his countrey, did twise raise armes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
his Lord and Father. At the first
<pb facs="tcp:11841:139"/>
he was taken captiue and banished; at
the second he was put to death on Easter
day. By which example wee may note
the effects of Gods iudgements, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke
the rashnesse of this Prince, that
rebelled against his soueraigne.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore, O yee that be subiect to

to obey, &amp; beware lest the same chance

That Aristocracy is best allowed, where
the gouernment is allotted to a few no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

this kind of commonwealth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

found imperfect &amp; farre inferiour. True
it is, that siluer and tinne are good, but

Now I will addresse my pen to write of
the honourable order in France.</p>
                  <p>King Lewes the eleuenth of France,
after he had made peace with his peeres,
whom in the beginning of his raigne, he
had excluded from his presence, inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
at Amboise, in the yeere of our Lord
1469. a societie of honour, consisting of
sixe and thirtie Noblemen, and named
Saint Michael Patron of them (euen as
the English knights had deuoted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
to the tuition of Saint George)
<pb facs="tcp:11841:146"/>
giuing ot each of them a golden chaine,
of the value of two hundred pound,
which they were bound to weare daily,
&amp; not to bestow, sell, or gage the same as
long as they liued; &amp; if any one of them
chanced to die, forthwith there was an
election to dubbe another in his roome,
not by voyces, but by litle scrowles tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
together in the forme of balles, the
which they did cast into a bason, and the
Lord Chauncelour was to reckon them.
Then he, that had most balles on his side
was admitted to the societie, the King
speaking these words: <hi>The honourable so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie
do accept of thee as their brother, and
in regard of their good wil to thee-wards, do
bestow this golden chaine on thee: God gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
thou maist long weare it.</hi> When the King
had spoken these words, hee gaue him a
kisse on the right cheek. This is the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome
of dubbing kinghts of the order
of Saint Michael.</p>
                  <p>Also, there be other orders of knights
in Christendome, as, the kinghts of the

knights of the patent deuised by <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

is profitable to a twofold scope, that the

                  <p>Infinite are the fooleries of youth,
which by due correction, and diligent
exhortation must bee rooted out. I will
therefore comprehend their education
vnder foure lessons.</p>
                  <p>The first is instruction, vnder which
are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tained foure rules. The 1. wherof
is, to teach children the feare and loue
of GOD, and to shew them, that they
must not glorie too much in worldly
goods. Secondly, to teach them, how
to bridle their tongues, to bee modest,
and to embrace vertue: for education
properly, is nothing else but a bringing
vp of youth in vertue. Thirdly, to
shew them the facultie of exercise,
<hi>which serueth to the maintenance of health
and strength,</hi>
                     <note n="z" place="margin">Arist. lib. 8. Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cor. cap. 3 &amp; 4.</note> 
                     <hi>by ordering the body with
light and gentle exercises.</hi> Fourthly, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly
to declare vnto them exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
<pb facs="tcp:11841:160"/>
as well of good men, as of wicked
men, that thereby they may learne how
the good are rewarded, and the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
punished.</p>
                  <p>The second lesson appertaining
to the instruction of youth, is prayse,
that is, to commende them, when
they doe well, that thereby they may
bee incouraged the better to goe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes.
For youth is like vnto moyst
and soft clay, and for that respect,
is to bee egged on to glorie in well do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>The third is counsell, which must
bee giuen by their sage Vncles, or
auncient men, concerning their dutie
towards their parents, elders, and tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers.</p>
                  <p>The fourth poynt of instruction is
threatning and correction, which is
to bee vsed, when they offend and
neglect to follow the aduice of their
teachers, and when they beginne to
bee headie, stubborne, and selfe-wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.
This the diuine Philosopher ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
well noted, saying: that<note n="s" place="margin">Plato Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alog. 7 de legib.</note>

himselfe to vertue, is a deceitfull,
<pb facs="tcp:11841:161"/>
cruell and a most proud beast.</hi> Wherefore
he must be bound with a schoolemaster
as it were with a strong bridle.</p>

                  <p>I Find that there bee foure causes, why
so few Gentlemen in this age, attaine
to the knowledge of vertue. The first is,
the corruption of the whole world: for
now are<note n="s" place="margin">Dan. 9.</note>

cogitations are too much bent to the
pompes and follies of this transitorie

counterfeit and vnsufficient teachers,
whose onely occupation is couertly to
woo yong scholers, that come guidelesse
and headlesse into the Vniuersitie: and
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

the niggardize of parents, who continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally

pelfe of this world, and in the
meane time make no reckoning of their
children, but permitte them to grow old
in follie, which destroyeth them both bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
and soule. The fourth and last cause,
is the indulgence and fond loue of the
parents, who take their sonnes from the
Vniuersitie, as fruite from a tree, before
it is ripe, or rather as pullets without fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
to place them at the Innes of
Court, where, as I haue written in my

out a good schoole-master, that will not
onely instruct them in learning, but also
informe them in the precepts of good
maners. Else, they imitate horsecoursers,
whose onely delight is, to pamper and

with a fond fantasie of that little which
they haue, that they tire and lie downe
in the midst of their bookish pride.
The consideration whereof, hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked
mee principally to require in a
schoole-master, morall and politique
Philosophie, thereby to instruct his
schollers in awe, obedience, and loue.

Withall, a schoolemaster must be endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with these nine qualities. First, hee
must be well skilled in Grammar, Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toricke,
and Poetrie. Secondly, hee
ought to haue discretion to iudge of his
scholers nature and disposition. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
courage to heartne and egge for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
a toward youth. Fourthly, perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance
not to giue ouer his schoole vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
enuie or grudge of some particular
person. Fiftly, hee must haue affabilitie
and courtesie, least his schollers as apes
taking example by his froward lookes,
become rough and disobedient. Sixtly,
hee must vse mediocritie in correcting,
that is, hee must correct them according
to the qualitie of their faults, and while
hee is so occupied, hee must not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uile
or nickname them. Seuenthly, hee
must bee endued with some maiestie of
countenance, and strength of bodie, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
hee will bee contemned, and
made a iesting-stocke. Eightly, with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinence,
to abstaine from lecherie and

                  <head>Whether it bee better for parents to keepe
their sonnes at home with a priuate
schoole-master, or to send them
abroad to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
schoole.
Chap. 37.</head>
                  <p>IN my iudgement this question is
worth the deciding, to wit, whether
Gentlemen should maintaine their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
at the free-schoole, or rather at
their houses, where they themselues
may ouersee their towardnesse? They
that approoue this priuate teaching, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadge
three speciall reasons. First, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
are by nature weake, and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
surprized with infectious diseases,
therefore they had rather haue them in
sight, where they may be tendred and
regarded; which is likewise confirmed
by that common saying: namely, <hi>The
masters eie fatneth his horse.</hi> Secondly, they
will learne modestie and ciuilitie at
home, whereas if they were abroad, they
would become rude, impudent, aud vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious.
Thirdly, they being in number
<pb facs="tcp:11841:166"/>
few, will be more diligently taught and
informed; which in a maner is impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in a common schoole, by reason of
the confusion of so many scholers.
Howbeit notwithstanding these rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
publike teaching seemeth to bee
of most force, and that for foure causes.
First, because<note n="h" place="margin">Ari. li. 8 Politic. cap. 1. Xenoph. li. 1. Paed. &amp; Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. li.</note> 
                     <hi>the wisest sort of men
haue preferred the publike instruction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the priuate.</hi> Secondly, a childe will
get wit and experience by conuersing
with many. Thirdly, when hee misseth
in his lesson, hee may in the common
schoole speedily recouer that which is
lost,<note place="margin">2. cap. 1.</note> by conferring with his mates.
Fourthly, if hee bee by nature melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholike,
crabbed, or wicked, hee will
in a free-schoole bee reformed, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for shame to bee beaten in the
sight of many, and partly for feare,
in seeing offenders punished. These
bee all the reasons which I can coniec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
on the behalfe of the publike schole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>master.</p>
                  <p>To knit vp this question of priuate
and publike teaching, this is my resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

                  <p>PArents in any case must not send
their sonnes to the Vniuersitie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they bee at least foureteene yeeres
of age: whither being once come, they
must curiouslie hearken (but not of
vnlearned persons and boyes, for they
measure mens sufficiencie by their
owne fancie) after a good Tutour,
that will not onelie furnish them
with necessaries, but also reade him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
vnto them: otherwise, the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
may one day repent them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

their sonnes education. For many
Tutours now-a-dayes will not sticke to
receiue a marke or twentie shillings a
quarter, for each of their scholers tuition,
<pb facs="tcp:11841:167"/>
and yet not vouchsafe once to reade
themselues vnto them, but to substitute
young Bachelers of Art, who, albeit
some of them can reade tolerably, yet
notwithstanding they cannot correct
and prouoke the sluggish, as wanting
both discretion to iudge, &amp; seueritie to
compell. It is therefore very prudently
decreed, although not alwaies executed,
by the Vniuersitie, that none should be
a Tutour, vnder a Master of Arts, &amp; yet
not euery Master, but such a one, that for
his integritie of life, and sufficiencie of
learning, is admitted by the Vicechan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celour,
the Head of the house, whereof
the Tutour &amp; the scholers are, &amp; by the
consent of two Doctours, or two Bache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
of diuinitie, to be a Tutour.</p>
                  <p>The qualities of a good Tutour bee
tenne: the first is, that hee bee godly
and vertuously giuen. The second,
that he be well seene in Humanitie and
Philosophie. The third, it is requisite
that he be no lesse then seuen &amp; twentie
yeeres of age, and no more then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
because the one lacks audacitie and
grauitie to commaund, and the other
most commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly is negligent. The fourth,
<pb facs="tcp:11841:167"/>
a Tutour must be sober aswell in words
as in deeds. The fift, he must not (as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
nowadaies do) suffer his pupilles to
be idle, and to haue their owne willes.
The sixt, he must chastise them seuere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
if they play at dice, sweare, fight, or
such like. The seuenth, he must (if hee
may possibly) haue them in his sight and
chamber. The eight thing required in a
Tutour is, that he be famous in the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersity
for his learning, and also well
friended, that thereby he may both sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
his scholers wantes, and looke that
they be not iniuried. The ninth duty of
a Tutour is, that hee haue an especiall
care and respect to his scholers battles,
lest that by permitting them to spend
what they please, he incurre the displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of the parents, and so hazard his cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit.
The tenth and last duty of a Tutour
is, that he keepe his scholers in awe and
obedience; and not too familiarly insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate
himselfe vnto them, seing that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the old adage, <hi>too much fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity
breeds contempt.</hi> And (in conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion)
whosoeuer giueth his scholers but
an inch, may be assured, that they will
(do what he can) take a whole ell.</p>

an excellent Poet, and yet of base li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage,

that best could honour the dead King:
among the rest, hee knowing that Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie

Poetrie. As for example, Iulius Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar

King of Arbia wrote a booke of preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

maried, how many children he had; and
which is most strange of all, hee would
finde out any thing which was hidden

But when diuisions and ciuill broyles

The Protestants were persecuted and
cruelly dealt withall in this Realme. And

                  <p>In the yeere 1572.<note place="margin">Anno 1572.</note> was seene towards

Parker Archbishop of Canterbury, and
<pb facs="tcp:11841:190"/>
sundry other. Pirats robbed and spoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

                  <p>In the yeere 1581.<note place="margin">Anno 1581.</note> appeared a Comet
bearding Eastward. Whereupon a little
while after, certaine co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panies of Italians

the Earle of Desmond in his rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,

and there erected their Antichrists ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner

                  <p>In the yeere 1583.<note place="margin">Anno 1583.</note> appeared another
Comet, the bush wherof streamed south<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>east.
But the effects thereof followed in

L. Hunsdon, &amp; L. Chamberlaine of her

Alphonsus Duke of Ferraria de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted

                  <p>In the beginning of the yeere 1598.
was seene a most fearfull Eclipse of the

neere to the Dragons head: the like
whereof was seldome heard off at any
<pb facs="tcp:11841:191"/>
time before: for the sunne was darkened
full eleuen poynts, which very neere is
the whole compasse of his body. The ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of it are these following.</p>
                  <p>Sigismund Prince of Transyluania,
not finding his power sufficient to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter
the Turks, voluntarily resigned
his dominion to the Emperour Rodolph
the second. The King of Swethland re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
into his Realme from Polonia,
had diuers conflicts and skirmishes with
his subiects. William Lord high Treasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
of England deceased. And so did
king Philip the second of Spaine, albeit
after a more strange maner. For it is cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibly
enformed, that this tyrant was ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
vp of lice and vermine. A punishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
no doubt befitting his vsurping life.
Rome was againe ouerflowne by the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
Tiber, whereby fifteene hundred
houses perished, and in a maner all
the Popes treasure was lost. Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall
Albert sent Mendoza Admirall
of Aragon, with his rascalitie, into the
Low Countries, where, vpon his owne
confederates of Cleueland, he hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised
many bloudy tragedies. Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore
Duke of Muscouie ended his life.
<pb facs="tcp:11841:192"/>
There was a great deluge of waters in
Hungarie. The Turks had wonderfull
bad lucke vpon the seas. The vnited
States of the low Countries sent a huge
fleete into Spaine, where they had verie
good successe, to the vtter vndoing of
many a Spaniard. What shall I write of
the terrible rumours of warres, which
were noysed throughout all England
this last summer? Assuredly these enents
were foreshewed vnto vs by the horrible
Eclipse, which appeared now aboue two
two yeeres agoe. Since which time I
waited continually for some notable ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
or other: neither could my mind o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
presage, but that such things
would come to passe, which now (GOD
be thanked) are ouerpast. This after a
sort, I communicated at that time to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
Ia. Pr. an auncient wise gentleman,
and a deare kinsman of mine, at whose
house, I as then being lately come into

soiourned. God grant vs better and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier

                  <head>Of the causes of sedition and ciuill
broyles. Chap. 54.</head>
                  <p>THere be sixe causes of sedition. The
first and chiefest is the contempt of
religion. For if men loued God, which
they cannot doe, except they loue their
neighbour, doubtlesse no such effects
would follow from their actions.<note n="a" place="margin">Esay. 2.</note> The
loue of religion <hi>breaketh swords into
mattocks, and speares into sithes,</hi> and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
that<note n="i" place="margin">Micha. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>nation shall not lift vp sword a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
nation, neither learne to fight any
more.</hi> The second cause of sedition is the
factions of the subiects, which euer haue
beene, and euer will bee the subuersion
of estates. The third cause is riotous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speritie:
for ouer-great aboundance of <hi>wealth, is the prouocation of mischiefes,</hi>
                     <note n="x" place="margin">Ouid. lib. 1. Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morph.</note> and
maketh men to become diuels. The
fourth is, when the Prince ouerchargeth
his subiects with tributes, and when
hee substituteth niggardly and deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Treasurers and Lieutenants to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
the leuied money, that will not
<pb facs="tcp:11841:193"/>
sticke to detaine a part thereof for their
owne priuate gaine. The first cause of
Sedition is iniquitie:<note n="a" place="margin">Arist. li. 5. Politic. cap. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>as, when that which
is due by proportion, is not giuen to them
that bee equall;</hi> and when the Prince be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoweth
honour, which is the hire and
guerdon of vertue, vpon raw and meane
men. This was one of the originall cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of the late troubles in France, when
the Queene mother, for the establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of her regencie, dubbed simple
Gentlemen knights of the honourable
order of Saint Michael, first instituted
by King Lewis the eleuenth, and til that
time held in great estimation. The sixt
cause of sedition is, when the Prince
winketh at the cosonages of magistrates
and Lawyers, and permitteth some of
the richer sort to enclose commons, and
to rake their inferiors out of measure.</p>

Howbeit, hee neuer enioyeth his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised

let vs bethinke with our selues the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull
prouidence of God, in discouering
the hainous treasons pretended against
our dread soueraigne Queen Elizabeth.
Of late yeeres, namely, in the yeere
1588. what befell to Tilney, Sauage,
Babington, and the rest of their cursed
complices? were they not all executed,
&amp; brought to confusion? Likewise Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour
Lopouze, the Queenes Phisicion,
who had poysoned sundry Noblemen of
this Realme, and by the Spanish Kings
procurement, went about to poyson the
Queene her selfe, had he not in the yere
1594. his deserued punishment? Euen
so the last yeere one Squire, by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stigation
<pb facs="tcp:11841:194"/>
of a Spanish Frier, going about
to do away her Maiestie, was surprized in
his treason, and executed to the terrour
of all such diuelish traitours.</p>
                  <p>Be therefore better admonished, yee

Fourthly,<note n="i" place="margin">August. in Epist. 64. ad Maced.</note> the holy fathers of the church

Dice-play is condemned by the lawes

all such as played at dice were bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed

                     <hi>Dice-players should

this Realme decreed, that euerie Dice-player
should be imprisoned two yeres,

the seuenth enacted, that Dice-players
should bee imprisoned one day, and
that the keeper of the gaming house

                  <p>In the yeere of our Lord 1550. one
Steckman of Holsatia hauing lost much
money at dice, fell into despaire, and
therewithall killed three of his children,
and would haue hanged himselfe, if his
wife had not preuented him. Likewise in
the yere 1553. one Schetrerus playing
at dice in an ale-house neere to Belisan,
a towne in Heluetia, blasphemed God.
Wherupon the diuell came in place, and
carried him away. Also, my selfe haue
knowne a wealthie yeoman, that was as
great a dicer, as any other in that shire
where he dwelt, and (I thinke) had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
wel-nigh a thousand pound by that
his occupation: but what became of him
and his wealth? marrie, he bathing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
in a riuer, was sodainely drowned:
and his sonne, to whom his goods after
<pb facs="tcp:11841:196"/>
his death did rightly appertaine, before
3. yeeres were expired, spent al at dice,
and at this day is glad to stand at mens

see, that dice-players neuer thriue?
and if perhaps one amongst a thousand
chance to winne, notwithstanding at last
he loseth all, &amp; so may put his winnings
in his ere, yea, and which is worse, hee
hazardeth his soule, which hee ought to
hold more deare then all the world. But
because I haue largely confuted this

Chap. 58.</head>
                  <p>IN the beginning of the world, men
were clothed with pelts and skins of
beasts: wherby is to be noted, that they
were become as beasts, by transgressing
the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement of God, touching the
fruit in Paradise. Apparell was not
giuen to delight mens wanton eies, but
to preserue their bodies from the cold,
<pb facs="tcp:11841:197"/>
and to couer their shame. They had no
Beuer hats sharpe on the top, like vnto
the spire of a steeple, nor flatte crownde
hats, resembling rose-cakes. They wore
no embrodered shirtes, nor garments
of cloth of gold. They knew not what
meant our Italianated, Frenchified, nor
Duch and Babilonian breeches. They
bought no silken stockins, nor gaudie
pantoffles. Their women could not tel
how to frizle and lay out their haire
on borders. They daubed not their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
with deceitfull drugs, wherewith, hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the handi-work of God, they might
seeme to haue more beautie, then hee
hath vouchsafed to giue them. They imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
not Hermaphrodites, in wearing
of mens doublets. They wore no chaines
of gold, nor ouches, iewels, bracelets,
nor such like. They went not clothed in
veluet gownes, nor in chamlet peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cotes.
They smelt not vnto pomanders,
Ciuet, Muske, and such like trumperies.
And yet for all that, they farre surpassed
vs in humanitie, in kindnesse, in loue,
and in vertue. Their onely cogitations
were bent to decke the inward mind, &amp;
not the outward body, which is nothing
<pb facs="tcp:11841:197"/>
els, sauing a liuing sepulcher. They knew
that if the mind were humble and lowly,
the raiment for the body must bee euen
so. Euerie seede bringeth forth herbes
according to his kind: as time seed brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
foorth time, and tare seede tare.
Such as the heart is, such is the body; if
the heart bee proude, the fruit thereof
will be ill weedes, and proud attires. But
why is the earth &amp; ashes proud? to what
end will our fine apparell serue, when
death knocketh at out doores, and like a
theefe in the night surprizeth vs vna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares?
Our yong gallants, when they
hire a chamber in London, looking dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to bee sent for home by their parents,
will neuer trouble themselues with any
charges or garnishing it, as otherwise
they would doe, if they were assured
longer to continue in it. And what, I
pray you, is the body, but a chamber lent
to the soule, wherehence it expecteth
continually to bee sent for by God our
heauenly father, and (as Saint Paul spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth)
<hi>to bee loosed, and to be with Christ?</hi>
For what cause doe wee take such care
to apparell the body, seeing within a
while after it must putrifie, and returne
<pb facs="tcp:11841:198"/>
to the dust of the earth, from whence it
came? what reason haue wee to neglect
the soule, which neuer dieth? why do we
not follow King Henrie the sixt of this
Realme, who when the Earle of War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wicke
asked him wherefore hee went so
meanely apparelled, answered, <hi>It behoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
a Prince to excel his subiects in vertue,
and not in vesture?</hi> Let vs call to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance

why she went not (as other matrons) at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired

king Richard the second beyng their
Soueraigne: but they were discomfited,
<pb facs="tcp:11841:201"/>
and the most part of them sharply puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed.
Likewise in the yeere 1484. a
great commotion was moued by the
commons of the North, by reason of a
taxe, which was imposed vpon them of
the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>th peny of all their lands &amp; goods.
But their rash attempt was speedily bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
and their ringleaders hanged at

all such rash reuoltings, and therewithall
consider, how detestable they are in the

respect must be had, lest the innocent be

Fourthly, the Prince must a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand
remoue munitions and artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries
out of the way, &amp; put them in safe
custody. In so doing he shall find the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious

he must be well experienced, that he
may see how the enemy lieth, what

or to defend himselfe. Fiftly, a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
must be witty and well spoken,
because souldiers minds will be sooner
inflamed to fight by sweet exhortations,
then by all the trumpets in the world.

called in the Saxons to helpe him, who

                  <head>How the enemy is to be vanquished.
Chap. 70.</head>
                  <p>WE must obserue twelue rules, before
we discomfit our enemies. Wherof
<pb facs="tcp:11841:207"/>
the first is, that wee aske forgiuenes of
God for our misdeedes, and feruently
beseech him to goe before our armie.
The second is, that the Captaine Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
forbid all blasphemies, swearing, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing,
rioting, and such like impious do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.
The third, that none but wise men
beare office in the campe. The fourth
way to ouercome the enemie, is to bee
well prouided of necessaries. The fift,
Captaines must not enuie one another.
The sixt, niggardly and corrupt offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
must bee seuerely punished. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth,
our warriours must make no long
delay in the enemies country: especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
if the climat therof be contagious and
noysome. The eight meanes to obtaine
the victorie ouer our foes is, not to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
any to straggle abroad and rob, lest
meeting with ambushes, they bee vna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares
surprized. The ninth, Marchants,
on paine of death, must not transport a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
newes, prouision, or commodities in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the enemies coast. The tenth, valiant
men must bee nobly recompenced for
their aduenturous acts. The eleuenth
rule, to haue a fresh supply alwaies at a
becke; and for that purpose, some of the
<pb facs="tcp:11841:208"/>
best experienced Captaines must be left
behind, to conduct the rawest sort, and
to traine them vp in martiall discipline.
The twelfe and last obseruation is, that
all transgressors be rigorously chastised,
to the terrour and ensample of others.</p>
