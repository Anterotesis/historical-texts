            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Uch is the most bloudy, and most blasphemous impudencie of these
Romish Incendiaries, that when they put on a divellish and despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
resolution, to murther any Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, King, or Prince whom they have once
pronounced to be an Hereticke, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate person; and thereupon intend
to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther him by some <hi>Raviliack,</hi> whom they make choice of for the
execution of the said Treason; that after such an unfortunate and wretched
person, is once allured, and entred into their place of consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, or
chamber of (Philonicall) prayers, (for <pb n="4" facs="tcp:48250:3"/> sooth) as they call
them: These infernall firebrands kneele all downe, who in their prayers observe
their time; and put before the intended Traitor, a knife folded up in a scarfe;
shut up in a little Box, covered with an <hi>Agnus Dei;</hi> written about with
black letters of perfumes, odorifirous Characters: and when they draw it out
themselves, they cast or sprinckle some drops of holy water upon it, and which
done, they hang at the hafte of the said knife, five or six graines of Corrall,
which are blessed by them, who blaspheamously they give him to understand, and
make him beleeve that so many blowes, as shall be given by him with the said
knife; so many soules shall be released out of Purgatorie.</p>
            <p>Afterwards, putting the knife into the intended Murtherers hand,
they pronounce these words say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:</p>
            <p>Goe now like <hi>Iephte,</hi> with the Sword of <hi>Sampson</hi>
in thy hand, the Sword with which <hi>David</hi> did cut off <hi>Golia's</hi>
head, the Sword of <hi>Gedion;</hi> yea, the Sword with which <hi>Iudith</hi>
did cut off <hi>Holophernes</hi> head, the sword of the valiant
<hi>Machabees,</hi> and the same with which Saint <hi>Peter</hi> did cut off
<hi>Malcas</hi> his eare, yea I say, the sword of Pope <hi>Iulius</hi> the
second, with the which (breaking the forces of oppugning Princes) he tooke out
of their hands with great effusion of blood, the Citties of <hi>Sezza, Imola,
Fayance, Bolog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> and many other Cities: goe thus I say, thou magnanimous
Champion of the chaire of Rome, and be valiant, and God strengthen thine arme
for the great worke now intended by thee. After which, this infernall kennell
of Romish blood-hounds <pb n="5" facs="tcp:48250:3"/> kneele all downe, and the most
wretchedly renowned and cursedly quallified amongst them, with a caute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized
conscience and immarbled heart, pronounceth the bloody Conjuration, impiously
and impudently saying as followeth.</p>
            <p>Come Cherabims, come Seraphinns, and highest Thrones that rule,
come blessed Angels: yea, bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Angels of charitie, come and fill this holy
Vessel with glory and eternity, and bring him presently the Crowne of the
Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> of the Patriarches, and of the Martirs, for he belongeth
no longer to us, but to you.</p>
            <p>And thou Oh dreadfull and terrible God, who hast revealed to him
in these our Prayers and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations; that he ought to murther a Tyrant, and
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found a Hereticke, and to give the Crowne to a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike-King. And being
by us disposed to this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious Murther, vouchsafe to fortifie his senses,
and increase his forces: to the end that he may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish this thy great
will; and vouchsafe to arme and furnish him with the Harnesse of thy powerfull
providence, that he may valiantly performe the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy worke he hath piously
undertaken, and may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily escape from those, who would apprehend him: give
him Eagles winges, that the spight and malice of those Barbarians whom hee goes
against, may not once touch his sanctified members. Extend also the beames of
thy joy and coelestiall felicitie upon his sacred soule, to the end that by the
blessed influence thereof, the parts and members of his body also; may be
encouraged and enabled to this great worke, and that it may chearefully dispose
it selfe to this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <pb facs="tcp:48250:4"/> Combate without feare or shrinking
pusillanimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
            <p>This accursed Conjuration being thus audacious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and gracelessely
uttered, they carry the thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanted bloody Regicide, and set him before an
Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, where they shew him a Picture wherein the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels are seene and showne
to have lifted up and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated long since <hi>Iames Clement,</hi> a bloody
Iacobine Fryer, and represented him (as it were) before the Throne of God,
saying:</p>
            <p>Lord behold thy Pupill, behold thy well-instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted Champion, and
the accomplisher of thy justice: Whereupon all the Saints rise out of their
seates to make him roome, and give him place among them. And when all these
things are thus done and finish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, there are no more but foure Iesuites only
left with him, who when they come neare him; they with diabolicall impudencie
and lying flatterie, say unto him: that they seeme to perceive that there is
some Diety infused into him, and that they are so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stonished with the radiant
light-shining and gliste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in him, that they hold it their honour to kisse
his hands and feete, and make him madly to beleive that they account him not a
meere man any longer; but that they esteeme themselves (as it were) as they
say, halfe unworthy of the happinesse and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry which hee hath already
obtained by his Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke resolution, and sighting deepely before him: they
say unto him; we would that God had chosen us, and called us to your estate:
since we should be truly assured, that we should goe really, and direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into
Paradice without comming at Purgatorie. <pb n="7" facs="tcp:48250:4"/> And thus having
