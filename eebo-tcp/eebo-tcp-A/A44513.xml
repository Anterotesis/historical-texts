         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE following Discourse being the substance
of several Sermons, Preach'd at your desire,
and incouragement, before the Monthly Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,
though I am ignorant who you are, and what
part of the City or Country you live in, yet I thought it
my Duty, to let the Publick know, that there is such a
Man in the World, who is desirous to do good, and loves
not to be known. This Treatise you have a proper Title
too, not only as one, whose Hearts desire is to see the
<hi>Church of England</hi> flourish, but as a <hi>Benefactor</hi> too;
and to have Dedicated it to any other Person, had been
injurious to your Character.</p>
            <p>You were sensible how backward the generality are to
come to the Holy Communion, how much ground the
Church, and Christianity it self, loses by this stupid
negligence of it's pretended Votaries, and how, not a
few absent themselves, for want of understanding the true
nature and design of this <hi>Blessed Sacrament,</hi> and
therefore justly thought, that if, by a previous Monthly
Sermon, Mens Hearts were warm'd into consideration
of the Use and Necessity of this Ordinance, the Mists,
<pb facs="tcp:103387:3"/>
which hitherto have clouded their Vnderstandings,
would be dispell'd, and they become acquainted with
their Du<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y, which was the cause of your exciting me to
this Publick Service.</p>
            <p>Your Judgment hath not fail'd you, for since these
Religious Exercises have been among us, abundance of
Persons, who before look'd upon their coming to the
Holy Table, either as indifferent, or unnecessary, or
unseasonable, have, through the Blessing of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought
themselves, considered the Obligations, that
the mighty Work of Redemption lays upon them, and
conscientiously applyed themselves to the frequent Use of
this <hi>Universal Medicine.</hi> And all I can tell you
for your incouragement, is this, That as we owe the
beginning, and progress of these Monthly Sermons,
to your Zeal and Influence, so you will have a share,
both in the good that's done by them, and in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
of those, who are thereby brought to a serious
sense of the wonderful Love of God in Christ Jesus. It
was a publick good you design'd by your munificence;
and that which makes the Pious Work the greater, is,
that you do not care your left hand should know what your
right hand doth.</p>
            <p>The Almighty hath enrich'd your Heart with the
Noblest Charity, even with that to the Souls of Men,
an Empl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>yment which God himself disdains not to
travel in; and what are all the Angels of Heaven,
but Ministring Spirits, sent forth to be helpful unto
those that shall be Heirs of Salvation?</p>
            <p>Nothing is more pleasing to God, than to be instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
in <hi>bringing many Sons unto Glory,</hi> and
though you are no publick Orator, yet you help towards
Mens Conversion, and in employing others to rouze
them from their Spiritual slumber, your Self have a
<pb facs="tcp:103387:3"/>
hand in their Reformation; And by that means Preach,
though you be not in Orders, yet without offence to the
Law, and at the same time observe the Canons of the
Church, and win Souls, without being engaged in the
Sacred Function. Some <hi>Criticks</hi> think, that <hi>S. Paul,</hi>
in his Address to the <hi>Athenians,</hi> doth not find fault
with, but commends them for Erecting an Altar <hi>To
the unknown God,</hi> and if so, I hope none will
blame me for raising this Monument, <hi>To an unknown
Benefactor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Good Works are the sweetest Incense that can be
laid upon God's Altar; and though some, that have
concealed their Names, have been discover'd by the
Charitable Deeds done by them, yet yours are so order'd,
that, though for some time you have thus generously
employ'd part of your means, to advance this publick
Good, yet still you are a stranger to me; and in that,
happier than the <hi>Roman Senator,</hi> who
hiding himself in the time of Proscription,<note place="margin">L. Plotius.</note>
his Perfumes betrayed him.</p>
            <p>May the God, and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
who hath already touch'd your Heart with a sense of his
Glory, enrich you with all Spiritual Blessings, and make
you to abound more and more in Faith, in Love, and
in all Goodness. May that Great Shepherd of Souls en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten
your Understanding with greater brightness,
raise your Soul above this transitory World, teach you to
despise the things that are seen, and fill you with earnest
longings, after those which are not seen; that after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
serv'd your Generation here, your Immortal part
may be admitted to the Enjoyment and Embraces of the
Holy Trinity, the Festivals of <hi>Seraphim,</hi> to Mount
<hi>Sion,</hi> to the City of the Living God, to the innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Company of Angels, to the general Assembly of
<pb facs="tcp:103387:4"/>
the First-born, which are written in Heaven, to the
Spirits of Men made perfect, and to <hi>Jesus</hi> the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator
of the New Testament, whose Blood speaks better
things than that of <hi>Abel.</hi> So wishes,</p>
            <closer>

            <head>THE
PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE vast number of Books about the
<hi>Sacrament</hi> of the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> as it shews
the richness of the Subject, so it disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
the Zeal and Industry of good Men, to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
the power of Religion in these <hi>perilous times,</hi>
as they are call'd by the <hi>Apostle of the
Gentiles.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 1.</note> And indeed, if we consider
the influence this Ordinance hath <hi>yet</hi> on Men,
who have not altogether sold themselves to do
Evil, and are not gone so far, as to make a mock
of Religion; it is no small motive to busie our
selves in recommending and pressing the frequent
use of it. I look upon it as a special Providence
of God, that in this Iron Age, wherein Men
have made a shift to baffle all the Rules of Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
they have yet some Reverence for this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance;
insomuch, that if we can oblige them to
make use of it, we may entertain great hopes of
their future sobriety and seriousness: The gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
shun it, because they are loth to shake
hands with their looser lives, and they are sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
that the use of this Ordinance, and a disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
Conversation, are things inconsistent, and
<pb facs="tcp:103387:5"/>
incompatible; and therefore, could we perswade
them to come, we might promise our selves a
rich and plentiful Harvest, there being nothing
more likely, than the fruitfulness of that Ground,
which is water'd with the <hi>Blood of Jesus.</hi> What I
publish here, is in order to make good my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
in a lesser Piece, call'd <hi>The Fire of the Altar;</hi>
and when a Man hath once, either rashly, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meditately,
made himself a Debtor to the Publick,
I think it is Justice and good Manners, if he be
able, to discharge the Obligation. I do not here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
discourage the Reader, from perusing other
Mens Labours, (He'll possibly think there is no
danger) but desire only to promote and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
the good he reaps from exacter Composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
I have, in the following Discourse, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd
at once, to inform the Readers Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to direct his Practice, and to satisfy his
Curiosity; the first, by giving a rational account
of the Nature of the <hi>Eucharist;</hi> the second, by
taking notice of the particular Duties requisite
in Communicants; and the third, by adding
some Historical passages about the rise and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress
of some Rites, and Opinions, relating to
this <hi>Sacrament.</hi> I had Thoughts toward the latter
end, to have added a Chapter about <hi>Confessing of
Sin</hi> to a Faithful Minister of God's Word, before
Men receive the Communion; but fearing the
Book would swell to an unconscionable bulk,
I was forc'd to stop where I did. That which
made me desirous to have said something of that
Subject, was, because I find by converse, that
some <hi>Romish Priests</hi> have of late been very busie
with several Members of our Church, and made
<pb facs="tcp:103387:5"/>
a mighty stir about this Sacramental Confession,
as if our Church were defective in a Fundamental
Point, because we press no such thing upon our
Communicants. But not to mention, that <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tebanks</hi>
do what they can to discourage Men from
consulting with discreet and rational <hi>Physicians;</hi>
we do not, indeed, make this <hi>Confession of sins to
a Minister</hi> absolutely necessary to Salvation, nor
do we enjoyn it upon pain of Damnation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
we have no warrant for it in Scripture,
which our Church makes the only Rule of her
Faith; but that we do not encourage this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
as a thing very convenient, nay, in some
cases necessary, especially, where the Sinners
Conscience is burden'd, and oppress'd, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
under doubts, is a malicious Slander and
Calumny. We find nothing in the Apostles <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick</hi>
for Celebrating the Holy Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. v. 28.</note>
concerning this Confession. But
all that he saith, is this, <hi>Let a Man examine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and so let him eat of that Bread, and drink of
that Cup;</hi> which Christians may certainly do,
without Confessing their Sins to a Minister. Yet
where they are gravel'd in this Examination, or
find themselves in perplexity about their Spiritual
concerns, Reason requires, that they should come
to the <hi>Priest,</hi> who is appointed by God, as <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector</hi>
of their Consciences, and where <hi>we</hi> find,
that their Souls are touch'd with remorse, and
their resolution is great and magnanimous, to
shake off the burthen of their Pollutions, and to
give themselves up to the conduct of a better
Master, there we are ready to impart to them
that Absolution, which God hath bid us pronounce
<pb facs="tcp:103387:6"/>
in his Name to their Comfort, and whereof there
is as full, and satisfactory a <hi>Form</hi> in our <hi>Liturgy,</hi>
as any Christian can desire. It's granted, we do
not, as in the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> join the Merits of
the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> and of the <hi>Saints,</hi> to those of
<hi>Christ,</hi> in our Absolution, because we dare not,
for fear of committing a hainous Sin; but we
Absolve, as far, as we are impowred by the Word
of God, and he that leaves this Fountain, and
hews out to himself Cisterns, which can hold no
Water, is in danger of being forsaken by God,
and left to his own Delusions, and vain Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations.</p>

of old, as <hi>Caesar</hi> tells us, having made their
Sacrifices, the Testimony of their Union,
whenever any of their People did obstinately disobey
their orders, the Punishment they inflicted on them, was,
to interdict them the Use and Participation of their
Sacrifices; and whoever fell under this Censure, was
counted Criminal and impious; his Company, Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
and Conversation, shunn'd as the Plague; and he
depriv'd of the Benefit of the Law, and look'd upon
as infamous and scandalous. Such visible Badges the
Son of God, when he left the Earth, thought <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> to give
to the Christian World, to be Witness of their Union
and Communion, <hi>viz. Baptism</hi> and the <hi>Supper of the Lord;</hi>
the former, as a Mark of their being admitted into his
Church; the other, to advance and increase that Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Life, of which the former may be supposed to have
sown the Seed, and laid the happy Foundation; and
and though all that come and apply themselves to the
use of these Ordinances, are not therefore true Members
of his Church, or lively Stones in that Spiritual Building
yet as these Mysteries, and frequenting of them, are
standing Witnesses of their having addicted themselves
and vow'd obedience to Christ's Religion; so they are
means, whereby they may not only arrive to a lively
sense of their Duty, but whereby their Union and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
may be promoted, and proclaimed to all that
are without the Pale of Christian Congregations. And
were the ancient Discipline of the Church revived, and
reduced to its former lustre and glory, we may ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
<pb facs="tcp:103387:7"/>
conclude, that to be deprived of the use of these
two especially of the latter, would be more infamous
and grievous, than it was among the Heathen to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
from the participation of their Sacrifices; as the
Benefits, of which people are deprived thereby, are of
greater consequence and concernment, than those, which
the Pagans expected from their unreasonable Service.</p>
            <p>II. As to the <hi>Sacred Rite of Distributing and Participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of Bread and Wine,</hi> universally practised in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Church, and which is the proper subject of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing
Discourse, the reason why it is called the <hi>Lords
Supper,</hi> is,</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Because the Lord of Lords, and King of Kings, he
whose Name is Wonderful, The Lord</hi> Jesus Christ <hi>hath so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly
instituted, vnd ordained it.</hi> It was the fatal night,
when the <hi>Jews,</hi> prompted by the Prince of Darkness,
and blind with rage and envy, were come out against
him, as against a Thief, with Staves and Spears, to hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
him to Death and to the Cross; just before this ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
<hi>Tragedy</hi> began, having eaten the Passover with his
Disciples, and by so doing put an end to the Types and
Shadows of the <hi>Ceremonial Law,</hi> he took Bread and
Wine, and gave it to all the Church then present, and
bid them eat and drink of it, and in so doing, have high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
thoughts, and reflect upon all the instances of his
Love to their Immortal Souls, and teach their Successors
to do so too. This <hi>Jesus who by wicked hands
was Crucified,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 2. 36.</note> 
               <hi>and whom God hath made both
Lord and Christ,</hi> was the Master and Author
of this Feast, and from him it justly derives its Name.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Because the end of this Eating and Drinking is to
Commemorate the Death of the Lord Jesus.</hi> As the end of
the <hi>Passover,</hi> under the Law, was, to remember the
great Deliverance from the <hi>Egyptian Bondage;</hi> and that
of the <hi>Feast of Tabernacles,</hi> their being guided through
the Wilderness by a Cloud, and their Ancestors dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:103387:8"/>
Booths and Tents: As the <hi>Feast of Trumpets</hi> was insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
either by way of Anticipation, that they might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
afterwards how the Walls of <hi>Jericho</hi> fell, or
to refresh their Minds with <hi>Isaac</hi>'s Sacrifice, (an Emblem
of the <hi>Messiah</hi>'s Death;) and the <hi>Feast of Weeks,</hi> or <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecost,</hi>
was ordained as a Testimony of their Gratitude
for a Plentiful Harvest, and to put them in mind of the
Liberty they gain'd, when God gave them the Law,
and entred into a Covenant with them; and that of
<hi>Purim</hi> to bring into their Memories, how they were
rescued from the cruelty of <hi>Haman</hi> the <hi>Amalekite;</hi> and
that of the <hi>Dedication,</hi> to suggest to them the Rebuild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Temple: So the Lord Jesus enjoyn'd and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
the keeping of <hi>this Feast</hi> to his Followers, that
they might remember, how their Master loved them,
and made his Death a demonstration of Love; how he
died to make them happy, and denied himself in all the
Contents of Life, to make theirs blessed and glorious for
ever; how he submitted to the Power of the Grave,
to purchase their comfortable Resurrection, and fell a
Sacrifice, that they might have hopes of Pardon through
his Blood; a Remembrance so just, that if this Charity
deserves not frequent Commemoration, no Mercy, no
Benefit, no Favour, no Providence can deserve it, for
this goes beyond all, that the Word of God calls glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and beneficial to Mankind.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Its the Lord's Supper, because the Lord Jesus is Meat
and Drink in this Feast;</hi> Meat <hi>indeed,</hi> and Drink <hi>indeed,</hi>
as the expression is, <hi>John 6. 11.</hi> for though that Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
speaks not directly of this Supper, yet the Phrases
and modes of speech used there, may very piously be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
to what is represented by the Elements in this Feast;
for the Benefits, Advantages and Emoluments of Christs
Death, are Food so proper to a Religious Soul, and a
gracious Mind feeds so savourly upon these, that nothing
deserves the name of Spiritual Meat and Drink, so
much as these; and indeed, these nourish and feed the
Soul, make her strong and lively; these are her Cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:103387:8"/>
and Restoratives, and in the nature of <hi>David</hi>'s Oyl,
<hi>Psal. 104. 15.</hi> which <hi>make her Face to shine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. <hi>It's the Lords Supper, because the nourishment and strength
it affords or yields, is by the influence of the Lord Jesus.</hi>
He sends his Spirit into the Soul, that comes to his
Feast hungry and thirsty, and longing after the Riches
of Gods Love, whereby the Soul is inflamed to love
him, who bought her at this dear rate; and that love
produces Peaceableness and Gentleness, and Faith, and
Purity, and Sincerity, and Delight in good Works,
which are excellent signs of the Souls growing strong in
the use of the Spiritual Food. The Holy Spirit of <hi>Christ</hi>
destroys the reigning Power of Sin in her, and the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of the Flesh, for the leaner this grows, and
the more the authority of it is diminished, the better
the Soul thrives, and the more vigorous and active it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
in all its faculties.</p>
            <p>III. Though to call this Feast, <hi>The Lord</hi>'s <hi>Supper</hi>
when it is in most Churches Celebrated in the Morning,
seems to be improper, yet the reason why it still bears
the name, is, Because the same substantial Actions are
still observed in the Celebration of it, that were used by
<hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Disciples</hi> at his first institution in the night;
and not only the same Actions, but the same end and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
is kept on foot, which we find in its first foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and whenever it is celebrated, it's still in imitation
of that <hi>Supper,</hi> and that <hi>Supper</hi> is still remembred in it. The
reason why <hi>Christ</hi> in instituting of it, made use of the
night, which gave it the name of a <hi>Supper,</hi> was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it was to be succedaneous to the <hi>Passover,</hi> which,
according to custom, was eaten at night, as the Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
which the <hi>Jews</hi> remembred then, was performed
by the Angel at night: and as the <hi>Passover</hi> represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the <hi>Old Covenant</hi> or <hi>Testament,</hi> and this <hi>Feast</hi> the
<hi>New,</hi> so it was fit, that the later should be instituted
immediately after the Celebration of the former, that
both being set together, their different signification
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:103387:9"/>
might more plainly appear, and Men might see, what
Mercies they might expect from the bringing in of a
better Covenant. This being the occasion of <hi>Christ</hi>
Celebrating this Feast at night, and consequently the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
ceasing with the <hi>Typical Passover,</hi> the <hi>Christian
Churches,</hi> in process of time, took the liberty of Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brating
it at all seasons, as they saw it either necessary
or expedient. And though what I have said about the
<hi>Passover,</hi> is the Principal reason, why <hi>Christ</hi> made choice
of the night for this Institution, yet, for ought we know,
it might be with an intent also to hint to us, how by
this Sacrament, the <hi>night of Ignorance</hi> which sat heavy
on the minds of most Men, would be dispell'd; that by
<hi>night</hi> is sometimes understood the <hi>night of Ignorance</hi> in
Scripture, is evident from <hi>Matth. 4. 16. Es. 9. 1, 2. Rom.
13. 12.</hi> and that by the devout and religious use of this
Sacrament, <hi>our Ignorance</hi> is in a great measure cured, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
is a sufficient testimony: Hereby certainly our
minds are signally enlightned, and we behold the Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
Love and Goodness of God, discover the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
and ways of Salvation, get clear Apprehensions
of the Mysteries of our Faith, and see how inconsistent
the Works of Darkness are with this solemn remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of the Death of <hi>Christ;</hi> hereby we come to feel
the Power of God toward them that Believe, and find
out the Secret of the Union, that is betwixt <hi>Christ</hi> and
his true Followers, and learn to know, that what is said
in the Word of God, concerning the tender regard of
<hi>Christ</hi> to his Church and Friends, is no Fable. Add to
all this, that <hi>Christ</hi> made choice of the <hi>night,</hi> possibly
to put us in mind of his sudden coming to Judgment,
which is frequently expressed in Scripture by his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the night, <hi>Mark 13. 35, 36. Luke 12. 38, 39. 1
Thessal. 5, 2. Rev. 3. 3.</hi> nor is this an unsuitable Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in this Sacrament to contemplate his coming to judge
the World; for though that coming may strike terror
into Men, that put the evil day far from them, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
not for their Lord's coming, yet to a Soul enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and Sanctified, it cannot but afford matter of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:103387:9"/>
to think at such times, that the same <hi>Jesus,</hi> who
was crucified, will ere long appear in Glory with all his
mighty Angels to give those, that have followed him in
the Regeneration, full possession of the purchas'd Glory
However, at the best, the Celebration of this Feast at
night was but a circumstantial thing, and therefore the
Church is not obliged to keep to it, circumstantial things
depending much upon conveniency, or inconveniency,
which vary in several Ages; and this was the reason,
that though standing at the eating of the Passover was
a commanded circumstance, <hi>Exod. 12. 11.</hi> yet the <hi>Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish</hi>
Church, in after Ages, varied from it, even by
<hi>Christs</hi> own Approbation, and turned that posture into
leaning, as I shall have occasion to shew more largely
in the Chapter about <hi>Kneeling at the Communion.</hi> The
Church therefore sins not in Celebrating this Feast at any
other time, especially in a circumstance barely related,
not commanded. Yet as I said before, because this Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Feast, kept up in all Churches, is still in imitation
of <hi>Christs Supper,</hi> and that <hi>Supper</hi> is religiously remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
in it, and the same essential things, together with
the scope, drift and design of all, are still preserved, it
is not unfitly called the <hi>Lords Supper</hi> still; so that if any
man seems to be contentious about the name, <hi>We have
no such Custom neither the Churches of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 12.
16.</p>
            <p>IV. Yet this is no Argument, but that it may also
lawfully be called and expressed by other Names, and this
we find the Christian Churches have done from time to
time. <hi>Tertullian</hi> was the first that called it a <hi>Sacrament,</hi>
taking the Name from the <hi>Oaths</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Soldiers
took, that they would be true and faithful to their <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror,</hi>
and the rather, because we vow Allegiance and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity
in this Ordinance to the great Master that died
for us. Others have call'd it an <hi>Oblation,</hi> because we of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
up our humble Prayers and Supplications to the God
and Father of Our Lord <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> and our Souls and
Bodies too, when we remember this Beneficial Death.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:103387:10"/>
Sometimes it hath been call'd a <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> because it is not
only a commemoration of the wonderful <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of
<hi>Christs</hi> Death, but we chearfully offer up the Sacrifice of
our Praises for this inestimable Mercy. The name of
<hi>Communion</hi> occurs frequently in the Writings of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients,
because all sincere Christians are hereby tyed in
a bond of mutual Love, participate of the same Bread,
are Fellow-members of the Mystical Body of <hi>Christ,</hi> and
have Communion with <hi>Christ</hi> their Head, and enjoy all
the same Benefits of his Death and sufferings. The
word <hi>Eucharist</hi> is used as often as any other, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
Thanksgiving and Magnifying the Goodness, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and Charity of God the Father, Son and Holy Ghost,
are a great part of the Service here. The name <hi>Mass</hi>
which they of the <hi>Roman</hi> Persuasion, and even the <hi>Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran</hi>
Churches make use of, as it was not known in the
Church for the first Four hundred years after <hi>Christ,</hi> so
the Original of it was this, When the <hi>Lords Supper</hi> was
to be celebrated after Sermon, the Deacon or some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Officer of the Church, called to the People, that
did not, or were not to receive, in these words, <hi>Ite, mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa
est, Depart, the Congregation is dismissed.</hi> In time, that
which was only a Preliminary circumstance of the <hi>Lords
Supper,</hi> was applied to the whole Office, and the Service
was called <hi>Missa,</hi> or <hi>Mass,</hi> a word which the <hi>Romanists</hi>
make a great stir with, and turn into a perfect Charm,
and a monstrous Sacrifice, to the great disparagement
of <hi>Christs</hi> Sufferings, and the Benefits that accrue there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to true Believers. Some of their Writers make it a
<hi>Hebrew</hi> word and fetch it from the Old Testament, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
derive it from the <hi>Greek,</hi> others from the <hi>Northern
Language;</hi> and though it expresses less then any of
those Names we mentioned before, yet hath this swallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up all the rest, and the more superstitious in the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Church</hi> are almost afraid to call it by any other
Name; and the <hi>Mass</hi> is that which both young and Old,
both learned and unlearned among them, have most fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
in their Mouths, though few of the Vulgar know
what it means. I omit here many other Names, appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:103387:10"/>
by Writers to this Mystery; such as <hi>Collect, Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy,
Liturgy, Dominical, Agenda, Anaphora, Synaxis, &amp;c.</hi>
partly because I intend no Critical History, and partly
because by the names I have already spoken of, this
Sacrament is usually known in the <hi>Western Churches.</hi>
That we do so often call it a <hi>Mystery,</hi> is, because the
things discovered and imitated here, do altogether
depend upon Divine Revelation, and are such as Flesh
and Blood understand not, and the Secrets of which,
none but a Person enlightned by the Spirit of God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends
to any purpose, and which transcend all the
<hi>Arcana</hi> or hidden points of Heathen Divinity.</p>
            <p>V. The name of the <hi>Lords Supper</hi> puts us in mind,
that this Holy Feast differs from Common Suppers.</p>
            <p>1. In that Common Suppers are for the support of
<hi>Nature,</hi> this for the support of <hi>Grace</hi> and Goodness in
our Souls. The former are intended for the strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the <hi>Body,</hi> this for the corroboration of our <hi>Faith,</hi>
and <hi>Hope,</hi> and <hi>Love.</hi> Our Common Supper represents to
us the <hi>Ordinary Providence</hi> of God, which opens its hand,
and fills the desire of every living thing: This, Gods
<hi>extraordinary dispensation,</hi> which shews at what cost and
charges we are made the Children of God, and fitted
for everlasting habitations. The former gives us an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the Blessings of Gods <hi>Left,</hi> this of the favours
of his <hi>Right Hand:</hi> The former bids us look into the
<hi>nether,</hi> this into the <hi>upper Springs</hi> of the Divine Clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</p>
            <p>2. In our Common Suppers, our Spirits may unbend,
and our Minds and Tongues take liberty of thinking
and speaking of things relating to our necessary Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments
in the World; in this, our thoughts must
rise, mount up with Wings as Eagles, pierce the Clouds,
and fix on the Riches of Divine Love, retire from the
World, view God, and his glorious Attributes, and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
with that excellent object, improve themselves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:103387:11"/>
Contempla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ion, and adore the Mystery of Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
In the former, no other Preparation is required,
but what we are to bring with us to common affairs and
businesses, <hi>i. e.</hi> Gravity and Sobriety; but in this, the
Heart must be prepared, the Soul chafed, the Affections
warmed, prayers offered, Ejaculations press into Gods
presence, and Self-examination dispose the Soul for
the visits of the Holy Ghost, that it may be a worthy
Guest at so great a Table, and the rather, because God
is in a special manner present here; for wherever Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
displays its brighter beams of Love, there God
is eminently present; that makes Heaven what it is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
there the Divine Goodness shines most gloriously.
In this Sacrament are set before us more then ordinary
Characters of Gods Love; the Angels of Heaven, saith
St. <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> stand round about the Altar, and while
the Minister of the Ordinance is praising him, that
lives for ever and ever, fall down at the same time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing
at the blessings and the <hi>Manna,</hi> which falls down
from Heaven on the Children of Men; so that here we
may cry out, as the Patriarch did of <hi>Bethel, How dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
is this place!</hi>
            </p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The Preceding Considerations reduced to Practice.</head>
               <p>I. THIS Sacarament being a Feast, prepared by the
Greatest Prince for his Servants, those Servants
must needs be inexcusable, that refuse to give their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance
here. I do not deny, but their may be just
excuses and lawful causes of our absence, such as Sickness,
Weakness, Faintness and Distempers, Pains, Aches and
some sudden Accidents and Disasters, which will not
suffer us to fix our thoughts on so reverend an ordinance;
but these hapning against our Wills, and importing no
wilful neglect, God bears with us, under such circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
but to act, as if we did not hear our Master call,
and to suffer the World to put a stop to our coming;
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:103387:11"/>
to be so enamoured with our Profits and sensual Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions,
as not to think our selves concerned in the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to refuse approaching, because we are loath to be at
the pains of searching our Hears and trying our ways;
to neglect coming, because we are loath to sequester our
Thoughts from sublunary Objects and to part with our
Sins; to absent our selves, because we relish the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of this life, before this Celestial Food; this is
to slight what God esteems, and to spurn at the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Mercy; this is to thrust away Salvation, as if it were
worth nothing, and to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ndervalue the pains God takes
to bring us to himself; and what God must think of
such Scorners, I need not tell you, for your selves may
guess, except you believe God to be a Stone or Stock,
how he must resent it; and one would think, it should
cause some sad thoughts within you, if you believe what
he saith, 1 Sam. 2. 30 <hi>They that love me, I will Honour,
but they that despise me, shall be lightly esteemed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>II. When the Church invites us to this Feast, we must
suppose that our Lord himself makes an Address to us,
as it is in Matth. 22. 4. <hi>Behold I have prepared my dinner,
my oxen and my fatlings are killed, and all things are ready,
come ye to the Marriage.</hi> This Holy Ordinance is the
Marriage Feast, which declares our being joyned to the
Son of God, the King immortal, invisible, blessed for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vermore,
<hi>Hearken therefore, O daughter, and consider, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
also thine own People, and thy fathers house, so shall the
King greatly desire thy beauty, for he is thy Lord, and worship
thou him.</hi> This Feast requires suitable Garments, not
<hi>Tyrian Purple,</hi> not <hi>Persian Silks,</hi> not that <hi>outward adorning
with broider'd hair, or gold, or pearl, or costly array, but the
ornament of a meek and quiet Spirit, which in the sight of
God is of great price.</hi> A Garment of Sackcloath is a more
glorious sight in the eyes of him, who is the Master of
This Feast, then all the bravery of the tinckling Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the Daughters of <hi>Sion,</hi> and a Contrite Heart
invites his gracious aspect; and this the Primitive belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
were so sensible of, that before their coming to this
Feast, they humbled their Souls with Fasting, and as
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:103387:12"/>
course and uncomely as this Garb appears to sensual
Men, yet <hi>He that is the lofty and Holy one, who inhabits E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity,</hi>
hath declared his liking and approbation of it,
<hi>For to that man will I look, that is of an humble a and contrite
Spirit, and trembles at my word,</hi> Es. 66. 2. Es. 57. 15. We
read of a Garment of Praise too Es. 61. 3. a Garment,
which the Angels of Light are adorned and deckt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
a Garb so pleasing, that the Eternal Father smiles on
them, and it smells sweeter than that of <hi>Esau;</hi> God like
old <hi>Isaac,</hi> takes notice of it, and blesses them. St. <hi>Paul</hi>
understood this, and wore it constantly. Hence it is,
that we find him so liberal in praising the <hi>Cross of Christ;</hi>
with this he seems always transported, and he seldom
talks of Christ without Raptures, an object upon which
he though he could never say enough. Being rapt up
into the Third Heaven, he had heard the melodious
voices of the <hi>four and twenty Elders, and the new Song,
they sung to the Lamb that was slain; Thou art worthy to
take the book, and to open the Seals thereof, for thou wast
slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every
kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation,</hi> Rev. 5. 9. and
he could not have a better Pattern. And now that we
speak of Garments, that make us welcome Guests at
this Table, we must not forget the Garment or Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of good Works, which St. <hi>Paul</hi> takes notice of, <hi>1
Tim. 2. 10.</hi> These are the <hi>Shining Robes</hi> our Souls must
be ambitious of; these adorn our Profession, charm spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctators,
attract followers, and are apt to make People
in love with goodness: and what is more, change us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the same Image with the Author and Finisher of our
Faith, whose province and imployment was, <hi>going about</hi>
and <hi>doing good,</hi> as we are told <hi>Act 10. 38.</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
this cannot but be a proper Ornament, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
in, at this Banquet: And of this nature is the <hi>white
Garment,</hi> we read of <hi>Eccles. 9. 8.</hi> or the Garment of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence

                  <hi>O</hi> Holy and merciful Saviour, merciful beyond example,
who treatest me as thy Child, hast prepared a Table for
me, and made my Cup run over! Be thou my Shepherd, let
me want no Grace, no Mercy, no Assistance that's necessary
for me in the prosecuting of mine Eternal Happiness. Dress
me with thy Robes, adorn me with the Ensigns of thy Favour.
Let me rejoyce at the Supper, thou hast prepared for me. Teach
me to entertain thy Call with gladness. Let me see clearly,
what thou hast prepared for them that love thee. Thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
my stubborn and lazy Heart, rouze it from its slumber;
melt it by the fire of thy love; breath upon these dry Bones,
and they shall live: Let me not with <hi>Esau</hi> prefer a morsel of
Bread, eaten in secret, before my Birth-right to Eternal Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
Let me consider thy Condescension in inviting such a
Wretch to sup with thee. Let not the evil examples, I see be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
me, be any temptation to me. Uphold me by thy right
hand. Let me dread thine anger, and count it a greater dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
to be despised by thee, than to be made the filth and off-scouring
of all things. Give me a just esteem of thy favour,
let me prefer it before all the Contents of this present World.
Let me feel that thy loving kindness is better than life; this
life will sade away, but thy Mercy endureth for ever. Let
Goodness and Mercy follow me all the days of my life, and
make me dwell in thy House for ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <p>The Treachery of Judas: His Character, and how That is
imitated by Nominal Christians at this day. Christ be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray'd
to wicked Men and to Devils; betray'd partly for
filthy Lucre, partly for his unchangeable integrity. The same
is still done by Hypocrites in Religion. This Sacrament
instituted that very Night, when he was betrayed, for
three Reasons, The different appearances of Sin, when Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed
slightly, and when considered in its designs and Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencies.
While we detest the Treason of Judas, we are
to take heed, we do not become guilty of the same Crime.
The Prayer.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>1. THough in the first Chapter I have already hinted
the reason, why Christ made use of the Night,
to institute this Holy Sacrament, yet the Evangelists
laying an Emphasis or weight upon his instituting of it,
<hi>that night,</hi> in which he was betray'd, it's fit we should
search into the Mystery of it: But before we can do this
some Circumstances of that Treason must be considered,
which will give light to Christ's design in pitching up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that time, and no other. The Person that did ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
on this height of Impiety, was <hi>Judas Iscariot,</hi> a
a Man, who by this Treason, hath indeed left an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:103387:13"/>
Name behind him, but such an one, as all A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
must detest, and talk of with greater Indignation,
than the Heathens did of <hi>Herostratus,</hi> who, to make
himself illustrious by doing mischief, burnt the famous
Temple of <hi>Diana:</hi> By this Man, the Ever-blessed <hi>JESUS</hi>
was betrayed; and if you will allow me to give a true
Character of him, some of us in this Glass may see their
own treachery and deformity.</p>
            <p>1. He was betray'd by one, who made profession of
Religion, but was a Hypocrite; <hi>i.e.</hi> his Actions contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
his Profession, professing one thing, he did ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and seeming to be good, he proved a Devil. Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie
at this day makes Men Traitors to <hi>Christ,</hi> even
their coming to the Temple of the Lord, and adhering
to their known Sins, their frequenting the Ordinances of
God, and being unconcerned at his Promises and Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings;
their believing the Articles of Religion, and act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
contrary to the design of them; their sinding fault
with those sins in others, which they have no aversion
from in themselve; their speaking honourably of God
with their Lips, and dispensing with affronts, put upon him
in their practices; and what can we call this, but <hi>Judas-like</hi>
to betray the Son of Man with a Kiss; to say <hi>Hail-Master,</hi>
and deliver him to be Crucified; to cry <hi>Hosanna,</hi>
and by and by, <hi>Away with him;</hi> at once to embrace,
and to decide him; to hug, and to contemn him; to how
the knee to him, and mock him; and in imitation to the
rude Soldiery, to cloath him with Purple, and to strike
and buffet him.</p>
            <p>2. He was betray'd by one, who, by no argument of
love or mercy, could be wrought into a sincere reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
He had seen the Miracles of his Master; himself,
by his Masters influence, did wonders, and he saw Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
shine in him, nor was Christ wanting in warning,
Teaching, Instructing, Entreating and admonishing of
him, yet nothing could prevail with him to purge out
the Leven of Malice and wickedness; and is not Christ
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:103387:14"/>
betray'd this way by thousands at this day? <hi>He that des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pises
you,</hi> saith he to his Servants and Instruments, <hi>des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pises
me;</hi> and then if his calling to Men, by his Minist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
by signal providences, by Mercies, by Afflictions by
their Consciences, by their Infirmities and Sicknesses,
Weaknesses and approaching Death, will not make them
sensible of their Duty; if in despite of his endeavours
to keep them from being undone, they scorne both his
Yoak and his Love, what greater treason can they be
guilty of? especially where they make his mercy a shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for their sin; are therefore <hi>evil,</hi> because he is <hi>good,</hi>
and are tempted by his Patience, to be refractory and
obstinate.</p>
            <p>II. He was betray'd both to wicked Men and Devils.</p>
            <p>1. To <hi>Wicked Men,</hi> such as the Scribes and Elders of
the Jews, his sworn Enemies, and this way he is still be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray'd;
for though there be no <hi>Scribes,</hi> no <hi>Pharises</hi> at
this day, yet there are Atheistical and sensual Men, who
seeing Christ's Religion made a Clock for ill Designs
and bad Practices, take occasion from thence to speak
evil of it, as <hi>David</hi> having professed much zeal to God,
and falling afterwards into very monstrous sins, made
the Enemies of the Lord Blaspheme and laugh at the
advantages, the Jews boasted of above the Doctrines and
Principles of their Neighbour-Idolaters. Indeed to see
Men wicked and vain under a shew of Piety, and while
they profess to be followers of <hi>Jesus,</hi> live directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the example and precepts of the Holy <hi>Jesus,</hi>
makes that pretended Devotion ridiculous; and instead
of converting Men of loose Principles, drives them far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
off, and tempts them to think all Religion to be
nothing but a Cheat: And though this Inference is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just
and absurd, yet still these dangerous Inferences will
be laid at their door, who either contradicted the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of their Religion, by their actions, or made it a
Stalking horse to ill Designs and Purposes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:103387:14"/>
2. <hi>He was betray'd to Devils too,</hi> who seeing him in the
hands of bloody and barbarous Men, left and forsaken,
as it were by Heaven and that Divinity, which dwelt
there, took the greater boldness to set upon him by temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations;
and as these foes watch opportunities, and then
molest most, when Men are least able to controul their
insolence; so seeing the Saviour of the World thus seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
forsaken, we may suppose they assaulted him with
greater fierceness, partly because his design had been to
destroy their Kingdom, and partly because he had so
often dispossessed them of their Habitations: It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Opinion of the Learned Men, that in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
of <hi>Gethsemane,</hi> when Christ fell into trembling fits,
the Devil appeared to him in a visible and most dismal
shape, which occasions an Angels descent from above to
comfort him; but whether it were so or no, the Fiend
seeing him betray'd, and deliver'd into the hands of his
own slaves, without all peradventure, triumph'd in his
misery, and insulted over him with greater scorn, and
in imitation of <hi>David</hi>'s Enemies, cry'd <hi>Aha, So would
he have it;</hi> so doth the Hypocrite betray Christ to the
Devil, who hearing the painted Christian talk of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification
and contempt of the World, the two funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
points of his Masters Religion, and seeing him
act point blank against them, doth not only deride and
despise Religion, but casts reproaches on Christ himself,
as if the motives, he was come to give the World, were
impotent and unable to effect that mighty change, the
Gospel speaks of, and which the Son of God used to
Glory in, while the World was so happy as to enjoy
his Presence. The Devils rejoyce to see Christ thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated
in his grand designs of Reformation; and though
he is in Glory at this time, yet the Hypocrites actions
raise a Persecution against him, and put the Devils up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
new insolencies against his Honour and Majesty; what
say they, are these thy Servants and Disciples; are these
the Men that are changed from <hi>Glory</hi> to <hi>Glory?</hi> What
do they more than the disciples of Hell? And if the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
pleasures of the World, I hold out to them, can
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:103387:15"/>
preponderate, and do more with them, than the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of thy death, and the motives drawn from a Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
endless life, where is thy power, or where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
hath thy Kingdom the advantage of my Empire?</p>
            <p>III. He was betray'd partly for filthy Lucre, partly
for his unchangeable Integrity,</p>
            <p>1. For <hi>filthy Lucre.</hi> The love of Money, the root of
all evil, was the cause of it. The Thirty Peices of Silver
invited the Traitor to this Enterprise: So powerful is
Gold and Silver, that at this day it tempts Men to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray
the Son of God, for we see they care not what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
of Religion, so their Purses swell: and are indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent,
whether Gods Honour be maintained or no, so
their Corn, and Wine, and Oyl increaseth: This makes
Men venture on the foulest sins, and draws them into
actions, which should not be so much as named among
Christians: This tempts them to oppress, to cheat, to
flatter, to dissemble, to lie, and to forswear themselves, to
comply with the sinful humours of Men, and to debase
their Souls to the dirtiest and most disingenuous Actions;
yet all this while, such will be counted Christians and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants,
and of the true Religion, against which the
Gates of Hell shall not be able to prevail,</p>
            <p>2. For his unchangeable Integrity. He would not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<hi>Judas</hi> to profess himself his Disciple, and cherish
base and covetous desires; the <hi>Lord Jesus,</hi> that knew his
heart, we may suppose, bid him either leave his profession,
or with his profession, cleanse the inside of the Cup and
Platter; convinced him, that the love of God and that
of the World were incompatible, and did mutually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
each other: This the illnatured Disciple could not
brook, and because his Master would not give him leave
to enjoy Gods favour, and his own sins together, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray'd
him. This is the case of Counterfeit Christians
at this day; because <hi>Christ</hi> will not permit them to
blend his Religion with their delight in vanity, will not
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:103387:15"/>
allow them to serve <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Mammon;</hi> they expose his
Religion to that contempt and scorn, we have mention'd,
as if they would be revenged upon God for being so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
to them, as not to permit an alliance to be made
betwixt the Temple of God and Idols, betwixt Christ
and <hi>Belial,</hi> betwixt Light and Darkness.</p>
            <p>IV. Why Christ would Institute this Sacrament that
very Night, in which he was betray'd, will appear from
these following Reasons.</p>
            <p>1. To shew, <hi>that he delighted not in the death of the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi>
therefore the same Night that he was betray'd, he
provided a remedy that Sinners might not die, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the Offenders might be restored to life and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
if they did not wilfully reject it. That Pardon
and Deliverance, and freedom from everlasting Death,
is offer'd, tender'd, convey'd and sealed in this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to every Sinner, that is unfeignedly resolv'd to be
Friends with God upon his own terms, is confess'd by all
the Christian World. It was therefore Instituted that
Night that <hi>Judas</hi> did betray him, to shew, that if even
<hi>Judas,</hi> and all such Traytors, that should some way or
other imitate him in his Actions, either had come, or
should for the future come and throw away their Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons,
their Enmity and their Arms, quit their Hostility,
and humble themselves before their offended Father, that
they shall not miss of Mercy and Forgiveness, than which,
there cannot be a greater sign, that he delights not in
their Ruin: That Night, when he was persecuted, to
provide a Refuge for his Persecutors: That Night,
when his Enemies were like to practise Treason, to think
on a way how that Treason might be pardoned: That
Night, when they were going to undo themselves, to
provide a Pool, in which they might wash and be clean:
This surely spoke his desire, that they might not die.
Wonderful Goodness! He foresaw the Wounds they
would give to their Souls, and before they give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
those wounds, he prepares a Plaister to heal them:
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:103387:16"/>
He saw how fierce and violent the Poison was they were
going to take, and at the same time provides an Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote:
He saw they were going to starve their Souls, and
at the same time orders Meat and Drink to be made rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to preserve them from expiring.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>He Instituted it</hi> that very Night <hi>to admonish us,
that when we come to receive these Holy Elements, we
should remember with grief and sorrow, how often we
have betray'd his Glory to his Enemies, and by the hein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
of the sin, be frighted from attempting the like
again; and what can be more reasonable at such times,
than to reflect:</hi> Ah Wretch that I am! How like a Bruit
have I lived under the Name of a Christian! I have called my
Master, Lord, and have done mine own Will! I have called
him Father, and when he hath bid me work in his Vineyard,
have run away! I have profess'd love to the Lord Jesus, and
been asham'd of him and of his Gospel! I have seem'd a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout
Worshipper of him, and been a stranger to self-denial!
And when my Profit, Ease or Credit, have been in danger,
how have I left him with the Disciples and fled! How have
I betray'd him by such cowardice! What occasion of reproach
have I given to his Enemies! How have I harden'd others in
their sins by such doings! How have I made sensual Men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise
that noble Religion, the Son of God sealed with his dearest
Blood! And shall I betray him any longer? Shall I still deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
him up to be mock'd! Shall I dare to do such a barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
thing again? No, No, I'll confess Thee before Men, my
Dearest Lord, that thou mayst confess and own me in the last
day before thy Father, and his Holy Angels.</p>
            <p>3. He Instituted this Sacrament that Night, to teach
us, that we must do good for evil; <hi>Judas</hi> betrays him,
and that very Night he is contriving, how <hi>Judas,</hi> if he
would have accepted of the offer, might be saved from
Everlasting ruin: this was his method and course of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
in the World, to reward unkindnesses with ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness
and compassion to the Offenders. The <hi>Jews</hi>
cry <hi>Crucifie him,</hi> and he prays for them, <hi>Father, forgive
them, for they know not what they do; Malchus,</hi> who
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:103387:16"/>
came out against him to apprehend him, and as 'tis
probable, was ruder than the rest, having his Ear cut
off, by his miraculous touch, is restored to his former
soundness; <hi>Herod</hi> seeks to kill him, and at the same
time he purges his Country from Devils and Diseases:
This sure could not be done, but with an intent to shew us
an example, and except we do as he did, how can we
be said to be his followees! It's from this great Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
that the Apostle infers a Duty, <hi>Rom. 12. 21. Be not
overcome with evil, but overcome the evil with good;</hi> and
we all know, who it was that told us, that in vain we
call our selves <hi>Children of God,</hi> except we <hi>do good to them
that hate us,</hi> Matth. 5. 44, 45.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The Preceding Considerations reduced to Practice.</head>
               <p>I. VVe see here, in what a different shape Sin ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
from what it did before, if the nature,
tendency, and design of it be rightly considered. That
which before seem'd but a little Cloud or Twilight, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
such a prospect, will appear Egyptian Darkness.
Who of us makes any thing of Hypocrisie? yet have
we proved before, that it is a betraying of the Son of
God, especially, if it be reigning and allow'd of. So
it is with other sins. The Jews, <hi>Malach. 3. 8.</hi> thought
their keeping back their Tythes, and depriving the
Priests and Ministers of the Lord of their due, to be a
trivial thing, yet God speaks to them in Thunder, and
calls it <hi>robbing</hi> of the Almighty: <hi>Will a Man rob God?
Yet ye have robb'd me. Wherein have we robb'd thee? In
Tythes and Offerings.</hi> So they made nothing of offering
the Lame and the Blind, but God calls it profanation of
his Name, <hi>Mal. 1. 12.</hi> A wise Man therefore, and he
that would not cheat himself in matters of Salvation,
must consider what verdict God gives of such sins, as
the World makes little of, and in so doing, will find
how unsafe it is, to venture on such trespasses, and
what dangerous things they are. Indeed, he that exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:103387:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and ponders, what names God gives to some sins
in Scripture, how he calls Covetousness <hi>Idolatry,</hi> Ephes.
5. 5. Disobedience <hi>Witchcraft,</hi> 1 Sam. 15. 23. Unbelief
under the means of Grace, <hi>trampling on, and treading
under foot the Son of God,</hi> Heb. 10. 29. Living in a known
sin, <hi>being of the Devil,</hi> 1 John, 3. 8. Sensuality, <hi>Enmity
to the Cross of Christ,</hi> Phil. 3. 18. Apostacy, <hi>Crucifying of
Christ afresh,</hi> Heb. 6. 6. Love of the World, <hi>Adultery,</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>Jam. 4. 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> must needs have other apprehensions of
such sins, than the duller, or more vitious sort of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
hath; and until we do so, it's a sign we have no
mind to be sincere Converts, till we look upon our Sins
through the Glass of Scripture; till we give our Sins
those Names, which He, that cannot err, doth give
them; till we begin to call them, what they are indeed,
and our hearts are concern'd and troubled about that,
which such names import; our Repentance is but lame
and partial, and we obstruct our way to mercy and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness,
and prepare for being miserable in the midst
of flattering hopes and expectations.</p>
               <p>II, As we do abhor and detest the Treason of <hi>Judas,</hi>
so let's take heed, we become not guilty of it our selves.
We are not in a capacity of acting that very Treason,
that the ill-natured Disciple did, because Christ is not
now on Earth, and the circumstances of Time, and Place,
and Government, do differ; yet how that Treason may
be acted over again by a behaviour and conversation
agreeable to that of <hi>Judas,</hi> hath been already shew'd;
and whatever we do, let's not fall into the snare, into
which that unhappy Man did fall: His end, his despair;
the terrors of his mind, the torments of his conscience;
the contempt and scorn of God and Men, he rusht into,
are sufficient discouragements from that Hypocrisie, which
drove him on to those Precipices. To maintain invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Loyalty to our Great Master, is not only our Duty,
but our Interest. To promote whatever makes for his
Honour and Glory, is that which becomes us, not only
as we are his Subjects, but as we are redeemed with his
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:103387:17"/>
Blood: So great a Mercy ought to crush every rebellious
thought in our Minds. Never had people a more gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
King; a King, which doth not only divide his
Estate among his Subjects, but is resolved to advance
them to the highest Dignities they are capable of. And
what, if sometimes he doth afflict us? That doth not
speak him a Tyrant, but a Father, or Physician rather,
who lets us Blood to prevent Diseases, and launces our
Wounds, that they may not fester and kill us. If he lays
Burthens upon us, it is not to oppress our <hi>Souls,</hi> but our
<hi>Sins;</hi> and if he make us go through the Fire, it is not
that the Flame may consume us, but that the Smoke may
kill the Caterpillars and Locusts, that eat the wholsom
Herbs of our Graces. It is not that he delights in our
Groans, but that he is desirous of our Welfare; and
when he scourges us, it is necessity, and our own good,
that puts him upon using that method, not a fondness to
exercise his Power and Authority.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>O</hi> Blessed JESUS! When I look upon thee, and behold
thy Beauty and Glory, I wonder how I have been able to
conspire against thee with thine Enemies! How have I been led
away by false appearances, and listned to false rumours, which
sinful Men have spread abroad concerning thee! Thou hast been
represented to me as an Enemy to my mirth, and ease, and
plenty, and temporal advantages, and I have believed it, and
run blindly with the multitude to crucifie thee! I see, how a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

I have acted! O forget the Injuries I have offered thee!
O remember no more the Treasons I have been guilty of! Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,

Let all Guile, and Hypocrisie, and Double-dealings, be put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way

Let all enmity, all dissention, all hostility betwixt us

cease. I agree, not only to a Truce, but to an Eternal Peace.
I know, Lord, the danger of breaking the Peace lies on my side,
who am naturally treacherous, fickle and inconstant, but thy
Grace can cure that inconstancy. Lord, stretch forth thy mighty
Arm, and hold me up, that I may never depart from thee,
may always love to be with thee, always delight in thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
always rejoice in thy love, and always seek thy honour

            <argument>
               <head>The CONTENTS.</head>
               <p>The Publick Church, the fittest Place to receive the Lord's
Supper in. This, proved from the Practice of the Apostles,
and the succeeding Christians. The same proved from Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and the end, for which Christ died. Private Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munions
first began in times of Persecution. The Danger
and Imprudence of those, who, neglecting to receive it in
Publick, do not think of it till they come to lye upon their
Death-beds. What a mercy it is, that we have Publick
Churches, where we may serve and worship God, without
fear or molestation. Great Gravity and Devotion required
in the Publick Worship of God. The Prayer.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>I. THat the publick Church is the most proper, most
warranted, and fittest place to celebrate and eat
the Lord's Supper in; seems to have been the constant
belief of the Christian Church, and they have grounded
their Belief on the Apostles Expostulation with the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians,
1 Cor. 11. 20, 22.</hi> where speaking of their
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:103387:18"/>
coming together into one place, and distinguishing pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Houses from the Church of God, he intimates a
known custom in that Age, to meet in certain Oratories,
or places appointed for publick Worship, and there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Holy Symbols. That which is commonly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected,
of the great Improbability of publick Buildings
and Edifices, in times of Persecution, such as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
and the Christians, for the first three Centuries,
had sad experience of, seems to carry greater weight
than really it doth; for though we speak of places ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
for Publick Worship, no Person of common
Sense can imagine, that we mean, they had such stately
and magnificent Buildings, as our Churches are at this
day, the Effects of Ease, and Peace, and Plenty: These
came not in, till <hi>Constantine</hi> procured the Churches Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spit,
and Freedom from their former Bondage; yet we
may justly enough suppose, that even in those days of
trouble, and calamitous times, they either converted some
spacious upper Room, in a charitable Believer's House,
into a Church, or some good Christian gave, and dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
his House for that Religious Use; or the Believers,
by common consent, turned it into a Place of publick
Worship, which is the reason that the Disciples are said
to have met in an <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or upper Room, <hi>Act. 1. 13.</hi>
possibly the same which <hi>Christ</hi> celebrated the <hi>Eucharist</hi>
in; and who knows not, that mention is sometimes
made of a Church in such a Man's House? as <hi>Colos. 4.
15. Salute Nymphas, and the Church at his House.</hi> Upon
which words, <hi>Oecumenus</hi> tells us, He was
a was a great Man,<note place="margin">Oecum in loc. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> for he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
his House into a Church. And
though it is said, <hi>Act. 2. 46. That the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
continuing daily with one accord in
the Temple, and breaking of Bread from
House to House, did eat their Meat with
gladness of heart;</hi> yet the Phrase <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which we ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
from <hi>House to House,</hi> as our Translators take notice
in the Margent, may as well be rendered <hi>in the House;</hi>
and then the meaning will be this, That continuing daily
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:103387:19"/>
in the Temple, or frequenting the Temple daily, they
broke Bread in the House, <hi>i. e.</hi> in the House by the
Temple, appropriated to the publick Christian Worship,
and particularly in that upper Room by the Temple,
where the Apostles and Believers used to meet; in which
place, when they had broken Bread, or received the
<hi>Eucharist,</hi> they went home to their own Houses, and
sat down to their private Meals with joy and great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</p>
            <p>II. The succeeding Churches observ'd this very Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giously,
and therefore call'd the Holy Communion <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
or a <hi>Convocation,</hi> because they judged it meet, the
whole Church should be together when it was admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred:
For this reason it was also call'd <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Liturgy,</hi>
which properly imports <hi>Publick Administration of an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,</hi>
and therefore applied, <hi>Rom. 15. 27.</hi> to publick di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stribution
of Alms, to the Magistrate's executing of his
Office, <hi>Rom. 13. 4,</hi> and to the Office of Teaching and
Prophecying in the publick Congregation, <hi>Acts 13. 2.</hi>
And this gave occasion to <hi>Cyril</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> to say in an
Epistle to <hi>Coelosyrius,</hi> That <hi>the Eucharist, or Sacred Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bols,
ought to be offered no where, but in the Churches of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers;
and that he, who attempts the contrary, doth mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly
violate the Law of God,</hi> meaning the Apostles practice
before-mentioned, <hi>which, he supposes,</hi> amounts to a <hi>vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Command.</hi> To this purpose the Council of <hi>Laodicea</hi>
forbad all Bishops and Priests to celebrate the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
in private Houses;<note place="margin">Soc. l. 2. c. 33.</note> and <hi>Eustathius</hi> the Bishop
of <hi>Sebastia,</hi> as <hi>Socrates</hi> tells us, among other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
was deposed from his Place and Dignity,
for this, because he had given permission to have the
Lord's Supper administred in private Houses, which was,
saith the <hi>Historian,</hi> against the Ecclesiastical Rules: Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding this, it was customary at <hi>Rome</hi> to do so,
which makes St. <hi>Hierome,</hi> in his Book against <hi>Jovinian,</hi>
find fault with the abuse, and expostulate with them, <hi>Why
do they not go to Church to receive Christ's Body and Blood?
Are there two Christs? one in publick, another in private?</hi>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:103387:19"/>
And indeed, those Christians that insisted upon this pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Administration, had the Jewish Church for their
pattern; for it being taken for granted, that the Lord's
Supper was succedaneous to the Passover, as the <hi>Paschal
Lamb</hi> was to be kill'd in the Temple, and in publick, so
it was fit, that the solemn Remembrance of the Death
of that Lamb, which was to take away the sins of the
World, the <hi>Antitype</hi> of the other, should be celebrated
in publick, and in the Congregations of Christians. That
the Paschal Lamb, which every Family among the Jews
were obliged to eat of, was killed in the Temple, is more
than probable; for though <hi>Philo</hi> the Jew seems to take it
for granted, that every Master of a Family had Liberty
to kill the Paschal Lamb at his own House; yet, as judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Men have observed, <hi>Philo</hi> being an <hi>Alexandrian,</hi> and
not having those opportunities of searching into the Jewish
Rites that others had, who lived at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> might ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
run into a mistake; the rather, because <hi>Josephus</hi> and
most Jews affirm the contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> That every Master
of a Family was obliged to bring the Lamb intended to
be eaten at the Celebration of the Passover, to the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
to the Priests, who were to kill it for him. If it
had not been so, it is not easie to imagine how the Priests
could have given so exact an account to <hi>Cestius</hi> of the
number of the Jews that were come up to the Passover at
that time, for they gave in an account of 55000 and 600
Persons that had presented themselves at the Feast, which
in all likelihood they knew by the Lambs, the People
brought to them to be slain for their respective Families;
and though Jewish Customs lay no Obligations upon
Christians, yet where the Gospel gives a Rule, a Jewish
practice, in a case not much unlike, may serve for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
of the Observance.</p>
            <p>III. The publick eating of the Lord's Supper, doth
certainly best represent the end for which Christ died;
and that is the Publick Good; a Good, which <hi>Caiaphas</hi>
ignorantly acknowledged and confessed, when he told
the Jews, <hi>Ye know nothing at all, nor consider, that it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:103387:20"/>
for us, that one man should die for the people, and that the
whole multitude perish not,</hi> Jon. 11. 49. 50. But St. <hi>John</hi>
is fuller in the explication of this Good, when he asserts,
that his death is a <hi>propitiation for our sins, and not for ours
only, but for the sins of the whole World,</hi> 1 Jon. 2. 2. Many
things are by Men pretended to be done for the Publick
Good; but what they call Publick, is either for the Good
of a Family, or Corporation, or Parish, or City, or a
certain Territory, or a Kingdom: But the Death of
Christ spreads its Virtues infinitely wider, not confining
its Benefits to a Province, or a part of the World, but
the whole Race of Mankind was concern'd in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
so that nothing was ever done so truly for the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Good, as Christ's Suffering and Dying; and whoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
remembers it in publick, testifies his esteem and value
of it, not only by his inward sense and admiration of it,
but by the very place, in which he doth remember it.
The Truth is, <hi>Christ</hi> was crucified publickly in the face
of the Sun, and before huge multitudes, both of Jews
and Proselytes, who were come to give their attendance
at the Passover: Both Jews and Gentiles beheld the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle,
and Men of all sorts and conditions crouded to
see so dreadful a shew, which was an <hi>Item,</hi> that the
remembrance of it should be in the most publick place,
<hi>the Church;</hi> the rather, because this publick remembrance
doth best promote Christ's Glory, as multitudes joyning
together in Confessions, and Praises, must necessarily
advance it more than the <hi>Hallelujahs</hi> of two or three in
private.</p>
            <p>IV. Private Communions, or Communions in places,
which were neither Churches nor publick Oratories,
owe their first rise to the Churches persecutions: For
when <hi>Nero</hi> and his successors in the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to defile the Faith with Blood; and to be a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
and a Malefactor, were made convertible Terms,
the Christians were forced to serve God, as they could,
and therefore celebrated the Communion in any place,
to which they were driven in the common Storm, in
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:103387:20"/>
Mines, in Ships, in Stables, in Prisons, in Caves, and
Dens of the Earth, and where two or three Christians
had the convenience of getting a Bishop or Minister, to
consecrate the Elements, they chearfully remember'd
their Crucify'd Lord and Master, as <hi>Dionisius</hi> of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria</hi>
tells us in <hi>Eusebius.</hi> And this soon
occasion'd another Custom,<note place="margin">Euseb. Hist.</note> which was, to
send part of the Consecrated Bread and
Wine to Peoples Houses,<note place="margin">Eccl. l. 7. c. 21.</note> and Cottages in
the Country; <hi>Justin Martyr</hi> is very express in this
point. And hence it came to pass, that the Christians
kept the Consecrated Elements by them, to make use
of them, when either sickness seiz'd them, or they found
death approaching; and upon this account the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was called the <hi>Viaticum,</hi> or provision for a Man's
Journy into another World, as we learn from
<hi>Gregory</hi> the <hi>Great.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gregor. l. 7.</note> And because the Holy
Bread thus kept for use,<note place="margin">Epistol. 62.</note> was sometimes too
big for the sick, or dying Person to swallow, they crum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
the Bread into the Consecrated Wine, and gave it
the sick Person in a Spoon, as we see in the
example of <hi>Serapian</hi> in <hi>Eusebius;</hi>
               <note place="margin">L. 6. c. 23.</note> a thing, which
in process of time was thought so necessary for all dying
Christians, that in some places where Superstition thrust
out true Devotion, in case a Person dyed before he
had received the Communion, they would thrust, and
force the crums of Bread, mingled with Holy Wine,
into the Mouths of Persons already departed, against
which profanation the Fathers thought themselves obliged
to Enact very severe Canons; which was done according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the Councils of <hi>Carthage, Antisiodorum,</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople;</hi>
and <hi>Julius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> forbad putting
the Crums of Consecrated Bread in Wine, a practice,
which in all probability came first from sending the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated
Elements to Persons absent from the Publick,
who either could not, or durst not, appear in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Oratories; a thing that <hi>Origen</hi> either foresaw, or
knew would be abused, which makes him inveigh against
such presumption: So that as Persecution first brought in
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:103387:21"/>
private Communions, so when those Persecutions cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
the Church still obliged her Members to receive
the Communion in publick, according to the first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution.
It is therefore wisely ordered by our Church,
that People shall be exhorted in time of their health, to
receive the <hi>Eucharist</hi> in publick, that they may not be
disquieted for the omission of it, when Diseases or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempers
do suddainly seize upon them; at which times,
as the Senses and Faculties are weak, so Men cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
these Mysteries with that Vigor, Zeal, and Love,
that is required in the right use of the Ordinance. And
indeed, where People neglect receiving in publick, not
thinking of their Duty till death put them in mind of it,
we can promise them but little comfort<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He that hath
often appeared at the Lord's Table in publick, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
the scene of his life with this remembrance, may
reap more than ordinary satisfaction from it, because
he perfects that in private, which he so often comfortably
made use of in publick; but he whose Eyes were never o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
to see the necessity of it, till his dying groans remove
his blindness, as he hath despised the Church of God,
and neglected the time of his Visitation, so his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
can neither be so great, nor so solid, as his, who
hath frequently strengthen'd his Soul in publick with
this Cordial: when the powers of the Soul are shaken
with a violent sickness, and the Limbs are weak, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
faint, and the Thoughts diverted by uneasiness and
pain, Alas! How can the Soul fix on the Cross of
Christ? What Sense, what touches of his Love can it
have, or what guesses can it make at its Spiritual growth,
and advancement in Holiness? And though, according
to the old Proverb, <hi>It's better late, than never,</hi> yet it's to
be fear'd, such Men come so very late, that if they were
to be pictur'd, they might justly be drawn, as the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
drew <hi>Salomon,</hi> hanging betwixt Heaven and Hell,
it being very doubtful which of these two would fall to
their share. So that upon a review of the whole, tho'
private Communions cannot be said to be altogether
unlawful, especially in times of persecution, nor incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:103387:21"/>
to persons, who have frequently attended this
Ordinance in publick, when they were able so in times
of Peace and Liberty, and Tranquility, for Men and
Women to continue strangers to publick Receiving, and
to satisfie themselves with a private Communion, upon
a Death bed, is a thing so inexcusable, that we cannot,
but with all possible earnestness discourage it, as a thing,
that's dishonour to the Church they live in; a disgrace
to the Religion they profess; an impediment to their
comfort, a <hi>remora</hi> to their joy, an affront to their Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
and an uncertain cherisher of their hopes of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The Preceeding Considerations, reduced to Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice.</head>
               <p>I. WHat a mercy is it, that we have Publick
Churches and Oratories to go to, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
lett or hindrance; that we have no Tyrants, nor Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Enemies, no Rods, no Axes, no noise of War, no
Armies of Aliens, to fright us from the Publick Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
that we can meet, and remember our <hi>Crucified Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi>
without fear, without disturbance, without danger;
and that, instead of being discountenanced in the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
we have all the encouragement that Authority can
give; and our Magistrates are <hi>nursing Fathers,</hi> which not
only allow of our frequenting the House of God, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
compel us to come in. How did the excellent <hi>David</hi>
bemoan himself, when through the Malice of <hi>Saul,</hi> his
Antagonist, he was forced away from the Publick Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the Church! How much happier did he think
<hi>Swallows</hi> and <hi>Sparrows</hi> to be, than himself, which had
liberty to build their Nests, about the roof of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and there to lay their Young, <hi>Psal, 84. 1, 2, 3.</hi>
While he must be content with wishes and breathings
after the Courts of the Lord, and strangers cast it in his
Teeth of often, <hi>Where is now thy God!</hi> Psal. 42. 2, 3. We,
that have all the external advantages of Religion, and are
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:103387:22"/>
even cloy'd with the plenty of Spiritual Provision, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
imagine the lamentable condition, that persecuted
Christians are in, who are forced to serve the Lord
with fear, and to attend his Ordinances with trembling,
who are not permitted to sing the Songs of <hi>Zion</hi> in a
strange Land, and therefore must hang their Harps up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Willows, sit weeping by the Rivers of <hi>Babylon,</hi>
and hear the Enemy roar in the midst of the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
of the Lord. Yet, if the liberty, we enjoy,
makes us wanton, and the plenty God gives us, tempts
us to licentiousness; if instead of growing better, it
makes us worse; and the Glory of our Temple proves
an occasion of dishonouring that God, who dwells in
them; if our going up to Mount <hi>Zion,</hi> makes us proud,
and the means of Grace, whereof we have such store,
are improved into quarrels and dissentions; if instead of
Glorifying God for this affluence, we fall out among our
selves, and instead of letting our Light shine before Men,
espouse the works of Darkness; if instead of being obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
to the Faith, we disgrace it by our infidelity, and
instead of the power of Godliness, content our selves
with the Form of it; if the <hi>Manna</hi> we have, doth not
make us Hunger and Thirst after Righteousness; and
the great Truths God hath vouchsafed us, do not make
our Lives great and exemplary, we have reason to fear
God will remove our Candlesticks from us, and send a
Famine of the Word; God did so to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and
did so to the <hi>Eastern Churches,</hi> and we being like them,
may justly expect the same Judgments.</p>
               <p>II. The Church is the House of God, <hi>keep therefore
thy foot, when thou goest to the House of God,</hi> Eccles. 5. 1.
As Men that walk in danger, look to their steps, and
take care where they set their Foot, so he that enters
into the House of Prayer, had need enter with great
cautiousness and watchfulness, for the comes before a
God, who sees his Thoughts, takes notice of his Designs,
and knows the secret recesses of his Soul, observes his
Looks, and Postures, and Behaviour, and will at last call
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:103387:22"/>
him to an account for his carelesness and irreverence.
Were these things seriously thought of, how could the
generality of us come into this House with no greater
awe, and with as loose Affections, as if they were going
to a Play? How durst we stare about in Prayer? How
could we let our Thoughts rove and wander, while we
seem to be engaged in Devotion? How could we hear
with that indifferency? How could we apply our selves
to the Duties required of us, with that coldness, which
is so visible in most Congregations? How could we turn
our Services into mere Formalities, and stand before
the great God unconcerned, and return from his House
without a relish of the Mysteries of Godliness? To see
what decency and gravity Men observe in the Presence
of a Prince, and to think, how little regard we have to
the Presence of a Glorious God, in the House, which
he is pleased to call his Tabernacle and Dwelling-place,
is enough to make the Holy Angels conclude, that in
the midst of his Temple we are Infidels; to see, how su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinely
some sit at their Prayers, as if they were pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to a Stock or Stone; to see how others compose
themselves to sleep, as if the God they come to worship,
with <hi>Baal,</hi> were asleep too, and they came to honour
him with that posture; to see, how some come to shew
their Bravery here, and to be seen and taken notice of,
and to be admired by Spectators; to see, how others
strive for Places, for Superiority, and the chief Seats
in these Synagogues, and there vent their Pride, their
Anger, and their Malice, where they ought to express
their greatest Humility and Charity; to see how others
talk here of their worldly Concerns, or if they do not
talk of them, act and behave themselves as if they
thought of nothing else, where they are to mind only
the great concerns of their immortal Souls: to see all
this, what can we infer, but that Men have no Sense
of the Tremendous Majesty on High? No sense of
the Mysteries, the very Angels desire to look into?
These things, <hi>My Brethren,</hi> ought not so to be: When
therefore thou goest to the Temple of the Lord, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:103387:23"/>
the Magnificence of that God, at whose Footstool
thou goest to worship: When thou enter'st in at the
door of this House, leave there thy Worldly thoughts
and Carnal desires, and come fill'd with the Spirit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Tabernacle of the Lord: Sit, and Stand, and
Kneel there, as before the Searcher of all Hearts; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
to come away from thence edified, and with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
store of Spiritual Blessings than thou hadst before.
In praying, fix thy Thoughts upon Him who heareth
Prayer; and if thou dost, thou canst not but appear in
such a posture, as doth best express thy inward sense
of his Greatness and Holiness. In hearing, apply the
general Admonitions, and Exhortations, and Reproofs,
to thine own Soul. In Reading, make some spiritual
reflection on the Examples, Precepts, Promises, that
are before thee. In singing, mind the Matter more
than the Tune, and let thy Heart bear part in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise.
In receiving the Supper of the Lord, let not the
outward humble posture be all the Service thou per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formest,
but fix the eyes of thy Understanding upon the
Cross, and there contemplate the Mercy that flows from
it, and from thence take Fire and Courage to abound
in love to God and Man. At thy going in, beg of
God to prepare thy Heart: At thy coming out, beg
that thou may'st not lose the things, that have been
wrought in thee; and this is <hi>to keep thy foot when thou
goest into the House of God.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>O</hi> Thou, in whose Temple every Man speaks of thine Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
whose Glory no mortal Man can sufficiently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press,
whose Goodness no Tongue is able to display, whose Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
transcends all the Perfections we see here below! Overawe
my Spirit, when I go with the multitude to the House of God,
with the voice of Joy and Praise: O let me consider, it is the
All-seeing God, in whose Presence I stand, and that the Holy
Angels are sent to observe my Devotion. Give me sober
Thoughts, holy Affections, devout postures, steddiness of Mind,
ardent Desires, modest Looks, a grave Behaviour, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
when I am going to contemplate the precious Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
offered by the Son of God for the Sins of the World; let
all that is within me turn into holy breathings; represent that
comfortable Object in lively Characters to my Understanding,
that I may think nothing unworthy of my Saviour; banish from
me all undecent Thoughts, or if thou dost not think fit to free
me from Temptations, encourage me however, to resist them
vigorously, that I may discover my Zeal for thy Glory, by my
abhorrency of all Imaginations, that exalt themselves against
the Obedience of Christ Jesus. <hi>Amen.</hi>

            <head type="sub">Of Eating the Lord's Supper. The Nature of it,
and how it is to be Eaten.</head>
            <argument>
               <head>The CONTENTS.</head>
               <p>A great difference betwixt coming to the Lord's Supper, and
Eating the Lord's Supper. Several Reasons, why Men come
though they do not Eat, as they ought to do. What Eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Lord's Supper is, viz. To Eat it with a relish of
the Benefits of Christ's Death, with longings to be conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to Christ in his Graces, and to Eat it with unfeigned
Resolutions to resist Temptations. Much depends upon the
manner of any Religious Performance. Conversation with
God, with our selves, and with the Holy Angels, a great
means to Eat, as we ought to Eat. The Prayer.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>I. THat there are many who come to the Lord's
Supper, and yet Eat not the Lord's Supper, as
they ought to do, is evident from Experience, and will
appear more fully in the sequel of this Discourse, when
we shall tell you, what it is to Eat and Drink unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
When some of the looser sort of the <hi>Corinthian
Christians, 1 Cor. 11. 20.</hi> came drunk to this Sacrament,
it's certain, they only eat <hi>the Bread of the Lord,</hi> but not
<hi>the Bread, the Lord,</hi> as the Fathers speak; and if <hi>Simon
Magus Acts 8. 13.</hi> came to this Feast, as I am apt to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
he did, for in those days, they that were baptized
were soon after admitted to the Lord's Supper, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
from <hi>Act. 2. 41, 42.</hi> this must necessarily have been
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:103387:24"/>
his case; and who can doubt of this Truth, that in the
Age we live in, sees so many come to this Royal Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
and go away unreformed, untouch'd, and unconcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?
than which, there cannot be a greater sign, that
they do not eat the Supper of the Lord, though they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach,
and feed upon the External Elements: And
Men may very easily know it, by such Marks as these,</p>
            <p>1. <hi>If they come without any sense of the designs, Christ
had in Instituting this Sacrament,</hi> one of which certainly
was, to engage us to the generous <hi>contempt of the World,</hi> in
imitation of him, who for the Glory set before him;
not only undervalued the Pomp and Grandeur of the
World, but <hi>endured the Cross,</hi> and <hi>despised the shame,</hi> as we
are told, <hi>Heb. 12. 2.</hi> And when we see Men, and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
approach the Table of the Lord, with all the Gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
and Gayeties, their vain desires prompt them to,
like <hi>Ranters</hi> rather than <hi>Penitents:</hi> more like soft <hi>Syba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites</hi>
than frighted <hi>Disciples;</hi> dressed to allure Mens eyes
more, than to invite the <hi>Crucified Jesus</hi> into their Souls;
like players rather than like <hi>Christians:</hi> And when we
see, how the very next day after this Feast, if they stay
so long, they quarrel, fight, contend, and fall out about
the trifles of the World; run to Theatres, and Play-houses,
and with as great greediness as ever, pursue the
Riches and Glories, and Fashions of the World, how
can we imagine, that such Persons came with the sense
of the aforementioned design of Christ, in instituting
this Sacred Feast?</p>
            <p>2. <hi>If they come without any sense of the love of God,</hi> of
which, there is so curious a Picture drawn in this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as is enough to make even the most hard hearted
Heathen weep: And what sense of this Love can we sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to have been in Men, when after their Receiving,
they do not so much as look into a Bible, to see what
Precepts, and Commands of <hi>Christ,</hi> they mean for the
future to be more observant of? Is it possible such Men
had sense of the Love of God upon their Spirits that
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:103387:25"/>
day they receiv'd the Holy Elements, when the next day
they offend him as boldly as ever, and hug the same sins
they entertained several years before, and are now as
little concerned to please God, as they were some Months
ago? and consequently such Persons come to the Lord's
Supper, yet do not eat, as they ought to do; for none
eat it truly, but such as eat with this sense; and where
this sense is, it will make the Soul cautious of offending
God.</p>
            <p>II. Yet such Guests are very common at this Table,
which would make a wise Man wonder, why they will
come at all, when their coming signifies so little, and,
as will appear afterward, doth them more harm than
good. Yet the Reasons may easily be guess'd at: For,</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Conviction brings them to it.</hi> They are convinced,
that coming is a commanded Duty, not a thing indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
and that they may not seem dispisers and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of so great a Law, they come, though they put
strange Fire in their Censers; Conviction hath great
power even upon unregenerate Men: It made <hi>Felix</hi>
tremble, <hi>Acts 24 25.</hi> and <hi>Judas</hi> throw down the Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Pieces of Silver, the reward of his Treason, in the
Temple, <hi>Matth. 27. 4.</hi> and <hi>Simon</hi> embrace Christian Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism,
<hi>Act. 8. 13.</hi> And where a Man is teazed and haunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by his Conscience, he'll do something to stop his
mouth; and though he doth it but slovenly, yet he'll
bribe Conscience with this trifle, as we do Children,
that cry for a Jewel, with a Rattle; and in this manner
Conviction Works upon some Men and Women, and
that force puts several upon coming to the Lord's
Table.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Their Office and Employment,</hi> obliges them to receive,
and that makes not a few appear at this Table. The
Law of the Land excluding Men from publick Offices
and Charges, that receive not the Communion; we may
very justly believe, that abundance come to satisfie the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:103387:25"/>
Statute more than their Conscience; and fear of losing
or missing of the Office, they are ambitious of, hath a
stronger influence upon them, than the fear of losing
God's Favour; not but that a man may Eat the Lord's
Supper to his great comfort and edification, because an
<hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi> commands it, at his entrance upon an
Office; for a man, who fears God, may make use of
any occasion to receive, and consequently may make
his present Office an opportunity of coming to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
But I speak my just fears, that many receive on
this account, whom neither Love to God nor to their
own Souls, could have obliged to come, had it not been
for such forcible means, or straits and necessities; so that
the Minister of the Ordinance may thank their Office
more than their Religion, that he sees them in that holy
place: And most certainly this is not Eating the Lord's
Supper; for nothing is properly an act of Religion, but
what is a free-will-offering, and flows from an internal
love of the Duty. And what is here said of accidental
Employments, is too true of standing Offices of the
Church. A Minister, or Clergyman, may come to the
Lord's Supper, and yet not eat the Lord's Supper; he
may celebrate it as a Minister, and yet not eat it as a
sincere Christian; he may eat it, because his Office obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
him to administer it, and yet not eat it with that sense
which becomes a sincere believer: And it is so with lesser
Officers about a Church; Custom may carry them a
great way, and for some years they may never fail to
come to this Table, and yet may not eat as they ought;
for they may do it upon the account of their Office only,
and because it is expected of them; but the sense of the
end, and of the love of God, may be wanting, which
defect makes it a very lame offering.</p>
            <p>3, Such Men however come, and to this they are led
by a fancy they are willing to entertain, that other Men,
who come, receive it with no greater sense or seriousness
than they. They consider not, whether this will be a
good Plea another day; but it gives present satisfaction,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:103387:26"/>
and this makes them espouse it. Not to mention, that
it is great rashness and presumption in them, to judge of
other Mens hearts, the secrets of which, they are for the
most part ignorant of; and if other men should be no
better than they, yet that would be no excuse, Men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to live by Precepts, not by every Example that is
before them; yet thus Men love to delude themselves,
and by that means precipitate themselves into unspeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Dangers: For</p>
            <p>III. This not eating as they ought, strangely hardens
them in Sin. If the Cross of Christ cannot open their
eyes, or make them sensible of their Errors, few things
can be supposed able to do it to their comfort. If the
Blood of the Covenant cannot supple their hearts, other
things must be believed to be ineffectual, because God
looks upon this as the most potent remedy to effect it;
nor is this to be understood only of scandalous sins, but
all such offences which Christ hath peremptorily forbid,
though the world takes no great notice of them, such
as are aversion from holy Thougts and Discourses, and
neglect of those Gospel Graces the <hi>Apostle</hi> presses upon
such as would not be Christians in vain. And hence it
is, that where Men do not eat the Lord's Supper aright,
our Exhortations to those nobler Duties of Religion are
lost upon them, and all the severe threatnings we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearse
and mention, to rouze them from their Spiritual
slumber, are spoke into the wind, and they continue
strangers to that Spiritual frame, which the Apostle calls,
<hi>Rom. 8. 5. minding the things of the Spirit.</hi> By a Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
frame of the heart, I mean a God-like Temper, which
is pleased with any thing that makes for the Glory of
God; and as Fire converts all things into its own sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
spiritualizeth Objects, or makes a spiritual use of
them, and is truly enamoured with the severer Precepts
of the Gospel, and looks upon them as perfective of our
natures, and consequently thinks no Commandment
grievous. Hence it is that such Men, who are strangers
to this frame, their Religion turns into mere Formality
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:103387:26"/>
and Hypocrisie; and however it may look in their own
eyes, in the sight of God it goes for no more than Paint
and Varnish, mere Glow-worm light, that shines, but
warms not; glitters, but gives no Heat; blazes, but doth
not touch the Heart; and, like rotten Wood, seems
bright, but hath nothing of Fire in it; and this must
necessarily cause very false Applications of Gospel Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,
which at last produces such Self-deceptions, that
when they come to appear before the Bar of God's Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
they'll not only wonder at the Cheats they have
put upon themselves, but tear their hair, and smite their
breasts, and be ready to kill themselves, to think how
they have murthered their own Souls with kindness, and
by fair Words and Speeches, enticed them into ruin.</p>
            <p>IV. From what we have said, it will easily appear,
what eating of the Lord's Supper doth import, eating it,
I mean in a Scripture Sense.</p>
            <p>1. To eat it with a relish of the Benefits of Christ's
Death and Passion; even in our common Meals, we find
a great difference betwixt eating and relishing, betwixt
eating with and without an Appetite, betwixt tasting the
juice and delicacy of the Meat, and fancying it to be no
better than Chaulk or Ashes: He that eats the Lord's Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
aright, his Soul must eat as well as his outward Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans;
and as Christ saith <hi>John 6. 63. The words that I
speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life;</hi> so the Soul
that eats, as it should do, the benefits of Christ's Death,
they must be Life and Spirit to her, a perfect Cordial,
true Elixir, real Sweetness, comfortable Balm, and sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
than Honey to the Palate. These Benefits are Pardon
and Peace, and reconciliation to God, and Salvation,
and the Soul must be affected with them, prize them,
value them practically above the Riches of the World,
and count all things dross and dung, for the excellency
of them; and be willing to part rather with Father and
Mother, and Lands and Houses, than with the Comforts
of them, and that is to relish, and then the Soul eats in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed;
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:103387:27"/>
whereas a person that either thinks not of these
Benefits, or, if he thinks of them, hath no actual value for
them, so as to feel in himself how highly he esteems them,
and what a mighty veneration he hath for them, though
he may be said to eat, yet he doth not relish them, and
therefore doth not eat aright.</p>
            <p>2. It is to eat with secret longings to be conformable
to Christ Jesus in his Humility and Charity, or as the
Apostle expresses it, to have the <hi>same mind in us, which
was also in Christ Jesus,</hi> Phil. 2. 5. And this in another
place is called <hi>hungring and thirsting after righteousness,</hi>
Matth. 5. 6. and was represented of old by the secret
longings of the Spouse, <hi>Cant. 1. 3. Draw me after thee
and I will run.</hi> Where there is no such longing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
to Christ in these Virtues, a Man doth not proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
eat the Lord's Supper like a healthy man, for he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gests
not, the Food doth not turn into good Juice it doth
not nourish him, he doth not thrive upon it. I call it
longing, for the desire after these Graces, which were so
eminent in Christ, must be strong and vehement, ardent,
and grounded upon the Beauty, Loveliness, and Amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness
of them; such a longing as <hi>David</hi> expressed for
the Lord's House and his Word: <hi>As the Hart panteth after
the Water-brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God,</hi> Psal.
42, 1. <hi>How amiable are thy Tabernacles, O Lord of Hosts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
My Soul longeth, yea even fainteth for the courts of the Lord,</hi>
Psal. 84. 1, 2. <hi>My soul breaketh for the longing that it hath
unto thy righteous judgments at all times.</hi> And though I
grant something of an Hyperbole in those Phrases, yet
still they import, that his desires were strong, hearty and
vehement; and such must be the desires of the Soul in
eating the Lord's Supper, to be conformable to her Lord
and Master.</p>
            <p>3. It is to eat with unfeigned resolutions, to resist all
known temptations to those particular this we are most
prone and inclined to; this shews; that we eat with an
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> to grow strong, and that this is a true <hi>Sacrament</hi> to
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:103387:27"/>
us, or a <hi>Vow,</hi> whereby we tie our selves to be faithful to our
General, and to fight against his Enemies. Many a man,
that comes to the Lord's Supper, feels some faint reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions
against Sin in general, but that works upon him
no more than sparks of Fire serve to warm a frozen man;
and therefore it's necessary, that, in eating, a Christian
should feel invincible resolutions to subdue those particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
sins he is most apt to fall or rush into, and to which
his Calling, Employment, Converse and Figure in the
World, doth most solicite and tempt him, else he beats
the Air, and fights with shadows; and if he doth not
single out those Enemies that are most apt to do him mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief,
resolution to fight against the powers of Darkness
in general gives these unregarded sins, that do him most
hurt, opportunity to live secure, and to keep possession
of what they have already got into their clutches.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The Preceeding Considerations reduced to Practice.</head>
               <p>I. THE manner of any Religious performance makes
it either pleasing or displeasing to God: This turns
the scales; and two acts of Piety which seem to be the
same, many times are not, because the manner of the
performance makes a vast difference in the value. The
examples of the <hi>Publican</hi> and the <hi>Pharisee</hi> praying in the
Temple, and <hi>Abel</hi>'s and <hi>Cain</hi>'s offering Sacrifices, are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
instances of this truth. <hi>David</hi> pays his Vows, <hi>Psal.
66. 13.</hi> So doth the Harlot mention'd in <hi>Prov. 7. 14.</hi>
The former is <hi>precious</hi> in the sight of God, the later <hi>odious;</hi>
the reason is, the former proceeded from a sense of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
and a relish of the Sweetness of God's Service;
the other from a base design to compensate God for the
sins the strange Woman lived and delighted in. It is so
in eating the <hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> and as St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith of the
Jews, <hi>They are not all Israel which are of Israel, neither be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they are the Seed of Abraham are they all children,</hi> Rom.
9. 6, 7. so all that seem to eat of the Lord's Supper do
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:103387:28"/>
not therefore eat to the same purpose; some eat as <hi>Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi>
others as <hi>Children;</hi> some as <hi>Strangers,</hi> others as <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mesticks;</hi>
some as <hi>Slaves,</hi> others as <hi>Heirs</hi> of the Promise.
Look to the manner of thy Eating, <hi>Christian.</hi> Eat like
a person that is sensible he sits down at the Table of the
greatest Prince, the Prince himself being present. Eat
like a person sensible, that the King, in whose presence
thou art, is thy best and greatest Friend: Eat like a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
sensible, that thou hast deserved to sup with Devils,
to feed on Flames, and to drink the Dregs of the Cup
of God's anger. Eat like a person sensible, that from
the condition of a miserable Slave, thou art advanced to
the Dignity of a Child and Son of God. Eat like a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
sensible, that no merit, no desert of thine, nothing
but the incomprehensible Goodness of God, hath brought
thee to this Honour and Prerogative, and it's impossible
thou canst eat amiss; for this sense will oblige thee to
eat with joy and trembling, which is the most proper
Devotion for a Creature to express in the presence of
his Creator.</p>
               <p>II. Conversation is a great means to do things as we
ought. He that converses with men of his own Trade,
will learn how to manage it to his advantage. He that
converses with great Persons, learns how to please them.
He that converses with ingenious Workmen, learns to do
things to his and other's satisfaction. The same Rule is
to be observed in eating the <hi>Lord's Supper;</hi> and he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but eat it to God's liking, and his own comfort, that
before he eats converses with himself, and while he is
eating, converses with God, and after he hath eaten,
converses with the holy Angels.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>1. Conversing with our selves before we eat, consists
in asking our Hearts,</hi> What have I done? What sins are
those, that I am apt to lodge in my Bosom? What evil desires
am I ready to entertain? What disorders, what corruptions
find countenance, or approbation in my Soul? Is it revenge?
Is it rendring railing for railing? Is it frothy discourses? Is it
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:103387:28"/>
vain Romantick Imaginations? Is it weariness of God's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice?
Is it backwardness to Holy Duties? Is it unwillingness to
to know the Will of God? Is it discontent in the condition I
am in? Is it intemperance in Eating, and Drinking? Is it a
desire of Vain-glory? Is it sudden Anger? Is it Impatience,
or Worldly sorrow? Is it Grief and vexation, that I cannot
have my Will in such outward things, as my Appetite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires?
Is it Lov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> and Affection to the Vanities of this World?
What dangerous Guests are those? And shall I entertain them?
What are these but Enemies to the Cross? And shall I make
much of them? or let them go out and in without controul?
Either these Corruptions must be gone, or my Saviour will not
stay with me. Shall I with the Jews, refuse my great Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers
company, and desire a <hi>Barabbas?</hi> I am now going to
the Cross of Christ, and shall I approach with these Ensigns
of Rebellion in my Soul? Will Christ vouchsafe a favourable
Look to me, where he sees such Satyrs dance? I am going to
Mount <hi>Calvary,</hi> and shall these menstruous rags be my Attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance?
No, no, I will not loose Heaven for this! I will set my Face
against these Foes; I will let them see, that there is something dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
to me, than their Presence, or Company, even he, who laid
down his life for me. These Bryers and Thorns shall not stop
my way. Away ye evil Spirits, you have haunted me long e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough;
I'll be afraid of you no longer: I'll take courage, and
fight against you; for God is on my side, Why should I fear
in the day of Trouble?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2. Conversing with God, when we Eat, imports con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templating,
what God hath done for us in</hi> Christ Jesus;
<hi>how God was in</hi> Christ <hi>reconciling the World to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
not imputing their Trespasses unto them; for in
this Contemplation the Soul addresses her self to God,</hi>
O my God, what cost and charges hast thou been at, to redeem
such a Wretch as I am! How hast thou bow'd the Heavens!
Lord, thou didst make thy self a Curse for me, that I might
be advanc'd to bliss! I see what a costly thing my Salvation is,
since to purchase it, the Son of God did die! Yet how light do
I make of Heaven! O God what moved thee to love me thus?
And shall I think any thing to dear to part with for thy sake? In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:103387:29"/>
what Labyrinths do I run my self, while I am mine own
Keeper<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Thou hast paid dear for thy right to rule and govern
me! and shall I after all, be loath to be govern'd by so Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
a Master? Here I make an offering of my Heart, if
thou wilt but vouchsafe to accept of it; it is a Present unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of thy Greatness and Majesty, yet thou art pleased to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
no other sacrifice: Hence forward speak, Lord, and thy
Servant will hear; and when the Characters of thy Mercy
wear out, or decay in my unconstant Soul, Lord! write them
there afresh; write them with the Blood of Christ, that they
may be everlasting, and may be an Eternal fence to me against
the suggestions and persuasions of thine Enemies.</p>
               <p>3. Conversing with the Holy Angels, after we have
eaten, requires imitation of them in their Praises and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience.
<hi>Bless the Lord, ye his Angels, that excel in strength,
that do his commandments, hearken to the voice of his word,</hi>
saith the Psalmist, <hi>Psal. 103. 20.</hi> Praise and Obedience
are inseparable Virtues, the one without the other makes
<hi>dull Musick</hi> in the Ears of God. Let no Man think,
that because Angels are invisible Spirits, and afar off,
there is no conversing with them: He that doth their
work, is their Companion, their Brother, and their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar;
with such they love to be, such persons they love
to visit, and he that doth so may be as confident, they
are on his right hand, as if he saw them, for God hath
said so, <hi>Psal. 34. 7.</hi> and therefore it must be true, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
our carnal eyes behold them or no. Praising, is not
only to offer up a Psalm or Hymn, after we have eaten,
but living in a sense of the love of God; and he that doth
so, cannot but be obedient and faithful to him, that hath
so signally manifested his mercy in his Misery.</p>

Make the food of sin odious and bitter to me. I have fed too

Spirit. Raise it above this dull and Corruptible Flesh, that it
may triumph over its base desires. Bring thou back my Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity,
and let my Chains fall off. Let the Liberty of thy
Children, which consists in a chearful going on from virtue,
to virtue be my delight and ornament, so shall the King take
pleasure in my Beauty, and my Soul shall rejoyce in Thee for
ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>

            <head type="sub">Of the various abuses of this Holy Sacrament.</head>
            <argument>
               <head>The CONTENTS.</head>
               <p>The most Sacred things in all ages have been abused. Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
drawn from the brazen Serpent, Gideon's Ephod, and
the Love-Feasts of the Primitive Christians. Abuses of Holy
things rise from several causes. The Lords Supper hath
undergone the same fate. The Holier any thing is, that is
abused, the greater is the Crime. A great abuse of this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Sacrament, is to fancy, that like a spell, it will Charm
sin, out of our Souls, without strong endeavours. The abuses
committed in this Sacrament, no just Temptation to neglect
the use of it. The Prayer.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>I. THere is nothing so sacred or holy, but hath been,
and may still be, abused by sensual Men. <hi>Moses,
Numb. 21. 8.</hi> by God's special Appointment, erects a
<hi>fiery Serpent,</hi> or a Serpent of <hi>Polished Brass,</hi> shining bright
as Fire, a <hi>symbol</hi> of God's Presence and Power to heal
the tormented <hi>Israelites,</hi> who had been stung by fiery
Serpents; insomuch, that if any of the persons, thus
stung, look'd upon the Figure, he actually recovered:
So remarkable a History, depending upon this brazen
Serpent, it was laid up for a Monument; yet, in process
of time, this became an object of Idolatry, which mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<hi>Hezekiah</hi> to break it in pieces, and call it <hi>Nehushtan,
2 Kings, 18. 4.</hi> The very same happen'd to <hi>Gideon</hi>'s E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phod,
<hi>Judg. 8. 27.</hi> a thing innocently enough contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:103387:30"/>
and in all probability piously intended as a stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
testimony to future Ages, what a signal Victory God
had given his People over the barbarous <hi>Midianites;</hi> yet
after his Death, when with his Life his Power and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
over the bruitish People were gone, they went a
whoring after it, <hi>i. e.</hi> fell to worship it, an accident which
proved the ruine of <hi>Gideon</hi>'s Family, and of thousands
besides in <hi>Israel.</hi> What could be more innocent than the
<hi>Love-Feasts</hi> in the Primitive Church? Mention is made
of them <hi>Jud.</hi> vers. 12. They were Feasts made in the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratories,
or places where the Primitive Christians used
to assemble for the Celebration of Divine Worship, and
at the charge of such as were well to pass, or richer than
the rest; to these the poorer sort were invited, and sat
down at the Table with the rich, ate with them, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
the Leavings or Fragments home; and this being
done with great expressions of Love, and managed with
singular Meekness, Charity, and Humility, with bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly
Familiarity, and with holy Discourses, without
Excess or Intemperance, and all sanctified by Prayers and
Psalms and reading the Holy Scriptures, the Apostles both
permitted and encouraged these pious Collations; and
after them, their Hearts being thus impregnated with
Charity, they applied themselves to the Use and Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration
of the <hi>Eucharist:</hi> That which gave occasion to
these <hi>Love-Feasts,</hi> was either Christ's eating the <hi>Passover</hi>
with his Disciples immediately before the Communion,
or the custom of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who used to eat and drink to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in some Chamber or Building adjoyning to the
Temple, when they offered their Sacrifices, or, which is
more probable, from the antient custom of the <hi>Grecians,</hi>
who having brought rich Guifts, they intended for their
Gods, to the Temple, converted them into Feasts of
Charity, to which the Poor as well as the Rich sat down,
and all ate together, no respect of Persons being observed
at that time; which Practice, not a few Christians, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
lately crept out of the darkness of <hi>Heathenism,</hi> it's
like retained, changing only the Object of their Worship,
and doing that to the Honour of the true God, which
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:103387:31"/>
the <hi>Pagans</hi> did to their false and imaginary Deities. Yet
see the abuse of these <hi>Feasts of Charity, 1 Cor. 11. 22.</hi> espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> in the days of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles.
For St. <hi>Paul</hi> being busie abroad, partly in Planting,
partly in Confirming Churches, the richer sort of the
Christians at <hi>Corinth</hi> began to think it below them to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
the poor to that Familiarity as to eat with them in
these charitable Collations; and therefore, either promp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by their own Pride, or encouraged by some false
Teachers, that had Mens Persons in admiration because
of advantage, would indeed send the Meat and Drink
they had prepared, to those Oratories or places of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
worship; but when they came, they superciliously
separated themselves from the Poorer sort, and ate and
drank by themselves, and so freely, that many of them
became drunk, and in that condition had the hellish
impudence afterward to come to the holy Sacrament: If
they left any thing at these Feasts, the Poor might take it,
and make the best of it; if not, they were forced to go
away hungry, and too often discontented. So early grew
this abuse; and though in Process of time these Feasts
were used after the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> and in many places in
Church-yards, at the celebration of the Memories of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Martyrs,</hi> at the Dedication of Churches, and at the
Funerals of holy Men and Women; yet nothing could
keep out Intemperance, and Excess, and Disorders; for
which reason, the Church at last thought herself obliged
to abolish and put them down, which was done accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
by the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> in the Year of our Lord
364. by the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Carthage</hi> in the Year 419. and by
the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Constantinople</hi> in the Year 692.</p>
            <p>II. Whence Abuses of Holy things arise, is no hard
matter to guess: for,</p>
            <p>1. We find them spring from an <hi>Itch</hi> of <hi>Novelty,</hi> Men
not contented with the plain and simple Truths, God
hath vouchsafed to Mankind, are strangely tickled with
new things, which are often called Refinings, or Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:103387:31"/>
of old Truths, under which plausible name
they are easily swallowed down. Hence rose the various
<hi>Idolatries</hi> in the World, that it became as modish to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
new Gods, as it was, to invent new Fashions in
Cloaths, and Habits; <hi>Adam</hi> no doubt deliver'd the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of one Eternal, invisible God, Creator of Heaven
and earth, and the decent worship of him, to his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity.
This notion being become common and stale,
the succeeding Ages thought themselves obliged to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
something new, and counted it more gay and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
to worship the Creator in the Creature; and see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Sun, and Moon, and Stars, that they were the
brightest Monuments of God's Power, they easily fell
into the Worship of those Luminaries, till the more bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish
among the People adored them as Gods indeed;
and this novelty once broach'd, one God brought in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
and as Men were still fond of Novelties, so they
went on, and fell a Worshipping deceased Hero's and
Princes, in whom the Image of the Supreme Deity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sided,
and who had been famous for some notable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits,
or benefits; and from hence they still went on,
even to the Worshipping of Trees, Herbs, Plants, Beasts,
Crocodils, Fishes, and creeping things, one Age still
thinking to out-do the other in new inventions of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of Worship, till it came to pass, that those were
counted most Religious, that Worshipt the greatest num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Gods, as the <hi>Athenians,</hi> who had more Gods
than any one City besides, of which, the <hi>Apostle</hi> takes
notice, <hi>Acts 17. 22, 23.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Another cause of these abuses, is, an Opinion,
<hi>That God is pleased more with the Externals, than the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals
of Religion,</hi> an Opinion, which Men are very apt
to slide into, because they find the Internal Devotion is
troublesome, and requires intention of the Mind, and
mortification of the Affections, and the other is more
easily performed. To this Original, the Corruptions
that did over-spread the <hi>Jewish Church,</hi> owe their rise,
who in despight of all the Warnings of the Prophets to
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:103387:32"/>
the contrary, laid the stress of their Piety on the strict
observations of their Sabbaths, new Moons, Sacrifices,
Phylacteries, and legal Purifications. This gave <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi>
occasion to corrupt Religion; for knowing what
would please the sensual inclinations of Men, he craftily
drew People away from the Internal Worship and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration
of the Souls and Affections to the Supreme
Being, and taught them to place all Devotion in these
five external Acts of Worship, <hi>Saying their Prayers five
times a day, keeping the Mouth</hi> Ramasan, <hi>giving the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dredth
part of their incomes to Pious uses, Washing before
Prayer, and making a Pilgrimage, if possible, to</hi> Mecca:
And thus the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> at this day, comes to
deviate from the true Religion, not only by adding new
Articles, of Faith to the antient Creeds, but by turning
the whole Worship of God, in a manner, into Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,
and external Services, <hi>Saying so many</hi> Ave-Maries,
<hi>visiting such a Saint's Shrine, Processions, offering
Wax-Candles to the Virgin, Praying by Beads, undergoing
Penances,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>3. A Third cause of these abuses, is, a <hi>mistake of Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi>
and <hi>Passion, for true Religion and Revelation.</hi> From
hence have come all the barbarous attempts of Pretenders
to the true Religien, against Magistrates, and a well
setled Church and State; From hence have risen all
those <hi>Enthusiastical conceits,</hi> both in this and former Ages,
whereby the Gospel it self hath been in danger of being
overthrown; From hence come those rude and undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested
Notions of <hi>Hildegard, Bridget, Catharine</hi> of <hi>Siena,
Teresa, St. Francis,</hi> and others in <hi>Popery,</hi> who by their
Dreams and Visions have sought to establish the errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Doctrines of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church; From hence it was,
that the <hi>Messaliani</hi> of Old pretended, and made People
believe, that upon a Man's Regeneration, or being purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from Sin, the Devil and his Angels came out of his
Mouth in the shape of Swine. To say no more, in Men,
and Women, whose notions of Religion are crude, and
undigested, and who are made up of a strong Fancy,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:103387:32"/>
and stronger Passions, Religion must needs run into
Wild-fire, and pervert the simplicity of the Gospel.</p>
            <p>4. A Fourth Cause, is <hi>suiting Religion to our own Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
Lusts and Interest.</hi> The <hi>Tartars</hi> therefore embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Religion, and rejected the <hi>Christian,</hi>
because the former gave greater liberty to the Flesh.
This made the <hi>Heathens</hi> invent to themselves <hi>Deities,</hi> that
were favourers of their Vices; And from hence it was,
that in the Primitive Church, <hi>Basilides, Carpocrates, Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentinus,</hi>
the <hi>Nicolaitans,</hi> and <hi>Archonticks,</hi> denied the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of a Holy Life, because they loved to wallow,
like Swine in the Mire; and in all probability, upon
this ground it was, that <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Philetus,</hi> as the
Apostle informs us, <hi>2 Tim. 17, 18.</hi> affirm'd, and gave
out, that the Resurrection was already past, because they
were loath to be called to an account for their evil
lives.</p>
            <p>5. False Teachers <hi>and</hi> turbulent Souls, <hi>are another cause.
Discontented Men, because they cannot be Great or
Rich, or have their Will in the Church, under whose
Government they live, to revenge themselves, many
times will poison the Doctrine, make Proselites, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
to become great by doing mischief, since they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be so by lawful means: To such persons we owe
the Heresies of</hi> Marcion, <hi>of</hi> Novatus, <hi>of</hi> Arius, <hi>of the</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natists,
<hi>and others; and it's no more than what</hi> St. Paul
<hi>hath told us long ago, for,</hi> the time will come, when they
will not endure sound Doctrine, but after their own lusts, shall
heap to themselves Teachers, having itching Ears, <hi>2 Tim.
4. 3. And to this purpose</hi> St. Peter, <hi>2 Pet. 2. 1, 2, 3.
But</hi> there were false Prophets also among the people, even as
there shall be false Teachers among you, who privily shall bring
in damnable Heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them,
and bring upon themselves swift destruction; And many shall
follow their pernicious way, by reason of whom the Truth
shall be evil spoken of, and through covetousness shall they,
with feigned words make Merchandize of you, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:103387:33"/>
III. Nor hath the <hi>Sacrament of the Lord's Supper</hi> fared
better, than other Religious Institutions; for this, in all
Ages, hath had its share in the abuses of foolish Men;
and while they forgot to fix their Eyes upon the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Nature and design of it, have entertained gross and
carnal apprehensions concerning it: The <hi>Corinthians</hi> ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
early abated in their esteem and reverence of it, as
appears from the latter part of <hi>1 Cor. 11.</hi> The <hi>Pepuziani</hi>
and <hi>Collyridianes,</hi> Hereticks, suffer'd their Women to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister
this Holy Sacrament: The <hi>Ebionites</hi> used Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
instead of Wine, in imitation of the <hi>Athenian</hi> and
Heathenish Sacrifices, which were therefore called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<hi>Sober and without Wine:</hi> The <hi>Montanists, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphrygians</hi>
and <hi>Gnosticks</hi> proceeded to that tremendous
barbarity in this Sacrament, that they took a Child of a
year old, and pricked it with Pins and Needles, and
drew a considerable quantity of Blood from it, which
Blood they mingled with the Meal or Flower, of which
they made the Sacramental Bread. The Child, if it dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
after these Torments, was counted a Martyr; if it
survived them, they gave it the respect and veneration
of a Priest; and all these horrid practices came mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
from hence, because they stupidly thought, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Blood was necessary in this Ordinance. Some other
Villanies they committed, which modesty bids me to
conceal. The <hi>Artotyritae;</hi> another sort of Hereticks,
made use of Bread and Cheese in this Sacrament, and
to this they were led by a fancy, that because the first
Inhabitants in the World offered to God the First Fruits
of the Earth, and particularly the Milk of their Sheep
and Kine, they were obliged to do so too. The <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saliani</hi>
made this Sacrament an indifferent thing, and
gave out, that it neither promoted nor hindred Man's
Salvation; an Error which the <hi>Quakers</hi> have taken up
at this day. Nor were they only profess'd Hereticks
that committed these abuses, but the Popes of <hi>Rome,</hi> by
degrees, brought in abundance of needless Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
whereby this Plain and Heavenly Ordinance was
very much corrupted. Pope <hi>Alexander,</hi> about the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:103387:33"/>
Year of <hi>Christ 115,</hi> ordered, (what was indifferent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,)
that Wine should be mixt with Water in this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
and that no other Bread should be used but
unleaven'd Bread; that Holy Water mingled with Salt,
should be consecrated before the Eucharist, that the
Communicants, after they had receiv'd, might be sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with it. <hi>Sixtus,</hi> about the Year 125, ordered, that
no Nun, or Women, should touch the Holy Vessels, or
the Cloth of the Communion Table. <hi>Hyginus,</hi> about
the Year 140, enjoyn'd, that the Sacrament of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist
should ever be used, and celebrated at the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication
of Churches. <hi>Soter,</hi> about the Year 163, that
no Bishop or Priest should taste of any thing, before the
Communion, but abstain from all manner of Food, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they administred or received. <hi>Urban,</hi> about the
Year 230, ordained, that no other Vessels should be
used at the Communion, but either Golden, or Silver
ones; if the Church were poor, then Pewter should be
made use of. <hi>Felix,</hi> about the Year 277, ordered that the
Eucharist should be celebrated no where, but in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated
place. <hi>Sylvester,</hi> who lived about the Year
324, gave command, that the Altars on which the
Sacrament was celebrated, should be of Stone. <hi>Syricius,</hi>
about the Year 383, that no married Priest should cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate
or administer the Eucharist. <hi>Innocent,</hi> about the
Year 410, gave order, that the Names of those who had
given Alms at the Communion, should be rehears'd
and proclaim'd in the Church, at the celebration of
this Mystery; and that even Infants should be brought
to communicate in this Sacrament. <hi>Zosimus</hi> his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor,
enjoyn'd, that the Deacons, while the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was administring, should have their Hands cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with a Linen Cloth. Thus Superstition came in
by degrees; and while the People were taught an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Veneration of the Sacrament, they neglected the
fruits of Repentance, which the Worthy receiving, should
have produced in them. There was an ancient Custom
in the Christian Church, at the Communion, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearse
the Names of Martyrs, and their Glorious Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:103387:34"/>
and the Miracles they had wrought, both alive and
dead; from hence by degrees, crept in the unhappy
practice of Invocation of Saints, and Martyrs in the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist;</hi>
and this being once allowed of, the Doctrine of
Purgatory beginning to spread about <hi>St. Austin</hi>'s time,
and more universally about the time of <hi>Gregory the Great,</hi>
Men fell into an Opinion, that by the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> their
Names that were gone into Purgatory, being rehears'd,
their Souls might be delivered out of Purgatory; some
thought, that even the Souls of the Damned were in
some measure reliev'd by this unbloody Sacrifice: And
nothing is more common at this day, in the Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> than to say Masses for Souls in Purgatory;
a Doctrine they prove from the infirmities, errors, and
corrupt opinions of some of the Fathers, but which, the
Scripture doth not speak the least syllable of: Into such
abuses hath the World run, by deviating from the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity
of the Gospel. And that, which must be mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of grief and sorrow to all good Men, is, that this
Sacrament, which was intended as the <hi>Bond of Peace,</hi> is
made the Ball of Contention, and the Engine of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
the motive to Hatred, and the fire of Wrath and
Animosities: For this the <hi>Lutherans</hi> write Invectives a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the <hi>Calvinists,</hi> and the <hi>Papists</hi> against both; and
that which should have united all Men's Hearts, makes
them hate one another mortally; and no other reason
can be assigned for it, but Mens Pride and Passion, and
their other Vices. Who doth not tremble, that reads
the History of the <hi>Gunpowder-Treason,</hi> in which the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
was, without a Metaphor, made the <hi>Covenant
of Blood,</hi> and the Conspirators united by it, to be bold
and resolute in this Enterprize? Not to mention other
abuses of sensual and carnal Men, too frequent among
us, that can engage themselves in this Ordinance to
follow their Master's steps; and notwithstanding these
Engagements, live like Swine and Devils. Nor need
we wonder why God suffers these abuses, for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
them as he doth other sins, to let Men see at last,
that their Condemnation is just. Besides, this makes
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:103387:34"/>
those who use this Ordinance in pursuance of the right
end of its Institution, more glorious in God's Eyes, for
this hath still been the Privilege of the true Church of
God, to flourish like a Lilly among Thorns; and what
the <hi>Apostle</hi> saith of <hi>Heresie</hi> in general, is most true of
these Abuses, <hi>There must be such things in the World, that
those which are approved may be made manifest,</hi> 1 Cor.
11. 19.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The Preceding Considerations reduced to Practice.</head>
               <p>I. <hi>THE holier any thing is that is abused, the greater is
the Crime.</hi> When <hi>Belshazar, Dan. 5. 1.</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
to be drunk, had he made himself a Beast by
drinking out of common Cups, though the sin had been
great, and against Nature, yet it might have passed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punished
here, as other Villanies are; but when nothing
would serve his turn, but to drink his Reason and his
Wits away out of the Bowls of the Sanctuary, and to
add Profanation of the Vessels of the Lord's House to
all his Crimes, this allarmed the Divine Vengeance im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately;
and rather than not shew his Displeasure,
God thought himself obliged to be at the Charge of a
Miracle, which caused the fatal Hand upon the Wall,
and the King's Overthrow followed within a few hours
after: And if the Abuse of consecrated Vessels raised so
great a Storm, what must the abuse of consecrated Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and Duties, and Mercies do? <hi>Sirs,</hi> your Reason
is a consecrated thing, God hath set it apart for his use,
that you should consider and contrive how to get a share
among the Blessed hereafter; if you abuse it, and will
let it serve you for no other end, but to teach you how
you may grow rich and great, and fill your Bellies with
<hi>hid Treasures,</hi> will not God visit for these things? and will
not his Soul be avenged on such Persons? Your signal
Mercies and Deliverances are consecrated things, God
hath set them apart, to put you in mind of your Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:103387:35"/>
to teach you Submission to his Will, and to walk
humbly with your God; if after these you are careless,
and live as regardless of your Duty as you did before,
will not God reckon with you one day for such abuses?
Should a poor Man take the Cordial you send him, and
fling it upon a Dunghil, how would you resent it? and
can God like it, do you think, to see how like Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
you tear off the Cloaths he gives you, to cover
your Nakedness, to see you live the reverse of his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs,
to see you fight against him with his Mercies, and
as it was in the Case of the Daughter <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> Ezech.
16-17. to see you <hi>take the fair Jewels of Gold, and of
Silver he hath given you, and make to your selves Images
of Men, and commit fornication with them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>II. One great abuse of this Holy Sacrament, is, to
fancy, that like a spell, it will charm sin out of your
mortal Bodies, so that you need be at no trouble to
mortifie it. The Sacrament indeed confers Grace,
but it is objectively, as it contains very great Motives to
a lively Faith, and Hope, and Charity; and it confers
Grace too, as a cause, without which, Grace would not
be convey'd, because God hath promised in this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
to be present, and as the Dew of <hi>Hermon,</hi> or as
the Dew descends on the Mountains of <hi>Sion,</hi> so here the
Lord commands his Blessing, even life for evermore:
But still it doth not confer Grace <hi>Physically,</hi> as if the mere
use of it would make you Favourites of Heaven, and
Children of his Love. It's <hi>Physick</hi> indeed, which will
work a Cure, but then the Person that makes use of it
must be qualified for it, must be sensible, that he is sick, and
willing to be cured of his Spiritual Diseases, and then God
will look upon him, as a <hi>Father,</hi> and manifest himself
to him; look upon him, as a kind <hi>Physitian,</hi> and
make the Medicine effectual to him; look upon him as
a <hi>Friend,</hi> and take him into his bosom, and say to him,
as it is <hi>Es. 49. 8. In an acceptable time have I heard thee,
and in a day of Salvation have I helped thee, and I will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
thee, and cause thee to inherit the desolate Heritages.</hi>

III. The abuses committed by some in this Sacrament,
must not tempt us to neglect the use of it. If the abuse
that others have been guilty of, were a sufficient excuse
to stay away, we might as well argue, that Meat, and
Drink, and Cloaths, and Books, and Learning, may
not be used, because ill Men have perverted the harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
design of them. We should count that Man a fool,
that should resolve, because a Man of such a Profession
hath cheated him, therefore he will never deal with a
Man of that Profession again; or because such a Person,
who pretended to strictness of Religion, hath plaid the
knave with him, therefore he will never trust a Religious
Man again: The same absurdity would he commit,
that from the abuse that others have run into, in the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Communion, should resolve to abstain from it; for
this would be as much, as to resolve to be mad, because
others are, and have been so. God hath furnish'd us
with Faculties and Powers, to discern the Dross from the
Silver, and the Tin from the purer Mettal, and we have
his Word, to guide us in distinguishing the <hi>use,</hi> from the
<hi>abuse;</hi> and as the temperate Man still drinks Wine,
though thousands in the World still pervert the use of
that Creature; so a good Christian can see no rational
discouragement from coming to this Table, though some
have made it their bane, and turned it into their own
destruction.</p>

               <head>The CONTENTS.</head>
               <p>It is a thing not absolutely necessary, to receive the Lord's
Supper fasting; Several Reasons to prove the Assertion.
Yet, to receive it Fasting, is a thing very conventent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it quickens Devotion, and is an Act agreeable to the
mortifying Prospect of Christ's Death, and warranted by
the Practice of the Universal Church. Total Abstinence
from Food, that Morning we receive, may be prejudicial
to some Constitutions, which must therefore be indulged to
eat something at Home. Cautions and Rules to be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in Eating before we Receive. The Decay of Fasting
among Christians of this Age, an Argument of the Decay
of Christianity. To Fasting, before we Receive, must be
joined afterward Abstinence from Sin. The Prayer.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>I. THat it is not absolutely necessary to eat the Lord's
Supper Fasting, will appear from the following
Arguments.</p>
            <p>1. Neither Eating, nor Abstinence do in themselves
commend us unto God, <hi>for neither if we Eat, are we the
worse, neither if we Eat not, are we the worse,</hi> saith
St. <hi>Paul, 1 Cor. 8. 8.</hi> It's not the Belly God regards so
much as the Heart, and the Frame of the Soul he ever
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:103387:36"/>
respects more than the Bowels; The <hi>Pharisee,</hi> that lays
the stress of his Religion upon an empty Stomach, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes
the Nature of God as much as the <hi>Pythagorean,</hi>
who fancies God will be pleased with his chusing one
sort of Food before another; Neither the former's ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staining
from <hi>Swines-Flesh,</hi> nor the other's Aversion from
<hi>Beans,</hi> is an Offering acceptable to him, especially where
they stand single, and have no other Virtues to bear
them company. God being a Spirit, loves to converse
with Spiritual Natures, and such are our Souls; and an
humble and broken Spirit prevails more with him than
all outward Ceremonies whatsoever. The Jews, <hi>Es. 58.
3.</hi> were as much out, when they cryed, <hi>Wherefore have
we fasted, and thou seest not?</hi> as those, <hi>Luk. 13. 26.</hi> that
said to Christ, <hi>Have not we eaten and drunk in thy presence?</hi>
One Act of sincere Contrition, is a more pleasing Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle
to God, than a thousand external Formalities;
and doing his Will, a more acceptable Sacrifice than a
rueful Face, Fasting hath no intrinsick Virtue, the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Aspect God vouchsafes it, is upon the account
of something within, that looks very lovely in his Eyes,
and that is a Conscience sprinkled from dead Works.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Christ's</hi> Example is a convincing Argument, that
to receive it Fasting is not absolutely necessary. Not
only St. <hi>Matthew, Matth. 26. 26.</hi> but the other Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists
assure us, that while Christ and his Disciples were
eating the Passover, or as soon as they had eaten it, he
took Bread, and Blessed it, and brake, and gave it to
his Disciples, and said, take, eat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Had it been a sin
to do so, we may rationally suppose, the first Author of
this Sacrament would have given no encouragement to
it by his Example; and though it's true, <hi>that</hi> may be
sometimes lawful in a <hi>Prince,</hi> which may be an Error in
the <hi>Subject;</hi> yet our <hi>Great Master</hi> laid aside that Piece
of State, and appeared in the Form of a Servant, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
obedient to that Law, he would have his Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
live up to; He did not prescribe one thing, and do
another, but like a watchful General, put his Hand to
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:103387:37"/>
that Plough, at which he would have others labour; and
it's evident enough, that while he and the Disciples were
eating, or as soon as they had eated the Passover (and
consequently they were not fasting) he bid them Eat and
Drink of the Sacramental Bread and Wine, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
they did, and we may be confident he would
not have led them into an Error.</p>
            <p>3. The Apostles afterward we see, were indifferent,
whether they gave it to Men fasting, or to Persons, who
had been at a Meal just before, so they were but studious,
of a pure and spotless Conversation, and so much ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
from what we read, <hi>Act. 2. 46.</hi> After they came
from the Temple, <hi>i.e.</hi> after they came from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Prayer in the Temple, which was at <hi>Nine</hi> of the
Clock in the Morning, and at <hi>Three</hi> in the Afternoon
they break Bread from House to House, and giving it
in the <hi>Afternoon,</hi> as well as in the <hi>Morning,</hi> we may just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
conclude they laid no stress upon Peoples receiving it
fasting. However, it's plain that the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
by St. <hi>Pauls Allowance</hi> and Approbation, administred
and received it after their <hi>Love-Feasts;</hi> and while they
observed the Rules of Decency, Sobriety, and Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
and Charity, and Seriousness in those <hi>Agapae,</hi> or
Feasts of Charity, the <hi>Apostle</hi> found no fault with their
Communicating after them; but when they became
luxurious, and grew exorbitant, and made provision for
the Flesh more than the Spirit, he justly changed his
Discourse, and turned his former Gentleness into sharp
Reproofs, and Apostolical Reprehensions; and he had
reason, for these Doings would have soon brought this
weighty Ordinance into Contempt, and made Men ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor
the Offerings of the Lord.</p>
            <p>II. Notwithstanding all this, to receive it Fasting, is
a thing very convenient.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Because it quickens Devotion.</hi> That we are not to
come to the Table of our Lord with an indifferency of
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:103387:37"/>
Mind, or looseness of Fancy, or carelesness of Affections,
none can be ignorant: The sublimest Mystery requires
the sublimest Thoughts, and a Mind as clear from gross
and carnal Apprehensions, as Mortality will let us; but
this is not to be done without Fasting, Meat and Drink
filling the Brain with Fumes, and as you have seen a
Cloud coming before the Sun, intercepting, and darken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the brighter Rays of that noble Planet; so the greasie
Steams and Vapours, which feeding before, sends up to
the nobler Parts, must needs, in some measure at least,
obscure the Understanding, the Sun in this <hi>Microcosm,</hi>
and hinder it from spreading and dispersing its kindly
Beams and Influences; and this was the Opinion, not
only of the Primitive Believers, but of the <hi>Pythagoreans</hi>
also, and other Philosophers, whose Great Maxim was,
That the <hi>purest Thoughts</hi> flow from an <hi>empty Stom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ch,</hi> or
Self-denial in Meat and Drink. That the ancient Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
fasted so often, the reason certainly was, to give
Wings to their Devotion, and to make their Prayers fly
the faster, and with greater Alacrity to Heaven. This
way they found was most proper to plant a Spiritual
Temper in their Souls, and when they would mount up
with greater Chearfulness above the Clouds, they gave
themselves to Fasting and Prayer. And indeed, in
some Constitutions at least, the Soul never acts more
like it self, than when the Body gives it no Divertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
by Eating and Drinking for a time. The more
the Body is fed, the leaner grows the Soul, and the
leaner the Body is kept, the fatter grows the Soul; all which
is evidence enough, That to receive the Holy Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
Fasting, is the way to receive it with the quickest,
and therefore most sutable Devotion.</p>
            <p>2. To receive it fasting, is an <hi>Act most agreeable to
the mortifying Prospect of Christ's Death and Passion.</hi> What?
Look upon so dismal an Object with a full Stomach, or
a pampered Body, which is enough to tempt us to say
with St. <hi>Thomas</hi> in another case, <hi>Let us go, that we may
dye with him, John 11. 16.</hi> He that comes to this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
comes to dye with Christ, <hi>i. e.</hi> to dye to Sin,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:103387:38"/>
and sure no sober Man will think Eating and Drinking
to be a proper Preparative for so serious a Death: How
absurd is it not to have all things suitable in a great So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity?
In the Communion we come to behold a
Fasting Saviour, fasting and abstaining, not only from
Common Food that Day he suffered, but fasting from
a Sense of the charming Love of God, and from the
Comforts and Communications of the Divine Nature,
which by a Miracle withdrew its Shine and Splendor,
and left him in the Dark; a severer Fast, than if those
Three and Thirty Years he lived in the World, he had
eaten nothing, and can we behold this dreadful Fast, and
not appear fasting before the Altar? Besides, do People
make a Meal when they are going to a Feast? A greater
Banquet we cannot go to, than that which the King of
Heaven hath prepared; and shall we fill our Bellies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we appear here, and dull our Appetite to the richer
Food?</p>
            <p>3. To receive the Lord's Supper Fasting, hath been the
<hi>Practice of the Christian Church</hi> for many hundred Years;
for when sad Experience taught the Fathers how unfit
the preceding Love-Feasts made the Generality for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
<hi>Christ</hi> in this Ordinance, they thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
obliged, not only to separate those Love-Feasts
from the Supper of the Lord, but to make strict Orders
for the Celebrating of it in the Morning, and to charge
all Persons to receive it with an empty Stomach; while
the heat of Persecution lasted, they were forced to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it very early before Day, that they might not meet
with Affronts or Disturbances from the Heathens, if
if they had known of the time of their Meetings; but
what Persecution made necessary at first, was made
so afterwards by a Law; I mean by a <hi>Law Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical,</hi>
and therefore the Third Council of <hi>Carthage</hi>
decrees expresly, That <hi>the Sacrament of the Altar should
be taken and received by none, but such as are Fasting:</hi> A
thing so religiously observed, especially by the <hi>Eastern
Churches,</hi> that when some of St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi>'s Enemies had
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:103387:38"/>
informed against him, that he had given the Holy
Communion to Persons, who he knew had eaten at
Home, before they came to Church; he falls a protest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and wishing, If he had done such a thing, that his
Name may be blotted out of the Catalogue of Bishops;
nay, That Christ may exclude him from his Everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Kingdom. In St. <hi>Austin</hi>'s time, it was become an
universal practice to take and receive it Fasting: And
though in <hi>Egypt</hi> not a few kept to the old Custom of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
it after their common Suppers; yet the Disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
lrreverence, and Intemperance they fell into by
that means, hath been defensative sufficient to wise Men
from following them in that preposterous way of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving;
so that we may truly say, that this Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating
with an empty Stomach, hath been the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of most Christian Churches ever since the Apostles
days; and this was part of their Rules and Canons;
and what hath been so punctually observed by most
Churches of the World, ought certainly to weigh much
with him that believes the Church to be <hi>the Ground and
Pillar of Truth,</hi> as it is called, <hi>1 Tim. 3. 16.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>III. However, since it is possible, that some, by total
Abstinence from common Food that Morning they are
to receive, may make themselves unfit to receive with
due Devotion, their Stomachs not being able to bear
Emptiness, such must be allowed to eat something be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they Receive, whether they be Ministers of the
Word, who must take pains, and spend their Spirits on
such days, and sometimes are none of the strongest, or
other Persons of a weak and sickly Constitution: But
in this case, the following <hi>Rules</hi> must necessarily be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>That we eat no more than what just serves to support
Nature against Fainting:</hi> Not only the Law of Self-pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation,
but of Religion too, bids us keep our Bodies
serviceable to our Souls. If these Tabernacles of Clay
be out of order, the Soul, which, in this Valley of
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:103387:39"/>
Tears at least, works by the Organs of the Body, must
needs languish too; and the Pen, which is the Body,
being spoiled or cracked, or weakened, the Scribe,
which is the Soul, cannot write so fair as otherwise it
would do. But then there is a great difference betwixt
keeping the Body from fainting, and pampering of it.
He that before the Sacrament eats to Satiety, cannot be
supposed to bring very lively Thoughts, or a profound
Sense of the great Mystery with him to the Holy Table;
so that the quantity of Food that's taken before, must be
such as leaves the Soul in a good Posture and Temper
to be affected, and touched with the Solemnity and
Greatness of the Ordinance.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>The Food we take before, must be of the courser sort,</hi>
that the Mind may be preserved in a mortified Frame.
God, <hi>Es. 58. 3.</hi> finds fault with the Jews for allowing
themselves in Pleasures while they fasted, to shew how
unsuitable Carnal Recreations, though at other times
lawful, are on such Humiliation Days. This may just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be applied to Eating before Men come to the Holy
Sacrament: Pleasant Meat is unsuitable: To find pleasure
in Eating and Drinking before, spoils the Pleasure the
Soul should take in this Ordinance. <hi>Christ,</hi> before he
did eat of the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> did eat, 'tis true, but it was
Unleavened Bread and bitter Herbs, which I reckon
was as much as Fasting; for such Food cannot be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to be very palatable: And before the Love-Feasts,
that preceded the Sacrament, were corrupted, the
Christians did eat so moderately, that they seemed to
feed rather upon Discipline, than the Meat that was set
before them, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> words it.</p>
            <p>3. Even <hi>that small quantity of courser Food, must be taken
with pious Reflections, and Contemplations of the far nobler
Food, which, within a few Minutes after, we are like to be
partakers of.</hi> Serpents, they say, whatever injuries are
offered them, still their great care is to preserve their
heads: If it be our duty to be wise as Serpents, it must
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:103387:39"/>
be our care too to guard our Heads, our Minds I
mean, especially where necessity forces us to eat, before
we come to the Lord's Table, that the serious frame be
not overthrown, and that it may appear, it is not delight
in eating, but desire to be the better able to converse
with God, which makes us give our Bodies such neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
Refreshments as their weakness requires. And if you
ask me, What Reflections are most proper in this case?
I need only send you to that Guest, <hi>Luc. 14. 15.</hi> who
sitting at the Table, said, <hi>Blessed is he that shall eat Bread
in the Kingdom of God!</hi> So he that upon such occasions
gives his Body ordinary Food, may reflect on the Table
in Christ's everlasting Kingdom, where God's Glory
will be the Meat, and the light of his Favour the Drink,
and Angels the Musicians, and glorified Saints the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
and the Eternal Love of God the Canopy, under
which the vast Armies of Martyrs and Saints will feast,
and gather everlasting strength; strength which no
sickness, no illness, and no accidents can ever weaken
or dissolve.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The Preceding Considerations reduced to Practice.</head>
               <p>I. WE may take notice here of the strange decay
of Christianity, especially with respect to
Fasting; a piece of Devotion, whereby the Primitive
Believers effected very great things: And it's to be feared
that the over-tenderness of Men to their Bodies in this
Age, and a <hi>fancy</hi> that every thing is necessary which their
Appetite craves, is no small hinderance to their eminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
in Virtue and Goodness. It's granted, that Men may
be very vicious, and yet great Fasters too, as one <hi>John
Scot</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> in the year 1539. a man
of no Learning,<note place="margin">See Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop <hi>Spots<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi>'s Hist. Book 2. p. 69.</note> and no good Qualities nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
who was able to abstain thirty or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
days together from all manner of Meat
and Drink; whereof the King willing to
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:103387:40"/>
make tryal, shut him up in a Room within the Castle of
<hi>Edinburgh,</hi> suffering no creature to come at him: A little
Bread and Water indeed was set before him at his first com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into the room; but upon examination, it was found that
he had not so much as tasted of it in the space of 32
days. And going afterwards to <hi>Rome,</hi> the like proof of
his fasting was given to Pope <hi>Clement</hi> VII. and some time
after, preaching against King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth's Divorce
at <hi>London,</hi> he was shut up in Prison, where he fasted 50
days, yet continued still a dissolute man. But it is not
the bare abstinence that makes a Man a Christian, but
the spending a Fast religiously, and to good ends, works
the Miracle of Holiness; and such were the Fasts of the
Primitive Believers, who by such frequent Mortifications
made their Graces tower and climb, and culminate, to
the admiration of the unbelieving World; when they
would conquer any Corruption, when they had a mind
to arrive to any excellency in Vertue, when they wanted
a signal spiritual Blessing; nay, when their Friends and
Relations, or any eminent Servant of God, lay sick, they
presently applied themselves to this piece of Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and found great success: And it stands to reason,
that where the Soul gets thus above the Body, slights the
Pleasures of the flesh, determines to converse with God,
and entertains herself with the thoughts of his Greatness
and her own Vileness; God, who ever loves an humble
Spirit, will look down and satisfie the longing Soul, and
fill the thirsty Soul with Goodness. Yet,</p>
               <p>II. Let's not think we have discharged our duty, when
we have received the Lord's Supper fasting; that will
signifie but little, if after receiving we do not fast from
sin. This is the acceptable <hi>Lent,</hi> and must be observed
more religiously than the <hi>Mahometan</hi> doth his month
<hi>Ramasan:</hi> This is the Fast which the Lord hath chosen,
and except our Abstinence from Food be in order to
this Fast, God regards it no more than the lowing of
Oxen, or the bleating of Sheep. To fast from sin, is
both a Preparative for the Lord's Supper, and must be
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:103387:40"/>
the consequence of it. This Fast must be the very end
of our coming to the holy Table, and we eat and drink
there, that we may be out of love with this dangerous
Meat. Nor is this Fast from sin a thing impossible, if by
sin, as we ought to do, we understand wilful and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual
sin; and the Motives to this perpetual Fast are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
cogent: He that believes that sin is the Food of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils,
and the Meat of Hell, and the Festival of Fallen
Angels, can have no great Stomach to it. Nothing starves
the Soul sooner than sin; and as pleasant as it may be to
the Palate, the Soul suffers extreamly by it, and falls into
<hi>Palsies</hi> and <hi>Apoplexies.</hi> It makes it not only lean, but
miserable too; it shuts her out from the care and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness
of a Gracious God, and, in its pernicious effects,
goes beyond the Apples of <hi>Sodom;</hi> for whereas these, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
touching of them, fall and shatter only into Ashes,
that ends in eternal Fire. The Ears must be stopt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
against its Charms, the Eyes shut against its alluring
Dresses; and thus we may wean our selves from any af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
to this forbidden fruit.</p>

               <p>The Bread, Christ made use of, was, in all probability, unlea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened
Bread. The reason why, in the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
we make use of Bread that's leaven'd. Wheaten
Bread made use of in the first Institution. Substantial Bread
necessary in the Celebration of this Sacrament, not Wafers.
Several Reasons why Christ made use of Bread in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution.
God makes use of very mean and ordinary things,
to represent great Mysteries by them. Examination neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary,
whether we are strengthned by the Holy Bread in
this Sacrament. Several signs and characters of spiritual
strength, laid down. The Prayer.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>I. THat Christ made use of Bread in this Sacrament,
we have the concurrent Testimonies of the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists;
and considering the circumstances, he then was
under, cannot but conclude, that it was Unleavened
Bread he used, because at that time, when he instituted
this Sacrament, no other Bread was to be had, it being
the <hi>First day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread,</hi> as we are
informed by <hi>St. Matthew,</hi> Chap. 26. 17. <hi>Now the first
day of Unleavened Bread, the Disciples came to Jesus, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
unto him, where wilt thou, that we prepare for thee to
e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t the Passover?</hi> If Christ did eat the Passover of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leavened
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:103387:42"/>
Bread, and instituted the Sacrament of the
Eucharist after he had eaten the Passover, it must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
follow, that he used Unleavened Bread in this
Institution; for, from the first day of Unleavened Bread
to the last, no Leaven was suffered to remain in any
Jewish House whatsoever: For <hi>Seven days shall ye eat
Unleavened Bread, even the first day ye shall put Leaven out
of your Houses; for whosoever eats Leavened Bread from the
first day, until the seventh day, that Soul shall be cut off
from Israel, saith</hi> the Law. 12. 15. And therefore Christ,
who came not to destroy the Law, but to fulfil it, must
be supposed, to have done according to this Law, and
consequently, instituting this Sacrament immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Passover, he could not possibly make use of any
other Bread, but Unleavened, because there was no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to be found in the Houses of the Israelites at that
time. And whereas it is said by some, that Christ did
eat the Passover, before the Jews, and consequently
there migh be Leavened Bread to be had; I answer,
That he did indeed eat it before the Jews, but still the
same day that the Jews did eat it, Christ in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the Fourteenth Day of <hi>Nisan,</hi> the Jews about
the latter end of it; and if so, no Leaven could be had;
for, from the Fourteenth to the One and Twentieth,
Religion exterminated and banished Leaven from all
Mens Habitations. But here will arise a Question, If
Christ made use of Unleavened Bread, <hi>Why doth the
Church of</hi> England <hi>use Bread with Leaven in it, in the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Sacrament?</hi> But the reason of this is,</p>
            <p>1. Because the Primitive Church, and the Christians
that succeeded the <hi>Apostles,</hi> and who could not but know
the sense of the <hi>Apostles</hi> in this point, looked upon it as a
thing indifferent, whether Leavened or Unleavened
Bread were used in the Sacrament; and therefore, in
times of Persecution especially, they made use of such
Bread as they could get, never disputing whether it had
Leaven or no Leaven in it. Indeed, about the Year
1053, there arose a great Controversie betwixt the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:103387:42"/>
               <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Churches, whether Leavened or Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leavened
Bread ought to be used in the <hi>Eucharist;</hi> The
<hi>Greeks</hi> standing up for the Necessity of using Leavened,
The <hi>Latins</hi> for using Unleavened Bread; And the <hi>Greeks</hi>
proceeded to that Heat in the Dispute, that they asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
That Unleavened Bread was no Bread at all: But
in this they were so palpably mistaken, that a Child,
which had read the Bible, might discover their wilful
Error, the Scripture calling both the
Leavened and Unleavened Compositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Meal and Water,<note place="margin">Vid. Vers. LXX. l. c. <gap reason="foreign">

of <hi>Bread, Exod. 29. 2.</hi> and <hi>Judg. 6. 20.</hi>
What <hi>Michael</hi> the <hi>Patriarch</hi> of <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople</hi>

               </gap> 
               <hi>Bread</hi> is
derived from a Word, importing <hi>eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>

               <note place="margin">

                  </gap>.</note> and therefore must be
such Bread which hath received Eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Warmth from Salt and Leaven, is a Fancy and
Quibble, rather than an Argument: But this hath been
the Custom of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> ever since they became Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
to the Primitive Simplicity of the Gospel, to stand
up for little and inconsiderable Problems of Divinity, as
if they were Articles of Faith, and to defend a Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
or Circumstance, as hotly as if the whole Frame
of Salvation depended upon it.</p>
            <p>2. We make use of Leavened Bread in the <hi>Church</hi> of
<hi>England,</hi> because the Substance or Essence of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is not at all prejudiced by it; and in things mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
circumstantial, the Church hath not only varied from
the first Customs, but may lawfully vary, as she sees
occasion, as will appear more fully from what we shall
hereafter lay down concerning Ceremonies. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
why <hi>Christ</hi> made use of Unleavened Bread, was
because there was no other to be had at that time; that
which he chiefly intended, was Bread, which Feeds and
Nourishes the Body, thereby to represent the spiritual
Nourishment of the Soul, the greater thing intended in
this Sacrament; and since Leavened Bread will do this,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:103387:43"/>
as well as Unleavened, we need not be very scrupulous
about it; though if the Church thought fit to alter the
Custom, and use Unleavened Bread, I should be ready
to subscribe to it, for no other reason, but because it best
represents the Temper a Christian ought to have at all
times<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but more particularly at his approaching to the
Lord's Table, <hi>viz.</hi> Sincerity, and Godly Simplicity, to
which the <hi>Apostle</hi> alludes, <hi>1 Cor. 5. 8. Therefore let us keep
the Feast, not with the old Leaven, neither with the Leaven
of Malice and Wickedness, but with the Unleavened Bread
of Sincerity and Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>II. As it was <hi>Unleavened Bread</hi> Christ made use of in
this Sacrament, so it was <hi>Bread made of Corn, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
of that sort, which Bread is usually made of among us,</hi>
and that's <hi>Wheat;</hi> for though the Jews, especially the
poorer sort, used Barly Cakes, and Barly Bread some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times;
and our Saviour himself took the five Barly
Loaves and distributed them to the Disciples, and the
Disciples to the Multitude, <hi>Joh. 6. 9.</hi> Yet in the Passover,
wherein they remembred the greatest Deliverance that
ever happened to the Jewish Nation, it's probable, they
made their Unleavened Cakes of the best Corn, <hi>i. e.
Wheat,</hi> the rather, because in their Meat Offerings and
Cakes which they offer'd to God, they were command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to use the finest Wheat Flour, <hi>Levit. 2. 12. 45.</hi> and
as their Deliverance from <hi>Egypt</hi> gave them a Title to
that Land, one great blessing whereof was, their being
<hi>filled with the finest of the Wheat, Psal. 147. 14</hi> so its like,
they would not in their Passover, in the Bread they
used, omit the commemoration of that Mercy; and the
same Bread which Christ made use of in the Passover,
we must suppose, he made use of in the institution of
this Sacrament; This will give us occasion to enquire,
<hi>whether any other thing Men make use of, instead of Corn-Bread,
may be used in this Holy Sacrament;</hi> for it's certain
that in some Countries they have no Corn, and divers
Authors tells us, how much the Bread differs in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
parts of the habitable World, according to the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:103387:43"/>
nature of the Soil, and temper of the Inhabitants; The
<hi>Egyptians</hi> heretofore made Bread of Millet, and Milk,
and Water, and in some part of the <hi>West-Indies</hi> at this
day, they make Bread of the roots of certain Trees,
which they dry, and powder, and then make up into
Paste, or Bread, and so they do in divers parts of <hi>Africa;</hi>
And as it may be the lots of many <hi>Christians</hi> to be cast
upon such places, so the question may justly be ask'd,
<hi>Whether in the administration of the Lord's Supper, being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute
of Bread made of Corn, they may, with a safe Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
make use of any other;</hi> And most Divines answer
in the affirmative: For tho' the <hi>Canonists,</hi> among the
<hi>Papists,</hi> will allow nothing to be Bread, but what is
made of Corn, yet whatever it is, that nourishes like
Bread made of Corn, is Bread to them, who are so
nourish'd by it: And since the reason of <hi>Christ</hi>'s making
use of Bread in this Sacrament, was to represent the
Spiritual nourishment of our Souls, by application of
the benefits of his death, or as we commonly speak, by
his Body and Blood; Why should not any Nation, or
People make use of that in the Sacrament, to represent
this Spiritual nourishment, which serves them instead of
Bread, and gives the same nourishment to their Bodies
that ordinary Bread doth? especially where Bread of
Wheat, or Rye, or Barley is not to be had: Yet this is
not to be applied to other Fruits of the Earth, such as
Pears, and Apples, and Figs, and Melons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as if
they, in case of necessity, might be made use of instead
of Bread; for though they nourish too, yet no Nation
makes use of them as their Bread: And since Bread is
not only used by <hi>Christ,</hi> but by all the Christian Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
in all Ages, something that hath the nature and the
name of Bread must still be used in this Holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and all care imaginable taken, that by making
use of something else, Men run not into Profanation of
this Ordinance.</p>
            <p>3. As it was unleaven'd and wheaten Bread, <hi>Christ</hi>
made use of in the Institution of this Holy Sacrament;
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:103387:44"/>
so it was also <hi>substantial Bread,</hi> not a <hi>Wafer,</hi> as is now
used in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> That Christ used substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Bread, no Man ever doubted, that understood, what
Bread the Jews made use of in the Celebration of the
Passover, and for a thousand years after Christ, the
Church was wholly ignorant of <hi>Wafers.</hi> It's granted,
that the Sacramental Bread was antiently called <hi>Host,</hi>
from the <hi>Latin, Hostia,</hi> a Sacrifice, because the Bread
represents the Body of Christ, which was offered in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
for the sins of the World; (which name of <hi>Host</hi>
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> still applies at this day, to their
Wafers in the <hi>Mass)</hi> but then it was substantial Bread,
or a <hi>whole Loaf,</hi> they called by that name. How these
Wafers first came in, is explain'd by
<hi>Honorius Augustodunensis.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vid. Voss Disp. 19. de Sacris Coen. Dom. Symb.</note> 
               <hi>The report goes,</hi>
saith he, <hi>that it was usual in former times
for the Ministers of the Church, when the
Sacrament of the Altar was to be Celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
to fetch a quantity of Meal, or Flower from every House
or Family, in the place they lived in, which Custom is yet ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
among the</hi> Greeks, <hi>and of that to make the Bread,
which was to be used at the Lord's Table, and distributed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Communicants: But after the Church increased in
number, but decreas'd in Holiness, it was order'd for the sake
of carnal Men, that those, that could, should communicate ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
every Lords Day, or every Third Lord's Day, or on the
Festivals of the Year. But the People not coming, and there
being no need of so great a Loaf, as formerly, it was thought
good, to use Wafers in the form of a larger Penny; and that
they might not want a Mystery for these new doings, the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
desired, instead of Flower, to offer every Man a Penny;
that thereby they might acknowledge, how their Lord and
Master was betraid for Thirty pieces of Silver.</hi> So far he;
And it's probable, that from hence came the <hi>Easter-Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi>
which as yet are usual in most Churches of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And since these Wafers are the effects of so great
no abuse, which the wickedness of the times brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Church, it can be no great encouragement for
those that would preserve the solemnity of this Mystery,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:103387:44"/>
to keep them up, or plead in vindication of them. It's
true, the Wafers they use this day in the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> are made of Flower and Water: But,</p>
            <p>1. There is not that quantity of Flower and Water
in them, as is required in substantial Bread. Neither,</p>
            <p>2. Are they wrought, or baked, as common substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Bread is. Neither,</p>
            <p>3. When they are made, are they design'd for any
thing but to seal Letters withal: I mean in the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
use of them, before the Priest doth lay them upon
the Altar, which shews that they are not intended for
nourishing Bread, nor have they the right taste, or smell,
or strength of Bread, neither are they commonly sold
for Bread, nor doth any Man make use of them for his
daily Bread, thereby to strengthen his Body: So that
they do not answer Chrst's design, and the <hi>Analogy</hi> that
ought to be betwixt the thing signifying, and that which
is signified: <hi>i. e.</hi> They, being no substantial Bread, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
exactly represent the substantial Nourishment of the
Soul, and therefore have been most justly rejected by
most Churches, but by that which hath made bold with
God himself, with Scripture, and the express Laws of
our Saviour, and substituted their own Inventions, and
Traditions.</p>
            <p>IV. Why Christ made use of Bread in this Holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
is next to be consider'd. Besides the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Reason I have already mentioned, <hi>viz.</hi> To repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
the Nourishment he intends our Souls by his Death
and Crucifixion, if we lay hold of it by an active and
fruitful Faith, there may these following Reasons be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
given for it.</p>
            <p>1. To put us in mind that he was the Person prefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured
by the Bread, variously prepared, and ordered
under the Law, and in the Temple, and in the Rituals
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:103387:45"/>
of the Jews. The <hi>Shew-bread</hi> was to be before the Lord
continually,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </note> 
               <hi>Exod. 25. 30.</hi> In the Original
it's called, <hi>The Bread of Faces.</hi> The My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
of it was to shew, that Christ was to be the great
Mediator, who should be always in the Presence of
God, behold his Face, and live for ever to intercede
for us; and though other significations may be ascribed
to that Rite, yet Christ being the end of the Law, we
must refer all principally to him; and as the Bread in
their Offerings and sacred Ceremonies was variously or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
so it had various significations, as the Fathers
have observed. Bread, or Corn, while it was yet in
the Ear, represented <hi>Christ</hi> vailed, and seen darkly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Law: Bread, or Corn rather in its Flower,
<hi>Christ,</hi> as he was preached by the Prophets: Bread
formed and perfected, <hi>Christ,</hi> as he was clad in Flesh:
Bread baken in an Oven, <hi>Christ</hi> being in the Virgin's
Womb: Bread fry'd in the Pan, <hi>Christ</hi> in his Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and Agonies: Bread toasted, <hi>Christ</hi> being Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.
I will not warrant all these Applications from
Scripture; however being pious, and according to the
Analogy of Faith, they ought not to be superciliously
rejected.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Bread is the Sign of Friendship.</hi> It was so not only
among the <hi>Jews,</hi> but the ancient <hi>Pythagoreans</hi> too, whose
Symbol it was, <hi>Take heed of breaking the Loaf, i. e.</hi> Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship;
and that which makes it an Emblem of Amity
and Love, is, because many Corns go together to make
one Loaf, and the several parts are closely compacted,
do perfectly agree, and are united, and incorporated
one with the other: <hi>Christ</hi> therefore made use of Bread,
not only to tell us, that by eating of this Bread, we are
made the <hi>Friends</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> and <hi>Christ</hi> is made our
Friend, if we eat as becomes the Gospel of <hi>Christ;</hi> but
to hint to us, how we, that call our selves <hi>Christians,</hi>
should love one another, how dear we ought to be one
to another, and how, like Members of the Mystical
Body of <hi>Christ,</hi> we ought to be affected with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Misery; as in the Natural Body, if one Member
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:103387:45"/>
be afflicted, all the rest sympathize with it; and if one
suffers, all feel the Smart and Anguish.</p>
            <p>3. This was to <hi>excite our Hunger after Christ,</hi> as the
sight of Bread raises the Appetite of an hungry Man. If
Christ be <hi>the Bread which came down from Heaven,</hi> as he
saith himself, <hi>John 6. 51.</hi> he must needs be the best, the
sweetest, the purest, the cleanest, the wholsomest, the
savouriest, and the most nourishing Bread, and to a
Soul sensible of her own Vileness or Danger, the most
delicious Object; such Souls he frequently calls, as
knowing, that their Inclinations, Desires and Breathings
to be satisfied with his Favour, must needs be vigorous
and impatient of Repulses. For what makes the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
long after Gold, or the Seaman in a Storm after
his desired Haven, the one can satisfie the greedy Man's
Necessities, the other free the Mariner from Fears and
Dangers; Christ alone can satisfie the Necessities of a
wounded Soul, and he is the only Port, in which a Soul,
that's weary of Sin, can find Rest and Ease, and Safety
from Danger. Where Men look upon these earnest
Desires as Excesses of Devotion, or Effects of a Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered
Brain, 'tis a sign they were never sensible of the
Terror of Sin, nor did the Roaring Lyon ever fright
their Souls by Suggestions of Despair, nor did they ever
see themselves undone and miserable, else their Hearts,
and their Flesh would cry out for the living God; Ask
a Man that's sinking in the Sea, what makes him cry for
a Deliverer: Ask him that's fallen among Thieves, what
makes him long after some good Christian to rescue
him. Did Men feel the Load of Sin, and were their
Souls sensible of what they say in the Communion Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
that the Burthen is intolerable, they would need
no Prompter to Cry with <hi>David, O God, thou art my God,
early will I seek thee: My Flesh longeth for thee in a dry and
thirsty Land, where no Water is,</hi> Psal. 63. 1.</p>
            <p>4. Christ used <hi>Bread</hi> here, that whenever we look
upon it, we might remember our Duty of Dealing our
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:103387:46"/>
Bread to the Hungry; By this Phrase our Kindness
and Liberality to the Poor, is expressed in Scripture, <hi>Es.
58. 7.</hi> Indeed if we reflect in this Sacrament, that we
our selves are Beggars, and expect Alms from our gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Master, we have great reason to do by the Poor
and Needy, as we would have God do by our miserable
Souls; when we come to this Table, how justly might
he say to us, as <hi>Christ</hi> to the Woman of <hi>Canaan, It's not
meet to take the Childrens Bread, and give it unto Dogs;</hi>
for how often have we with the Dog returned to the
Vomit, but he deals not with us after our Sins; He bids
us open our Mouths wide and he will fill them, not with
<hi>Quailes</hi> and <hi>Manna,</hi> but with that which outlasts both
these, and then how natural is the Inference, <hi>Hath my
God fed me, a poor Worm, this Day with the richest Bread,
and shall I let his poor Members starve? Hath he in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion
to my starved Soul, enriched it with his Love this
day, and shall not I express my Love to those who are in want
of common and ordinary Food?</hi>

               <head>The Preceding Considerations reduced to Practice.</head>

seen or frequented by Mortal Men; he ransacks not
the Sea for Rarities, nor bids his Servants kill and slay
the Fowls of the Air, or the Cattle upon a Thousand

causes to be set upon the Table, and by that expresses

done the greatest Miracles. These were not wrought

Loins; by Men that wandred about in Sheep-skins and
Goat-skins, in Caves and Dens of the Earth, of whom
the World was not worthy; by Men whom the World
looked upon as mad, and had seldom any Recourse to,
but when Necessity forced them, and they knew not
how to make shift without them. By the most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible
Things, he hath wrought the greatest Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances.
Indeed, Nothing declares his Power or Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
so much, as when he makes use of the meanest
Things, to effect those which are greatest. By Lice,
and Frogs, and Caterpillars, he destroys the Land of
<hi>Egypt;</hi> and by Three Hundred undisciplin'd Men, he
defeats the vast Army of <hi>Midianites.</hi> When he brings
the First-Begotten into the World, and bids all the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
of Heaven worship him, all this State and Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur
is performed in a Stable, in a Manger, in a Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle:
And as God, by the plainest and simplest Things,
loves to bring Things of the greatest Consequence to
pass, so he is for the plainest Devotion too. The Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risee's
Sounding a Trumpet when he gives Alms, makes
no pleasing Musick in Heaven; but the poor Widow,
that, without making a Shew, throws in her Two Mites,
even all her Living, into the Treasury, is the acceptable
Votary. Therefore grieve not, <hi>Christian,</hi> because thou
canst not bring a Thousand Rivers of Oyl, or Ten
Thousand Rams, into the Temple of God: Bring but
an humble Heart, and he will take more notice of it,
than of all the Pomp and Retinue of <hi>Bernice</hi> and
<hi>Agrippa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>II. Since the <hi>Bread</hi> in this Holy Sacrament is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present
our spiritual Nourishment, it must needs be
worth our enquiring whether we find that spiritual
Strength and Nourishment in our Souls which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
and commanded in this Ordinance. And there
can be no better Sign of our thriving upon this spiritual
Food, than if,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:103387:47"/>
1. Our Corruptions do signally abate: As in the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;
if the ill Humours begin to be qualified, and the
Sharpness of the Blood be taken off, and the Pains and
Aches decay, it is a Sign the Body advances in Health,
and Strength returns. It is so in the Soul; if our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy,
or Pride, or watchful Temper, or our Laziness in
God's Service, or our Indifferency in Devotion, or
our Backwardness to Duties, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> decays, and dwindles
away, it is a certain Sign our Souls begin to be in an
excellent Temper; for these are the Worms that hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
our Trees from growing, which if they faint and
die away, the Trees are like to come to their full
Growth and Heighth, and the Fruit of them to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Maturity.</p>
               <p>2. If our Delight in the Things of God doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease,
our Delight in the Ordinances of God, our
Delight in Meditation, our Delight in speaking and
thinking of God, our Delight in Obedience, our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in doing good, and being helpful to others; it is
as great a Sign the Soul thrives upon this spiritual Food,
as it is in the Body, when a Man begins to look with
a chearful Countenance, and the muddy Complexion
clears up, and the once sickly Person goes about his Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness
with Alacrity.</p>
               <p>3. If we loath any thing that is offensive to our
Blessed Redeemer. As an healthy Stomach doth loath
any thing that is prejudicial to the Body, so the Soul
is then in a good plight, when that which is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to the Interest of the Cross becomes odious to her;
when it goes against her to do that which must needs
be displeasing to him that died for her; when it is a
Grief to her to see the Sensualities Men wallow in,
and to hear God dishonoured, and his Name profa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
is to her as if a Sword were run into her; as it
was to <hi>David, Psal. 42. 10.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:103387:47"/>
4. If we do not content our selves with such Things
in Matters of Religion as the Vulgar are satisfied withal,
but set the Examples of the greatest Saints before us, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving
to come up to their Excellency, and Zeal, and
Love: If we do so, our very Enemies must be Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
that we thrive and grow strong upon this spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Diet, and make Preparation for Eating and
Drinking with Christ, at his Table, in his Kingdom,
<hi>Luc. 22. 29, 30.</hi>

Appetite, look'd up to the evil Tree, beheld the Fruit, that
it was fair, but without Consideration of the dangerous Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects

be like a Tree planted by the Rivers of Water, which may
bring forth Fruit in due Season; no such Fruit as once it
was, black, and shrievel'd, and wither'd; but which may
be amiable in the Eyes of God and Man: Fruit, whereby
thy Glory may be advanced; Fruit, whereby others that see
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:103387:48"/>
and know me may reap Benefit; Fruit, wherein my Soul
may rejoyce; Fruit, which may end in Peace, in Peace of
Conscience, in Everlasting Peace. Henceforward, when I
remember thee, O dearest Saviour! let me find such Vigour

lovely: Favour is deceitful, and Beauty is vain; but
to be like Thee, is Glory, and Life, and Bliss, and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
I therefore eat at thy Table, that I may be like Thee.
Oh, speak thy Blessing upon that Meat, and it will change me
into thy Image, from Glory to Glory, even by the Spirit of our
God. <hi>Amen.</hi> Come, Lord Jesu! Come quickly.</p>

               <p>Of the Word Consecration, what it imports, and what Things
were consecrated in Ancient Times. Consecration anciently

Consecration, wherein it consists. Consecration of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in this Ordinance performed sometimes only by the
Lord's Prayer. The Church of Rome deviates from that
Rule. Christ placed Consecration in Giving of Thanks.
Several Particulars, we may suppose, Christ gave Thanks

for holy Uses; and in this respect, it is the same with
<hi>Dedication;</hi> though Criticks make some difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<hi>Consecration</hi> and <hi>Dedication;</hi> meaning, that in the
former, Things profane and vulgar are set apart for an
holy Use in general; in the later, vowed and assigned
to a certain God, a thing common among the Heathens,
while they continued in Idolatry: In the Old Testament,
Consecration was used about <hi>Persons, Things, Times</hi> and
<hi>Places.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:103387:49"/>
1. <hi>Persons;</hi> Which is the Reason why <hi>Aaron</hi> and his
Sons are said to be consecrated to God, <hi>i. e.</hi> set apart and
ordained to minister in the publick Service and Worship
of God, <hi>Exod. 28. 3.</hi> And upon this Account, <hi>Moses,
Exod. 32. 29.</hi> bids the <hi>Levites</hi> consecrate themselves; <hi>i. e.</hi>
set themselves apart to revenge God's Quarrel against the
Idolaters of the Golden Calf, and to give themselves to
that peculiar and extraordinary Service, and express their
Zeal for God's Glory, beyond all other People.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Things;</hi> And these are said to be consecrated, when
they are set apart to be used in an holy Place, for reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Purposes; as the Silver and Gold, and Vessels of
Brass and Iron, the <hi>Israelites</hi> should find in <hi>Jericho,</hi> are
commanded to be consecrated to the Lord, <hi>Josh. 6. 19.</hi>
i. e. <hi>They shall be brought into the Tabernacle, or place of publick
Worship, and there used in Divine Service, and no where else.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. <hi>Times and Days;</hi> Of this sort were the Festivals of
the <hi>Jews,</hi> which were set apart for publick Meetings,
to worship God, and to perform the Duties requisite,
and the Offices of the publick Liturgy, <hi>Ezra 3. 5.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. <hi>Places;</hi> And such we find often set apart for God's
publick and private Worship, as <hi>Jacob</hi> did <hi>Bethel, Gen. 28.
18, 19, 22.</hi> And <hi>Solomon</hi> and the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated
the House of the Lord, <hi>1 King. 8. 63.</hi> i. e. <hi>They
did solemnly set that House, which</hi> Solomon <hi>had built, apart,
for celebrating the publick Worship of God in that place.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>II. Nor is the Conseration of a Thing, a bare Setting
it apart for an holy Use; but it imports also to do this
with suitable Rites and Ceremonies; particularly, with
Prayer and Praises: Which external Performance may
influence the Senses of Spectators, and cause greater Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
and Reverence. So the Temple of <hi>Solomon</hi> was
consecrated with Thanksgivings, and Supplications, and
offering Sacrifices, <hi>1 Kings 8. 22, 62, 63.</hi> And the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:103387:49"/>
Elders, <hi>Numb. 11. 17.</hi> were consecrated by Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of Hands, as Ministers are ordain'd at this day;
and <hi>Mai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>onides</hi> adds, with a solemn Song, or Hymn,
and these words, <hi>I lay my Hands upon thee, and be thou
therefore ordained to this Office, or Dignity, or Imployment.
Aaron</hi>'s Sons were in like manner consecrated, by being
anointed with Holy Oil, the Ingredients of which we
have exactly set down, <hi>Exod. 30. 30, 34, 35.</hi> And this
Way of Consecrating, we find imitated and transcribed
by the Heathen Nations, who did run out into strange
Superstitions, and extravagant Ceremonies, in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrations
of Things; as <hi>Dan. 2. 5.</hi> where <hi>Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar</hi>'s
Golden Image being to be consecrated, all Persons,
great and low, are ordered to appear at the Sound of
the Cornet, Flute, Harp, Sackbut, Psaltery, Dulcimer,
and all kinds of Musick <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And these exorbitant Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies
in Consecrations of Things are very much kept
up in the <hi>Roman Church;</hi> which seems to have transcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
<hi>Heathenism</hi> into <hi>Christianity.</hi> Indeed, Prayer and
Thanksgiving were the most ancient Concomitants of
Consecration: And these <hi>Constantine</hi> used at the Dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> having sent for this purpose to the
Fathers of the <hi>Nicene Council,</hi> to assist at the Solemnity:
And having built a stately Church at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn'd
it with Gold, Silver and Precious Stones, the
Bishops, assembled in the Council of <hi>Tyre,</hi> were called
in, by Supplications and Psalms, to consecrate the Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
or, to set it apart for a standing Place of Publick
Devotion.</p>
            <p>III. All the Vertue that can be supposed to be in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration,
may be reduced to these three Particulars.</p>
            <p>1. The <hi>Thing consecrated puts us in mind of something
great, sublime and magnificent;</hi> such as God is, or some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
which is nearly related to him: And so much we
may guess from the Consecration of <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sons;
the History of which we have set down at large, <hi>Exod.
29.</hi> There was scarce a Ceremony used about them in
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:103387:50"/>
their Consecration, but was and may be referred to some
higher Thing. They were to be <hi>wash'd</hi> with Water,
which was to put them in mind of the Purity and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence
that was to attend their Lives and Profession.
Their <hi>rich Coat</hi> they were to wear, suggested to them
their Fruitfulness in all good Works. The <hi>Breast-plate</hi>
and <hi>Ephod</hi> that were put upon them, signified their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Knowledge and Sincerity. The <hi>curious Girdle</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
them, was an Emblem of that Truth and Veracity
they were to study. The <hi>Bonnets</hi> upon their Heads re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
the Graces of God's Spirit they were to be
adorn'd with. The <hi>Mitre</hi> and the <hi>Crown</hi> upon <hi>Aaron</hi>'s
Head, prefigured the Royal Priesthood of the Son of
God, which was to appear in the World. The <hi>Anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Oyl</hi> that was to be poured out upon him and his Sons,
told them that they must be Spiritual Men, and mind
the Things of the Spirit; and that in their Consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
they <hi>were to lay their Hands upon the Head of the Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock
and the Ram</hi> that were to be offered, shewed, that
though they were exalted above other Men, yet they
were sinful Men, had need of Confession, and Depreca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of God's Judgments due to them for their Sins: For
in laying their Hands upon those Beasts, they laid, as it
were, their Sins upon them, and that Death and Misery
themselves have deserved. And the same may be said of
the Elements of Bread and Wine, when they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated
in the <hi>Eucharist:</hi> The Consecration puts us in
mind of higher Things than Bread and Wine, and sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gests
to us something more noble, and more glorious,
which we are to fix our Thoughts upon.</p>
            <p>2. Consecration <hi>directs to a greater Esteem and Venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Consecrated Thing:</hi> Not an Esteem which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
to Adoration; for that would make it Idolatry;
but such an Esteem, whereby we raise our Thoughts, and
have no such mean and low Conceits about the Thing,
as before we had, when it was not yet set apart for an
holy Use, but look upon it as representative of some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more valuable: And therefore <hi>Belshazzar</hi> and his
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:103387:50"/>
Nobles incurred the Displeasure of God, because they
look'd upon the Vessels of the Sanctuary as common U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensils,
<hi>Dan. 5. 1, 2, 3.</hi> And thus it is in the Holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament:
After Consecration, the Elements require an
higher Esteem than before; they being now no more
common Bread and Wine, but representative of the
highest and most spiritual Food imaginable.</p>
            <p>3. Consecration <hi>commands a very serious Use of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated
Thing;</hi> and, at the same time, forbids all Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
Frothiness, Inattentiveness, and Careless Thoughts.
And this seems to be a Principle of all Civiliz'd Nations
in the World; who have, in all Ages, required greater
Devotion in the Temple, than in the Market-place.
And the ancient Idolaters, that worshipped their Gods in
<hi>Groves,</hi> intimated no less, since those Groves caused a
kind of Darkness; which Darkness, they thought, might
over-awe the Worshipper into greater Seriousness and
Devotion. And the same may be applied to the <hi>Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist:</hi>
The Elements being consecrated, the Consecration
ought to infuse very serious Thoughts into our Minds;
call them away from the World, and meaner Objects,
and prompt us to devout Ejaculations, to a severe At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
and to a suitable Admiration of the Bounty,
Wisdom and Goodness of God, who appears to us in
this Sacrament, with all the Charms that make Souls in
love with Holiness: And all this is but suitable to the
End of our coming to this Sacrament; which is, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrate
our selves to God, in Christ Jesus; and that is not
to be done, without a very serious Use of this Ordinance,
in which we acknowledge with the deepest Humility,
that our Souls and Bodies, and all the Gifts and Graces
we have, are the Effects of his Bounty; and declare our
unfeigned Purposes to speak, and act, and think as he
would have us, and dedicate our selves to his Service;
professing that we will use the Blessings he hath given us,
to his Glory, and the Good of his People; will resign
our selves to his Providence, and be content with the
Lot and Portion he shall think fit to assign us; and be
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:103387:51"/>
thankful for Afflictions too, as well as for Prosperity,
they being both his Gifts and Blessings; and say, and
confess, under the various Dispensations we shall meet
withal, <hi>Lord! not as I will, but as thou wilt.</hi> And who
can forget himself so much, as to think that all this may
be done without a serious Behaviour?</p>
            <p>IV. The <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> at this Day, makes strange
Work with Consecration of the Elements in the Supper
of the Lord. And though they are told
by one of their own Popes,<note place="margin">Vide Platin. in Sixt. 1. &amp; Greg. M. l, 7. Ep. 63.</note> 
               <hi>Gregory the
Great,</hi> that the Apostles consecrated on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with saying the <hi>Lord's Prayer,</hi> yet
they boldly, according to their Custom, place Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration
in the Priests muttering these Words, <hi>Hoc est
Corpus meum, hic est Sanguis meus: This is my Body, This
is my Blood,</hi> over the Bread and Wine: Which Words,
partly by their own secret Virtue, and partly by virtue
of the Priest's Office, immediately upon their being se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly
pronounced, change the Bread and Wine into the
substantial Body and Blood of Christ; whereof we shall
have Occasion to speak more largely in the Sequel. And
this is their Consecration, contrary to the Sense of the
Primitive Church, which was of Opinion that Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration
was performed by Prayer and Praises. And
though some think that Christ used a peculiar Form of
Consecration, which is either lost, or the Church did
not think necessary to preserve; yet that Fancy is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
needless, since we are told by the inspired Writers,
that Christ gave Thanks: In which he either observ'd
the usual Form used in the Passover, <hi>Blessed be God, who
hath created the Fruit of the Earth; and Blessed be God, who
hath created the Fruit of the Vine:</hi> Or, <hi>Blessed be thou, O
Lord our God, King of the World, who bringest forth Bread
out of the Earth; and Blessed be thou, O Lord our God, King
of the World, who createst tbe Fruit of the Vine:</hi> Or some
other; though it is more probable that he did not vary
from the common Practice of the <hi>Jews</hi> in this Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.
And what is this, but Consecrating the Elements,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:103387:51"/>
and Sanctifying of them? <hi>For every Creature of God is good,
and not to be refused; for it is sanctified by the Word of God,
and by Prayer,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>1 Tim. 4. 4, 5.</hi> The
<hi>Greek Church</hi> at this Day lays the Stress of Consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
upon the Prayer of the Holy Ghost, as they call
it; whereby the Holy Spirit of God is invited to come
down, and make a Change in the Bread and Wine.
In our Church we joyn Prayer and Praises, and the
Words of Institution; which is the safest Way, and
such as no rational Person can find fault with, though
the Words of Institution are sufficient in this Case, which
we discover in our Practice, when the first Consecrated
Bread and Wine are spent, and the Number of the
Communicants require a new Consecration.</p>
            <p>V. Though the Gospel tells us only in general, that
Christ gave Thanks, yet we cannot but suppose, that
they were particular Things he praised the Divine Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
for; and it is very rational to conclude, that he gave
Thanks:</p>
            <p>1. For <hi>the Providence of God,</hi> which watches over
Mankind, and brings forth Fruit out of the Earth, to
satisfie the Desire and natural Appetite of Man. God,
the Creator of all Things, provides Food and Sustenance
for all his Creatures. He causes the Grass to grow for
the Cattel: He sends the Springs into the Valleys, which
run among the Hills; they give Drink to every Beast of
the Field; the Wild Asses quench their Thirst, the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
receive their Prey from him: He it is, that hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
Toads and Snakes to be proper Meat for the
Stork, and Flies for the Nourishment of Spiders; for
some Birds of the Air he hath design'd Variety of Seeds,
and Worms of the Earth for others: He provides Leaves
for Caterpillars, and those Insects for the Use of other
Animals; and the young Ravens that make a noise, and
upon that Account are said to cry to him, are fed and
maintain'd by his Power: He prevents the Crocodile
from doing excessive Mischief, by making the <hi>Ichneumon</hi>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:103387:52"/>
his Enemy; and the lesser Fishes prove a Prey to the
greater, by his Order. In all these Things the Divine
Providence displays it self; and because the rest of the
Creatures are not endow'd with Reason to celebrate God
for his Bounty, he hath placed Man in the Earth, and
enrich'd him with an Angelical Soul, to be the Trumpet
of his Glory, and to take notice of God's feeding his
Creatures of all sorts and sizes, and particularly the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of Men; and when he sees Bread before him, the
Staff of Humane Life, to admire the Wisdom, Power
and Goodness of the Almighty. And upon this Account
it was, that Christ, as Man and Mediator, gave Thanks;
and when he took Bread, blessed the Author of it, who
had made it agreeable to Man's Nature, and gave it
Strength to nourish him; sent the Former and the Later
Rain to nourish the Seed in the Ground, and gave his
Sun-shine to warm and ripen the Corn into Perfection.</p>
            <p>2. It was not God's Providence alone that he gave
Thanks for, but <hi>for the more indearing Expressions of God's
Love to Mankind too.</hi> And this we need not wonder at,
when we read how at other Times he magnified his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
Goodness to sincere Believers; particularly, <hi>Matth.
11. 25. I thank thee, O Father, Lord of Heaven and Earth,
that thou hast hid these things from the Wise and Prudent, and
hast revealed them unto Babes.</hi> No Man ever saw the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mense
Charity and Goodness of God to the lapsed Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geny
of <hi>Adam,</hi> in those lively Characters that he did:
We can only speak of it with stammering Tongues, and
give some faint Descriptions of it; but He felt it. The
Sense of that Love over-spread his Soul, and he saw the
Heighth, and Depth, and Breadth, and Length of it:
He beheld the Miracles of this Love in all the amazing
Circumstances, and what it was for God to give a Son
to redeem a Servant, to expose a Lamb to buy a Wolf,
and to let an innocent Sheep be led to the Slaughter to
ransom Swine. He saw how that Compassion extended
it self; and what it was for the Word to be made Flesh,
and to run about to seek the lost Sheep, and when he
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:103387:52"/>
had found it, to rejoyce over it, and call his Friends, the
Angels, together, saying, <hi>Rejoyce with me, for I have found
him that was lost.</hi> He saw what it was for God to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
himself, and take upon him the Nature of Man, a
Thing infinitely below him, and to advance it above all
Heavens, above Angels, Powers, Ceraphim and Cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bim,
and place it at the Right Hand of God. He saw
what it was for Infinite Majesty to fall in love with Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery;
and for him that was adored by all the Host of
Heaven, to make himself of no Reputation, on purpose
to magnifie his Mercy in the greatest Misery. He saw
the happy Strife and Contention that was betwixt God's
Justice and Mercy: He saw how these Twins struggled
in the Womb of Eternity, and Mercy got the better,
and triumph'd over the Almighty's Rods and Axes: He
saw the Beginning, Progress, Order and Beauty of that
Love: He could measure the vast Distance betwixt Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and Earth, betwixt God and Man, betwixt the
Judge and the Malefactor, betwixt Infinite Purity and
extream Wretchedness, betwixt Righteousness and Sin,
betwixt perfect Innocence and perfect Misery. And
what a Paradox it must be to the holy Angels, to see
that Light, which lights every Man that comes into the
World, submit to the Darkness of the Grave, that some
of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Posterity might be Partakers of the Inheritance
of the Saints in Light! This he saw; and, as a Man, who
was to shew his Church an Example, he gave Thanks.</p>
            <p>VI. Christ's Actions, as they were intended for our
Instruction, so we cannot think that his Giving of Thanks
was only to express his own Devotion, as Mediator; but
that it was designed to teach us,</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Never to sit down at our common or ordinary Meals,
without praising God</hi> for the Blessings his bountiful Hand
hath vouchsafed unto us. This, it seems, is so necessary,
that the Holy Ghost reckons those Men among the
Workers of Iniquity, that sit down to Meat, and praise
not the Creator for the Provision he hath made for them,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:103387:53"/>
               <hi>Psal. 14. 4. Have the Workers of Iniquity no Knowledge,
who eat Bread, and call not upon the Lord?</hi> We render
the Words, <hi>As they eat Bread;</hi> our Translators thinking
the Expression to be a Similitude to express the Greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Persecutors, who make a Prey of God's Servants;
but the Particle <hi>As</hi> being left out in the Original, the
Words denote another Sin of those Men
that do eat Bread,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </note> and call not upon the
Lord at their Eating. 'Tis true, the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
seems to be observed by most People; and there are
few so profane, as not to say Grace at their Meals; but
it is for the most part done so slovenly, and so carelesly,
without any Sense of the Greatness of the Duty, and of
the Goodness of God, that it is made a mere Formality;
which is as bad as the total Omission of it. The Giving
of Thanks before and after Meals must be performed
with a Sense of our Unworthiness, and God's Charity:
This is to be thought and taken notice of, as much as
the Meat that is set before us; and Admiration of God's
Compassion in feeding us will add to the Relish of the
Victuals set upon the Table; and that is to eat to the
Glory of God, as the Apostle saith, <hi>1 Cor. 10. 32.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. It was also to teach us <hi>Gratitude to our Benefactors
here on Earth.</hi> Though Men are but the Instruments
whereby the Almighty's Blessings are conveyed to us,
yet there is a Gratitude due to them, and such Gratitude
as is expressed in kind Offices, and Readiness to assist
and help them when they stand in need of our Services.
But then this Gratitude must not be stretched to assisting
of them in their Sins, or complying with them in their
Viciousness and Debaucheries, or flattering them in their
sickly Passions. Man must not be pleased, to the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour
of God: And where Dust and Ashes is loved
more than he, he protests we are not worthy of him.
But to pray for them, to honour them, to study and
embrace all lawful Opportunities to express our Respect
and Esteem of them, to requite their Kindnesses with
equal Civilities, or spiritual Advice, and Counsel, and
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:103387:53"/>
Consolation, is to act like Persons prompted by Christ's
Example to be thankful.</p>
            <p>3. It was more particularly to <hi>direct us in our Praises
and Thanksgivings when we come to the Table of our dearest
Lord?</hi> Here certainly, if any where, our Hearts ought
to be fixed, and ready to sing, and give <hi>Praise;</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. For putting us <hi>in a Way of being pardon'd, and happy
for ever.</hi> We were all concern'd in <hi>Adam</hi>'s Fall, had all
forfeited our Right to God's Favour, and the Happiness
we might have expected at his Hands: God might have
lock'd up the Gate of Mercy, and made the Access to
it impossible: Having desperately turned our Backs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him, he might have let the Rebels sink deeper and
deeper, till they had come into the bottomless Gulf of
Eternal Misery; and, no doubt, all the Host of Heaven
would have applauded his Justice. And for him, who
was cloathed with Majesty and Honour, unexpectedly,
and of his own accord, to turn the Stream, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
a <hi>Saviour;</hi> and, instead of making a Way to his
Anger, shew Men a Way to his Bosom; and in the
midst of all this Confusion and Perplexity, to proclaim
the acceptable Year to the poor Prisoners: How can this
be thought of in the holy Sacrament, without Praise
and Admiration?</p>
            <p>2, For <hi>revealing this wonderful Love to us:</hi> A Favour,
Thousands of Heathens and Infidels enjoy not at this
Day; nay, are wholly ignorant of: A Love which is a
Mystery, that puzzles the Understandings of the wisest
Men. How God intends to deal with <hi>Heathens</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometant,</hi>
is hard to determine; only in general we are
told, that those <hi>who have sinned without Law, shall be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
without Law, Rom. 2. 12.</hi> Nor can we assign a just
and satisfactory Reason, why he makes not these Nations
Partakers of the glad Tidings of the Gospel; much less,
why he continues these Revelations to the Christian
World, though corrupt and debauched to a Prodigy:
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:103387:54"/>
But this we know, That if any Thing in the World de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
our Praises, this, that we have such a Treasure
communicated to us, deserves it; and more especially in
this Sacrament, where this Mystery of Reconciliation is
a most proper Object of our Meditation.</p>
            <p>3. For <hi>passing by the Apostate Spirits,</hi> and offering the
Mercy of Reconciliation to the Children of Men. The
evil Angels sinned as well as we; yet the Son of God
<hi>took not upon him the Nature of Angels, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ut took the Seed of</hi>
Abraham. 'Tis true, there was more to be said for
<hi>Adam</hi>'s Fall, than that of <hi>Lucifer:</hi> That <hi>Son of the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi>
was all Spirit, and Understanding; and <hi>Man</hi> had a
Body of Earth about him, which, though not troublesom
in <hi>Paradise,</hi> yet was the apter to receive Impressions of
Sin from external Objects. The rebellious Angels were
the first that made a Breach betwixt God and the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and Man was seduced by them; yet still these Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
as bright as they were, were Creatures; and as
Creatures, mutable; and as mutable, subject to falling;
and falling, might expect Mercy and Compassion from
an All-merciful Master; yet in the great Work of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,
no Regard is had to them, but to Man on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
and he alone, with his Race and Posterity, is put
in a Possibility of being saved and pardon'd; a Mercy
fit to be remembred in this Sacrament, but not to be
remembred without Thanksgiving and Praises.</p>
            <p>4. For the <hi>Opportunity we have of remembring Christ's
Death</hi> in the holy Sacrament: That we have Liberty to
meet in the House of God, to behold his Power and
Glory, to speak of his Love and Compassion, and to
come to his Table, and to come of often, and so freely,
without Disturbance or Molestation, without Fear of
Danger from the Tabernacles of <hi>Edom,</hi> or from the <hi>Ish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maelites,</hi>
from <hi>Moab,</hi> or the <hi>Hagarens.</hi> Though these are
Things which seem to be no great matter to an Eye that
looks on Things superficially, yet to a Person that knows
how in the <hi>Greek Church</hi> the holy Sacrament is consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:103387:54"/>
but once a Year; how in <hi>Heathenish Countries,</hi> where
Ministers of the Word are scarce, this Ordinance is used
but seldom; and how great an Hindrance to Goodness
the celebrating it but rarely is; how apt the Inward
Man, in such Cases, is to faint, and languish, and grow
sick for want of it, will think himself obliged to open
his Heart and Mouth in Praises at this holy Table, and
adore the Divine Bounty, which hath given him Will,
and Strength, and Opportunity to come to this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
Ordinance.</p>
            <p>5. For <hi>feeling our Hearts affected with the Mystery of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation,</hi>
or finding in our selves those happy Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
which make us worthy Receivers at this Table.
To feel in our Hearts a lively Faith; a Faith which,
with <hi>Moses,</hi> sees him that is invisible; a Faith that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
the World; a Faith that purifies the Heart; a
Faith that, with <hi>Abraham,</hi> moves us to sacrifice and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
that to God which is most dear to us; a Faith that
makes us patient under Reproaches and Injuries; a Faith
that is fruitful in good Works. To find in our selves an
Hope that makes not ashamed; an Hope that makes us
wait for the Kingdom of God, as the Husbandman waits
for the Fruit of the Earth; an Hope that upholds our
Hearts in Afflictions; an Hope that makes us look upon
that within the Vail, into the Sanctuary of Heaven, and
counts the Troubles of this present Life not worthy to
be compared with the Glory which ere long shall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
in us. To find in our selves an holy Charity,
which believes the best of our Neighbours, and thinks
no Evil, except there be very great Cause for it; a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
which suppresses Revenge and Malice; and not
only suppresses it for the present, but labours to destroy
it too; a Charity which moves us to Kindness and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion,
not only verbal, but actual; a Charity which
makes us tender-hearted, forgiving one another, and
forbearing one another. To find all this in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
must needs fill our Hearts with strong Desires and
Endeavours to be thankful.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:103387:55"/>
VII. This Praise and Thanksgiving cannot but be es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential
to this holy Sacrament, not a mere Ornamental
Thing, without which the blessed Effects may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
and felt. For,</p>
            <p>1. Is it possible to behold God's bleeding Love, and
not cry <hi>Praise the Lord, O Jerusalem; Praise thy God, O
Zion?</hi> Is it possible to see the surprizing Humiliation of
the Son of God, and not to say, <hi>Bless the Lord, O my Soul<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and all that is within me bless his holy Name?</hi> Is it possible
to see God offer himself for his Enemies, and not to s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ng,
<hi>Lord! what is Man, that thou so regardest him? and the
Sons and Daughters of Men, that thou hast such Respect to
them?</hi> Is it possible to see Innocence nailed to the fatal
Cross, not for any Sins of its own, but for our Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions,
and not to break forth into Admiration, with
St. <hi>John, Behold what manner of Love the Father hath shewn
to us, that we should be called the Sons of God?</hi> The Heart
must be of Stone that can survey these Wonders, and be
silent, or dumb to joyful Praises.</p>
            <p>2. What Comfort or Consolation can be supposed to
flow into the Soul without it? Praise is the Gate of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy:
The Soul that praises the Divine Love much, will
have a greater Sense of his Love, and feel the Power of
it, and feel how it melts the Heart, supples the Spirit,
softens the Inward Man, and makes it fit for the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
of the Image of the Son of God. As the <hi>Jews</hi> say
of the Spirit of Prophesse, That it rests on valiant and
chearful Men; so it may be said of the Divine Love,
Where the Soul is much and often engaged in Praises of
it, there it loves to dwell, there it is ready to build Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles,
and take up its Residence.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:103387:55"/>
               <head>The Preceeding Considerations reduced to Practice.</head>
               <p>I. EVen the meanest Capacities from hence learn the
Way to arrive to holy Thoughts, <hi>viz.</hi> by making
the most ordinary Blessings Occasions of Praise and
Thanksgiving. Nothing is more common than Bread,
yet for this the Son of Man gave Thanks; and in doing
so, bid us imitate his Practice when the like familiar
Mercies come before us, or present themselves to our
View. About the Time of the <hi>Council</hi> at <hi>Constance,</hi> two
<hi>Cardinals,</hi> as they were travelling upon the Road, not
far from the City, saw a poor Shepherd weeping; and
thinking that some sad Accident might have befallen
him, either his Dog lost, or some of his Sheep stolen,
had the Curiosity to ask him the Reason of his Tears:
who answer'd, <hi>I am looking here upon a Toad, and cannot
but weep to think what an ungrateful Beast I have been to my
God, to whom I never before in all my Life gave Thanks that
he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e did not make me so homely and so odious a Creature.</hi>
The Truth is, you and I can hardly walk the Street, but
we meet with Men either ragged, or lame, or maim'd,
or blind, or dumb, or some other way deform'd, and
extreamly miserable: Can we look on such Objects,
and not think with our selves, what a Favour and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
it was in our great and gracious God, not to plunge
us into that wretched State, but to give us Necessaries
and Conveniencies, a right Shape, and Soundness of
Limbs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> These, 'tis true, are but very ordinary Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings,
yet if we consider how many Thousands want
them, and that God, who can do all Things, and whose
Hand is to be seen in all Things, might as easily have
reduced us to such a miserable Condition as he hath done
others, and that it is nothing but his Infinite Goodness
and Wisdom that hath made this Distinction; this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but quicken our Understandings: And if so, none
of us can complain, that we have no Faculty of furnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our Minds with holy Thoughts. To this purpose,
certainly, was our Reason given us, that we might look
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:103387:56"/>
on such Mercies with spiritual Reflections and Praises;
and these Praises are holy Thoughts. Nay, the Task is
very easie; and there is nothing lies more in our power,
than, by taking a View of such Blessings, to think, <hi>This
God hath done, this is part of his Charity, this is a Character
of his Bounty: What am I, and what is my Father's House,
that God hath brought me thus far!</hi> And as it is easie, so it
is profitable too; for this will fill our Minds with humble
Thoughts, and teach us to have a low Opinion of our
selves; it being impossible to think our selves very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
of God's Favours, and not to despise our selves.</p>
               <p>II. I told you in the first Chapter of this Discourse,
that the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper among the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients
was frequently called the <hi>Eucharist:</hi> Here we see
the Reason of it; for as the Word <hi>Eucharist</hi> imports
Praise, so Thanksgiving is one of the principal Actions
and Offices in this Sacrament. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
will have it called a Sacrifice, because in the Primitive
Church it went by that Name: We deny it not, but
then they meant by it a Sacrifice of Praise; and this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
we exhort every one of you to offer, when you
remember your <hi>Great Master's Funeral: Give Thanks</hi> for
that Death, when you are preparing your selves for this
spiritual Feast; <hi>Give Thanks</hi> when you feed at this holy
Table; <hi>Give Thanks</hi> when you depart from that Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queting-house;
<hi>Give Thanks</hi> unto the Lamb that was slain,
bless him for his Wounds, bless him for his Cross, bless
him for his Bloody Sweat, bless him for all his Sighs and
Groans, bless him for his Merits, for through these your
Souls must triumph over Hell, and Sin, and Devils.
But then, take heed of praising him at Church, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronting
him at home: These Praises must be uniform,
and equal, and constant; not that you are obliged in all
Places to speak of his Glory, whatever Business you have;
or that you must do nothing but sing Psalms to him,
where-ever you are; but your upright and Christian Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour
in all Places is a Glorification of his Mercy: <hi>For
you are a chosen Generation, a Royal Priesthood, an holy Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:103387:56"/>
a peculiar People, that ye should shew forth the Praises
of him who hath called you out of Darkness, into his marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Light,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 9.</p>

            <head type="sub">Of Breaking the Bread, and the Mysteries of it.</head>
            <argument>
               <head>The CONTENTS.</head>
               <p>The Action of Breaking Bread, borowed from the Jews; used
by Christ, to put us in mind of his Crucifixion; Of the
broken State of Mankind; Of his going to break down the
Partition. Wall betwixt the Jews and Gentiles; Of the
Communion of the Body of Christ; Of our Coming to his
Table with Broken, Contrite Hearts; Of his Readiness to
comfort the Bruised and Broken Spirit; Of the Vertue and
Power of his Death, in breaking the Force of God's Wrath
against us; Of the Miracle that was to happen at his
Death in the Earth and Rocks, &amp;c. And of the strange
Divisions that would rise about this Sacrament. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of Breaking the Holy-Bread doth not interfere with
the Canon in the Rule of the Passover, that not a Bone of
the Lamb should be broken. The Church of Rome is to
blame for not Breaking the Bread. Christ, as well as the
Disciples, received the Communion. Reflections to be made
by Christians when they see the Bread broken. The Prayer.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>I. AMong the <hi>Jews,</hi> as no Man durst eat Bread with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
consecrating it by Thanksgiving, so no Man
gave Thanks for the Bread, but he broke part of it, did
eat of it, and gave of it to the rest that were with him
at the Table; and the Master of the House, if present,
was usually the Person that did all this, gave Thanks, and
dealt the Bread about: To this End the Loaves among
the <hi>Jews</hi> were made with divers Cuts or Incisions, that
when they were brought to Table, they might be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
with greater Ease by the Head of the Family, and
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:103387:57"/>
distributed to those that did eat with him. Among the
ancient <hi>Romans</hi> it was otherwise; for though they had
Cuts and Divisions upon their Loaves, yet those Cuts
were but four in all, in the Shape of a Cross, to the End
that when they came to reach it to their Guests, they
might easily break it into four Parts: Which was the
Reason why they called the Portion that fell to one Man's
Share <hi>Quadra,</hi> or the fourth Part of a Loaf. If Christ
imitated any Custom in Breaking of Bread, 'tis most
probable he followed that of the <hi>Jews;</hi> from whose
manner of living he used not to vary, if their Actions
and Customs had nothing of Sin in them; shewing
thereby how loath we should be, <hi>Quieta movere,</hi> to change
or alter Things in a Church or Nation, which, through
a long Succession of Time, have been received, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
there be nothing of Immodesty, Superstition, or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decency,
or Irregularity in it. The Unleaven'd Cakes
of the <hi>Jews,</hi> they use at this Day in the Celebration of
their Passover, are, in all probability, Relicks of that
ancient Way among their Country-men of ordering
their Loaves, and making them with many Cuts and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions
in them, whereby the Master of the House took
occasion to break off a just and convenient Piece for each
Member of his Family. But though Christ, in breaking
the Sacramental Bread, might borrow that Right and
Action from the <hi>Jews,</hi> yet we must not suppofe, that
therefore he had no farther Design in it, but rather san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified
it into a Mystery, as he did the <hi>Washing of the Feet</hi>
received among the <hi>Jews, Joh. 13. 14, 15.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>II. As Breaking the Sacramental Bread was an Action
design'd to represent several Things of great Importance,
so the Things thereby represented may justly be suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
and piously believed, to be the following.</p>
            <p>1. An Emblem it was <hi>of that barbarous Fact</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi>
were like, in a few Minutes after, to commit against his
Sacred Person, <hi>viz.</hi> Breaking his Sacred Body by the
Torments of a painful Crucifixion: This Body of his,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:103387:58"/>
spotless as the Sun, harmonious as the Strings of a well-tuned
Lute, the miraculous Product of the Holy Ghost,
purer than Virgins Wax, big with the richest and choicest
Blood, subject to no inordinate Desire, was in a few
Hours like to be the Scorn of Soldiers, the Sport of
Scribes, and the Laughing-stock of supercilious <hi>Pharisees;</hi>
within a few Minutes, this Body was to be lash'd, buffet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
beaten, wrench'd, and stretch'd out upon the Cross:
Here his Flesh was to be torn with Nails, the Skin to be
broken, the Veins, those precious Springs, to be open'd;
and he that was fairer than the Children of Men, was
soon after to be without Form or Comeliness, a Man of
Sorrows, rejected and despised of Men, to be handled
like a Slave, treated like a Malefactor, crucified like a
Thief, and used like the worst of Mankind: Therefore
he broke the Bread, to represent this inhumane Attempt.
Such Pains did our blessed Master take with his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
to prevent their being surprized with his Passion:
He had frequently given them notice of it, armed them
against the fatal Hour, and not only in general told them
he was to suffer, but here in this Action describes the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
manner of it; and in Breaking of the Bread, hints to
them, how that noble, that curious, that excellent Frame
would be disorder'd, broken and destroyed.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>He broke the Bread,</hi> to shew that Man, for whom
he was to suffer, was in a broken, forlorn and undone
Condition, a Condition which required an Almighty Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
to put under his Shoulder, to rescue the miserable
Creature from the Thraldom of Damnation. Mankind
was indeed in a very broken State at that time, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with respect to the various Divisions that were among
the <hi>Jews,</hi> and in other Parts of the World, but with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to their Sins, Errours and Corruptions. Idolatry
had not only over-spread the habitable World, but was
come to a prodigious Heighth; many Sins, which even
the Law of Nature condemned, were become Vertues:
And to that Impiety Mankind arose, that not a few of
their Vices were consecrated into Deities; insomuch that
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:103387:58"/>
to be lewd, was Religion; and Deified Vices had their
Votaries. Among the <hi>Jews,</hi> who were <hi>Keepers</hi> of the
Oracles of God, the Great Seal of the King of Heaven;
though they went not a whoring after Idols, yet the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
that remained among them was turn'd into mere
Formality, and Outward Shew: The Moral Law, that
Eternal Standard of Truth and Goodness, was in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
trampled under Foot: The Traditions of the Elders
enervated its Force, and the false Glosses of the Pharisees
made the Divine Commands of no Effect. In a Word,
the Pillars of Religion were every where broken, the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Foundation was undermin'd, and both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi>
were intoxicated; the former with Hypocrisie, the
other with Profaneness. How desperate both their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
were, the Apostle shews at large, <hi>Rom. Chap. 1.</hi>
and 2. and more succinctly, <hi>Rom. 3. 9, 10, 11,—19.
There is none righteous, no not one; there is none that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands,
there is none that seeks after God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Christ</hi> broke
the Bread therefore, to shew how necessary it was for
him to be broken on the Cross, to redintegrate and make
whole the broken and forlorn State of Mankind; which
makes him say afterward, <hi>This is my Body, which is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
FOR YOU.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. <hi>He broke the Bread,</hi> to shew that he it was who was
to <hi>break down</hi> the Partition-Wall that separated the <hi>Jews</hi>
and <hi>Gentiles.</hi> Till the Son of God was crucified for the
Sins of the World, there was so great an Antipathy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twext
the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> that the Hatred was thought
Duty, and the Enmity, Religion; and as the <hi>Heathen</hi>
looked upon the <hi>Jews</hi> as the vilest of Mankind, so the
<hi>Jews</hi> were even with them, and looked upon them as
abominable; and to eat and drink with a <hi>Gentile,</hi> was
counted a Crime; and to make any Expressions of Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
or Favour, Impiety: To shew him the right Way in
a Journey, or to lead him to a Spring of Water in case
he were a-thirst, or to lie with him, or to contract Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
with any of them, was as detestable as to eat Swines
Flesh. And it was a Maxim in the <hi>Jewish</hi> Divinity,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:103387:59"/>
That the Holy Ghost could not rest upon an Heathen:
Which made the <hi>Jews, Act. 11. 2, 3.</hi> fall out with <hi>Peter,</hi>
because he went unto Men uncircumcised, and did eat
with them, and preach the Gospel to them. Christ, by
his Death and Resurrection, was to destroy that Enmity,
and to make <hi>the Lamb lie down with the Wolf, and the Lion
with the Calf;</hi> according to the Prophesie of <hi>Esay,</hi> Chap.
11. 6. And so it came to pass, after his Resurrection,
and the Effusion of the Holy Ghost, <hi>Peter</hi> opened the
Door of Salvation to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and the Holy Ghost
came down on the Uncircumcised, as well as on the
Seed of <hi>Abraham;</hi> and both Nations became one Flock,
one Company, and one People, under the great Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd
of the Sheep, <hi>Christ Jesus;</hi> and they who before
hated one another mortally, now fell into one another's
Embraces, and saluted one another with an holy Kiss.
Upon which Account, the Apostle says, <hi>Ephes. 2. 14,—
18. Christ is our Peace, who hath made both one, and broken
down the Middle-Wall of Partition between us, having abolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in his Flesh the Enmity, even the Law of Commandments
contained in Ordinances, for to make in himself, of twain,
one new Man; so making Peace.</hi> He broke the Bread there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
to signifie this glorious and charitable Act.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>The Bread which we break, is it not the Communion of
the Body of Christ,</hi> saith St. <hi>Paul, 1 Cor. 10. 16.</hi> And this
we may justly believe to have been our Master's Design
in this Action, for the Apostle received it of the Lord;
and what Christ had taught him, he communicated to
his Hearers: And this Breaking both shews and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
our Union and Communion. Though he broke
the Loaf into several Pieces, to give to the respective
Communicants, yet those Pieces were still Parts of that
Loaf; and this was to shew how near and dear we Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
are, and ought to be, to one another: This speaks
us Fellow members, and how tender we ought to be of
one another's Welfare, as one Member is of the Safety
of another. So that, though we are many Members, yet
we all make one Loaf, one great Body, whereof Christ
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:103387:59"/>
is the Head, <hi>1 Cor. 12. 27.</hi> And this makes all Rancor,
Malice, Envy, Hatred, Pride and Ill-Nature, absurd, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious,
abominable and intolerable among Christians, not
only at the holy Sacrament, but in their Conversation
too: For, how strange, how surprizing would it be, to
see one Piece of Bread quarrel with the other of the same
Loaf? And would to God it might be as surprizing, to
see one Christian fall out with the other.</p>
            <p>5. <hi>He broke the Bread,</hi> to hint to us, with what Hearts
we ought to come to the Table of our Lord, and to the
Altar of the Cross; even with humble, <hi>broken,</hi> contrite
Hearts. Such Hearts we might get, if it were not for
our Pride: It was therefore prohibited in the Old Law,
to use Leaven in God's Sacrifices and Offerings; Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
was the Emblem of Pride, which makes us unfit to
appear before the humble <hi>Jesus: I am broken with their
whorish Heart, which hath departed from me,</hi> saith God,
<hi>Ezech. 9. 6.</hi> This was literally fulfilled in <hi>Christ:</hi> And
shall not we share in the Depth of that Sorrow? Shall
we see him bow his Head under the Weight of our Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences,
and shall not the Burthen appear heavy and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supportable
to our Spirits? Shall we see the innocent
Lamb weep for our Stubbornness, and be unconcerned
at the Spectacle?</p>
            <p>6. <hi>He broke the Bread,</hi> to let us see how ready he is to
comfort the Contrite and Broken Heart. <hi>Christian,</hi> as
great as the Agonies were, thy Sins did put him to; as
great as the Torments were, he felt upon thy Account;
as bitter as the Death was, he suffered and tasted for
thee; yet if thy Soul relents, and if that which made
him die becomes loathsome and abominable in thy Sight,
if a deep Sense of thy Unworthiness fills the Chanels of
thy Heart, if the Fountain of thy Head runs with Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
if thine Eyes gush out in Tears, if the Weight of
thy Sins presses thy Soul into an holy Self-abhorrency, if
his Passion can fright thy Sins into a languishing Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
abate their Courage, and break their sturdy Necks,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:103387:60"/>
and his broken Body proves a Motive strong enough,
and obliges thee to break loose from the Government of
Hell; behold, those very Wounds thou madest shall be
thy Balsam; and the Blood thy Sinns did spill, shall turn
into Oyl, to supple thy broken Bones; with that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Liquor thy Soul shall be washed, and that which
was his Death, shall be thy Life and Antidote; with
that Offering of himself, once made, he will expiate thy
Filth, and perfume thy Services, render them acceptable
to God, give thee a Right to Heaven, comfort thee in
all thy Tribulations, and call to thy Soul, <hi>Be of good
chear, thy Sins are forgiven thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>7. <hi>He broke the Bread,</hi> to let us know that his Death
would break the Wrath of God, allay his Anger, pacifie
his Justice, and satisfie for the Affront his Holiness had
suffered from the Sins of Men, and make way for the
Penitent's Admission to God's Bosom. This is St. <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi>'s
Observation; and the Mystery is rational, for by
his Death he broke <hi>the Power of him who had the Power of
Death,</hi> Heb. 2. 14. This was the Devil, who got that
Power by Man's Apostacy, which provoked the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty's
Wrath, and moved him to permit the Enemy
to exercise that Power over Mankind; who was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
not only the Cause of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Death, but of all the
Deaths that followed that; for which Cause <hi>Christ</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
him <hi>a Murtherer from the Beginning,</hi> Joh. 8. 44. And
the <hi>Jews</hi> stile him <hi>the Angel of Death;</hi> and if any extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
Judgments were inflicted on Men at any time,
he was still the Executioner. Besides all this, he had
Power given him to fright Men with Death, either vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
or natural, and the dreadful Consequences of it;
of all which, Man's Apostacy was the Cause. This
Power given him by the Justice and Wrath of God, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Sins of Man, was broken by the Death of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,</hi>
who thereby gave all true Believers Power and Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
to undervalue these Fears and Terrours, to look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them as Bugbears, and Things to fright Slaves withal,
since this wonderful Death brings Life, and Pardon, and
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:103387:60"/>
Salvation to their Souls, and makes their own Death a
Passage to the full Possession of the Joys to come.</p>
            <p>8. <hi>He broke the Bread,</hi> prophetically to fore-tell what
Miracles would happen at his Death, how the Veil of
the Temple would rend, the Rocks <hi>break,</hi> and the Graves
burst their Bonds, and open; even then, when Men's
Hearts would be harder than Flints, more impenetrable
than Stones, more insensible than Adamants, less tracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
than the Earth, more rigid than the Grave, and less
relenting than inanimate Creatures.</p>
            <p>9. <hi>He broke the Bread:</hi> Why may not we think that
hereby he signified the Breaches and Divisions that,
through the Passions and various Interests of Men, would
happen in future Ages in the Church, upon the Account
of this Sacrament? What Strife, what Bitterness, what
Contentions hath this Ordinance occasion'd betwixt the
<hi>Eastern</hi> and <hi>Western Churches;</hi> and in the <hi>Western,</hi> betwixt
the <hi>Papists</hi> and <hi>Protestants;</hi> and among the <hi>Protestants,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the <hi>Lutherans</hi> and those that call themselves of the
<hi>Reformed</hi> Religion? Upon which Account, I cannot but
think of the bitter Language that both <hi>Luther</hi> and his
Followers have given to the <hi>Zwinglians</hi> and <hi>Calvinists,</hi>
that differ'd from them in Opinion about the Supper of
the Lord. Nor did the Fury stop here, but in many
Places where any of the <hi>Zwinglians</hi> were, they were
turned out, imprisoned, harrassed, expelled, driven into
Exile, and forced away to Sea in a severe Winter, in
Frost and Snow, when the Winds blew hard, and the
Weather was exceeding tempestuous; and all, because
they would not abjure these Six Propositions: 1. <hi>That
these Words,</hi> Take, eat, this is my Body; <hi>and,</hi> Take,
drink, this is my Blood, <hi>must not be understood literally, but
typically and figuratively.</hi> 2. <hi>That the Elements in the Lord's
Supper are only Signs and Symbols; and that Christ's Body is
as far removed from the Bread in the Sacrament, as Heaven
is from Earth.</hi> 3. <hi>That Christ is present in this Sacrament
by his Virtue and Power, and not with his Body; as the Sun,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:103387:61"/>
with his Light and Operation, assists and refreshes the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of God in this lower World. 4. That the Bread in the
Sacrament is the Emblem and Figure of Christ's Body, and
signifies and represents only. 5. That Christ's Body is eaten
only by Faith mounting up into Heaven, not with the Mouth.
6. That only true Believers do properly eat Christ's Body; but
wicked Men, who have no lively Faith, receive nothing but
the bare Bread and Wine.</hi> Those that would not abjure
these Doctrines, were used like Hereticks, Fanaticks and
Vagabonds: By their usage, one would have taken them
to have been guilty of Sacrilege, Murther, Robbery, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
Rebellion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but the chief Crime, it seems,
was, because having imbibed <hi>Zwinglius</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
about the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> they could not conform to the
<hi>Lutheran</hi> Persuasion in that Point. Wonderful Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty!
which one would scarce have expected from <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi>
much less from <hi>Christians,</hi> and <hi>Fellow-Protestants,</hi>
who, together with them, protested against the Corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions
of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Into such an unseemly
Behaviour do Men precipitate themselves, when they
let loose the Reins of their Passions; instead of becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Repairers of Breaches, they make them wider; and
render that Wound incurable, which, if wise, impartial
and charitable Men had the handling of, might be heal'd
up with great Facility.</p>
            <p>III. It was, indeed, a Rule in the Rubrick of the Pass<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
<hi>Exod. 12. 46.</hi> That <hi>a Bone of the Paschal Lamb should
not be broken;</hi> but that Type doth not interfere with
Christ's Breaking the Sacramental Bread: For, though
the <hi>Paschal Lamb</hi> represented the Lamb of God, which
was to die for the Sins of the World, yet that particular
Rite had relation only to that Providence in the Scene
of Christ's Passion; in which, Care was taken that his
Legs should not be broken, as those of Malefactors com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
were, as St. <hi>John</hi> expresly explains it, <hi>Joh. 19. 21.</hi>
And this shews the wonderful Exactness of Providence,
that both foretold and fulfilled that Particular in our great
Redeemer's Funeral: And though he was numbred with
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:103387:61"/>
the Transgressors, yet, in many Things, his Usage was
different from theirs, to let the World see that a special
Dispensation attended him, and that, in the midst of all
his Misery, an unknown Hand restrain'd the unruly Wills
of Men, and made them, against their Intent and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,
correspond with God's Prescience and Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
This was so minute a Circumstance, that one
would have thought it deserved no Cognisance or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction:
But, as inconsiderable as it appears to vulgar
Eyes, God knew it was of Consequence; and hereby he
taught future Ages, at once to admire the Treasures of
his Wisdom, and his Care of his only begotten Son;
who, though he condescended to die so ignominious a
Death, yet was to enjoy this Privilege above other Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactors,
that even Infidels might see he was no common
Creature. So that this Rite in the Passover must be
stretched no farther than it was at first intended; and if
so, it clashes not with Christ's Breaking the Bread for
other Designs and Purposes.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The Preceding Considerations reduced to Practice.</head>
               <p>I. SInce Christ broke the Bread, and the Act is so sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant,
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is certainly in the
wrong, who neglects this Breaking, and gives the Wafer
whole. But we need not wonder at their Neglect of this
Practice in their Rituals, who have made bold with the
one half of the Sacrament, and deprived the Laity of an
Essential Part of it, <hi>viz. The Cup;</hi> whereof we shall have
occasion to speak more largely in the Sequel. Men who
are resolved to establish their Errours, into which Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
first led them, must be bold and daring; and, since
the Word of God doth contradict them, invent and erect
an Authority equal with that of God, and set up an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
Chair, to bear the World in hand, that they can
do nothing that is unlawful; and while Oral Tradition,
that Nose of Wax, which you may turn and set which
way you list, is pretended, there is no Doctrine so absurd,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:103387:62"/>
but may be water'd from that impure Spring: And who
can question it, when the Laity are kept ignorant of the
Word of the Living God, and the Scriptures as much
forbidden as the Tree of Life was to <hi>Adam,</hi> lest he should
eat thereof, and live.</p>
               <p>II. As Christ broke the Bread, so it is justly supposed
that he did eat of it himself; for this was the Custom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the <hi>Jews,</hi> for the Master of the Family, who broke
the Bread, to eat of it himself: And though he had no
need of it, and the Mercy intended by this Sacrament
was intended altogether for the Benefit of his Disciples
and Followers, yet as he was baptized to shew a good
Example, and that he might be in all Things like unto his
Brethren, so he did eat of the Sacramental Bread, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to encourage all Christians to come and participate of
that blessed Symbol. And we may add, he did it, to
shew, that those that did eat worthily had Communion
with him, and that he would be in them, and they in
him; as those who are admitted to eat of the same Meat
the Prince himself eats of, are supposed to be his Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites.
But if Christ did eat of the consecrated Bread him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
the Doctrine of Transubstantiation, that Idol of the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> falls to the Ground: For from hence it
will follow, that Christ did eat and devour himself; which
as it is absurd, so it wants very little of being ridiculous.</p>
               <p>III. <hi>See here what Reflections thou art to make when
thou seest the holy Bread broken before thine Eyes in this
Sacrament. This thou must not look upon as an empty
Ceremony, but thy Soul must flee away to</hi> Gethsemane,
<hi>walk about</hi> Golgotha, <hi>take a Turn on the</hi> Mount of Olives,
<hi>and stand still a while on</hi> Moriah, <hi>and behold how the
innocent</hi> Isaac <hi>is bound upon the Altar, how the Son of
God hangs on the infamous Tree, a Spectacle to Angels,
and to Men: And here the Tremendous Object must
arrest thy Thoughts, and infuse such Reflections;</hi> See
here, my Sins, what Work ye have made, what Injury ye have
done: The Son of the Living God could not be quiet for you in
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:103387:62"/>
Heaven; ye pulled him down from the Mansions of Glory; ye
afflicted, persecuted, broke him here on Earth, and left him not
till ye had kill'd and murther'd him. How shall I be reveng'd
upon you? How shall I testifie my Concernedness at the Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of the Lord Jesus? How shall I convince the holy Angels
that stand about me, that I condole with him? Pride and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
of Vain-Glory, thou shalt die; Envy and Malice, thou shalt
live no longer in my Soul; Wrath and Anger, thou shalt be
dispatch'd; Hypocrisie and Covetousness, thou shalt be broke to
pieces; Intemperance and Luxury, thou shalt breath thy last:
I'll harbour no Murtherers in my Bosom, no such Traitors shall
lodge in my House. O Blessed Master! Shall I see thy Head
broke with Thorns, and not cry out, O that my Head were
Water, and mine Eyes a Fountain of Tears! Shall I see thy
Face broke with Grief, and not blush at my daring Sins that
broke it thus? Break, stubborn Heart! Break, my perverse
and ungovernable Will! Break, my head-strong Passions! O
Jesu, break these Cockatrices Eggs, and let all the Poyson
evaporate; then, then, thy Servant shall be whole.</p>
               <p>IV. Hear this, thou broken, thou contrite Penitent:
Hear this, thou distressed Soul, that art broken with a
Sense of Sin, who feelest the Burthen heavy, and bowest
under it: Behold the Rock that was broken for thee;
and of the Waters that flow from it, drink; yea, drink
abundantly: This Water is cordial, thou needest not be
afraid of Intemperance here. Hide thy self in the Holes,
in the Clests of this Rock; hither flee for Refuge: When
Devils haunt thee, when Temptations follow thee, when
Despair, like the Avenger of Blood, is at thy Heels, run
into this City of Refuge, save thy self in this <hi>Zoar;</hi> here
fear no Storm, no Waves, no Tempest; here all travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
and weary Souls find Rest; here Devils have no
Power, for they are conquered, their Dominion is taken
away, their Empire broken; here is Balm of <hi>Gilead;</hi>
here lives the Physician, whose Blood is for the healing of
the Nations; here fix, though the Earth be moved; here
shelter thy self from the Wrath to come. Christ, the
same Yesterday, to Day, and for ever, <hi>will open Rivers
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:103387:63"/>
in High Places, and Fountains in the midst of Valleys: When
the Poor and Needy seek for Water, and there is none, He,
Prince of Peace, wil hear them; He, the mighty God, will
will not forsake them; He will plant in the Wilderness the
Cedar, the Myrtle, and the Oyl-Tree; He will set in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sart
the Fir-tree, and the Pine, and the Box-tree together,
that they may see, and know, and consider, and understand to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
that the Hand of the Lord hath done this, and the
Holy One of</hi> Israel <hi>hath created it,</hi> Ezek. 41. 16, 17.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="prayer">
               <head>The PRAYER.</head>
               <p>O Blessed and Crucified Saviour! How often have I broke
with thee! How often have I broke loose from thee! How
often have I broke the Silken Strings whereby thou hast sought
to tie my Soul! How justly mightest thou turn thy Face away
from me! How justly mightest thou look upon me as unworthy
to be called any more to this Spiritual Feast! But remember,
Lord! Remember I am Dust, remember my Frailty, and do
not shut up thy Tender Mercies in Displeasure. O call after
this Prodigal, and bring him home again to his Father's House:
Make lively Impressions of thy Crucifixion upon my Mind: Let
the Torments of thy broken Body fright me from all known Sin:
Whenever I am tempted to any Thing that is evil, cry in mine
Ears, or possess me with this Thought, That that very Sin did
help to break thee on the Cross! A lively Apprehension of this
will keep my Soul undefiled; this will break and crush my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Delight in Vanity; this will embitter my Sensual Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures;
this will make me weary of running after other Gods;
this will humble my Soul; this will subdue the vain Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
whereby I have been wont to flatter my self into Misery.
O give me a View of the Riches that are to be found in thy
broken Body, that I may run no longer after broken Cisterns
and may rely no longer on broken Reeds. O let my Soul feed
on thy broken Body by Contemplation: Thou didst not count thy
Life dear for my sake, O let me be touch'd with these Thoughts,
that I may despise Death and Torments for thy sake, and may,
with all Saints and Martyrs, behold thy Face at last in Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Glory. O Jesu! Great Store-house of Delight! Who hast
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:103387:63"/>
the Keys of <hi>David!</hi> Spread open thine Arms of Mercy, and
receive this poor miserable Creature: Behold, this straying
Sheep, beset with Multitudes of Wolves, runs to the good Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd:
Protect me from the fiery Darts of the Enemy; embrace
me, as a tender Mother doth her sickly Child, with Bowels of
Mercy. Kill in me the base Desires of the Flesh; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
evil Inclinations thou spiest in me, root them up. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguish
in me the impure Flames of Lust. Give me an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Spirit, a Spirit active in the Practice and Exercise of
Vertue. Raise the Powers of my Soul by thy Love, that I
may love thee with all my Heart, that I may praise thee, that
I may honour thee, and think nothing tedious or troublesome
that may promote thy Glory. Repair this shatter'd Tabernacle,
and vouchsafe to dwell in it: I have wilfully ruin'd it by my
Sins, O make it whole again. Remove the Poyson, which
hath infected all my Faculties. Destroy the Serpent's Seed,
that lurks in the secret Corners of my Heart. If <hi>Adam</hi> could
not preserve his Integrity in the State of Innocence, how shall I
preserve mine in this State of Corruption, without thy special
Grace and Assistance? Thy Grace is the Treasure I want, thou
hast promised it, I beg it; O let me not go without it. O Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>su!
Thou didst love me when I was thine Enemy, O hate me
not now that I am made thy Friend. When I was lost, thou
didst redeem me with thy Blood; now that I am found, O
wash me with that Blood: O let me not perish now, when
Heaven is bought, and an endless Bliss is purchased for me.
Now that the Hand-writing against me is blotted out, let me
not run into new Dangers, nor forfeit that Blessing which is
so graciously tendred to me. It is the real Desire of my Soul to
serve thee; and O that I might do it with Chearfulness, with
Alacrity, with Fervency, and with Constancy! The Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Heart is of thee, thou givest the Will; O give me
Strength to do what I desire. What can I do of my self? I
am naturally defiled, Original Sin sticks to me, Proneness to
Evil follows me; thou must stop the Current; nothing but thy
self can dry up this Fountain of Corruption; it is thy Work:
And whatever Good is in me, from thee it comes, from thy
Grace it doth proceed. Let the same Mercy uphold me, that
hath hitherto guided me; and guide me so through the Briars
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:103387:64"/>
and Thorns of Temptations, that I may not only be more than
a Conqueror through him that loved me, but may at last re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Crown and Recompence of such as overcome. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
Amen.</hi>

            <head type="sub">Of Taking the Consecrated Bread with our Hands,
and the Mystery of it.</head>
            <argument>
               <head>The CONTENTS.</head>
               <p>In the Primitive Church, the Eucharist was always taken with
the Hand: This Simplicity, in progress of Time, abandon'd;
and, as the Veneration of External Symbols advanced, the
Bread received in certain Vessels, and sometimes upon Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen
Cloth. The Superstition of the Church of Rome of
putting the Bread into the Mouth of the Communicant laid
open, and the Vanity of it shewn. The Mystery of Taking
the Eucharist with our Hands, set down in three Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
viz. To put us in mind, with what Alacrity we are
to accept of the Mercy offered us, to testifie our appropriating
of that Mercy to our selves, and to hold it fast when we
have received it. Of God's Liberality, in bidding us take
the best Gift he hath to bestow. The Impiety of those that
take Christ for their Redeemer, and continue disobedient,
discovered. The Prayer.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>I. 'TIS certain that <hi>Christ</hi> said, <hi>Take and eat;</hi> which
the Primitive Church understood of taking the
consecrated Elements with the Hand. And to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
saith <hi>Tertullian, We receive the Eucharist from none,
but from the Hands of the President or Minister of the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</hi>
It was for this Reason, that in the ancient <hi>Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies,</hi>
               <pb n="117" facs="tcp:103387:64"/>
the Deacons cried to the People, or Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants,
<hi>Extend your Hands:</hi> And upon this Account it
was, that St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> expostulating with <hi>Theodosius,</hi> about
the barbarous Slaughter he had been guilty of, tells him,
<hi>How can you stretch forth your Hands, from which, as yet,
innocent Blood drops down? How can you, with such Hands,
receive the Body of the Lord?</hi> Nor do even the Papists
themselves, who will not suffer the Lay-Communicant
to touch the Wafer with his Hand, but put it into his
Mouth, deny it. Whether every one in the Ancient
Church did take the consecrated Elements with his own,
from the Priest's or Deacon's Hand; or whether they
took it out of the Dish, into which the sacred Bread was
broken, with their own Hands, is not very material to
determine: Though whatever Passages there may be in
<hi>Clemen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> which seem to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,
that the Communicants did take the broken Bread
out of the Dish; yet most of the Ancients do agree, that
the consecrated Elements were taken from the Hands of
Ecclesiastical Persons: And though, among the <hi>Jews,</hi>
the Master of the Family, that broke the Bread, did not
always give it into the Hands of every Guest; but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
broken it, laid it upon the Table, and every one
took a Piece; yet the Practice of the Christian Church,
for Six Hundred Years at least, after Christ, sufficiently
shews how the holy Apostles took it; whom, we may
suppose, the first Churches did imitate: And as the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
took it from Christ's Hands, so the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants
afterward took it from the Apostles and their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors
Hands; which Practice continues this Day in
most Churches of the Protestants, that call themselves
<hi>Reformed:</hi> I say, in most; for in some, and particularly,
those of the <hi>United Provinces,</hi> the Communicants take it
out of the Dish, after it is broken by the Minister. It
was Ignorance and Superstition that brought in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Custom: And from hence rose that <hi>Canon</hi> in the
<hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Antisiodorum;</hi> celebrated about the
Year after <hi>Christ, 613.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Can. 36.</note> 
               <hi>That Women must not
take the Eucharist with their bare Hands, but in a Linen
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:103387:65"/>
Cloth,</hi> which they called <hi>Dominicale.</hi> Soon after, as Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and Superstition increased, some began to take the
consecrated Bread in little Vessels of Gold, or of some
other Metal; against whom the <hi>Sixth Council</hi> of <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi>
about the Year of our Lord,<note place="margin">Can. 101.</note> 676. made
a <hi>Canon,</hi> and forbad them to do so for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
but to put their Hands cross-wise, and so to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it. The Pretence in receiving the holy Bread in
some Thing, besides their bare Hands, was, that they
might not defile the Body of Christ with their Hands;
as if touching it with baser Things than their own Hands,
would be more acceptable to God: For, as <hi>Solomon</hi> tells
us, <hi>a living Dog is better than a dead Lion;</hi> so we may
with far greater Reason say, That a living Hand is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
better than all the dead Things which are made,
either of Gold, or Silver, or Brass, or any other Mineral.
But though these Abuses crept in so early, yet the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom
of receiving the holy Bread with their Hands con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
in abundance of Churches, till the latter end of
the Ninth Century; by which Time it began to be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomary
in the <hi>Western Church</hi> to put the <hi>Eucharist</hi> into
the Mouths of the Communicants, as it is practised this
Day in the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> as also among the <hi>Lutheran
Protestants.</hi> It is confessed, that a <hi>Canon</hi> was made in a
<hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Roan,</hi> about the Year of our Lord, 685. <hi>That
the Eucharist should for the future, by the
Priest,</hi>
               <note place="margin">L'Arroque'<hi>s Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Eucharist,</hi> Part 1. O. 13.</note> 
               <hi>be put into the Mouth of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municant,
whether Woman, or Lay-man:</hi>
Yet there are sufficient Testimonies ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant,
that assure us, that this <hi>Canon</hi> was not observ'd eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
where, till about the latter end of the Ninth Century.
In a Word, As Superstition grew, and the Doctrine of
<hi>Transubstantiation</hi> began to prevail, so this ancient Rite of
taking the <hi>Eucharist</hi> with the Hand, was abolished; and
the Priests of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> would not so much as
suffer Lay-men to touch the Sacramental Bread with the
Tip of their Fingers, pretending that it was only given
by <hi>Christ</hi> into the Hands of Priests; an Absurdity so
great, that by the same Rule it would follow, that the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:103387:65"/>
Laity must be totally excluded from the Sacrament, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause,
at the first Institution, it was received by none
but Priests. Nay, to that heighth of Folly did Men arise
by degrees, not only Papists, but many also that profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the Purity of the Gospel, that it was counted a great
Profanation of the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> if the People did any way
touch the sacred Bread; and therefore great Care was,
and is still, taken, even at this Day, that the Bread be
put exactly upon the Tongue of the Communicant, that
he may not touch it so much as with his Teeth; So that
under a pretence of Religion, Men are made to forbear
that, which true Religion commands to be done. And
what an Injury is it to the People, to hinder them from
touching and taking the holy Bread in their Hands,
when <hi>Christ</hi> laid down his Life for <hi>them,</hi> as well as for
the Priests? Did the Priests receive greater Benefit by
<hi>Christ</hi>'s Death, than the People? Or, were some pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
Advantages consigned to them by his Death, over
and above what is intended for the Laity? If this could
be proved, there might be some Colour for this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence:
But when all equally share in his Mercies, why
should not all take the Bread in their Hands, whereby
they remember the Benefits of his Death? Are the Priest's
Hands holier or cleaner than the People's? Would to
God they were so, not only in this Sacrament, but in all
Things! But, after all, what can be more weak, or sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
than to imagine that the holy Bread is defiled more
by the Hands and Teeth, than by the Tongue, or Bowels,
or Stomach, which receive it? Is not the Tongue a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the Body, as well as the Hand? Or, are the
Bowels, into which the Bread is received, purer than
the Hand? If it be said, that by the Hands great Sins
are usually committed, I would fain know whether grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Sins are not daily committed with the Tongue, than
with the Hand? So impertinent is this Plea, that it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
no Argument, or Answer. In
the <hi>Greek Church,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jac. Goar. in Not. ad Miss. Chrysost. p.m. 150.</note> the Custom of taking
the holy Bread with the Hand, was
kept up for many Hundred Years, till
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:103387:66"/>
of late they have got a way of mingling the holy Wine
with the Bread in a Spoon, whence the Communicants
do take it.</p>
            <p>II. As we are commanded to take the holy Bread
with our Hands, which makes it no indifferent Thing,
so we cannot suppose that Christ would command it,
without intending some Mystery in that Action; and if
it be lawful to guess, we may piously believe, that by
that Taking, he intended these following Things.</p>
            <p>1. It puts us in mind, <hi>with what Alacrity we should ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
of the unspeakable Gift, viz.</hi> The Mercy of Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation,
by the Death of <hi>Christ Jesus:</hi> As we readily
stretch forth our Hands to receive a Present that is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
to us, so ought we to accept of what a merciful
God doth so freely and so frankly bestow upon us. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
of it! You will say, Who can be supposed to refuse
it? Will a Malefactor scruple to accept of his Prince's
Pardon? Or, If a King put a Treasure into a poor Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner's
Hands, will he scorn it, or withdraw his Hand?
'Tis true, Men are willing enough to accept of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
so they may have him upon their own Terms: If
he will give them leave to do what they please, and then
save them, they are most ready to take, and to embrace
him. But that is not the Acceptance I mean: For such
an Acceptance implies a Contradiction, as being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the whole Design of that Reconciliation: For
by his Death, he was to destroy the Works of the Devil;
and therefore to accept of him, and to cleave to those
Works he came to destroy, is to set <hi>Christ</hi> at variance
with himself. He that accepts of this Gift, must express
that Acceptance, not only by his Hand, but his Heart
too, and conform also to the Design of that Gift. For,
<hi>Is Christ divided?</hi> Shall I accept of a part, and not of the
whole? Shall I receive him as a Saviour, and not as a
Guide and Ruler too? Shall I stretch forth my Hand,
to put his Sceptre of Grace and Mercy to my Lips, and
break the Sceptre when I have done? This is impious,
and unreasonable.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:103387:66"/>
2. We take the holy Bread with our H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nds, to <hi>testifie
our Approbation of that Gift,</hi> and that we take it to our
own Use and Benefit; as he that takes Food in his Hand,
doth it to feed his own Body, and to strengthen himself.
And, indeed, <hi>Christ</hi> is willing, that the Soul that comes
to this holy Table should say, <hi>Christ</hi> is mine, for me he
suffered, for me he died, for my sake he left Heaven,
and confin'd himself to a Cradle, to a Stable, to a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger:
For me he was nailed to the Cross, for me that
precious Sacrifice was offered, and I share in all the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits
of his Death, as well as my Brother, my Sister,
my Friend, and my Neighbour: The Estate he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased
belongs to me, I have a Right to it, as well as
St. <hi>Paul</hi> and St. <hi>Peter,</hi> as well as <hi>Zachaeus</hi> and <hi>Mary Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalene:</hi>
And there is no Dispute of it, where the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municant
brings with him <hi>Mary Magdalene</hi>'s Tears, St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s
Repentance, St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Admiration of God's Love,
and <hi>Zachaeus</hi>'s Charity, he may be as confident that
<hi>Christ</hi> gives himself to him, as if he heard <hi>Christ</hi> saying
to him with an audible Voice, in the Prophet's Language,
<hi>Fear not, I have redeemed thee, thou art mine:</hi> He may justly
believe, he hears <hi>Christ</hi> saying to him, <hi>Here, Christian, take
that which is thine own, even my self, that Pardon, that
Salvation, that Peace, that Joy, that Spirit, that Comfort,
which my Death hath purchased, and my Cross hath gained.
I am thy Portion, and all that I have is thine; I am thy
Shield, and thy exceeding great Reward: Be not afraid to
apply these mighty Blessings to my Soul; for as great, as won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful,
as rich, as magnificent as they are, and as poor, as
mean, as wretched, and as naked as thou art, take them, and
wear them, tye them as a Crown about thy Head: Look upon
the bright, the everlasting Mansions of Bliss and Happiness;
look upon all that Saints and Angels do enjoy, and please thy
self with the Thoughts of it; for all is thine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. We are commanded to take the holy Bread with
our Hands, to let us know, that <hi>having accepted of this
Gift, and appropriated it to our selves, we are to hold it fast,</hi>
               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:103387:67"/>
and not to let it go again. Then we let <hi>Christ</hi> go, when
we grow cold in our Love to him, and to his distressed
Members, or to our Brethren in general. Love stays
that Bride-groom of our Souls, Love preserves his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Presence, Love chains him to our Hearts. It was
an excellent Resolution of the <hi>Spiritual Spouse,</hi> and that
Spouse are we, <hi>Cant. 3. 3, 4. The Watch-men that go <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ut
the City, found me; to whom I said, Saw ye him whom my
Soul loves? It was but a little that I passed from them, but
I found him whom my Soul loves. I held him, and would
not let him go, until I had brought him into my Mother's
House, and into the Chamber of her that conceived me.</hi> This
must be the Resolution of every Soul that is tender of
spiritual Comfort. The Way to hold him fast, is, to
kiss him with our Thoughts, to embrace him with our
Minds, to cleave to him with our Affections, to cling
to him with our Will, and to caress him with our Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience:
If he would go away from us, these are the
Charms that hold him: And the Soul that, with <hi>David,</hi>
hath Courage to say, and sincerely intends what it says,
<hi>Psal. 18. 1. I will love thee, O Lord, my Strength, my Rock,
my Fortress, my Deliverer, my Buckler, and the Horn of my
Salvation, and my high Tower,</hi> may expect as gracious an
Answer. The same we read of, <hi>Psal. 91. 14, 15, 16. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he hath set his Love upon me, therefore I will deliver
him: I will set him on high, because he hath known my Name:
He shall call upon me, and I will answer him; I will be with
him in Trouble, I will deliver him, and honour him: With
long Life I satisfie him, and shew him my Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The Preceding Considerations reduced to Practice.</head>
               <p>I. <hi>HERE we may take a View of the immense Bounty of
our Master, to his Church and People.</hi> Our Saviour
<hi>pathetically</hi> describes it, <hi>Mar. 12. 1.—7.</hi> For, according
to the different Conditions of his Church, he sent various
Servants, to check them, to admonish them, to warn
them, to represent to them the Joys and Torments of
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:103387:67"/>
another World; and though not a few of these Servants
were persecuted, stoned, killed, abused, and some met
with cruel Mockings, with Bonds and Imprisonments,
yet that did not discourage him; and having therefore
yet one Son, his Well-beloved, he sent him also last unto
them, saying, <hi>They will reverence my Son:</hi> And this Son
he bids us take; and with him, all Things that can make
us truly happy. And though it is true, the covetous and
sensual Man would have taken it more kindly, if God
had bid him take Chests of Gold, and Talents of Silver,
rich Houses, and richer Lands; yet had those Gifts been
very mean, and unworthy of his Wisdom and Holiness.
His Gift, like himself, must be spiritual and great; and
in bidding us take his Son, with all the Benefits of his
Death, he bids us take the most inestimable Mercy, and
that which must make us rich, and great, and glorious,
to Eternal Ages. If he had bid us take the World, and
the Fulness thereof, there had been no great Self-denial
in that Offer: But to offer the Son of his Love, and to
bid us take him as our own, whereby we enjoy all his
Wealth and Treasures, the Self-denial is so great, that the
Sacred Writers know not how to express it, and therefore
use such Words as may serve to feed our Admiration; <hi>So
God loved the World, that he gave his only begotten Son:</hi> And
the Word <hi>so,</hi> implies so vast an <hi>Ocean</hi> of Love, that the
Understandings both of Angels and Men, may lose
themselves in the Contemplation or Survey of it.</p>
               <p>II. Here I cannot but reflect on the Rudeness of some
that take him indeed, but it is as the Soldiers at his Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
took him, <hi>by Force and Violence.</hi> There are Thousands
that will take him for their Saviour, whether he will or
no: Though he hath protested that he will say to those
who would not do the Will of his Father which is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<hi>I know you not, depart from me, ye Workers of Iniquity;</hi>
yet these very Persons will lay hold on him, and will be
saved by him, in despight of him; and therefore do not
only assemble with other Christians, under the Cross, at
the holy Table, and there pretend to take him to their
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:103387:68"/>
Comfort, as well as the best of them; but on their Death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beds
too, after they have abused him by their carnal and
sensual Lives, lived like his Enemies, lean upon him, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon him, lay hold on his Merits, support them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with his Sufferings, and stay themselves on him, as
if they were resolved he should not shake them off: This
is a Rudeness that admits of no Excuse. Not but that he
is ready enough to refresh those that lay hold on him as
they should do; but where Men's Hearts remain unsan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified,
unholy, unresolved to walk in the Light, as he
was in the Light, unaffected with the Love of God, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touch'd
with a Sense of Sin; there to hope, and be confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
they shall be saved by his Merits, is to make <hi>Christ</hi>
a Patron of their Sins, and an Encourager of Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,
and to charge him with a Lye, as if, contrary to what
he hath so often affirmed, asserted, repeated and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by Miracles too, not those that have followed him
in the Regeneration, but those whose Hearts and Lives
were never changed, shall sit upon Thrones when the Son
of Man shall sit upon the Throne of his Glory, <hi>Mat. 19. 28.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>III. From hence it is evident, that to take <hi>Christ</hi> for
our highest and chiefest Good, a Man must believe there
is something to be got by him, which the World cannot
give, and beyond all that the World can afford: And
this Belief must not be slight or superficial, but a Belief
that considers the Consequence and Importance of this
Truth; not a Belief of Speculation, but a Belief that
rouzes the Soul from her Slumber. A Man that doth not
heartily believe that the greatest, the best, the choicest
Satisfaction flows from the Possession of this Treasure,
will never labour, or toil, or put himself to Trouble to
get Possession of it. So that, if ever we take the Lord
<hi>Jesus</hi> according to the Rules laid down in the preceding
Discourse, so as to accept of him upon his Terms, to
appropriate him to our selves, and to hold him fast, we
must sit down, and in cool Blood consider, whether that
Bliss and Happiness is to be found in him, which the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
speaks of; and to weigh that Happiness, how far
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:103387:68"/>
it transcends all other Felicities and Comforts of this
World; end not to rest, till we are fully persuaded of
the Truth and Reality of it: And this Persuasion will,
in a manner, force and compel us to take him so, as,
with the Merchant in the Gospel, to sell all we have,
for that inestimable Pearl.</p>

               <p>O Jesu! My All, my Sun, my Light, and the Glory of

counter-balances and out-weighs all that the World can call
rich, and excellent, and beautiful: They that enjoy thee, walk

Teach me, how I may be thy Disciple; Teach me, how I may

Expressions in the Fathers, concerning this holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
which are not to be taken literally. The same
Expressions made use of still, but to be understood according
to the Analogy of Faith. The same Way that Man was

excellent Duties. The Prayer.</p>

these few Words have caused in the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian

and that particularly for which I have hitherto been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous,
and which teaches, That the Bread and Wine which
are set upon the Altar, are only a Sacrament after Consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or a Representation, and not the very Body and Blood
of our Lord Jesus Christ; and that they cannot sensually, but
only in a Sacramental or Representative Way, be handled by
the Priest, and broken and bruised by the Teeth of the Faithful.
But I do consent to the Holy</hi> Roman <hi>Church, and to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolick
See; and profess with my Lips and Heart, that I hold
that Faith concerning the Sacrament of the Lord's Table, which
our Lord, and Pope</hi> Nicholas, <hi>and this Holy Synod, have,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:103387:70"/>
by Evangelical and Apostolical Authority, commanded to
be held, and prescribed to me,</hi> viz. <hi>That the Bread and
Wine which are place upon the Altar, after Consecration, are
not only a Sacrament, but the very Body and Blood of our
Lord Jesus Christ; and are sensually, and not only Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally,
but in truth, handled by the Hands of the Priest,
and broken and bruised by the Teeth of the Faithful. And
hereunto I swear by the Holy and Individual Trinity, and by
these Holy Gospels.</hi> This was the gross and absurd Doctrine
of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in that Age; so absurd, that even
their Champions who came after were afraid of it, being
sensible that <hi>Christ</hi>'s glorified Body could not be handled,
and bruised, and ground with the Teeth. Which made
the <hi>Glossator</hi> in <hi>Gratian,</hi> reciting this
Recantation,<note place="margin">Distinct. 2. de. Consecr. Can. 74.</note> adds, <hi>If you do not take
these Words in a sound Sense, you will fall
into greater Heresie than</hi> Berengarius. Yet the Gentlemen
of this Church are past blushing; and though there be
nothing more inconsistent with the common Principles
of Mankind, than this <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> yet they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
to maintain that with Noise and Clamour, which
they cannot do with Reason and Argument; and though,
as they explain this Doctrine, it be rather an Annihila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Bread, or Substitution of <hi>Christ</hi>'s Body, than
a <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> yet a <hi>Transubstantion</hi> it must be: And
that the Vulgar may not stumble at it, abundance of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
are invented, to support it: How St. <hi>Anthony</hi> of
<hi>Padua</hi>'s Horse forsook his Oats, to do Obeysance to the
Body of <hi>Christ,</hi> or the Wafer, after it was <hi>Transubstantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:</hi>
And how others have seen the Wafer bleed, when
by <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Infidels</hi> it hath been prick'd: And how
others have seen a Child appear to them, instead of the
Wafer: How, upon St. <hi>Gregory</hi>'s Prayers, the Wafer
hath been changed into substantial Bloody Flesh: How
a Protestant denying <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> and saying, that
a Spider deserves as much Reverence and Adoration as
the Wafer in the Sacrament, they being both God's Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
an huge black Spider immediately spun her self
down from the Ceiling, into his Mouth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And these
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:103387:70"/>
Miracles <hi>Bellarmine</hi> brings for Proofs
and Arguments.<note place="margin">Lib. 3. de Euch. cap. 8.</note> But to examine the
Do&amp;rine it self, how impossible it is,
that these Words should infer such a Conversion, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
from hence:</p>
            <p>1. Because no Reason can be given, why these Words,
<hi>This is my Body,</hi> should infer such a Change, any more
than the Words, <hi>Take, eat;</hi> For the one, as well as the
other, were spoken by <hi>Christ</hi> at the same Time, and in
one Breath.</p>
            <p>2. 'Tis impossible that these Words should infer any
such Change of the Bread into real and substantial Flesh:
For it would follow, that Christ had spoken what was
false, and the Disciples, that were present, and to whom
he spoke these Words, might have easily convinced them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
of the contrary. That before <hi>Christ</hi>'s Ascension
into Heaven, they had no very Metaphysical Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings,
nor very quick Apprehensions, any one may
guess, that hath but read the Evangelical History.
They that had been present at so many Miracles Christ
wrought, and convinced themselves of the Reality of
them by their Senses, that if there had a Miracle been
wrought in this Sacrament, they would, without Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute,
have examined it by their Senses; and having
seen no real Conversion or Change of the Bread before
them into his Natural Body, would have disputed <hi>Christ</hi>'s
Assertion, and given him an Account of the Reason of
their Unbelief: For they had seen the Miracle of his
changing Water into Wine, and convinced themselves
by their Taste and Eye-sight, that there was a real
Change wrought; and therefore, if such a miraculous
Change had been wrought here, and they could not
have perceived it by any of their Senses, can any Man
imagine they would have been silent, aud not contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
it? There cannot be a greater Miracle, than to
change Bread into Flesh: And if the Bread, which was
before the Disciples, upon the Table, had been changed
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:103387:71"/>
into Christ's Body, and they had perceived no such
Thing by any of their Senses, they would have been
amazed more than the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> at the Message the
Angel brought her, of conceiving without the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of a Man. They saw Christ sitting at the Table,
they saw the Bread in his Hand, they saw the Bread af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Consecration, they saw his Body and that Bread
were different Things, they did not see him vanish out
of their Sight; Christ continued to be as he was, and
so did the Bread; and therefore could not but take these
Words to be spoken in a spiritual Sense. There was
never any Miracle wrought, but what was intended to
convince the Senses of Men; and they could either taste,
or see, or smell, or feel, or hear it: Nay, the Design of
a Miracle is clearly lost, if it convinces not the Senses;
for the Design is, to surprize, or rather to persuade Men
into Belief, by their seeing that, which they cannot but
conclude, is wrought by the Finger of God. Except
the Senses are convinced, the Miracle is wrought in vain:
And that so great a Miracle, as changing Bread into
Christ's Natural Body, should be wrought, and no Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
be able to perceive it by their Senses, is a Thing so
absurd, that it destroys the Nature of a Miracle. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi>
one of the Twelve, who was so difficult in believing
Christ's being risen, that he would not give Credit to
Eye-witnesses, and his Fellow-Disciples, that had seen
him, except he put his Finger in the very Marks of his
Nails, and thrust his Hand into his Side; how would he
have believed this <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> if he had not seen
the least Appearance of it, or seen the Bread continue
Bread, and Christ continue sitting at the Table, as he
had done before? Not to mention, that if we must not
believe our Senses, what Assurance have we of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
the Stress whereof must be laid upon Christ's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection,
and the Apostles and others seeing him risen,
after he had been dead? And how can any Man be sure
there are such Words in the Bible, as, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> if
he may not believe his Eye-sight?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="131" facs="tcp:103387:71"/>
3. <hi>This is my Body,</hi> differs very much from <hi>This is
Transubstantiated,</hi> or <hi>Changed into my Body,</hi> or <hi>Let it be
changed into my Body: This is my Body,</hi> speaks, what is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
in Being; not what may, or shall be effective of
something else. <hi>To be,</hi> and <hi>to be changed</hi> into a Thing,
are quite different Expressions: And he that says, a
Thing <hi>is,</hi> or <hi>hath a Being,</hi> cannot be therefore supposed
necessarily to say, that it is changed, or transubstantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
or shall be so; for a Thing may <hi>be</hi> several Ways,
besides being changed. That, of which Christ affirms,
that <hi>it is his Body,</hi> was the Bread he took in his Hand,
or that which he broke; and that may be said to be his
Body several Ways, without being changed or transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiated
into his Body: Which very Thing hath made
the wiser and more judicious Papists confess, that these
Words do not necessarily infer a <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Decree, Order and Explication of the Church;
upon which they chiefly build their Doctrine and Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And how ridiculous this Explication of their
Church is, any common Capacity may perceive, that
doth but understand <hi>Grammar,</hi> and the ordinary Way of
speaking in all Countries and Languages whatsoever:
For, What can be more common, than to say, <hi>Such a
Man is a Fox,</hi> and <hi>Such a Person is a Lion,</hi> and <hi>Such a
Neighbour is a Beast,</hi> and <hi>Such a Boy is a Tyger?</hi> But doth
any Man of common Sense infer from thence, that such
a Person is transubstantiated into a Fox, or Lion, or Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger?
'Tis true, God can do all Things; but his Power
is one Thing, and his Will another; and to believe he
will do that which he hath no where said, or promised
to do, is notorious Presumption: And though we are
not presently to reject a Thing, because our Reason can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
comprehend it; yet it is fit that what we cannot
comprehend with our Reason, we should be sufficiently
assured of, that God hath revealed it: Such as is the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> the <hi>Incarnation</hi> of our Lord, and the
future <hi>Resurrection, &amp;c.</hi> And if we had but as good
Ground for <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> as we have for these My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries;
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:103387:72"/>
not only God's express Revelation, but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
Doctrine of the Church, no wise Man would dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
it. <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> is a Thing, which neither the
Scripture, nor the Primitive Church, did ever acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge:
And there being nothing in the Word of God to
establish it, and being, besides, contrary to all Sense and
Reason, we must be first <hi>given up to believe a Lye,</hi> as some
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap>, it seems, are, <hi>2 Thess. 2. 11.</hi> before we can give <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
unto it. It were endless to repeat here all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions
and Absurdities that this Doctrine may be
charged with; for Mice and Vermine will eat the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated
Wafer, if it lies in their Way: It destroys not
only the Nature of Christ's Body, but a principal Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
of our Belief too; which saith, That <hi>Christ is ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
and sitteth at the Right Hand of God; whom the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
must receive, until the Time of the Restitution of all
Things,</hi> Act. 3. 21. Not to mention, that the Apostle
calls the Bread in the Sacrament, even after Consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Bread still, <hi>1 Cor. 11.</hi> And that this Doctrine cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
the Nature of a Sacrament, and is confuted by Christ's
saying, <hi>Do this in remembrance of me;</hi> which supposes that
he is absent as to his Body, which was crucified, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
Nor will that Place, <hi>Joh. is. 55. My Flesh is Meat indeed,
and my Blood is Drink indeed,</hi> do any great Service to our
Adversaries in this Controversie: For if it be <hi>Meat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,</hi>
how doth that infer that the Bread must needs be
transubstantiated into his Flesh, since his Flesh may be
Meat indeed several Ways? For, to all true Believers,
that take Comfort in his Death, and are released from
Sin, and the Snares of the Devil, by his Flesh that was
nailed to the Cross, he may be truly said to be <hi>Meat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,</hi>
and <hi>Drink indeed,</hi> because their Souls are comforted
by the Remembrance of it, and preserved to Eternal
Life; and though he be only spiritual Meat to them,
yet he is so <hi>indeed,</hi> and <hi>really,</hi> and in a very good Sense:
As we say of a comfortable Word, spoken to a troubled
Conscience, That that <hi>Word</hi> is Meat and Drink to it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
and doth it more Good than all the Meat and
Drink in the World would have done: And that all
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:103387:72"/>
that Discourse, <hi>John 6.</hi> is to be understood of Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Meat and Drink, whereby the Soul receives comfort
and refreshment, <hi>Christ</hi> himself hath declared, <hi>Joh. 6 63.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>II. As these words, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> do not infer a
<hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> so neither do they import a <hi>Consub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation,</hi>
a word as hard as the former, and which
hath been taken up by the <hi>Lutheran Protestants,</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
their Opinion, that Christ's Glorified Body is <hi>in,
with,</hi> and <hi>under</hi> the Element of the Bread in the Holy
Sacrament, or hid under it; a Doctrine which they
ground upon the Ubiquity of Christ's Body, or being
every where and in all places; which Priviledge, they
fancy, was communicated to <hi>Christ</hi>'s <hi>Human</hi> Nature,
by its being joyn'd with the <hi>Divine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> a thing so irratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
that hereby they confound the Divine Nature with
the Human: And to say, that <hi>Christ</hi> had a Body, which,
as all other Bodies, must have Dimensions, heighth and,
breadth, and depth, and length, and yet to make that
Body every where present, is a conclusion so weak, that
I am apt to believe, that if it had not been pitch'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by <hi>Luther</hi> in a heat or passion, he would never have
embraced it. For indeed, this was the infirmity of that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Man, who, tho' otherwise very much mortified in
his desires after the Riches, Honours and Glories of the
World, yet could not endure to be contradicted, nor
yield to another Man's Opinion, tho' much sounder,
because himself was not the first inventer of it. And
by what I can see from History, this was one great
reason, why he differ'd from <hi>Zwinglius</hi> in the point of
the Holy Sacrament, and embraced <hi>Consubstantiation,</hi>
which implies, as is said already, that the Body of Christ
is hid under the substance of the Bread; a Point that
transported him into very great passion, which made
him afterward, upon his Death-bed deplore, That he
had been too hot in his Controversie. He that gave
the first hint of this Opinion, was <hi>John Gerson,</hi> Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor
of <hi>Paris,</hi> who about the time of the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,</hi>
not being able to digest the absolute Doctrine of
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:103387:73"/>
               <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> and finding that Assertion to be full
of Blasphemy and Idolatry, found out this expedient,
as he thought, That <hi>Christ,</hi> as he was a Creature, and had
a Body finite, could not be at one and the same time in
divers places, yet being united to the Divine Nature
in one Person, the Human Nature, by that conjunction
had obtained, and did obtain that Prerogative, that in
the <hi>Lords Supper only,</hi> and at no time else, it had the
priviledge to be in many places at once. About 150
years after him, one <hi>James Faber</hi> of <hi>Stapula,</hi> enlarged
this Privilege of Christ's Human Nature, and what
<hi>Gerson</hi> had restrain'd only to the Sacrament, he extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the whole World, and made Christ's Human Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
as extensive, as his Divinity: <hi>Luther</hi> afterward, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
fond of this Opinion, establish'd it in the
Churches of <hi>Saxony,</hi> insomuch, that he aver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>'d <hi>Christ</hi>'s
Body was as much in a Baker's Shop as in the <hi>Eucharist;</hi>
only in the Shop, he did not desire to be taken and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipp'd,
because he had not tyed himself to a Shop by
any word of Promise: Nay, that his Body was in the
very Rope, wherewith <hi>Judas</hi> hang'd himself, and went
through doors that were lock'd, and through the very
Stone, that was laid upon his Sepulchre. A strange
fancy! For certainly Christ's Body was Crucified at
<hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and not in all places of the World; and
when he fate at Table with his Disciples, he did not sit
at the same time at <hi>Rome,</hi> or in the <hi>East-Indies.</hi> How
near this Doctrine approaches to the errors of the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cionites</hi>
and <hi>Manichaeans</hi> of old, who taught, that <hi>Christ</hi>
had no real or substantial Body, but only a Bodily Shape;
and that when he was felt, and found to have Flesh and
Bones, it was only by special Dispensation; how near
this Doctrine, I say, approaches these Errors, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd
by the Antient Church, I will not determine.
It cannot be denied, that <hi>Luther</hi> was not always the same,
and sometimes he seem'd to deny, what he asserted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
But still those among the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> that are for
this Ubiquity, make him the Great Patron of their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.
And though some of them give out, that they
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:103387:73"/>
do not assert the Ubiquity of Christ's Body so much, as
his Omnipresence, yet it will be a hard matter to shew,
how Ubiquity and Omnipresence differ. Some pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
that the fore-mention'd expressions were not <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>'s
expressions, but foisted in by some, that would
fain take Sanctuary at his Books, for the defence of their
Opinions; But the composers of the History of the
<hi>Augsburg Confession,</hi> are ashamed of this Conceit; and
the Elector of <hi>Saxony,</hi> when in the Year 1574. he came
to examine the thing, found, that it was only an idle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,
and that in the Edition of <hi>Luther</hi>'s Works, there
was no variation used from his own words and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions:
And if <hi>Luther</hi> writes in some places against
this Ubiquity of Christ's Body, it's an argument that he
ought not to be believ'd in other Books, where he as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts
it. Thus came in Consubstantiation, and this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Churches do at this time follow, and
maintain very eagerly; And though in all other Points,
they differ very little from the Protestants of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
for with us they protest against Popish <hi>Invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of Saints, Religious Worship of Images, Human Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions,
Indulgences, Purgatory, Worship of Relicks, Prayers
in an unknown Tongue, Merit of Works, Transubstantiation,
Adoration of the Sacrament, Sacrifice of the Mass, Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy
of the Pope, pretences of Infallibility, and blind Obedience
to the decisions of Councils,</hi> &amp;c. Yet this Point they do so
stifly, and so uncharitably maintain, that the greatest
part of them refuse communion with us upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
which, as it is an error, so we believe it is no fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental
one, especially, since all this while they are
against <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> and <hi>Adoration of the Sacrament;</hi>
and though in the point of their Consubstantiation, they
ground themselves much upon that saying of <hi>Christ,
Matth. 28. 20. Lo! I am with you always, even into the
end of the World:</hi> Yet this is easily answer'd: For,</p>
            <p>1. From hence it doth not follow, that he will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
vouchsafe them his Bodily Presence: for he was
after this receiv'd into Heaven, and therefore could not
be present with his Body at that time.</p>

2. What he promises here, he made good, when he
sent the Holy Ghost, or the Spirit of Truth upon them;
Which Spirit, though not as to his miraculous Gifts, yet
as to his saving Graces, is with all true Believers to the
end of the World. So that,</p>
            <p>3. His being always with them, must be understood
of his Power, and Virtue, and Influence, which would
be with them, and with the Churches, they should Plant
unto the end of the World, as the Sun is in Heaven, and
with his Virtue and Influence cherishes this lower World.
And thus far we agree with them, that Christ is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
in the Holy Sacrament by his Power, and Influence,
and Gracious Assistances, which sincere Believers feel in
their worthy Receiving; But from hence, it can never
be made out, that his Body therefore is hid under the
Bread in the Holy Sacrament of the Eucharist.</p>
            <p>III. In what sense the Bread in this Sacrament, is the
Body of Christ, we may easily guess, if we explain Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
by Scripture, and compare this expression with
others, not unlike it.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>This is my Body;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Suffragatur nobis <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logia, Hebrais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, actio cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstantia, nihil non. <hi>Oeconimo Epist. ad Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancth.</hi>
               </note> i.e. <hi>This is a sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant
Emblem,</hi> or Sign, or Figure of
my Body: Or this Bread, thus broken,
represents my Body, that shall be Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified
for the Sins of the World. Thus
not only <hi>Rabanus Maurus, Erigena, Bruno,
Berengarius,</hi> and other wise Men under<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stood
it in the Ninth and Eleventh Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies,
but most of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> that lived before <hi>Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>sius,</hi>
or before 800 Years after <hi>Christ.</hi> So that, <hi>This
is my Body,</hi> is as much, as this Bread is representative
of my Body; As Bread is proper Food for your Bodies,
so my Crucified Body is proper Food for your precious
and immortal Souls: As Bread strengthens your Bodies,
so shall the Comforts and Benefits of my Crucified Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:103387:74"/>
support and fortifie your inward Man: As Bread
nourishes your mortal Bodies, so shall the Love, and
Charity express'd in my giving my Body to be Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
for your Sins, nourish your better part, and a sense
of that Love cause a reciprocal Love and Charity in
your Souls: As Bread unites with your Bodies, and turns
into the substance of your Bodies; So my Crucified Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
or Faith in me, who give my self for you, shall be
a means of my being one with you, and of your being
one with me. And this interpretation is conformable
to the sense of parallel places; <hi>I am the door of the sheep,</hi>
saith our Saviour, <hi>Joh. 10. 9. i.e.</hi> As the Door opens,
and being open'd, the Sheep are let into the Fold, so I
am he, by whose Light and Influence Men are admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
into the number of God's Children, or by my Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
they get admittance to God's marvellous Light; by
this they are let into the knowledge of the greatest My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries;
and by believing in me, Men have access to the
greatest Felicity. So <hi>Joh. 15. 1. I am the true Vine, and
my Father is the Husbandman, i. e.</hi> As the Vine hath
Branches, so I have Disciples; As the Branches are nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish'd
by the Vine, so are my Disciples by me; As the
Vine yields an excellent Juice, so my Blood is for the
healing of Mens Souls; or what a Vine is to Men on
Earth, the same am I to my living Members; and
what an Husbandman doth to his Vineyard, the same
doth my Father to the Branches, that shoot forth from
me, or to my Followers.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>This is my Body,</hi> i. e, <hi>This Bread is my Body,</hi> as the
roasted Lamb is the great Festival of the Jews, was the
Passover, <hi>i. e. The Memorial of it.</hi> This Sacrament of
the Lords Supper being instituted immediately after the
celebration of the Passover, as hath been often hinted,
the Disciples of our Lord being acquainted with that
way of speaking, could not wonder at Christ's expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
for thus the Jews used to say of the Paschal Lamb,
<hi>This is the Passover,</hi> as we may read, <hi>Exod. 12. 11.</hi> And
there was not any so rude among them, but understood
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:103387:75"/>
by this phrase, that by eating that Lamb, they were to
remember the Angels passing by the Houses of the <hi>Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites</hi>
in <hi>Egypt,</hi> to save them from Destruction. This
Sense they imbibed with their Mothers Milk: and when
the Father instructed his Children, he told them, that
by these words, <hi>This Lamb is the Passover,</hi> was meant
nothing else, but <hi>this Lamb is the Memorial,</hi> or <hi>puts us
in mind of the Passover;</hi> for so God had himself explain'd
it, <hi>Exod. 12. 26, 27.</hi> So that our Saviour in saying of
the <hi>Bread,</hi> he broke, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> brought in no new
way of speaking, but what the Disciples, and all the
Jews were already sufficiently acquainted with in Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Discourses, which makes Christ add immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
to shew that he meant no more by it, but a Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial,
<hi>Do this in remembrance of me:</hi> i. e. As the Lamb put
the Jews in mind of the destroying Angel's passing over
their Houses, so the Bread in this Ordinance puts you in
mind of my Body, that shall be nailed to the Tree of
the Cross for the Life of the World, and tells you, how
by that Sacrifice offer'd for your Souls, ye shall escape
the Everlasting Wrath of God, and the burning Lake,
prepared for the Devil and his Angels, as they did the
Destruction prepared for <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and his People.</p>
            <p>3. That <hi>Christ's Church</hi> is often called his Body, none
can be ignorant, that peruses these passages, <hi>Col. 1. 18.
Ephes. 5. 23 Ephes. 4. 12. 1 Cor. 10. 16. 1 Cor. 12. 27.</hi>
And though that Sense we have already alledg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d, be the
principal thing aim'd at in these words, <hi>This is my Body,</hi>
yet to shew how little need there is, to have recourse
either to Transubstantiation or Consubstantiation, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than run into such absurdities, we might very well
say, that the Bread is an Emblem, or Adumbration of
Christ's Body, <hi>i. e.</hi> of Christ's Church: For as that Bread
is made up of many Particles, so Christ's Church of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Members; and as those various Crums are closely
united to th'other, so the various Members ought to be
link'd together in Love and Charity, according to the
Royal Law, given by our Master, <hi>Joh. 13. 34. A new
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:103387:75"/>
Commandment I give unto you, that ye love one another.</hi> But
this we add, to shew rather, what little temptation there
is, to run our selves into inextricable difficulties in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of these words, than to express the immediate
intent of this expression. All Churches agree in't, That
Christ's Crucified Body is meant here, only the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
is, how the Bread is Christ's Body, and how Christ's
Body is present in the Sacrament; we say, it is there
spiritually, as the Bread is a Symbol, a Figure, a Sign, a
Representation, and a Memorial of Christ's Body, which
was offer'd for the Sins of the World; and this Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
is so easie, so intelligible, so agreeable to Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
expressions, and to the Analogy of Faith, that
one would think it should be impossible for Men to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict
it, except they were resolv'd to defend an Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
right or wrong, merely because it is their interest to do
so. The <hi>Romanists</hi> indeed have of late years endeavour'd
very much to perswade the World, that the <hi>Greek Church</hi>
in the <hi>Levant,</hi> is of their Opinion in the Sacrament; but
not to mention the rudeness and ignorance of those poor
Churches, which scarce understand the Principles of
their own Faith, if the Protestants had but taken the
same pains with the Modern Greeks, that the <hi>Popish Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners</hi>
do, <hi>i. e.</hi> bribed and paid them for their assent, and
consent to their Faith, they would have been <hi>Protestants</hi>
in this Article of the Sacrament, as some of them are
<hi>Papists</hi> at this present. <hi>Cyril,</hi> who was Patriarch of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi>
in the year 1622, where-ever he imbibed
his Doctrine, certainly was not for <hi>Transubstantiation;</hi>
and though by the endeavours of the Jesuits, he was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
strangled, yet that doth not make him an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick:
And though several Synods have been held by
the Greeks of late years, which have establish'd <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation:</hi>
yet it's sufficiently known, that it hath
been by instigation of those of the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion,
who spare no cost, that they may bring them to say, as
they do. However, such <hi>Greeks,</hi> as are not yet cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
by the <hi>Roman Emissaries,</hi> are so far from belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> that they know not what it is,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:103387:76"/>
and, as a late ingenious Travellr hath
observed,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sir</hi> George Whee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler's <hi>Voyage,</hi> l. 2. p. 128.</note> wonder any Man should
think them such Beasts, as to believe
such an Absurdity. But what doth it
signifie, whether the Modern <hi>Greeks,</hi> who are sunk into
gross Ignorance and Barbarism, be of our Opinion, or
no? 'Tis sufficient, that the ancient <hi>Greek</hi> Church is,
and hath been, of the same Belief with us. The Churches
of the <hi>Levant</hi> at this Day, as Learning is become a very
scarce Commodity among them, so their Opinion in a
controverted Point, is of no great Consequence: Where
they can give Proof of an uninterrupted Succession of
their Doctrine, it may be of importance; else not.
The Church of the <hi>Aethiopians,</hi> or <hi>Habessines,</hi> as they
have for many Centuries continued in the honest Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity
of their Doctrine, so their Testimony in this
Point of the <hi>Eucharist</hi> may be of some use; and by
what appears, they seem to joyn with us in this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
For, though they pray in their <hi>Liturgy,</hi> That
the Holy Ghost may descend, and come, and shine up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the <hi>Bread,</hi> that it may become the Body of Christ;
and that the Taste of the <hi>Cup</hi> may be changed, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the Blood of Christ;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>In</hi> Ludolph. <hi>Hist.</hi> Aethiop. l. 3. c. 5.</note> yet, by
what one of their own Priests confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
they believe no other Change,
but a mysterious or representative one, or a Change of
the use of the Bread, whereby from common it becomes
sacred: And so much appears from the Exposition they
give of the Words used by Christ; for they say expresly,
<hi>This Bread is my Body,</hi> and <hi>This Cup is my Blood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IV. From what hath been said, 'tis easie to conclude,
what it is to eat Christ's Body in this holy Sacrament.</p>
            <p>1. It is to <hi>contemplate Christ's crucified Body,</hi> and the
Cause and Reasons of that Crucifixion; to view all this
with our warmest Thoughts; to make serious Reflections
on his Death and Agonies, and the Bitterness of his Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
It being spoken to our Souls, not to our Bodies,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:103387:76"/>
to take and eat this Body, the Soul hath no other Way
to feed upon it, but by a pathetick Consideration of the
Particulars of that Death, and the End and Design of
God in it, and the Comforts and the Benefits that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
redound to Mankind; and such a Consideration as
affects our Souls, touches them to the quick, and puts
them on serious Enquiries into our wretched State, and
makes them break forth into Flames of Love; so that,
though Christ's Body was crucified above Sixteen Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Years agone, yet a pious Soul can eat it at this
Day, swallow the Charity which appears in it with her
Thoughts, consider who it is that is so wonderfully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
for her Safety, look upon him whom her Sins
have pierced, and take a View of that Man of Sorrows
who was bruised for her Iniquities, and wounded for her
Transgressions; and admire the Miracles that are to be
seen in all this.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>To eat Christ's Body,</hi> is, to apply the Benefits of his
Death and Passion to our Souls, and to rejoyce in them
as our greatest Treasure. As he that eats with his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
Organs, applies the Food he takes with his Hands,
to his Mouth and Body, and converts it into Blood and
Substance; so the pious Soul is pleased with this Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Meat, is refreshed by it, and applies the Benefits of
that crucified Body to her self; and with the Thoughts
of Peace, and Pardon, and Salvation, which are the
Blessings that drop from that Tree, arms her self against
the Assaults of the Devil, and the Terrours of Death;
and believing, without wavering, that those Mercies were
purchased for her in particular, and that she hath a Right
and Title to them, stands up in the evil Day, and in the
midst of Temptations, boldly cries with the Apostle,
<hi>Who is he that condemns? It is Christ that died,</hi> Rom. 8. 34.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>To make this crucified Body a Persuasive and Motive to
Holiness and Obedience:</hi> To conclude from thence, that
if he gave himself for us, to redeem us from all Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
then we must not frustrate his Expectation, nor cling
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:103387:77"/>
to that Iniquity which he came to free us from: And if
he died to purifie unto himself a peculiar People, zealous
for good Works, then we must not defile our selves af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that, nor wallow in the Mire any more with the
Swine; but cleanse our Minds from carnal, covetous
and lustful Thoughts, our Wills from Perversenes and
Stubbornness, our Affections from Fondness of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
World, and our Hands from Uncleanness. His zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Love to us, must make us zealous for his Glory; to
him we must consecrate our selves, and to be holy, as
he is holy, must be the Business of our Lives; and so to
love him, as to keep his Commandments, must hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward
be looked upon as our bounden Duty. He tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
eats this crucified Body, upon whom this Crucifixion
hath that Power, as to crucifie in him his known Lusts
and Passions, and to engage him to purifie himself from
all Filthiness, both of Soul and Body.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The Preceding Considerations reduced to Practice.</head>
               <p>I. IN all Writings, both Ancient and Modern, about
this holy Sacrament, there are various Rhetorical
Expressions used, which we must not understand literal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but as Flowers strowed upon the Herse of our Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Redeemer, and as Ornaments of Speech, to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
the Greatness of the Mystery. There is nothing
more common among the Fathers, than to call the <hi>Bread
and Wine</hi> in the Lord's Supper, the Body and Blood of
Christ; and the <hi>Cup,</hi> the Vessel in which Christ's Blood
is contained: And many times Christ is said to stand at
the Altar, and all the holy Angels waiting at the Table;
that Christ offers his Body to be bruised by the People's
Teeth, and dyes them red with his Blood; that the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements
are changed, and become the Body and Blood
of the Lord Jesus; and that after Prayer and Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving,
they are no more what they were before; and
a Thousand such Expressions besides: From which the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> presently infers, that they believed a
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:103387:77"/>
Transubstantiation, or a Conversion of the Elements in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Substance of Christ's Body and Blood; than
which, nothing can be more absurd: For if a Man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
these Saying of the Ancients, with other Passages
in their Writings, it plainly appears, that they meant no
more than that the Elements are representative of all
this, and that the Expressions they use are nothing but
Rhetorical Flourishes, to raise the People's Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and to render their Devotions brisk, lively, ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent,
affectionate and vigorous. We do the same at this
Day, when we tell you, that you come to feast with
Christ, that in this Sacrament he is crucified before you
Eyes, that you may see his Blood run down, that you
hear him groan under the Burthen of your Sins, that you
see here his Body hanging on the Cross, that you are to
stand under the Tree, and catch the precious Gore, as
Balsam for your Souls: All which is true, in a spiritual
Sense, and we do it to make you more attentive; and
set this Passion out in such lively Characters, that your
Souls may be touch'd and enliven'd; and as Things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
in brighter Colours strike the Senses more, so
we speak of these Things, as if they were visible and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible
to the outward Eyes, that your Souls may more
chearfully feed on the Kernel that lies in those Shells,
and with greater Life embrace the glorious Benefits
which come to you by that precious Sacrifice.</p>
               <p>II. By the same Way that Man was lost, by the same
Way he must recover. He was undone by eating: He
must be made whole again by eating. By eating he
died: By eating he must come to Life again. <hi>That Day
thou eatest of this Tree, thou shalt surely die,</hi> saith God:
And the same saith God of this holy Sacrament; <hi>That
Day thou eatest thereof, thou shalt surely live.</hi> The Fruit in
<hi>Paradise</hi> became a Savour of Death unto Death unto
him: The holy Bread in this Sacrament becomes a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of Life unto Life unto him. <hi>That</hi> Eating brought
him into Slavery: <hi>This</hi> gives him a Title to the glorious
Liberty of God's Children. In eating <hi>that</hi> Fruit, he
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:103387:78"/>
thought to be like God, and made himself worse than
the Beasts that perish: By eating of <hi>this</hi> Bread, he is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled
to become like unto the Son of God, by being
changed into the same Image, from Glory to Glory.
<hi>That Eating</hi> made him sick: <hi>This</hi> is <hi>Health to his Navel,
and Maerrow to his Bones,</hi> Prov. 3. 8. <hi>That</hi> brought the
Plague: <hi>This</hi> delivers from it. <hi>That</hi> filled him with
Wounds, and Bruises, and putrifying Sores: <hi>This</hi> makes
his Flesh come again, like unto the Flesh of a little Child.
In a Word, By eating, God's Favour was forfeited: By
eating, it is regained: <hi>Let</hi> Israel <hi>rejoyce in him that made
him, let the Children of</hi> Zion <hi>be joyful in their King; for
the Lord takes pleasure in his People, he will beautifie the
Meek with Salvation. Let the Saints be joyful in Glory,
let them sing aloud upon their Beds, let them praise the Name
of the Lord; for his Name alone is excellent, his Glory is
above the Earth and Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>III. See here, how rich a Meal God the Father pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares
for our Souls, even the crucified Body of his Son.
Shall we look upon that Celestial Food with dull and
careless Thoughts? Can we behold this costly Bread,
and forbear crying out, <hi>Lord! for ever give us that Bread?
Christian,</hi> if thou meanest to be saved by the crucified
Body of thy Lord, thou must needs eat of it: Not only
thy Mouth must eat the Sacramental Bread, and chew
it; but thy Soul must ascend, and employ her self in
eating of the crucified Body, represented by that Bread.
Thy Soul, thy Mind, thy Will, thy Affections must have
the greatest Share in eating at this Table. Thy Body
hath little to do here; that is only the Chariot, that
brings thy Soul to this Banquet: Thy Soul not being
engaged and busie here, in Thinking, Admiration, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution,
Love and Joy, the Cringes and Bowings of
thy Body will be insignificant. The End of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Eating, is Assimilation; and in our ordinary
Meals we therefore eat Food agreeable to our Bodies,
that it may be united to our Substance, mingle with
our Blood, and become one with our Bodies: So here
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:103387:78"/>
our Souls must feed on the crucified Body of the Lord
<hi>Jesus,</hi> that we may become one with him. All Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
may be said to be one with Christ, as he is God,
as he is their Creator; in which respect he fills Heaven
and Earth with his Presence, <hi>and is not far from every
one of us; and in him we live, and breath, and have our
Being:</hi> Nay, in a more particular manner every Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor
of Christianity may be said to be one with him, as
he professes the same Religion which Christ taught his
Disciples: But this is not the Union aimed at in this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament;
nor can the Union which respects our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
only, give any great Comfort to a Christian.
The Union designed by this Sacrament, is effected by
the Spirit of <hi>Christ Jesus;</hi> and the Soul that unfeigned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
see<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> here on the crucified Body of her Master, gets
the same Spirit that dwelt in her crucified Lord; which
produces the same Graces in her, that shined in that
great Shepherd of Souls; and the same Mind, the same
Temper, the same Disposition, in substance at least,
though not in the same Degree, is effected and produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
in her by this Spirit; as we see, <hi>Rem. 8. 11. Phil.
2. 5.</hi> And this is that Union every true Communicant
is to aim at, and from hence flows a Communion with
Christ in all his Privileges and Glories, whereby the
Soul is raised up together with Christ, and made to sit
together with him in Heavenly Places, though not by
way of actual Enjoyment as yet, but by getting a Right
and Title to those Privileges; as the <hi>Apostle</hi> informs us,
<hi>Ephes. 2. 6.</hi> By feeding on this crucified Body, the Soul
is nourished, and gathers Strength against her spiritual
Enemies, becomes bold in Temptations, resolute in
Dangers, couragious in spiritual Enterprizes. The Soul
that comes to feed on this crucified Body, and comes
not with this Intent, comes in vain; comes only to stare
upon the Cross, but not to be refreshed by it: The
Soul that after the Sacrament, yields wilfully to the same
Temptations it did before, is ensnared by the same sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Pleasure that ruin'd it before, is led Captive by the
same Lusts that intangled her before, certainly feeds
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:103387:79"/>
not on the crucified Body of the Lord Jesus, because
the Contemplation of that Crucifixion works no suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Effects; which if it did, the Soul would unfeigned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
destroy the Body of Sin, according to the Apostle's
Rule, <hi>Rom. 6. 6.</hi> and offer up her Body a <hi>living Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
holy, acceptable unto God,</hi> as it is said, <hi>Rom. 12. 1.</hi>
Make the Body obedient to Reason, and Sense to Faith,
and the Flesh to the Spirit, and it would keep under
the Body, and bring it into Subjection, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> did,
<hi>1 Cor. 9. 27. i. e.</hi> it would deny the Body those Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
which are manifest Hindrances to the Things of
the Spirit; it would force it to Temperance, to Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships,
to Industry and Laboriousness in God's Service;
it would strive and take care that the Body might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a <hi>Temple of the Holy Ghost, 1 Cor. 6. 19.</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> what
the Soul doth in this Ordinance, would leave such a
Sense upon us, as would not only enable, but constrain
us to glorifie God, both in Body and Soul, as the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
requires, <hi>1 Cor. 6. 20.</hi> These are the blessed Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of eating the crucified Body of the Lord Jesus:
And the Soul that feeds on that Body, will find these
happy Consequences; it will not go away empty from
this Meal; and though for the present it doth not see all
these Effects, yet there is that Impression made on her
by this Eating, that these Effects will afterward discover
themselves in her Life and Conversation.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>O</hi> My God! What Care dost thou take of my immortal
Soul, that it may not starve! Thou hast made large
Provision for my Body in the Earth, in the Air, and in the
Water: The Earth brings forth Herbs, and Roots, and Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel
to feed it: The Air affords Fowl and Feather'd Creatures
to nourish it: The Water provides Fish for it: But none of
all these can satisfie my Soul, that must have a spiritual Diet;
and rather than it shall want, thou hast given thine own Son
to be her Food! O mysterious Love! Can I, after tbis, have
low and mean Thoughts of thy Goodness! O sweetest Jesu!
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:103387:79"/>
if my Soul feeds not on thee, if must die, and be separated
from thy glorious Presence for ever: If it feeds on thee, it is
made for ever. Oh! be thou my most beloved, and most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful
Food. Thy crucified Body alone can keep my Soul from
fainting: Thy Death must yield me Life: Thy Sufferings
must give me Joy: Thy Agonies must afford me Comfort:
Thy Torments must work mine Ease: Thy Nails and Thorns
must be my Bed of Roses: Nothing else can give my Soul
Rest. When the Snares of Death and Hell encompass me, I
will lay hold on these Horns of the Altar; here I shall be safe,
safer than in the Arms of Angels: Thou that diedst for me,
livest for ever to intercede for me; and having such an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate,
I may come boldly to the Throne of Grace. O let me
not survey this glorious Provision, made for my Soul, with
carnal Eyes! O let me ponder seriously, not with flying and
transient, but with steady and fixed Thoughts, how thou hast
favoured, how thou hast loved, how thou hast dignified this
miserable Soul of mine, that I may rejoyce in thee for ever
and ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>

            <head type="sub">Of remembring Christ in this Sacrament, or do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what we do here, in remembrance of him</head>
            <argument>
               <head>The CONTENTS.</head>
               <p>The Death of Christ Jesus, the principal thing to be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
in this Sacrament. What kind of Death it was, shewn
in four Particulars. How this Death is to be remembred:
The Benefits of this Remembrance laid down. Though
the Death of Christ be the principal thing, that is to be
remembred in this Sacrament, yet that puts no stop to other
Remembrances. Christ's Example makes it lawful to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the memory of any signal Mercy or Providence we
meet with. Those that do not remember Christ's Death in
this Sacrament, do very much forget themselves. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of his Death, a Motive to forget the World,
and the Vanities of it. This Remembrance, the best De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensative
against Sin. The Prayer.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>I. AS these words, <hi>Do this in remembrance of me,</hi> do
necessarily import the Bread in this Sacrament,
to be a <hi>Memorial</hi> of Christ's Crucified Body, or that
which is to put us in mind of it, and consequently sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
that Christ's real Body is absent; so how Christ
is to be remembred here, must needs be worth our se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
enquiry: What Christ calls <hi>Doing in remembrance of
him,</hi> the Apostle, the best Interpreter of his words, stiles,
<hi>Shewing forth his Death,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 26. So that his <hi>Death</hi>
               <pb n="149" facs="tcp:103387:80"/>
is the thing, that is to be remembred here by all the
Communicants: And that this Death is worth our se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
remembrance, will easily appear, if we consider,
what Death, the Death of <hi>Christ Jesus</hi> was: For,</p>
            <p>1. <hi>It was the Death of God:</hi> According to the Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Person dying, so his Death is more or less sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing;
hence the Death of a King makes a greater
noise in the World, than that of a Peasant. The Death
remembred here, is the Death of the King of Kings;
and though, as God, he could not dye, yet it may tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be said, that he that was God, did die, not in his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,
but in his Humanity; not as dwelling in a Light
inaccessible, but as dwelling in a Tabernacle of Flesh.
<hi>Plutarch</hi> relates, that he had heard his Master
<hi>Epitherses</hi> tells this Story,<note place="margin">De Defect. Orat.</note> How in the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
<hi>Tiberius</hi>'s time, under whom Christ suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
intending to Sail into <hi>Italy,</hi> he went aboard of a
Ship, laden with many Goods and Passengers: One
Evening, coming near certain Islands call'd the <hi>Echi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nades,</hi>
the Wind slackening, and the Ship being becalm'd,
with a slow pace they arriv'd at last at the <hi>Isle of Paxae.</hi>
Several of the Seamen and Passengers sitting up that
Night and drinking, on a suddain from off the Island
came a Voice, calling to <hi>Thamus,</hi> the Master of the
Ship, thrice, <hi>When you are come as far as the</hi> Palodes,
<hi>proclaim, that the Great</hi> PAN <hi>is dead.</hi> The Master and
his Company, doubtful what to do, whether they should
do according to the import of the Voice, or no, resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
at last, if the Wind favour'd them, to pass by the
<hi>Palodes,</hi> and say nothing; but if they were becalm'd
about that place, then to cry as they were directed.
So sailing on, and coming to the place, they found
themselves strangely becalm'd, whereupon, <hi>Thamus</hi>
call'd aloud, <hi>That the Great</hi> PAN <hi>was dead;</hi> which
words he had no sooner spoken, but great Howlings,
and Sighings, and Lamentations were heard. By <hi>PAN,</hi>
the Heathens meant the God of the Universe, or him
that rul'd, govern'd and influenced all; and it's proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:103387:81"/>
this Voice had relation to Christ Jesus, who suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
about that time at <hi>Jerusalem;</hi> and that upon the
news of this Death, Howlings were heard, it's very like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
this noise was made by Fiends and Devils, whom the
Death of the Son of God, filling all in all, put into those
excesses of consternation and sorrow. And lest any
Man should object, That the Furies of Hell had no
reason to mourn at his Death, but might rejoyce rather,
that their great <hi>Antagonist</hi> was gone; it must be noted,
That they feared the Power and Virtue of that Death,
such Virtue, as in a short time would make all the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of Darkness tremble, and destroy their Empire.
When <hi>Abner, Saul</hi>'s General, was carried to his Grave,
King <hi>David</hi> follow'd the Herse, and said, <hi>Know ye not,
that there is a Prince, and a great Man fallen this day in Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi>
2 Sam. 3. 38. If such a death as <hi>Abner</hi>'s deserv'd
to be taken notice of, what must we think of the Death
of the Lord Jesus? Not a Great Man only, but one, of
whom it was said, <hi>Thou Lord, in the beginning hast laid
the foundation of the Earth, and the Heavens are the work
of thy Hands,</hi> Heb. 1. 10. How justly is this death re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred
by his Followers! And what a mixture of
Passions, Amazement as well as Gladness, Trembling
as well as rejoycing, ought it to cause in all Christian
Hearts, to think that our God died for us! A Captain
hath his like; a General his Fellow; a Prince may be
parallel'd with others; a King may meet with others of
his Rank and Quality; but <hi>God</hi> hath no equal.</p>
            <p>2. It was the Death of a Person, higher than the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est,
<hi>for his Enemies: Regulus, Codrus, Mutius,</hi> and among
the Jews, <hi>Moses</hi> had courage to die for their Country,
and the good of the People they were related to; but
still they were their Friends; but here a Person ador'd
by Angels, worshipp'd by all the Host of Heaven, the
Comfort of Paradise, the Joy of Seraphim, the Terror
of Devils, the Lord of Life, the Eternal Son of God,
the Brightness of his Father's Glory, and the express
Image of his Person, dies for Men, for Men miserable
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:103387:81"/>
and wretched, for Men that were Sinners, for Men
that were proper Objects of his Justice, for Men that
were haters of God, acted like Enemies, had affront<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
their Maker, Crucified their Redeemer, came
out against him, as against a Thief, who took pleasure
in trampling on his Laws, rejoyced in their Disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
had made a Covenant with Hell, conspired against
him, who had given them their Being, laugh'd on the
brink of Destruction, were Heirs of Hell, and had no
other Inheritance but Damnation; for such, this won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
Person dies, and this makes his death miraculous
and astonishing, <hi>Rom. 5. 8.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. It's Death, <hi>that Nature and all the Elements were
confounded at,</hi> and Heaven and Earth seem'd to be at
strife, which of them should be most concern'd at it;
insomuch, that we are told of <hi>Dionysius</hi> the <hi>Areopagite,</hi>
the Person mention'd, <hi>Acts 17. 34.</hi> when he was yet
under the Clouds of <hi>Paganism,</hi> that beholding the stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendous
Eclipse of the Sun, which happen'd about the
time, that the Saviour of the World died, brake forth
into this memorable saying, <hi>That certainly either Nature
was going to be dissolv'd, or the God of Nature suffer'd.</hi> If
ever Nature endur'd a Convulsion-Fit, it did now: The
Sun disdain'd to look upon the barbarity of the Murther,
and hid his Face, that he might not see his Creator die:
The Earth trembl'd, as if it were asham'd to see Men
stupid at the dreadful Spectacle: The Rocks broke, as
if they would testifie against the Sinners, that could
stand under the Cross without broken Hearts: The
Vail of the Temple was rent, as if it would chide the
Wretches, that could see the <hi>Messiah</hi> suffer, without
rending their Cloaths, and what is more, tearing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
for the crime they had been guilty of: The
Graves burst their Bands, as if they were concern'd to
see Men harden'd against all impressions of Compassion:
The Angels, we may, without danger of Heresie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
stopt in the midst of their <hi>Hallelujahs;</hi> and if
ever there was sadness in Heaven, we may suppose it
was at this time: The upper and the nether World
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:103387:82"/>
seem'd to go into Mourning, because their Lord and
Master gave up the Ghost: Thus much we are told by
the inspired Writer, <hi>Matth. 27. 51, 52.</hi> And this makes
the Death of Christ Jesus surprizing, beyond compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
and surely such a Death ought to be remembred.</p>
            <p>4. It is a Death, <hi>whereby the Person suffering merited Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Life,</hi> not only for himself, but all his Followers too:
A mighty Blessing, but such, as was a just reward of so
deep an Humiliation! It was for this Death, that the
Everlasting Father exalted Christ's Humane Nature
above Powers, Angels, Principalities and Spiritual Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
and in doing so, declar'd, what those, whose Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
he had assumed, if they did follow him in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation,
might come to, after Death, <hi>viz.</hi> Eternal
Life and Glory: And what greater Blessing can be
thought of, to enjoy all Blessings at once, and to all
Eternity? To see God, and to be ravish'd with his
Sight for ever; to enjoy Riches, Honour, Glory, Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
Dominion, Pleasure, Recreation, Houses, Lands,
in a most eminent manner; or to enjoy that, which is
beyond all these, in inexpressible degrees, and without
interruption, without ceasing, without disturbance,
without envy, without fear, without danger of losing
it, What can be greater? What can be more satisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry?
What can be more comfortable? This the Son of
God hath purchased by his Death. That Death is the
Messenger of all these Glories. In that Death all these
Treasures are amass'd, and heap'd, and piled up toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and then it must be worth remembring; nay, it
is impossible not to remember it, where all this is
believ'd.</p>
            <p>II. How this Death is to be remembred at the Table
of the Lord, will deserve our next consideration: And
most certainly a slight, transient Remembrance, such
as we pay to our friends and acquaintance, which are
absent, at our common Meals, or at other times, as we
have occasion to discourse of them, is not sufficient here;
for that's not at all agreeable to the Greatness and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitableness
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:103387:82"/>
of this wondeful Death. It must be such a
remembrance, as,</p>
            <p>1. Refreshes our Memories with that marvellous Love,
that shines in this Death. This Love must be called to
mind; even the Love of God, the Love that mov'd him
to the Kindnesses, we see, and taste, and feel, and have
experience of: The Love that mov'd him to give
us a Saviour, the Love that mov'd him to take pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of us, when we lay in our Blood, when we lay in
Darkness, and in the shadow of Death. <hi>Love, Love,
Love,</hi> must here be the <hi>Motto,</hi> the Watch-word, and
the dear Expression: And as the Martyr in <hi>Eusebius,</hi>
being ask'd divers Questions about his Name, Kindred,
Relations, Family, Country, Parents, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> still answer'd,
That he was a <hi>Christian;</hi> so if here we should be ask'd,
what we think, what we speak, what we mind, what
we come for, what we design, what our business is, or
what we delight in, <hi>Love</hi> must be the Answer to all
these Questions, <hi>Love</hi> must be the burden of our Song,
even the Love of the Holy Trinity; a Love, in which
our Life, our Happiness, and all our Hopes are wrapt
up; a Love, which nothing above and nothing below,
can give us any tolerable Image of: There is nothing
among all the Angels in Heaven, nothing in the Sun, or
Moon, or Stars, nothing among Men, or Beasts, or Roots,
or Herbs, or Stons, or Minerals, that can be said to be
truly like it; all comparisons are feeble, all resemblances
faint; no Language can reach it, no Rhetorick express
it, no Oratory describe it, no Pencil draw it; it surpas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
our Reason, transcends the brightest Understanding,
puzzels the very Angels in Heaven, and perplexes the
Spirits of Light and Glory. It is all Sea, all Ocean, all
Light; it hath no Bounds, no Shores, no Limits, and
the greatest that ever was said of it, or can be said of it,
is St. <hi>John</hi>'s Expression, <hi>1 Joh. 4. 16. God is Love, Love
it self, all Love, all Charity, all Goodness;</hi> and nothing, but
such perfection, could have loved such poor pitiful
Worms as we are: God looks upon our <hi>giving a cup of
cold Water</hi> to a Righteous Man, as an Act of Love; O
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:103387:83"/>
then what an Act of Love must it be in him, to give
us himself, to give us the dearest thing he had, even his
own Son! <hi>Jesus wept over Lazarus,</hi> Joh. 11. 35, 36. and
the Jews said, <hi>See how he loved him!</hi> But these Tears were
but drops of Water; Here the Lord Jesus is seen to
weep drops of Blood for us; <hi>O then see, how he loved us!</hi>
We were blinder than <hi>Bartimaeus,</hi> lamer than <hi>Mephibo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth,</hi>
fuller of Sores than <hi>Lazarus,</hi> poorer than <hi>Job,</hi> no,
Comliness, no Beauty, no Form, no Excellency ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
in us. <hi>Adam</hi>'s Fall had disfigurred us, defaced us,
ruin'd us; in this lamentable condition God loved us,
and gave his Son to die for us; and shall not this Love
be remembred in his Death?</p>
            <p>2. This remembrance requires calling to mind our
Sins, which were the cause of that Death. It's true,
the Love of God was the impulsive cause, but our Sins
were the instrumental cause; these brought him to the
Cross, and whoever remembers his Death, must neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily
remember that, whereby this Death was effected
and procured; this was our Sin and the Infection that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
it: But then, if I remember my Sins in the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of his Death, how can I remember them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
detestation? How can I remember them without
abhorrency? How can I remember them without arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
my Soul with resolution and arguments, to fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them? Can I look on my neglects, and not
charge them with this Death? Can I remember my
Love to the World, and not accuse it of having had a
hand in buffeting and reproaching of him? Can I think
of my Pride and Wrath, and not bid them look on the
Wounds they made in that Holy Flesh? Can I reflect
on my wantonness and lustful Thoughts, Desires, Words,
and Gestures, and Actions, and not be angry with
them for having struck Nails into his Hands and Feet?
And what is said of these particular Sins, must be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
to the rest, that we are either guilty of, or most
inclined to; they must be so remembred, as to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
to our Minds in their odious shapes, as having
been accessory to his Death; and if this be done, we
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:103387:83"/>
cannot but proclaim War against them, and maintain
that War all our days.</p>
            <p>3. With this, there must needs be remembred the
mighty Redemption, procured and accomplished by
this Death, even our Redemption from Slavery; a Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
so much the worse, because we were not sensible of
it; and so much more grievous, by how much it was Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual.
Our Bodies indeed were not laid in Iron, nor
with the <hi>Israelites,</hi> forced to make Brick without Straw:
There were no Task-masters set over us, to beat, and
would, and bruise us; we were not chained to Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phal
Chariots, nor forced to work in Mines and Gallies,
but it was far worse, our Souls, which were the far bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
part of us, were led Captive by the worst of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants;
the Law we were govern'd by, was the Law of
Sin; the Prison we were doom'd to, was Eternal Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
the Burdens, which were laid upon us, were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable,
and we were under the Power of an Usurp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
whose Smiles were Deaths, whose Favours were Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments,
and whose Kindnesses were Destruction and
Ruin; under him we labour'd and toil'd in vain, and
when at night, after our Travel, we looked for Wages,
we could expect nothing but Fire and Flames: We read
of <hi>Dracula</hi> the <hi>Transylvanian,</hi> that having one day invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
all the Beggars and poor Men he could light of, to a
splendid Dinner or Entertainment, after they had filled
their Bellies, he set Fire to the Hall where they were,
and burnt them all: The same Fare we must have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
of that Tyrannical Master, under whose Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage
we groan'd, but from this Slavery the Son of God,
by dying for us, redeemed and rescued us: A Mercy,
which as it deserves to be remembred above all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverances
that ever happened to us, so where can the
remembrance be more proper, than in the Sacrament
of his Death and Passion?</p>
            <p>4. In vain is all this remembred, if we do not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
to imitate this Saviour in his Self-denying Acts; for
therefore all this Mercy and Love, and Charity, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
to us in this Sacrament, that it may be an
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:103387:84"/>
Obligation upon us to deport our selves in the World af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
his Example: So that, as he prayed for his Enemies,
so must we; as he blessed them that cursed him, so must
we; as he freely forgave the Men that wronged him,
so must we; as he died for the Truth, so must we; as
he defended it to the last, without wavering, so must
we; as he would not suffer any outward Respects to
discourage him from Conscientiousness, so neither must
we; as he, before his Foes, witnessed a good Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
so must we; as he did Good for Evil, so must we;
as he shewed Pity to Men in distress, though they had
affronted and done him an Injury, so must we; as he
bore his Cross contentedly, so must we; as he despised
the World, so must we. He that remembers not his
Death, so as to endeavour to be like him, forgets the
End of his Redemption, and dishonours the Cross, on
which his Satisfaction was wrought: For the Honour
due to the Cross of <hi>Christ,</hi> is not, with the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> to pray to a piece of Wood, called the Cross of
Christ, <hi>Hail Christ's Cross, our only Hope, in this most bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Passion-Week! Increase the Goodness of the Good, and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
to the Guilty give;</hi> but to live in the World as the <hi>Lord
Jesus</hi> did, who was crucified for us; and by living so,
to adorn the Doctrine of the Cross of Christ Jesus; that
is to admire and reverence his Cross.</p>
            <p>III. From such a Remembrance flow more than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Advantages; for Things are useful, according as
they are managed; and consequently, if the Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
here required, be used according to the Rules
laid down, these following Benefits will certainly ensue
upon it. For,</p>
            <p>1. Hereby our Love to God is kindled and renewed:
Love kindles Love, as Fire kindles Fire; and therefore
God appears in this Sacrament, as he did to <hi>Moses</hi> in
the Bush, all in Flames of Love, that those Flames may
warm our Breasts: And, O happy Soul, that feels those
Flames warm and heat all that is within her! When
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:103387:84"/>
Love takes possession of the Soul, or rather, when the
Love of God, represented in the Sacrament, raises Love
in the holy soul, then the Soul becomes the Seat of Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
the Tabernacle of Holiness, the Chamber of the
Celestial Bridegroom, a spiritual Heaven, a Field which
the Lord hath blessed, a Spouse dearly beloved, a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
of Pleasure, the Marriage-house, a Paradise of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
into which the Lord descends, not to find out the
Malefactor, and to discover his Nakedness; but to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troth
to himself the beloved Virgin, languishing with
Love waiting for her Beloved, and longing for the
Bridegroom's Coming: And where this Divine Love
takes place, there the Love of the World expires; for,
as St. <hi>Austin</hi> speaks, <hi>He cannot love that which is Eternal,
that doth not cease to love that which is Temporal.</hi> And from
this Love arise those happy Breathings,
<hi>O Fountain of Love!</hi>
               <note place="margin">Idiot. de Am. div. cap.4.</note> 
               <hi>Nothing is sweeter
than thy Love, nothing more pleasant, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more beneficial. Thy Love is not troublesome: Where
thy Love is, there is true Pleasure. It is contented with it
self, it knows no Bounds, it watches Opportunities to vent it
self, it triumphs in its own Cell, and captivates all the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties!
Thy Love, O Lord, gives Liberty, drives out Fear,
tramples upon Humane Merits: It gives Rest to the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
Strength to the Weak, Joy to the Mourners: It feels no
Weariness, it feeds the Hungry, and keeps the Faint from
sinking.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Hereby our Consciences are purged from Dead
Works. This, as it is ascribed expresly to the Blood of
the Everlasting Covenant, <hi>Heb. 9. 14.</hi> so it must be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
to the true Remembrance of that Blood in this
Everlasting Sacrament. Such a Remembrance cleanseth
the Heart, purifies the Soul, makes the Dross of Sin va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish,
and the Impurity, the Mind was oppressed withal,
wear away. Such a Remembrance, like the Gift of
Prophecy, <hi>Jer. 20. 9. is as a burning Fire shut up in the
Bones, which consumes the Hay, and Straw, and Stubble,</hi>
that annoyed the House of God: For, the Beauty of
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:103387:85"/>
God's Love makes Sin appear black and ugly, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
a Loathing of it. Hereby Holiness is advanced, and
Grace begins to flourish; and the Rubbish being remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
the Winter of Iniquity gone, the Frost in the Soul
dissolved, the Flowers of the glorious Spring appear.
This Remembrance chaseth Lust and Luxury; and
therefore those in whom it hath these Effects, are said
to <hi>wash their Robes, and make them white in the Blood of
the Lamb,</hi> Rev. 7. 14.</p>
            <p>3. Hereby Christ is invited to dwell in us: The House
being thus cleansed and swept, the Noble Guest is invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to make his Abode there. This Remembrance is
attractive; and where the Soul is thus affected with the
Remembrance of Christ's Death, he comes and inhabits
that beautiful Palace; for such a Person seems resolv'd
to keep his Word: And to him the Promise runs, <hi>If a
Man love me, he will keep my Words, and my Father will
love him, and we will come unto him, and make our Abode
with him,</hi> John 14. 23. A wonderful Favour, this! To
have him dwelling in us, who is the Light of the World,
the Light of Heaven, the Light of Angels, and the Sun
of Righteousness: And from hence flows the joyful Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation
of the Apostle, <hi>Gal. 2. 20. Nevertheless I live;
yet not I, but Christ lives in me; and the Life I now live,
I live by Faith in the Son of God, who loved me, and gave
himself for me:</hi> For this Faith enlightens the Soul, gives
it clear Apprehensions of Christ's Love, makes her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
and lively, and teaches her to <hi>overcome the World,
1 John 5. 4.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. This Remembrance is making Approaches to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and Eternal Happiness: Every fresh Remembrance
is another Step to Paradise. What an Encouragement
is this to come to the holy Sacrament! Every time we
thus remember the Death of <hi>Christ,</hi> we get nearer to the
Throne on which the victorious Son of God sits, trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phing
over Hell and Devils: For the oftner he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred
thus, the more our Souls are elevated, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:103387:85"/>
more spiritual in their Aspirations; and the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we proceed in Grace, the nearer we come to Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
Heaven, in Scripture, is compared to an Hill, and
is the Mount where God is seen: Every time we come
to the Table of our Lord, and remember him thus, we
climb higher, and mount up with Wings, as Eagles,
till at last we reach the Top, where there is a perfect
Calm, no Air, no Wind, no Tempest, no infectious
Breath, to disturb the Conquerors.</p>
            <p>IV. But though the Death of Christ be the chief Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of our Remembrance at this holy Table, yet that is
no Argument, but that we may lawfully remember some
other Things relating to his Person, or Greatness, or
Holiness; particularly,</p>
            <p>1. <hi>His Divine Life,</hi> before he was Incarnate: A Life,
which no mortal Tongue can describe: A Life, in the
Explication of which, the blessed <hi>Cheruhims</hi> themselves
must fall short: A Life, known to none, but to him who
knows all, who hath Life in himself, and is the Life, and
the Father of the Spirits of all Flesh. How truly might
he say to the <hi>Jews, Joh. 8. 58. Before</hi> Abraham <hi>was, I
am!</hi> He was, indeed, from all Eternity, lived in the
Bosom of the Everlasting Father, and his Life was most
pure, some holy, most peaceable, most pleasant, most
glorious: A Life of infinite Content, of infinite Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
of infinite Joy, and of infinite Love: A Life spent
in Eternal Love of the great Fountain of Divinity, the
express Image of which he was: A Life employed in
kind Thoughts to poor Mortals, and in Divine Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances
how their Misery might be retriv'd, their Bands
loosen'd, their Dangers overcome, their Enemies van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished,
and their Souls advanced to Celestial Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions:
A Life undisturbed by the Noise of Wars, unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with Tumults, free from all Annoyances, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molested
by the Disorders of a giddy and confused
World: A Life of Eternal Calmness, which no Waves,
no Billows, no Wind, no Storms, no Tempests could
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:103387:86"/>
discompose: A Life of perfect Serenity, and immense
Sweetness: A Life employed in the Eternal and Incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible
Enjoyment of his own Perfections, and which
the inspired King gives us a very lofty Description of,
<hi>Prov. 1.</hi> This life Christ lived, before he was pleased to visit
this benighted World with his healing Beams; and it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
us to remember this Life, that from that Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
his Humiliation, in coming to dwell among us,
may appear in livelier Colours.</p>
            <p>2. To this may be added, <hi>His laborious Life here on
Earth,</hi> after he was Incarnate: A Life despicable from
his Infancy, contemptible from his Cradle: A Life of
Poverty, a Life of great Misery, of Distress, and a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Inconveniencies: A Life he lived, to let us know,
that the meanest and most miserable outward Condition
is no Lett or Impediment to our being beloved and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed
in Heaven: A Life he lived, to shew with what
Patience and Courage we are to bear the Troubles that
a merciful God lays or sends upon us: A Life he lived,
to declare to his Disciples, that through many Afflictions
they are to enter into the Kingdom of Heaven; and are
not to promise themselves great Ease and Rest here, but
are to look for a Recompence in the Resurrection of the
Just: A Life employed in doing good, to shew, that we
are not to be idle here, but to busie our selves in that
Work which will give the greatest Satisfaction, even
working out our own Salvation with Fear and Trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling:
A Life he lived for our sakes, to facilitate our
Access to Pardon, and the Throne of Mercy: A Life
he lived, to make our Lives comfortable; and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of this Life must needs inhaunce our Esteem
of his unparallell'd Goodness, who could and would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
himself, both in the Glory of his Divinity, and the
Comforts of this present Life, for our Good, and the
Welfare of our Souls.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <pb n="161" facs="tcp:103387:86"/>
               <head>The Preceding Considerations reduced to Practice.</head>
               <p>I. CHrist's Example makes it lawful to set up Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Mercies, and to preserve the Memory
of any signal Deliverance or Providence, either by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Symbols, or by keeping Anniversaries, and Days
of Devotion. Indeed, this was a very ancient Practice,
countenanced by God, and warranted by his Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
It was from hence, that <hi>Moses</hi> preserved a Pot of
<hi>Manna,</hi> to put After-Generations in mind how God had
fed his People in the Wilderness; <hi>And</hi> Moses <hi>said, This
is the thing which the Lord commandeth; Fill an Omer of it,
to be kept for your Generations, that they may see the Bread
wherewith I have fed you in the Wilderness, when I brought
you forth out of the Land of</hi> Egypt, Exod. 16. 32. It was
from hence, that <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Rod budding, blossoming, and
bearing Fruit, was kept in the Ark, to tell Posterity,
how miraculously the Priestood was established in the
Line of <hi>Aaron,</hi> and for a <hi>Token against the Rebels,</hi> as the
Holy Ghost speaks, <hi>Numb. 17. 10.</hi> It was from hence,
that <hi>Joshua</hi> commanded Twelve Stones to be taken out
of the River <hi>Jordan; That this,</hi> says he, <hi>may be a Sign
among you, that when your Children ask their Fathers in time
to come, saying, What mean you by these Stones? Then ye
shall answer them, That the Waters of</hi> Jordan <hi>were cut off
before the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord, when it passed
over</hi> Jordan: <hi>And these Stones shall be for a Memorial unto
the Children of</hi> Israel <hi>for ever,</hi> Josh. 4. 6, 7. In imitation
of these Precedents, the <hi>Jewish</hi> Church afterward, of
their own Accord, unanimously agreed to keep an Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary,
to remember their Deliverance from the Rage
of <hi>Haman, Esth. 9. 17.</hi> Both <hi>Eusebius</hi>
and <hi>Sozomen</hi> tells us of a Statue which
the Woman,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Euseb. Hist.</hi> lib. 7. c. 17.</note> who was cured by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
of her Bloody Issue,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sozom.</hi> Hist. 1. 5. c. 20.</note> erected to
his Honour at <hi>Caesarea;</hi> which lasted a
considerable time, till <hi>Julian the Apostate</hi> pulled it down,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:103387:87"/>
and erected his own in the room of it. After such Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples,
who can think it unlawful for a private Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
to keep either a Fast, or a Day of Thanksgiving,
when either some signal Affliction hath befallen him, or
some remarkable Mercy hath happen'd to him, and to
spend that Day in Exercises of Devotion; whereby he
may either work his Soul into greater Detestation of his
his Sins, or into greater Admiration of God's Goodness?
Such Exercises the Divine Clemency accepts of, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves
of them, and blesses them with new Favours;
repeals the Judgments threatned, and confirms the Soul
in her holy Zeal, and makes those Devotions Occasions
of opening the Windows of Heaven, to shower down
larger Benedictions upon her.</p>
               <p>II. It must follow from hence, that those who do not
come to remember Christ's Death in this Sacrament,
do strangely forget themselves: How great is their Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber!
What vast Multitudes of Men and Women live in
this Neglect! O ye, that are sensible of their Sin and
Blindness, when you meet with any of them, tell them,
they forget that they are Christians, they forget that
their Lord and Master hath peremptorily commanded
them to come, and remember him in this Feast; and
that consequently they are disobedient, perverse, stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born,
wilful; and if they obey him not, are no Servants,
no Children of his: For, <hi>If he be their Master, where is
his Fear? If he be their Father, where is his Honour?</hi> Tell
them, they forget the Danger they run into, and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
the Means whereby their Souls must be snatched
from the Devil's Power, and shun the Remedy that must
give Health to their Souls; and therefore are guilty of
the highest Contempt, and set up their carnal, shallow,
bruitish Reason, againt the Infinite Wisdom of God.
Tell them, they forget they have Souls to be saved, and
how long it is before a Soul be wrought into a total Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
to Christ; and that therefore they had need be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
betimes, and tye and engage their Souls to God, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Cross of Christ, and do it often, and force them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:103387:87"/>
into an holy Life. Oh, tell them, how they will
repent, when it is too late, of their Neglect of so great
Salvation. Tell them, Christ will not remember them
in the last Day, but prosess to them, <hi>I know you not,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they were not sprinkled with his Blood, and had
not the Character of Christians on their Souls; which
will infallibly drive them into Desparation.</p>
               <p>III. See here, <hi>my Friends,</hi> what an Obligation the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of Christ's Death lays upon us all, to forget
the World, and to mind the greater Concerns above.
Christ died to the World; his Life, his Death, and all
his Actions, shewed his Contempt of this present World.
He regarded not the Vanities, the Lusts, the Recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
the Slanders, the Reproaches, the Censures of the
World; but <hi>for the Glory set before him, endured the Cross,
and despised the Shame.</hi> Can we remember his Death in
this Sacrament, and think that he did all this, only for us
to admire his Actions, without transcribing all this on
our own Lives? Surely, we may live in the World, and
yet not be of the World; we may sojourn in the World,
yet not be greedy after the World; we may mind our
Work in the World, and yet not make the World our
highest Good; we may converse with Men of the World,
and yet not set our Hearts upon the World; we may be
industrious in the World, and yet not suffer the World to
ingross our Affections; we may provide for our Families
in the World, and yet not conform to the World; we
may eat and drink in the World, and yet not participate
of the Sins of the World; we may trade and traffick in
the World, and yet not have the Spirit of the World;
we may suffer Afflictions in the World, and yet be far
from the Sorrow of the World; we may prudently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive
Things in the World, and yet be Strangers to the
Wisdom of the World: In a Word, Our living in the
World is no hindrance to our arriving to an holy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of it: And though there be some Difficulty in this
Task, yet the Necessity of the Work, and the Reward
in the World to come, and Christ's Example, and the
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:103387:88"/>
Apostles Practice, and God's Readiness to assist, and the
All-sufficiency of Grace, are Persuasives and Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
strong enough to prevail with any Soul that is not
bent upon her own Ruin.</p>
               <p>IV. The best Defensative against Sin at any time, is,
the Remembrance of Christ's Sufferings. Not only at
the Sacrament, but where-ever we are, this Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
is an excellent Shield in the Day of Battel. Art
thou walking, art thou standing, art thou sitting, art
thou going out, or coming in? Set a Bleeding Saviour
before thee: When Sinners entice thee, think of thy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's
Wounds: When thou art tempted to over-reach
or defraud thy Neighbour in any Matter, think of the
bitter Cup thy Master drank off: When any Lust, any
vain Desire rises in thy Mind, think of thy dear Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer's
Groans: When thy Flesh grows weary of a Duty,
remember who suffered on the Cross: When thou art
tempted to be indifferent in Religion, and saint in thy
Mind, look upon him who made his Soul an Offering
for thy Sin: When thou art loth to overcome, think of
him who, by his Death, overcame him that had the
Power of Death: When impatient Thoughts assault thy
Mind, think of the Lamb that before his Shearers was
dumb; and sure, under this sad Scene, thou wilt not
dare to sin. And there is this Advantage in such a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance,
that there is a Book of Remembrance writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
before the Lord, for them that speak often to one
another, and <hi>think of his Name;</hi> insomuch that he will
remember them in that Day, when he makes up his
Jewels, <hi>Mal. 3. 16.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>V. To remember <hi>Christ</hi>'s Death in this Sacrament
with greater Life and Sense, it is very necessary to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
him often at other times: And that is the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
why Christ calls himself by many familiar Names;
and the Holy Ghost gives him Titles and Epithets taken
from Things we daily see, that we might not look on
those Things, from which he takes those Denominations,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:103387:88"/>
without remembring him. To this End, he is called a
<hi>Door, Joh. 10. 9.</hi> that we might not go in or out, but
think, <hi>O thou who art the Gate of Mercy, by whom whoever
enters, will find Mercy; open thy Bosom to my wounded Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and let me find Rest in thy All-sufficiency, and the Merits
of thy Passion.</hi> For this Reason he is called a <hi>Sun, Mal.
4. 2.</hi> that we might not view that splendid Luminary,
without thinking, <hi>O thou glorious Light, that didst shine to
those that sit in Darkness; shine into my Soul, dispel the Clouds
that darken my Understanding, and warm my Heart, that it
may long for thy Salvation.</hi> Hence it is, that he is stiled
the <hi>Morning-Star,</hi> that whenever we take notice of that
Son of the Morning, of that Harbinger of the Day, we
might reflect, <hi>O thou who tellest the Number of the Stars,
and callest them all by their Names; rise, rise unto me, and
irradiate my Inward Man, that I may delight in Vertue. Be
thou my Guide, lead me to thy Kingdom, keep me from going
astray, and preserve me, that I may be thine for ever.</hi> It is
from hence that he is called <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega, Rev. 1. 8.</hi>
which are Letters of the <hi>Alphabet,</hi> that we might not look
upon Letters in a Book, without thinking, <hi>Lord, be thou
the First and the Last in all my Actions: Let me begin with
thee, and end with thee: Be thou my Book; let me read the
Characters of thy Love, and rejoyce in thee for ever.</hi> For
this Cause he is styled a <hi>Shepherd,</hi> that whenever we cast
our Eye upon a Man of that Employment, we may beg
of <hi>Christ to feed us with his Spirit:</hi> And a <hi>Lamb,</hi> that when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
we see one, we may intreat him <hi>to cloath us with his
Innocence:</hi> And a <hi>Sower,</hi> that whenever we see the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band-man
throwing Seed into the Ground, we may
beseech him to <hi>manure the Ground of our Hearts, that we
may be neither barren nor unfruitful in the Knowledge of our
Lord Jesus Christ.</hi> And he that thus remembers him, in
Season, and out of Season, will, without dispute, be the
better able to remember him in this Sacrament: And to
such a Soul, <hi>David</hi>'s Saying may justly be applied, <hi>The
Righteous shall be had in Everlasting Remembrance; surely he
shall not be moved for ever,</hi> Psal. 112. 6.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>O</hi> Blessed Redeemer, who didst remember me when I had
forgetten thee, and thoughtest of me when I did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
thee! When I lay buried in the common Mass of Corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption,
thou didst not disdain to think on this forlorn Creature!
Thou didst pity me, thou sawest my Misery, and it grieved
thee at thy Heart: Thy Bowels yearn'd over me, and thou didst
spread thy Mantle over me! O happy Remembrance! I had
been lost if thou hadst not looked upon me, I had been undone
if thou hadst not cast thine Eye upon me; yet how loth have I
been to think of thee! What an Aversion have I had from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring
thee! How have I shifted off all serious Reflections
on thy Love! I have more delighted in Trifles, than in thee!
How sweet have the Thoughts of my Corn, and Wine, and Oil
been to me; and how tedious, how irksome all Contemplation
of tbee! When thou hast sometimes put me in mind of thy Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings,
how have I suffered Worldly Thoughts to drive thee out
of my Mind! How justly mightest thou turn thy Eyes away,
and hide thy Face from me! O Sweet, O Glorious Object! Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
in thy Beauty, appear in thy Glory to my Mind; that I
may be throughly convinced that nothing deserves my Thoughts
so much as thy self. I am resolved to remember thee with
greater Delight and Constancy: Help thou me. Should not I
remember thee, who hast in a manner forgotten thy self, to
remember me! I can remember a Temporal Deliverance; and
shall not the Deliverance of my Soul, procured by thy Death,
be remembred by me! I can remember a Disaster, which hath
some Years agone befallen me; and shall not I remember the
infinite Misery, from which thou camest to rescue me! I will
think of thee in the Night-Watches, I will think of thee when
I lie down, when I awake, when I rise again. In the great
Ordinance of thy Supper, I will in a most solemn manner think
of thee. Teach me to remember thee here with Joy, with
Pleasure, with Comfort to my Soul. Here let my Thoughts
of thee be sweet. Whenever I think on thy Cross, let me re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
how by thy Charity I was freed from the Curse of
God. Thou becamest a Curse for me: Ought not this Mercy
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:103387:89"/>
to be remembred for ever! Write it in my Mind, engrave it
upon my Heart, let this Remembrance be easie to me. Chase
away all Unwillingness, all Backwardness to this Duty, from
my Soul. Oh, let it become natural, and make this Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
profitable to me, that my Inward Man may be renewed
by it Day by Day, and abound in Love; and the longer I
live, the more conformable I may be to thee, sweet <hi>Jesu;</hi> to
whom, with the Father, and the Holy Spirit, be all Honour
and Glory, for ever, and ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>

            <head type="sub">Of the other Element or Part of this holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
viz. the Wine, and the Cup Christ made
use of in the Institution of the Eucharist.</head>
            <argument>
               <head>The CONTENTS.</head>
               <p>Red Wine, in all probability, made use of by Christ, in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
of this Sacrament: As also, Wine mixed with Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
Too great a Stress laid upon this Mixture by the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
and Eastern Churches. The Cup Christ used in this
Sacrament, pretended by the Romanists to be in their Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session.
The Cups made use of by the Ancient Churches,
what Matter or Substance they were of, examined. On the
Sacramental Cup, anciently was engraven the Figure of a
Shepherd and a Lamb. The Cup, in process of Time, chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
into Silver Pipes. Christ gave the Cup to the Disciples,
as well as the Bread, for weighty Reasons; to shew, that
the Bread and the Cup are of the same Worth; and that
those who receive the one, should receive the other also. The
Abuse of the Church of Rome, in denying the Cup to the
Laity, laid open. Their Reasons and Arguments answered.
Why Christ made use of Wine in this Sacrament, discovered
in five Particulars. The Reasons why he made use of a Cup,
and no other Vessel. An Enquiry made, why Christ took
the Cup, after he had done with the Cup in the Passover.
The Cup in this Sacrament, contrary in its Effects to Circe's
Cup among the Heathens. None fit to drink of this Cup,
but Men of Valour and Courage. This Cup very comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to all distressed Spirits. The Prayer.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>I. THough it be not very material to know what Wine
it was, Christ made use of in the Institution of
this Sacrament, what Colour it was of, or whether it
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:103387:90"/>
was pure and unmix'd; yet we have Reason to believe
that it was <hi>Red Wine,</hi> and <hi>Wine mix'd with Water. Red,</hi>
because this was the usual Wine among the <hi>Jews,</hi> and
therefore called <hi>The Blood of the Grape, Gen. 49. 11.</hi> And
when the Royal Prophet would express God's Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
upon the Wicked and Incorrigible by <hi>Wine,</hi> he
saith, <hi>The Wine is red, Psal. 75. 8.</hi> And this sort of Wine
did best represent the <hi>Blood of Christ,</hi> which was to be
spilt for the Sins of the World, and to make a consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Figure in this Sacrament. And to this purpose is
that famous Prophecy, <hi>Esay 63. 1, 2, 3. Who is this that
comes from</hi> Edom, <hi>with died Garments from</hi> Bozra? <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
art thou red in thy Apparel, and thy Garments like him
that treads in the Wine-Fat?</hi> Which Words, as, by the
Consent of Interpreters, they relate to <hi>Christ</hi>'s Death,
and bearing the Burthen of God's Anger for our Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions,
so they at once express the <hi>Blood of Christ,</hi> and
the <hi>Colour of the Wine</hi> that was most in use among the
<hi>Jews;</hi> and consequently, 'tis very likely that <hi>Christ</hi> made
use of <hi>Red Wine</hi> in this Ordinance. And as it was <hi>Red,</hi>
so it is probable it was <hi>Wine mixed with Water,</hi> this also
being customary in that Country, as we see, <hi>Prov. 9. 2.</hi>
in which our Blessed Master lived during his Abode in
the World. The Evangelists, indeed, mention no such
Thing; but, in general, only tell us, that it was the <hi>Fruit
of the Vine, Christ</hi> and his Disciples drank of: And this
sufficiently justifies the use of pure Wine in our Churches,
when the <hi>Eucharist</hi> is celebrated: And though the <hi>Jews</hi>
are very peremptory in asserting, that it was the Practice
of their Fore-fathers, in the Passover, as well as at other
Times, to mingle Water with their Wine, which is the
only Thing that makes it likely that <hi>Christ</hi> did not vary
in the Institution of this Sacrament, from the Custom of
using mix'd Wine; yet since the Book of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
we are to be governed, is silent as to this Mixture,
it follows, at least, that the Christian Churches are left
to their liberty to use either pure or mixed Wine in this
Sacrament. The <hi>Roman Church,</hi> at this Day, makes it a
piece of Religion to use Wine mingled with Water in the
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:103387:91"/>
Cup the Priest drinks of in the Celebration of the Mass.
The <hi>Eastern Churches</hi> keep up the same Custom. The
<hi>Armenian</hi> Christians heretofore used pure Wine, but they
were censured for doing so in the Sixth <hi>Council</hi> in <hi>Trullo.</hi>
And it is a very strange Uncharitableness in <hi>Theophilact,</hi>
to curse these <hi>Armenian</hi> Christians for this Omission: <hi>Let
them be confounded,</hi> saith he, <hi>because they mingle not Water
with their Wine in the Mystery of the Eucharist.</hi> The <hi>Greeks,</hi>
who are strangely superstitious, do warm their Water
before they mingle it with the Wine, thereby to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
the warm Blood and Water that flowed from <hi>Christ</hi>'s
Side after his Death: And, indeed, this was the great
Reason why the Churches of old did
use Wine and Water in this Sacrament,<note place="margin">Zonar. ad Can. 32. Conc. in Trulio.</note>
thereby to put the Congregation in
mind of that Blood and Water which ran out when the
profane Soldier ran his Spear into Christ's Side; though
some think, that the Mystery of it was to express the two
Sacraments, Christ had bequeathed to his Church and
Followers.<note place="margin">Epiphan. Haer. 46. &amp; August. Haer. 64 Philastr. Haer. 77.</note> There were a sort of <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks</hi>
in the Ancient Church, who made
use of Water only in the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> as
thinking the Use of Wine unlawful, and
an Invention of the Powers of Darkness: But the Church
condemned them, as profane; and thought them unfit
for her Communion. And yet, were it so, that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
lived in a Country, or Place, where they are in no
possibility of getting Wine, it is not to be doubted, but
that any other Liquor, which Men commonly drink,
and refresh their fainting Spirits with, may lawfully be
made use of, as a Symbol, or outward Sign of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
spiritual Grace, which we apprehend to be in the
Blood of the Ever-blessed <hi>JESUS.</hi> At this Day, in
the Churches of <hi>Aethiopia,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ludolph. Histor. Aeth. l. 3. c. 6.</note> where Wine
is scarce, the Priests, in the <hi>Eucharist,</hi>
make use of a Liquor, made of Water
and the Stones of Raisins, bruised and infused in it; and
yet, even to this Liquor they add more Water, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the Custom before-mentioned. The same Liquor
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:103387:91"/>
is used by the <hi>Cophites</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and by the Christians
of St. <hi>Thomas</hi> in the <hi>Indies.</hi> And we read of others, who,
for want of Wine, have kept a Linen Cloth by them,
dipped in Wine, and dried; and when they had Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to celebrate the <hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> have wetted that Cloth,
and made use of the Liquor thus expressed, instead of
Wine: A Custom condemned, indeed, by Pope <hi>Julius;</hi>
who, in case of Necessity, permitted a Bunch of Grapes
to be bruised, and mingled with Water. But how can
a certain Law be prescribed to People that have neither
Grapes nor Wine; as it happens in many Countries far
distant from the Sea?</p>
            <p>II. As to the <hi>Cup,</hi> out of which Christ and his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
drank the Sacramental Wine, some have been so cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
as to enquire, not only into the Matter, but also
the Form or Shape of it. The more superstitious Sort in
the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> contend, that this Cup was of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;
and not a few among them believe, at least pretend,
they have the very Cup Christ used in the first Institution
of this Sacrament: But the Mischief is, that this Cup is
to be seen in divers Places; at <hi>Rome,</hi> at <hi>Valentia,</hi> at <hi>Doway,</hi>
at <hi>Lions,</hi> and in <hi>Helvetia:</hi> So that either none of all these
Pretenders have it; or if one have the right, the rest must
be Impostures; or if all have it, it must, since that time,
be miraculously multiplied; which, I think, may as well
be believed as <hi>Transubstantiation.</hi> The Evangelists did
not think it worth while to mention any thing about it;
and whether the Cup, he used, was of Earth, or Tin, or
Silver, or Gold, or Stone, or Wood, tends not much to
Edification. St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> saith appositely, <hi>Though the
Cup the Apostles received, and drank of, was not of Gold, yet
tremendous it was, and full of Majesty and Splendour, because
it was full of the Holy Ghost.</hi> 'Tis very probable, that in
the more innocent Ages of the Church, when Simplicity
and Godly Sincerity flourished, Christians were conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with Wooden Cups, as they are at this Day in the
Church of <hi>Aethiopia:</hi> These were afterwards changed
into Glass; and as in progress of Time, Plenty, and the
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:103387:92"/>
People's Liberality increased, and the Church fell to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
the Grandeur of Courts; Cups of Silver and Gold,
and sometimes decked with Precious Stones, were made
use of: Which occasioned that witty Saying of <hi>Boniface</hi>
the Martyr, when one asked him whether it was proper
to make use of Wooden Vessels in the Sacrament; his
Reply was, <hi>Heretofore the Church had Golden Ministers, and
Wooden Chalices; but now we see Golden Chalices, and Woo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
Priests;</hi> because the Time he lived in was very bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren
of vertuous and learned Men.<note place="margin">Platin. in Zephy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin. 1.</note> We
are told by some Historians, that Pope
<hi>Zephyrinus</hi> was the first that brought in
<hi>Chalices of Glass,</hi> about the Year of our Lord, 198. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
before they had been all of Wood. And to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
St. <hi>Jerome,</hi> some time after, tells us of <hi>Exuperius,</hi>
the famous Bishop of <hi>Tholouse,</hi> that he used to carry the
Consecrated Bread in a <hi>Wicker Basket,</hi> and the Holy
Wine in <hi>a Vial of Glass;</hi> yet they began very early, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in the greater Cities, to bring in Pomp and Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur
about the Vessels used in the holy Communion;
as, at <hi>Rome, Constantinople, Alexandria,</hi> and in other weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
and populous Places; which made <hi>Julian</hi> the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state,</hi>
seeing the rich Communion-Vessels, say scoffingly,
<hi>How splendidly is the Son of</hi> Mary <hi>served?</hi> In a word,
'Tis like, as soon as the Church began to enjoy Quiet
and Ease, under <hi>Constantine</hi>'s Reign, Prosperity being
impatient of mean and plain Usages, Men began to
change the Primitive Simplicity into more stately ways
of Administration of this Sacrament: Not that there is
any hurt in using Silver or Golden Cups in this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but so much I thought sit to mention, to shew,
that as the Gospel takes notice of no such thing, as the
Matter the Cup was made of, so there is no Stress to be
laid upon it; and a peaceable Christian is, in this Case,
to follow the Usages of the Church he lives in, and to
look chiefly to the spiritual Frame of his Heart; for if
that be as it should be, it is indifferent what Matter the
Cup is made of in the Administration of this Ordinance.
As to the Figure, Form or Shape of the Cup Christ
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:103387:92"/>
made use of, Tradition saith, <hi>It was a Cup with two Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles,
holding a Quart of Wine.</hi> 'Tis true, the <hi>Jews,</hi> in
their Passover, made use of such a Measure, which was
therefore called <hi>Robiit,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </note> or a Fourth Part; and
<hi>Christ</hi> might possibly accommodate himself to
that Custom, the rather because it was a Cup that all the
Disciples drank of, according to Christ's Order, <hi>Drink
ye all of it;</hi> yet this is still conjectural only, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Christian Churches are in this Case left to their
Prudence and Discretion. <hi>Tertullian</hi> tells us, (and he
lived about the Beginning of the Third Century,) that
in his Days there was engraven on the sacred Chalice
the Figure of a Shepherd, carrying a Lamb upon his
Shoulders; an Emblem either of the Parable, <hi>Luk. 15.
4, 5.</hi> or of the Son of God, who walked through the
Wilderness of this World, to seek those which were lost;
and having found them, brought them back to the Fold
again, and to his Father's House. But see how soon an
innocent Custom draws on more dangerous Practices:
In process of time, the holy Cup in the Sacrament be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to be adorned with various Images and Inscriptions:
Such was the Cup which <hi>Remigius,</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Rhemes,</hi>
who died in the Year 535. bequeathed to his Church,
with this Inscription, <hi>Out of this Cup the People drink Life
and Happiness, through the Blood of Christ Jesus.</hi> As Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition
afterward increased, instead of Silver Cups the
People made use of, the Monks invented little Silver
Pipes, through which the People were to suck the holy
Wine out of the Cup the Priest made use of; which is
the Reason why, in the Rules of the <hi>Carthusian</hi> Monks,
this, among the rest, was one, <hi>That they shall have nothing
of Silver in their Colleges, save only a Silver Chalice, and
Silver Pipes, through which the Lay-men are to suck the Blood
of Christ.</hi> These Things are hinted here, to shew how
necessary it is to keep up to the Primitive Institution of
this Sacrament; for if once Men presume to deviate
from that Simplicity, they know not where to stop, and
they will be tempted to hancker after new Devices and
Inventions every Day.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="174" facs="tcp:103387:93"/>
III. That Christ gave the Cup to his Disciples, as well
as the Bread, is evident from the Institution. And the
Reasons were these:</p>
            <p>1. To shew, that this part of the Sacrament is of the
same worth and value with the other, and that we are
to esteem the sacred Cup as highly as we do the Bread;
for as the former represented his broken Body, so this,
his spilt and flowing Blood: Nay, if there be any Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminence
in the one above the other, it must be ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
to the Cup, or the Blood of Christ, represented by
the Wine in the Cup; for upon the Blood of the Son of
God the weight of Redemption lies, according to what
the Apostle tells us, <hi>Heb. 9. 11, 12. But Christ being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
an High-Priest of good Things to come, by a greater and
more perfect Tabernacle, not made with Hands; that is, not
of this Building, neither by the Blood of Goats and Calves,
but by his own Blood he enter'd in once into the Holy Place,
having obtained Eternal Redemption for us:</hi> And, <hi>Without
shedding of Blood, there is no Remission;</hi> as it is, <hi>Vers. 22.</hi>
And this shews how miserably the poor People are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded
in the Modern Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in that they are
denied the Cup in this Ordinance; for hereby they are
deprived of that which should afford them the greatest
Comfort, and assure them of the Remission of their Sins:
For, if the great Stress of Redemption must be laid on
the Blood of <hi>Christ,</hi> and they are deprived of that part
of the Sacrament which properly and immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presents
his Blood, which was shed for the Remission of
their Sins, it must necessarily follow, that they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerably
cheated: And what Assurance can they have
from this Sacrament, that their Sins are, or will be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned,
when they receive not that which must assure
them of it? So that the Laity in that Church are left in
a most uncomfortable Condition. Nor will it avail much
to say, that the People believe that they receive the Blood
in the Bread; for it is not Fancy or Imagination that
will do any good here. <hi>Christ,</hi> certainly, did not think
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:103387:93"/>
so, which made him appoint a distinct Symbol for his
Blood; and, but that they are not to believe their own
Senses in that Church, their Eyes and Tongues might
convince them, that they do not remember the shedding
of Christ's Blood for the Remission of their Sins, by drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Wine designed for that purpose: For,</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Christ,</hi> in giving the Cup to his Disciples, as well
as the Bread, intimated thereby, that those who received
the one, should receive the other also. This hath been
the Sense of the Christian Church for many Hundred
Years after Christ: The <hi>Greek,</hi> from the Apostles Days,
to this Hour, hath inferred, and doth infer so much;
and even the <hi>Latin</hi> Church, for above
a Thousand Years,<note place="margin">Georg Cassand. Consult Art. 22.</note> was of the same
Opinion. 'Tis true, in the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> the Priest drinks of the consecrated Cup, as well
as eats the consecrated Wafer: But what have the poor
Sheep, the Lay-men done, that they must be excluded
from the Cup? The Apostles, 'tis granted, were Priests;
but they received not the holy Sacrament as Priests, but
as Believers: <hi>Christ,</hi> at that time was the Priest that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred
the holy Symbols to them; and Children can
tell, that, according to this way of arguing, the People
ought not to receive the holy Bread, because the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
were Priests when they received it. However, to
do even an Enemy right, the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> is ingenuous
enough in their maintaining of this Sacrilege; for the
<hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Constance</hi> expresly tells us, That
<hi>though Christ gave the Sacrament to his
Disciples in both kinds,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Concil. Constant. Sess. 13.</note> 
               <hi>and though in the
Primitive Church, this Sacrament was received by the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
in both Kinds,</hi> yet notwithstanding all this, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of that <hi>Council</hi> think it fit to abrogate that Custom,
and threaten the Priest with Excommunication, that
shall offer to give the consecrated Wine or Cup to the
Common People. And, I confess, this is plain Dealing,
but in the worst Sense; as Men do justifie their Sins,
and boast of their Iniquities: And with what Conscience
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:103387:94"/>
any Person can be of that Church, that doth assert, and
defend, and obliges her Members to comply with such
manifest contrariety to the Doctrine of Christ, I know
not. This I know, that Obedience to the Precepts of
the Gospel is a commanded Duty, and they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
from Christ's Favour and Friendship, that will
not keep his Words; and all pretences of Love are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected,
as Pageantry, where obedience to his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
is not the product of that Love; and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
they can expect but little Favour of him, that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Master's Will, will not do it; and being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced,
that he hath given this general Rule, <hi>Drink ye
all of this,</hi> prefer their own Fancies, and would rather
break his Command, than either acknowledge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in an error, or return to the Truth, which they
have forsaken.</p>
            <p>IV. That which gave occasion to this Sacrilege in the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> was partly the pride of the Clergy, who
by receiving in both kinds, would needs distinguish them
selves from the Laity; partly the Asservation, or keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the consecrated Bread in some Houses, practised
by inconsiderate People in ancient times; partly the
Doctrine of <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> for the <hi>Roman Clergy</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving,
that the People would never receive this absurd
Doctrine, if they did not make them believe that in the
Wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>er they received <hi>Christ</hi>'s Blood, as well as his Body,
thereupon denied them the Cup; partly some frivolous
pretences, as, <hi>that in some places Wine could not be had,
others were abstemious, and naturally hated Wine; some had
long Beards, and might spill the Holy Wine upon them; and
some had the Palsie in their Hands, whereby they might let
the Cup fall;</hi> &amp;c. Pretences which the Primitive Church
did not so much as dream of. It is certain, that this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
is a Feast, and as any ordinary Feast would
look strange, if no drink were given to the Guests, so the
Sacrament in the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> loses the name of a
Spiritual Feast, by their denying the Cup to the Laity:
And one may justly wonder, how, in that Church,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:103387:94"/>
they can understand the <hi>6th</hi> Chapter of St. <hi>John</hi>'s Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
of the Holy Sacrament, since it is expresly added,
<hi>v. 53. Except ye drink the Blood of the Son of Man, you
have no Life in you:</hi> This very place did so much pinch
<hi>Aeneas Sylvius,</hi> who was afterwards Pope, by the name
of <hi>Pius</hi> II. that when the <hi>Bohemians</hi> and <hi>Taborites,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
the Cup in the Sacrament, upon that saying of
<hi>Christ,</hi> he had no other way to extricate himself, but by
alledging, that in that Chapter Christ did not speak of
the Sacrament at all, but only of Spiritually Eating and
Drinking, in general, <hi>viz.</hi> by Faith, or practical Belief
of his Doctrine. And this Opinion, not a few of the
<hi>Romanists</hi> are forc'd to espouse; yet the generality of
them understand it of the Sacrament, and how the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
can content themselves under such a threatning, if
that be the sense, I cannot comprehend. And though
some of them plead, that there is a difference betwixt
the Institution and a Precept; and though Christ insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
this Sacrament in both kinds, yet he did not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
it to be received in both kinds; yet who sees not
the weakness of this Exception, since <hi>Christ</hi> hath comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
us to use and administer this Sacrament, as he hath
used it, and expresly adds a Command concerning the
Cup, <hi>Drink ye all of this.</hi> And though in <hi>Luk 24. 30.
Christ</hi> is said to be known of the Disciples by his break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Bread, yet from hence it follows not, that by that
breaking of Bread is meant the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> nor if we grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that the <hi>Eucharist</hi> is to be understood there, that
therefore they had no Wine, since the whole action is
commonly expressed by breaking of Bread, as <hi>Act 2, 42.</hi>
And if this were granted, it would follow, that Christ
consecrated only in one kind, which they of the Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> themselves will not allow. But they, that from
such expressions would infer, that Bread only was used
in the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> betray their stupid ignorance of the
Customs and Expressions, used among the Jews, who
commonly called any Meal whatsoever, where all sorts
of Food and Drink were used, by the Name of <hi>break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Bread;</hi> and to <hi>break Bread</hi> with a Man, was as much
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:103387:95"/>
as to <hi>Dine</hi> or to <hi>Sup with him:</hi> And so the <hi>Grecians,</hi>
from the other part of a Meal, called it <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or
Drinking together, as the Jews call a Feast <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <hi>Mishteh,</hi> or Drinking; though Meat as well as Drink,
was set upon the Table.<note place="margin">Hist. Eccl. <hi>l.</hi> 13. <hi>C.</hi> 7.</note> What some alledge
out of <hi>Nicephorus,</hi> concerning a Woman, in
St. <hi>Chrysostom's</hi> time, infected with the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie
of <hi>Macedonius,</hi> who coming to receive the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
substituted or took common Bread, instead of
the Sacramental Bread, which thereupon, by a Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacle,
was turned into a Stone, and would infer from
thence, that the Laity, at that time, received the
Bread only, is altogether insignificant; for not to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that that Story may justly be suspected of Falshood,
since <hi>St. Chrysostome</hi> himself makes no mention of it, it's
evident from his Writings, that the Laity in his time
received the Communion in both kinds; and if such a
Miracle had been wrought before she received the Cup,
how doth it follow from thence, that none of the other
Communicants, which were present, did receive the
Cup? God might, by that Miracle, shew and discover
to her, her unworthy receiving, whereby being fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
she might be afraid of receiving the other part of
the Sacrament; yet still, that doth not make it out, that
the Communion was in those days received only in one
kind: And besides, what would the practice of a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Church signifie, if it contradicted both the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of Christ, and of all other Churches? That the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental
Bread was carried home, kept and preserved
by some in Boxes at their own Houses, which in case
of necessity or imminent danger, they made use of, we
deny not; but the practice of particular Persons is no
Law, no Prescription, and the Papists themselves will
not allow Lay-men to keep the consecrated Wafer in
their Houses, and to communicate without a Priest:
So that this practice of particular Persons, neither in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
the lawfulness of it, nor the lawfulness of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating
in one kind. The Primitive Churches were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
much against this keeping of the consecrated Bread,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:103387:95"/>
or carrying of it home; for in St. <hi>Jerom</hi>'s
after the Communion,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hierom.</hi> in 1 Cor. 2.</note> if any of the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated
Bread were left, the Communicants
divided,<note place="margin">Hist. Fccl. <hi>l.</hi> 17. <hi>c.</hi> 25.</note> and eat it up; <hi>Nicephorus</hi> assures us,
that it was the custom of the Church of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi>
for many years together, that if
after the Communion, much Bread were left, more than
the Ministers present could eat, the Boys, that were
Fasting, were called from their School, and had liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
given them to eat it up. In <hi>Hesycheus</hi>'s
time,<note place="margin">Hesych. <hi>in</hi> Levit. 18.</note> it was customary, if after the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
any Bread remained, to burn it,
And in the Council of <hi>Caesar Augusta,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Can. 3.</note> about the
Year of <hi>Christ 513.</hi> it was decreed, that if any
did not eat all the Bread in the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> that was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
him, but did carry it home, he should stand Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
for ever. So that, whatever the practice of
some particular persons was, the Church, we see, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested
against it, and abrogated it, partly because there
was no example for this keeping of the Bread at home,
in the Gospel, partly because it might, as afterward it
did, give occasion to many Superstitions, as indeed the
asservation of the consecrated Waser in the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> at this day, is nothing else; for they keep it in
Boxes or Chests, that they may carry it about, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
the Adoration of it in the Circumgestation; and
when any great Fire, or Wind, or Tempest happens,
this is pretended to have great Virtue, either to lessen
or avert those evils. It is pleaded commonly, that the
Laity may, with greater convenience, receive only in
one kind, and with as much profit to, as if they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in both; but that this is false, appears from hence,</p>
            <p>1. Because nothing can be convenient for the Laity,
that is against Christ's Institution and Command; and
as the Bread is to lead them to the contemplation of
Christ's Crucified Body, so the Cup is to direct them to
fix their Thoughts on the Blood he spilt for them. And
if this way of reasoning were just, why should it not be
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:103387:96"/>
as convenient for the Priest to receive in one kind, as
for the Laity?</p>
            <p>2. Because the Profit that is to be received by the
Communion, must be received in that method and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that Christ hath thought fit to dispense it; and since
Christ thought it most proper, that this Profit should
be received by communicating in both kinds, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
Profit contrary to Christ's design and intention, is
to deceive our selves. Some of the <hi>Papists</hi> themselves
grant, and it was asserted by several in the <hi>Council of
Trent,</hi> That greater Grace and Comfort was to be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by Communion in both kinds, than by Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in one only; and there were some of the Primitive
Fathers, that thought that the Bread extended its Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
to the Body only, but the Wine to the Soul; and
if this were to be allow'd of, the Laity, in the Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> must be either supposed to have no Souls, or
that their Souls receive no Profit by the Sacrament, since
they are denied the Wine. But however, if Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
in one kind be so profitable for the Laity, why
should it not be as profitable for the Clergy?</p>
            <p>V. Why Christ made use of Wine in the Institution
of this Sacrament, several Reasons may be given: As,</p>
            <p>1. One great property of <hi>Wine</hi> is, to <hi>give Man a chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
countenance, and to make glad the Heart,</hi> Psal. 104. 15.
And surely this was to let us see, what joy our Souls are
to express at the remembrance of God's Compassion
and Charity; a joy, which will appear very rational,
if we frame right apprehensions of our natural condition;
for, let me take a view of the state of my Soul abstract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
from Christ's mediation and God's Love; I shall
appear to my self a creature forsaken of God, destitute
of Mercy, deprived of hopes of Pardon, an object of
Wrath, a scorn of Angels, the sport of Devils, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion
of Reprobates, a prey to ravenous Birds, an heir
of the burning Lake, a subject of Damnation, a slave
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:103387:96"/>
to the worst of Masters, hated by Heaven, condemned
by mine own Conscience, and in a worse condition
than the Beasts that perish; and let me suppose that I
were surrounded by Wolves and Lions, in a barren
Wilderness, Vipers and Serpents crawling about my
heels, every moment in danger of being torn to pieces,
and in danger of a cruel, lingring, and barbarous death;
and in these sad circumstances, should some kind Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer
leap from behind a Thicket, or come riding to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
from afar, to rescue me from this impendent ruin,
how should I rejoyce at the unexpected and unlook'd
for Providence! My case, by nature, is much worse;
for wild Beasts may devour me, and make an end of
my pain: but here I find my self beset with hellish furies,
so far from being willing to make an end of my life and
pain together, that they seem resolved to increase it dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
and no Angel, no <hi>Lazarus,</hi> no Messenger out of
the Clouds, vouchsafes a drop of Water; and therefore,
in so deplorable an estate, to see the Son of God sprig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in, and flying to my rescue, and crying, <hi>I will heal thy
backslidings,</hi> and unto my Enemies round about me, <hi>O
death, I will be thy Plague, O grave, I will be thy destruction;</hi>
what joy, what gladness, what comfort must this cause!</p>
            <p>2. By <hi>Wine</hi> he represented the everlasting joys, he
intended to purchase for his followers, by his bitter death
and passion; he himself gives us a hint of this, <hi>Matth. 26.
29. I will not drink henceforth of the fruit of this Vine, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
the day that I drink it new with you in my Father's king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi>
i. e. Of this material Wine, I shall, after this,
drink no more in your company; but when you are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
to the Joys and Glories of my Father's Kingdom,
then I'll Drink and Feast with you again; and the Wine,
I will then give you to drink of, shall be new Wine, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
different from this Wine, which shall have
others effects, and other operations: <hi>Wine,</hi> which the dull
World is a stranger to; <hi>Wine,</hi> which Glut<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ons and Drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards
shall never taste of; <hi>Wine,</hi> that shall fill your Souls
with the purest Joy's with Delights, purely Spiritual and
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:103387:97"/>
Celestial; so that these everlasting Joys may be called
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Wine fulfilled,</hi> as St. <hi>Luke</hi> speaks of the
<hi>Bread, Luke 22. 16.</hi> And then the Wine may be said to
be compleated and fulfilled, when that, which is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
by it, is actually fulfilled and conferred on the
person, who are counted worthy of it. The Joys above,
are the Wine of Angels; this Wine is the clear vision of
God, or the Glorious sight of the Fountain of Light
and Beatitude; this inebriates their Understandings, ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigates
the Spirits of Men made perfect, makes them
drunk with Joy, and their Reason is lost in Raptures and
Extasies; and therefore justly styled <hi>Joy, which Eye hath
not seen, and Ear hath not heard, and Heart cannot conceive:</hi>
The Souls of Men, it seems, are channels too narrow
to hold those joys; they over-run the Banks; and as
the flame of a Candle is lost in the brighter Sun-shine,
so the Divine Light in Heaven shining upon Souls, they
are, as it were, lost in that Glorious splendor.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Wine</hi> is the Emblem of <hi>Wisdom</hi> too; so much we
may guess from what we read, <hi>Prov. 9. 1, 5. Wisdom
hath built her a bouse, she hath hewen out her seven Pillars,
she hath kill'd her Beasts, she hath mingled her Wine, she cries
Come eat of my Bread, and drink of the Wine that I have
mingled:</hi> So that we have reason to conclude, that our
Saviour in using Wine in this Sacrament, would express
the necessity of a vigorous application of our Minds to
spiritual Wisdom, even to that Wisdom which drives out
sensuality, expels the Wisdom of the Flesh, despises the
Wisdom of the World, and values Christian simplicity
above all <hi>words which human Wisdom teaches;</hi> Wisdom
which seems folly in the eyes of the World, but is really
an effect of the Spirit of Wisdom and Understanding;
<hi>Wisdom,</hi> which concludes, <hi>If Christ hath done for me, what
the Scripture saith he hath, laid down his life, spilt his blood,
sacrificed himself, given himself a ransom for me, a mercy
without which I could neither have been safe nor happy, and a
share in which must needs be more to me, than the wealth of
Kings: What can be more reasonable than that he should be my
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:103387:97"/>
Master, and I his Servant, that he should command, and I
obey, that he should govern, and I submit; that he should
prescribe Laws, and I act according to those Laws, whatever
Danger, whatever Trouble, whatever Inconvenience I put my
self to.</hi> This is the Wisdom of God, or rather infused
by God into the Soul; and if any sort of wisdom were
hinted by Christ's using Wine in this Ordinance, it must
be this Wisdom; for this is gratitude and ingenuity, and
an argument, that we receive not the grace of God in
vain.</p>
            <p>4. Wine <hi>hath briskness and spirit in it, and might not
this be an</hi> Item <hi>to tell us, how lively and vigorous our
Love should be to Christ Jesus? and how like new Wine,
our Love should be ready to burst the bottles, at least
vent it self in some such ejaculations? Oh Jesu,</hi> how
sweet, how lovely. how amiable art thou, how full of Beauty,
how full of Glory, how full of Majesty in the midst of all thy
pain and sorrow! Thy wounds look dismal, yet was never
any thing more medicinal, never did any thing afford greater
virtue; for they can cure sin, they are preservatives from
Hell, and the surest Amulets against inffection; from these
the costly Balsom flows, that must restore my wounded Soul!
Oh how I love thee! Oh how I prize thee! Oh how I esteem
thee! Thou art more to me than Father or Mother, more than
Lands or Houses: I read of Fountains that flow'd with Oyl,
when thou wast born, but that's no comfort to me; Thy wounds
are the springs that send forth an Oyl precious and sweet,
and odoriferous, whereby the diseases of my Heart are expell'd;
This is the Oyl of gladness, anoint my Head with it, and
from thence let it run down to the skirts of my cloathing,
that my whole Man may be thine, and my Soul and Body,
and all I have, may participate of thy grace and compassion!</p>
            <p>5. <hi>Wine</hi> is cleansing too, and might not this be an
hint of the purifying quality of the Blood of the Holy
Jesus? Surely that Blood cleanses us from all sins it wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
whiter than Snow, Fullers-Earth is not to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd
with it. Though the Sinner wash himself with
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:103387:98"/>
Nitre, and take much Soap, to purifie his Soul, yet
that will not take away one spot, still his iniquity will be
mark'd before God; but the Blood of Christ will make
him clean, so clean, that God will spy no iniquity in
<hi>Jacob,</hi> and no perverseness in <hi>Israel;</hi> so clean, that no
wrinkle shall appear in him; one would think nothing
could have been more filthy than some sinners have been,
yet upon their Repentance, the Blood of Christ hath so
purified, so cleans'd, so beautified their Souls, that even
Angels have fall'n in love with them.</p>
            <p>VI. That Christ made use of a Cup in the distributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Wine, we have already taken notice of; but
whether there might not be some mystery in his making
use of a Cup, and no other Vessel, is a thing worth our
consideration. And.</p>
            <p>1. The Prophets had spoken of a Cup of trembling,
and of a Cup of God's fury, <hi>Es. 51. 17. Jerem. 25. 15,
17, 18.</hi> This Cup the Jewish Nation was to drink of,
their Commonwealth and Policy was to be destroy'd,
and inexpressible Calamities were to light on them; and
the second Captivity was to be worse than the first, as
their Sins that caused the second, were greater than those
which occasioned the first; Miseries so great, that when
Christ beheld the City, he wept over it, and said, <hi>The
days will come upon thee, that thine enemies shall cast a trench
about thee, and compass thee round, and keep thee in on every
side, and shall lay thee even with the ground, and thy chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
within thee, and they shall not leave in thee one stone up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
another, because thou knewest not the time of thy visitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
Luk. 19. 41, 43, 44. This was the Cup of astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that unhappy Nation was to drink of, so that his
making use of a Cup, was an allusion to that misery;
for now the time drew near, and they were going to
do that, which would hasten their ruin, <hi>viz.</hi> kill the Lord
of Glory, and their greatest Friend.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="185" facs="tcp:103387:98"/>
2. Himself was to drink the Cup of the Lord's fury,
to atone for the Sins both of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and of
this, the Cup he took was an Emblem. He had gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously
and freely undertaken to open to Mankind a way
to God's Favour. This way could not be made, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
the Decree of God, but by his Sufferings; and
and accordingly we find him drinking so deep of this
Cup, that in the Garden of <hi>Gethsemane, he falls into an
Agony, and his Sweat was, as it were, great drops of
Blood falling to the ground,</hi> Luk. 22. 44. That which made
this Cup so bitter, was the greatness of the sins of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
and the dreadful wrath of God they had deserv'd,
particularly the monstrous sins of the Jewish Nation, to
whom the first offers of Grace were made, and the
unspeakable temporal calamities which were to come
upon them for their perfidiousness, and contempt of
the greatest mercies, and their total desolation and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,
for their hardness and wilful stupidity. These,
as they were represented to his Mind in a lively manner,
so it caused prodigious Grief in his Soul, insomuch that
he profess'd his <hi>Soul was sorrowful unto death;</hi> This was a
Cup, the most loathsome that ever mortal did take, and
therefore he calls it by that name, <hi>Father, if it be possible, let
this Cup pass from me,</hi> Luke 22. 42. He takes therefore a
Cup here, that his Followers in future ages might think
of the Cup he had drunk of, with so much terror and
consternation.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Cup he took,</hi> to let us see, that the Cup he took in
this Sacrament, was the true <hi>Cup of Salvation:</hi> we find
mention made of a <hi>Cup of Salvation,</hi> and of a <hi>Cup of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation,</hi>
Psal. 116. 13. and Jer. 16. 7. But the Cup in this
Sacrament is of a far greater virtue. The Cup of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
among the Jews, was either the Cup of Wine
they made use of in the Passover, or the Cup they drank
of at Festivals or Feasts, when they rejoyced with their
Friends, after some signal Mercy and Deliverance. The
Cup of Consolation was properly that, which they gave
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:103387:99"/>
to Mourners at Funerals, especially where People took
on excessively for the death of their near Relations, or
were ready to sink with Grief; But the Cup in this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
is a Cup of Salvation and Consolation in a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limer
Sense. By the Blood of Christ, Mankind was
made capable of inheriting Life and Eternal Salvation,
which is beyond being saved from <hi>Egypt,</hi> from the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dianites,</hi>
from the <hi>Assyrians,</hi> and from the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> so
that he that drinks of this Blood contain'd in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Cup, and drinks like a thirsty Man, with a thirst
after Righteousness, drinks Salvation, drinks everlasting
Mercy, drinks to the content and satisfaction of his
Soul, and <hi>out of his belly shall flow fountains of living wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi>
i. e streams of Grace and Goodness shall flow
from his Heart, to the watering and enriching of those
that are round about him, <hi>John 7. 38.</hi> And this must
needs make it a Cup of Consolation; for what greater
comfort can there be, than to drink the rich draught of
Pardon, of Peace, and Mercy, and Joy in the Holy
Ghost, as every Soul is supposed to do, that comes to
this Ordinance, with unfeigned Resolutions to have her
conversation in Heaven.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>A Cup he took,</hi> to put us in mind how necessary
God's Goodness, Favour and Providence is to us, for
this was expressed in the Law, by making God the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their Cup, as we see, <hi>Psal. 16. 5. The Lord is the
Portion of my Inheritance, and of my Cup;</hi> a phrase much
used among the Jews of the devouter sort, when they
would declare, not only their interest in God's special
Providence, but the necessity of having a Right and Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
to it. A Cup is a necessary Utensil in a Family
and there is scarce any person so poor and needy, as to,
want a Cup; so hereby they expressed both the absolute
necessity of having a special interest in God's Love,
and the possibility the poorest body was in, to arrive to
this Priviledge. A Man may be happy without Lands
and Houses, and happy without an Estate, without Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and Mother, without Children, without a Prince's
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:103387:99"/>
Favour; but he cannot be happy without an interest
in God's Gracious inclinations and Complacency. Even
an Idolatrous <hi>Laban, Gen. 31. 30.</hi> was in some measure
sensible of this Truth; for when <hi>Rachel</hi> had stollen her
Father's Images, he seem'd to be much concern'd for
them; <hi>If thou wouldst needs be gone, wherefore hast thou
stollen my gods?</hi> As if he had said, I could have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
with thy taking away my Daughters, my Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>children,
my Cattle, and my Sheep; but to steal my
gods, than which nothing is more dear, or more neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to me, this I cannot brook. A Cup therefore Christ
made use of in this Sacrament, to tell us of what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment
it is to have God for our Friend; and if he
be our Portion, we need no more; if he be the portion
of our Cup, we have Wealth and Bliss enough, and may
defie all the Powers of Hell, who in this case may assault,
but cannot prevail against us. Indeed if <hi>Christ</hi> be ours,
and will vouchsafe to intercede for us, we are more than
Conquerors. <hi>O Jesu; Thou art our All, our Crown, our
Glory; if thou be for us, we need not fear who is against us!
Let thy Wounds be ours, and our wounded Spirits will be at
rest: O tell us, that thine Agonies are ours, and we will tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph
over death, and sing,</hi> O Death where is thy Sting!
O Grave where is thy Victory.</p>
            <p>5. <hi>A Cup he took,</hi> to bid us mind what he had so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
told the Pharisees, and to hint to us, that, whenever
we see this Cup in the Sacrament, we ought to ask our
Hearts, whether we make clean <hi>the inside of the Cup and
Platter;</hi> as the expression is <hi>Matth. 23. 27. i. e.</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we purifie our inward Man, our Souls and Spirits,
from those covetous, disorderly, unclean Desires,
Thoughts and Imaginations, which are so apt to harbor
there. True Religion is no outside business, but must
be rooted in us, and a Sense of the Love of God, must
be riveted into our Spirits, that there, God may become
truly amiable to us, and what we feel within, may force,
as it were, the outward Man into a suitable Fruitfulness.
Most Mens Religion, like their Cloaths, adorns only the
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:103387:100"/>
ovtward Man, and saying their Prayers, going to Church,
and doing such little things as are no trouble to their
Lusts, or sinful Appetite, are the principal Ingredients
of their Divinity; but this is not the Light, which Christ's
Religion gives, for that strikes the Understanding,
works upon the Will, and puts all that is within us into
Fermentation; This cleanses the Heart from filthiness,
the Thoughts from vanity, the Mind from prejudice, the
Affections from love of the World, from malice, hatred,
and supercilious contempt of our Neighbors, and the
desires from revenge and greediness after the Shells and
Husks of outward Comforts; so that true Religion is a
new Principle, which produces a new Creature, and
newness of Life, <hi>2 Cor. 5 17.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. And why may not we piously believe, that his <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
use of a Cup,</hi> was also to encourage our Charity and
Hospitality, expressed sometimes by <hi>giving a Cup of
cold water to a Disciple, in the name of a Disciple,</hi> Matth.
10. 42. He that knows any thing of this Holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
knows, it is a Feast of Charity, a Feast, at which
we remember our Spiritual Poverty, and lying at the
Gate of Heaven, fuller of Sores, than the famous Beggar
before the Palace of <hi>Dives;</hi> and can the undeserved, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected,
and inexpressible Charity of God to our Souls,
shine in our Faces, and not warm our Hearts, and Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els
into compassion, and commiseration to the poor and
needy, such especially as are of the Houshold of Faith?
If we are so low in the world, and Providence hath put
us in so mean a condition, that we can give no more
than a Cup of cold water, and do but run to the next
Well or River, and fill the Cup, and bring it to a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress'd
and fainting Christian, a good Man, and a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciple
of our Lord, even that shall be interpreted favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably,
and God will find out a recompence for it; a
recompence, which shall make the Giver sensible, that it
was for that Cup he gave, that he receives that Mercy;
provided still, that this Charity proceeds from a sense of
the Love of God, and tenderness to the necessities of
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:103387:100"/>
the Humble Man. This consideration one would think
should be baulked by none that comes to the Lord's
Table, where the Lame, and Blind, and Maim'd are
entertain'd; for such abasing Thoughts of our selves, we
are to entertain here; and if so, How easie, how na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
is the Inference? <hi>If so miserable a Creature as I, am
feasted here, and God gives Bread of Life to my hungry Soul,
How can I express my Gratitude better than by casting my
Bread upon the Water, especially when I am promis'd to find
it again after many days, floating on the Rivers of Pleasure,
which are at the Right Hand of God for evermore.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>VII. Both the <hi>Evangelists</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> taking notice,
that <hi>Christ</hi> took this Cup after he had done with the
Cup in the celebration of the Passover, we must not
pass it by without making some Remarks upon it. And,</p>
            <p>1. It was to teach us <hi>Order in our Duties,</hi> and to avoid
confusion in our Holy performances. God is the God
of Order, and 'tis fit, his Servants should resemble him
in this particular, Greater Duties must ever be preferr'd
before the lesser, and Mercy many times comes to be
a greater Duty than Sacrifice. Ordinarily a Duty of
God's Worship, we have resolved upon, ought to be
preferr'd before a Duty of Civility; and a customary
visit is not to dash or hinder our intended Devotion.
God must first be pleas'd, and then Man, in things law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and convenient; yet Charity is of so great a value
in the sight of God, that many times he bids us prefer
that before Devotion. When my Neighbors House is
on fire, I am bound to run, and endeavour to quench
that, though the hour is come, that I use to enter into
my Closet to pray to my Father in secret; and my sick
Neighbor wanting my help and assistance, I may just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
prefer a charitable Visit before my accustomed Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lications.
Nor is this all the Order, that is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
in Duties; The business of our calling must be
begun with Prayer, and concluded with Thanksgiving;
and he that, when first he awakes in the Morning, lets
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:103387:101"/>
his first Thoughts be of God, and when he is up and
dress'd, applies himself to singing of a Psalm, or to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditating
in the Law of God, by reading a Chapter in
the Bible with attention, then kneels down to Prayer,
either by himself, or with his Family, and afterwards
goes to his lawful employment, and in the midst of
that imployment forgets not, that God sees and hears
him, but runs up often with his Thoughts to Heaven,
takes notice of God's Providences, and before he goes
into company, arms himself with Holy Ejaculations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Sin, and Infection, and at night reviews what he
hath been doing in the day-time, such a person acts or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly,
and draws a Blessing down upon the work of
his hands, not to mention the Peace, he thereby pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures
to his Mind, and Conscience.</p>
            <p>2. He took <hi>this Cup</hi> after the Paschal Cup, to shew,
that after the Jewish Oeconomy, another, and much
nobler Dispensation was to follow, a Dispensation not
of Shadows and Types, and Images, but of Truth, of
Reality, and Accomplishment; a Dispensation not
requiring Sacrifices of Lambs and Bullocks, but such as
press'd Spiritual Sacrifices and Oblations; a Dispensation
not of Bondage and Slavery, but of Freedom and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
a Dispensation, which should be large and diffussve,
not confining its Priviledges and Influences to a single
Nation, but spread them abroad to the comfort of all
the Inhabitants of the World. None drank of the Cup
of the Passover, but persons circumcised; but the Cup
Christ takes here, all Nations, both circumcised, and
uncircumcised, were permitted to participate of; all
Penitents, what Kindred, People, Tongue, or Nation
soever they were of.</p>
            <p>3. He took <hi>this Cup</hi> after the Paschal Cup, to shew
there was greater Virtue and Excellency in this last, than
there was in the first. After me comes a Man, saith the
<hi>Baptist, John 1. 30. that is preferr'd before me, for he was
before me.</hi> So it may be said of the <hi>Paschal Cup,</hi> after
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:103387:101"/>
that, came a Cup, which was far more Excellent and
Glorious, and Beneficial, than the other. <hi>Christ</hi> came
after <hi>Moses,</hi> after the Law, after the Prophets, yet went
beyond them all in Light, in Knowledge, in Virtue, in
Goodness, and in bringing glad Tidings; And so the
Passover, tho' it was before the Lord's Supper, yet doth
this Supper of the Lord transcend the other by many
degrees, and both represents and confers sublimer Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
than the roasted Lamb could do; for here the Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Trinity manifests it self, in greater charms than it
did in the Baptism of the Lord Jesus, in which <hi>St. John</hi>
saw the Heavens open, and the Holy Ghost descending
on the Son of God in the shape of a Dove, and the
Father compleating the stupendious Scene with an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation,
<hi>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well-pleased;</hi>
For in this Sacrament the Holy Ghost falls on
the Souls of sincere Believers, as Rain on the Mowen
Grass, and as the Showers that water the Earth; The
everlasting Father not only tells us, which is the Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
Son, but by setting his Sons death before us, shews
that he loved us, in a manner better than his Son, in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
that Son to dye for us, than which nothing can be
more kind, nothing more surprizing; the Son himself
invites us, and offers to wash us from our sins with his
own Blood, and assures us, That being sprinkled with
his Blood, we are fafe and secure against all the Curses
of the Law, and the Thunders of Mount <hi>Sina.</hi> These
things were Mysteries and Paradoxes in the Passover;
but this Sacrament which came after it, opens the door,
and lets us in, to see this Glorious Representation, and
consequently is a Richer, Greater, Holier, Sublimer,
and more Heavenly Ordinance, than the Passover.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <pb n="192" facs="tcp:103387:102"/>
               <head>The Preeeding Considerations reduced to Practice.</head>
               <p>I. AMong the Heathen Poets there is much talk of
<hi>Circe</hi>'s Cup, which transform'd Men into Brutes
and Swine, a Fable whereby they represented, how sen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sual
pleasure transform'd Men into Creatures void of
Reason and Discretion. But the Cup we speak of hath
contrary effects, and Fire and Water are not more op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite,
than the operations of these two; For this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Cup transforms Brutes into Men again, and
changes Beasts into the Image of the Son of God. Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
make but a trial of it, thou, I mean, that hast not
had so much understanding as the Swallow, and the
Turtle, and the Crane, for they know their appointed
times; whereas thou hast not known the time of thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn;
thou that hast rusht into Sin, as the Horse rushes
into the Battle; thou that hast wallowed in the Mire
with the Swine, and acted like a Creature made of Earth
and Dung. Take courage prepare thy self for drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of this Cup; purifie thy Soul, for profane Hands
must not touch it; confess thine iniquity, make War
with thy Lusts, Fight with thy carnal Desires, and drink
of this Cup, and thou wilt find how thy Reason will
clear up, how thy Understanding will be enlighten'd,
how thy beastly Qualities will die; The Blood in this
Cup hath such Virtue in it, that it will transform thee
by the renewing of the Mind, and make thee prove
what is the Holy, Perfect, and acceptable Will of God.
It's true, the bare drinking will not do it, but drinking it
with Contrition, with contemplation of the Person,
whose Blood is in the Cup, with consideration of the
Cause, <hi>viz.</hi> the Sins that spilt it, with thankfulness for
the infinite Mercy of him, that thus freely parted with
it, and with resolutions to love him, that did not think
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:103387:102"/>
his own Blood too dear to let it flow for the
good of his enemies.<note place="margin">Petrus de Natalibus, <hi>l.</hi> 5. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>Petrus de Natalibus</hi> tells
us of a Woman, who, having labour'd many
years under very great infirmities of Body
was brought exceeding weak, but drinking one day ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally
out of the Cup, that a Holy Man <hi>Scion</hi> by
Name, did use to drink of, she was restored to perfect
health; Though we cannot promise, that this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Cup will work such a Miracle of the Diseases
of the Body, yet surely it will transform a Soul, sick to
death, into a lively and healthful constitution; though,
with the Woman in the Gospel, she hath lain under
her distemper, a considerable time.</p>
               <p>II. Among the <hi>Scythyans,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Herodot. l. 4.</note> as <hi>Herodotus</hi> tells
us there was a custom for the Princes of the
Country to meet once a year, at a certain Feast where
a Cup was set upon the Table, a <hi>Cup of Honour,</hi> which
none durst presume to drink of, but such as had signa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liz'd
their Valour in Battel, and kill'd more or less of
their publick Enemies. Though this Sacramental Cup is
too High, too Sacred, and too Lofty a thing, to be
compared with Cups, used at the Feast of <hi>Barbarians;</hi>
yet I may take occasion from hence to tell you, that this
Holy Cup is fit for none to drink of, but such as have
either shewn, or are at least resolved to shew their Valour
against their Spiritual Enemies. Christian, if thou hast
fought with the Old Serpent, encountred the Hellish
Dragon, wrestled with Powers and Principalities, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest
thy Courage against Temptations, defied <hi>Goliah,</hi>
the Lion and the Bear, the World, the Devil, and the
Flesh; or art resolv'd to be a Champion for thy God,
and fight the Battels of the Lord; Thou art that vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
Man, that may drink of this Cup: Thy God will
give thee leave to drink of it with other Hero's, with
the greatest Worthies, with Men, of whom the World
was not worthy, with Men, whose Faith hath advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
them above the Stars, and who are to shine as the
Sun in the Firmament, in their Father's Kingdom. Let
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:103387:103"/>
no despairing Thoughts, no suggestion of the Devil,
no slavish Fear, no pretence of Unworthiness, discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
thee from touching this Cup, or drinking of it.
It's mingled for thee, for thee it is prepared; The King
expects thee at this Feast, thou art called to this Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet.
Thus shall it be done to the Man, whom the
King of Heaven intends to Honour. What? If thou
hast not slain thy Thousands with <hi>Saul,</hi> nor thy Ten
thousands with <hi>David?</hi> What if thou hast not brought
thy Two hundred Foreskins of the <hi>Philistins</hi> to thy Lord
and Master, thou dost a greater act in conquering thy
Thoughts, thy Desires, thy Passions, thy Appetite, thy
vain Imaginations, than if thou hadst laid Countries
waste, ruin'd Kingdoms, or bound their Kings in Chains,
and their Nobles with Fetters of Iron. Such <hi>Honour
have all all his Saints.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>III. Hear this, thou fainting Soul! that groanest un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the burthen of thy Sins, goest heavy laden with
Sorrow, and like <hi>Rachel,</hi> wilt not be comforted. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
thy Lord and Master touched with the feeling of
thy infirmities, and afflicted in all thy afflictions, who
waits to be Gracious, and loves to converse more with
a weeping Publican, than with a jovial <hi>Herod,</hi> he reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
forth a Cup to thee, a Cup of Joy, a Cup of Glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
a Cup of Comfort. It is this Sacramental Cup.
Drink of it, thou thirsty Soul, Why shouldst thou fear?
This Cup is design'd for labouring Souls; they that have
born the heat and burthen of the day are to taste of it.
It is design'd to recreate, design'd to refresh, desing'd to
revive, design'd to support their Spirits: Dost thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
this, Christian? Dare to believe it: Take thy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours
word for it, and triumph in the Promise. The
Mercy may be too big for thee to ask, but not too big
for him to grant. Thou hast a Master to deal withal,
who gives like himself, like a King, like a Prince, whose
Stores are inexhaustible! Let no <hi>Senacharib</hi> deceive thee,
regard not what such a <hi>Rabshakeh</hi> says, Hearken not to
the frightful Stories of thine enemies, who rejoyce to
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:103387:103"/>
see thee discourag'd, are glad to see thee forbear drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of this Cup, and think it their interest to keep thee
from that, which may, and will, give thee everlasting
health. I have read of a precious Stone, of considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
value, that dropt, no Man knew how, into the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Cup, while the Priest was administring the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
There needs no precious Stone to drop into this
Cup, to make it of greater value; That which is in it,
is of greater worth than Ten thousand Worlds; It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presents
that which neither Pearls, nor Rubies, nor Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds,
can counter-balance. The Papists boast much
of the Gifts of their Popes, how <hi>Sylvester</hi> gave three
Golden Cups to be used in the celebration of the <hi>Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist;</hi>
How <hi>John</hi> the Second gave a Cup of Gold weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Twenty pound; How <hi>Gregory</hi> the Second, and <hi>Leo</hi>
the Third presented their respective Churches with
Cups, all beset with precious Stones; What if thou canst
bring no such Presents to God, thou bringest a better
when thou bringest a Spirit, a Heart, a Soul lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and mourning, because thou hast departed from him,
contented thy self with a form of Godliness, and under
the profession of Religion, hast denied him in thy acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
A Heart toucht with the sense of the unreason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness,
odiousness, and loathsomness of all this, and
finding a relish in the things of God, and of Salvation,
qualifies a Man more for comfortable drinking of this
Cup, than if, with the Wise Man, he had offer'd Gold
and Myrrh, and Frankincense to <hi>Christ Jesus. Is not
this the Cup whereby my Lord divineth,</hi> saith <hi>Joseph</hi>'s Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard,
<hi>Gen. 44. 5. Christian,</hi> by drinking of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Cup, thou may'st divine thy future happiness,
guess at what will become of thee hereafter; make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures
of thy Glory, and conclude, that thou shalt
feel the comfort of drinking the Cordials of a Blessed
Eternity.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>O</hi> Jesu! Great Fountain of all Goodness! who didst
drink of the bitter Cup which my Sins had mingled!
I am sensible there was no sorrow like thy sorrow, which was
done unto thee, and wherewith the Lord afflicted thee in the
day of his fierce anger. How was thy Spirit disturb'd! How
sore amaz'd was thy Soul! How dismay'd thy Mind! To
such an exceeding heighth of Grief and Sorrow, did the Sense
of the incumbent load of my sins, and the prospect of calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
hanging over my head, together with the reflexion on my
wretched condition, skrew up thy Affections! innumerable evils
encompass'd thee, thou sawest the wrath of God flaming out
against my Sin, and trembledst! Thou stoodst before the
mouth of Hell which I had deserv'd, and wast astonish'd!
Thou with thine own Heart Blood didst quench the wrath of
Heaven! O how am I obliged to adore thy Love! O everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
Father! What Charity was it not to spare thine own
Son, but to deliver him up for us all! What pity and compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
was it, O thou Eternal Son of God, thus to pour forth
thy Blood! What Affection, what tenderness to my Soul, O
thou Eternal Spirit, hast thou express'd in inspiring my Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Redeemer, with Charity more than Human; and in sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting
him to undergo all pressures with invincible patience!
<hi>If I forget thy Love, sweet Jesu, let my right hand for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
her cunning!</hi> What an encouragement is here to believe
thy Word, which I see so punctually accomplish'd! The anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Prophets foretold that Christ should suffer, and so it came
to pass! Let me for ever believe thy promises: In all Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
in all Troubles, in all Necessities, let thy Promises be
for my Comfort! Let me never mistrust thy Goodness, after
so great an instance of thy Goodness, as the Gift of thy Son
must be! How can I despair of Mercy, upon unfeigned Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
when, in this passion, Mercy was drawn out to that
length on purpose, that it might reach the greatest Sinners.
<hi>O Jesu!</hi> thou hast defeated all mine Enemies! Thou hast eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuated
all the obstacles of my Salvation! Let me pretend and
plead excuses no more. Now let me run with patience the
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:103387:104"/>
race, which is set before me, the way being open'd into the
Holy of Holies, encourage me to walk in it, with all that
wait for the Salvation of God. Affect my Heart with a
Religious Fear, and let thy humble Passion kill my Pride!
Let my Sins appear more dreadful to me, when I contemplate
thine Agonies; and let the World with all its deceitful Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
become loathsome to me, when I see how little thou didst
regard it. Let every thing die in me, that is not agreeable
to thy Life, that when thou, who art my Life, shalt appear,
I may also appear with thee in Glory. <hi>Amen. Amen.</hi>

               <head>The CONTENTS.</head>
               <p>A seeming contradiction betwixt the Evangelists, reconcil'd.
The Greek Word, which we render Testament, prov'd
to signifie a Covenant too. The manner of making Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants
in ancient times, applied to the Covenant made
in this Sacrament. The difference between the Old and
New Covenant, discover'd. In this Sacramental Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
the parties mutually engaging one to another, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to be God and Man. Under what Notions both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
are to be consider'd, explain'd. The nature of this
Sacramental Covenant, its beginning, and first rudiments
in our Baptism, the necessity of renewing it, when we
come to some maturity of Understanding. Our consent to
it, and how that consent must be qualified. This Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
if broken, after a due ratification of it, whether it
may be renew'd. What things do not break or null it. What
Sins they are, that make it void. How it may be renew'd
by sincere Repentance, and what kind of Repentance it
must be. Great presumption to enter into a Solemn Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
with God, and not to consider the wieght and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
of it. The great misery and wretchedness of Men,
who are not actually in Covenant with God. How neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
it is for persons, when young, to make or renew their
Covenant. No impossible thing to come to a rational Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
that we are in Covenant with God. The Mercies
and Advantages of being God's faithful Confederates.

            <p>
               <pb n="199" facs="tcp:103387:105"/>
I. CHrist in describing the Nature of this Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Cup, or the Wine in the Cup, tells us, as
<hi>St. Matthew</hi> and <hi>St. Mark</hi> relate it, <hi>This is my Blood
of the New Testament,</hi> or as <hi>St. Luke</hi> and <hi>St. Paul</hi> rehearse
it, <hi>This Cup is the New Testament in my Blood. St. Luke
being</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s companion in Travel, it's like the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
made use of <hi>St. Luke</hi>'s Commentaries, which he had
by him, though perhaps they were not yet published to
the World, nor must we therefore suspect a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
in these different expressions; for the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists,
in their Histories, do not always tye themselves
to the very number and order of Words and Syllables,
which our Saviour spoke, but many times think it suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to express the Sense; and that the Sense is the
same here, though the Expression be different, will
easily appear to an impartial Reader, though it may be
said, that <hi>Christ</hi> might very justly use both expressions,
one after another, say that, which <hi>St. Mark,</hi> and <hi>St.
Matthew</hi> mention, and afterwards that which St. <hi>Luke</hi>
and St, <hi>Paul</hi> take notice of, by way of explication; and
for brevitys sake, one Evangelist might set down one;
and another, the Sense being the same, another.</p>
            <p>II. The word which we render <hi>Testament,</hi> is in the
Original <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which indeed in some few places of
Scripture, particularly <hi>Hebr. 9. 15.</hi> is us'd for the last
Will and Testament of a Testator, but for the most
part stands for a <hi>Covenant,</hi> answering to the <hi>Hebrew</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Berith,</hi> and imports a compact, or contract of
two Parties, mutually engaging to one another, to do
and perform what is proper, convenient, and fit to be
done, and this by the consent of all Interpreters, is the
chief signification intended here; and that which will
give Light to this Notion, is the custom of the first
Ages of the World. For Covenants in antient times
were usually made by the slaying of a Beast, and shed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
its Blood, which was to put the Confederates in
mind, that if they broke the Articles agreed upon, they
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:103387:106"/>
must fear as base a death, as that Beast did suffer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and
Providence would not only take notice of the violation,
and revenge it, but by the ceremony they imprecated
themselves, that in case they prov'd false to their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
such a sudden violent death might seize on them.
Among the more barbarous sort of Mankind, when in
these cases they had slain the Beast, they pour'd the
Bloud of the Hog, or Calf, or Ox, that was shed, into
a Cup, and the Confederates drank of it, to make the
tye stronger, and the execration more dreadful, and
consequently more forcing. But the civiller sort, after
they had kill'd the Beast, to seal the Covenant, instead
of Blood, fill'd the Cup with Wine, and the respective
Parties drank of it, which they thought, and believ'd, to
be as obligatory, as the other; In a word, hereby both
parties express'd their resolution and serious intent to
perform the mutual Engagements, and tacitly wished
Death, and Judgment to themselves, in case of nonper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of the Articles: And though this cannot be
applied in every circumstance to the Covenant made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
God and Man in every particular, God not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
capable of imprecating himself, and his Word be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of greater weight and moment, than all the Oaths
and Execrations Man can take, yet from the premises
we may easily guess, that Christ alludes to these practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of Mankind, in saying, <hi>This is my Blood of the New
Testament;</hi> and that in this Sacrament Men enter into
a Covenant with God, or rather confirm the Covenant
made betwixt God and them, by the Mediation of the
Blood of <hi>Jesus,</hi> who was the innocent Lamb slain from
the foundation of the World; for it is with regard to
that Blood, that God is not only willing to enter, but actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
enters into compacts, and contracts with lapsed
Man, and as in the afore-mentioned federate Rites and
Ceremonies, the parties engaging to one another drank
of the Blood of the slain Beast, or of the Wine, which
was in lieu of that Blood, thereby to confirm their mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
promises; so they that come to this Holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
are not only admonish'd by drinking of the Cup,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:103387:106"/>
or of the Wine in the Cup, representing the Blood of
Christ, to enter into solemn Engagements and Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
to be true and faithful to that God, who bought
them at so dear a price, as the Blood and Death of his
own Son; but in actual drinking of it, profess and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare,
that in case they prove false and treacherous to
their great Confederate, break their promise wilfully,
and allow themselves in it, that they deserve that ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
Death and Damnation, from which that Blood
was intended to deliver them; and besides, it is a tacit
imprecation too, if they be not true to their Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
that then those Agonies, and Miseries, and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Death, the Son of God endured, shall fall to their
share and portion, which illustrates the Apostles saying,
<hi>1 Cor. 11. 29. He that Eats and Drinks unworthily, Eats
and Drinks Damnation to himself:</hi> But of this I shall have
occasion to Treat professedly in the sequel.</p>
            <p>III. There is frequent mention made in Scripture of
the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Covenant.</hi> By the <hi>Old</hi> is meant the
Covenant or Compact, God by the Ministry of <hi>Moses</hi>
made with the Israelites, as they were a Common-wealth,
whereof God himself was pleas'd to be the
King and President. This Covenant was fitted to the
slavish temper of the People, God had to deal withal;
and as God promised them temporal Felicity, eating
the Good of the Land, a plentiful Harvest, increase of
their Kine and Cattle, full Barns, and a rich Vintage,
multitude of Children, and protection from their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
Enemies, so it requir'd in the Consederates, or
Jewish People, an exact compliance of their outward
Man with the Precepts, Laws and Statutes God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
and gave them. The <hi>New Covenant</hi> is that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
which God makes with Mankind in <hi>Christ Jesus,</hi>
wherein he promises to admit sincere Believers into his
special Favour, and, for Christ's sake, to bestow upon
them the riches of Grace and Glory, and on our side
requires renouncing all Love to a sinful Life, and resig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of our Souls, Spirits and Bodies, to his Will and
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:103387:107"/>
Government. It's call'd New, in opposition to the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
or Political Covenant, God made with the Jewish
People, as they were a Nation, immediately under his
Jurisdiction; for both the Promises and Obedience under
that Dispensation, were different from the Promises and
Obedience of the other, one promising only Temporal
Blessings, and requiring External Obedience; the other
promising Spiritual and Eternal Blessings, and requiring
Internal, and sincere Obedience; and though the New
Covenant, which God makes with the People under
the Gospel, had its beginning already in <hi>Adam</hi>'s time,
immediately after the Fall, and was again publish'd in
the days of <hi>Abraham:</hi> Yet notwithstanding all this, it
may justly be call'd New, because of the clear and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
Revelation of it, when <hi>Christ</hi> the foundation of it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd,
and by his Death confirm'd all the Predictions,
Prophecies, Types and Prefigurations of it, before and
under the Law of <hi>Moses;</hi> for then was made a new
publication of it, new Witnesses were made use of, and
new Motives and Encouragements were given, and
new Sacraments as Seals of that Covenant were added.
And this New Covenant, the Blood or Wine, the
Embleme of it, in the Holy Sacrament of the Lord's
Supper, relates to; and he that drinks of that Wine or
Blood, represented by it, confirms that Covenant, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses
that he approves of it, will stand to it, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges
the justness of his threatnings denounced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
those, who count this Blood of the Covenant an
unholy thing. Even the Civil and Political <hi>Covenant</hi>
which God made with the People of the Jews, was so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnized
by Blood. which is the reason of that passage,
<hi>Exod. 24. 7, 8. And Moses took the Book of the Covenant,
and read it in the audience of the People; and they said, All
that the Lord hath said will we do. And Moses took the
Blood, and sprinkled it on the People, and said, Behold the
Blood of the Covenant, which the Lord hath made with you,
concerning all these words.</hi> And as in their suffering themselves
to be sprinkled with that Blood, they declared their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned
assent, and consent to the conditions of that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:103387:107"/>
and profess'd that it was just with God to inflict
death and ruine upon them, if they did not study to
obey that Covenant; so in the New Testament, in this
Holy Sacrament, those that come to be Partakers of it,
are sprinkled, as it were, with the invaluable Blood of
Christ, and by that, own their hearty consent to the
Conditions of the New Covenant, and ratifie their Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
and God's Promises and Threatnings too, which
are the Sanctions of this Covenant.</p>
            <p>IV. In this Covenant, the Parties concern'd are <hi>God</hi>
and <hi>Man;</hi> yet from hence no Person is to conclude,
that God stood in need of this Alliance. We indeed
had need of it, and it was our Interest, that God should
do so. His vouchsafing to come to such a Contract,
speaks his Goodness, and there is not a greater Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his Clemency and Compassion: He could have
been Great, Glorious and Magnificent without us, and
what need had he of the Friendship of such miserable
Creatures, as we are, that was All in All? His Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
and Beatitude receive no addition by this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant;
and what had it been to him, if we had been left
in the common mass of Corruption and Perdition?
What could he have lost by our Eternal Groans, or
what disparagement could it have been to him to let us
sink into the Gulph, when our Sins and Offences were
the meritorious cause of it? It shews his infinite Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and condescention, that he will enter into promises
and engagements with his Creatures; and we are Brutes,
if the thoughts of his Mercy, in this particular, do not
force our Tongues to break forth into admiration of it.
Our Misery and Wretchedness required such a favour,
and without it we must have been as great strangers to
happiness, as we were to power and ablility to help
our selves. Commisseration to our Poverty and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done
Condition, moved the Almighty to come to terms
with us, and this Covenant is our advantage and emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lument.
God gets no profit by it, and though it is a
publication of his Goodness, and proclaims the Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:103387:108"/>
of his Loving-kindness, yet God might have found
out other ways to manifest that; and it's we, that are
the Gainers by this Contract.</p>
            <p>V. In this Covenant, God must not be considered
only, as an infinite, most perfect, and most excellent
Being; but more particularly under that threefold Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation

               </gap>, <hi>Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy-Ghost.</hi> Man also, is
not only to be looked upon as Gods Creature, but as a
<hi>Sinner</hi> fallen from God, apostatiz'd from Righteousness,
and standing in need of Gods Help, Assistance, Grace
and Reconciliation, and as one, who, of a Child of
Wrath, is to be made a Child of God; of an Enemy,
a Friend; of an Heir of Hell, an Heir of Heaven, and
Co-heir with <hi>Christ:</hi> And accordingly, this Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Covenant is nothing else but a mutual Promise, of
an offended God, and the offender, whereby both
Parties do unfeignedly, and without guile, or fraud, or
equivocation, declare themselves, willing, ready, and
resolved to perform the things agreed upon; God, what
he promises; and Man, what he engages to do. For
God, consider'd as the <hi>Father Everlasting,</hi> promises here
to treat us as his Children, to be tender of our Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
and Eternal Welfare, to seek our good, and turn all
things to our good; to pass by the Unkindnesses, and
Indignities, we have offer'd to him, to forgive, and
throw them into the depth of the Sea, to impute them
no more, to count us innocent, to justifie us here, and,
like a Father, to provide an Eternal Inheritance for us,
<hi>i. e.</hi> to glorifie us for ever. <hi>The Son of God,</hi> consider'd
not only as the <hi>Eternal Wisdom</hi> of the Father, but as <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator
and Redeemer of the World,</hi> promises to be our
Intercessor and Advocate, with his Righteousness to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
our Infirmities, with his Wounds to cherish our
Souls, to answer all the Arguments and Objections of
the Devil against us, and to be our Friend, our Brother,
our Shepherd. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nd our <hi>New</hi> and <hi>Living Way</hi> to his
Father's Bosom. The <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> doth promise to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten
us, to be our Guide in the dark, to comfort us
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:103387:108"/>
in all our Tribulations, to teach us how to pray, to
assure us of God's love, to fill us with joy in believing,
to increase our Graces, to strengthen us in all Difficulties,
to support us in our Spiritual Dangers, to arm us with
Arguments against Temptations, and to give us a Right
to a future happy Resurrection. This is the mighty
promise God makes to poor Sinners in the Sacrament:
On the other side, we that come to the Table of our
Lord, and do not intend to come in vain, do solemnly
promise, particularly to the <hi>Eternal Father,</hi> that we will
own that relation with joy, and walk as his Children,
not fashioning our selves according to our former Lusts
in our ignorance, but be holy, as he, that hath call'd
us, is holy; that we will no longer live like Rebels and
Prodigals under the Name of Children, but make good
that Glorious Title by our Lives, shine as Lights in the
World, and endeavour to be spotless and blameless, and
by our Lives, and Actions, and good Works, glorifie
our Father which is in Heaven. We promise here to
<hi>God the Son,</hi> and the <hi>Great Redeemer,</hi> that we will not only
accept of his purchas'd Blessings, but submit to his Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
too, and that he shall be not only our Saviour, but
our Sovereign King and Master also, to whom we will
think our selves obliged to submit in all things, that he
shall say unto us in his Gospel; that his Life shall be
the pattern of ours, and his Example and Command
shall do more with us than our Gain, or Appetite, or
Interest; that we will be loyal to him, who redeem'd
our Lives from Destruction, and will act as Spiritnal
Subjects in his Spiritual Kingdom. We promise also to
<hi>God the Holy Ghost,</hi> That we will not only expect his
Benefit and Comforts, but be guided by his Motions;
That we will not re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>st his Checks and Reproofs, but
hearken to them, whenever our Hearts do smite us;
That we will not prefer the Dictates of a Lying Devil
before his Lively Oracles, nor joyn with the Motions
of our F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>esh against his Intreaties and Obtestations:
That we will make much of his gracious Visits, and take
heed we do not by our Sins and Follies, defile the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:103387:109"/>
of the Holy Ghost: That we will cherish his kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Influences, and take care, that the Grace, and
Talent he confers upon us, be not buried in the Earth,
or laid up useless in a Napkin. And this is a <hi>Scheme</hi> of
the solemn Covenant, a Believer, a Receiver, a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municant
enters into, with the <hi>Holy Trinity,</hi> in this Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendous
Sacrament; a Covenant that ought to be more
sacred than the Leagues of Princes, and more religiously
observed than the Treaties and Engagements of the
dearest Friends.</p>
            <p>VI. This <hi>Covenant</hi> we enter into, first of all in our
<hi>Baptism,</hi> when our Age is Tender, our Desires Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
and our Souls, like soft Wax, fit for any Impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and consequently fit for the Impress of the Divine
Image; and though that Age be not capable of enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
actually into a Covenant with the Lord of Heaven
and Earth; yet it's enough that our Parents and Friends,
who have Power over us, do then make this Covenant
with God for us, dedicate us to his Service, appoint us
Candidates of Holiness, and consecrate us early to the
performance of the Conditions, required in this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant;
a Charity just, and a genuine effect of Paternal
Care, which as it loves, the Child should share in their
Temporal Enjoyments, so it cannot but desire, it should
participate of the Blessings of this Covenant; And
since these Blessings are not to be had without the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of Faith, Repentance and Obedience, though
the Child cannot actually exercise these Virtues, yet
being offer'd to God upon these Conditions, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
do not only shew their good Will, to have the
Child enrol'd in the Book of Life, but lay the strongest
Obligations on the Child, to stand to the Terms of the
Covenant, when it comes to display the Glory of its
Rational Faculties; and therefore may expect an actual
Conveyance of the Spiritual Blessings of this Covenant
to the Child by the secret Operations of the Holy Ghost;
which Blessings the Child hath a Right to, till enticed
by Lust, and the Vanity of the World, it grows proud,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:103387:109"/>
rebellious, and shakes of the conduct of its Guide, <hi>viz.</hi>
The Spirit of the <hi>Holy Jesus:</hi> For, God knows, the
World and the Devil watch the first rising of the Sun,
I mean, the first Appearances of Reason, and seek to
obscure and darken them by Mists of Sensuality, into
which Pit the Young Man, that was in his Infancy dedicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to God, too often falls, and there lies and sleeps,
and many times awakes not, till Death summons him to
the dreadful Bar of Heaven. Where it is so, that the
Covenant, we enter'd into in the Morning of our Days,
is forgotten, slighted, and polluted with Filthiness, and
superfluity of Naughtiness, what can we think, but that
the intended Blessings of the Covenant cease and die,
and are withdrawn from the degenerate Creature, and
the Promises of God being our <hi>Father,</hi> our <hi>Saviour,</hi> and
our <hi>Comforter,</hi> are null'd, at least the performance of
them suspended, till the Apostate comes to himself again?
This early perfidiousness, too common, and too gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
discovers the absolute necessity of renewing this
Covenant, when we are able to understand the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and importance of the Contract, and to enter into
that Bond in our own Persons, especially, in the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
of the Lord, and there solemnly to engage our
Souls, to the performance of the Conditions, required
on our side, upon which, what God hath graciously
promis'd will effectually be perform'd again: an offer,
not to be slighted, for it is an argument of infinite Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and Goodness, that God will give the Backslider
leave to enter into the broken Covenant, and will, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that return, let the still streams of his Promises flow
in, and Water his Soul again; so that, if this opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
be neglected, we know not the Treasures of Wrath
we heap up against our selves, for it looks like resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to die, and to be miserable.</p>
            <p>VII. That God consents to this Covenant unfeigned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
we need not doubt; and that what he promises, he
intends to fulfil, we may be confident of, since we have
his Word for it, and his Nature is such, that he cannot
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:103387:110"/>
lye. The great danger lies on our side, who are very
mutable Creatures, and apt either to equivocate in our
consent, or to consent only by halves, or to forget the
Terms we have consented to. It's fit therefore, I should
explain the Nature of that consent we give, or are to
give, in this Covenant, especially at the Table of our
Lord; where the Sacred Cup, fill'd with the Blood of
Christ, at once represents Gods willingness to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a Covenant with us, and invites us to accept of the
Offer; and our Drinking of it shews, we actually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to all the Terms of this Covenant. Therefore to
prevent Hypocrisie in this consent, I must tell you, that
this consent must be,</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Deliberate,</hi> and the effect of Consultation. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
a melancholy Humour seizes upon our Spirits, and
not knowing how to ease our selves, we try whether Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
will not qualifie our trouble, and then we are
consenting to this Covenant, though we cannot tell why,
or how; whence it comes to pass, that if Religion doth
not presently cure our Melancholy, we grow weary,
and throw it off again. Most Men have sometimes a
Religious Fit upon them; and when either something
hath cross'd their designs, or a disaster hath put them
into discontent, they are, during that Paroxysm, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd
to consent: But as it was a sudden Motion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a good Foundation, so it soon withers and comes
to nothing It's necessary therefore, we should take
pains to understand, what this Covenant means, what
consent God requires, how reasonable and just that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
is, what a priviledge it is, that God will admit us
into such a Compact, what the things are, he requires
on our part, and how necessary it is, he should require
such at our Hands: and after we have counted the cost,
and seen, and thought, and consulted, what this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned
consent will stand us in, and weigh'd both the
Advantages, and Inconveniencies, then, in the Name
of our Lord Jesus Christ, freely and chearfully to agree
to the Conditions requir'd in this Covenant, this is a
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:103387:110"/>
consent, which, in imitation of the great Planet of the
Day, is like to go on to a perfect Day.</p>
            <p>2. This consent must be <hi>hearty,</hi> the intent strong, and
the desire vigorous to perform the Conditions of this
Covenant; such a consent as he gives, that for a consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
Reward, promises to do, what we put him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
He fully designs it, he knows nothing that should
hinder him, his Heart, his Mind, his Affections are
bent upon the doing of it; for the Reward presses upon
his Understanding, and the greatness of that gives force
and resolution to his Will and Desire. Here must be
used no underhand dealings. God is not to be put off with
Complements: The Young Man, that said, <hi>I go, Sir,
but went not,</hi> Math. 21. 28. stands branded for a Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite.
A full purpose of Heart is requisite in this case;
as serious a purpose as Men have, when under great
hopes or fears, which are most likely to make their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
invincible. To consent to walk as Sons of God,
to embrace the Lord Jesus as our King, to prefer the
Motions of Gods Spirit before the Suggestions of the
Flesh; I say, to consent to all this, and not to intend
very seriously to act accordingly, is to impose upon God,
at least to act, as if we would do so, and to slight his
Omniscience, or to carry our selves, as if he did not
know our down-sitting, and our up-rising, or did not
understand our Thoughts afar off, which is impious.</p>
            <p>3. This consent ought to be <hi>impartial</hi> and entire, even
to all the parts of the Conditions, express'd or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
in this Covenant: Here must be no accepting of
<hi>Christ</hi> by halves, but our Affections must embrace him
both as a <hi>Ruler,</hi> and a <hi>Friend:</hi> To accept of the <hi>Sweets</hi>
of his Sufferings, and to refuse his <hi>Yoak;</hi> to rejoyce in
his <hi>Mercies,</hi> and to reject his <hi>Law;</hi> or to be willing to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to some of his Laws, and to take liberty as to others,
is, to divide Christ, and to part his Offices, or to hold
both with Christ, and with the Devil. A King had as
good have no Subjects, as disobedient Subjects; and to
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:103387:111"/>
what purpose had all that costly Method of the Son of
God, to purchase a People to himself, been, if the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
had not been to make them subject to his Will and
Power? That there might be no dispute about this point,
the Apostle hath left it upon record<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Heb. 5. 9.</hi> That <hi>he
became the Author of Eternal Salvation, to them that obey
him;</hi> And there needs no great <hi>Logick,</hi> to infer from
hence, That no Man hath a Right or Title to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
till he actually and sincerely obeys him, and obeys
him in all that he requires: For he that obeys partially,
doth not obey in a Scripture sense. We our selves do
not much affect Servants, that are only for what they
can get, and care not how little Work they do; and
God, to be sure, hath no Reason to look upon those as
true Confederates, that consent only to be made hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
by the Death of Christ, but are loath to die to the
Vanities of this World, or to admit his Kingdom and
Empire into their Souls: So that he, that truly consents
to this Covenant, must consent not only to enjoy the
Comforts of a Saviour, but that Christ shall be Master
of his Will, Desires and Affections, that these shall be
at his Beck, move by his Order, and be manag'd ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his Direction.</p>
            <p>4. This consent must not only respect our future Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riousness
and Conscientiousness, but <hi>express our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Designs and Inclinations.</hi> As in Marriage, so in this
Covenant, it must be a present consent that ratifies the
Contract; and as in the former, <hi>I take thee for my Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Wife;</hi> and <hi>I take thee for my Wedded Husband,</hi> makes
the Matrimonial Compact valid, so in this, present
agreeing to the Terms propos'd and required, makes
a Man a welcome Confederate, and unites, and knits
him to that God, who enters into solemn Engagements
in this Covenant, to discharge the Offices of a kind
Husband to us; And, <hi>O God, the Father of Heaven, I
do here most humbly offer and tender unto thee my filial Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:
O God the Son, Redeemer of the World, I am content
to be thy Loyal Sabject,</hi> and <hi>to be governed and ruled by thy
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:103387:111"/>
Holy Laws: O God the Holy Ghost, preceeding from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and the Son, I take thee for my Guide, and my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellor,
by whose advice I mean to steer my course.</hi> Such pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Declarations of our consent admit us to the Bless<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of this Covenant; so that he who enters into this
Covenant, and is not willing presently, and without
delay to discharge the Conditions of it, uses Tergiver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations,
and equivocates with God; and though a Man
may intend, that some time hereafter; when he is
freer from Business, more clear in the World, hath fewer
Divertisements, and is more at leasure, he will not fail
to perform all that is required of his part, yet that will
not satisfie, nor answer the design of this Agreement;
for who knows, what he shall do hereafter? The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
time is only in our Power, and he that is not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
resolv'd, is not likely, considering the Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
he may meet withal, to do any great matters for
God, or for his Soul, hereafter.</p>
            <p>5. This content must be <hi>absolute,</hi> or, which is all one,
<hi>without Reserves.</hi> Secret Conditions have no place here.
And that Man is not fit for the <hi>Kingdom of God,</hi> that
desires <hi>first to bury his Father, or to take his leave of his
Friends and Relations, and then to follow Christ,</hi> Luke 9.
59. To consent to this Covenant, and to reserve any
one darling Sin; to consent to the performance of the
Conditions, with exception of a single Lust, which our
Place, Calling, or present Circumstances will not let
us part withal, is a sign, the Heart is not upright with
God, and a Man that hath not that high esteem of God's
Grace and Favour, he ought to have. The Soul must
come naked to the Cross of Jesus. Here must be no
Bargainings with a Tremendous Majesty, no Proviso's
<hi>as Pharaoh</hi> made with the Children of <hi>Israel,</hi> when he
was to let them go. He was content, the elder People
should march and sacrifice to their God, but the little
Ones he would have staid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God must not be told in
this Covenant, <hi>Lord! If thou wilt, let me enjoy this piece
of Pride, or give me leave to vindicate my Honour, by
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:103387:112"/>
avenging my self; If thou wilt let me comply with such a
sinful Mans humour, wilt let me flatter him, or dissemble
with him for my Profit and Interest? or if I thrive and
prosper in my Trade, Profession aud Imployment; if I may
enjoy temporal Felicity, and live as happily as my Neighbours,
I freely consent to all the rest, that thy Power and greatness
expects at my Hands.</hi> For this is to contradict the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of this Covenant, which is to make us entirely
his. And that no Man may stroak himself with a Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
that he never made, and never intends such formal
exceptions in his consent, I must add, that where a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
doth actually reserve such things, whether he doth
formally and expresly except them or no, the case is
the same, and is as much, as if such formal exceptions
had been made in our entring into this Covenant;
whatever our lot or fortune may be in the World, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
inconveniencies may happen in the strict observance
of this contract, those must be overlook'd for the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
benefits offer'd us on God's part in this Covenant.</p>
            <p>VIII. But here a question will arise, <hi>If this Covenant
be broken, after it is thus ratified, or establish'd in the Lord</hi>'s
<hi>Supper, whether, and how it may be renew'd?</hi> To give a
satisfactory answer to this point, I shall lay down what
is fit to be said to it, in these following particulars.</p>
            <p>1. By <hi>Breaking this Covenant,</hi> I mean, to make it null,
not only on our side, but also on God's part, so that
we can have no assurance, no hope, no rational con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence,
that God loves us any longer as his Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates,
as his Friends and Children, or with a love of
complacency, or that he is our reconciled Father, or
that we are dear to him, and Heirs of Heaven, or
that the Promises of the Gospel belong to us; in a word,
so to make it void, as to put our selves in the same
condition, we were in, before ever we had any thoughts
of giving our selves up to Almighty God in a formal
Covenant, so as to become objects of God's Wrath and
Indignation, to whom is reserv'd the blackness of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
for ever. This being premised.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="213" facs="tcp:103387:112"/>
2. Every thing, that clouds or darkens the comforts
arising from a sense of our being in Covenant with God,
cannot, must not, presently be interpreted, a total breach
of it; There are many sincere <hi>Christian Israelites</hi> indeed,
in whom there is no considerable guile, who either
through weakness of understanding, or through some
bodily distemper seizing on their nobler parts, or for
want of consulting with some conscientious Divine, or
through vehement assaults of the Devil, may not feel
the streams of consolation, which formerly used to flow
into their Souls from the chearful apprehensions they
had of their being united to God by a solemn Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
who yet still go on to fulfil the conditions of this
Holy Contract, and are exceeding cautious of offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or acting against the Laws of it: and most certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Mists and Fogs, which obscure and dull the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of their comforts, are no arguments of their hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
made void this Covenant, or that God's Paternal
affection to their Souls is gone: For though they may
even complain with <hi>Zion,</hi> that <hi>the Lord hath forsaken
them, and their God hath forgotten them,</hi> yet still they are
Children of Light in the midst of Darkness; and were
but the noise of temptation over, or the distemper,
which discomposes them, abated, they would soon hear
God speaking to them in the Language of a Father,
<hi>Can a Woman forget her sucking Child, that she should not
have Compassion on the Fruit of h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r Womb? Yea, they may
forget, yet will not I forget thee: Behold, I have engraven
thee on the Palms of my Hands.</hi> Es. 49. 15.</p>
            <p>3. No <hi>unallowed of Miscarriages,</hi> I mean, <hi>Miscarriages</hi>
against the settled bent and resolutions of our Souls,
can be said to null this Covenant: For God promising
in this Covenant, to be a tender and gracious Father
to us in <hi>Christ Jesus,</hi> we must needs suppose, that as a
Father pities his own Children, so the Lord takes pity
on them that fear him, as we read, <hi>Ps. 103. 13.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
as a Father, who hath an obedient Son, if he
hear him speak a rash word, or see him do an impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:103387:113"/>
act, he was never guilty of before, and perceives
him blushing, as soon as he hath done it, which shews
the Error was not in his Nature, or the effect of an
evil Habit, but caused by some accident, or before he
was aware, and consequently doth not thereupon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
cast him off, or turn him out of Doors, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
the affections and inclinations of a Father from
him; so neither doth God from his dear Confederates,
if sometimes by surprize they are overtaken in a fault,
upon which their Hearts immediately smite them, and
they take shame to themselves; for this shews, that it
was not temper, but temptation, that caused this fall,
and that it was against the bent and settled inclinations
of their Souls.</p>
            <p>4. Neither do <hi>blasphemous Suggestions</hi> null this sacred
Covenant: By these, I mean not wilful Blasphemies,
or reviling of God, the effects of Malice, Hatred and
Enmity against God, of aversion from Goodness, and
inveterate Wickedness in the Soul; for these are Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
of a Mans being in Covenant with the Devil,
and at Agreement with Hell: But by Blasphemous Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestions
are understood here, sudden Representations
of things horrid, monstrous and unnatural to our Minds,
which savour of Blasphemy, come in unforeseen and
unlook'd for, and look indeed like our own Thoughts,
but are not, but, in good truth, are Injections of the
Devil, who shoots and darts such dismal things into our
Understandings or Imaginations, contrary to our Will,
Desire, Liking, and Approbation. Of these tedious
and troublesome Guests, not a few Persons do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain,
who with great seriousness apply themselves to
the real practice of Godliness. The Enemy of Souls,
being no longer able to sooth them up in carnal securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and finding them weary of the Yoak of Sin, betakes
himself to this Stratagem, and tries by such Suggestions
and Assaults to drive them to despair; for they are things
dreadful, and such, as both Nature and Grace, and
Conscience, tremble at; and very strange effects they
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:103387:113"/>
have in many Christians, that are ignorant of these de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices;
They make them rise from Prayer, assault them
at the very Altar, disturb their warmest Devotions, and
many times tempt them to Self-Murther; and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
frequently thinks, that a Hell is begun in his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som,
that he is possess'd, and hath a Legion with him.
They come in, like Lightning, and cause such confusion
in the Thoughts, that the tempted Christian thinks
none so miserable as himself. These Suggestions, while
they are resisted, detested, opposed, slighted, abhorr'd,
and protested against, do not null this Covenant, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they are things we cannot help, nor doth it lie in
our power to hinder the Devil from trying Experiments
and Conclusions upon us: All we have to do, is, not
to consent, or not to yield to them, and thereby we
establish the Covenant. Nor,</p>
            <p>5. Doth want of such a degree, either of joy or sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
null this comfortable Covenant. There are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
sincere Believers, who either, because they cannot
weep so much for their Offences, as <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi>
and <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> or cannot raise their Affections
to that pitch of Life, and Joy, and Briskness, that
other Constitutions can in things Devotional and Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual,
are apt to conclude they have no share in the
Comforts of this Covenant: And the Argument they
commonly make use of, to prove the inference, is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause,
did God love them, as his Children, he would
give them the same spiritual Blessings, he gives to others.
But this consequence is weak, for though God doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
and give, to all Children Grace, and his Holy
Spirit, and inclines their Hearts to his Testimonies, and
whoever are of the number of true Children of God,
we may confidently affirm, they have the Love of God
shed abroad in their Souls; yet God hath no where
promis'd, that all his Children shall have the same de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of Grace; much less the same degrees of Joy and
Sorrow: For as <hi>there is one Glory of the Sun, another of the
Moon, and another Glory of the Stars; and one Star differs
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:103387:114"/>
from another Star in Glory,</hi> to use the Apostles expression,
<hi>1 Cor. 15. 41.</hi> so also is it in the Resurrection of the Soul
from the Death of Sin, all are made partakers of the
Grace of God, but all have not the same degrees of
Grace, and the degrees of spiritual Joy and Sorrow dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
too.</p>
            <p>1. Because God hereby encourages, and would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage,
the Industry of his Children. Greater de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of Grace are rewards of the industrious, and the
laborious have these baits laid before them. God Crowns
the pains of his fervent Lovers with these Laurels, and
the harder a Soul works in the Lord's Vineyard, the
higher they are advanced in this spiritual Kingdom, as
we may guess from the Parable of the Talents, <hi>Matth.
25, 20, 21.</hi> And of this the very Heathens were sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
when they made it a standing Maxim, That <hi>the
Gods sold all their Gifts for Labour and Industry;</hi> Not to
mention, that some Vessels are more capacious, and will
hold more than others, and the larger the Soul is, the
more it will contain.</p>
            <p>2. That all have not the same degrees of Joy and
Sorrow, the reason is, because God gives not to all his
Children Constitutions alike, upon which, the external
expressions of Joy and Sorrow do very much depend.
If Grace meets with a moist constitution, or affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Temper, it makes the Eyes flow in stronger cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
and fills those Chanels with larger streams of
Tears, which a more even Temper is not capable of
So, if it mingle with a sanguine and chearful complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
the Joys in spiritual things must necessarily rise
higher, than in Persons of a heavy or Melancholy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution.
Grace doth not alter the constitution, but
directs it. It gives not a new habit of Body, but dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
the habit, it finds, to exhert and vent it self in
matters of Religion, suitably to its Nature. Should all
arrive to the same degrees of Joy and Sorrow, God
must be at the charge of a Miracle every day, for he
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:103387:114"/>
would be obliged to alter the several constitutions, which
as he doth not think fit to do, so neither is it reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Men should expect it; and from hence it's evident,
that a Believer may sincerely fulfil the conditions of this
Covenant, and yet want the same degrees of Joy and
Sorrow he sees in others, and consequently this want
doth not null the Covenant.</p>
            <p>6. All Sins allow'd of do certainly null this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
whether they be great or small; By Sins allow'd
of, I mean, not only Sins committed deliberately against
knowledge, and the dictates of Conscience, but Sins
also, we live, or go on in, without remorse or a ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
care to be rid of them, and that such Sins as seem
inconsiderable in the Eyes of the World, these as well
as those of a larger size, if allow'd of, do null this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
is manifest, <hi>partly from hence,</hi> because they put
the Soul into a State of enmity against God, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
destroys the relation between <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Child,</hi> for
to be wilful in doing that, which I know, or may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
know will displease my Father, is pure rebellion, not
the error of a Child, a <hi>spot</hi> of a <hi>Leopard,</hi> not that of
a <hi>Son of God; partly, hecause</hi> these little Sins, dandled
and allowed of, are expresly said to exclude from the
Kingdom of Heaven, or, which is all one, to make a
Man least in the Kingdom of Heaven, which Kingdom
is the great Blessing promis'd in this Covenant, for so
we read, <hi>Matth. 5. 19. Whosoever therefore shall break one
of these least Commandments, and shall teach Men so, either</hi>
by word, or by his Example, <hi>he shall be called the least in
the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> And the reason, why even Sins,
which People make nothing of, such as calling their
Neighbours, Rogue and Fool, without a just cause, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scivious
desires and appetites, and revenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
actions,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>See</hi> The Happy Ascet. Exerc. 6.</note> 
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> have so severe a Sanction
annexed to them, if they be cherished and
lov'd, is this, because the less they are, the sooner, and
the more easily they are avoided, and therefore it must
argue strange aversion from God, not to oblige him in
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:103387:115"/>
so small a thing; and that Men, after they have enter'd
into this solemn Covenant at the Table of the Lord, may
be allur'd, and enticed by Temptations, and perswaded
to allow themselves in known Sins both great and small,
and thereby null the Covenant, we have no reason to
question, since Experience is beyond all Witnesses in
the World.</p>
            <p>7. The only Plank left us, after the Covenant is thus
broken and null'd, to swim out of the Gulph of perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and to regain God's favour, is confess'd on all hands,
to be true and deep repentance, and particularly a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
attended with Fasting, Alms and great fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Self-denials. In the <hi>stricter Ages</hi> of Christianity,
especially in the Second and Third Centuries, it was
very much question'd, whether a Person, who had
solemnly and deliberately entr'd into a Covenant with
God, either in Baptism<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or in the Lord's Supper, if af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
he fell into some of these three Sins, Adultery,
Murther or Idolatry, was capable of regaining the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of God, promis'd in this Covenant: The <hi>African Churches,</hi>
especially, were very stiff in this point, yet the
more moderate allow'd of a Second Repentance, rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning
the first to be that, which had been made by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dult
Persons in either of these Sacraments, and the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
if after a new fall, or wilful precipitation into
any of these crimes, he rose again with very great pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
and resolutions; but if a Man fell again into any
of these Sins, after the Second Repentance, they look'd
upon the Third as impossible. Others, though they did
not exclude the Persons, thus fallen, totally from the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility
of God's favour and Salvation, in case he repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
either the Second or third time, yet, did not think
fit to receive him again into the Communion of the
Church; and this, which the <hi>African Fathers</hi> look'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
only, as a thing convenient, <hi>Novatus</hi> enrag'd, it's
like, because he could not be made a Bishop, improved
into absolute necessity, which made his followers exclude
all such Persons, as were fallen after their first Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:103387:115"/>
into any of these Sins, from their Communion.
That which gave occasion to this Doctrine, was their
too rigid interpretation of some places in Scripture, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
that of <hi>Heb. 6. 4, 5, 6.</hi> and the other <hi>1 Joh. 5. 16.</hi>
which places are to be understood rather of a malicious
denying the Faith, and forsaking the very Profession of
Christianity, and turning Jew, Heathen or Infidel, than of
the aforesaid acts of Sin; The <hi>Roman</hi> Church was the
first that receiv'd such sinners, after a tedious and labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Repentance, into their Communion again, for
which <hi>Tertullian</hi> expostulates with the <hi>Bishop of Rome,</hi> and
accuses him of Rashness, imprudence, and breach of the
ancient Canons. However, since the <hi>Apostle</hi> himself,
<hi>2. Cor. 2. 7.</hi> received the incestuous Person into the
Communion of the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> and desired the
<hi>Corinthians</hi> to do the like, after a sufficient demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his Repentance, after such falls into wilful and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual
Sins, be sincere and true, exemplary and laborious,
that there is just hopes, such a person may renew his
Covenant, get a Title again to the promises of it, and
be readmitted to God's Favour and Complacency. But
then,</p>
            <p>1. This Repentance ought to be speedy: To live long
in such Sins, after the first wilful breach of this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
is dangerous, hardens the Heart, gives the Devil
greater power over the Soul, and the Person thus sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
knows not, but he may be given up to hardness of
Heart, and to reprobate mind, in which condition he
may be snatcht away by Death, and haled to the great
Tribunal.</p>
            <p>2. Such a Person must not make a trade of Repenting
and sinning, for if he fall often into the same Sin, and still
pretends to repent, its a sign, the Repentance is coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit,
his love to God fickle and unsincere, his resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances
of God's Spirit strong, and the inward Man
left without a Guard to secure it against the assaults of
the Devil.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="220" facs="tcp:103387:116"/>
3. Upon this new Repentance, greater watchfulness
than ordinary must be used, and the Penitent must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a gainer by his Sins, <hi>i. e.</hi> the dreadfulness of his
fall must help toward the great exemplariness of his Life;
and the Sins he hath lived in, must make them dread
them more than ever. A very signal growth in Grace
must succeed his Fall; and the Ball having been struck
against the ground, must now rebound the higher. His
time must now be redeem'd, and he, that hath been
so careless, must now double his diligence. He must
therefore love much now, because he expects, much
should be forgiven him; and his greater fervor in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
is the best demonstration of his unfeigned return
from his Apostacy,</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The Preceding Considerations reduced to Practice.</head>
               <p>I. IT must needs be great presumption, for Men and
Women to enter into a solemn Covenant with
God in this Sacrament, and not to consider the weight
and importance of it. <hi>Christian,</hi> when thou enter'st in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
this Covenant with the Holy Trinity, thou solemnly
obligest thy self, that as thou hopest for Heaven and
Happiness, as thou hopest for Pardon and Salvation, as
thou hopest to have thy Sins wash'd away with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Blood of Christ, thou wilt take Christ's Yoke up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thee, endeavour to be humble and meek, as he was,
learn of him, and die to the World, crucifie thy Lusts
and Affections, fight against the vanities of the World,
and labour to con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>orm to the great example of that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
that spilt his dearest Blood for thee. Either thou
understandest, what this engagement means, or thou
dost not: If not, how darest thou touch the Sacred Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
with polluted Hands? If thou understandest it,
and art not firmly resolv'd to take care to perform what
thou promisest so solemnly, how dost thou think to escape
the Judgement of God? Art thou afraid of breaking a
solemn promise made to a Prince and great Man, whose
Smile or Frown can either help or prejudice thee much,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:103387:116"/>
and art thou not afraid of violating thy Engagements
to the great God of Heaven? What dost thou make of
God? Dost thou take him to be some Heathen Deity
that hath Eyes, and sees not, Ears and hears not? Dost
thou oblige thy self to be his Subject, and dost thou turn
Rebel? His Child, and become a Prodigal? His Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate,
and conspire against him with his Enemies?
Dost thou take him for thy Lord, and wilt not thou do
what he saith? If these thy unfaithful dealings with thy
Lord and Master, be enter'd into Gods Book of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts,
as certainly they are, and the black Roll shall at
last be open'd and read in thine Ears, dost not thou
think, what Terror, Amazement, and Confusion thou
wilt be in! O Sinner! There is no jesting with such
Bonds and Obligations. The God thou hast to deal
withal, is a jealous God, and if these Engagements can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
oblige thy Soul to a serious Conversation, they'll be
witnesses to promote and hasten thy Condemnation.</p>
               <p>II. See here, what a miserrble and doleful state it is,
not to be in Covenant with God. He that is not, hath
no security from the wrath of God, the Threatnings of
the Gospel are in force against him, and he knows not,
how soon the Thunderbolt will fall upon his Head:
Like a condemn'd Malefactor, he is repriev'd for a
while, and can promise himself a share only of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Blessings, which the Great Creator bestows indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently
upon his Friends and Enemies. Not to be in
Covenant with him, is to be dead to his Paternal Grace
and Favour, and to be depriv'd of those Influences, which
make the Saints joyful in Glory, and cause them to sing
aloud upon their Beds. Till you are in Covenant with your
God, you can have no hopes of Pardon, your Sins remain
upon you, and that load will crush you at last into de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair.
O think of it you that never made such a Covenant
with your God in good earnest: Notbeing in Covenant
with him, Christ's Blood, and Death, and Wounds, and
Agonies, do not profit you: And for you, <hi>O miserable
Creatures, Christ</hi> died in vain, that Damnation, Christ
came to deliver the World from, continues to be your
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:103387:117"/>
Portion; and should you die in that condition, you are
undone to all intents and purposes. Till you are in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
with God, you are under the power of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and under the Government of the worst of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants;
you are Slaves in the midst of all your jollities,
Bondmen in the midst of your Pleasures: You laugh
in Chains, triumph in your Fetters, and stand upon the
brink of Destruction. O do not make light of this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
state; your making light of it, speaks you des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate;
but being concern'd at your danger, may yet
be a means to free your selves from the Net, you are at
present intangl'd in: Fear of being undone, may yet
keep you from it, and sorrow that you have not seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
thought of it, may yet turn the stream, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
the Heart of God to you into Mercy and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion;
therefore it is, that we <hi>instruct you in meekness,
if God, peradventure will give you Repentance to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging
of the Truth, and that you may recover your
selves out of the Snare of the Devil, who have been taken
captive by him at his Will,</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 26.</p>
               <p>III. From hence it appears, how necessary it is for
People, when young, to make or renew this Covenant
with their God; As no Man can close too early with
the offers of Grace; so if this Covenant were made by
all young Men and Women seriously, and with delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
what a restraint would it be upon their juvenal
Desires! What a curb to their extravagant Fancies!
What an Armour against Sin, and the ill examples of
the World! How would this considerate Engagement
keep them in, and fright them from consenting, when
sinners do entice them! The reason, why it hath not
this effect upon them, is, because it is not made with
suitable applications of the Mind to the importance of
it, or to the Greatness and Majesty of that God, with
whom it is made, and to the danger and hazard they
run, in breaking of it for every trifle that comes in their
way, and when they have made it, they do not keep
their Hearts warm by ruminating upon what they have
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:103387:117"/>
done, nor do they renew it so often as they might, and
should do, Were it preserv'd fresh and green, and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing
in their Minds, it would harden them against
impression of all those little allurements, which now
draw their Affections and their Souls another way; Did
they think, when a sinful shew, when vain company,
when a glozing pleasure, when a base suggestion invites
them to consent, <hi>I have wash'd my Feet, how shall I defile
them again! I have given my self up to the disposal of him,
to whom all Power in Heaven and Earth is given, How can
I be faithless, and escape his Anger! I have in this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
made a resignation of my Heart to him, that rescued me
from the burning Lake, how shall I break with him, and escape
his displeasure! I have consecrated my self to a greater Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
How shall I debase my self, and serve such pitiful no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things!
I have but one Soul, and have given that away to
my Redeemer, How shall I espouse this Vanity! I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd
Obedience to him, that washed me with his Blood, How
shall I obey his Enemy!</hi> Such Thoughts as these, repeated
often, would make the Heart inflexible to all the charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
intreaties of the World, or the Devil; and Oh! that
you would but make this Tryal, you would find, that
we are <hi>not Mad, but speak the words of Truth and Sober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
as <hi>St. Paul</hi> told <hi>Festus,</hi> in a case not much unlike
this, <hi>Acts 26. 25.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IV. It's no very difficult thing, to come to a Holy
certainty, and assurance, that we are in Covenant with
God. It must needs be difficult to the unwilling; and
to him that hopes, God's Favour will fly into his Mouth
without seeking it, any thing seems hard; and if it were
difficult, the difficulty is not insuperable, especially if we
look into the conditions of the Covenant, There is no
man that is in his Wits, but may upon a diligent search
find, and know, whether he heartily agrees to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
and whether he promises, what is required on
his part, out of love to the ways of Religion, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he makes conscience of performing his promises.
It's true, the Heart is deceitful, but that it is so, is our
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:103387:118"/>
own fault, we may remedy that deceitfulness, if we will
search it, and, by the Rules Christ hath prescribed in the
Gospel, bring it into order. It is not to be imagin'd,
that God would leave us in uncertainties, in so great a
concern as this, and he that bids us apply the Comforts
of this Covenant, must be supposed to have left us signs
and characters, whereby we may know that we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates
with him, and have a right to what he hath
said, he'll do for us, and there can be no greater cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,
than the testimony of our Conscience, that our
engagements influence our Spirits, keep us in awe, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
with us to be cautious, and can do more with us,
than a base Lust, or any sinful gain and pleasure. If
thou freely resignest thy self to the guidance and directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of thy Creator, Redeemer and Sanctifier, and the
love of God, manifested in this Covenant, works upon
thine Affections, and thou art content to be ruled by
ois Law, art sensible of the equity and reasonableness
of it, consentest to his injunctions, not only professest
subjection, but actually endeavourest to submit to what
he commands, and art willing without any reserves,
that not only thine Understanding, Will, and Desires,
but thine outward Man too, thine Eyes, and Ears, and
Feet, and Gestures, and Behaviour, thy Reason, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
and Passion should all be at his beck, move by his
prescription, act according to his appointment, be sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned
with his Grace, and conducted by his Wisdom;
If thou art content, that all shall go, rather than his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour;
if his Love, or a share in it, be dearer to thee,
than the dearest of all outward enjoyments; be of good
cheer, it's a good sign, and thou mayst rationally infer,
that thou art in Covenant with thy Lord, and hast a
right to all the priviledges, that are annex'd to it for thy
encouragement.</p>
               <p>V. And here, we may justly reflect, what a mercy
it is to be in Covenant with God; a mercy indeed,
which no Tongue can express, nay, no <hi>Apollos</hi> neither,
as eloquent as he was, can describe, no <hi>Tertullus,</hi> no <hi>Cicero,</hi>
                  <pb n="225" facs="tcp:103387:118"/>
no <hi>Demosthenes</hi> represent according to its worth; a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
which no Man knows, save he who receives it; a
mercy weich fills the Tongues of departed Saints with
praises; a mercy which unhappy Souls that groan among
Devils, would give Millions for, if they had them; a
mercy which sweetens all Conditions, makes Sickness
easie, and Iron Chains sit soft, mitigates pain, and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
grief and anguish; A mercy, which made the
penitent Publican stand confounded, amaz'd the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<hi>Magdalen,</hi> caused <hi>St. Paul</hi> to go chearfully through
Stripes and Imprisonment, and encouraged the Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of old to defie death and torments. He that is in
Covenant with God, enjoys all that Son of God en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys,
though not as yet in fruition and possession, yet
in title and reversion; God the Father carries him on his
Wings, as the Eagle doth her young, the Eternal Son
of God is his faithful Friend; The Holy Spirit of God
speaks to him in the still voice of peace and comfort.
He that is in this Covenant, is safe in the midst of Spears
and Arrows, safe when he goes through the Water, safe
when he passes through the Fire, safe when the Waves
do roar, safe when Hell gapes upon him, safe in a Storm,
safe at Sea, safe on the Shore, safe in his Life, safe in his
Death; God is concern'd for him, in all his afflictions
He is afflicted; The Lord Jesus is touch'd with his infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
and the Spirit of God makes intercessions for
him with groans that cannot be utter'd. In a word,
<hi>there is no Condemnation to them, that are in Christ Jesus,
to them, that walk not after the Flesh, but after the Spirit,</hi>
Rom. 8. 1.</p>

               <p>O God! whose pity is infinite! whose compassion knows
no bounds! How shall I extol thy Humiliation! How
shall I admire thy condescension to this poor Worm! Will God,
the Great, the omnipotent God, look upon such an one as I?
Wilt thou enter into a Covenant with this lump of Clay?
wilt thou tye, and oblige thy self to do me good? The Favour
is wonderful! I could not have thought it possible, but that
thou hast most graciously revealed it to me. I believe, Lord!
help my unbelief! Behold, I am Servant, the <hi>Son</hi> [the

unto thy Word. I accept of thy offer. I count my self hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,

my Guide to lead me, my Director to conduct me, my King

unite my Will to thy Will. Grant me to desire, what thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightest

without licentiousness, Sorrowful without dejection, Grave
without affectation, nimble in Religion without lightness, Fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

a Heart unbroken by afflictions, unaffected with the vanities
of the World, that may not swell with prosperity, nor sink in

adversity. Grant me understanding to know thee, diligence
to seek thee, wisdom to find thee, a readiness to please thee,
perseverance to wait for thee, and confidence at last to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace

assistance. Make me faithful to my God, faithful to my Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
faithful to mine own Soul, faithful in my Calling, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
in the discharge of my Duty, faithful in my Promises,
faithful in my Conversation, faithful in my Love, faithful in

            <head type="sub">Of frequent receiving the Holy Communion, and
the necessity of it.</head>
            <argument>
               <head>The ONTENTS.</head>
               <p>Frequent coming to the Lord's Table, the Practise of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Christians. Receiving every Lord's Day, an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
observance. Different Customs, in different Churches.
Decay of a good life, the cause of Communicating seldom.
The necessity of frequent Communicating, shewn in four
particulars, as the Eucharist is a great preservative against
Sin, an engagement to emulate Christ's Virtues, a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
to Charity, and the frequent coming, a thing very
pleasing to God. Inquiry made, how often a conscientious
Christian is bound to Communicate; The measures of that
Obligation to be taken, partly from the Orders of the Church
we live in, and partly from the fervency of our love to
Christ. An Objection drawn from the danger of contempt,
and disesteem of the Ordinance, if we come often, answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
Arguments to prove, that lawful business in the
World, is no just impediment of Communicating frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
An Expostulation, pressing frequent Receiving. The
frequent Communicant, an Object of Divine Mercy. The
Prayer.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>I. THough the Example of the Primitive Believers
is not properly a Law, yet we may have leave
to infer so much from it, that being well acquainted
with the Will of <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Apostles,</hi> in those Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
especially. which were universal, we ought not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
very urgent reasons to depart from that Pattern<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="229" facs="tcp:103387:120"/>
and if this Rule hold, frequent communicating at the
Lords Table, will become, if not absolutely necessary,
yet highly useful and expedient, since it was the practise
of the best of Men, in the best of Ages, and of this the
<hi>Acts</hi> of the <hi>Holy Apostles</hi> give us a very large account,
particularly <hi>Ch. 2. 42. 46.</hi> which place being general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
understood of the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> it must follow, that the
Believers did daily participate of it. But this seems to
have been a custom peculiar to the Church of <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi>
for though <hi>St. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>yprian, St. Chrysostom,</hi> and <hi>St. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin</hi>
speak of some places in their time, where the <hi>daily
Sacrifice</hi> was celebrated, yet even in the <hi>Apostles</hi> days we
find, other Churches did not tie themselves to that pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise,
particularly that of <hi>Troas,</hi> where the Communion
was celebrated every Lords Day only, as <hi>St. Luke</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms
us, <hi>Act. 20. 7.</hi> And <hi>upon the first day of the week,
when the Disciples came together to break Bread, Paul
preach'd unto them;</hi> and this custom the <hi>Apostles</hi> seem to
have establish'd in most Churches, because it was fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
almost in all places, not only while they lived, but
after they had left the world; and continued for seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Centuries, till Zeal and Fervor in the House of God
decayed; and because none of the Ancients hath so ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
described this custom as <hi>Justin Martyr,</hi> who lived in
the second Century, or 150 years after
Christ,<note place="margin">Just. Mart. Apol. 1. pro Christianis. <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, &amp;c.</note> it will not be amiss to set down
his words, which are. <hi>On the day, called</hi>
Sunday, <hi>all who are either in the City or
Country, come together in one place, and the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries,
or Writings either of the Apostles
or Prophets, as time will permit, are read to the
Congregation. The Reader having done, the</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>President, or the Chief Minister
of the Church makes an Oration, in which he instructs the
hearers; and exhorts them to a sincere imitation of the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
things, that have been delivered to them. Upon this,
we all rise, and apply our selves to Prayer. This done, Bread,
and Wine, and Water are brought forth, and the President,
as far as he is able, offers to Almighty God Prayers and Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:103387:121"/>
at which the People joyfully say,</hi> Amen; <hi>Whereupon
distribution is made of the consecrated things to all that are
present; If any be absent, the Deacons carry them to their
Houses: Those, who are of the richer sort, contribute Alms
every one according to his ability, and what is thus gathered,
is deposited in the President's hand; and out of that he re,
lieves Orphans, and Widows, and such as, by reason of sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
or some other distresses, have need of it; such also as
are in bonds, and poor Strangers, that come to him; in a word, he
is a Steward to all that are in want; And on Sunday parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
we meet thus, because it is the first day in which God,
out of darkness and matter, which he had created before, fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
this visible World, and Jesus Christ our Redeemer rose
that day from the Dead, for the day before</hi> Saturday <hi>he was
Crucified, and after that, which is</hi> Sunday, <hi>he appear'd to his
Disciples, and bid them do what we have here related.</hi> To
this purpose speaks <hi>Tertullian,</hi> who lived about Fifty years
after him; and of this <hi>Lords Day,</hi> it's probable, <hi>Pliny</hi> the
Heathen Governor spoke, when giving <hi>Trajan</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror
an account of the life and manners of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
he tells them that they used to meet <hi>Stato die,</hi> on
a set day; In a word, for Believers to receive the <hi>Lord</hi>'s
<hi>Supper</hi> every <hi>Lord</hi>'s <hi>Day,</hi> was counted in those Ages as
necessary as publick Prayer, and hearing the Word of
God explained. In <hi>Epiphanius</hi>'s time it was customary,
in some places to receive the Holy Communion thrice
a week, and they looked upon that practise, as derived
from an <hi>Apostolical Tradition,</hi> viz. <hi>Wednesdays, Fridays</hi> and
<hi>Sundays.</hi> In some Churches, as <hi>Socrates</hi> informs us,
they had a Sacrament constantly on the Sabbath-day, or
<hi>Saturday,</hi> but that was much disliked by the Churches
of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Alexandria; St. Basil</hi> makes mention of
a Custom in his time, which was to Communicate four
times a week, <hi>Wednesdays, Fridays, Saturdays</hi> and <hi>Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days.</hi>
Afterwards, some received the Holy Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
once in three weeks. At last, as all things in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress
of time, deviate from the first Institution, the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
came to Receiving of it thrice in a year, which
they thought, was the least, a Man, who profess'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:103387:121"/>
a Christian, could do, which occasioned that Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
in the <hi>Council of</hi> Turin, that a <hi>Lay-man, who did
not Communicate thrice a year, should be Excommunicated, or,
which is the same, not be counted a Christian;</hi> from which
Historical reflections, it's evident, that, in the purer
Ages of the Church, frequent Communion was counted
a very necessary Duty.</p>
            <p>II. What was necessary then, cannot, must not, be
counted needless now; and the reasons that enforce the
necessity of it, at this Day, are these following.</p>
            <p>1. It must be granted, that this frequent Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating
is a very great preservative against Sin: The Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens
talk'd much of their Amulets, and preservatives
against the Arts of Sorcerers and Magicians; but this,
without any Superstition, may more truly be called a
preservative against the Witchcraft of Sin, and offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
God. Nothing is more rational, for in this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
the demerit of Sin is represented in very sad Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters.
In the Wounded and Mangled Body of our
Great Master, in the Anguish His Soul was in, upon the
account of our Sins, we behold what odious and mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous
things they are, how abominable to God's purer
Eyes, how contrary to His Holiness, and what a sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
they make betwixt the Creator and the Creature;
how they move Him to forsake us, to withdraw His
Gracious Presence from us; What fears, what trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blings,
what shame, what ignominy, what sorrow, and
what grief they cause. All this certainly is to be seen in
the floods of Misery, which fell upon our <hi>Mediator,</hi> who
undertook our Cause, bore our Sins upon the Cross, and
was made Sin for us, put his Shoulder under our Griefs,
and carried our Sorrows, was wounded for our Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions,
and bruised for our Iniquities: And having
taken that tremendous burden upon himself, see,
how he was rejected, despised, forsaken, trampled on,
what horror, what fears, what darkness fell upon Him,
which is an <hi>Item,</hi> not only of what our Sins have deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:103387:122"/>
but of what we shall feel everlastingly, if we em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
not this Mediator as our Sovereign Lord, or are
not resolved to tread in his steps; for when he cry'd,
<hi>My God, why hast thou forsaken me?</hi> it was not for his own
sake, that he fell into this exclamation, but for ours, to
shew, that the Sinner, who, after this, would not repent,
should be forsaken of God for ever: And can I see in
this great Example, how God will deal with me, if I
neglect the calls of Grace and Mercy? And can I be
so brutish, and hug those Sins, which, upon my account,
were so severely lashed in him, that was my Surety, who
stept in and took the Blow, that would have lighted
upon me? All the Goodness, Holiness and Divinity,
that was in this Saviour of Mankind, could not make
the Sins, he bore, look lovely in the Eyes of God; and
though he was the Son of God, yet our Sins being laid
upon him, as they were on the Sacrifice under the Law,
God's Justice and Purity would not dispense with looking
upon them with a favourable Eye; and though he was
the dearly beloved of his Eternal Father, yet God pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
those Sins in him in a very terrible manner, to
let us know, that if we accept not of the remedy, <hi>Christ</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
us, do not make his Cross a motive to Conversion,
they shall be thus punished in our persons, and that to
all Eternity. All this is represented to us in this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
a Saviour groaning, and weeping, and sighing
under the burthen of our Sins, and thereby giving no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,
that if we grow not weary of Sin, we shall weep,
and groan, and sigh for ever; and shall not the dreadful
Spectacle fill my Soul with abhorrency and detestation,
of what I see so signally punished? Shall not I run away
from it, and say to it, <hi>Get thee hence, thou evil and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean
Spirit, touch me not, what agreement hath the Temple
of God with Idols?</hi> And if this Holy Sacrament be so
great a preservative against Sin, surely we cannot too
often make use of it, especially, since we see, how easily
Sin doth beset us, how often we are tempted to it, and
how we are daily encompassed with suggestions and
provocations to it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="233" facs="tcp:103387:122"/>
2. This <hi>frequent Communicating</hi> cannot but be a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
engagement to a pious emulation of the Virtuous and
Gracious Life of the Ever-Blessed <hi>Jesus.</hi> There is none
but knows, how frequent going into company, that is
of such a Temper, and seeing their Manners and way
of Acting, is apt to produce assimulation of Disposition
in the persons that frequent it: That Society, a Man
frequently resorts to, gives a tincture to his Nature and
Inclination, and consequently, the frequent seeing and
conversing with the Holy and Gracious <hi>Jesus</hi> in this
Sacrament, is very likely to have the same effect. For
in this Ordinance, we do not only come to see him
Bleeding and Dying, for his Enemies, but to look upon
his eminent Virtues too, his wonderful Meekness, his
deep Humility, his unparalell'd Patience, his chearful
Submission to the Will of God, his admirable Self-resig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
his unshaken Contentedness, his generous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of the World, and his steady living in the thoughts
of future Bliss and Glory? Can I see these Virtues shine
in his noble Soul, and remember, that they are set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
me to raise my desires of being like him, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that God expects, and requires of me to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
them on my Temper? Can I see, how lovely,
how amiable, and how beautiful these Graces are, how,
in the midst of all his troubles, they proclaim him to be
the Son of God; and, in despight of all the contempt
and scorn of Men and Devils, speak him to be a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite
of Heaven? Can I see, how in the midst of
all the Affronts and Derisions, and Indignities he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured,
these Graces still made him amiable, glorious in
a Storm, bright in that dismal Night-dress, Illustrious
in Misery, Magnificent in Poverty? Can I see how
these Diamonds glister in the black Jet, in which they
are placed, and, notwithstanding the dull matter that
doth encompass them, are Diamonds still of an infinite
value, prized by God, esteemed by Angels, magnified
by all good Men, agreeable to Reason, conformable to
Gods Nature? Can I see all this, and continue stubborn
and obstinate, and an enemy to these Virtues? Is not
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:103387:123"/>
this enough to make me enamour'd with them, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
me to long for them, and to cause a disquiet in my
Soul, till it be possess'd of these inestimable Treasures?
And if this Sacrament be such an engagement to this pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Emulation, and endeavour after the same gracious
Qualifications, is it not fit, is it not expedient, is it not
reasonable, is it not necessary, that I should communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
frequently, and Eat often, and Drink often at this
Table, except I am afraid of being too lively, too good,
or too serious?</p>
            <p>3. This Sacrament is a <hi>mighty promoter of fervent Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;</hi>
and since the frequent exercise of this Charity is
necessary, frequent Comunicating must be so too, this
being the cause, or incentive, to the other. That in
an eminent manner it promotes and encourages Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and Love to our Fellow Christians, Concord and
Unity, Peace and Amity, readiness of Mind to do
good, and bowels of Kindness to our Brethren, none
can doubt, that's sensible, what Charity is represented in
this Ordinance: Here I see, how the Great Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of Heaven and Earth offers Reconciliation to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate
Offender; and whereas the Offender should be
the first, that should seek and implore God's Pardon,
God prevents him, and with his Royal hands unask'd,
bestows upon him a Patent of Grace and Mercy: Here
I see, how the Supream Judge, who hath absolute pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
over our Life and Death, is willing to be friends with
a wretch that owes him Ten thousand Talents, and
willing frankly to forgive him all, to discharge him of
all his Debts, and to supersede all Actions against him.
Here I see, how the Everlasting Father is ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Prodigal into his House again, to admit him
to his Table, who had spent all his Substance in riotous
living, ready to kill the fatted Calfe for him, to put a
Ring on his Finger, and to betroth him to himself in
Righteousness: Here I see, how he, before whom all
Nations are as Grashoppers, offers to embrace the Worm
that hath resisted him, spoken ill of him, prostituted
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:103387:123"/>
his Glory, expos'd Religion, and studied and contrived
ways to dishonour him. Here I see the Son of God rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
with the Balsom of his Blood, to anoint the Wretch
that made the Wounds, and dying for the Men, the
multitude of whose Offences hath seemed to vye with
the number of God's Mercies. Here I see how infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
Light offers to twist its Rays with loathsome Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
and how the greatest Prince proceeds to those ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses
of Humility, as to give the greatest Sinners room
and entertainment in his Banqueting-House, to call
them Brethren and Friends, and sheep of his Flock,
than which, there are scarce more endearing Titles: All
this I behold here, and shall not such a wonderful Scene
of Charity blow those little sparks of Affection, I find
within, into greater flames? Can I see here what God
hath done for me, who have acted more treacherously
against him, than my greatest Enemy ever did against
me, and shall not this raise Compassion in me to my
Fellow-servants; and move me to lay down all Wrath
and Enmity to them, whose Injuries are but Fleabites
in comparison of those, I have offered to the <hi>Best of
Beings?</hi> And if this Sacrament be so strong an engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to this Charity, it stands to reason, that frequent
Communicating must be necessary too, the rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
we are so often in danger of breaking the bond
of Peace, and dissolving the cement, which must hold
and knit Christians together. So that.</p>
            <p>4. This <hi>frequent Cammunicating</hi> cannot but be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to God, and this he declared in the example of the
Primitive Believers, whose frequent receiving did so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
the Favour of God toward them, that the <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelist</hi>
takes notice, <hi>Acts 2. 47. The Lord added to the
Church daily such as should be saved.</hi> In this the Divine
Bounty expressed its liking of their frequent repairing
to the Table of the Lord: This was not only a reward
of their frequent Communion, but God made that fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency
a motive to others, to embrace the true Religion.
Nothing works upon strangers more to joyn themselves
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:103387:124"/>
to the Mystical Body of Christ, than to see the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors
live up to their Principles, and maintain the rules
their Master hath given them; This enforces even such,
as are Aliens to the Commonwealth of <hi>Israel,</hi> to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
one another in the Language of those votaries, we
read of <hi>Psal. 122. 1, 2, 3. Let us go into the house of the
Lord, our Feet shall stand within thy Gates,</hi> O Jerusalem!
Jerusalem <hi>is builded as a City, that is compact together, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Tribes go up, the Tribes of the Lord, unto the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
of</hi> Israel, <hi>to give Thanks unto the name of the Lord,
for there are set Thrones of Judgment, the Thrones of the
House of</hi> David: <hi>Pray for the Peace of</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>they shall
prosper that love thee, Peace be within thy Walls, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity
within thy Palaces; for my brethren and companions
sake, I will now say, Peace be within thee, because of the
House of the Lord our God, I will seek thy good.</hi> So that
what the Apostle, <hi>1 Cor. 14. 22.</hi> says of the gift of
Tongues, the same may be said of frequent Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating,
that it is <hi>a sign to them that believe not.</hi> Hereby
they are perswaded to believe, seeing the Professors act
like persons that believe what their Master hath said.
This frequent Communicating shews their Zeal and
Unity, and there is no Man vers'd in <hi>Ecclesiastical Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
but knows how much these two prevailed with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels
to come in to the Sheep-fold of <hi>Christ Jesus.</hi> It
being evident therefore, that this frequent Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating
is very acceptable to God, how can we say, we
love him, if we are loath to do what we know will
please him? The <hi>Father hath not left me alone,</hi> saith our
Saviour, because <hi>I do always the things that please him,</hi>
Joh. 8. 29. And the same may be applied to the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
Communicant; the Father will not leave him
alone; He will be sure to guard him, though a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
fall on his side, and ten thousand on his right hand,
yet he'll take care, that no evil shall happen unto him,
for he doth those things that please him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="237" facs="tcp:103387:124"/>
III How often a conscientious Christian is bound to
Communicate, the Scripture hath not thought fit to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine:
That it ought to be done <hi>often,</hi> the Apostle
doth sufficiently intimate, <hi>1 Cor. 11. 26.</hi> but there is no
Law extant in the whole Gospel, that saith, So <hi>many
times a Year, or Month, or Week, you shall appear at the
Lord's Table;</hi> and from hence rose that variety of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms
in several Churches, we mentioned before: And
what <hi>Socrates</hi> observes in this point, is very probable,
that that variety of practice derived its Original from
the various Judgments and Constitutions of Bishops, in
their several Dioceses, which with their posterity past
into a Law; yet though they varied in Times, and Days,
and Hours, yet it's easier to gather from those various
customs, that all made conscience of coming frequently
to the Holy Communion, till Ignorance and Vice inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the Priesthood, as well as the Laity; and when the
Priests became regardless of this Ordinance, no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel
if the Laity did either despise or neglect it. And
most certainly, to Communicate once, or twice, or
thrice a Year, cannot be called frequent eating of this
Bread, and drinking of this Cup, for this is to do it
but seldom, and is an argument that we are not very so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous
to gain, or preserve our Master's Favour and
good Will, which is ever kept warm by frequent Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses
and Importunity. It was therefore an unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
act of Pope <hi>Innocent the Third,</hi> in the <hi>Lateran Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,</hi>
in the year 1215. to make a Canon for Laymen,
that it <hi>was sufficient for them to Communicate but once a
year,</hi> for hereby they fell into great Ignorance, Debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery,
and Sensuality, and that which should have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
them from Sin, being so seldom administred to
them, they sunk daily into greater barbarity. This <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trus
Cluniacensis</hi> was so sensible of, that, having under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
of the <hi>Petrobrusians,</hi> that they had a Communion
but once a year, he thus expostulates with them, <hi>You
say, once only; but Christ and his Apostles say, not once, or
twice, or thrice, or an hundred times, or a thousand times
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:103387:125"/>
only, but as often as you do it.</hi> There is a great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between <hi>as often,</hi> and <hi>once</hi> or <hi>twice. Here is the
beginning of numbers, but the other expression exceeds all num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers;
here is more singularity, but in the other is infinite
multiplicity.</hi> The <hi>Arabians</hi> have a Proverb, <hi>Visit seldom,
and you increase Love;</hi> but, however this Maxim may
hold among Men, I am sure it is not so with God, who,
in the commendation of his Servants lays their stress up-the
assiduity in his Service; and therefore, when the
Holy Ghost speaks in the praise of <hi>Anna</hi> the <hi>Prophetess,</hi>
he gives her this Character, that though <hi>she was a Widow
of about fourscore and four years,</hi> yet <hi>she departed not from
the Temple, but served God with Fastings and Prayers
night and day.</hi> I know, this is not spoken with respect
to this Sacrament, but all that I prove from it, is this,
that the assiduity and frequency of Divine Worship, is
that, which God is pleased to make a sign, not only
of his Love, but our Sincerity too. His kindness to our
Souls advances with our Importunities, and frequent
Adorations cause frequent influences of his Love; and
since the Holy Ghost hath not thought fit to resolve,
how many times in the year we are to Communicate,
on purpose to leave room for our Free-will-offerings,
the Examples of the Saints of old, are a very safe Rule
to go by; in our civil Affairs, where a Statute is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Customs and Presidents are a Law, and we think
it reasonable it should be so; and when <hi>St. Paul</hi> calls
to us in the style of a Command, <hi>Brethren, be followers
of me, and mark them that walk so, having us for an ensam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi>
Phil. 3. 17. The Examples of the Saints of old will
be found to be of greater force in our practise, than is
generally believed; and though the antient Churches
have had different customs in this particular, yet that,
which most have agreed on, may justly oblige us to
imitation. However, nothing is more certain, than
that we are placed under Governors, whose lawful Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
we are to obey; and as the Governors of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective
Churches, have power to order the circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
and decent part of Divine Worship, so he acts most
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:103387:125"/>
safely that conforms to the constitutions of the Church,
he is of; and since in the Church, we are Members of,
both to prevent contempt of this Sacrament by too fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
coming, and Peoples hardning their Hearts in Sin,
by a too long neglect of it, it is thought fit to receive
the Holy Communion once a Month; we have not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
great reason to conform to that order, but to thank
God, we are encouraged to this frequent Devotion. In
some particular Churches among us, a Communion
every <hi>Lord' Day</hi> is kept up, according to the Primitive
Rule; however, a Month is a just distance, to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
what progress we make in Goodness, and what ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
the last Communion hath upon our Spirits, and
though I can alledge no express Command for it, out
of the Word of God, yet there is a Command which
imports as much, even this, <hi>Obey them that have the Rule
over you in the Lord, and submit your selves, for they watch
for your Souls, as they that must give an account, that they
do it with Joy, and not with Grief,</hi> Heb. 13. 17. But these
Arguments are needless to a Soul, that hath a lively Sense
of the Love of God. Love will run without a driver;
and there needs no pulling, or haling him to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
who hath seen and tasted how sweet and how
gracious the Lord is. That inward Sense will make him
come frequently, whether his Superiours command
him or no. He that doth nothing in Religion but what his
Governo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s force him to, doth not yet understand what
that means, <hi>The Love of God is shed abroad in our Hearts.</hi>
He that hath this Sense, finds a Law within stronger
than the Law of all Superiors, and which hath greater
power with him, than all external motives. He that
loves Christ fervently, will love to be with him frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
and since the Communion Table is the place, where
Christ hath promised to him, he'll be as often there as
he can, except Sickness, or some such inevitable impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments
hinder him, the rather, because here Men <hi>hear
the joyful sound of</hi> Pardon, and <hi>walk in the light of God<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s

               <pb n="240" facs="tcp:103387:126"/>
IV. But because I foresee, it will be objected here,
That frequent Communicating will abate our esteem and
veneration of this Sacrament, as all things, when grown
common and familiar, are apt to breed contempt and
carelesness: It's fit I should answer, and remove that
pretended stumbling-block. And therefore,</p>
            <p>1. It cannot be frequent Communicating, consider'd
in it self, that abates our Zeal and Fervor to this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance;
for, let the Communion be never so frequent, the
Arguments and Motives are still the same, their Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur,
Strength, Force and Power, is still the same; still
these are able to kindle holy Fire on the Altars of our
Souls, to raise admiration of God's Mercies; aud to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liven
our Spirits into Conscientiousness and severity of
life; and if this be the natural tendency of these Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivies
at one time, it is so to another, and consequently
the abatement of our esteem and veneration, is not the
necessary effect of frequent Communicating; and in
this the Primitive Believers are a signal instance, who,
though they Communicated some every day, some eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Lord's day, yet did not that frequency lessen their
Veneration of these mysteries. It rather increas'd and
cherish'd it; and we have reason to ascribe their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of Sublunary Contents, their Courage in Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity,
their Valour in Persecution, their ardent desires after
another Life, their invincible Patience under reproaches,
their Constancy in the severest Tryals, their wonderful
Joy in Troubles, and their prodigious Self-denials to this
frequent Communicating. This as it was a means to
set their Master always before their Eyes, so it left an
aw upon their Spirits, not to dishonour him by their
lives. This was a perpetual curb to their Lusts, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
his Image constantly before them, made them walk
as Children of their Father, which is in Heaven; so that,
if frequent Communicating be not the necessary cause
of an abatement, in our veneration of this Sacrament,
it must be some other accidental thing, which may be
remedied, that must occasion it. And therefore,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="241" facs="tcp:103387:126"/>
2. Some decay in the Receiver, some indisposition in
the inward Man, must be charged with this dis-esteem
of the ordinance; and it is not the frequent Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating,
that is the cause, but want of care, and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s
in the Communicant. Indeed, where People
approach this Holy Table frequently, and bring no
Hearts with them, no desires after a better Life, do not
think it worth while to spend serious thoughts on the
Death they are going to remember, come to it without
any design of being like Christ, premise only a few Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
out of Custom, touch the Ark with unwashen hands,
dive not into their hearts, nor do prepare themselves for
this Banquet, thrust themselves in, as the Guest in the
Gospel, without suitable Ornaments, do not plow up
the fallow Ground, or do not make it soft and Mellow
with Meditation and Praises, and consider not what they
come for, or to what end and purpose they give their
attendance at the Altar, there we need not wonder, if
frequent Communicating abates their esteem and vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of this Sacrament; but this is their Sin, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
Communion is not to be blamed; it's their love
to the World, that will not suffer them to bring that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
watchfulness and devotion with them, as is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
to the comfortable use of this Ordinance; a Sin
which must be deplored, and, like the cursed thing in the
Camp of <hi>Israel,</hi> removed before they come to see the
goings of God in the Sanctuary. The Covetous Man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates
not in his esteem of his Wealth and Treasure, though
he look upon it every day, and the reason is, because
his Affections are set upon it; and were our Affections
set upon him, from whose fulness we all received Grace
for Grace, our frequent Communicating would be so
far from lessening our esteem of this Sacrament, that it
would render it more lovely and more amiable to our
Souls. Two Men of the same Trade live together, the
one grows rich, the other continues poor, the one thrives,
the other decays, because the one is industrious, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
lazy, one minds his business the other lies in Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houses
and Taverns: This is the Case here; if some fall
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:103387:127"/>
into a disesteem of the greatness of this Ordinance, by
frequent Communicating, it is because they take no
pains with their Souls, before they Communicate, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
others, who are laborious and careful, though they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieve
never so often, they go on from strength to strength,
till every one of them appears before God in <hi>Sion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>V. But <hi>since frequent Communication requires frequent
Preparation, and frequent Preparation is a thing, that Persons
who have much business in the World, cannot attend, how can
it be supposed necessary, for such to Communicate frequently?</hi>
Though Preparation be a Subject that I intend to spend
a <hi>distinct Chapter</hi> upon, yet something may be said of it
here by the by, and by way of anticipation, to shew
the weakness of this excuse, and the vanity of this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception.
And therefore,</p>
            <p>1. Business is either lawful or unlawful: If it be unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
no conscentious Man must either involve himself in
it, or continue to mind it; for whoever applys his
Thoughts, Desires or Affections, to any business of that
nature, puts himself in a state of Damnation, and hangs
over Hell fire by a very weak and feeble Thread, even
this Transitory Life, which if it chance to break, his
Soul is lost; in a word, unlawful business makes a Man
unfit, not only for frequent Communicating, but for
Salvation too; and then his business is unlawful, if ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
out of greediness he takes too much of worldly
business upon him, more than he can well go through
with, and which must necessarily hinder him from mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his everlasting concerns, or, if his business in the
World necessitates, or necessarily engages him in Sin, as
when a Mans business engages him to Lying, or Cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or Stealing, or Extortion, or grinding the Faces
of the Poor, or unreasonable Usury, or encouraging
Men in their sins, whether Drunkenness, or Unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
or to Flattering, or Dissembling. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Where any
such Sins are so bound up with the Worldly business,
that the one cannot be performed without the other,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:103387:127"/>
there the business is unlawful, sinful, odious to God, and
must be quitted, banished, abandoned, though he beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
himself by it, though he were to starve upon quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it, for this is inconsistent with any hopes of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
and a Man had better die ten Thousand times,
than lose the comforts of Eternal life, and to be sure it
must be quitted too, that a Man may be capable of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to the Holy Communion, for, without it, he is
no more fit to be seen at this Table, than a Swine in a
Royal Chamber. If the business be lawful, it can be
no impediment to seeking first God's Kingdom and his
Righteousness, for lawful business is Commanded, and
one Command doth not clash with the other, and if it
be no impediment to a serious course of life, except a
Man will needs make it so, it can be no just impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to Prayer and Meditation, and acts of Love, and
contemplating the mystery of the Cross, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
no impediment to frequent Communicating.</p>
            <p>2. Preparation to the Holy Sacrament is either <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual</hi>
or <hi>Actual; Habitual Preparation</hi> Divines call that,
when a Man's constant care is to please God, and to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
himself faithful to God, and to be conscientious
in all his ways, when he makes it his business, and the
bent of his Soul is, to arrive to higher degrees of San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification,
and he is fully and invincibly resolved, not
to harbor any thing, that he shall know, or suspect, to
be offensive to God. This habitual Preparation is as
necessary as conversion it self; and I doubt not, but a
Man, thus prepared, may at any time, upon a very short
warning, recieve the Holy Sacrament to his Spiritual
comfort, as is manifest from the example of the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Christians, who, at first, before they were very
numerous, recieved the <hi>Eucharist</hi> every day, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
could not well come with any other Preparation, but
what was habitual. <hi>Actual Preparation</hi> consists, as we
shall shew hereafter, in retirement, suitable Prayers and
Thanksgiving, in Self-examination, and Contemplation
of the Death of Christ, and the Motives, Reasons, and
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:103387:128"/>
Benefits of it, Resolutions <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This actual Preparation
is either more <hi>prolix,</hi> or more <hi>compendious.</hi> The <hi>prolix,</hi>
or longer actual preparation is necessary, till Men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
Masters of that gracious habit, I have already
spoken of; but if this be once become the constant
guest of the Soul, if this once become an Inhabitant, a
shorter actual preparation is sufficient; and therefore,
where a man is habitually prepared, by a Consciencious
course, he may follow his lawful concerns and business
in the World, and yet that need not hinder him from
those shorter actual Preparations, requisite in frequent
Communicating. In a Word, let a Man but once, in
good earnest, proclaim War to all his known Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Imaginations, that exalt themselves against the
constitutions and Injunctions of <hi>Christ Jesus,</hi> and he
need not doubt, but that a very short actual preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
though it were only some few fervent Ejaculations,
will make him a worthy partaker of the comforts of
Divine Love, tendered to him in this Sacrament; and
consequently, lawful business can be no just impediment
to such frequent preparation: But if this I shall have
occasion to say more hereafter.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The Preceding Considerations reduced to Practice.</head>
               <p>I. IT's no wonder to see that <hi>strictness, Christ</hi> hath Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
his Followers to observe in their lives, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay
and dwindle away to nothing but Shew and Forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
in the Age we live in, since frequent Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating
is so much out of date among us. Blessed be
God, all are not of this mind, and many pious Souls we
have, which conscienciously appear at the Lord's Table,
as often as they are called to it; but still what a vast
number of miserable Souls there are abroad, who are
such perfect strangers to this frequent Communicating,
that some even die, and leave this World without ever
thinking of it; and others delay their coming to it, till
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:103387:128"/>
Death fills them with horror, upon the account of their
neglect, and others come as seldom as they can. What
shall I say to such Persons? What Arguments shall
I use with them? How shall I aggravate their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence?
Are you Christians, or are you Heathens? That
a Turk, a Pagan, a Jew, doth not shew himself at this
Holy Table, is no wonder, for he is unacquainted with
the Religion of a Crucified Saviour: But that you who
profess your selves his Disciples, should be loath to come
and see what hath been done for you upon the Cross,
what Wonders, what Miracles of Love, God hath
wrought for you on the Tree, to which the Son of God
was nailed, what can we think, what can we imagine,
but that you are Infidels under the name and shew of
Believers? How justly may I Expostulate with you, what
are you afraid of, that you either come not at all to this
<hi>Well of Salvation,</hi> or come but seldom? What frights you?
What stops your Journey? Are you afraid of parting
with that, which is death himself to your redeemer, your
Sins and Naughtiness? Are you afraid of purifying your
Selves, even as he is pure? Are you afraid of living
up to his Example? Are you afraid of losing your
foolish Delights and Satisfactions? Do you pretend to
be friends of <hi>Christ,</hi> and are you loath to accept of him
for your Friend? Doth he promise to come and meet
you in this Ordinance, and are you loath, or ashamed,
to be seen in his Company? Had you rather keep your
Trash, and Dung, and Filth, than come hither and be
made clean? Tell me not that you are willing to receive
him, if you will not receive him in his own way: In
this Sacrament he offers himself to you, if here you will
not embrace him, if here you will not express your e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem
of him, what hopes have you that he will ever be
your portion? What can the <hi>Ever-Blessed Jesus</hi> think
of you? What can he judge of you? What opinion can
he entertain of you, but that you are his Enemies, Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to his Supper, Enemies to his Love, Enemies to
your own Souls? Must you be dragg'd to your own
Happiness? Must you be forc'd to drink of this Water
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:103387:129"/>
of Life? While you keep off and stand out, are not you
the Persons that would not have this Man, this <hi>more
than Man,</hi> to Reign over you? There can no just Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
be given for your not coming frequently to this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Table, but that you are loath to agree to the Terms
of sincere Repentance and Obedience, he requires at
your hands; and are you loath to be saved? Do you
take pleasure in being Reprobates? Is it such Comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
thing to be excluded from God's favour? While
you wilfully absent your selves, do not you refuse to be
healed? Here the kind Physician comes, and declares
his Willingness to cure you by the Balsom of his Wounds,
and had you rather be sick, than of a healthful Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion?
Here is a Medicine tendered unto you, a Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine
for your sin-sick Souls, and had you rather perish,
than rise and awake, that Christ may give you life?
Hath the Son of God endured so much, gone through
such a Discipline of Torments, through Fire and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
that your Souls might live, and do you despise his
Love, Do not you Despise it, when you come so seldom
to apply it? Would not one think, that you have a mind
to be miserable, when you are so backward to come to
him, that would deliver you from your misery? Ah!
did you believe the astonishing misery of God's Love,
how would you breath, how would you pant, how
would you hunger and thirst for this Fountain, open'd
for the House of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> It's a sign your
Appetite is dull, your desires feeble, your Affections cold,
your Inclinations frozen; were all things right within,
the Fire would burn, and at last you would speak with
your tongue; <hi>I come, Lord! I come! I delight to do thy
Will!</hi> It is the Will, the Order, the Command of that
God, in whom you believe to come often, and shall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing hinder you from obeying his Command? Shall
not his Orders prevail with you? Can you prefer your
little business before his Will? Do you believe that he
must be your Judge, and will you allow always your
selves in Rebellion and Contumacy under his Injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?
<hi>If any man serve me, let him follow me, and where I am,
there shall also my Servant be,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>Joh. 12. 26.</hi>
                  <pb n="247" facs="tcp:103387:129"/>
Ah! Shall so sweet a voice be lost upon you? Shall not
this Invitation of the bleeding Jesus melt you! He was
just going to his Cross, when he said so. He was just
going to institute this Sacrament of the Cross, when he
call'd so! Ah! How sweet are these words! How full
of Kindness! How fragrant is this Breath! What can
work more upon harden'd hearts? break, break, thou stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born
heart! The Rocks sympathize with him and cleave
asunder, and cannot this voice, this voice of Mercy,
make an Alteration in thy breast! O take heed, lest
this <hi>Lamb,</hi> which came to take away the Sins of the
World, put on another shape ere-long, even that of a
<hi>Lion</hi> and roar upon you, as it is <hi>Luc. 14. 24. I say unto
you, that none of those Men that were bidden shall taste of my
Supper.</hi> I know, there are some honest Souls, who, out
of a Sense of their own unworthyness, dare not come,
and dread frequent approaching to this Table; but such
I would not fright, but win to this frequent Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and all I shall say to them, at this time, is this, Are
you willing Christ should, set up his Throne in your
Souls? Are you willing, he should tread down his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
in you, Enemies which have usurp'd his power?
Are you content, he should be formed in you, and fill
all your Faculties? Are you content, all should stoop
to him, and all that is within you should bow to his
Scepter? If so, fear not, you cannot come too often,
your frequent running to his Altar will be Incense to him,
Incense, which he'll smell, as he did <hi>Noah</hi>'s Sacrifice, and
secure you against future Destruction.</p>
               <p>II. The frequent Communicant ought to receive
some Comfort from these Instructions. But then, by the
frequent Communicant, I do not mean one, that doth
indeed come often to this Table, but knows not what
it is to be heated by the fire of Divine Love, whose
Sins are strong, and his holy desires weak, and whose
frequent coming hath made him as careless, as the vast
number of Sermons he hath heard: For such a frequent
Communicant God hath given us no comfo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ts, to such
a one we have no message, no Embassy of Peace; but
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:103387:130"/>
the frequent Receiver, whose choice of the better part
is both confirmed and encreased by frequent Receiving,
this is the Man, to whom we are bound to carry <hi>Balm</hi>
and <hi>Spices,</hi> for a <hi>Present</hi> To you it is that this word of
Consolation comes. Your frequent attending at this Table,
is living under the precious drops of the dew of Heaven
How goodly are thy Tents, <hi>O Jacob!</hi> How justly may
you say, that God loves you, when you love to be often
with him, whom your Souls do love! Surely your Souls
will grow fat and flourishing, that are so often nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at this Table! It's a sign you long for the Courts of
the Lord, and you shall certainly appear in a Nobler
Court one day, a Court where nothing is mean, nothing
trivial, nothing savouring of Terrestrial delights; but a
Court where all the Servants are Kings, and all enjoy
more, than the Greatest Monarchs of this World do:
<hi>Blessed are your Eyes, for they see, and your Ears, for they
hear.</hi> The oftner you see the precious Sacrifice on this
Table, the more endearing it will become to you; the
oftner you hear him call here, <hi>come to me, all that are wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
the more desireable will he grow in your Eyes; the
oftner you meet here, the greater will be the friendship be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
him and you, till this friend comes at last and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieves
you to himself, so that you shall be for ever with
the Lord.</p>

               <p>O Dearest Saviour, dearer to me, than Father and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther!
My Friend in all dangers, my Benefactor in all
wants, my Fortress in all troubles! I cannot but confess that
thou hast frequently called to me, frequently entreated me, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
expostulated with me, and frequently asked me, why
I would die? And I have as frequently stopt my Ears against
thy call, and been deaf to thy voice, and my follies have kept
pace with thy favours! I see my mistakes, I see my errors,
and my Sins I desire may be ever before me, I know thy voice.
It is the good Shepherd's voice, that calls me to this Table,
and thy Sheep hear thy voice. I earnestly desire to be one of
that number. O feed me with thy pleasures! O open mine
Eyes, that I may see the rich pastures, that are to be found
in thy Grave! To this Sepulchre let me repair often! O per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suade
me to look often into it, that I may, with the Holy
Woman, see the Angels sitting there. To increase my will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingness
to come frequently, visit me frequently with thy Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.
Let not my familiarity of that sight, lessen my e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem
of the Sacred Mystery. The oftner I participate of it,
the greater let my Love, my Affections and my Admiration
be! Open still new Springs of Love, when I come to this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
of thy Everlasting Love, that the New Springs may
still give new life to my Soul, new courage to do thy Will,
new Power to tread on Serpents, new resolutions to conquer all
that stops my way. And thus, my dearest Lord, transform
me by the renewing of my Mind, that I may prove, what
is the Holy, acceptable and perfect Wall of God. <hi>Amen,
Amen.</hi>

               <p>St. Pauls Command to the Corinthians, of shewing forth the
Lord's Death, till he come, not to be understood of Christ's
coming to them in the Spirit, but coming to Judgment.
This proved largely by many arguments. The reasons laid
down, why this Sacrament of the Lord's Supper is to last
to the end of the World. Christ's coming to Judgment,
proved to be a very proper object of our Contemplation in
the Recieving of the Holy Eucharist, and a help to Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and Faith, and confidence in the Goodness of God. God's
Marvellous care of our everlasting welfare, shewn, in ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

is plainly meant Christ's coming to judge the World;
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:103387:131"/>
and this hath been the unanimous belief of the universal
Church, since the Apostles time unto this day, which
makes us justly wonder at the boldness and ignorance of
<hi>Quakers,</hi> and other Enthusiasts, who have presumed to
abolish this Ordinance in their Conventicles, pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that this Sacrament was fitted only for the Infancy
of the Christian Church, but intended it should cease,
when Christ should come to them in the Spirit; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
already received <hi>Christ,</hi> as they fancy, in their first
Conversion and Regeneration, they foolishly and ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culously
imagine, that they have no need of receiving
him again, in the use of the outward Symbols, tendered
to Christians in this Sacrament. Puffed up with this
airy conceit, they run into this Sinister and Childish In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation
of the Apostle's words, contrary to the sense
of all Christian Churches, as if <hi>Till he come</hi> were as much,
as <hi>Till he come to you in the Spirit,</hi> to which impertinent
Exposition, nothing could possibly lead these silly Men,
but the Spirit of error and contempt of all human Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and undervaluing the common dictates of Reason,
and a monstrous Spiritual Pride, which not only swells
them with an opinion, that they are wiser, than all the
Christians in the World besides, but tempts them to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
insolencies and Prophanations of the Written Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of the Holy Ghost; and therfore, lest weak Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities
should be ensnared by such specious pretences, it
will be necessary to shew the unreasonableness of this
interpetation.</p>
            <p>1. There is not the least Syllable, not the least hint
given us in all the <hi>New Testamen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> that this Sacrament,
after it was once instituted, was ever to be abolished;
which made, not only the Apostles introduce it into the
Christian Congregations, while they lived, but all the
Churches, planted and founded by them, retained and
continued it, knowing nothing to the contrary, but that
this Ordinance was to be perpetual and Eternal; and
therefore, as they had recieved the necessary use of it
from those, who laid the foundation of their Religion,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:103387:132"/>
so they propagated the same to their posterity: Nay,
among the <hi>Hereticks,</hi> that left and separated from the
Church, there were very few, but what preserved the
use of this Sacrament in their Congregations; and
though they had the insolence of Blaspheming other My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries
of Christianity, yet this Ordinance they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
to abolish, being sensible that it was one of the <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
stones of Christianity:</hi> And who could imagine other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
that considered, how this Sacrament succeeded in
the room of the Passover, which was <hi>Item</hi> enough, that
it was to last for ever; for as the Passover, after its first
Institution, was to last to the end of the Jewish Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy,
that expiring with Christ's Death, so this succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
was an argument, that it was to continue while
the dispensation of Christianity should last, and that is
to the end of the World.</p>
            <p>2. No Man will deny, but that those three thousand
Souls, converted by St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Sermon, did receive the
Holy Ghost, for St. <hi>Peter</hi> expresly promises them, <hi>Acts
2. 38. Repent and be Baptized every one of you in the name
of Jesus Christ, for the Remissions of Sins, and ye shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Gift of the Holy Ghost;</hi> and this was very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
in those days, for true Penitents to receive the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghost, immediately upon their Baptism, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
before their Baptism, as <hi>Cornelius</hi> and his Company,
<hi>Act. 20. 44. 48.</hi> And though by the Holy Chost, in
those places, are meant the miraculous Gifts of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghost, speaking with Tongues, healing diseases,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet it must be granted, that in their conversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
they had the Sanctifying Spirit of God, sent upon
them, yet these very Persons, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd so received the
Spirit, <hi>continued in breaking of Bread, and in Prayer,</hi> as we
are told, <hi>Act. 2. 42.</hi> And that by breaking of Bread
there, is not meant sitting down to their private and
ordinary meals, is evident from hence, because it is
mentioned as a part of their Devotion and publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
to which their ordinary Diet cannot be referred,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:103387:132"/>
and therefore it must be the Encharist, or this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Lord's Supper, that's meant by it; for by
that Term it was usually expressed in the Primitive
Church, as we see, <hi>1 Cor. 10. 16.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Those very <hi>Corinthians</hi> to whom the Apostle writes
in the place aforementioned, and gives a Command to
shew forth the Lord's death in this Sacrament, till he
came, had already received the Spirit of God, as we
read, <hi>1 Cor. 2. 12. Now we have received, not the Spirit
of the World, but the Spirit which is of God, that we might
know the things that are freely given us of God:</hi> and to
this purpose he adds, <hi>1 Cor. 6. 11. Such were some of you,
but ye are Washed, but ye are Sanctified, but ye are justified
in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.</hi>
These Men then had received the Spirit of God, and
therefore, when the Apostle, writing to them, <hi>chap. 11.</hi>
Saith, <hi>that they should shew forth the Lords death, till he come,</hi>
most certainly he cannot mean, <hi>till he came to you in
the Spirit,</hi> for they had received this Spirit already, and
he was already come to them in the Spirit; and what
sense would it have been, to say, Ye that have received
the Spirit of Christ, must shew forth his death, till he
come to you in the Spirit, just as good sense, as if a Man
should say, Ye that are in <hi>London,</hi> must do such a thing
till you come to <hi>London;</hi> so that, if this were the sense,
the Apostle must have contradicted himself, or spoken
that which no body knew what to make of. It fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
therefore, that since by his coming in Scripture is
frequently meant, his coming to Judge the World, as
<hi>Rev. 22. 20. 1 Cor. 4. 5. Luc. 18. 8.</hi> That here it hath
the same sense, because without it, the words will not
bear a reasonable construction.</p>
            <p>4. The design of the <hi>Apostle</hi> in this 11th. Chapter, is,
to rectify several mistakes, and errors, and abuses, that
were crept in among the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> in their admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
and eating of the Lord's Supper, and this is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated
<hi>v. 17, 18.</hi> So that his intent, in writing to them,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:103387:133"/>
must be, to inform them, how they were to behave
themselves in the use of this Ordinance, what exorbitan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
they were to abandon, what evil customs they were
to retrench, what vulgar errors they were to beware
of, and consequently, his intent could not be, to abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
this Sacrament, or to teach them to use it no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
than Christ should come to them in the Spirit. He
that gives a Man directions about a good work, in
what manner he is to perform it, what he is to take heed
of in the practice of it, what Rocks and Stumbling-blocks
he is to shun, doth not perswade him to leave the good
work undone, or to neglect it, but chalks out to him only
the way he may walk in with safety, doth still allow the
work to be of Eternal Obligation, only that it may
be acceptable to God, bids him beware of the Shelves
and Sands, he may run upon in the prosecution of it;
and though, in reformation of abuses, the thing it self,
which gave occasion to the abuse, is very often cancell'd
and taken away, yet that Rule holds only in things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different.
In Duties and things Commanded, such as
the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper is, this could not
be practised, for if Ten thousand abuses were commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
about Prayer, yet Prayer would still be a Duty; and
therefore the Apostle, reforming the errors of the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rint<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ians</hi>
in the administration of this Sacrament, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be supposed to abrogate the Sacrament it self, for as
he saith, <hi>v. 20. He had received it of the Lord;</hi> i. e. by
way of a commanded Duty, which therefore could not
be abolished.</p>
            <p>5. Let us admit of this odd expression of Christ's <hi>coming
to them in the Spirit,</hi> if a Man have received the Spirit
of Christ, that's so far from being a sufficient reason to
justifie his staying away from this Sacrament, that it is
a powerful motive to come to it; not only because he,
that hath the Spirit of Christ, will be sure to do what
Christ Commands him, but because the Spirit of Christ
must be cherished, preserved, kept warm, and made
much of, which is not to be done, but by frequent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:103387:133"/>
of God's Love and Charity, and compassion
to, our immortal Souls, whereof this Sacrament doth not
only put us in mind, but gives us a faithful representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
The Spirit of God, within us, must be preserv'd
by the use of such means, God hath appointed; and
since this Sacrament is one of these means, he that neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects
it, cannot promise himself a long continuance of
that Spirit in his Soul; and what if Men, that have fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented
this Ordinance, have found no good by it, for
that must be their own fault, and because they come to
it like Swine, no wonder if they come away from it in
no better condition.</p>
            <p>6. Though it is readily granted, that true Believers, in
their first conversion, receive the Spirit of <hi>Christ,</hi> yet
that puts no stop to their receiving larger and greater
influences of it, by the use of this Sacrament: As Grace
is begun in their first conversion, so it is increased by a
conscientious use of this Ordinance. The coming to it
doth not abate the power of this Spirit, but advances it.
This Ordinance being a Spiritual Ordinance, the Spirit
of Christ is the more likely to exert its virtue in a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
Believer, that frequents it: The Cross of Christ,
which is Foolishness to the <hi>Greek,</hi> is Wisdom to the
<hi>Spiritual Man,</hi> and the more he looks upon it with suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Devotion, the greater courage and strength he will
receive from it, to fight the Battels of the Lord. The
Spirit of Christ that works in a true Believer, works by
rational Arguments, by Arguments that are most apt to
prevail with rational Men; and since nothing can be a
more effectual Argument, than the Love of Christ, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested
on the Cross, and particularly in the Sacrament
of the Cross, it must follow, that the first operations of
Christ's Spirit in the Soul, are no hindrance to his far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
operations in this Holy Sacrament.</p>
            <p>7. It's true, in this Sacrament, external Symbols and
Elements are made use of, but that's not at all improper,
or inconsistent with a Gospel state; nor do these Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bols
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:103387:134"/>
hinder any Man from worshipping God in Spirit
and in Truth, but rather promote it. If under the Gospel,
Men may make no use of external tokens, to put them
in mind of Spiritual things, the Apostle was out in his
Divinity, when he tells us, <hi>That the invisible things of
God are clearly seen, being understood by the things which are
made, even his eternal Power and Godhead,</hi> Rom. 1. 20.
Christ indeed abolished the burthensome Symbols of the
Ceremonial Law, but did no where tell us, that he would
leave no Symbols at all in his Church to remember him
by: And though we grant, what the Apostle saith, <hi>Col.
2. 20. 21. Wherefore, if ye be dead with Christ from the
Rudiments of the World, why, as though living in the World,
are ye subject to Ordinances, touch not, taste not, handle not?</hi>
Yet it plainly appears from his discourse, that he repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
no other but <hi>Judaizing</hi> Christians, who having
embraced the Christian Religion, were still observant
of the Ancient Ceremonies, which <hi>Moses,</hi> while the
Church was in its Minority, had given to the Jewish
People; such as were distinctions of Meats and Drinks,
touching dead Bodies, or any thing that was defiled
with Leprosie, touching any thing unclean, whether Man
or Beast, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whereof a large account is given in <hi>Levit.
7. 21.</hi> So that this Saying doth not reverse the Symbols,
used in the Holy Sacrament, they being of another na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and instituted upon a different design, and so far
from evacuating a Spiritual Worship, that those become
most Spiritual persons, that frequently exercise them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in a devout use of it; and therefore what arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance
must it be, for Men to think themselves wiser than
Christ himself; and when he, whose Wisdom cannot
by searching be found out, hath given us these Symbols,
and by them thought fit to help our infirmities, to fancy,
that Christ did more than he need to have done, as if
he understood not our Natures better than we? Those
that look upon those Symbols, as Crutches for weaker
Christians to lean upon, and such, as they themselves
have no need of, had need examine and search their
Hearts better, than hitherto they have done, lest they
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:103387:134"/>
be unable, when the time comes, to stand before the
Son of Man.</p>
            <p>II. Why this Sacrament is to last in the Christian
Church to the end of the World, or till Christ come to
Judgment, may easily be guess'd at; for,</p>
            <p>1. The means of Grace are the same and unaltera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the end of the World; and whatever things bore
the name of ordinary means of Grace, in the Apostles
days, still bear that Name, and shall bear it, till Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and Earth do perish; for God intended but one
Gospel to the Christian World, even that Gospel which
we have, and, after it, we are to expect no other:
This is to serve the Church, while it is a Church, and
as the Church is to last to the consummation of all things,
so this Gospel is to last, for which reason it is expresly
call'd, <hi>The Eternal Gospel,</hi> Rev. 14. 6. And the Apostle
is very peremptory in his Assertion; <hi>Though we, or an
Angel from Heaven, should Preach any other Gospel,</hi> mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
either now, or hereafter, <hi>than what we have Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to you, let him be accursed,</hi> Gal. 1. 8. And if the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be
to last to the end of the World, this Ordinance of
the Lord's Supper, in the Church, must needs last as
long, for this is part of the Gospel, as much as Prayer,
Preaching, or any other message delivered in that Book.
That which is most properly called the Gospel, or Glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidings,
is the mistery of God's reconciling the World
to himself in <hi>Christ Jesus,</hi> and this is in an eminent man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
express'd in this Sacrament, so that this Sacament
is the principal part of the Gospel, the chief subject it
treats of, the principal thing it aims at, the very foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of the whole, <hi>For other Foundation can no man lay,
than that is laid, which is Christ,</hi> saith <hi>St. Paul, 1 Cor. 3.
12.</hi> Nay, he determined with himself, not <hi>to know any
thing, save Jesus Christ, and him Crucified;</hi> which is
the very purport and scope of this Ordinance; and if
the Gospel be a thing perpetual and eternal, the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
part of it, without all peradventure, must be so.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="258" facs="tcp:103387:135"/>
2. The comforts of Christian Souls are to last, while
Christians live in the World, and that, by virtue of
Christ's <hi>Pontificial Prayer,</hi> Joh. 17. 20. 21. <hi>Neither Pray
I for these alone; but for them also, which shall believe on me
through their word,</hi> i. e. to the end of the World; <hi>that
they all may be one, as thou Father art in me, and I in thee,
that they also may be one in us,</hi> than which, there cannot
be greater comforts; and if such are to last to the
Worlds end, the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper must
needs be of the same perpetuity, for from hence flow
the greatest comforts of true Believers, this assuring us,
that as the material Bread, by eating, is united to ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
Bodies, so is Christ united to our Souls, or our Souls
united to him, as Members to their Head; and to
be one with Christ, it such a Treasury of Comforts,
that there is no affliction, no condition so mean, or so
calamitous, but may receive ease and content from this
Consideration; for if I am one with Christ, my Blessed
Redeemer, will be concern'd for me, will take care of
me, will be with me in the Tryals that fall to my share,
will support me under Temptations; assist me with his
Grace, relieve me by his Presence, subdue Satan under
my Feet shortly, will furnish me with Arguments to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist,
will not leave me when I dye, but convey and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
my Soul, where her Head is, that it may be for
ever with her Lord, and will make me partaker of the
same Glories too, which himself is possest of. By this
Sacrament we become one with Christ Jesus, and this
comfort being to attend sincere Christians, while Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
are in the World, the means, whereby that Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is made, must necessarily last as long as Christianity
lasts, <hi>i. e.</hi> to the Day of Judgment.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Lo, I am with you,</hi> saith Christ to his Disciples,
who were Representatives of all future Christian Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations,
that should maintain the purity of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
and Morals, <hi>to the end of the World,</hi> Matth. 28 20.
This is not to be understood of his Bodily Presence or
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:103387:135"/>
Human Nature, for that was to be Translated into his
Father's Kingdom, and with respect to that, he had told
his Followers before, that <hi>they should not have him always
with them,</hi> Matth. 26. 11. And as to his Divine Nature,
though the words may be referr'd to that, yet it is
to be noted, that he spoke these words, as one, <hi>who had
all Power given him in Heaven and in Earth,</hi> v. 18. and
therefore as Mediator, or the promised <hi>Messiah</hi> of the
World; and if he spake these words, as Mediator or
Head of the Church, it must follow, that he meant
them of his being with them, and their Followers to the
World's end, by his Spirit and virtue, and influence in their
observing all things, whatsoever he Commanded them,
as the words immediately preceding do evince; for he
doth not tye his special Presence to a bare function of
Men, as the Romanists falsly infer, but to Obedience;
and as Baptism was one of the things he commanded
them to use and observe, in the Verse before, so the
Lord's Supper and Celebration of it was another; so
that if Christ's Presence be necessary to the Worlds end,
and that Presence be tied to Obedience, and this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
be one of the things he hath commanded, and
in which he must be obey'd, in order to his Gracious
Presence, this Ordinance also must be necessary, and
must needs be kept up to the end of the World.</p>
            <p>4 Christ's Church is to last to the World's end, for
it is for his Church's sake, that the World stands so long
as it doth, as the World was created upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
because God meant to gather a Church out of
the World, out of the foreseen corrupt Mass of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind;
so it is preserved upon that account, even that
the number of those, that shall be saved, may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated;
which great Truth, is, I believe, aim'd at by
the Apostle, <hi>Col. 1. 15, 16, 17, 18.</hi> and to this end, this
Church is said to be so durable and so firm, that the <hi>Gates
of Hell shall not be able to prevail against it,</hi> Matth. 16. 18.
The Devil, we may be confident, will endeavour to
b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tter it to to the very last moment of the World's du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:103387:136"/>
and if, with all his stratagems, and continued
and lasting assaults, he shall not be able to conquer or
to destroy it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it must stand and last as long as those as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saults
do last. The Apostle therefore makes mention
of sincere Christians, that will <hi>be alive at Christ's coming
to Judgment,</hi> 1 Thess. 4. 17. And consequently, the
Church will last till then; and if the Church is to last
to the Worlds end, the Marks of that Church must last
as long. It's true, Holiness of life is one Mark, but
that's not all the Marks the Christ's Church must have.
The Sacraments are Marks too, and Marks whereby it
may be better known, than by Holiness; not but that
Holiness is the principal Ornament of the Church; but
as those that are to joyn themselves unto the Church,
are generally more inquisitive after the Constitutions
and Ordinances of it, and the means whereby that Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
is effected, than after any thing else, so this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
being part of those means, and therefore one
of the necessary Marks, it must last to the end of the
World, as much as the Church it self, and as long as
there is any probability of Mens joyning themselves to
the Church; and by this means Holiness of Life is sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
promoted, as experience sufficiently witnesses. As
Christians in general, so the Church of Christ, or the
respective Societies of Christians professing Christ's Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
and imitation of his life, are compared to <hi>a City
set on a Hill,</hi> and <hi>which cannot be hid,</hi> Mat. 5. 14. Not
that Christ's Church must always appear outwardly
Magnificent and Glorious, thereby to attract the Eyes
of Spectators, no, but that the purity of Doctrine and
sound Preaching of the Word, and the due administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Holy Sacraments, together with innocence
of Life, must make it visible, and this, it may be, under
the greatest persecution, and when a severe Tempest
falls upon her; by these Marks she may still be known;
and if these are her Marks, these Marks must last as
long as the Church it self.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="261" facs="tcp:103387:136"/>
III. The term therefore, to which this Holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is to last, even Chrst's coming to Judgment, may
very justly be taken into consideration in receiving of
the Blessed Eucharist, I hinted so much, <hi>Ch. 1. Fa. 9.</hi>
But must upon this occasion enlarge upon it: For</p>
            <p>1. This consideration will help to encourage us to
Patience under reproaches, Injuries, and Mens unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
dealing with us. It serves to quiet the Soul, to
think that Christ knows my Sufferings, aud the Injuries
that are done me, and sees my Integrity and Innocence,
and will clear me in the last day before the whole
World; What need I resent such an affront, when the
Son of God takes notice of it, and if I am patient under
it, will, in that great day, plead my Cause, set the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
Transgression, if he repents not, before his Eyes,
and confound him; not that I am to wish that confusion
of the offender; but my consideration, that Christ
will actually do it, may promote my contentedness un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that affliction; What need I revile my Persecutors,
when he, for whose sake, I endure that persecution, will
sufficiently vindicate me in that day, for <hi>it is a righteous
thing with God, to recompense Tribulation, to those that trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
you,</hi> saith <hi>St. Paul, 2. Thes. 1. 6, 7, 8.</hi> This Judge will
at last discover, how Men were mistaken in us, how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just
there Censures were, what sinister Constructions
they put upon our Actions, how malicious their Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
were, how unjust the Punishments they inflicted on
us, how inhuman, how contrary to Charity, all their
ill Lauguage was; <hi>He shall bring forth our Righteousness
as the Light; and our Judgment as the Noon-day,</hi> Psal,
37. 6. and this consideration must needs be very effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
to promote Patience.</p>
            <p>2. This Consideration will help to increase our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence,
and arm us against distrust and diffidence, for
if the powers of darkness would fright us from laying
hold on Christ's Merits, because he will be a very se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:103387:137"/>
Judge in the last day, the timerous Christian may
answer thus. True, he will be my Judge, but he hath
promised to be a Father too, to those that fear him:
He'll be my Judge Indeed, but he is a Judge of my Flesh
and of my Bone, and who will have regard to my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities:
He'll be my Judge, but he is my Head withal,
who will be tender of his Members: He'll be my Judge,
but he is a merciful High Priest withal, who will be my
Advocate, and answer the Objections I cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute.
I will cling to his Precepts, I will not wickedly
depart form him, I will express my Love to him in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Obedience, I will dread his Judgments, and make
his Mercy a motive to Purification. I will not give
place to the Devil, I will fight against his Temptations,
I will stand upon my watch, I will not lie asleep in the
Bed of Sin, I will get up if I chance to fall, I will rise
again when I am overtaken in a fault, I will accuse my
self and beg his pardon, I will endeavour to walk wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of the Vocation, wherewith I am called, with all
lowliness and meekness and long-suffering, I will not
take part against him with his Enemies. This is the
work I have resolved upon, according to this Rule I
will walk, and such a Soul, I know, this Gracious Judge
will not cast away nor condemn; what inadvertencies
I may run into, I will not justifie, but strive against
them, and I doubt not, but his Cross will cover them,
while my Heart is sincere, and my Soul is ever toward
him. This Judge will absolve me, he will deal favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
with me, as with a person whom he hath redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
I will look upon the Promises and apply them. He
hath promised, that he will not take away his kindness
utterly, from such as love him; while I live, I will love
him, and I question not, but as severe as he is to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate
and untractable, he will visit me with everlasting
kindness.</p>

               <head>The Preceding Considerations improved. and reduced
to Practise.</head>
               <p>I. O Let us admire the Goodness of God, and his
marvellous care of our everlasting welfare! He
sees, how slippery our Natures are, how fickle, how
mutable, how changeable, how apt to turn from the
Holy Commandment delivered to them, and therefore
he ties us in Bonds, in Covenants, and in Sacraments of
of Virtue, whereof the Lord's Supper is the strongest,
the greatest and most Sacred, and therefore the best
defensative and guard against the encroachments of
Temptations; insomuch, that he, who can break
through this Mound, and will not be kept in by Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
drawn from the Death of Christ, but, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spight
of the Blood of the Covenant, he hath drunk
and sealed his Promise with, will plunge himself into
known sins; that Man's case is desperate, that Man is
truly resolved to be miserable, and will die, though the
Lord Jesus call to him from the Cross, <hi>Live, in thy
Blood, live:</hi> He that can Swear, and Vow to God, in
this Sacrament, vow upon the Body and Blood of Christ,
that he'll be Drunk no more, and Swear no more, and
Lye and Cheat no more, and yet forgets the Oath of
God, that is upon his Soul, and dares fall to his old
Sins again; that Man's last Estate is worse than the first,
and he slights him, by whom he must be saved, despises
him, who alone can make him happy, refuses that
Blood, which alone can cleanse him, undervalues the
only Champion, that can secure him against the Rage
of the roaring Lion, loses and rejects the Prop, which
alone can support him against the wrath of an offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
God, and affronts that Friend, which alone can help
and comfort him in the day of Vengeance.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="264" facs="tcp:103387:138"/>
II. This Sacrament being a standing Ordinance, and
a notable means of Grace, as much as Prayer and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Word of God, it must necessarily follow, that
Men, who look for Grace and Salvation, must make as
great Conscience of this, as of any other; and if they
account it a Sin, to neglect Prayer and hearing the
Word, they must look upon it as sinful too, to neglect
this Ordinance. If this be a means of Salvation, as well
as the rest, he that hopes to be saved, must seriously
make use of this means, else he can have but little hopes
of arriving to the end without the means. Surely, this
Sacrament is a means, whereby you and I must come to
love the Lord <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> a Duty of that consequence,
that he that love him not in sincerity, lies under a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
threatning, and is liable to a dreadful Curse, <hi>1 Cor.
16. 22.</hi> But how shall we ever love him to any purpose,
except we use the means, whereby that Love must be
raised and kindled in our Breast? Doth any Man hope
to thrive in the World, that will not bestir himself, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
active in his profession, and apply himself to La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour?
Does any Man hope ot arrive to Learning and
Scholarship, without Books or Reading? Does any Person
hope to keep himself warm in Winter, that puts on no
Cloaths? Or, was ever any so foolish, as to hope to
come to his Journies end, if he sits still in a Tavern or
Alehouse by the way? If this Sacrament be a means of
obtaining Happiness, will that Happiness fall to our share,
without using the proper means? If thou refusest to come
to this Ordinance, how can God be kind to thee, how
can he visit thee with the Favour he bears to his own
People? How can he wash thee with the Blood of the
Lamb? How can he make thee Blessed, and a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of <hi>Seraphim,</hi> and give thee a right to the Treasury
of Christ's merits, when thou neglectest the means, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
these Mercies must be consigned and applied to thy
Soul? And therefore,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="265" facs="tcp:103387:138"/>
III. How wretched, how sad, must be the case of
that Soul, which neglects to shew forth the Lord's Death,
in this Ordinance, when the Lord shall come to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
When the Son of God shall appear in all his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and the Sinner, who neglected this Holy Sacrament,
shall be brought before him, it will not be an ordinary
fright, the wretch will be in; especially, when the King
of Glory shall accost and ask him, How canst thou
hope to share in my Glory, that didst not think my
Death worth remembring, in the Congregation of my
Saints? How canst thou hope to participate of my Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness,
that wouldst not weep at my bitter Passion?
How canst thou hope to be advanced to my Throne,
who wast ashamed to look upon me hanging on the
Cross? How canst thou hope to enter into thy Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster's
Joy, that would'st not, by lively representations of
my suffering in the Sacrament, I ordained, be melted
in Tears? How canst thou hope for a seat in the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Mansions, where no defiled thing must enter, that
wouldst not cleanse thy self from filthiness? Or how
couldst thou hope to be cleansed, that wouldst not make
use of my Blood to wash thy self? Here none can be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
that were not Holy upon Earth, and how couldst
thou expect to be Holy, that didst neglect the means
which was intended to enrich thy Soul with Holiness?
Such an Address of such a Majestick Person, and to
an offender too, that knows, and cannot but know,
that all this is true, must necessarily strike the Malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
dumb, fill him with horror, and make him cry out,
though too late, <hi>O that my Head were Water,</hi> &amp;c. Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stulations
of displeased Princes with their Servants, that
have acted contrary to their Will, in things of far less
moment, have cast them into Grief and Swoons, and
fatal diseases, and we must needs conclude, that in the
case we speak of, as the Person offended is greater than
the most puissant Prince in the World; and the neglect
greater, than if a Man had neglected to provide for the
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:103387:139"/>
security of a Temporal Kingdom, so the Expostulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
will be more terrible, and the Sinner's Heart, to
whom they shall be spoken, in far greater consternati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>IV. This shews with what temper and disposition we
ought to come to this Holy Table, even with the same
temper we would, or desire to be in, if, within a few
hours, we were sure to be summoned to Judgment: Were
any of you to appear to Morrow Morning before the
Bar of God, and had you all imaginable assurance of it,
that, by such a time, you must certainly attend there,
would you lie or swear, or dissemble, or break out into
a passion, or pray carelesly, or be backward to do good,
or be averse from Holy thoughts and discourses, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I
trow, not; and as you would not appear before the
Judge with an unmortified temper of Mind, so neither
can it be adviseable to appear before him at this Table,
with such a disposition. As the appearing before his
Judgment Seat, would make you call your most serious
Thoughts together, and make you loath the charms, the
inticements, and the alluring temptations and suggestions
of the Flesh, and of the World; so your appearing at
this Table requires the same inclinations; for, as in the
day of Judgment, the King will come forth and behold
the persons cited into that Court, to see, whether they
are qualified for Heaven and Happiness, so in this Feast,
he comes to look upon the Guests, and to see who comes
with a worldly and carnal disposition, and takes as much
notice of the frame and temper of your Hearts, as he
will do in the last day. Here thy great Master comes,
and takes a view of thy Thoughts, Words, Desires, Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
and Actions, whether they proceed from a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of Love and Submission. Happy the Soul that sits
down at this Table with a sense of her duty, and the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and goodness of the Master of the Feast; for such a
Soul anticipates her future bliss, and feels, in some measure,
the sweetness and comfort of the joyful Absolution, which
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:103387:139"/>
shall be pronounced upon her with greater solemnity in
the last day, even this, <hi>Come ye blessed of my Father, receive
the Kingdom,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>O</hi> Thou Eternal Wisdom, who alone knowest what is
best for me, who hast established this Ordinance in thy
Church, and ordained it as a means, whereby thy loving Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
may come, in the unity of the Faith, unto a perfect Man.
It shall be established for ever, as the Moon, and as a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

in the use of it, O Jesu! Thou art the promised Seed, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised

the fruitful Vine, and by the precious Liquor that drops from
thee, innumerable Souls are cherished and refreshed! Thy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred

My Soul doth gather strength, and life from that
perfume. I am the wounded Man that's fallen among Thieves.
O let thy Blood heal me of my Plagues! Thou hast been lifted
up to the Cross, that the Enemy of Mankind might be tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den

been lifted up to draw me after Thee, and to withdraw my
Heart from worldly Desires and Affections. O lift me up
from the Earth, that I may relish the comfort of thy Exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.
Thou wast lifted up, that thou mightest be beheld by
all. O let me look upon Thee, whom I have pierced by my
Sins, that I may mourn for them bitterly. Thy Holy Arms
were stretched out, that thou mightest embrace all that come
unto Thee. I come, Lord! Take me into thy Arms and love
me! O let thy Cross be my security against all my Enemies!
Let thy Wounds be my refuge in the hour of Temptation! Let
that innocent Blood, that dropt from thy Hands and Feet, and
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:103387:140"/>
Side, wash away the spots and stains of my abominable Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
Henceforward my Hands and my Heart shall be lifted
up in Prayer and Praise, and Love, and Devotion. O di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
me, and give me grace to obey thy Directions, and leave
me not till I am past all danger; O see me safe through
the wilderness of this World, that I may for ever Admire
and Adore Thee in thy Everlasting Kingdom. <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <head>The CONTENTS.</head>
               <p>Both good and bad Men frighted witb the thoughts of Eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Drinking unworthily, but the good without just
cause. Wherein unworthy Eating and Drinking doth not
consist, shewn in Thirteen particulars, with the reasons of
the assertion: and wherein it doth consist. The danger of
unworthy Eating and Drinking, proved to lie in making
our selves guilty of the Body and Blood of the Lord. How
Men involve themselves in that guilt, discovered. A
great difference betwixt Receiving unworthily, and being not
worthy to Receive. The great imprudence and Weakness
of those, that are loath to depart with their Sins, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
are unwilling to come, for fear they should make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
guilty of the Death of Christ, and of Damnation.
The impudence and boldness of others, who come to this
Sacrament, receive unworthily, and are not concerned at
their danger. The Joys and Comforts which arise from
Receiving worthyly. The Prayer.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>I. THough from the Premises, the Reader may easily
guess, what is it to Eat and Drink unworthyly,
and though in <hi>Ch. 4.</hi> some general notions concerning
it have been laid down, yet since it is a point, which
frights, not only bad Men, but even some of those, who
are otherwise piously inclin'd, from coming to the Lord's
Table, it will be necessary to give a distinct explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:103387:141"/>
it, that neither the bad may think, they gain any
thing by abstaining, nor the good be discouraged from
coming. As bad Men have no sense of Spiritual things,
which makes them live merrily in neglect of command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Duties, so not a few of those, whose hearts are ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
are apt to discompose their minds with needless
scruples, whereby they too often deprive themselves of
the comforts, they might reap from God's Ordinances,
and besides, expose themselves to strong Temptations of
the Devil, who takes pleasure to see good Men in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion,
hoping, that one time or other they may fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his net, and when they know not how to extricate
themselves out of their Labyrinths, will shake of the Yoak
of all Religion, and become his Votaries, run into the
the other extream, and turn either careless or Prophane.
To prevent these and other dangers, it will be conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
to discourse of this Eating, and Drinking unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily,
<hi>first,</hi> Negatively, what it is not, and <hi>secondly,</hi> what
it is, and wherein the sin consists. And therefore.</p>
            <p>II. To Eat and Drink unworthily, is not, <hi>1. To Eat and
Drink at this Table with a weak Faith.</hi> By a weak Faith
I mean such a belief of the truth, and necessity of the
things commanded in the Gospel of our Lord Jesus
Christ, as makes the Soul ready, and willing to do the
things, required of her, but is attended with great fears,
and doubts, with wavering, and inconstancy; and this
weakness proceeds not so much from want of will
to submit to Christ, as from want of understanding ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the extent of the Grace of God, or the nature of
the Gospel of peace, or the design of God in his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences,
or the Latitude of true Christian Liberty, which
defect must needs cause great mistrusts of our safety,
danger of being scandaliz'd with little things, and unsted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diness
in Holy Duties, as we see, <hi>Rom. 14. 1, 2. &amp;c.</hi>
yet this weakness of Faith doth not make a Man an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy receiver.</p>
            <p>1. Because Christ is willing to receive such into favour,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:103387:141"/>
and he express'd this willingness in his kind behaviour
to the Man, we read of <hi>Mark 9. 22.</hi> Who believed
indeed, but waveringly, and soon after cryed out, and
said, with Tears in his Eyes, <hi>Lord! I believe, help thou my
unbelief.</hi> The Disciples of our Lord, upon their first
adhering to him, were at the best but weak in Faith,
and therefore Christ calls to them so often, <hi>O ye of little
Faith,</hi> yet he doth not therefore reject them. He cherish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
the very Seeds of Faith, and when it is no bigger
than a grain of Muster-Seed, he makes much of it.
Though the Branches of it be but tender, yet he doth
not Root up the Tree, or Command the <hi>Husbandman
to cut it down, lest it should cumber the Ground, or throw it
into the Fire:</hi> To which purpose there is an Excellent
Character given of him, <hi>Esa. 40. 11. He shall feed his
Flock like a Shepherd, and gather the Lambs with his Arms,
and carry them in his Bosom, and shall gently lead those that
are with young.</hi> There are Lambs in his Flock as well
as Sheep, and as these two require various management,
so both may be confident of his tenderness. All Stars
do not shine alike, yet even those, that give not so great
a brightness, shall be preserved, as well as the greater
Luminaries. Love is an acceptable present to him, and
though in some, like fire under green Wood, it burns but
dimly, yet he'll quench it no more, than he will the
more blazing Flames. But then when I say, he will
not frown on those, that are weak in Faith, I do not
mean, such as have no saving, no working Faith, and as
refuse to work the work of God, such are Infidels, not
Men weak in Faith. Weakness of Faith supposes rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diness
to good works, but the various doubts, which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
it, cause this weakness. That there are such Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
<hi>as Children in Grace,</hi> St. <hi>John</hi> assures us, <hi>1 John 2. 12.</hi>
Yet even <hi>their Sins, he is willing to forgive for his Names
sake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Because this Sacrament was instituted for the
strengthening of our Faith. The weak in Faith are call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and invited to it, that they may grow more robust,
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:103387:142"/>
and lively; and to this end Christ offers himself in this
Ordinance as Spiritual Meat and Drink, that living up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him, and feeding upon him, we may be brought up
to greater perfection; that our Souls may follow him with
greater alacrity, Grace may become more active, and
Faith more solid, and more defecated from Hypocrisie;
And as here we contemplate Christ, so we behold his
extraordinary Faith in God, that seeing it, it may give
us courage to tread in his steps. His Father's promises
to him, as Man, and Mediator, were great, and large,
and extensive. God had promis'd, that he should be
King of Heaven and Earth, that all Power should be
put into his hand, and that he should be as it were, his
Lieutenant-General; <hi>Ask of me,</hi> saith he, <hi>Psal. 2. 8. And
I shall give thee the Heathen for thine Inheritance, and the
uttermost parts of the Earth for thy possession, thou shalt break
them with a rod of Iron, thou shalt dash them in pieces like
a Potter's Vessel.</hi> There was little probability of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of these promises, when he was mocked, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rided,
scourged, beaten, bruis'd and crucified, when he
was made liker a Worm than a Man, the reproach of
Men, and despised of the People, when all that saw him
laugh'd him to scorn, and did shoot out their Lips, and
shook their Heads, saying, He trusted in the Lord, that
he would deliver him, let him deliver him, seeing he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted
in him, when many Bulls compass'd him, and strong
Bulls of Basan did beset him round, when they gaped upon
him with their Mouths, as ravening and roaring Lions,
when he was poured out like Water, and all his Bones were
out of joynt, when his Heart was like Wax, and melted in
the midst of his Bowels, when his strength was dried
up like a Pot-sherd, and his Tongue cleav'd to his Jaws,
and he was brought into the dust of Death, when Dogs
compass'd him, and the Assemblies of the wicked did
enclose them, when they pierc'd his hands and his Feet,
as <hi>David</hi> describes his misery,<note place="margin">Psal. 22. 6, 7. 8, 9. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> yet in the
midst of all these disasters, he believ'd the
promise of his Father would be punctual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fulfill'd, which makes the Author of the Epistle to
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:103387:142"/>
the <hi>Hebrews</hi> say, that for the Glory set before him,
the promis'd Glory, <hi>He endured the Cross, and despised
the shame,</hi> Heb. 12. 2. His Faith bore him up under all
these Floods of ungodliness, so that he is not only the
Author, and Finisher, but also the example of our Faith,
an Example set before us in this Holy Sacrament, that
we may light our Candle by his Fire, strengthen our
Faith by his Plerophory and Confidence, and if this
be the end of his being represented in this Ordinance,
the weak in Faith cannot be excluded, nor can weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Faith make a Person an unworthy Receiver.</p>
            <p>Nor, <hi>Is it want of a total purity, or of freedom from
all Sin, that makes a Person an unworthy Receiver;</hi> It's
true, the Gospel commands those, who mean to receive
worthily, to purge out <hi>the old leaven,</hi> 1 Cor. 5. 7. <hi>And
putting off the old Man with all his deceitful Lusts,</hi> Eph. 4.
22. and whoever hopes to be partaker of the benefits of
Christ's death, his purpose at least must be serious, and
unfeigned, without partiality, and Hypocrisie, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
all Love and Affection to a sinful Life; but still
there is a great difference betwixt destroying the Reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
power of Sin, and being free from all Sin; of the
former, the aforesaid passages must be understood, and
the worthy Communicant must in sober sadness mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie,
and resolve to mortifie the Imperial Power of Sin
in his Soul, so as not willingly and wilfully to yield un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the sinful dictates of the Flesh, or of the World, but
to prefer his God, and what he requires, before his own
Temporal advantages: But from thence it follows not
that the worthy Receiver must not be so much as sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to errors, and inadvertencies, and falls by surprize,
and before he can well recollect himself; and therefore
the want of such spotlesness, is not it, that makes a Man
Eat and Drink unworthily at this Table.</p>
            <p>1. Because this Feast is not instituted for Angels, but
for Men. Angels have no need of such encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

to Virtue, they being determin'd to Goodness.
Were Men free from all Sin, they would not stand in
need of this Ordinance, which is intended to make sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Men good, and good Men better. <hi>Those that are
whole need no Physician, but the sick;</hi> and as Christ is the
Physician in this Sacrament, so they are the sick he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites
to come to him. The best Man that is, though he
labours under no Chronical distemper, yet he hath ail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
still, and infirmities about him, which want the
Physicians hand, and Medicine, which is here most Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously
tendr'd to him.<note place="margin">

               </note> The Scripture of the
Old Testament calls Man <hi>Enosh, infirm, weak,

state of health than Hypocrites and grosser Sinners, yet
who, even of the strictest mortals can say, <hi>I have made
my heart clean,</hi> so that no spot shall be seen there? This
Sacrament therefore being ordained for Men, it must
be granted, that it is ordain'd for sinful Men, not to
encourage them in Sin, but to make them hate it, not
only the bigger stains, but even the relicts of it, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
in the Regenerate. To this end Christ's Ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
and exquisite Torments are set before us in this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
the Torments, I mean, our Sins, inflicted and
brought upon him, that that sight may terrifie us, and
fill us with abhorrency of that, which hath made the
Son of God so miserable.</p>
            <p>2. No Sinners are excluded from this Sacrament,
that are willing to reform their Hearts, and Lives.
Those that with <hi>Ephraim, will have no more to do with
Idols, take with them words, and turn unto the Lord,</hi> say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>Take away<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all our iniquity, and receive us Graciously,
so will we render the Calves of our Lips;</hi> Ashur <hi>shall not
save us, neither will we say any more to the works of our
hands, ye are our Gods,</hi> as it is said, <hi>Hos. 14. 2, 3.</hi> Such
are call'd by the great Shepherd of the Sheep, not stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born
Sinners, but penitent Sinners; not obstinate Sinners,
but tractable Sinners; not Sinners that will be miserable,
but Sinners, that long to be deliver'd from their misery;
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:103387:144"/>
not Sinners that are resolved to walk on in the Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their Hearts, but Sinners who are ambitious of a
clean Heart, and of a new Spirit; not Sinners that will
keep their Sins, but Sinners that are weary of them;
not Sinners who still find Sweetness in their Sins, but Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
who are sensible of the Bitterness of them; not Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
who make a Mock of Sin, but Sinners to whom Sin
is a Grief and Burthen; not Sinners that make a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
with Hell, but Sinners that break that Covenant, to
be the Lord's Free-men: So that, not to be free from
Sin, is not to eat and drink unworthily.</p>
            <p>Nor, 3. <hi>Doth all Dulness in holy Duties make a Man an
unworthy Receiver.</hi> There is a Dulness, indeed, which
proceeds from an Aversion to the holy Commands of
the Gospel, from a voluntary Stupidity of Mind, and
want of Relish of Spiritual Things; and this, without
all peradventure, is very prejudicial to the Soul, and a
bad Preparative for the Communion, and no small Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment
to the Grace of God. But there is a Dulness,
which is the Result of Faintness, when the Spirits are
spent, and the first Intenseness of the Mind is worn out:
In such Cases, a Dulness and Deadness may easily rise,
but much against our Wills, and, to be sure, without
our Approbation. Nor is this Dulness to be seen only
in Temporal Concerns, but even in Spiritual Duties
and Devotions. When the first Heat of Devotion in
the Morning is over, and the Spirits of the Blood,
which were the Porters that serv'd to carry up our
Prayers on high, are in some measure tired, the Soul
that, after this, applies her self to the holy Communion
in the publick Congregation. may want that Liveliness
and Briskness of Thought, Desire and Affection, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the first Flames, which were strongest in the
Morning when we rose, are spent. Now, This Dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
doth not make a Person an unworthy Receiver:
And the same Judgment we are to make of that Dulness
which rises from natural Imperfections and Sicknesses,
incident to good Men, as well as bad; such as Lethar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:103387:145"/>
Dropsies, Scurvy, Consumption, and other Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
which are either beginning, or are come to a
considerable Strength: Neither the one, nor the other,
if they seize us at the Communion, do make us unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Receivers.</p>
            <p>1. Because God doth not judge of us so much by the
present Liveliness and Activity of our Spirits, as by the
Sincerity of our Souls. Where the Soul is bent to please
God, doth not regard Iniquity in her Heart, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
so much of Fear upon her Mind, as makes her,
that she would not offend God wilfully, though it were
to gain the Kingdoms of the World; is willing to be
better inform'd, to have her Errours discovered to her;
is desirous to be strengthen'd in the Inward Man; is
still ready to embrace any Good, suggested to her from
the Word of God, or the Ministers of his Ordinances;
there the Soul hath reason to bless God for the Sincerity
that is in her, and to believe, that, notwithstanding her
present accidental or involuntary Dulness, he will meet
her in this Sacrament with a favourable Aspect, bid her
welcome, and give her the glorious Blessings she expects
in the Holy Communion: <hi>For, if there be first a willing
Mind, it is accepted according to what a Man hath, and not
according to what he hath not,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>2 Cor. 8.
12.</hi> If that Soul finds a present Dulness, is willing to be
rid of it, is so far from being pleased with it, that it is
her Burthen, would be more lively in her Desires if she
could; there God will certainly spread open his Arms
to her, and receive her.</p>
            <p>2. Because God rejects no Person for what he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
help. I know, this is the common Plea of all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted
Sinners: When they are exhorted to close
with God, and to cashier their known Sins, or are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
for continuing in them; the String they harp
upon is this, That they cannot help it. But, not to
mention that, by thinking or saying so, they make God
a Lyar, who saith, they can help it if they will use the
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:103387:145"/>
Means the Holy Ghost prescribes; 'tis evident to all
wise and considerate Men, that this pretence of Impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility
is nothing but Resolution and Obstinacy to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
in the State they are in. And therefore, when I
say, that God rejects none for what they cannot help,
the meaning is, for what he sees and knows they cannot
help: As a Christian who, upon the account of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientiousness,
is cast into a Prison or Dungeon, God
will not reject him for not frequenting the publick Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances;
so here, for the Dulness that seizes upon pious
Christians in their holy Performances, God will not
withdraw his Kindness; especially where he sees that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the faintness of their Spirits, or the prevailing Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempers
in their Bodies, baffle all their repeated and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iterated
strivings to be lively and affectionate in their
Addresses to God, and particularly in the holy Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.
In this case, God regards rather the brave Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the honest Believer, and his swimming against
the Stream, than the Want of what he desires: Nor will
he condemn him for not doing that which he would do,
and cannot. And the same is to be said of those blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Suggestions I mention'd, and gave an Account of,
<hi>Chap. 14. Sect. 7. ¶. 4.</hi> They being things which no
Man can help, (for, Who can hinder the Devil from
tempting him?) if detested, they cannot make the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
that resists and abhors them an unworthy Receiver,
though they should fly or dart into his Mind in the Act
of Receiving. All that can be done to them, is, to abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
them when they come in; and though they may
be the Devil's Sin, who frames these fiery Darts, and
shapes them on his Anvil, yet they are not Sin to the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulted
Person, who saith, <hi>I renounce the Devil, and all
his Works.</hi> There is no fighting of them with Swords
and Spears; they are not to be cut in pieces with Knives
or Axes; are not to be expelled by Forks and Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons:
Resistance, and Detestation, and Prayer, and
Declarations of our contrary Belief, is all the Force that
can be used; and while this is done, the Soul is safe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
all those Skirmishes of the Enemy. Nay, Who can
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:103387:146"/>
promise themselves a greater Welcome to this Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
than those that resist Temptation? Resistance is
a Vertue, and a Sign the Soul is touched with a Sense
of God: 'Tis a Character of Grace, and Abhorrency
of Evil, a Fruit of the Spirit; and those that are led by
the Spirit, cannot but be worthy Communicants. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
Temptation we meet withal, while we consent
not, we preserve the Safety of our Souls: And though
it is true, that these blasphemous Suggestions come in
sometimes so thick, and so fast, and make those strange
Impressions on the Mind, that the Patient cannot well
tell whether he consents to them, or not; yet it being,
in a manner, impossible we should consent to things our
very Nature abhors, and which we know to be against
the common Principles riveted in our Souls, he that feels
them, hath reason to believe that he consents not to
them, though for the present they stun him: However,
when he recovers out of his present Fright and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sternation,
if deliberately he rejects them, 'tis enough:
And though they should follow him Twenty Years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
yet, if he resist and detest them Twenty Years
together, they cannot make him an unworthy Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicant.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Impossibility of forgetting an Injury doth not make a
Man an unworthy Receiver.</hi> By not being able to forget
an Injury, I mean, not being able so to put the Matter
of Fact out of our Minds, that we shall never think of
it, or remember that such an Injury was done unto us.
'Tis true, the uncharitable Man, as he is a Stranger to
Christ's Religion, so it cannot be supposed that he will
meet with any kind Entertainment at the Lord's Table:
And whoever would not go away empty from this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance,
must from his Heart forgive the Offender who
hath either wronged or disparaged him, or wounded his
good Name: Nay, so far he must forget the Injury too,
as not to exercise Revenge when it lies in his power;
nor must he remember it with Wrath and Passion, or
ill Language, or with an Intent or Resolution to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:103387:146"/>
from him the charitable Offices of Humanity, or
with renewing his Grudge and Hatred to him, or with
making the Remembrance an Argument and Motive to
desist from the Good he intended him; for he must not
forget to do good to Enemies, and such as have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spitefully
used him. And though no Person is, by the
Law of the Gospel, obliged to make a Person who hath
been notoriously <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>alse and treacherous to him, his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som-friend
and Familiar, or to trust him again without
Fear or Suspicion, except he sees, and is sensible of the
Offender's sincere Repentance; yet still the Injury must
be so far forgotten, as not to deny or refuse to help the
Offender in things we can conveniently and easily serve
him in. But to think sometimes of the Injury done to
us, with Pity and Compassion to the Offender; or not
to be able so to extinguish the Thoughts of it, that it
shall not so much as beat upon our Minds again: This,
I say, doth not make a Person an unworthy Receiver.</p>
            <p>1. Because God doth not intend the Destruction of
our Faculties, whereof Memory is one: Never to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
an Injury, or not to be able so much as barely
to think of it, supposes Destruction of our Memory. All
that God intends in our Reformation, is the Destruction
of our evil Qualities, and the Irregularities of our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties.
His Design is not to annihilate our Minds, but
the evil Thoughts that are apt to take up their Lodging
there<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not to abolish our Wills, but the Perverseness
and Stubbornness that cleaves to them; and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
not to destroy our Memories, but the Revenge, and
Hatred, and Malice, and secret Grudges, which are apt
to harbour there. Even then, when God presses upon
us the Destruction of the Body of Sin, it is not that we
are to kill our Natural Bodies, but the Mass of Corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
that lies in them. And though <hi>Christ</hi> bids us <hi>cut off
our Right Hand,</hi> yet he means no more than that the Sins
should be resected which cleave to it: And that is the
the meaning too of <hi>pulling out the Eye;</hi> i. e. <hi>the evil Looks,</hi>
and <hi>unchaste Desires,</hi> and <hi>foolish Concupiscences,</hi> which are
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:103387:147"/>
apt to incorporate with that Organ. So that he who
can so far rase an Injury out of his Memory, as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
his own ill-Will, his ill Designs, his evil Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to the Offender, which are written there; his not
being able totally to obliterate that such a thing was ever
done to him, need not make him afraid that he shall be
an unworthy Receiver in this Ordinance.</p>
            <p>2. This Sacrament will help us totally to forget the
Injury; or, if not totally to forget it, yet totally to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
requiting the Offender according to his Demerits;
and so to forget it, that the Remembrance shall cause
no Commotion, no Disorder, no Tumults, no Risings
in our Minds. For here we are told, and here we are
made to see, how God, that hath far greater reason to
stand upon Points of Honour than any Mortal Man,
freely and graciously forgives and forgets our Sins and
Offences against him, in the Blood of his Son, blots
them out like a thick Cloud, and, notwithstanding all
the Wrong we have offer'd to him, is willing to pass
by the foulest Trespasses; willing to open his Gates to
us, though we have lock'd our selves out; willing to
vouchsafe us his Smiles again, though we have forfeited
the Light of his Favour; and willing to adopt us for his
Children, though we have lived like Prodigals; which
must needs be a great help to make us forget the Wrongs
we have suffer'd from unreasonable Men: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
he that is not able totally to forget, ought to come,
that by this great Example of God's forgetting his Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
he may be persuaded totally to forget his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour's
Trespasses.</p>
            <p>5. <hi>Worldly Business, either a Day or Week before a Man
receives, doth not make him as unworthy Receiver.</hi> By
Worldly Business,<note place="margin">See Chap. 15. Sect. 5. ¶. 1.</note> I mean lawful Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
not Playing, or Drinking, or go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Stage Plays, or mis-spending our
Time, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but such Business as appertains to an honest
and lawful Calling, or Business considered abstractedly
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:103387:147"/>
from the evil Concomitants of it: For lawful Business is
one thing, and the way of managing of it is another.
A Man may manage even his lawful Business sinfully,
and run himself into Danger; but following it without
Sin, as it may happen that the Day or Week before he
may have greater Occasions than ordinary to look after
it, as this need not hinder him from an holy Life, so
neither can it be a just Impediment to his Receiving
worthily.</p>
            <p>1. Because it is our Duty to mind it on such Days of
the Week as God hath permitted us to work in; which
makes the Apostle enjoyn us to <hi>do our own Business,</hi> and
<hi>work with our Hands,</hi> without making any distinction in
Days, <hi>1 Thes. 4. 11.</hi> 'Tis true, where publick Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
either Civil or Ecclesiastical, appoints a Day in the
Week to be kept holy, or a Festival, or a Fast, or where
a Person, by a Vow, hath consecrated a certain Day in
the Week, to spend it entirely in religious Duties, there
Working ought to be forborn; for Magistrates ought to
be obeyed, and a Vow doth bind the Soul. But set
aside these Cases, the Command to work extends to all
Days, except the <hi>Lord's Day;</hi> and therefore, he that is
to receive the holy Sacrament on the <hi>Lord's Day,</hi> is not
necessarily obliged to abstain from minding his lawful
Business the Day before.</p>
            <p>2. Lawful Business doth not, need not hinder a Man
from preserving holy Thoughts, holy Desires, and holy
Affections, if his Soul were acquainted with any before.
A good Man, in the midst of his lawful Business, will
keep God in his Eye, that he may not sin against him,
that he may do what is just and righteous in his sight,
and that at Night he may reap Comfort from a Review
of his Actions of the Day. Lawful Business is consistent
with watching against Temptations, and keeping our
selves unspotted from the Pollutions of the World; and
this St. <hi>James</hi> calls <hi>Pure Religion, Jam. 1. 27.</hi> And if this
pure Religion be joyned with our Business, I do not see
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:103387:148"/>
how our lawful Business, if we mind it the Day or Week
before, can make us unworthy Receivers.</p>
            <p>3. No Man hath so much lawful Business, but, if he
pleases, he may find time to retire, and enter into his
Closet, and walk with God. Where a Man pretends
that his lawful Business allows him no time for Devotion,
'tis to be feared he either tells a Lye, or he manages his
lawful Business very ill, or imitates the carnal Sort of
Mankind, who, when they have spent the whole Day,
or the greatest part of the Day, in Fooleries, and need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
Business, give out, they have no time, and can find
no time for God's Service. A Conscientious Man, if
he be really so, will take heed how he conforms to the
World in this particular; and if he manages his Affairs
with discretion, I question not but he will find time to
ask his Heart what it is that is nearest to him, whether
God, or the World; what his chief Aim or Design is,
whether to be rich, or to be good? And as he will find
time to ask himself such Questions, so he will find time
for pious Exercises, whereby his Soul may be brought
to a serious Sense of the Mystery proposed in this holy
Sacrament; and if he do so, his lawful Worldly Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
the Day or Week before, as it need not discourage
him from coming to this holy Table, so it need not fill
his Head with Doubts and Fears, that coming to it, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
been engaged in much Business the Day before,
will make him an unworthy Communicant.</p>
            <p>6. <hi>Worldly, Crosses, Troubles and Disappointments do not
make a Man an unworthy Receiver.</hi> I do not deny but
Crosses and Troubles of the World, if they fill the Mind
with Torments, and mistrustful Cares; if they depress
the Understanding, make it lie groveling on the Earth,
and mind little else but Second Causes; if they possess
the Soul with despairing Thoughts, drive it into Discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
draw it away from Heaven, render the Promises
of God insipid to her, and do so far prevail with her
that the future Joys, and the Bliss of the other World,
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:103387:148"/>
are insignificant things to her; these Effects do not look
very amiable in the sight of God, are no very tempting
Objects to the Son of God, the Master of this Spiritual
Feast; and are so far from being Allurements of his
Blessing, that they are like to procure his Curse: But
I consider Worldly Crosses, as abstracted from all these
Abuses; and, as such, they cannot make a Person eat
and drink unworthily.</p>
            <p>1. Because, What were the Communicants under the
first Persecutions of the Church, but so many afflicted,
distressed, troubled, and evil-entreated Christians?
Their Crosses were great, their Afflictions heavy, and
their Pressures grievous; they were in daily danger of
losing, not only their nearest Relatives, but their Lands,
Houses, Possessions; they were hunted, pursued, dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
from their Dwellings; the Heathens were set against
them; the <hi>Jews</hi> were their Enemies; they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached;
they were made Spectacles to Angels, and
to Men; they were tormented; they were committed
to Wild Beasts; they were harassed, beaten, bruised;
they were wrongfully accused of Treason, of Sedition,
of Atheism, of murthering their Children, of promis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous
Copulations, and of other Crimes; they were ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
branded with odious Names; they were charged
with being the Causes of Plagues, Inundations, Famine,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet nothing of these discouraged them from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to this Table; they came to it to chuse, and thought
themselves the fitter to approach, because they were
made conformable to <hi>Christ</hi> in his Afflictions.</p>
            <p>2. A Man may have such Crosses, and yet be very
Conscientious. 'Tis far from being impossible to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted,
and yet good; miserable, and yet serious; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute,
and yet religious; hated, and yet a Lover of
God. In the midst of the greatest Troubles, a Man
may put his Confidence in God, praise him for his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
rejoyce in him, because he hath promised him E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Life; keep his Tongue from Evil, and his Lips
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:103387:149"/>
from speaking Guile; take occasion from his Troubles,
to consider the Emptiness of Sublunary Comforts, the
Permanency of Spiritual Consolations, the Sweetness of
God's Favour, the Beauty of God's Providences, the
Wisdom of his Dispensations, the Happiness of <hi>Lazarus</hi>
in the midst of all his Sores and Boyls, the Designs of
God to make him humble and patient, and to fit him
for Eternal Happiness. And where a Person makes this
use of his Afflictions, there is nothing can dispose him
better for receiving the holy Communion.</p>
            <p>3. This Sacrament is an excellent Help to bear our
Troubles and Misfortunes with a contented and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Mind: For here the Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> is represented to us
as dumb under all Reproaches, unmoved at all the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Language that is given him, silent under the Rage of
Enemies, meek<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>under the foulest Accusations, giving
his Back to the Smiter, and not opening his Mouth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Scorns and Derisions of his Adversaries, conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
under all his Losses, courageous under all the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies
that False Witnesses invent against him, satisfied
with the Will of God, bearing his Cross without mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring,
answering calmly to his Oppressors, patient
under his Scourges, ready to do good to those that came
to apprehend him. And is not this a powerful Motive
to bear what Providence thinks fit to inflict upon us?
And therefore, Crosses and Worldly Troubles, separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from the ill Management of them, cannot make a
Person an unworthy Receiver. Where Men storm and
fret, and burn with Revenge under an Affliction, will
be their own Carvers, will be vindicated their own way,
that way that Flesh and Blood suggests, and will rid
themselves of their Trouble by unlawful Means; these,
indeed, if they receive, they eat and drink unworthily:
But that is not a necessary Effect of the Affliction, but
a Product rather of their Wickedness and Carnality,
which, instead of being cherished, must be cut off, and
mortified.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="285" facs="tcp:103387:149"/>
7. A Man's having formerly received unworthily, and
coming again afterwards to the holy Sacrament, with a great
Sense and Abhorrency of his former unworthy Receiving, <hi>doth
not make him an unworthy Receiver. For,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. If it did, we might as well say, that he who hath
sinned grievously, cannot safely venture on a true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance:
To have done ill, is no Bar to a sincere Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
but a Motive to it; and though the Sin be never
so great, yet if he can so order and manage his Remorse,
that it may be hearty, kindly, and attended with a real
and universal Change of Life, and Love to Goodness,
he hath no reason to despair of Pardon; this being the
great Comfort of the Gospel, <hi>That Repentance and Remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of Sins should be preached in the Name of Jesus, among
all Nations, beginning at</hi> Jerusalem, saith our Saviour, <hi>Luk.
24. 47.</hi> And that which will illustrate this Saying, is
the Story in <hi>Sophronius,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sophr. vel Mosch. in prat. Spir. cap. 31.</note> of two old Men
of exemplary Holiness, who travelling,
and tired with their Journey, the Heat
of the Weather also being great, they retired into a Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
or Barn that was hard by; where thinking to be pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate,
contrary to Expectation, they found three Young
Men caressing of an Harlot: However, not discoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
with that ill Company, they retired into a Corner
of the Barn, and there read the holy <hi>Evangelists.</hi> The
Harlot, at once surprized and charmed with their Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riousness,
drew near, and sat down by one of them,
who thrust her away, wondering at her Confidence to
joyn her self to their Company: To which she replied,
<hi>I beseech you, thrust me not away from you; for though I am
laden with Sin, and have made a very ill use of the Means of
Grace, yet I find not that Christ drove the Harlot from him,
that kneeled down at his Feet.</hi> One of them soon answer'd
her, saying, <hi>That Harlot whom Christ received, did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
an Harlot.</hi> To which she instantly made this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
<hi>From this time forward, I seriously renounce this evil
Life of mine, and nothing shall divert me from the greatest
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:103387:150"/>
Severities of Religion.</hi> She was as good as her word, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
Instructions and Comfort from the old Men, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
their directions, and retired from the World:
And therefore if a Man have received unworthily, and
truly laments and deplores his former presumption, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
himself to newness of Life, and is transform'd into
a Christian temper, he may lawfully return to that Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and there receive and expect remission of Sin, where
formerly he swallow'd Death and Poyson; and tho' his
Guilt hath been of a very deep Dye, yet Repentance,
if unfeigned, hath that Almighty Power, that it can
make <hi>Ethiopians</hi> white, and Deformity amiable: But
then,</p>
            <p>2. He that hath received unworthily, and comes to be
sensible of it, and thereupon Receives again; had need
watch, and take heed, he do not return to his former
folly, for fear God be tired with pardoning, and speak
Peace no more, <hi>for he will speak Peace unto his People, and
to his Saints, but let them not return again unto folly,</hi> saith
the <hi>Psalmist, Psal. 85. 8.</hi> Implying, that the Peace of
God is not to be had at all times, especially after fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
contempt. There are offences which provoke
God to say, as it is, <hi>Judg. 10. 13. Ye have forsaken me,
wherefore I will deliver you no more,</hi> The Peace of God is
no trifle, which Men may play withal, and command
when they please; God makes another-guise account of
it, where it is lost, it's not a very easie matter to regain it;
and so much we may guess at from the examples of good
Men, who, through strong temptations, have fall'n in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
any great Sin; It hath cost them much labour and
pain to recover, and God hath on purpose with-held
his Peace from their Souls a long time, that they might
learn how to prize and preserve it with greater care, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
its return: It's folly to think, God is such a one, as
we our selves, or that he is as willing to part with Peace,
and Pardon, as we to have it, when ever we stand in
need of it. As it is one of the greatest comforts Man
can expect of God, so he expects it should be managed
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:103387:150"/>
with prudence and cautionsness. It doth not lie like a
drug upon his hand, which he is willing to be rid of,
whenever we are pleased to take it off: If we know not
how to prize it, there are those that will, and by those
few God can be glorified, while others bewail the loss
of it in outward darkness.</p>
            <p>8. A Law-suit that is depending, doth not necessarily
make a Man an unworthy Receiver.</p>
            <p>1. If the Law-suit be begun for small things and trifles,
such as any wise and impartial considerate Man, were
he consulted with, would judge to be trivial, and of
no great importance; or if it be commenced upon
the account of Revenge; or against persons who are
known to be insolvent, only to have our Will and base
humour gratified, and to have the satisfaction of throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Indigent wretch into Prison, or if it be mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
in a sinful way, with opprobrious Language, and
bitter Expressions, false Accusations, suborning of Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
against the adverse Party; or with harbouring
Malice, Hatred, or secret Grudges in our Hearts, against
him; and we feel no Godly sorrow for it, <hi>i. e.</hi> Do not
resolutely, upon the account of Christian Love and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
quit and renounce these evil companions of our
Souls, and yet come to this Holy Table; there, without
all peradventure, we Eat and Drink unworthily, because
we Eat and Drink without consideration of the Love of
Christ, and the conditions of the Pardon, we expect
by his Cross; and the dangerous Meat we have swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd,
is not vomited up but lies raw and undigested in
our Bowels, which must needs be a bar to the Grace
and Mercy of God, and our own Comfort. But then,</p>
            <p>2. If the Law-suit be commenc'd, upon the account
of something that's of great importance, either to our
Selves or Friends, or Heirs; if there be no other way to
come to our Right, and ordinary references will not
do; if it be merely to obtain reparation for the Dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:103387:151"/>
we have sustain'd, or are like to sustain; if these
Suits be carried on with Meekness, with Justice, with
using honest and lawful Means, with Candor and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity,
without addition of <hi>the hidden things of disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty,</hi>
without supplanting the other Party, without
wounding his good Name, or mis-representing things of
his side, without catching at Bulrushes, or taking advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
of his infirmities; if the ground and motive of the
Enterprize be only, that our Neighbor, and we, may
both be satisfied in the case, that's in dispute; if the Suit
be managed without Pride or Passion, with Gentleness
and continuation of our wonted Civility, Kindness and
Charity to the Party we are at Law with, and do not
upon that account, forbear the Respect we formerly
shew'd him. In this case our coming cannot be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial
to worthy Receiving; for as it is impossible,
but Contests and Disputes will arise, and the Law of
Nature requires, that Justice should be done to every
Man; it must necessarily follow, that there must be
Courts of Judicature, and that God not only permits,
but appoints them too. It's certain, that God, in the
Jewish <hi>Theocracy,</hi> ordain'd such Courts; and human So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties
not being able to subsist without them, natural
Equity requires, there should be such things in all civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liz'd
Nations, whereby Contests may be decided, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies
ended, Differences superseded, and every Man
come to his Right; and tho' <hi>St. Paul, 1 Cor. 6. 1, 2.
&amp;c.</hi> finds fault with the <hi>Corinthians</hi> for going to Law;
yet the reason why he blames them, is, partly because
they quarrell'd about smaller Matters; partly because in
their Law-Suits, they forgot the Law of Charity; and
partly because they did all this before Infidels and Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters,
and would not refer their Disputes to indifferent
Men that were Christians, but impleaded one another
before Judges that were Pagans; whereby the Gospel
was reproach'd, Religion blasphem'd, and Christianity
traduc'd, and strangers were induced to believe, that
the Gospel gave Men no better Principles, than either
<hi>Indaism</hi> or <hi>Heathenism,</hi> nor rais'd them to higher Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:103387:151"/>
than what Nature and Custom had taught others,
that were not of that Religion: Nay, it's evident from
the whole Discourse, that he allows their going to Law
<hi>before the Saints,</hi> as it is said, <hi>v. 1. i. e.</hi> before <hi>Christians,</hi>
only that was too mild a course, they thought; that
was not the way to triumph over the Adversary, or to
have him punish'd, and be made a publick Example;
and this ill Nature St. <hi>Paul</hi> reproves, and justly forbids,
and commands them, rather than do so, to suffer them
selves to be defrauded, and to take wrong, <hi>v. 7. Christ</hi>
indeed, <hi>Matth. 5. 40.</hi> in that saying, <hi>If any Man will
sue thee at the Law, and take away thy Coat, let him have
thy Cloak also</hi> seems to condemn all going to Law; but
the very expression he uses, shews, that he restrains the
unlawfulness of it to certain cases; <hi>i. e.</hi> if the matter be
small, inconsiderable, and of no great moment, such as a
Coat, or a Cloak, and other things of the same nature;
and indeed it is a very lamentable case, to see how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of our People sue their Neighbors for pitiful Debts,
and cast them into Prison; for proof of which, a Man
need go no farther than the <hi>Marshalsea,</hi> a thing not to
be thought of without horror. Besides, Christ, in the
foregoing Verses of that Chapter, enters into a discourse
against recompensing Evil for Evil; and to extirpate
that devilish temper of Revenge, would have us deny
our selves to a very high degree, rather than think of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warding
Evil with Evil; and to this purpose, instances
in another Man's going to Law with us out of Spleen
and Malice, in which he would not have his Disciples
follow or imitate such Men, but rather than return the
like injury, suffer and bear with their unjust Acts, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Vengeance to him, who hath said, <hi>I will repay;</hi> so
that Christ doth not absolutely condemn going to Law,
but only in these two eases. 1. If the Concern be small,
and of no great moment, or consequence: And, 2. If
we cannot go to Law, without Animosities, Grudges,
and revengeful Thoughts and Desires against our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Hammond.</hi>
               </note>
And hence it was, as a Learned Man
of our Church observes, upon <hi>James 2. 2.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="290" facs="tcp:103387:152"/>
That the Christians, even under the Heathen Emperors,
very early erected Courts of Judicature among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
in which Causes were decided, and Differences
about <hi>Meum</hi> and <hi>Tuum</hi> determined: And though the
Assemblies spoken of in St. <hi>James,</hi> are usually interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of Religious Assemblies, yet he very judiciously
shews, that it is more probable that they were Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies
upon the Account of hearing and deciding Causes
betwixt Man and Man, because Judges are expresly
mention'd, <hi>Vers. 4.</hi> And these Judges had Seats or Bench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
elevated, and higher than the Pavement, on which
they sat; and had their Foot-stools also, under which
the Poor were ordered to sit, <hi>Vers. 3.</hi> From whence
we may guess, what kind of Partiality they used; the
<hi>Poor</hi> Plaintiffs or Defendants were order'd to sit in the
lowest Seats; the <hi>Richer</hi> were permitted to sit with the
Judges, or the more honourable Men; which argued
too great a Respect of Persons, and was contrary to the
<hi>Jewish</hi> Rule, and, indeed, against the Law of Nations,
which condemned all Partiality in Judgment, and gave
the Poor as free Admittance to the Bar as the Rich, and
required equal Consideration of both States and Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
All which not being easily applicable to Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies
where the Word was preached, and the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
administred, 'tis in a manner necessary that we
apply it to Courts of Justice, where Civil Affairs and
Matters were debated: And if so, going to Law could
not be absolutely unlawful; and consequently, the Rules
and Conditions above-mention'd being observed, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to this Table during the Contest, and while the
Law-Suit is depending, cannot make a Man an unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Receiver.</p>
            <p>9. <hi>Knowing that other Men are not in Charity with him,
doth not make a Person an unworthy Receiver.</hi> This I have
known to be the fear of otherwise well-minded Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians;
while their Relations, Friends and Acquaintance
have been angry with them, and averse from being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:103387:152"/>
to them, they have forborn to receive, for fear
they should eat and drink unworthily. But,</p>
            <p>1. If it be, indeed, through our own fault, that others
will not be friends with us; if we have given the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
and will not humble our selves to the offended
Party, nor acknowledge our Faults, nor make them Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution,
or Satisfaction, or Reparation for the Injury;
and if thereupon, he that is offended will entertain no
charitable Thoughts of us; there the Case is plain, that
if we come to eat and drink at this holy Table, we
come with unrepented Sins upon our Backs, because we
receive, living in the Omission of a known Duty. He
that might quench a dangerous Fire, and will not, is
guilty of all the Mischief that ensues upon it: And he
that can shut the Sluce, thereby to prevent the Inunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his Neighbour's Garden, and wilfully forbears to
do it, hath an Hand in all the Hurt and Damage that
his Neighbour's Ground receives. As in the Law, <hi>Exod.
21. 29.</hi> if the Owner of the Beast knew <hi>that his Ox did
use to push with his Horns, and did not keep him in,</hi> he was
charged with the Man's Death that followed upon it;
so he that hath given just Occasion to others to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased
with him, and will apply no Remedy to heal
the Breach, doth not only sin, but makes himself acces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to the Uncharitableness of his Neighbour, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
Partner with him in his Sin: And such a Person
is a very unfit Guest at his Master's Table. But,</p>
            <p>2. If other Men hate us without a just Cause, and we
have given them no Occasion of Ill-Will or Displeasure
against us; or, having offended them by Words or A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
if we have tried all rational and prudential Means
to re-gain their Friendship, and to recover their Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and after all this, they will not be reconciled, there
their Sin and Obstinacy must not, cannot hinder us from
our Duty. Indeed, if they that are so stiff, and will
hearken to no Terms of Peace, come to this Table, they
sin with a witness; but their causless Hatred cannot have
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:103387:153"/>
the same Effect in us, it being not with their Sins, as it
is with a sort of fore Eyes, whose poysonous Steams will
infect those that look upon them; but the Arrows they
shoot, light upon their own Heads. If it were not so,
all the Apostles must have been unworthy Receivers, for
all the World clamour'd against them; they were hated
by <hi>Heathens,</hi> hated by the <hi>Jews,</hi> reviled by Strangers, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached
by their Country-men; and there was greater
hopes to reconcile Fire and Water, Light and Darkness,
than of reconciling some People in the World to them:
Yet did not this Hatred and Surliness of others make
them unworthy Communicants. If my Neighbour will
throw himself down from a Precipice, why should that
hinder me from walking in a plain Path? And if others
will be wicked, why should that be an Impediment of
my being good? 'Tis true, <hi>Christ, Matth. 5. 23, 24.</hi>
tells us, <hi>If thou bring thy Gift to the Altar, and there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
that thy Brother hath ought against thee, leave there
thy Gift before the Altar, and go thy way, first be reconciled
to thy Brother, and then come and offer thy Gift:</hi> Which
Words seem to import, that if another Man be not in
Charity with us, our Devotion cannot be accepted, till
he be reconciled to us. But these Words of <hi>Christ</hi> must
be explained by <hi>Vers. 22.</hi> which brings in the Discourse,
<hi>Vers. 23.</hi> for there our Saviour tells us, <hi>I say unto you, that
whosoever is angry with his Brother without a Cause, shall be
in danger of the Judgment; i. e.</hi> He that conceives Anger
against his Neighbour, and hopes to escape the Guilt of
Sin, must have a very just Cause for it, <hi>viz.</hi> There must
be a just Cause given him by his Neighbour; and then
it follows, <hi>If thy Brother have ought against thee, i. e.</hi> have
ought against thee justly, which thou hast given just Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
for, <hi>first be reconciled to thy Brother, and then offer
thy Gift.</hi> So that it is not another Man's bare having
ought against us, that makes us unworthy Receivers;
but if he have ought against us that we have been the
just Cause of, if we have kindled his Anger by something
that we have injuriously said or done against him, there
till we seek to be reconciled unto him, our Gifts, and
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:103387:153"/>
what we offer to God, must needs be odious to him,
because they are offer'd with an Heart that is not right
with him: But where we have either done nothing that
he can take just Exception against, or have done our
Duty, and what became our Place and Station, without
any Intent of doing him harm; or if, in case of an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
given, we have, by proper Means and Addresses,
sought to be at Peace with him, and notwithstanding all
this, he will still have ought against us; there his Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred,
and the whole Guilt of it will fall upon his own
Pate; nor can his Insolence or Ill-Nature darken the
Light of God's Love and Favour to us, who sees we
have done what became Christians, and honest Men;
and though it will not satisfie the angry Man, yet his
Choler cannot deprive us of the kind Looks of our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
which sees in secret, nor make us unworthy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers.</p>
            <p>10. A Man's having, as he supposes, received no Benefit
by this holy Sacrament, and coming to it again, doth not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
make him an unworthy Receiver: <hi>For,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. A Man may really be the better for having been
at this Sacrament, and yet, for the present, may not be
sensible of it, because he may measure his not being bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
by the want of some particular Qualifications he is
desirous of, and over-look those Advantages he hath in
good truth received by the holy Communion. Many
a pious Christian is the better for this Sacrament, though
he is loth to believe it; for his coming to this Table ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
strengthens him in his Hatred of Sin, and in his
Love to Religion; or advances him in Humility, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
Readiness to forgive Injuries, and in Charity;
and yet because he feels not just after it, those lively De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires,
those earnest Breathings after God, that Fervour
of Spirit, that Ardency in Prayer he expected, he may
think he receives no Benefit, because he doth not get
what at present he most desires, and feels not those Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies
and Accomplishments which are most upon
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:103387:154"/>
his Mind; yet all this while there may be an actual
Growth of Goodness in him, his other Graces may be
established, his Cautiousness of offending a merciful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer
increased, his Obedience and Self-denial advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
his Faith of another Life augmented, his Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to shun the very Appearances of Evil fortified; all
which, upon a strict Search, and View of his Inward
Man, he may find: And therefore I may justly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that if he receives the Benefit God thinks sit for
him, though he receives not the Benefit he desires, that
that Supposition of his, of receiving none at all, cannot
make him an unworthy Receiver.</p>
            <p>2. 'Tis possible we may receive no Benefit at all by
frequenting this Ordinance; and we may know we do
not, if we are the same in our Lives we were before.
If the Cross of Christ doth not draw us after him; if it
leaves us without Desires to be like him, or doth not
check the Sins we have been fond of; if it does not make
us stand in awe of God any more than we did before;
if it work no Love to God, no Charity to other Men's
Souls and Bodies in our Hearts; if after it, we rush into
Sin as easily as before; if it prove no Bridle to our sinful
Appetite, no Curb to our covetous Desires; if it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strains
us not in our Affections to the World; if it gives
us no Courage to resist, no Boldness to withstand those
Lusts which were dear to us; (but still this is clearly
our own Fault<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and for want of considering the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and Motives the Cross of Christ affords us to die
to Sin, for want of thinking on the Design of Christ's
Death, and for want of taking pains with our selves, for
want of reflecting on the Force of Divine Love, and for
want of earnest Prayers and Addresses for the powerful
Assistance of God's Spirit:) If it be thus with us, we
have reason to be afraid God will not rejoyce over us
when he comes to view our Souls in this Ordinance.
However, All this need not be an Obstacle to our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation:
If we have done ill, 'tis our Interest to awake
out of Sleep, and to redeem the Time: If we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:103387:154"/>
no Benefit before, upon our Amendment we
may: If we have done the Work of the Lord negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently,
upon our Reformation, God may may turn our
Captivity, <hi>as the Streams in the South.</hi> It is with this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
as it is with a rich Mine, which yields no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
to the Owner, till he works it. The Benefit Men
receive here, is the Effect of Labour: They must be
disposed and qualified for this Gift; and that which
qualifies them, is, to quit that Slothfulnes they were
guilty of.</p>
            <p>11. Communicating with Persons that receive unworthily,
doth not necessarily make a Person an unworthy Receiver.
<hi>For,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Every Man shall bear his own Burthen,</hi> Gal. 6. 5. If
another be wicked, how can his Wickedness unsettle
my Faith, or disorder my Devotion, except I consent
to his Impiety, or suffer my self to be enticed by it? E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Man's Sin is a personal thing, (except in case of
Scandal) and the Offender only shall feel the Smart of
it: He that is free from the other's Offence, shall be
freed also from the Penalty due to the Offence; and
then what hurt do I receive by an ill Man's communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating
in my Company? I may eat with a Leprous,
with a diseased, with a Gouty Man, at a common Table,
and yet not participate of his Distemper: And why
should I share in his Guilt at the Lord's Table, when I
both abhor it, and keep my self from the Infection?
<hi>The Soul that sins shall die,</hi> is God's standing Rule, <hi>Ezek.
18. 20. The Son shall not bear the Iniquity of the Father, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
shall the Father bear the Iniquity of the Son; the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
of the Righteous shall be upon him, and the Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Wicked shall be upon him.</hi> If therefore I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
with a practical Faith, and another with Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
or, which is all one, with a Faith without Works,
<hi>shall his Unbelief make the Faith of God of no effect?</hi> Rom.
3. 3.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="296" facs="tcp:103387:155"/>
2. What Hurt did the Guests receive at the Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding-Feast,
<hi>Matth. 22. 11, 12.</hi> by eating with the Man
who had no Wedding-Garment? Were they rejected
by the Master of the Feast, because they feasted in his
Company? No; All that came adorn'd with a suitable
Temper, and in whose Spirit there was no Guile, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the Caresses of the King; and none but the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane
Wretch felt the Thunder of the Prince's Anger;
of him alone 'tis said, <hi>Bind him Hand and Foot, and take
him away, and cast him into Outer Darkness, there shall be
Weeping and Gnashing of Teeth:</hi> As he was singular in his
Sin, so he was singular in his Punishment: His coming
unprepared did not divest others of their Garments, nor
did his Misery reach those that sate down with him:
Their own Faith saved them, while the other's Infideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
condemned him: The Master doth not so much as
frown upon the rest, doth not so much as give them
an angry Word; nor doth he expostulate with them,
why they would bear him Company: They charitably
believed he was a good Man, because he was invited
with them; and their Charity made their own Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
acceptable, while the other's was Abomination to
the Lord.</p>
            <p>3. If I see another Man, whom I know to be, or to
have been a notorious Sinner, kneel down by me at this
holy Table, he must not therefore be an Object of my
Scorn, but of my Pity and Compassion. I can make
an excellent Use of seeing him in my Company, for I
can pray for him, and beg of God that he would over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awe
his Spirit with a Sense of the Death of <hi>Christ,</hi> and
strike him into Repentance and Humiliation. I can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
my Heavenly Father to give him a Sight of the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
of his Ways, and Resolutions never to profane
that Cross again, on which the great Redeemer of the
World suffered. I can pray that his Sight of the Bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Jesus</hi> may work upon his Soul, and fill his Heart
with holy Compunctions, and his Eyes with Tears.
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:103387:155"/>
I can pray that, after this Communion, he may take
heed, and sin no more; that the Solemnity may leav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
such a Fear upon his Spirit, that he may dread to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
God, more than putting his Hand in the Fire.
And where I do so, I do at once exercise my Pity, and
raise mine own Devotion; I imitate Christ on the Cross,
praying for his Murtherers, and, with him, become a
Sollicitor for those that have derided and spit upon
him. And this, sure, cannot make me an unworthy
Receiver.</p>
            <p>4. Who hath given me a Key to other Men's Hearts,
whereby I can judge, at the Receiving of the <hi>Eucharist,</hi>
that my Neighbour receives unworthily? How do I
know, but that he who was vicious a Week ago, may
become a Penitent that Day? Or, Who assures me,
that he who did cast God's Laws behind him Yesterday,
may not this Day cry out, <hi>O wretched Man that I am?</hi>
Who bids me trouble my Head about another's Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
when I have enough to do with mine own Heart?
And while I give my self liberty to judge another, is it
not a very great Sign that I am not very sensible of
mine own Vileness? If I am truly concern'd about mine
own spiritual Welfare, I shall not be at leisure to dive
into other Men's Lives and Consciences. My own
Sins will be Burthen enough to me, that I shall not
need to concern my self about another's Business. If I
give my self to Censoriousness at such times, I lose my
Charity and Humility: And if the Rule be, <hi>to esteem
others better than our selves,</hi> I do not very heartily obey
that Precept while I suffer my Mind to dwell upon
other Men's Faults and Errours. Christianity bids me
to have humble Thoughts of my self; and if I think
that all that receive with me, may be, for ought I know,
better than my self, I assuredly prepare for God's Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
who ever gives Grace to the Humble.</p>
            <p>5. If <hi>Judas</hi> the Traytor was present at this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as well as the other <hi>Apostles;</hi> and his being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:103387:156"/>
did not make the rest unworthy Receivers; why
should I think that a wicked Man's coming with me to
this Table should make me one? That <hi>Judas</hi> was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
at this Sacrament, we have the concurrent Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of three <hi>Evangelists;</hi> for they all confess that <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi>
sate down with the Twelve, to the Eating of the
Passover; and while they were eating, <hi>Jesus</hi> admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred
the holy Sacrament to them: So St. <hi>Matth. 26. 26.
As they were eating, Jesus took Bread, and blessed it, and
brake it, and gave it to the Disciples, and said, Take, eat,
this is my Body.</hi> So St. <hi>Mark, 14. 22. And as they did
eat, Jesus took Bread, and blessed, and brake it, and gave
to them, and said, Take, eat, this is my Body.</hi> Nay,
St. <hi>Luke</hi> is more express, 22. 19, 20, 21. <hi>And he took
Bread, and gave Thanks, and brake it, and gave unto them,
saying, This is my Body,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But, behold! the Hand of him
which betrays me, is with me on the Table,</hi> &amp;c. St. <hi>John,</hi>
indeed, tells us, that <hi>Judas</hi> having <hi>received the Sop,</hi> in
the Passover, <hi>he went immediately out,</hi> Joh. 13. 30. But
since the Evangelist mentions nothing of the Sacrament,
his Silence about <hi>Judas</hi>'s being present at the Sacrament,
can be no Argument; and his Words may justly be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strued
thus, <hi>Having received the Sop in the Passover, and
stay'd till the Sacrament was administred to him and the rest
of the Disciples, he immediately went out.</hi> For the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
being administred by Christ, while they were eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Passover, by the <hi>Sop,</hi> St. <hi>John</hi> must needs be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to understand both the Passover, and that which
was, without Delay, subjoyned to it; <hi>i. e.</hi> the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
And whereas it is objected, that the Sacrament
could not have been conveniently administred if the
Traytor had been present, that is a Supposition which
contradicts the Matter of Fact recorded by the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists:
And who can judge so well of the Convenience
and Inconvenience of Things, as Christ himself? If
Christ thought it convenient to give it him, who shall
say, it was not so? Nor could the Disciples be much
surprized at it, when they had so often heard their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
say, that <hi>the T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s and Wheat must grow together until
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:103387:156"/>
the Harvest;</hi> and that the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> or the
Church-Militant, <hi>was like a Net, containing good Fish and
bad.</hi> And though the Words Christ used in this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<hi>This is my Body, which is given for you;</hi> and <hi>This
is the New Testament in my Blood, which is shed for you,
for the Remission of Sins,</hi> cannot be directly applied to
<hi>Judas;</hi> yet since these Blessings are promised conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
in other places of Scripture, they might belong to
<hi>Judas</hi> conditionally, in case he repented, or brought
forth Fruits meet for Repentance; as they belong'd to
the other Disciples absolutely, because their Hearts were
sincere, and without Hypocrisie. Nor is it strange,
that <hi>Christ</hi> should say in the presence of <hi>Judas, I will not
drink henceforth of the Fruit of the Vine, until the Day when
I drink it new with you in my Father's Kingdom:</hi> For there
is nothing more common in the Writings of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
when they address themselves to a whole Church,
than to apply to them in general the Promises of the
Gospel, though true Believers only have a Right in them.
<hi>We remember, without ceasing, your Work of Faith, and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
of Love, and Patience of Hope in our Lord Jesus Christ,
in the Sight of God, and our Father: Knowing, Brethren,
Beloved, your Election of God; and ye became Followers of
us, and of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. saith St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the whole
Church of the <hi>Thessalonians, 1 Thes. 1. 3, 4, 6.</hi> in which
we may suppose there were divers Hypocrites, to whom
these Elogies could not properly belong: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
when Christ spake these Words to the Disciples,
<hi>Judas</hi> being present, it was enough that they belonged
to the major part of them; and those that were quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
for that Mercy, might appropriate it to themselves.
It is confessed that Christ, <hi>Matth. 7. 6.</hi> saith, <hi>Give not
that which is holy unto Dogs:</hi> But it is evident from the
Connexion of the Words, that <hi>that Saying</hi> is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
of Reproof, or Fraternal Correction; which
is to be superseded where Men are incorrigible, and
Mockers of Religion, and, after several Admonitions,
instead of being better, become worse, and scorn the
Truth of the Gospel; a Precept of the same Import with
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:103387:157"/>
that of <hi>Solomon, Prov. 9. 8. Reprove not a Scorner, lest he
hate thee.</hi> If it were to be understood of publick Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances,
it might be applied to the Preaching of the
Word, as well as to the Sacrament; and it would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
that wicked Men were to be banished from the
one, as well as the other; which is absurd, and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to the practice of the holy Apostles. And what if
<hi>Christ</hi> calls <hi>Judas</hi> a <hi>Devil? Joh. 6. 70. Devils,</hi> 'tis true,
are incapable of Receiving this Sacrament; yet we must
not think that he calls him so upon any other Account,
but his Hellish Qualities: For which Reason he says of
all other wicked Men, that they <hi>are of their Father the
Devil,</hi> Joh. 8. 44. Nay, in his Reproof to <hi>Peter,</hi> who
was against his Suffering, he calls him <hi>Satan,</hi> or <hi>Devil;</hi>
because to be against his Suffering, was to joyn with the
Devil, who, of all things, dreaded that Death, as the
Ruine of his Empire. So that <hi>Judas</hi> was still a Man,
though a wicked Man; yet not so wicked, but that he
was still capable of Repentance; and in giving him this
Sacrament, he declared him so: And though he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
nothing but the external Elements, yet in being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to the external Symbols, he had an <hi>Item</hi> given
him, that if he had come with unfeigned Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
he should have received the Promise too.
And that Christ offered him these Symbols, was to tell
his Followers how it would be with their Congregations
in time to come; and how Wolves, as well as Sheep,
would present themselves at this Table. But it is usually
pleaded, that if it be granted that <hi>Judas</hi> was present at
this Sacrament, yet still he had a good Out-side, he was
far from being a scandalous Sinner; so that the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
could not be offended. But this Argument is of
no weight at all; for, whether he were a scandalous Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
or no, as long as Christ had declared him a Devil,
and a Traytor, it was as much as if he had been a scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous
Sinner; and the Disciples might be as confident
of it, as if they had seen him run into Excess of Riot.
So that <hi>Judas</hi> being present at the Sacrament, and his
Presence not interfering with the worthy Receiving of
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:103387:157"/>
the other Disciples, it follows, that another Man recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
unworthily, cannot make us, that come with sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Vertues, unworthy Receivers. And yet, after all
this, I would not be understood, as if scandalous Sinners
were not to be separated from this holy Table, by those
whose Office it is to forbid and hinder them: For tho'
<hi>Christ</hi> suffered <hi>Judas</hi> to be present, thereby prophetical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to fore-tell, how in future Ages, notwithstanding all
the Care that should be taken, Hypocrites and Sinners
would mingle with the Good and Sincere in this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
yet this contradicts not the Commission he gave
to the Apostles, to <hi>do all things decently, and in order;</hi> of
which orderly part, this is one great Rule, <hi>1 Cor. 5. 11.
If any Man that is called a Brother, be a Fornicator, or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous,
or an Idolater, or a Railer, or a Drunkard, or an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortioner,
with such an one, no not to eat.</hi> 'Tis confessed,
that this is to be understood of common Meals: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
the Consequence is very easie; if we are not to eat
with such at common Tables, we are to forbear eating
with them at the Lord's Table: But then 'tis fit withal,
that the Church should excommunicate such Persons first,
that there may be a Mark set upon them, whereby we
may know them to be so, and avoid their Company.
If the Church, either by reason of the Multitude of such
Sinners, or for want of sufficient Information, cannot, or,
through Neglect, doth not; a private Christian is not
therefore to be scandalized at such Persons when they
come to the Sacrament, nor think himself therefore an
unworthy Communicant because such are present, there
being no publick Mark set upon them, whereby he is au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized
not to eat with them. The Church, indeed,
doth as good as formally excommunicate all such, when,
in her Admonition or Exhortation before the Sacrament,
She declares, <hi>Therefore if any of you be a Blasphemer of God,
an Hinderer or Slanderer of his Word, an Adulterer, or be in
Malice or Envy, or any other grievous Crime, repent you of
your Sins, or else come not to this holy Table, lest, after the
Taking of this holy Sacrament, the Devil enter into you, as he
enter'd into</hi> Judas, <hi>and fill you full of all Iniquities, and bring
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:103387:158"/>
you to destruction both of Body and Soul:</hi> But though
this be a kind of general Excommunication, yet except
the particular Persons be taken notice of, and branded
by the Church, a private Chrstian must judge charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
of those that come; and if he do so, their Impiety
cannot hinder him from being a worthy Partaker of the
Sacrament. I have been the longer upon this Point,
because I have known it to be a great Scruple, that
hath hinder'd many from coming to the Lord's Table,
being possessed with Fear, that if they should meet with
such Persons there, they should eat and drink unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily</p>
            <p>12. <hi>Eating and Drinking at this Table, with some scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
upon the Mind, doth not necessarily make a Man an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
Receiver.</hi> By a <hi>scrupulous</hi> Conscience, I do not
mean an <hi>erroneous,</hi> nor a <hi>doubtful</hi> Conscience, the <hi>former</hi>
being, when a Person thinks <hi>that</hi> his Duty, which is
directly against the Word and Will of God, as it was
with the Jews, <hi>Joh. 16. 2.</hi> The <hi>other,</hi> when a Person
doubts, whether such and such Actions be lawful or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful,
as it was with those Christians, <hi>Rom. 14. 23.</hi> But
a <hi>scrupulous</hi> Conscience proceeds from fear, and fear
caus'd by slight and weak Arguments, whereby a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is satisfied, that such a Thing or Action is his Duty
but Melancholy, or the Devil, or Converse with scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous
Persons, inject some Thoughts, which makes a
Person fluctuate or waver in his performance: For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
a Man, conscious of his own wants, knows, that
coming to the Lord's Table is his Duty, and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he comes, yet comes with fears in his Mind; fears
caus'd either by what he hath read, or by what he
hath heard, or by what he hath seen in others; fears
that suggest to him, that he should not have come, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he hath not every thing that he observes in other
good Christians. Now, I say, that eating and drinking
with such scruples upon his Mind, doth not make him
an unworthy Receiver.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="303" facs="tcp:103387:158"/>
1. Because, notwithstanding these scruples, he may
be sincere in his Faith and Love, he may sincerely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire,
and be sincerely willing to keep himself unspotted
from the World, and to embrace the <hi>Wisdom, which is
from above, first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easie to be
entreated.</hi> He may, for all this, deliberately chuse Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness,
as the better part, and his Faith may be carried
out to embrace Christ, as his Mediator and Governor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and he may actuate his Love so, that he shall be afraid
of the appearances of Evil; and if it be thus with him,
notwithstanding his little scruple, he may be, and will
certainly be, a welcome Guest at this Holy Table; for
God judges of us by the sincerity of our Hearts, not
by every little accidental fear that may surprize us, and
to discompose a timorous Mind. And therefore,</p>
            <p>2. Such scruples may lawfully be rejected, opposed,
and banish'd out of our Minds, without danger: Nay,
they ought to be resisted, and a Christian in this case is
obliged not to harbour them, and to be resolute in stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
his Ears against them, especially where he finds so
good a foundation in himself, as I mentioned in the
foregoing Paragraph. To give regard to them, is the
way to multiply them; and to ruminate upon them,
is to let in, or to open the Door to greater per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities.
Nor is this to act against Conscience, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the true Rules of Conscience, for a Scruple is
a needless Fear, and without just ground, which Fear can
bring no obligation upon the Party thus assaulted:
And it is observed by experience, where Persons use
a kind of Violence to expel such Scruples, they strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
their Faith and their Conscience, fit themselves for
greater Duties, and become more expedient in their Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
to the City of the living God.</p>
            <p>13. <hi>Want of great Knowledge doth not make a Man an
unworthy Receiver.</hi> It's confessed, that some knowledge
is necessary in order to a worthy Receiving, for <hi>this is
Eternal Life, that they know thee the only true God, and him,
whom thou hast sent, Jesus Christ,</hi> Joh. 17. 3. But the
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:103387:159"/>
knowledge requisite lies within a small compass, and he
that knows no more than the <hi>six Fundamental Principles</hi>
laid down by <hi>St. Paul, Heb. 6. 1, 2.</hi> knows enough, in
order to a comfortable Communion. Those Principles
are, 1. <hi>Repentance from dead Works,</hi> That Repentance
from our known Sins is absolutely necessary. 2. <hi>Faith
towards God,</hi> That God must be believ'd, according to
the Revelations he hath vouchsafed to Mankind, in his
Word, and that the things contain'd in that Book are
infallibly true. 3. <hi>The Doctrine of Baptism,</hi> That we
are Baptiz'd in the Name of <hi>God</hi> the <hi>Father, Son</hi> and
<hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> and thereby have given our selves up to his
Service. 4. <hi>Laying on of hands,</hi> That the Holy Ghost,
whereof that laying on of hands in Confirmation <hi>is an
external Sign,</hi> is certainly dispensed and bestowed in
some measure on all those that are Baptiz'd, whereby
they are enabled to fight against Sin, the World, the
Flesh and the Devil. 5. <hi>Resurrection of the Dead,</hi> That
there shall be a Resurrection of Men's Bodies, wherein
they shall be reunited to their Souls, and appear before
God's dreadful Tribunal, to give an account of their
Lives and Actions. 6. <hi>Eternal Judgment,</hi> That in the
last Day, the controversie of Men's Happiness, or Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happiness,
shall be decided, and Men shall be either
sent into Eternal Life, or into Eternal Fire. He that
knows there <hi>Six Principles,</hi> and believes them, and is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd
to act accordingly, hath knowledge enough to
fit him for a worthy participation of this Ordinance;
for these are sufficient Motives to remember the Death
of the Son of God, with holy Resolutions to follow
him, that we may be partakers of his everlasting Bliss.
But that a Man must needs be a competent Scholar,
and understand the whole Mystery of Godliness, and be
able to give an account of the nicer Points of Divinity,
and to answer the harder Questions about the manner
and nature of those Things, which God hath revealed;
This is not necessary: Ignorance of the abstruser Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blems
of Theology, doth not make a Man an unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Receiver. For,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="305" facs="tcp:103387:159"/>
1. So much Knowledge is only necessary, as serves
to make us Practical Christians, and a small stock of
Knowledge will do that; and he that knows, that Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
was lost by <hi>Adam</hi>'s <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>all, and stands in need of a
Saviour, to reconcile them to God; and that <hi>Christ Jesus</hi>
the Son of God, who being in the Form of God, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed
our Nature, and died for us, is that Saviour, who
is both able and willing to reconcile us to an offended
God, upon the reasonable terms of turning from a sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual
and sinful Life, and making his Life and Precepts
the Rule of our Conversation, whereupon we shall be
pardoned, and obtain Eternal Life. He that knows
these few particulars, (and how easily are they learned
and imbibed!) knows enough to make him a Practical
Christian, if he will but act according to these Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
and this unfeigned willingness makes him a worthy
Receiver; for this Sacrament, as hath been often hinted
in the Premises, is to increase our Practice, to augment
our Love to Holiness, to strengthen our Resolutions to
follow Christ, to cleanse us from that filthines which
naturally besets us, and to enlarge our Graces; and
since that Knowledge, I have mentioned, is a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Preparative for all this, it must be a sufficient Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative
for the Holy Sacrament.</p>
            <p>2. Much Knowledge very often hinders Men from
the Practical part of Religion. It need not do it, and
it ought not to do it, but we see it frequently doth:
for Men are apt to be taken with fine Notions; and
while their Delight runs all that way, they forget too
often to delight greatly in God's Commandments. This
is too evident in many Men, who are great Scholars,
who satisfie themselves with this, that they know more
than the Vulgar, and neglect those severer Parts of Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical
Religion, which many of the Vulgar do conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiously
observe; and many an ordinay Man, that knows
little more than his Creed, but makes that Creed an
<hi>inforcive</hi> to Obedience, is in a happier condition, than
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:103387:160"/>
the greater <hi>Literati,</hi> who trouble their Heads so much
about Controversies and Criticisms, that they bestow
little time upon Mortification. In the Primitive Ages,
when Men knew not much, they practis'd more; as,
since Knowledge hath increas'd, Men's practices have
much degenerated from the simplicity of the Gospel:
Not that I commend Ignorance in the Laity, as they
do in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> but, I think, a little know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
improv'd into great severity of Life, is safer, and
more beneficial, than great skill in Divinity, without
suitable Fruits of Righteousness. So that upon a review
of the whole, I may safely conclude, that want of great
Knowledge doth not make a Man an unworthy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver.</p>
            <p>III. From what we have said, it will be easie to guess
in the next place, <hi>what it is to Eat and Drink unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily:</hi>
For from Negatives, Affirmatives may be inferred
without any great difficulty; and tho', after this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
I might spare my pains in setting down the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,
yet to assist the Weak, and to conform my self
to the meanest capacity; I shall explain the Nature of
this unworthy Eating and Drinking, in the following
Observations.</p>
            <p>1. To Eat and Drink unworthily, is <hi>to Eat and Drink
by force.</hi> By Eating and Drinking by <hi>force,</hi> I mean,
coming to this Sacrament, either because the Law of the
Land Commands it, or because our Superiors, under
whose Command we are, or from whom we expect
some Gain and Benefit, or, in case of neglect of their
Orders, apprehend some danger or injury to our Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
Concerns, will not be satisfied without it: Not,
but that a Servant, or whoever is under a Command
of others, ought to give heed to the Pious Counsel and
Advice of those that are above him, take it into consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
and make advantage of that opportunity, to
apply himself to the serious practice of it, and thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
consu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t with Divines, and with his own Conscience,
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:103387:160"/>
how to make his Calling and Election sure; but where
a Person is altogether passive in the thing, regards more
what his Superiors say, than what his Conscience feels,
and comes more to please those which are above him,
than to discharge his Duty; where his chief motive is to
give content to those, whose Favour he is loth to lose,
where he would certainly neglect coming, were it not
for the danger of prejudicing, what is very dear to him
in the World; there, I say, he <hi>Eats and Drinks unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily:</hi>
For,</p>
            <p>1. Such a Person stands more in awe of Man, than of
God. God's Command cannot make him do that,
which Human Injunctions can. Dust and Ashes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
more with him, than the Holy One of <hi>Israel.</hi> Man's
Anger and Displeasure moves and affects him more, than
the Indignation of a jealous God; and with what Eyes
can the Almighty look upon that Wretch, whom he
sees more concern'd to please a <hi>poor Grashopper,</hi> (so Man
is call'd, <hi>Es. 4. 22.)</hi> than him <hi>that sits upon the Circles of
the Earth?</hi> How can he but set his Face against that
Communicant, whose slavish temper he spies at his Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
whose Heart sticks close to the Earth, and makes
no great account of him, who daily courts him by his
Favours? How can he but frown upon that Creature,
whom no Charms of an Almighty Love can melt, and
the threatning of Man can affright into any thing? <hi>Who
art thou that thou shouldest be afraid of a Man that shall dye,
and of the Son of Man, that shall be made as Grass? And
forgettest the Lord thy Maker, that hath stretched forth
the Heavens, and laid the foundations of the Earth?</hi> saith
God. <hi>Isa. 51. 12, 13.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Such a Person, his outward Man only receives
the Holy Sacrament. <hi>His Soul,</hi> for which this Feast is
chiefly prepared, receives nothing. The Brute only
appears at the Table, the Angel stays away<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects
the Master at this Banquet, not the Slave. The
Body is not capable of this Sacred Food, the Soul is
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:103387:161"/>
the proper Guest: This is it, that can expect refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
at this Board; and he that comes to feed his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
only, knows not yet what this Ordinance was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
for; where a Man brings nothing but his Body
to this <hi>Love-Feast,</hi> leaving his Soul enslaved to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
of the World, or to the Will of Mortal Men, he
must needs receive unworthily; for God's enemy, which
is the World, engrosses that part, which should appear
before God, and behold, and be ravish'd with his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Greatness and Goodness, and with the admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
designs in spreading the Royal Table for him. To
what purpose is the Carkase, while that, which should
animate it, is engaged another way? Can the <hi>Shell</hi>
please God, who hath so often declared, that he will
be satisfied with nothing but the <hi>Kernel?</hi> And in vain
doth he require the <hi>Heart,</hi> if the outward frame were
Sacrifice sufficient. So that what <hi>Christ</hi> saith, <hi>Joh. 6. 63.</hi>
may justly be applied here, tho' with some variation
of the Sense, <hi>It's the Spirit that quickneth, the Flesh profits
nothing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. To Eat and Drink unworthily, <hi>is, to make this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
a matter of custom only:</hi> Where Men approach,
because it's fashionable, to observe the <hi>decorum</hi> of their
being Members of a Church more, than to grow in a
Spiritual Life, and know no other enforcive, or can
give no account of any other, but this, Because it is usual
for Men, who are Baptized, and profess themselves
Christians, and go to the Publick to do so; there they

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>undecently,</hi> or <hi>unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily:</hi>
And this is the case of many ignorant People,
both in City and Country, who come for company-sake;
and because their Neighbors use to do so, who
think it not a Province belonging to them to know, or
dive into the mysteries of Salvation, but trust to it, that
God is merciful, and will save them, though they know
not why, or how; whose Affections are bound up with
the Earth, and will be sensible of no higher Felicity,
than what a good Crop, and a full Purse, affords. Now,
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:103387:161"/>
that to receive with no higher Aims, or from no better
Principles, is, to receive unworthily, will appear from
hence:</p>
            <p>1. Because such Persons receive, without being affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and touched with the Riches and Treasures opened,
revealed, discovered and offered in this Sacrament;
Treasures greater than those the Wise Men laid down
at the Feet of the <hi>Infant Saviour;</hi> Treasures beyond all
Gold, and Myrrh, and Frankincense, and all the Gums
the <hi>Happy Arabia</hi> yields; Treasures of higher value than
those the Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> brought to <hi>Solomon the Great;</hi>
Treasures richer than those the King of <hi>Judah</hi> shewed
to the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Ambassadors. To shew their Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
above all Earthly Treasures, were to prove that
Light is better than Darkness, and a Ball of Diamond
than a piece of Turf, or that the Wisdom of a Minister
of State exceeds that of a Sucking Babe: For, if it be
true, as without doubt it is, that God was crucified, or
that he who was God humbled himself to an ignomini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Death for our sakes, and that this Love, with all its
Benefits, is proclaimed in our Ears, and tender'd to our
Souls in this Sacrament; there is not a Child, but must
grant, that all that this World affords must be mere Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
to it. And as this Treasure of the World's Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
is the rich Mine discovered in this Sacrament, so
he whom Custom and Company only brings to it must
needs receive unworthily, because he sees not, he feels
not, he is sensible of no such Treasure; which, if he
were, he would go to it as a poor Beggar, almost star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
goes to a rich Man's House, there to receive a vast
Sum of Money, beyond his Expectation; and come
wondering at the Honour that God intends him, won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
at the Favour God designs him, wondering at
the Riches he shall be presented with, wondering at
himself what God should see in him, to be thus liberal
and bountiful to him; wondering to see what God hath
provided for him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="310" facs="tcp:103387:162"/>
2. Such a Man eats and drinks in this Sacrament, as
if it were common Bread and Wine that is set before
him; he approaches, and makes no more of it, than if
it were a private or ordinary Table; he considers not
what this Bread and Wine represent, and, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle's
Phrase is, <hi>discerns not the Lord's Body;</hi> discerns not
that the Body of him who was the Creator of Heaven
and Earth, is pointed at in these Elements. 'Tis true,
materially considered, it is the same with the Bread and
Wine set upon our Tables at home; but the signification
of it makes it Celestial Food, separates it from common
Use, raises it above vulgar Diet; and the <hi>Stamp</hi> God
sets upon it, makes it truly the <hi>Bread of the Lord,</hi> and the
<hi>Cup of the Lord.</hi> He whom Custom only carries to the
House of God, distinguishes not the Mysteriousness and
Holiness of this Food; which, if he did, he would touch
it with the same Awe and Reverence that the <hi>Woman,</hi>
troubled with a <hi>Bloody Issue,</hi> touch'd the He<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of <hi>Christ</hi>'s
Garment, <hi>Quaking and Trembling,</hi> Mar. 5. 33.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>To eat and drink unworthily, is, to receive without true
Repentance.</hi> Where Men either do not think it requisite
to leave their Sins, or pretend that they do part with
them, when they do not; where they mistake the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Damp that is upon their Spirits, for a Change of
Life; or the melancholy and sullen Humour that hath
surprized them, for the new Nature Religion is to give
them; or forbear the external Acts of their Sins they
have formerly hugg'd, and run out into, but are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
to mortifie their secret Desires after him; where
they mistake their Act of Preparation, for the Act of
pulling down the Strong Holds of Iniquity, so that their
Lusts and Love to Sin remain; where they give the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
leave to retire a while, but are loth to take their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting
Farewel of him; and therefore, after the <hi>House
is swept and garnished,</hi> even after Receiving, open the
Door to him again: Where it is so, there Men eat and
drink unworthily. For,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="311" facs="tcp:103387:162"/>
1. Such Persons, instead of doing Honour to <hi>Christ,</hi>
affront him, are still in League with that which killed
him; pretend Sorrow for their Sins, yet secretly espouse
them; give out they have sent them a Bill of Divorce,
but still keep close Correspondence with them; would
make God and Men believe that they are Christ's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
when they are still his Enemies; would persuade
others that they have brought their Necks under his
Yoak, when the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or that which bears rule in
their Souls, is their Carnality and Sensuality. In this
Sacrament a most solemn Profession is made, and ought
to be made, of our Weariness of a sinful Life; which is
the reason why the Church, in her Publick Office, doth
particularly address her self to such Persons as find it;
and to such, that comfortable place of St. <hi>John</hi> is usually
applied, <hi>If any Man sin, we have an Advocate with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
Jesus Christ the Righteous,</hi> 1 Joh. 2. 1. that is, <hi>If any
Man sin, so as to be truly weary of it;</hi> or if he hath sinned,
and feels such a Remorse, that he detests himself for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
done so, and thereupon bids Defiance to the Works
of Darkness; <hi>We have an Advocate</hi> that will plead for us,
prevail with God not to cast us away because we have
forsaken him, and, by his Merits, make our Repentance
valuable, that it shall prove a Propitiation for our Sins.
But he that professes Weariness, yet is not tired with his
sinful Course, not only mocks God, but gives himself the
Lye; and seems to fancy, that he who dwelleth on high
sees not the secret Intrigues and Intentions of his Soul:
Which is Profanation of Religion.</p>
            <p>2. Such a Person destroys the End for which he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
to come to this holy Sacrament; for that End is,
Growth in Grace: And how shall he grow in Grace,
that is unresolved to part from those Sins which do so
easily beset him? These things are, and cannot but be,
Obstacles and Impediments to that Growth: And
Worms and Caterpillars are not more noxious to young
Trees, than these unrepented Sins are to this Growth;
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:103387:163"/>
and a Man may as well hope that an Elm in his Ground
will, within a few Years, be tall enough to over-shadow
his whole House, when there is nothing but Rock at the
bottom. Unrepented Sins make the Heart mere Stony
Ground: Goodness may peep forth, but, having no
Earth, it must necessarily wither, and come to nothing.
People may pull and hale a Ship with their Arms long
enough, before they can make it move, while the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chors
are not taken up<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Their unrepented Sins are the
Anchors that keep the Soul fixed to Earth and Hell;
and to think Grace will move or advance while that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor
holds it, is to imagine that an House will be built
without Materials; or a Field bring forth Corn, that
was never sown, or never felt the Labour and Industry
of the Husband-man. The End must ever be procured
by the Means; and they only betray their Folly and
Simplicity, that talk of <hi>adding to their Faith, Vertue; and
to Vertue, Knowledge; and to Knowledge, Temperance; and
to Temperance, Godliness; and to Godliness, Patience; that
have not escaped the Pollutions of the World, through Lust,</hi>
2 Pet. 1. 4, 5. This is to invert the Method of Grace;
and to expect that a Tree should begin to grow at the
Top before it hath a Root, or that Bread should be ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
before the Oven be heated. These Pollutions must
first be removed; and the Ground being cleared of the
Rubbish, you may go and superstruct the intended E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difice.</p>
            <p>4. To eat and drink unworthily, <hi>is, to eat and drink
without sincere Resolutions of Obedience.</hi> This is consequent
to the former Article, for Obedience is a necessary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitant
of Repentance; and when the Repentance
ends not in Obedience, the Repentance is a Cheat. A
Man may, by some Reasons and Arguments, be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd
with to part with Sins that are of the bigger sort,
when he thinks of coming to this Sacrament; but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
he, at the same time, seriously resolves to obey <hi>Christ</hi>
in every thing he commands him, and particularly, in
things which are levell'd against his Worldly Interest.
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:103387:163"/>
and is heartily willing to endeavour after those Vertues
which are the proper Characteristicks of his Disciples,
he certainly deceives his own Soul. To shake Hands
with scandalous Sins, and to think that now the Work
is done, without an holy Readiness to venture on those
Graces which render'd the Apostles and the Primitive
Believers what they were, <hi>i. e.</hi> amiable in the Sight of
God; such as Humility, Meekness, Overcoming the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
with Good, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In a Word, to lop the most luxuriant
Branches of the evil Tree, and not to take care that it
may bring forth good Fruit, is, to do the Work by
halves, and the Way to eat and drink unworthily.
For,</p>
            <p>1. Such Persons continue in Rebellion against God.
What is Rebellion, but not to obey when we know his
Will, and have all possible Opportunities to know it?
If God will have me do a thing, and I pass it by, as if
I heard him not; and when it is often inculcated and
pressed upon me in Sermons, and my Memory refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the Duty, and yet still I look upon it as need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
or a thing which doth not concern me; what is
this but Obstinacy? And I need not tell you, that <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
is as the Sin of Witchcraft,</hi> 1 Sam. 15. 22. Thus
<hi>Samuel</hi> tells <hi>Saul,</hi> upon his Disobedience to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of God, of extirpating the <hi>Amalekites.</hi> 'Tis pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,
<hi>Saul</hi> had his Excuses, and thought God might
not mean it in that rigid Sense that the Prophet's Words
imported; or, that if he executed part of the Order,
it would be sufficient: But these are not things that avail
much with God; notwithstanding all this, the Prophet
calls his Neglect, Rebellion. I know, and am sensible,
that a very worthy Communicant may sometimes igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly
neglect a Duty, and yet preserve an Interest in
God's Love; because, as soon as he comes to know his
Errour, he doth not encourage it in himself, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms
it. But this differs very much from Disobedience
to things peremptorily commanded, and which, every
Day that we hear or read the Word, are represented
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:103387:164"/>
to us, as necessary: Here, not to resolve to do those
things, is, opposing our Wills to God's Will; and though
we do not do it openly, yet, in effect, we do it; and
whereas God thinks such a Vertue necessary to Salvation,
we will not think it so; and, notwithstanding his assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
us, that without such Accomplishments, we cannot
inherit Eternal Life, we fancy we may: And what is
this, but crossing the Will of God? And how much
does this want of Rebellion, and thinking our selves wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser
than God? And surely, these are not very good
Qualities to dispose a Man to eat and drink worthily at
this holy Table.</p>
            <p>2. Such Persons discover their Desires to be <hi>their own</hi>
still, their own Masters, their own Governors, and at
their own dispose; contrary to the express Assertion of
the Holy Ghost, That they who pretend an Interest in
Christ's Blood, are <hi>their own no more.</hi> And the Reason
is exceeding strong; for, saith he, <hi>ye are bought with a
Price,</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 19. 20. He that redeems a Slave out
of <hi>Turkish</hi> Captivity, redeems him with this Intent, That
for the future he shall not do his own Will, but his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster's
that hath ransom'd him. The same we must think
of the Son of God, who, we may suppose, would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
have freed us from the Devil's Yoak by a voluntary
Death, to give us leave to do what we list; but that we
might be at his beck, and act like Persons that have, in
a manner, nothing to do with our selves, but are to mind
only what our Master who bought us would have us
do. Now, he that comes to this Sacrament without sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
Resolutions to obey Christ in those commanded
Virtues, which may cross, or go against his Interest,
discovers his Regret at the Mystery of Redemption, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes
Christ's redeeming him, for this End, that he might
not be his own, betrays his Wishes, and could have been
contented that he had redeemed him upon softer and
more favourable Terms; and, in a manner, declares
and expresses his Desire that he would be his own still,
after that wonderful Price that was paid for him; which,
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:103387:164"/>
though unthinking Men do take no notice of, yet he that
searcheth the inward parts of the Belly doth, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
look upon such a Person as a worthy Receiver.</p>
            <p>5. To eat and drink unworthily, is, <hi>to eat and drink
without a Speculative Esteem of Christ Jesus.</hi> Where Men
are not satisfied, or not persuaded that his Love deserves
sacrificing all to his Interest; and, in case Times of
Trouble and Persecution should come, are unresolved
to hate Father and Mother, Wife and Children, Lands
and Houses, even Life it self, for Christ; and with this
Irresoluteness come to this holy Sacrament; they cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
want that which must make them worthy Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.
For,</p>
            <p>1. He hath expresly told us, that <hi>he that loves Father
or Mother more than him, is not worthy of him,</hi> Matth. 10.
37. And if such a Person be not worthy of him, how
can be worthily receive him in the Sacrament? Not to
be worthy of him, is, to have no part in the <hi>Inheritance
incorruptible, undefiled, and reserved in Heaven for his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Servants.</hi> It is to have no Share in his Intercession,
no Right to his Comforts, no Right to the Act of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnity
he hath published for the Benefit of those who
adhere to him in all Dangers, no Right to his Promises,
no Right to the Privileges he communicates to those that
continue with him in his Temptations, no Right to the
exceeding Greatness of his Power towards them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.
And how can Christ dwell in such a Person, that
looks upon the Pelf of this World, and his outward Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodations,
as greater things than his Favour; that
is ashamed of him in a sinful and adulterous Generation;
and is more taken with the Things that are seen, than
with the Things which are not seen, though confirmed
by Divine Promises, and a Thousand Miracles? So that
it is evident, that he that comes not to this Sacrament
with Resolutions and Desires to value him above all, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be a very worthy Receiver.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="316" facs="tcp:103387:165"/>
2. Such a Person undervalues his miraculous Love,
and is supposed to esteem it no more than the Love of a
Servant, or the Love of an ordinary Friend. He doth
not value it as the Love of Him, in whose Power it lay
to make him everlastingly miserable; he values not the
unparallell'd Condescention that appears in it, the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
Humility that shines in it, the inexpressible Grace
and Favour that runs through the whole Frame; prefers
Dross and Dung before it, contrary to the Apostle's
Example, <hi>Phil. 3. 8.</hi> will not understand the Need he
has of Christ, nor the dreadful Consequences of his Sin;
nor what it is to be freed from the power of the Roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Lion,</hi> and from Condemnation, from Eternal Mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
and Lamentations, from being swallowed up by
the fierce Anger of the Lord: Mercies so great, and a
Love so much beyond all that this World affords, that
God thought the very hearing of it would make Men
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eap for Joy, and immediately leave all, and follow
<hi>Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. <hi>It is, to eat and drink without sincere Reconciliation to
our Neighbours,</hi> who have offended or provoked us to
Anger. Where either our Forgiveness is slight and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficial,
or we forbear to vent our Sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>een, and Malice,
and Ill-will, for a time, with an intent,
when a fair Opportunity offers it self,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>18. 14.</note>
to let the Party feel the weight of our
Anger; like <hi>Joab,</hi> who was a great
Master in the Art of dissembling, and could connive at
the Injury <hi>Absalom</hi> had done him, give him fair Words,
fawn upon him, and introduce him to the King; but
when a convenient time came, re-pay'd it home with a
witness. Where we are either averse from Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or make but a shew of it, and eat and drink at
this Table, we cannot be supposed to eat and drink
worthily. For,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="317" facs="tcp:103387:165"/>
1. In this Case, we can have no hope that God will
be reconciled to us, God's Reconciliation to Man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending
upon Man's reconciling himself to his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour;
so that where this is wanting, the other is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
as is evident from <hi>Matth. 18. 35.</hi> He that can
have no just Hope of God's being reconciled to him,
comes to this Sacrament to very little purpose; or if he
come with Hopes of his Favour, he must hope that God
will prove false to his Word; which can never make
him a worthy Receiver: So that his Hope can be no
other than that of the Hypocrite; the Character of
which we have, <hi>Job 8. 13, 14. His Hope shall be cut off,
and his Trust shall be as the Spider's Web. He shall lean upon
his House, but it shall not stand: He shall hold it fast, but it
shall not endure.</hi> An ill-grounded Hope must needs be a
bad Preparative for this Table, where nothing is so ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
as Sincerity; and both the Reconciliation and
the Hope of Mercy being destitute of this Qualification,
the Soul is under very ill Circumstances. <hi>A sound Hope,</hi>
we are told, <hi>makes not ashamed,</hi> Rom. 5. 5. The Hope
we speak of cannot but cause Shame and Confusion,
when God shall demand of us, how we could have the
Courage to hope for his Mercy, when he hath expresly
told us, that he is resolved to shew none, as long as we
are unacquainted with it, in Offences and Trespasses
committed against us by our Neighbours.</p>
            <p>2. Add to this, That a Person communicating under
such Circumstances, shews, he hath something that is
dearer to him than God's Reconciliation; even his Lust,
and Ill-Nature. And what is this, but to prefer Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
before Light; the Suggestions of the Devil, before
the Motions of God's Spirit; a blustering Passion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Meekness of the Holy <hi>Jesus;</hi> Bondage, before
the Freedom of the Gospel; and a Blast of Honour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the soft and <hi>still Voice</hi> of the Holy Ghost? 'Tis true,
If such Persons were asked whether they do so, they
would have the Confidence to deny it; for Men are
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:103387:166"/>
loth to have their Sins anatomiz'd, and drawn in their
native Colours; but God still judges of us by the tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and complexion of our Actions, not by the soft and
plausible Names we put upon them; and if our Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
speak so much, God passes his Verdict of them, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to what he finds at the bottom. Tho' we may
be unwilling to speak out, yet God is not afraid to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
what he sees, and finds; and therefore, where
Men will not be heartily reconciled, and yet venture
to Eat and Drink at this Table, God's judgment of us
can be no other than this, That our perverseness and ill
humor is dearer to us, than his being reconciled to our
Souls, and surely such a person cannot Eat and Drink
very worthily.</p>
            <p>7. <hi>It is to Eat and Drink without any serious Thoughts.</hi>
Where we come to this Table with Thoughts as loose,
as they were in a Tavern or Market place; where we
take no care to contract those Beams of our Minds, so as
to unite, and fix them on the Scene before us; or on som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
relating to it, whether it be our being Created af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Image of God, and our Apostacy from that state,
and the ruin and misery which came with that violent
Stream; or the great necessity of being renewed to that
Image, and the way that's opened to that Renovation
by the Blood of <hi>Jesus;</hi> or the Honour and Privileges
God offers us by his Son; or the advantages we receive
by being Christians, and having an interest in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits
of his Passion; or the Glory of the other World,
which we are made capable of, by the Death of him,
who was the Lord of Glory; or the Holy Ambition we
see in the Saints of old, to be made partakers of that
Glory; and their Industry and Care, and Pains, they
took to attain unto it, and the Joys they found in the
remembrance of Christ's Sufferings; or the Attributes of
God, his Wisdom, Holiness, Justice, Mercy, Power,
Love and Good-will to the Children of Men, all which
appears in the Sacrifice offer'd for us, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As these par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
are the most proper objects of our Thoughts at
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:103387:166"/>
such times, so he, that lets the thoughts of his Trade,
Business, and other worldly Concerns, to engross his
Understanding, and go in and out at their pleasure, doth
not come with that Respect and Reverence, requisite in
the participation of this Ordinance. Not but that such
Thoughts may accidentally, and by the wicked diligence
of evil Spirits, that always hover about us, invade the
Mind upon such occasions; but it's one thing, to be sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd
with such imaginations contrary to our design
and purpose, and another to give them Entertainment,
without any serious opposition of their importunity.
Not the later, but the former, makes the Communicant
an unworthy Receiver. For,</p>
            <p>1. Hereby the Holy Spirit is excluded from taking
possession of our Souls, a Guest the Soul hath reason to
make preparation for, and from whose Presence, it may
date its fruitfulness and happiness. Serious Thoughts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite
him to our House, and are the best attractives of
that Glorious Light<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> These are the Bed where he sows
his noble Seed, and on these, he moves more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
than he did on the Waters of the first Creation;
by these we caress illapses, and court his kinder irradia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
As God's Majesty is described, <hi>Psal. 104<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 3. That
he makes the Clouds his Chariot, and walks upon the Wings
of the Wind,</hi> so it may be said of Holy Thoughts in this
Sacrament, they are the Chariot and Vehicle, on which
the Spirit of the Holy <hi>Jesus</hi> makes his entrance into our
Soul<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> These dispose the Soul for his Gracious Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications,
and put her into a capacity of being Blessed
and Enlightned by him; where he spies these, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses
himself to the Soul, in the language of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Bridegroom, Cant. 5. 1. <hi>I am come into my Garden,
my Sister, my Spouse. I have gathered my Myrrhe with my
Spice: I have eaten my Hony-comb, with my Hony, I have
drank my Wine with my Milk: Eat, O friends; yea, drink
abundantly, my Beloved:</hi> Which are nothing but Rhetori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Expressions, of the Gracious Influences, the Spirit of
God is willing to confer on the Soul, that makes prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:103387:167"/>
for him, sweeps the House of the Rubbish of vain
Imaginations, and, by Pious Contemplation, makes the
Chamber ready for his Entertainment; and tho' these
Expressions run all in the strain of the Perfect Tense, yet,
in Holy Writ, the <hi>Perfect</hi> and the <hi>Future Tenses</hi> are used
promiscuously; and as the <hi>Future</hi> many times stands for
the <hi>Perfect,</hi> so the <hi>Perfect Tense</hi> very often stands for the
<hi>Future,</hi> and the future Blessings are expressed by what
is past, to assure us of the certainty of them, and that
the Soul hath no more reason to doubt of them, than if
it did already actually enjoy then.</p>
            <p>2. Want of serious Thoughts is a kind of prophana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this Ordinance. Profanation of Holy Things,
consists not only in reviling and reproaching, or actual
perverting them, to what is ill and forbidden; but also
in not using of them with that decency and seriousness,
which ought to be the proper Concomitants of them.
The Jews therefore, <hi>Mal. 1. 12, 13.</hi> are said to profane
the House of the Lord, not because they turned it, as
their Fore-fathers, into a Den of Thieves, or Mansion
of Idolatry; but because they did not bring suitable Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
and those, they brought, were brought with
an unwilling Mind; and they look'd upon the Service
of God, as tedious and wearisome, and did not offer
such Incense as was pure, nor such Sacrifices as were
whole and sound, and without blemish. And certainly,
not only he prophanes God's Name, that tears it with
his Oaths, and Curses, and Blasphemies, but he also, that
gives it not the Honour that is due to it: Profanation
of the Lord's Day, is not only to sit Drinking and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling
at home, or to spend it in Play and Sports, and
Pastimes, and Rioting and Drunkenness, but not to san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie
it by publick and private Devotion; and if so, not
to bring Holy Thoughts to this Ordinance, to the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar
of God, and to the Cross of Christ, must be a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanation
of these Mysteries, as he that puts no Oil to
the Lamp, extinguishes its Light, as much as he that
blows it out. Holy Thoughts are part of that Honour
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:103387:167"/>
and Veneration we owe to this Ordinance; and as Men
count it an affront, not only to be beaten, but not to
have that respect given them, which is due to their Rank
and Quality, so God hath for greater reason to look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it, as a profanation of this Sacrament, where Men
bring not with them Thoughts pertinent to the Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
and Holiness of the wonderful Things manifested
and represented here; and he that profanes this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
cannot be supposed to Eat and Drink wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily.</p>
            <p>IV. But it is not enough to give an exact description
of the Sin: the danger of it, is the next thing we must
speak of: And this, <hi>St. Paul</hi> says, <hi>1 Cor. 11. 27.</hi> is, <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
our selves guilty of the Body and Blood of the Lord.</hi> A
great guilt certainly! to be counted a <hi>murtherer</hi> of the
Son of God, and to be reckon'd among <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels,</hi>
that embru'd their hands in the Blood of the ever
Blessed Jesus; for so much the Apostle's words import;
and if the unworthy Receiver incurs this guilt, he needs
no other argument to discourage him from his Sin and
Impiety. The Charge is dreadful; nor must we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
think, that it is only spoke, <hi>in Terrorene,</hi> to fright Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
as we terrifie Children, with strange things; not
that there are such things in being, but to make them
desist from their unlucky Enterprize or Frowardness.
No, God need not make use of Bugbears, nor must we
imagine, that what he saith, hath the least shadow of
untruth. As dreadful as this Charge is, he means what
he says, and speaks what he thinks, and unworthy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
is neither more nor less, than making our selves
guilty of the Body and Bl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>d of the Lord Jesus: And
how this is done by him that Eats and Drinks unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily,
deserves consideration.</p>
            <p>1. He that Eats and Drinks unworthily, <hi>makes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
guilty of denying, that the Body and Blood of Christ was
sacrific'd for him.</hi> As they that dishonour the Christian
R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ligion, by their covetousness, and unrighteousness,
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:103387:168"/>
and lewd practices, are said, <hi>To deny the Lord that bought
them, 2 Pet. 2. 1.</hi> because they live, as if Christ had
not bought them, or had not redeem'd them from Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity:
So the <hi>unworthy Receiver,</hi> being loth to mortifie
his known and voluntary Sins, even in the act of Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
denies that Christ was Sacrific'd for him. His
unwillingness to reform, is a tacit denial of the Mercy,
and a Sign that he doth not believe it heartily: For the
Holy Ghost supposes, that he, who believes it with any
seriousness, will be affected with it, and stand amaz'd
at this Act of God, even at this infinite, immense<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>searchable
and incomprehensible Love: that he who needs
not the society of Men or Angels, and can be Etenally
happy without them, should yet have that value and
respect for Mankind, who were his Prisoners, and had
forfeited their Lives to his Justice, were the objects of
his Wrath, and had justly deserv'd to be banish'd from
his Gracious Presence for ever, as to find out a remedy,
whereby they might be restored to his Favour, freed
from their slavish Condition, and admitted to his Bosom,
and such a Remedy, as might at once assert his Justice,
and declare his Mercy, and, in order thereunto, free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
generously, and without compulsion, part with the
Eternal Son of his Bosom, prepare a Body for him,
a Body which might be capable of Dying, and fall a
Sacrifice at once; assert God's just Anger against Sin,
and keep off the fatal blow from Man; at once defend
God'ds Right, and establish Man's Felicity, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
put the poor miserable Worm in a capacity of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
Heir to the Riches of God, who was an Heir
of the Treasures of Wrath; and a companion of Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Spirits, who had deserv'd to howl with Apostate
Spirits; a Child of Light, who was a Son of Darkness;
and a Servant of Righteousness, who was a Slave of Sin.
I say, the Holy Ghost supposes, that he that seriously be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves
all this, will think nothing too good for God, will
not stand out against so great a Mercy, will fight no
more against so great and so good a Master, but will
submit to him, be ready to run at his Commands; give
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:103387:168"/>
himself up to the Will of so great a Benefactor, and will
be hearty and sincere in serving him. Now, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
Receiver being so far from doing this, so far
from turning to God with all his heart, and with all his
mind, that he refuses the Dominion of God, will be a
Slave to his Sin still, and had rather obey the Devil,
than this most bountiful Master, who hath done so much
for him; by doing so, denies that Christ's Body and
Blood was sacrific'd for him; for if he believ'd it, he
could not do as he doth; and tho' he may protest by
all that's Good and Sacred, that he believes it, yet Words
and Compliments will not absolve him; and if talking
were believing, no Man, that professes Christianity,
would ever be damn'd: What doth a Malefactor's plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at the Bar, that he is not guilty, signifie, when the
Evidences are strong, and the Matter of Fact is prov'd
against him? Belief, that doth not touch the Heart, or
renew the Mind, or spiritualize the Affections, is mere
Infidelity; and where this Belief is not to be found, the
Sinner is accused of denying the Mercy he pretends to
believe: And to this purpose, saith the Apostle, <hi>They pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
that they know God, but in their works they deny him,</hi>
Tit. 1. 16. So that the unworthy Receiver, <hi>i. e.</hi> He that
receives, and yet will not reform, whatever his Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
may be, in his Actions he denies, that Christ was
Sacrific'd for him; and therefore makes himself guilty
of the Body and Blood of the Lord.</p>
            <p>2. He Eats and Drinks unworthily, <hi>makes himself guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of jesting with the Body and Blood of Christ;</hi> As the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of the Council of <hi>Eliberis</hi> speak: He
plays with the most tremendous things,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Council.</hi> Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. <hi>c.</hi> 3. Ne lusisse de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communione Dominicâ vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deantur.</note>
for, in coming, he seems to confess, that
by the Death of the Son of God, his mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Soul was redeem'd, and a Pardon
purchas'd for him, and the Heavens made
to bow to him, and the good Will of God procur'd, to
save him for ever, and yet he doth not think all this
worth forsaking a sinful Lust, or shaking a pleasing
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:103387:169"/>
               <hi>Dalilah</hi> from his Bosom; and what is this, but playing
with the Body and Blood of <hi>Christ?</hi> Should a Man make
a very curious Harangue in commendation of his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
compare him with <hi>Salomon,</hi> for Wisdom; with
<hi>David,</hi> for Sincerity; with <hi>Jonathan,</hi> for Faithfulness;
with <hi>Josiah,</hi> for Piety; for Generosity, with <hi>Moses;</hi> for
Chastity, with <hi>Joseph;</hi> for Patience, with <hi>Job;</hi> with
<hi>St. Paul,</hi> for Courage; with <hi>St. Peter,</hi> for Zeal; with
<hi>Absolom,</hi> for Beauty; with <hi>Zacheus</hi> for Charity; with
<hi>Abraham,</hi> for Hospitality; nay, with Angels for clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Understanding; and for Purity of Life, with <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphim:</hi>
And when he hath done, abuse and reproach
him, or do that, which he cannot but know, must be
offensive and irksome, or prejudicial to him, gives the
Spectator just occasion to think, that all that flanting
Panegyric was only a jocular thing, design'd rather as
an essay of Wit, than as any real affection to the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
of the commended Party. The unworthy Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
doth in effect the same; for, his coming to this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
is a tacit Commendation of <hi>Christ</hi>'s Crucified
Body and Blood, whereby he seems to applaud the
wonderful Works that <hi>Christ</hi> hath done for him, and to
proclaim to all the standers by, what an Obligation that
Death is, to mortifie the body of Sin, and to be true
and faithful to him, that did not count his Life dear,
to do him good; and yet having no real purpose with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
whatever external Declaration he may make, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a new Man; but after he hath been at this Table,
when temptations assault him, temptations to his former
sins, yields to them as easily as ever, plainly declares, he
was in <hi>jest,</hi> when he seem'd to magnifie this Munifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
of his Saviour; and from hence it must follow,
that he is guilty of playing with the Body and Blood
of <hi>Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3, He that Eats and Drinks unworthily, <hi>seems to
wish that Christ may dye again,</hi> and upon that account,
is guilty of the Body and Blood of the Lord; for in
that Christ's Death is not efficacious to pull down the
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:103387:169"/>
strong holds of Sin in him, or rather, in that he will not
let that death prevail with him, to the mortifying of his
sinful Lusts, he seems to wish for an iteration of that
Death, which may be more powerful, and have a greater
influence upon the destruction of his Sin. It is a Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
as it were, that the Death of Christ, as the case
stands, doth no good upon him; and therefore, since the
Death of the Son of God must be the means to break the
power of Sin in him, he stands in need of another death
of that Saviour, which may do greater miracles upon
his Soul, or sinful Temper. Christ's Death, indeed, must
break the reigning power of Sin; but then, a Person,
in whom this effect is to be wrought, must apply that
Death, think upon it, warm his Heart with the Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of it, ruminate upon the Motives of it, and
upon the greatness of his own Sin, that occasioned it,
and upon the vast Advantages that flow from that Death,
and be restless with God, to make it effectual to his
Soul: For to think that this Death will do the work
without our Labour or Industry, or pondering the weight
and moment of it, is to imagine, that God will deal
with us, as with Brutes, that have no understanding.
As Christ died once in the end of the World, so his
Death spreads his Virtue to all Penitents, from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
to the end of the World. But wherever it works
a serious Reformation, it must be improv'd by Faith, and
Thoughts, and Prayer, and Contemplation; and should
Christ dye a thousand times, if these means be neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
his dying so often would signifie little to the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderate
Spectator. This is the monstrous Fancy of some
Men, that they hope, the Mysteries of Religion will,
or must change their Hearts, without any trouble of
their own; which Conceit must needs make them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible
in the sight of an All-wise God, who sees
them neglect the Powers and Faculties he hath given
them. The unworthy Receiver therefore, finding no
good by this Death of the Lord Jesus, for it makes no
alteration in his Life for the better, looks, as it were,
for a new Sacrifice for Sin; and since he will not be
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:103387:170"/>
purged from his known Sins, by the Blood of Jesus,
which hath been already spilt, if he hath any hopes of
being purified from his Sin, in order to the obtaining
of Eternal Happiness, seems to desire a more effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Death of that great Mediator, which may, against
his Will, drag him away from his sinful courses, and
thereby would have Christ suffer, and be kill'd again;
and consequently, makes himself guilty of the Body
and Blood of the Lord.</p>
            <p>4. He that Eats and Drinks unworthily, <hi>kills the Lord
Jesus:</hi> You will say, This is impossible, <hi>Christ</hi> being in
Heaven, and incapable of any such Act of Violence. No
more could <hi>Saul,</hi> if you understand it according to the
Letter, <hi>persecute him,</hi> after he was glorified; yet the voice
that came to him, in his way to <hi>Damascus,</hi> said, <hi>Saul, Saul,
why persecutest thou me? Act. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. 4.</hi> The same may be said
of an unworthy Receiver, he cannot, strictly speaking,
kill the Lord Jesus; yet being unwilling to venture up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a change of Life, under all the Abjurations of a
bleeding Redeemer, that stubborness is Death to <hi>Christ,</hi>
as God said to the Jews, <hi>Ezek. 6. 9. I am broken with
your whorssh Heart:</hi> So may the Saviour of the World
cry to the Communicant, that comes to remember his
Death, and will not die to his known Sins, <hi>Thou piercest,
thou woundest, thou killest me, by thy obstinate and refractory
temper,</hi> as we say of a tender Father, that the ill course
his disobedient Son takes, is death to him, because it is as
grievous to him, as if one should attempt to take away
his Life. The unworthy Receiver, by being loth to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
to the Rules of the Gospel in his Practices, even
while he beholds, as it were, Christ Crucified for his
Sins, does an Act so unworthy, so disrespectful, so inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
that it is as much, as if he made attempts upon his
Life; nay, he kills the preventing Grace <hi>Christ</hi> affords
him, and slays the good motions whereby <hi>Christ</hi> lives in
him. Christ is said to be in us, as we are Christians;
and the unworthy Receiver, being desirous and willing
to maintain and keep his darling Sins, doth thereby
drive <hi>Christ</hi> out of his Heart, and kill him in his own
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:103387:170"/>
Soul; for <hi>Christ,</hi> and Love to a sinful Life, are inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent
and incompatible things. These destroy his Life
in the Soul; and therefore, in this Sense also, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
Receiver makes himself guilty of the Body and
Blood of the Lord.</p>
            <p>5. He that eats and drinks unworthily, <hi>consents to the
Murther the</hi> Jews <hi>were guilty of</hi> when they killed the Lord
of Life, and approves of that barbarous and inhumane
Act; and therefore is <hi>guilty of the Body and Blood of the
Lord.</hi> He is supposed to consent to that Murther, that
is not sorry for if: And how can he be sorry for it, that
is not sorry for his Sins, which were the principal Cause
of it? The unworthy Receiver being supposed to be
one that doth not heartily shake hands with a sinful Life,
and is loth so to renounce his known Sins, as to tear
them from his Heart; we cannot imagine that he is hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
sorry for them, for his Sorrow hath not those Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
which <hi>Godly Sorrow</hi> is said to have, <hi>2 Cor. 7. 11. For
this same thing, when ye sorrowed after a Godly sort, what
Carefulness it wrought in you! Yea, what clearing of your
selves! Yea, what Indignation against Sin! Yea, what Fear,
i. e.</hi> of offending God! <hi>Yea, what vehement Desire! Yea,
what Zeal! Yea, what Revenge!</hi> The Tree is known by
its Fruits: And if Sorrow for Sin must be discovered by
such Effects, and these Effects appear not in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municant;
as he cannot be thought to eat and drink
worthily, so in not being sorry for his Sins, he doth not
appear sorry for the Murther the <hi>Jews</hi> committed upon
the Body of our Saviour; his Sins being the Cause of
that Murther. And doth not this look like Consent, or
Approbation of that Murther? You will say, How can
any Man be sorry for Christ's Death, when that Death
is our greatest Comfort; and what Consolations the
pious Soul feels, it feels by virtue of that Death? Shall
a Man be sorry for that, which God had ordain'd, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
and design'd for the Relief and Redress of our
Misery? If Christ had not died, we had been ever
wretched and unhappy, and must have looked for no
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:103387:171"/>
Friendship from above; and therefore, to charge Men
with being guilty of his Death, because they are not sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
for it, seems to be both against Scripture and Reason.
Is any Man sorry for a Treasure he finds in the Field?
Or sorry for an Estate that falls to him by the Decease
of a Relation? Or sorry for an Act of Oblivion which
a gracious Prince imparts to Offenders, whereof himself
is the Principal? But to this, the Answer is very easie;
for the Benefit of Christ's Death, and the Mercy God
intended Mankind by it, must be carefully distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from the Instrumental Causes whereby Christ was
brought to his Death; which were, partly our Sins, and
the barbarous Cruelty of the <hi>Jews.</hi> The Benefit that
came by the Death of Christ, a Christian, most certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
ought not to be sorry for, but hath reason to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
in, Day and Night: But that he was so inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manely
murther'd by the <hi>Jews,</hi> and that our Sins were
such abominable things in the Sight of God, that, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piate
them, God was moved to give up his own Son to
the lawless Rage of those cruel Enemies; this requires
our Grief and Sorrow. That the <hi>Jews</hi> did commit a
very heinous Sin in crucifying Christ, is evident from
St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Discourse, or Sermon, to the Murtherers, <hi>Act.
3. 17, 18, 19.</hi> For, though God hath decreed that Death,
as an Expedient to reconcile Man to himself, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed
not to hinder the <hi>Jews</hi> in pursuing their wicked
Designs and Purposes, but to make that Death an Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote
against Everlasting Death; yet that doth not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
the <hi>Jews</hi> from the Guilt of Sin in killing of him,
whose Cruelty God was resolved to turn to the Good of
all true Penitents, and sincere Believers; nor a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
from an hearty Sorrow, that his Sins were the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
Cause of it. So that a Christian may at once
rejoyce in Christ's Death, and be sorry for it; rejoyce
in the unspeakable Mercies procured by it, and be sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
that those stubborn Wretches did with that Cruelty
dispatch him; or rather, that his Sins did arm those de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate
Sinners to put the Lord of Life to death; for the
<hi>Jews</hi> could have had no power to murther him, but
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:103387:171"/>
that the Sins of Mankind, crying aloud for Vengeance,
enabled them, and gave them Strength, and ministred
Occasion to do it. So that he that is not heartily sorry
for his Sins, is not heartily sorry that the <hi>Jews</hi> did mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
him; and therefore, the unworthy Receiver, not
being heartily sorry for the Sins he hath lived in, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents
to that Murther of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and, upon that Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
makes himself guilty of the Body and Blood of
the Lord. Our Church therefore, in her <hi>Confession</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> obliges all those that come to receive
to say, <hi>We do earnestly repent, and are heartily sorry for these
our Mis-doings.</hi> Now, he that is heartily sorry for his
known Sins, will watch and strive against them, and
take heed he doth not, through Carelesness, rush into
them again; which the unworthy Receiver not being
from the Heart resolved to do, involves himself in that
Guilt we speak of.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The Preceding Considerations reduced to Practice.</head>
               <p>I. HEre I cannot but take notice of the great Errour
of the First Council of <hi>Toledo,</hi> celebrated about
the Year 400. after Christ, which made a <hi>Canon,</hi> that
<hi>he who had no Wife, but, instead of a Wife, a Concubine,
ought not to be kept or debarred from the holy Communion,
provided that he content himself with one Concubine, and add
no more.</hi> 'Tis evident that such a Conjunction is Filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Uncleanness, condemned by the <hi>Apostle, Gal.
5. 19.</hi> Marriage it is not; and Carnal Copulations
without it, are mere Fornications; as we see, <hi>Heb. 13. 4.</hi>
And therefore such Persons, if admitted to the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
could not but eat and drink unworthily. Nor
doth it mend the matter, that <hi>Leo I.</hi> Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
of that Canon; for that only shews, that Popes
are as fallible as other Men; nay, more subject to mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take,
as they are very jealous of their Riches, and Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur,
and Temporal Interest. <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> to excuse this
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:103387:172"/>
Fault, alledges, that by Concubine in that Canon, was
meant, nothing but a lawful Wife, only married, and
taken without a Portion, or publick Solemnity. But
this Conjecture must be false, because, both in the <hi>Civil</hi>
and <hi>Canon-Laws,</hi> Concubines are Persons distinguished
from lawful Wives, and but a better Name for Whores.
And as that <hi>Concil</hi> did very ill to admit such Persons
that were known to live in such Sins to the Sacrament,
so they did as ill to prohibit Ministers Widows,
if they married again,<note place="margin">Cap. 8.</note> or took a second Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
the use of the Communion; as if an honst Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
were more scandalous than Fornication. And
though a Bishop or Pastor of the Church is ordered by
the Apostle, <hi>1 Tim. 3. 2.</hi> to be <hi>the Husband of one Wife,</hi>
yet how doth it follow from thence, that his Widow,
when he dies, must never marry again?</p>
               <p>II. There is a great difference betwixt Receiving un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily,
and being unworthy to receive, Every Man
that thinks himself unworthy to receive these Mysteries,
is not therefore an unworthy Receiver. Alas! If we go
to the Worthiness of the Person that comes to this Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
Who of us can be said to be worthy to come before
so holy, so jealous, so great a God? Or, Who of us is
worthy of that incomprehensible and diffusive Love, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
to us in this Ordinance? If we reflect on the
marvellous Purity of the Divine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>Nature, Who of us can

reason to cry out, at the sight of that Tremendous Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness,
<hi>Unclean, Unclean:</hi> There are few of us, who have
not reason to complain, (to use the Words of <hi>Thomas de
Kempis)</hi> that they are yet so carnal, so worldly, so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortified
in their Passions, so full of disorderly Motions
of the Flesh, so unwatchful over their outward Senses,
so often entangled with vain Thoughts and Fancies, so
vehemently inclined to external Comforts, so negligent
of the Ornament of a meek and quiet Spirit, so prone
to immoderate Laughter and Immodesty, so indisposed
to Tears and Compunction, so strongly inclined to the
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:103387:172"/>
Ease and Pleasures of the Flesh, so dull to Strictness and
an holy Zeal, so curious to hear News, and to see gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
Sights; so slack to embrace what is humble and low,
so covetous of Abundance, so niggardly in giving to pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Uses, so close in keeping what Providence hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
upon them, so inconsiderate in speaking, so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridled
to Silence, so loose in Manners, so covetous af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Gain, so greedy after the Meat which perishes, so
deaf to the Word of God, so apt to sit still, so slow to
labour, so watchful to idle Tales, so drowsie in God's
Service, so hasty to make an end of their Prayers, so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constant
in Attention, so cold in Devotion, so unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout
in the holy Communion, so quickly discomposed,
so seldom wholly gathered into themselves, so suddenly
provoked to Anger, so ready to take Displeasure at their
Neighbour's Actions, so prone to judge, so severe in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension,
so jolly in Prosperity, so impatient in Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity,
so often purposing much Good, and yet perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
little. There are very few of us, who have not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to deplore such Defects as these; and then, Who can
be worthy to feast with the King Invisible, Immortal,
Blessed for evermore? But it is God that makes us wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy:
He will not count us unworthy if we strive against
these Errours, if we labour to conquer them, if we will
not be Friends with them, if we proclaim War against
them, if we are resolved, whatever we venture, to be
rid of them, if we will not hug them in our Bosoms, if
we will open the Everlasting Doors, and let the King
of Glory come in; if we will hate what he hates, and
love what he loves, and will continue our Hostility a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
those Lusts which interfere with his just Right and
Prerogative. He will not go to the utmost rigour with
us. He will deal gently with us, liker a Father, than a
Judge. To let us go on in our Offences, without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morse,
or a serious Care to please him, he cannot; and
such is his Holiness, that he must not. He considers our
Frame, that we are Dust; and therefore will not take
advantage of every accidental Miscarriage: But he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siders
withal, that he hath given us his Gospel, and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:103387:173"/>
Motives, and his Holy Spirit, whereby we
may certainly master the Corruptions we find stirring in
us, though not immediately, yet by degrees; if we are but
willing, and labour, and wrestle, and are active, and
do not suffer our selves to be overcome by Laziness, and
the Satisfactions of this present World: And upon these
Terms, he is willing to count us worthy Receivers. O
Sweetness incomparable! O Condescention ineffable!
beyond all that Kings and Princes express to their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects!
What Christian that is acquainted with this Frame,
this Spirit, this humble and tractable Temper, this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution,
and this Willingness, and that feels these Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
in his Soul, can, after all this, forbear coming,
upon a pretence of being unworthy? Coming to this
holy Table with such Purposes, with such Designs, with
such Qualifications, let him be confident that his Father,
his Saviour, his Redeemer will bid him welcome. This
spiritual Frame, <hi>Christian,</hi> will make thee worthy: Thou
comest not to this Sacrament to give God any thing,
but to receive a Blessing from him: Thou comest not
hither to contribute any thing to his Happiness, but to
open thy Mouth wide, that he may fill it: Thou comest
not hither to proclaim thy Perfections, but to have thy
Imperfections supplied: Thou comest not hither to boast
of thy Cleanness, but to be washed from their Sins:
Thou comest not hither to glory in thy Merits, but to
receive an Alms at thy great Master's Hands; his Grace,
his Love, his Compassion will make thee worthy: Thou
comest not to give him an Account of thy Riches, but
as an hungry Beggar, that wants Bread, to feed on the
hidden <hi>Manna.</hi> All that is required of thee, is, to look
upon thy Redeemer as thy greatest Friend, and to use
him like a Friend, to make his Friendship an Enforcive
to love him; and so to love him, as to hearken to his
Counsels, to be govern'd by his Directions, to bid fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel
to all things that will destroy that Friendship, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
of thy Unkindnesses to him, and to prefer his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
before that of Flesh and Blood; to hearken to his
Instructions, more than to the false Suggestions of the
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:103387:173"/>
World; and so to remember that thy Sins have contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
to his Crucifixion, as to punish them with Frowns
and Mortifications. If thou art willing to this, he will
supply thy Defects, he will satisfie thy hungry Soul, he
will feed thee from his Storehouse, and make thy Soul
Partaker of his purchased Possession: Let not thy Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthiness
discourage thee. 'Tis confessed thou art a
poor, vile Worm, a Sinner, a wretched Creature, not
worthy of the least of all his Mercies, not worthy to be
taken notice of, not worthy of the least Glimpse of his
Favour; but still, if he is pleased to count and esteem
thee worthy, it is Contempt of his Love if thou dost
not accept of this gracious Offer, and come and li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t up
thine Hands towards his holy Oracle. If thou wilt but
look upon thy Sins as Enemies; and if they do assault
thee, wilt vigorously oppose thy self against their At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts;
and if they do surprize thee once or twice, wilt
renew thy Courage against them, and do any thing ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than yield to them, and set up this Resolution in
thy Heart, that the Lord shall be thy God, thou shalt
be worthy; he will give thee Grace, which shall make
thee worthy: His Flesh shall nourish thy Soul; his
Blood shall enrich the Ground of thy Heart; his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
shall give thee Life; his Assistance will make thee
spiritual; his Spirit will enable thee to rejoyce in him
that made thee, make thee a worthy Conqueror, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of the Tree of Life, and worthy of that Pardon he
hath purchased for thee on the Cross, <hi>when in his own
Body he bore thy Sins upon the Tree, that thou being dead to
Sin, mightest live unto God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>III. Among the various sorts of Persons that are loth
to come to this holy Sacrament, those betray strange
Imprudence, as well as Obstinacy, that are loth to part
with their Sins, and therefore are loth to come, for fear
they should eat and drink unworthily, and make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
guilty of the Body and Blood of the Lord, and
eat and drink their won Damnation. But, O Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Vipers! Who hath told you that this is the way
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:103387:174"/>
to escape the Wrath to come? Who hath been so wise,
as to inform you, that this way you may flee from the
Indignation of the Lord? In what Scripture have you
read, that your not coming to this Sacrament, because
you are loth to prophane it by your Sins, will save you
from Perdition? 'Tis very true, and you are in the right,
when you suppose, that your Refractoriness to Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Amendment, makes you unworthy Receivers:
But can you imagine that you are ever a whit the safer
for not coming? Will not the Sins you live and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
in, do your Work for you, and make you Heirs of
Damnation? The wilful Neglect of this Sacrament is a
damnable Sin: And can you think that your not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
will make your Condition more easie and tolerable?
'Tis true, you pretend you will not prophane it, and
therefore do not come: You are sensible it requires Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation;
and because your Circumstances will not
permit you to lead better Lives, you are loth to add to
your Danger, by eating and drinking unworthily. But
when your not coming to this Sacrament makes you mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable,
as well as your coming and receiving unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily,
'tis strange that the Point of adding some Grains
to the Bulk of your Misery, should make you afraid of
coming. I will not deny, but Eating and Drinking un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily
doth, in some measure, aggravate the Evil a
Man lives in, because he adds Scorn to his Impiety; but
as long as his Impenitence without coming, and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
unworthily, do both involve him in the Danger of
Damnation, it is a foolish Plea, to preted you dare not
come, for fear of aggravating your Condemnation; as
if Damnation were tolerable, and the Degrees of it on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
intolerable. But we see what you drive at: You
hope, some time before you die, and when you will
not have those Opportunities of sinning that now you
have, you may receive it, and save your Souls at last.
But to hear Men talk of what they shall do hereafter,
when they have not one Minute of their Lives at their
Command, is so ridiculous, that it needs no Answer.
This is certain; your Sins are sweet, and your evil Lives
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:103387:174"/>
make you fit to live in the World, and therefore you will
not come. But will this Argument hold Water, do you
think, when God shall plead with you? Surely, your
Sins are very precious things, that you dare refuse com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to this holy Ordinance for them. The Scripture
calls them Filth and Poyson; for so they are in the Eyes
of an holy God: And are they dearer to you, than the
Love of God? They are perfect Leprosie: And had
had you rather be full of Sores and Boyls, than come
hither to be made clean? They crucified your Saviour:
And will you keep that which murther'd him? They
are the Disgrace and Reproach of your Souls: And will
you delight in your Infamy? They are the things that
separate betwixt a glorious God and you: And will you
uphold that fatal Distance and Separation? They ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
you from the Kingdom of Heaven: And will you
be content with that Exclusion? Are you wise and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
Men: And will you not open your Eyes,
and see your Danger? What do you call Contempt of
God, if this be not it? What do you call slighting of
Incomprensible Mercy, if this do not deserve that Name?
Can you hope for God's Pardon at last, that refuse to
accept of it in this Ordinance? Do you believe you have
Souls, and that it is your Interest to secure them against
Mischief: And will you prefer a few airy, volatile Joys
before their Safety? Sinner, When is it that thou dost
intend to reform? Is it when an angry God looks thee
in the Face, and an evil Conscience upon thy Death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
presages thy future Torments? Is it possible that an
offended God will then fly into thy Embraces, whom
thou didst not care for all thy Days? Behold, in this
Sacrament, the Son of God doth not only offer to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile
thee to thy God, but shews thee the way too,
how it shall be effected to thy Content and Satisfaction:
Here he offers to enrol thy Name among the Friends of
God; but it is impossible to make thee God's Friend,
while thou maintainest thy Enmity against him: To
leave thy Sins, and to come to this Sacrament, are one
and the same thing; these two are inseparable, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:103387:175"/>
them, is, to divide Light from Fire; which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
Impossibility. Oh, think therefore! Till I come
to this Ordinance, God will be my Foe; and should I be
snatch'd away while God is so, who will plead for me
when I come to appear before God? <hi>I will arise there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and go to my Father,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>IV. As squeamish as some Sinners are, there are others
that dare come and receive unworthily, and be guilty
of the Body and Blood of the Lord, and be no more
concern'd, than if they had committed any trivial or
indifferent Action: Such are they who are the same af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
they have received, as they were before; vitious be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and vitious after; revengeful, lascivious, unclean,
malicious, proud, Boasters, intemperate, Back-biters,
implacable, unmerciful before, and after too; nor doth
the threatning that they make themselves guilty of the
Body and Blood of the Lord Jesus fright or discompose
them. Lord! How stupid a thing is Sin! How hard,
how insensible doth it make the Heart! What Venom
doth it shed upon the Soul! Who would imagine that
Men could be so perverse, Men that live under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
too, as to be guilty of murthering Christ? Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
of Christ! You will say, Who can murther
him now he is in Glory? What Bug-bears are these, to
fright poor silly, ignorant People with? So easily do
Men slide from Hypocrisie, into Prophaneness; and
from Prophaneness, into the Scorner's Chair! But,
What if Christ be in Heaven, and out of the reach of
thy Baseness and Malice? If Christ interpret thy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
in known Sins, after thou hast been viewing
his Death and Crucifixion in this Sacrament, as mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
of him; how great, how heinous, and of how
deep a Dye must thy Sins be! What Guilt, what Loads,
what Mountains of Wrath must we suppose, dost thou
lay, and pull down on thy Shoulders! Who can tell so
well the venomous Influences and Tendencies of thy
Sins, as he that perfectly understands the poysonous na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of it? If he saith, that it amounts to murthering of
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:103387:175"/>
him, Will thy laughing at the Conceit excuse thy Folly
when his Anger shall be kindled? Need he value thy
Flouts and Jeers, that hath Flames and Vengeance at
command, to lash thee into better Manners? It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
he should be mistaken in his Verdict of things:
And wilt thou say, he doth not speak what is true?
Art thou wiser than he; Or dost thou see farther into
things than he? Must his Wisdom be modell'd by thy
shallow Reason; Or shall a Creature dispute the Oracle
of its Creator? If he sees and knows that thy wilful
Impenitence runs so high, as to make an Attempt upon
his Life again, wilt not thou believe him, or darest
thou charge him with a Lye? The Holy Ghost, speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> protests so much: And wilt thou add
sinning against the Holy Ghost to all thy Offences?
Believe it, Sinner; 'tis Death to the Lord of Life, to
see a Creature, for whom he took such pains, wallow
still in those Sins after Receiving, which he was suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to abjure in Receiving. 'Tis Death to him, to see
thee more tender of keeping thy Word with a Man that
must die, than with him that lives for ever. 'Tis Death
to him, to see thee wilful in breaking that solemn Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
thou madest under his Cross, and didst seal with
drinking of his Blood. Thou dost in this Sacrament
make a Covenant with him, and oblige thy self, as thou
hopest to have a share in his Merits, that thou wilt be
guided and governed by <hi>him,</hi> who, to the Astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Men and Angels, died for thee, (and there
cannot be a more sacred Tye;) and to see thee violate
that Oath, and break through that Vow, into Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
into that Damnation from which he came to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scue
thee; this is Death to him, and a new Attempt
upon his Life; and if thou darest be so barbarous, so
inhumane, as to do so, Heaven and Earth will be Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
against thee; and that very Blood which thou
prophanest, will be a Witness against thee; and all the
Saints that see thee prophane that Blood, will be Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
against thee; and it is enough to make the
Lord repent that ever he died for such a Wretch. O
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:103387:176"/>
then, play not with these Mysteries; for <hi>it will be hard
for thee to kick against the Pricks.</hi> But,</p>
               <p>V. Let the worthy Receiver rejoyce in the midst of
all these Terrours. These Thunder-bolts do not reach
him. These Threatnings do not concern him. He is
safe under all these Storms: They will not fall on him,
to crush him. These Hail-stones will not bruise his
Head: This Weight will not sink him. He can pass
through all these Messengers of Death, and fear no E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil:
Even he, who sees greater Comfort in a crucified
Saviour, than in this gaudy World; and can admire
the Mercies purchased by his Death, while others stand
gazing on stately Buildings, and sumptuous Palaces:
Even he, who makes Conscience of performing what
he promises to a glorious God; and feels Desires in his
Breast to be more and more conformable to the holy
Life and Example of <hi>Christ Jesus;</hi> and to whom no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
is so dear as that of a crucified Saviour, who loves
as he loves, without Hypocrisie or Dissimulation. Let
such a Soul be glad in the Lord, and believe, that God
will command his Loving-kindness in the Day-time,
and in the Night will cover him with the Shadow of
his Wings. Let him not be disquieted, nor think God
hath forgotten him, when his Soul is bowed down to
the Dust, and his Belly cleaves unto the Earth: <hi>Christ,</hi>
the Son of God, will certainly manifest himself unto
him, be present with him, pour Grace into his Heart,
and Comfort into his Soul; give himself to him, be his
Hiding-place, compass him about with the Songs of
Deliverance, and say unto him, <hi>I will instruct thee, and
teach thee in the Way which thou shalt go: I will guide thee
with mine Eye.</hi> Such a Person receives Christ indeed,
receives him with all his Blessings, and with all the Spoils
he recovered of the Enemy: He receives him with all
the Wealth he hath fought for, and purchased with his
B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ood. He receives him with all the precious things
he hath laboured for in the Sweat of his Brows. He
receives <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>im laden, and abounding with glorious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:103387:176"/>
which shall, by degrees, be all fulfilled in him;
for they belong to him, they are his Right, they are
his Portion; Christ will make him worthy to receive
them. He shall ask, and his Master will give: He
shall seek, and find too: He shall knock, and the Lord
Jesus will answer; and though he may knock often,
yet, at last, the Gates will be opened to him. The
Everlasting Door, the Gate of Grace and Mercy shall
be unlocked to him, and he shall get more Grace,
greater Strength, larger Influences; his Incomes shall
be greater, his Revenues more plentiful: He will open
the Windows of Heaven to him, and refresh his Ground
with kindly Showers; <hi>They shall drop on the Pastures of
the Wilderness, and the little Hills shall rejoyce on every
side.</hi> Such a Receiver is like to abide in Christ, and his
Word like to abide in him. He may be sure of his
Love, sure of his Friendship, sure of his favourable
Looks. For him Christ laid down his Life indeed;
and he may be confident that he is one of his little
Flock, for he hears his Voice, and is willing to be gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by him: For him the Saviour of the World hath
prepared a sure Refuge, <hi>a Munition of Rocks,</hi> where he
shall dwell securely, free from the stormy Wind and
Tempest. Such a Receiver believes in him, and he
shall not die: Nay, <hi>Though he were dead, yet shall he
live:</hi> Because Christ lives, he shall live too: And <hi>though
his Life be hid with Chrst, in God; yet when Christ, who
is his Life, shall appear, then shall he also appear with him
in Glory.</hi> His Faith shall at last be turned into Fruition,
his Hope into Vision, his Expectations into Enjoyment.
He shall see Christ at last in his Majesty: He shall see
him in his Wedding-Robes: He shall sit down with him
at last, at the Supper of the Lamb, and lean on his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som;
and the Angels will say, <hi>Behold, the Disciple whom
Jesus loved.</hi> He shall walk with him in shining Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
and the King's Daughter, which was all glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
within here, shall be all glorious without too:
Her Glory shall be the Joy of Saints, and the Envy of
all wicked Men. Such a Person rejoyced in his lig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

here, and he shall be decked with Eternal Light. He
that is the Light of both Worlds, shall be his Everlasting
Companion, and Darkness shall not annoy him. In a
Word, Christ will lift up the Light of his Countenance
upon him, and he shall be safe.</p>

               <p>O Great and admirable Saviour! who hast said, I will
give unto him that is a thirst, the Fountain of the
water of Life, freely; my Soul thirsteth for thee, my Flesh
longeth for thee in a a dry and thirsty Land. where no water
is, to see thy Power and thy Glory! I am unworthy to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
so Glorious a Guest into my Soul! I am unworthy to wash
the Feet of the Servants of my Lord! Unworthy of the least
Crum that falls from thy Table! The Angels, purer than the
Sun, think themselves unworthy to Praise and Glorifie thee;
How unworthy then must I think my self to receive thee, the
sweetest, and the brightest Being, into my House! yet thou offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
to come, and make thy abode with me. What Bounty is
this! Whence is it, that the Sovereign King of Heaven and
Earth will come and dwell in me, who am a sink of Misery,
a stye of uncleanness, a den of filthiness! How unworthy am
I of this astonishing Saviour! I freely confess, that I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
to be plunged into the depth of Hell, rather than to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
thee, the Glory of Heaven and Earth, into a Heart so
defiled, so polluted, so corrupted with Sin and Misery! Yet,
since thou dost freely offer me this unspeakable Mercy, Come,
Lord, and make thy Residence in my Soul. I desire to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
thee with all Love, and Purity, and Devotion! To this
end, destroy in me all that is contrary to thee, and enrich my
Soul with all suitable dispositions to receive thee! I hate my
Sins, I renounce them, I desire to think of them with horror,
because they were the cause of thy Torments, and of that death
thou sufferedst on the Cross; I would hate them, as the Angels,
and the Saints of Heaven do. I am sensible, thou art wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of all Honour and Glory, and from my Heart wish, that
I never had offended and dishonoured thee! O that I had some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of that Sorrow I see in thy Soul, when thou madest thy
Soul an offering for Sin! Thy Soul was exceeding sorrowful,
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:103387:178"/>
even unto death. It was my Sin that caused that Sorrow, O
let me participate of that Sorrow! O Jesu! my Light, my
Righteousness, my Sanctification, my Redemption! Open mine
Eyes, that I may see the vast Mercy, offered me in this Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Sacrament! Give me that Repentance, that Faith,
that Love, which may make me a worthy Receiver
of thy Benefits! I humble my self before thee, I throw my
self down at thy feet. I give my self to thee, I dedicate my
Thoughts, my Words, my Actions, my Understanding, my
Will, my Affections to thy Service! Set up thy Kingdom in
my Soul. Destroy my inordinate Self-Love, my Anger, my
Pride, and all my disorderly Inclinations. Let thy Humility,
thy Charity, thy Patience, and all thy Graces reign in me!
Where thou art, there is Heaven. If thou art in me, I shall
not fear what Man, or Devils can do against me; for thou
wilt hide me in the secret of thy Presence from the Pride of
Man, thou wilt keep me secretly, in a Pavilion, from the
strife of Tongues. Blessed be the Lord, who hath shewed us
his marvellous Kindness; I will sing of the Mercies of the
Lord for ever, with my Mouth will I make known thy faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
to all Generations. <hi>Amen, Amen.</hi>

threatning. A Question resolved, whether such. Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
if they befall an unworthy Receiver, do expiate his
Sins? God proved to be a consuming fire, and in what
sense. Though it be dangerous to Eat and Drink unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily,
yet this ought to be no discouragement from coming
to the Lord's Table. The Prayer.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>I. THE Apostle, <hi>1 Cor. 11. 29.</hi> in general, tells us,
<hi>He that Eats and Drinks unworthily, Eats and
Drinks Damnation to himself.</hi> A fearful word! The Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the Life of <hi>Ida de Nivella</hi> tells us, that whenever she
pass'd by the Altar, where the Eucharist used to be ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated,
a trembling seiz'd upon all her Joynts, a kind
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:103387:179"/>
of Ague fit came upon her, and a Sacred horror inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
her Soul, imitating the Earth in that particular;
which trembled at her receiving the Body of Him, who
fills Heaven and Earth with his Presence; but whether
it was so or no, I enquire not. At these words of the
Apostle, a serious Reader hath reason to tremble, and to
be afraid, and take care he comes not to this Table,
without a decent behaviour. And indeed, not a few
are so frighted by these words, that they think it safer
to abstain from this Sacrament, than to come to it, tho'
it is evident, that they might come, and yet prevent
that danger, if they were not more in love with their own,
than God's Will: What we render <hi>Damnation</hi> here, is
in the Original, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and we may justly question, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by this word is always meant, an everlasting sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
from the Glorious Presence of God, having our
Portion with Devils, feeling the <hi>treasures</hi> of God's ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
Wrath, and suffering the vengeance of Eternal
Fire. That the Word is used sometimes in Scripture in
this Sense, is evident from <hi>Joh. 9. 39.</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
where, though our <hi>Translation</hi> Reads,
<hi>For judgment am I come into the World,</hi> yet the Greek In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters,
<hi>Theophylact</hi> especially, interprets the expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
of <hi>Damnation,</hi> I am come into the World, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or <hi>Damnation.</hi> On the other side, it is
as certain, that by this word is very often understood
no more, than <hi>Judgment,</hi> and particularly some extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary,
signal, exemplary punishment, whether Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
or Corporal, inflicted in this present Life; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our Translators finding the word ambiguous, like
Men of Integrity, and Honesty, have put the word
<hi>Judgment</hi> in the Margent; and indeed the words, <hi>v. 30.</hi>
where the Apostle explains himself, and shews what he
means by <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, import so much, <hi>For this cause,</hi> saith he,
<hi>many are weak, and sickly among you, and many sleep,</hi> which
words cannot be conveniently applied to any other, but
some exemplary punishment in this World, inflicted on
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:103387:179"/>
the first Offenders, and Prophaners of this Ordinance.
However, since the Word is of that large extent, it's fit
we should consider it in both significations, as it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
both Temporal and Eternal Judgment, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
the reasonableness of the Commination; So that we
shall be obliged to speak, 1. Of Temporal Judgments
in general. 2. Of Bodily Sickness and Weakness. 3. Of
Spiritual Sickness and Weakness, or Sleepiness. And 4.
Of Damnation it self. All which are implied in this one
word, and are all just consequences, and very sad effects
of unworthy Eating, and Drinking in this Holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>II. I begin with Temporal Judgments in general,
which he that Eats and Drinks unworthily, Eats and
Drinks to himself. That <hi>Judas</hi> receiv'd this Sacrament
unworthily, none of those Divines, that believe he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
it at all, doth doubt; but see the vengeance that
attended him, he <hi>went</hi> and <hi>hang'd himself;</hi> and though
it is confess'd, that his Betraying of innocent Blood was
one cause of it, yet this unworthy Receiving may very
well be supposed to have been another. The Judgment
falling upon him, after Commission of both those
Crimes, both may justly be supposed to have been the
ingredients of it. The Guest that came to the Royal
Supper without a Wedding-Garment, went home with
Fetters on his Feet, <hi>Mat. 22. 12, 13.</hi> which was no
other than an Emblem of the Judgments, that those may
look for, that come defiled, and polluted with Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitence,
to this Table. It hath been observ'd by most
Historians, both <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Ecclesiastical,</hi> how God, as
patient as he is, for the most part, yet hath frequently
reveng'd the contempt of Sacred Things, by visible
Judgments. <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu,</hi> for offering strange Fire
unto the Lord, are suddenly consumed by Fire, <hi>Levit.
10. 2. Uzziah,</hi> for invading the Priests Office, is soon
after struck with a loathsome Leprosie, <hi>2 Chron. 26. 19.</hi>
and <hi>Josephus</hi> takes notice of one <hi>Theopompus,</hi> who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting
to take something out of the Bible, and to
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:103387:180"/>
mingle it with some profane Discourses of his own, ran
mad upon it, and continued so for Thirty days, till, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
himself to God by Prayer, he at last recover'd;
And he adds of one <hi>Theodectes</hi> a <hi>Poet,</hi> who having taken
some passages out of the Word of God, to embellish his
looser Verses, a sudden blindness seiz'd upon him; And
to go no further than our own Chronicles, <hi>William</hi> the
Conqueror destroy'd no less than 36 Mother Churches
in <hi>Hampshire,</hi> to make his New Forest; And besides all
this, takes away all their Plate, and Treasures, even
Chalices; Soon after, his Son <hi>Robert</hi> rebels against him,
his second Son <hi>Richard</hi> was kill'd in the New Forest, and
himself at last is thrown by his Horse, and dies upon't,
his Body for Three days lies neglected, and at last is bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
by a private Gentleman at <hi>Cane,</hi> where the Clergy
refused to bury him, till an agreement of Rent was made;
and in fine, his Bones are digg'd up again, and scatter'd
abroad. <hi>William Rufus</hi> afterward, who stor'd his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
by the sale of Church Chalices, and Jewels, was
accidentally, as the Story says, kill'd by Sir Walter <hi>Tyrrel,</hi>
the Arrow glancing from the Deer, and, by as signal a
Providence, dispatching him, as <hi>Ahab</hi> King of <hi>Israel</hi>
was kill'd by an Arrow shot out of a Bow, drawn at a
venture, <hi>1 King. 22. 34.</hi> The Heathens themselves have
observ'd a signal Vengeance, which hath waited on the
Profaners of Holy Things. And therefor <hi>Aelian</hi> makes
this remark upon <hi>Ochus Artaxerxes,</hi> that, having spoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and robb'd several Temples, he was in a short time
after miserably slain, and his Body thrown to Dogs and
Cats, and Vermin, and of his Shin-bones his Enemies
made Hilts, and Handles for Knives and Swords, and
other Instruments; and <hi>Lactantius</hi> mentions a passage
concerning the <hi>Potitii,</hi> a Noble Family, who having
been notoriously guilty of profaning the Sacred Rites of
<hi>Hercules,</hi> Thirty of that Family died all in less than a
years time; And <hi>Appius,</hi> who was the encourager of
the Sacriledge, was struck blind; And <hi>Servius</hi> saith of
<hi>Glaucus,</hi> the Son of <hi>Sisyphus,</hi> that having derided and
mocked some Holy Rites, he was torn in pieces by his
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:103387:180"/>
Horses. If it be said, that these sad accidents were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
by the Devil, whom these Heathens worshipp'd,
and that these were only the effects of his Tyranny
over Mankind; yet from hence we may infer, that as
the Devil is the Ape of God, so from God he hath learnt
to punish the abuse and profanation, even of his own
worship. And if <hi>Lucifer</hi> cannot endure to see his own
Sacred Rites profaned, how shall we think, that God,
who is of infinite Holiness, will permit such abuses to be
committed in things, appertaining properly to him,
without some manifestation of his Vengeance. When
the <hi>French</hi> under <hi>Charles</hi> King of <hi>Sicily,</hi> had turn'd the
stately Church of <hi>St. Narcissus</hi> into a Stable, and the
Altars there serv'd for Mangers for their Horses; a new
sort of Flies was sent by an invisible Hand, which mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lested
them, and stung them into strange and painful
Distempers, and most of them perish'd miserably. And
as it is with other Sacred Things, so it is more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
with the most Sacred Thing of all, the Holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
of the Lord's Supper. Bishop <hi>Morton,</hi> upon
this account, tells us of one <hi>Booth</hi> in his time, a Scholar
in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> who being Popishly inclin'd, yet loth to
own it, would still receive the Sacrament in our Church;
and coming one day to the Lord's Table, he seem'd to
to take the Holy Bread with his Hands, and put it in his
Mouth, but by an easie craft, he thrust it into his Pocket;
and when the Devotion of the Chapel was ended, he
took the Bread he had hid, and threw it over the Col<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ledge
Wall. But see the pursuing Judgment of God,
soon after he threw himself over the Battlements of the
Chapel, broke his Neck, and so ended his life. <hi>St. Cyprian,</hi>
one of the greatest and most eminent Men in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Church, relates, that a Girl left by her Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
in time of Persecution,<note place="margin">Serm. 5. de Laps.</note> to shift for her self,
and taken up by her Nurse, was by that Nurse,
being timorous, and loth to lose her own, and the Child's
l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fe for being Christians, carried to the Heathen Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate,
and there made to Eat and Drink of the Bread
and Wine offered to Idols, and the Heathen Deities,
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:103387:181"/>
This Child afterward, her Mother returning, was
by her conducted to Church, and came to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Eucharist with the rest of the Congregation, for
in those days they gave the Eucharist to Children,
as well as to adult Persons, where <hi>St. Cyprian</hi> himself
was then officiating. The <hi>Deacon,</hi> as his custom was,
carrying the Holy Wine about, and coming to the
Child, offers her the Cup, but finds a strange a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
in her, to touch it with her Lips, for through
a Divine Instinct teaching her, that the Cup of the
Lord and the Cup of Devils were inconsistent, and
incompatible, she turn'd her Head away, shut up
her Mouth, press'd her Lips together, and refus'd it
with obstinacy. The <hi>Deacon,</hi> however, (how prudent
he was in doing so, I shall not dispute,) using some
force upon her, poured some drops of the <hi>Eucharistical
Wine</hi> into her Mouth; which she had no sooner receiv'd,
but she fell a vomiting, groan'd, and sigh'd, and as the
Father expresses it,<note place="margin">In corpore &amp; ore violato Eucharistia permanere non po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

in a Chest. and when one day
she went rudely to open the Chest, a
Fire flashing out of the Chest, did fright
her so, that she durst not come near it any more:
All which Examples make it evident, that he that
Eats and Drinks unworthily, Eats and Drinks, or may
Eat and Drink, some extraordinary Temporal Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to himself.</p>
            <p>III. It must be confess'd, that the expression of
Eating and Drinking Judgment, is not very smooth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and proper, yet there is great Truth in the <hi>Metaphor,</hi>
and how the unworthy Receiver Eats and Drinks Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to himself, will appear from the following par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="349" facs="tcp:103387:181"/>
1. By eating and drinking unworthily, he prepares
for some extraordinary Judgment; which Judgment he
takes, and grasps, and attracts, and pulls to himself, as
Men do Bread and Wine, or Beer, when they are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to eat and drink. The Apostle, <hi>Rom. 9. 22.</hi> speaks
of Vessels fitted for Destruction; they fitted themselves
for it by their Sins, as a Thief, by stealing and robbing
upon the High-way, fits himself for the Gallows; or as
an idle, lazy Servant, that neglects his Master's Business,
fits himself for his Master's Anger: So the unworthy
Receiver, by eating and drinking irreverently, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
regard to the Obligations the Sight of Christ's Love
and Death lays upon him, fits himself for Judgment,
makes himself ripe for God's Vengeance, lays the Wood
together, and erects the Pile; gathers Materials, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bustible
Stuff for the Fire, that will certainly burn him;
and though he doth not do it designedly, and the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
comes contrary to his Intention, yet as long as he
doth that, to which such Judgments are annexed, he fits
himself for Judgment, as much as he that will touch
Vipers, and handle Adders, or let a Snake creep about
in his Bosom, though he may intend no harm by it,
yet actually prepares and fits himself for Mischief. Eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Drinking imports some Desire after, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in the Victuals before us: So he that by unworthy
Receiving, prepares for Judgments, seems to delight in
Judgment threatned him, because he will needs do that
which will certainly end in some Judgment or other.</p>
            <p>2. The unworthy Receiver eats and drinks Judgment
to himself, by incorporating the Guilt of some extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Judgment with his Soul. Eating and Drinking
unworthily, at the same time he brings Guilt upon his
Soul, and appropriates the deserved Judgment to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;
and as the Sin sticks to him, so the Demerits of the
Judgment which is threatned to the Sin, sticks to him
too. He eats and drinks unworthily; and the Effect it
hath upon him, is, God's Indignation, which he swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:103387:182"/>
with the Food unworthily taken. God's Wrath
goes along with his Sin; and as he takes the one, so he
doth the other, into his Bowels. As Poyson and Death
go together, so unworthy Feeding at the Lord's Table,
and God's Anger go together; and they both mingle
with the Spirits of the unworthy Receiver, as the Fish,
at the same time that he swallows the Bait, swallows the
Hook too; and he hath that fastned in him, which will
be his Death. So that <hi>Job</hi>'s Expression is very suitable
to the Subject in hand, <hi>Job. 20. 23. When he is about to
fill his Belly, God shall cast the Fury of his Wrath upon him;
and shall rain it upon him while he is eating.</hi> To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
<hi>David</hi> saith of the <hi>Israelites</hi> in the Wilderness mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring,<note place="margin">Psal. 78. 30, 31.</note>
and speaking against God, <hi>While
their Meat was yet in their Mouths, the
Wrath of God came upon them.</hi> So it may be said of an
unworthy Communicant: While he is feeding at the
Table of the Lord, the Wrath of God breaks forth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him, becomes due to him, and is his Portion;
falls to his Lot, and he gets a Title to it. We read of
<hi>Henry</hi> VII. Emperor of the <hi>Romans,</hi> that he was poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son'd
in eating of the Sacramental Bread, given him by
a Monk. This, they say, was the Fate of Pope <hi>Victor</hi> II.
who died of poyson'd Wine presented to him, in the
<hi>Eucharistical Chalice,</hi> by his <hi>Sub-Deacon.</hi> And the same
is reported of an Archbishop of <hi>York;</hi> that he fell down
dead, and swelled, upon receiving the Sacramental
Cup, given him by a Priest that bore some Spleen and
Malice to him. These Men did, without a Metaphor,
eat and drink their Death: And though he that eats and
drinks unworthily, doth not just in the same manner
eat and drink Judgment to himself, yet the Fate that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
him doth very much resemble the Misfortunes of
the other; only here is the difference, that the other
had a wicked Priest to put Poyson in their Cup, but
the unworthy Receiver puts the Poyson in himself; and
what was said of the other, may very truly be applied to
him, <hi>Calix vitae, Calix mortis:</hi> The Cup of Life becomes
a Cup of Death and Misery to him. <hi>Thou hast made us,</hi>
               <pb n="351" facs="tcp:103387:182"/>
saith the <hi>Psalmist, drink the Wine of Astonishment,</hi> Psal.
60. 3. This he spoke of the afflicted and persecuted Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
of his Age; but it may be applied to the unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Receiver too. He drinks the holy Wine, 'tis true;
but it will prove Wine of Astonishment to him when
the Judgment of God lights upon his Head; it will asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
and terrifie him: And what is said, <hi>Psal. 69. 22.</hi> is
true of him; <hi>His Table becomes a Snare to him:</hi> The Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of the Lord, he frequents, he turns into a Snare to
his own Soul, while he involves his better part in the
Guilt and Demerit of signal, exemplary Judgments.</p>
            <p>IV. But all this seems to be a groundless Supposition;
for there is no doubt, but there are unworthy Receivers
at this Day, as well as formerly; yet we see no such
signal Judgments executed upon any of them: And
therefore, what St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, must be either confined
to the Times he lived in, or, if it extends to our Age,
it doth not look like Truth.</p>
            <p>1. God sends Judgments upon Men many times, and
for their unworthy Receiving the holy Sacrament too,
and they take no notice of it. When God sends Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
because he doth not at the same time signifie the
Crimes laid against Men, or doth not set a Mark upon
them to give notice for what Sin the Judgment comes,
neither the Sufferer, nor the Standers by, especially the
more careless sort, take any Cognisance of his Anger:
And the Reason why God doth not, at the same time that
he sends the Judgment, send a Messenger to tell the Sinner
what the Judgment is for, is, because he hath given him
Reason and Power to enquire and search into his Heart
and Ways; upon which Search he may satisfie himself,
and come to the Knowledge of himself. It hath been
a very old Custom for Men not to take notice of God's
Judgments, but to ascribe them to Second Causes, to
Fate, or Chance; whereby God's Design in them hath
been lost, and his Displeasure, signified in the Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
dis-regarded. God complains of it, <hi>Isa. 42. 25.
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:103387:183"/>
Therefore hath he poured upon him the Fury of his Anger,
and the Strength of the Battel; and it hath set him on fire
round about, yet he knew it not; and it burnt him, and he
laid it not to heart.</hi> And so we read, <hi>Hos. 7. 9. Strangers
have devoured his Strength, and he knows it not; yea, gray
Hairs are here and there upon him, yet he knows it not.</hi>
Where Men are inconsiderate, and observe not the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences
of God, and the Operations of his Hand, they
may easily fall into a Conceit, that he sends no signal
Judgment upon an unworthy Receiver, when he doth.
But let a Man enquire seriously into the Cause of his
present Misfortunes, and into the Reasons of the Misery
or Affliction he lies under, or if he will lay himself open
to a faithful and conscientious Minister of the Gospel,
he may, without any great difficulty, find, especially,
if he hath formerly been at the Table of the Lord, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
considering what he did, that God's Judgment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Account of his eating and drinking unworthily,
slumbers not. <hi>God speaks once, yea twice; yet Man per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
it not,</hi> said <hi>Elihu,</hi> one of the Eastern Princes, and
<hi>J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>b</hi>'s Friends, <hi>Job 33. 14.</hi> It must needs be so where
Men's Reason lies dormant, and is not active. But an
intelligent Observer will see, that these threatned Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are not so confined to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> but that
they reach a great way farther, even to Men we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
with; and that these Judgments are more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent,
than the generality of unbelieving People think
they are.</p>
            <p>2. If God doth not send always exemplary Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
upon unworthy Receivers, it is an Argument in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
of his Patience; but the Sinner is not thereby se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
from the Stroak, for that which doth not come to
day, may come to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>orrow; and besides, having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
the Blow by his unworthy Approaches to the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of the Lord, the Sword hangs over him by a very
slender Thread, and waits only for God's Summons, to
fall on the Offender's Head: And what if God exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
Patience for the present? Who knows how soon that
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:103387:183"/>
Patience will be tired, and turn into a tempestuous In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation?
The Sinner hath still reason to fear it; and
that which seems to be far off this Week, may the next
be upon his Back, and consume both Root and Branch
This is certain, '<hi>Tis a fearful thing to fall into the Hands of
the living God,</hi> Heb. 10. 31. And if the Sinner be once
fallen into the Hands of an angry God, though he may
spare him for a while, as he did the stubborn <hi>Pharaoh,</hi>
who had long before deserv'd to be destroyed, only
God by his Providence held him up, that he might
shew his Power in him; yet when-ever the Judgment
comes, the Dealy will but aggravate the Doom, and
change the intended Rods into deadly Scorpions. Had
it been executed presently upon unworthy Receiving,
it would have been gentle, and easier to be born; but
the Delay gives it Strength, and makes it sorer; and
when-ever it comes, it comes with greater Weight and
Fury.</p>
            <p>V. 'Tis very probable, that some will be so curious,
as to desire to know, whether, in case any Temporal
Judgments do fall upon an unworthy Receiver, they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piate
the Communicant's Crime; or whether they may
be called Satisfactions, which God accepts of, for the
Offence committed against his Majesty. To this, the
Answer is, as follows.</p>
            <p>1. That the Punishment inflicted by a Civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate,
atones for the Offence committed against the
Law; and that the Offence is <hi>ipso facto</hi> forgiven, when
the Offender suffers the Penalty, we cannot deny: And
to a Man that superficially reads the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> even
the Saints of those Ages will seem to have been of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
that with the removing of the Temporal Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the Sin, for which it was inflicted by God, was
at the same time removed too: As, <hi>Psal. 85<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1, 2. Lord,
thou hast been favourable unto thy Land; thou hast brought
back the Captivity of</hi> Jacob; <hi>thou hast forgiven the Iniquity
of the People; thou hast covered all their Sin.</hi> And <hi>Psal.
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:103387:184"/>
103. 3. Who forgiveth all thine Iniquities; who healeth all
thy Diseases.</hi> Which Places seem to import, that <hi>David</hi>
believed that the removing of the Judgment did, at the
same time, remove the Sin, and the Guilt of it: But still
we must suppose, that though Repentance is not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd,
yet it is included; and that they did not lay the
Stress of Pardon upon the Removal of the Judgment so
much, as upon the Repentance which was occasion'd by
the Judgment. And therefore, whatever those Places
may seem to import, considering that the Fathers of the
<hi>Old Testament did all eat the same spiritual Meat, and did
all drink the same spiritual Drink; for they drank of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Rock that followed them, and that Rock was Christ,</hi>
1 Cor. 10. 3, 4. we must conclude, that since, under
the <hi>New Testament,</hi> Expiation of Sin is not allowed of
without Repentance, the Fathers under the Law could
have no other Apprehensions of Expiation: And though
they mention the Removal of the Temporal Judgment,
as an External Sign of the Expiation of their Sin; yet
the Internal Mark of it, and the principal, was their
Repentance; and while they name the one, they do
not exclude the other. The <hi>Jews</hi> at this Day, lay the
Stress of Pardon upon the Removal of the Judgment,
whether they repent of the Sin that caused it, or not;
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ay, they go so far, as to make their Death an Expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for all their Sins: By which Rule, no <hi>Jew</hi> can be
damned. And this comes, in a great measure, from
their mis-understanding of that Passage, <hi>Isa. 22. 14. And
it was revealed in mine Ears by the Lord of Hosts; Surely,
this Iniquity shall not be purged from you till you die, saith
the Lord of Hosts.</hi> Which Words import no more than
this, That God, with the Death of those wicked Men,
will put an end to the Scandal they have given to others
by their Iniquities; and that by their Death, God will
purge the City, or the Land, from such Abominations;
but not that their Death shall be an Atonement for their
Sins. And therefore,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="355" facs="tcp:103387:184"/>
2. Nothing doth properly expiate Sin, but the Blood
of Christ; and as <hi>without shedding of Blood, there is no
Remission;</hi> so by the shedding of Christ's Blood, Men
are put in a Possibility of being pardon'd. But Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
is the Preparative for the Application of that
Blood. Till a Man repents, he hath no Title to that
Blood, or the Benefits of it: And though God may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
the Temporal Judgment, yet if it works no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
the Sin shall be produced against the Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
in the last Day. All Temporal Judgments, though
they speak God's Displeasure at Sin, yet they are inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
withal, for the Offender's Reformation. And to
this purpose <hi>Elihu</hi> speaks excellently well, <hi>Job 33. 19,
20, 27. He is chasten'd also with Pain upon his Bed, and
the Multitude of his Bones with strong Pain; so that his
Life abhors Bread, and his Soul, dainty Meat; his Flesh is
consumed away, that it cannot be seen; and his Bones that
were not seen, stick out. He looks upon Men; and if any
say, I have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>inned, and perverted that which was right, and
it profited me not; he will deliver his Soul from going to the
Pit, and his Life shall see the Light.</hi> And therefore, if
this Judgment which falls upon an unworthy Receiver,
instead of softening and melting his Heart, doth but
harden him; there the Judgment is so far from expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
his Offence, that it hastens and aggravates his Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
Condemnation; and this very Sin will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred
in Hell, and double his Shrieks and Agonies.
And this is rational to believe; for when God, by that
Temporal Judgment, cannot reclaim him, the last Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
that God makes use of, to bring him to a better
Mind, is lost, his Folly is incorrigible; and as that
Judgment was a Talent he should have improved into
Repentance, so dis-regarding it, and making no other
use of it, than <hi>Pharaoh</hi> of his Plagues, and becoming
more setled upon his Lees, he justifies God's Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
against him in the last Day; which, though they
seem <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>evere to the Sufferer, who is loth to feel the
pain, yet they are reasonable; and he whom Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:103387:185"/>
Judgments could not reclaim, must know at last, to
his Cost, there is no jesting with the Anger of an Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
Majesty.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The Preceding Considerations reduced to
farther Practice.</head>
               <p>I. THE Apostle is in the right, when he tells us,
<hi>Heb. 12. 29. Our God is a Consuming Fire.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
to the Tractable, and Docile, who consider his
Providences, and take notice of his Loving-kindness;
who see the Vanity and Uncertainty of the World, and
build their Nest among the Stars of Heaven; who are
sensible of the Danger of walking after the Flesh, and
deliberately chuse to walk after the Spirit; who run
away from <hi>Sodom,</hi> get themselves out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> will
not be infected by the Sins of the World, and earnestly
desire to be strengthen'd in the Inward Man, with all
Might: To such he is all Kindness, all Love, all Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
all Light, all Compassion, all Charity: as we see
in the <hi>Parable</hi> of the <hi>Prodigal,</hi> where the Father's Acts
towards the penitent Sinner are so full of Sweetness, so
full of Affection and Tenderness, that nothing can be
imagined more kind, or loving, or favourable. But
Men who undervalue the Methods of Salvation, will be
happy their own Way, make light of that which they
ought to prize above their Lives, are unconcern'd about
the Sins that cost the Eternal Son of God his Life; will
needs dream of God's Mercy, while they obstruct it by
their Ingratitude; and hope to enter into Heaven, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
their Neglect of purifying their Hearts and
Lives; nay, can come to this Sacrament, and will not
be divorced from those Sins, which here they profess an
unfeigned Sorrow for. Such Persons shall know, and
feel, that <hi>God is Jealous, and that the Lord revenges; that
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:103387:185"/>
the Lord revenges, and is furious; that the Lord will take
Vengeance of his Adversaries, and reserves Wrath for his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies,</hi>
Nah. 1. 2. He is, indeed, slow to Anger, and
doth not wllfully afflict the Children of Men; but Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in Impenitence wakens his Vengeance; and where
his Patience tempts them to greater Wantonness, there
is no dallying with their Errours. <hi>These things hast thou
done,</hi> saith God, <hi>and I kept silence, and thou thoughtest that
I was altogether such an one as thy self; but I will reprove
thee, and set them in order before thine Eyes,</hi> Psal. 50. 21.</p>
               <p>II. Because it is so dangerous to eat and drink unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily,
yet that ought not to discourage any Person from
eating and drinking in this Sacrament. Worthy Eating
and Drinking here, is not dangerous at all; so far from
being dangerous, that it is a Duty, and beneficial, and
a Key to the choicest Mercies. And if it were dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
why should it fright any Soul from coming? 'Tis
dangerous to go to Sea: Yet doth the Sea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

forbear his Voyage? 'Tis dangerous to climb a
Tree: Yet doth the Husband-man therefore let his bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Fruit drop down, without getting up to gather it?
'Tis dangerous to fight against a numerous Enemy: But
is the Soldier therefore dis-hearten'd from venturing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Battel? Danger helps us to look to our Steps;
and if there be Difficulty in an Attempt, it whets our
Courage, and makes us fall on with the greater Force
and Earnestness: So that if worthy Eating and Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
were dangerous, it were an Invitation to an inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous
Temper to apply himself to it: But in this there
is no Danger. What Danger can there be in Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance?
What Danger in doing the Will of God? What
Danger in performing our Duty? What Danger in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Endeavours to cleanse our selves, that <hi>we may be
pure, even as God is pure?</hi> What Danger in eating and
drinking with a Lively Faith in the Promises of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel?
What Danger in making the Love of God, and
the serious Contemplation of it, a Motive and Occasion
to grow in Grace? If there be any Danger, it is in the
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:103387:186"/>
                  <hi>Unworthy</hi> Eating and Drinking at this holy Table; and
in that, indeed, there is as much Danger as there is in
<hi>cutting our selves with Knives and Lances,</hi> or in running a
Sword into our Bowels: And who but a Mad-man will
do so? There is nothing so good, nothing so safe, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
so sound, nothing so innocent, but Men may cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
it by their evil Inclinations: So they may abuse
God's Name, and Day, and Word, and Ordinances,
and the Duty of Prayer, and the Ministry; and what
not? Unworthy Eating and Drinking, is a sinful Eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Drinking. Let Men separate the Sinfulness
from the Duty, let them pare away that poysonous
Rind, and there is no Danger; and you may eat and
drink at this Table with as little Danger, as you eat and
drink at home; there is no Danger here, but what you
make your selves: The Danger rises not from the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist,</hi>
but from your Hearts. That which makes it
dangerous, is, your Love to Forbidden Fruit while you
eat and drink here. This you harbour, this you che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish;
and that makes your feeding dangerous: But cast
out that old Leaven, and you may feed as peaceably, as
contentedly, as securely, as Children under their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
Wings, as People that sit under their own Vine,
and under their own Fig-tree.</p>

               <head>The PRAYER.</head>
               <p>O Jesu! whom I see coming toward me in this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
not with Balm, and Myrrhe. and Spices, hut
with that which is infinitely better, even with the Balsom of
thy Blood, to anoint me, to wash me, and to make me whole,
to make this blind Creature see, and this lame Man to walk,
this Dumb to speak, this Deaf to hear, and to dignifie this
Beggar, even me, the weakest in thy Flock, the poorest in thy
House, the meanest person in thy Spiritual Kingdom! What
shall I say of this Mercy? What can I think of it? Thou art
both the Giver, and the Gift; the Feeder, and the Food; the
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:103387:186"/>
Guest, and the Feast; the Offerer, and the Oblation: O deal
with me after thine infinite Goodness! I have deserved to be
left, to be forsaken, to be rejected, to be cast away from thy
Presence! But, O! let not this miserable Beggar go away
from thy Door without an Alms; scatter thy Bounty, and let
me gather it. The poorer I am, the greater Object I am of
thy Pity! I bring my Heart to thee to reform it; I come to
offer my Soul, to thee; be thou intreated to renew it by thy
Holy Spirit. Bring me to a more lively and nearer conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

mine own Spirit, but by Thine, which is the Spirit of my
Spirit, the Soul of my Soul, and the very Life of my Life.
Thou art my Sun, from whose Beams I must receive the
Light of Grace; Thou art my Fountain, from which I must
draw Living Water. Thou art the Root, from which I must
receive Sap of increase. Thou art my Head, from which I
must receive Life and Being. O! let me feel the force of
this Sacrament in my Soul, Power against Sin and Satan,
and ability to serve thee. Corroborate my Spirit, that I
may obtain Victory; put off the anxious Cares of the World,
and put on Joy, flowing from Remission and pardon of my
Sins. I am sensible, that Thy Table is the strength of my
Soul, the Sinews of my Mind, the Band of my Confidence,
my Health, my Light, and my Recovery. Being sprinkled
with thy Blood, I shall be able to turn to fight the Armies of
Aliens, the Armies of my Spiritual Enemies, and prevail
against them, and go on from Virtue to Virtue, till I shall
Hunger and Thirst no more in thy Everlasting Kingdom.

            <head type="sub">Of Bodily Sickness, Weakness, and untimely
Death, which is sometimes by way of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
inflicted on Unworthy Receivers of this
Blessed Sacrament.</head>
            <argument>
               <head>The CONTENTS.</head>
               <p>Sickness, and Weakness, and Death, are either Corporal, or
Spiritual. Some Reasons laid down, why God makes use
of Sickness, and Weakness of Body, to Chastize the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
Receiver. How a Person may know, whether the
Sickness and Weakness of Body, that is upon him, comes
upon him for his Unworthy Receiving. How Sickness
and Weakness of Body, and an untimely Death, can be
said to be inflicted for Unworthy Receiving, when we see,
that even the most worthy Receivers sicken and dye, and
sometimes suddenly, and before their time, and when it is
evident, that these are effects of Natural Causes. The time
of Adversity, a time of serious Consideration. The Soul
that loves the Lord Jesus in sincerity, hath no reason to
be troubled, when Sickness or Affliction comes, as if it came
for Unworthy Receiving. Worthy Receiving, the best
Preparative for Death. Those that neglect coming, have
reason to fear, that all the Miseries which befal them, come
upon them for their neglect. The Prayer.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>I. HAving told you in the foregoing Chapter, that
the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or <hi>Judgment,</hi> doth import
both Temporal Judgment, and Damnation, and shewn,
how the unworthy Receiver makes himself liable to exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:103387:187"/>
Temporal Judgments in general; it's fit I should,
in the next place, in imitation of <hi>St. Paul,</hi> speak of the
particular Temporal Judgments, the unworthy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municant
pulls upon himself, whereof one is Bodily
Sicckness, Weakness, and untimely Death; for thus we
read, <hi>1 Cor. 11. 30. For this cause, i.e.</hi> upon the account
of this unworthy Eating and Drinking, <hi>many are weak
and sickly among you, and many sleep;</hi> as if he had said,
This your unworthy Receiving brings Sickness, Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and a preternatural and unusual Sleep upon you:
This must needs be meant here, for ordinary Sleep, or
the usual Rest of the Body can be no punishment; and,
to tell you, that by <hi>Sleep</hi> in Scripture, is frequently un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
<hi>Death,</hi> or separation of the Soul from the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
or dissolution of this natural Life, were to tell you,
what all Men know, that have but look'd into the Bible;
nor can any be ignorant, that these Phrases are often
used in a Spiritual Sense for Spiritual Weakness, and
Sickness, and Death, which will oblige me to take both
significations into consideration. And that God did,
in the Primitive Ages of Christianity, inflict and visit
unworthy Communicants with weakness and sickness of
Body, and with an untimely Death sometimes, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
if they continued impenitent, thereby to put them
in mind of their Offences, and to exhort them to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment
of Life, all Interpreters agree; and the same
Temporal Judgments, an unworthy Receiver hath rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to fear, and look for at this day, insomuch, that if
many a Man's sickness and weakness of Body, and not
living out halfe his days, were throughly examin'd, and
look'd into, it would be found to proceed, in a great
measure, from this Cause, even his unworthy Receiving
of the Holy Symbols.</p>
            <p>II. If we enquire into the Reasons why God makes
use of Sickness and weakness of Body, to lash the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
Receiver in this Life, we must conclude, that,
considering how all Afflictions and Judgments of this
Life are curative, and intended to work a change in the
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:103387:188"/>
Offender for the better, the Reasons why God makes
use of Sickness, particularly, in punishing the unworthy
Receiver, are these following:</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Sickness weakens the Flesh,</hi> abates and lessens its vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent
desires, whereby it comes to pass, that the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
part gets from under the slavery it lay enthrall'd
in, while the Flesh prevail'd, and puts the Sinner upon
serious Thoughts; for now it gets leave to exercise its
Authority, which before was over-aw'd, and crush'd,
and oppress'd, by the usurping Tyrant, and thereby oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions
terror and consternation in the whole Man about
his unworthy Receiving. While the Flesh is predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
and bears Rule, Faith and Reason are mere pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners,
and whatever they suggest is not hearken'd to.
The Flesh still baffles their Arguments, and admits of
nothing, but what pleads in favour of its brutish Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite.
Sickness coming, and weakning the Flesh, and
rendring all the delights of the World insipid and unsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voury,
the Soul recovers her freedom, and is now at
liberty to think of her former Life, to survey the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of her past Practices, and, among other Errors, to
reflect upon her unworthy Receiving, to aggravate this
particular Offence, and thereby to incline the sinner's
Eyes and Hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t to penitential Tears, for now the Man
having no hurry of business, no noise of vain company,
no external Gayeties, no Musick of sensual Pleasures,
to call him away from minding the things that belong
to the happiness of his Soul, he is more at leisure to
ruminate upon what he hath been doing, and the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
of his Sin, <hi>viz.</hi> feeding irreverently at this Table,
and not discerning, that the Body of the Son of God
was offered to his Soul, and if any thing will melt or
turn him, this is very likely to effect it.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Sickness puts the unworthy Receiver in mind of Death;</hi>
for he that falls sick, knows not, but his Illness may end
in Death; and there are few Men, but are of this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
when once they take their Bed; fear, that they
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:103387:188"/>
shall or may dye, makes them seek out for proper Helps
and Remedies, send for <hi>Physicians,</hi> if they be able, and
sometimes for Divines too; think of making their Wills,
set their House in order, and, after all, leave nothing
untried, whereby they may prevent the stroak of Death;
Sickness being of that nature, and having this influence
on men, may therefore be suppos'd to put the unworthy
Receiver in mind of his Death; and as it puts him in
mind of Death, so if he have any sense of Religion left,
it minds him also of an approaching Judgment, and sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gests
to him, that, for ought he knows, he will shortly
be in another World, be summon'd to give an account
of his Life to God, and appear before the Judge of
Quick and Dead, even before <hi>Christ Jesus,</hi> the Son of
God; whose Death hath had no influence upon his Life,
whose Blood he hath trampled under foot, whose Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
he hath not much thought of, whose Love hath
made no great impression upon him, whose Charity
hath wrought in him no considerable tenderness to his
Neighbour, whose Presence in the Sacrament he hath
undervalued, and whose entreaties to become Wise unto
Salvation, and meek and humble, and serious and blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
he hath stopt his Ears against; and how little Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
he must expect of that Judge, whom to please, he
hath not been much concern'd. This Kindness Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
may be supposed to do to the unworthy Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicant,
<hi>viz.</hi> to put him in mind of his Death, and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
account, and the Judge, whose Body and Blood he
hath profan'd; and his anger and indignation against
such Profanation; and what can be supposed more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual
to promote Repentance, and Godly Sorrow,
and new Resolutions to awake from the Dead, that
Christ may give him Life? And therefore, God makes
use sometimes of Bodily Sickness to afflict the unworthy
Communicant, But where Death seizes on the unworthy
Commnicant, either before he can bethink himself, or
before a previous lingring Sickness hath melted and
wrought his Heart into a Spiritual Life, there the Man's
case is deplorable indeed; for to think, that God will
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:103387:189"/>
accept of his Death, as a Satisfaction for his Sin, and
save him however, is to make a new <hi>Divinity,</hi> and to
erect Principles, which the Scripture knows nothing of.
'Tis true, in some Cases, where God cuts off a young
Man in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Flower of his Age; a young Man, I mean,
whose Li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e hath been blameless, attended with holy
Fears, and a Conscientious Behaviour, at home and
abroad; his untimely Death may be said to be a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
Affliction for some accidental Miscarriages, and
single Inadvertencies, such as never swelled into an Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit,
or setled Approbation; by which Affliction he is
saved and freed from the greater Condemnation, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Apostle's Rule, <hi>1 Cor. 11. 32. But when
we are judged, i, e.</hi> with Temporal Judgments, such as
Sickness, Weakness, and Untimely Death, whereof he
had spoken, <hi>Vers. 30. we are chasten'd of the Lord, that
we should not be condemned with the World.</hi> In this Case,
<hi>i.e.</hi> in Accidental Miscarriages, God may be said to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
of the lesser, for the greater Judgment, upon his
Account, who died, and rose again, for those who hear
his Voice. But where the Sin is habitual, rooted in the
Heart, hath invaded the Complexion, and is allowed
of, and thought harmless, and void of Hurt; there an
Untimely Death is no Security against Condemnation,
no Shelter against the Wrath to come: How far it may
abate or qualifie the future Indignation, I am not able
to say; but it is no Deletory, no Fortisication, no Charm
against that Storm.</p>
            <p>III. But here a Difficulty will arise, How a Person
may know that the Sickness or Weakness of Body that
is upon him, comes upon him for his unworthy Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving?
To which, I answer;</p>
            <p>1. There is not a more ready Way to know it, than
by ransacking our Life; and particularly, our publick
Devotions. If, in our present Sickness, we find, upon
Examination, that when we came formerly to the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
of the Lord, we came without any sincere Intent,
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:103387:189"/>
Desire, or Resolution, to be wrought into Love and
Obedience to <hi>Christ Jesus,</hi> by the Sight of his Cross,
and Death, and Charity; that we came, and went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
unconcerned, unmoved, untouched, at this <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicamentum
Immortalitatis,</hi> this <hi>Physick

               </note> as St. <hi>Dennis</hi> calls it; or,
that we thought that the Blessings pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
to the Faithful, and to those who strive, and fight
the good Fight, would fall to our share, and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed
to us in this Ordinance, without a due Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and Endeavours to tread in our Master's Steps;
we may easily infer, that we were unworthy Receivers;
and that, among other Causes of our Sickness, this is
one, and the principal too; even our unworthy and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reverent
Feeding at the Lord's Table.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Is any sick among you? Let him send for the Elders of
the Church,</hi> saith St. <hi>James, Chap. 5. Vers. 14.</hi> In the
Primitive Church, the sick Person, especially he that
was doubtful of his Spiritual Condition, sent for Seven
Ministers or Presbyters of the Church, as so many Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians,
to consult about the State of his Soul; before
whom he faithfully spread his Case, giving them as can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did
an Account of himself as he could; and so left it to
them, to judge and give Sentence in his Cause. And
this also is a very rational Way to come to a satisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Knowledge, whether the present Sickness proceed
from unworthy Communicating, or not. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
he that falls sick after he hath been at the Lord's
Table, let him send for a faithful Guide and Director,
and impartially signifie and reveal to him the Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his Soul, what it hath been, and what it is; and
the Actions of his Life, the manner of his Worship in
publick and private, and how and which way he used
to address himself to God; what his Thoughts and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations
were, when he used to go to the Table of the
Lord; what he felt after Receiving; whether it left an
Awe upon his Spirit, a Fear desiring his own Soul;
what his Design was in Receiving, and how far he clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:103387:190"/>
with God: And a pious, judicious Divine may be
very helpful to the sick Person, to direct, instruct and
inform him, whether the Sickness be an Effect of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
Receiving, or not. And, lest any should cavil
here, and object, What matter is it whether a Man know
the Occasion of his Sickness, and what it was that brought
it upon him? I shall offer, by way of Answer, these few
Particulars:</p>
            <p>1. If there were nothing but Curiosity in the Case,
something might be said for a Man's being so inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.
In Natural Causes of Distempers, Men think no
Curiosity great enough; and if either we our selves, or
Children, or Relations, fall sick, common Curiosity
tempts us to ask the Physician, what he thinks the Cause
of our Illness is; nay, if the Cause be unknown, both
to our selves, and others, we have very often the Curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
to have the Body of a Friend, or Child, open'd, to
know the Cause. And why People should not be as cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
in Spiritual Things, as they are in Natural, I know
no Reason. The Providences of God, and his Designs,
in the various Accidents that befall us, certainly deserve
our Curiosity and Inquisitiveness, much more than things
of an inferior Nature. Nor is it impossible to find out
the particular Cause, why God sends such a Sickness
upon certain Persons, when himself hath declared in his
Word, in what Cases, and upon what Provocations he
will send it.</p>
            <p>2. If the Sickness be found to be a Consequence or
Effect of unworthy Receiving, this helps to strengthen
our Faith in the Promises and Threatnings of God;
and finding, that what the Apostle hath said so many
Hundred Years agone, comes to pass still, this is a very
strong Argument that he spake by the Spirit of God,
and a Motive to admire the Veracity of God, and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
to believe the other Promises and Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
of the Word of God. Nothing is a greater Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
of Faith, than Experience; and he that hath
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:103387:190"/>
seen the things the Scripture speaks, very frequently ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished,
hath enough to turn his Faith into a full
Assurance.</p>
            <p>3. If the unworthy Receiver knows that it is his Sin,
committed in the holy Sacrament, that hath brought the
present Sickness upon him; if after that, he recovers,
and escapes, it will be an Obligation upon him to come
to it with greater Circumspection; <hi>For he that hath suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
in the Flesh,</hi> saith St. <hi>Peter, hath ceased from Sin,</hi>
1 Pet. 4. 1. And therefore, having suffered for his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
Receiving, that Suffering will make him weary
of his Sin; which he cannot be, except he comes for
the future, and <hi>draws near with a pure Heart; holding fast
the Profession of the Faith, without wavering;</hi> as it is said,
<hi>Heb. 10. 22, 23.</hi> But,</p>
            <p>IV. While we are discoursing of this particular Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
another Doubt arises, <hi>viz.</hi> How Sickness of the
Body, and an untimely Death, can be said to be inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for unworthy Receiving, when we see even the most
worthy Receivers sicken, and grow weak, and die
young many times, in the Prime and Flower of their
Age: And nothing is more vulgarly known, than that
Sickness and Death are nothi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>g but the Product of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Causes? I answer;</p>
            <p>1. Though even very excellent Christians, who may
be supposed to have been very penitent and worthy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers,
ever since they frequented the Ordinances of
God with any Sense and Understanding; though even
such do sicken, and many times die suddenly, and in
the midst of their Race; yet that proceeds from other
Causes: And these Accidents are either Trials of their
Faith and Patience, or Preparatives for Heaven, or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servatives
from Sin, or Occasions to glorifie God, or
Opportunities to promote the Honour of Religion, or
Chastisements for some rash and imprudent Actions, to
prevent their being condemned with the World. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:103387:191"/>
to which Rule, we are to judge of the untimely
Death of that Prophet, <hi>1 Reg. 13. 24.</hi> who cried against
the Altar of <hi>Bethel:</hi> A good Man, no doubt; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
persuaded by the crafty old Prophet, who preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
a Counter-Inspiration, he went back, and ate Bread
in the place against which he was warned; for which
imprudent Act, a Lion found him, and slew him. And
such was the Death of <hi>Uzzah, 2 Sam. 6. 7.</hi> who, out of
a good intent, put forth his Hand to uphold the Ark,
that was in danger of falling, the Oxen that drew the
Cart, shaking it: For which, God struck him dead up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the place. And this was the Case of <hi>Josiah,</hi> a Man
noted for his singular Piety; yet going up rashly against
<hi>Pharaoh Necho,</hi> was killed in Battel, though, according
to the Course of Nature, he might have lived many
Years longer. Thus God chastised the impremeditated
Errours of his Servants in this Life, that they might not
fall a Prey to the greater Condemnation hereafter. One
and the same Effect, may have very different Causes;
and the Reasons of Things that happen in the World,
are various. The same thing may be a Mercy to one,
which is a Judgment to another; as the <hi>Pillar of a Cloud,</hi>
Exod. 14. 19, 20. was Darkness to the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and
Light to the <hi>Israelites:</hi> And the Meat sent to <hi>Elijah,</hi> was
a Character of God's Love; whereas that sent to the <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites,</hi>
upon their murmuring, was a Fore-runner of
his Wrath and Anger. And this may be applied to
Sickness, and Untimely Death: In the unworthy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver,
it is a Punishment; in the Worthy, a singular
Mercy. A Prince may send two Persons, one whom
he hates, another whom he loves, to Prison, with very
different Intents; the one, with an Intent to have him
executed according to Law; the other, to preserve him
from the Rage of his Enemies: And the same may be
said of Sickness, which, we see, lights indifferently, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Good and Bad.</p>
            <p>2. Though Sicknesses, and Untimely Death, are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd
by Second Causes; by Colds, and Heats; by
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:103387:191"/>
hard Labour, and Straining; by excessive Passion, and
Grief, and Joy; by tedious Journeys, and dangerous
Voyages; by Fevers in the Blood, and Contrariety of
pugnant Humours; by Winds, and Storms; by Fire,
and Water; by a Pestilential Breath, and going to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
Places, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet he that sits at the Stern of the
great Vessel, must not be supposed to look on carelesly,
or to be nothing but a Spectator of the Conspiration of
the Second Causes. These Second Causes are constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
govern'd by a Power supream; and by his Order
and Influence they move. He directs, and bids them
concur to produce such Effects; and while they seem
to act by Chance, and in the dark, he himself hath
pregnant Reasons, why he causes such a Concourse of
inferior Causes; and these Reasons he hath thought fit
to reveal in his Word, where we are to seek them. So
that though an unworthy Receiver may get his Sickness
and Death by Quarrelling, by Gluttony, by Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Intemperance, by being wounded and bruised
by rude and insolent Men, yet Providence is not asleep
all this while; and though he doth not command or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
the Sins which are the Occasion, or the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
Causes of the ensuing Sickness, yet he wisely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
them, resolves not to hinder them from producing
such Effects, for Reasons his Eternal and infinite Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
hath pitched upon; so that they may very well be
intended as Punishments and Judgments, even while
they are the natural Effects of Second Causes: And
God, in punishing the unworthy Receiver with Sickness,
and untimely Death, <hi>lays Righteousness to the Line, and
Justice to the Plummet;</hi> there being nothing more just,
than that he should fall sick, that hath been sick of God's
Service; and he come to an untimely Death, that hath
disregarded the Death of <hi>Christ Jesus,</hi> and counted it
an unworthy thing. And what if some unworthy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers
live as long as other Men, and perhaps to a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
great Age; yet that doth not make the Apostle's
Words less true; nor is it any Security to the Offenders,
that therefore they shall go scot-free. The Threatnings
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:103387:192"/>
of God that concern this present Life, if they are not
executed in this Life, shew however what the Sinner
hath deserved; and not being executed here, if that
which should have been inflicted here, is added to the
Punishment hereafter, he hath no great reason to brag
of his escaping here. Sometimes the Sinner bethinks
himself, and repents, and turns from his Errour, and
by that means escapes the sad Effects of his Threatning;
for all Threatnings have this implicite Condition inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
<hi>In case the Offender doth not make his Peace with God.</hi>
Add to all this, That if the Threatnings of God be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
upon some Persons, guilty of the Sin to which
the Threatning is made, it is enough to vindicate the
Veracity of God: And if any Sinner, of the same Size
and Degree, do escape, still the Threatning shews what
they may expect, if they turn not.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The Preceding Considerations reduced to Practice.</head>
               <p>I. THE Wise Man's Advice, surely, is very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonahle,
<hi>Eccles. 7. 14. In the Day of Adversity,
consider.</hi> Times of Affliction are considering Times.
Affliction is sent on purpose to teach, and to instruct
us: 'Tis intended to put us in mind of the Sins we have
forgotten, or been wilfully ignorant of; the Sins of our
Childhood, the Sins of our Youth, the Sins of our ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Age, and the various Neglects and Defects of our
holy Services. And therefore, in the <hi>Old Testament,</hi>
the Word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Jasar,</hi> which stands for Affliction, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
not only Correction and Chastisement, but In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
too: It is an excellent School-master; and he
that submits to its Teachings, will become wiser than a
Multitude of Books will make him. <hi>Therefore, my Son,
despise not thou the chastening of the Lord; nor faint when
thou art rebuked of him,</hi> Heb. 12. 5. Consider who it is
that sends the Rod, and what the Design of the unwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
Messenger is. Consider how much thou needest
it, and how justly thou hast deserved it. Consider how
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:103387:192"/>
it is intended for thy Good; and how thou shouldest
have forgotten why thou camest into the World, but
for this Remembrancer. Consider how little Reason
thou hast to take it ill, when the dearest Servants of
God have passed through this Fire; and how, without
it, thou wouldst have continued a Stranger to thy self.
Consider its Mercy, that he will call home the straying
Sheep, and will not let thee wander in the Wilderness
of Sin: And that when he strikes, his Intent only is to
beat the Dust out of thy Clothes, not to hurt the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
part. This Consideration will go near to produce
that excellent Temper in thee, which <hi>David</hi> speaks of;
<hi>Surely, I have behaved and quieted my self, as a Child that is
weaned of his Mother: My Soul is even as a weaned Child,</hi>
Psal. 131. 2.</p>
               <p>II. Let not him that is weak in Faith, yet loves the
Lord <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> in Sincerity, makes Conscience of his
Laws, and would not willingly offend him, to gain the
World; let him not be frighted when Sickness, or any
outward Disaster and sad Accident befals him, as if that
were a certain Argument, that therefore he hath received
unworthily. The Enemy may suggest such a Thought;
but, <hi>Christian,</hi> explode it as boldly as it comes. They
are other Reasons that make thy Heavenly Father lay
his chastening Hand upon thee. His Design is, to make
thee entirely conformable to his own Son; to that Son,
who, <hi>for the Glory set before him, endured the Cross.</hi> He
was made perfect through Suffering; so would God
make thee perfect through Affliction. If a Person be
never so holy, yet if he hath not passed through the
Furnace of Affliction, he wants Perfection. Afflictions
gave the Son of God, as he was Man, a Title to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
Kingdom; and they are <hi>Items</hi> to thee, that thou
shalt reign with <hi>Christ</hi> for ever. These Troubles that
encompass thee, are to make thy future Joys the greater,
and thy Crown more bright and shining. Fear not that
thou hast received unworthily, while thy Conscience
bears witness that thine Eyes, thy Heart, thy Affections,
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:103387:193"/>
were toward him in the holy Sacrament, and are so
still: If thy Treasure and thy Heart was in Heaven then,
and thou still endeavourest to preserve that Frame, thy
Eating and Drinking hath done thee good, and thou
hast been refreshed by it, and <hi>the Lines did fall to thee in
pleasant places.</hi> These present Afflictions are thy Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
that God loves thee; and as they tell thee that thou
hast no continuing City here, so they help to prepare
thy Soul for the Possession of that Inheritance which
shall last for ever.</p>
               <p>III. Worthy Receiving of the Lord's Supper, is the
best Preparative for Death. No Man can die uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably,
that makes it his Business, as often as he comes
to this Table, to receive worthily. Death cannot hurt
him, let it be natural or violent, untimely or orderly;
for, by this worthy Receiving, he hath laid up a good
Foundation against the Time to come Death may destroy
his Body, but cannot kill the Soul. Death may fright
him, but it cannot undo him. It may dis-lodge his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
but it drives it to a nobler Habitation. It may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
the Guest, but it gives him a Title to a better Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.
His worthy Receiving gives him an Interest in
Christ's Death; and because Christ lives, he shall live
also. Death may come blustering, and make a Noise;
but in that Whirlwind his Soul rides to Heaven. Let
his Death come by Sword, or Famine, or Torment, or
Fire, or Water, it makes no Alteration in his Happiness.
<hi>To him, to live, is Christ; and die, Gain:</hi> And he knows
who hath said, <hi>I am the Resurrection, and the Life.</hi> The
worthy Receiver never dies, for he lives in Christ, who
abides for ever. Christ will not suffer that Soul to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish,
in which he hath been pleased to make his Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
He is concern'd to secure her Happiness; and his
Eyes are open upon her, to do her good. Her worthy
Receiving arms her against the Fears of Death, and scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
the Mists which Death doth cast before her Eyes.
Receiving worthily, makes the Soul a sit Habitation for
the Spirit of God; and <hi>If the Spirit of him that raised up
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:103387:193"/>
Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ
from the dead shall also quicken your mortal Bodies by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
that dwells in you,</hi> Rom. 8. 11.</p>
               <p>IV. As the unworthy Receiver, when Sickness, or
some other heavy Judgment, lights upon him, hath rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to believe, that it is for his unworthy Receiving; so
he that wilfully neglects coming to this holy Sacrament,
may very justly conclude, that all the Troubles and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series
that befall him, do, in a great measure, befall him
for that Neglect. 'Tis hard to determine which is the
greater Sin, whether Receiving unworthily, or not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
at all; both will admit of great Aggravations:
And as these Sins are in a manner equal, so it is not ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rational
to conclude, that the Judgments threatned to
the one, may be inflicted for the other too. As the <hi>Jews</hi>
say of the <hi>Golden Calf,</hi> that an Ounce of that Sin is an
Ingredient into all the Calamities that came upon them;
so there is not a Cross that the wilful Neglecter of this
Sacrament feels, or endures, but he hath reason to think
that this Neglect contributes towards it; and all his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series
call to him, though he will not hear the Voice,
not to neglect so great Salvation; and if all these Calls
cannot awaken him into a Sense of his Duty, how must
his Reckoning swell, and how inexcusable must he be,
whom neither the still Voice of Prosperity, nor the shril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
Sound of Adversity, can convince? <hi>Take, eat, this is
my Body;</hi> and <hi>Drink ye all of this,</hi> is a Duty, as much as
<hi>doing by others the same that we would have others to do us.</hi>
It will appear, and be made out one Day, that this was
not an Evangelical Counsel only, which the more Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Sort, that are ambitious of the highest Place in
Heaven, need only mind, if they please. It was said to
all the Disciples, that represented the Church-Militant:
And if thou professest thy self a Member of that Church,
thou art no more excused from the Performance of it, than
thou art from coming to Church, and attending the other
Ordinances of God. But if these Motives cannot prevail,
God hath Enforcives which shall; but from these, <hi>Good
Lord deliver us.</hi>

               <p>O God! When thou with Rebukes dost chasten Man for
Iniquity, thou makest his Beauty to consume away like
a Moth! Hear my Prayer, O Lord, and give ear unto my
Cry; hold not thy Peace at my Tears. Oh, let the Afflictions
which have befallen me, and which thou shalt hereafter think
fit to send upon me, help towards the strengthening of my
Faith in Christ Jesus. Thou hast sometimes laid thy Hand
upon me, thy Afflicting Hand, and I have taken no notice of
it. Thou hast smitten me, and I have not looked up to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
from whence the Stroak did come. Thou hast corrected
me, and I have not been the better for it. I have been like
a Beast before thee; so foolish was I, and ignorant. Oh,
teach thou me! Let me read my Duty in my Crosses. And
whatever Trouble comes upon me, let that Trouble direct me
to the Cross of my dear Master, the Lord Jesus. Enlarge my
Contemplations of the Cross of Christ, by the Crosses that knock
at my Door. Let these make me more zealous to participate
of the Benefits of the Cross of Christ. In these Crosses and
Troubles, let me find Motives to come with greater Serious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to the Table of my crucified Redeemer. Let these prompt
me to run to the Tree which yields the Fruit of Righteousness.
Let not these discourage me from loving thee; but rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame
my Affections, to make thee my Hope and Fortress, my
Light, and my Salvation. Let me look upon the Joy that all
my Troubles will at last end in, and take Comfort in all my
Tribulations. Imprint this Belief upon my Soul, that thou
knowest better what is good for me, than my Carnal Heart.
I am apt to hanker after the <hi>Flesh-pots</hi> of <hi>Egypt;</hi> but let
me see the richer Table in thy Kingdom. I am apt to be fond
of these outward Comforts: Oh, quench my Thrist after them!
Let me see clearly, that to feed on thy Love, is better Diet
than this Earth affords. Give me thy Peace; not as the World
gives, but as thou usest to give thine own People. Oh! give
me what I want: Thou knowest my Necessities better than I.

The Signs of Spiritual Weakness, Sickness and Death.
God inflicts these Spiritual Judgments upon Unworthy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers
by degrees. The Justice of it vindicated, in four
Particulars. Spiritual Weakness and Sickness, proved to
be a greater Judgment than the Corporal. Of the End of
our Eating and Drinking worthily at this Table, which is
Spiritual Health; and wherein that consists. Spiritual
Judgments more common than Men think or suspect. Our
Souls are capable of Diseases, as well as our Bodies. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral

            </argument>
            <p>I. AS Corporal, so even Spiritual Weakness, Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and Death, proves too frequently an Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of Eating and Drinking unworthily at this Table:
Nay, these Spiritual Sicknesses are more common than
the other. 'Tis true, they cause no Pain, no Aches, no
Torments in the Bowels; they are not felt, as the Pleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risie,
or Cholick, or Twisting of the Guts; but they
are Sicknesses still: And because we find such Things,
and God manifests his Anger often against unworthy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving,
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:103387:195"/>
by such Symptoms we have reason to believe,
the Apostle aimed at these, as well as at Bodily Diseases,
when he avers, <hi>For this Cause many are weak and sickly
among you, and many sleep.</hi> 'Tis true, there is not a more
proper Medicine for all the Diseases of the Soul, than
this holy Sacrament. To which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,<note place="margin">De Sacram. Dist. 3.</note>

               <hi>If in the Eucharist, in the Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of our Saviour's Passion, we reflect on his Humility, it
will free us from the Infection of Pride. If we think of his
wonderful Charity, we shall be delivered from the Evil of
Envy. If we consider with what Alacrity he went to die for
us, and to offer himself in Sacrifice for us, it will be an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidote
against Weariness of his Service, and Backwardness to
Devotion. If we ponder his Bounty, and how liberally he gives
us himself, and all he hath, we shall be rid of Covetousness.
If we lay his Meekness and Patience to heart, it will be an
excellent Remedy against Wrath and Anger. If we remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
how frugal his Supper was, and how far from Pomp and
Ostentation, and how mean the Food was he made use of, it
will check our Gluttony and Voracity. And if we cast our
Eyes on the bitter Herbs he eat, the Emblem of his bitter Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
we shall not be troubled much with Luxury.</hi> And to
this purpose was the Saying of <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent</hi>
III.<note place="margin">De Myster. Miss. l. 4. c. 44.</note> That <hi>the Mystery of the Cross
frees us from the reigning Power of Sin;
and the Mystery of the Eucharist, from a Desire of Sin.</hi> And
if the Woman in the <hi>Gospel</hi> was cured of her Infirmity
by touching but the Hem of <hi>Christ</hi>'s Garment, what
Virtue may we suppose in his whole Body, if it be
touched by a lively Faith in this Ordinance! If God
hath given to the Fat of Vipers Virtue to expel Poyson,
shall not we think there is greater Virtue in <hi>Christ</hi>'s cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified
Body, to cure the Diseases of the Soul? If he
gave Virtue to the Tree of Life in <hi>Paradise,</hi> to prolong
Age, and to procure Perpetuity of Duration; shall not
<hi>Christ</hi>'s Flesh, represented by the Symbols here, confer
Life, and Health, and Salvation much more? If he
have given some Minerals Virtue to disperse Fumes and
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:103387:195"/>
Vapours; shall not we believe there is greater Virtue in
the Incarnate Son of God, to disperse the Clouds and
Fogs that molest and annoy the Soul? This cannot be
denied; and we may rationally believe, that this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
is intended by God to cure all the Distempers
of the Soul: But if that Medicine be not used as it
ought, the Soul, instead of growing stronger, becomes
more weakly, more sickly, and draws nigh unto the
Gates of Death.</p>
            <p>II. What this Spiritual Weakness, Sickness and Death,
is, will not be very difficult to discover. If you mind
the <hi>Apostle</hi>'s Expression, there is a Gradation in the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
he speaks of; <hi>Weakness</hi> is a lower Degree of Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
than <hi>Sickness,</hi> and <hi>Sickness</hi> a lower Degree than <hi>Death.</hi>
The first Act of God's Displeasure against Receiving un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily
is, to inflict Weakness; if that works no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
then Sickness; and if this doth not make
the Sinner rise, then Spiritual Death.</p>
            <p>1. Spiritual Weakness. And this may be said to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
in these following Particulars:</p>
            <p>1. <hi>In the Loss of Lively Apprehensions of Spiritual Things,
which were formerly vouchsafed to the unworthy Receiver.</hi>
Even Men that are Hypocrites in Religion, and whose
Hearts were never throughly changed, have sometimes
Flashes of Heaven or Hell, coming either from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
or from within. <hi>Ahab</hi> certainly had a very great
Sense of God's Displeasure, and a Sight of Divine Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
surprized his Mind, when <hi>he rent his Clothes, and
put Sack-cloth upon his Flesh, and fasted, and lay in Sack-cloth,
and went softly,</hi> 1 King. 21. 27. And some of us
may have known some Persons, who have been given
to Drinking, or Swearing, or Lying, or Uncleanness,
or Quarrelling; when their Office, or Employment,
or Station in the World, or some such External Cause
and Motive, have put them upon Receiving the Holy
Sacrament; before they have come to this Table, they
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:103387:196"/>
have had some very serious Thoughts, and you might
observe in them a Demureness of Behaviour, some Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions
of the Necessity of Repentance; and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
their Hearts have been so touched, that even a
few Tears have dropped from their Eyes, as a Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of their being moved at the Thoughts of <hi>Christ</hi>'s
Death and Passion; but the Sacrament being over,
their Devotion hath been at an end too, and they have
returned to their old Sins; which made them unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Receivers, because this shews, they were not hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
resolved, when they came to this Table, to subdue
their Corruptions. Their lively Apprehensions of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Things, they formerly had, have thereupon grown
dark and decayed, become languid and faint, and no
Foot-step of them hath been left. Those Flashes of
good Thoughts, though short and transitory, had they
been improved, would have signally strengthen'd their
Souls, and encouraged their practical Love to <hi>Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus:</hi>
But being careless and regardless of that Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
God justly lets those lively Apprehensions decay;
and thence comes their Spiritual Weakness. God could
uphold those lively Apprehensions; but they having no
Love to them, God, by a secret Judgment, lets them
wear out: And then, What can be the Issue, but Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Weakness?</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Irresoluteness to resist Temptations, is another Symptom
of this Spiritual Weakness.</hi> When the Soul is either un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resolved,
whether it shall resist such known Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
or not, or resist them but faintly; it is a Sign the
Powers of the Soul are shaken, and the Plague is begun
in the Heart. By Temptations, I mean, such Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
as are agreeable to our sinful Temper and Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
or such as our Calling and Employment makes us
subject to. He that observes, and takes a View of such
Sinners as Receive unworthily, cannot but spy in them
a very feeble and irresolute Resistance of such Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
For, notwithstanding whatever Resolutions they
made before Receiving; whatever Prayers and Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:103387:196"/>
for God's Grace and Assistance, they offered,
and put up before; yet, after they have been at this
Table, the old Temptations return, even the same dear
Friends that enticed and persuaded them to sin before;
their Resistance is very weak, and they know not well
what they shall do, whether they shall displease their
own, and other Men's vain Desires, or no. Perhaps some
little horror, or kind of damp, the Sacrament for the
present leaves upon their Minds, hath so much force up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them, that they make some attempts, and use some
trifling endeavours to resist; but as this resistance is not
an effect of an active Faith, but only of slavish fear, so
it doth not preserve them untainted, and undaunted,
in the hour of Temptation, which is an Argument, both
of Spiritual Weakness, and God's Judgment, because
<hi>they did not like to retain God in their knowledge,</hi> as <hi>St. Paul</hi>
speaks, <hi>Rom. 28.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Spiritual Sickness, the signs of which are as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Want of relishing the Things of God, and the Mysteries
of Religion.</hi> By this, we conclude, that a Man is sick in
his Body, if the Bread, or Wine, or Apples, or Meat he
swallows, seem to him Food or Drink, different from
what they appear to sound and healthy; and, by the
same Argument we may infer, that a Man's Soul is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
sick, when the Promises, Precepts, Commands, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
Privileges, and Immunities, of the Gospel, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sipid
and unsavoury to him, and his Soul finds no sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
no agreeableness, no juice, no life, no pleasantness
no delight, no pungency in them. If these appear to
her as common things, and affect her no more than what
the <hi>Great Mogol</hi> doth in the <hi>Indies,</hi> or what Men talk
on the Coast of <hi>Guinea.</hi> If they raise no wonder, no
admiration, no affection, no appetite, no strong desire
in her; if she can hear them, read of them, survey them,
think of them, without being touch'd with the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
and importance of them, the Soul is infallibly
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:103387:197"/>
under some great distemper, and the whole Head is
sick, the whole Heart is sick, grievously sick, and the
wound is dangerous; and that this Spiritual sickness dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers
it self too often in unworthy Receivers, we need
no other proof, but what their known aversion gives us;
I mean, their aversion from good Thoughts and Discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fes,
after they have been at the Table of the Lord. Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Word, digesting it, and endeavouring to see
wondrous things in that Law, and meditating of some
part of it day and night, is irksome to them, tedious:
and when something savouring of Heaven and Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is propos'd to them, they stand upon Thorns all the
while, nor can the goodness of God prevail with them,
to deny themselves in any thing they have a mind or
strong inclination to, a certain sign of their being sick,
and of God's Judgment upon their Souls.</p>
            <p>2. Another symptom of this Spiritual sickness, is <hi>When
a known Sin becomes habitual, and the few single Acts pass
into temper, and come to be incorporated with nature, and
turn into constitution and complexion.</hi> In this case, the
Soul may be judged very sick, as sick as the Body that is
troubled with the Stone or Gout, and where the distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
or Morbific Matter, is so dispers'd through the
Mass of Blood and Joynts, that tho' it admits of respite,
and lucid intervals, sometimes; yet, as the Humours
that feed it, gather strength again, so the Distemper re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns.
And this sickness doth evidently discover it self
in unworthy Receivers, who were formerly but <hi>Punies</hi>
and <hi>Novices</hi> in certain sins; but, after their unworthy
Receiving, harden themselves in the practice of them,
commence Graduates, and drink them in, as the Ox
doth the Water; and they become their Darlings, their
<hi>Benjamins,</hi> as dear to them as their Right Eye, as dear
as their Foot or Hand, than which there cannot be a
surer sign of their being spiritually sick, and lying under
the weight of a spiritual Judgment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="381" facs="tcp:103387:197"/>
3. Spiritual Death: And this also is to be known by
symptoms, which are these;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1. When the Conscience smites no more:</hi> When it gives
over striving with the Sinner, he is dead, as that Body,
in which the Pulse hath left off beating. So it was with
the <hi>Prodigal,</hi> of whom <hi>Christ</hi> expresly saith, Though his
natural life was sound and whole, <hi>that he was dead.</hi> No
remorse, no regret, appear'd in his Soul. All was still,
as in a Charnel-House, no noise within to fright him.
All was turn'd into the silence of the Grave. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted
in his nastiness, in his Mud, and Dung, and
Filth, and Swinish Desires, nothing prick'd him, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
stung his Heart. And that this Death is to be
found in some unworthy Receivers, is manifest from
their Actions, for they become stupid in their Errors,
and having baf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>led their Conscience, laid that inward
witness to sleep, and hush'd it into a fatal slumber; It
stirs not, it moves not, and they know not when they
sin, and when they do not. To that insensibleness they
bring themselves, that when God calls, they <hi>cannot see
with their Eyes, nor hear with their Ears, nor understand
with their Hearts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Another Symptom of this Spiritual Death is, <hi>When
the Sinner begins to look upon Religion, either as a trick of
Divines, or Politicians, or a needless thing.</hi> This excludes
all sense of another world, the only thing whereby the
Soul lives, and therefore that being gone, the Soul is
dead, and that he, who <hi>hath the power of Death,</hi> even
the <hi>Devil,</hi> hath killed and mortified all the good Seed
that lay scattered in his Breast. Indeed, this is such a
degree of Death, which unworthy Receivers do not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ordinarily arrive to, yet sometimes they fall, even in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
this Gulph; for what should hinder them from tumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
down so low, that have lost their hold in a Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
Saviour, from whose Arms they have broke loose,
unwilling that he should have any thing to do with them,
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:103387:198"/>
but just to save them, if he pleases? The Bands of Love
and Obedience, are the only things that preserve the
Soul from Death; and the unworthy Communicant ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
made a shift to throw those Cords from him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
loth to be tied and held by them, he sinks into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of these things, and, from thence, into scorning
of Religion it self. In all which, the Judgment of God
is clearly to be seen; for though God doth not call by
an audible Voice from Heaven, that it is so, nor set a
mark upon the unworthy Receiver, as he did on <hi>Cain,</hi>
whereby spectators may know, that this is a sign of the
Divine Judgment upon him; yet it's enough, that we
are told in the Word of God, <hi>Woe to them, when I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
from them,</hi> Hos. 9. 11.</p>
            <p>III. And, from hence, it's easie to guess, how God
inflicts this spiritual Judgment upon unworthy Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>By a gradual withdrawing his Holy Spirit from them;</hi>
This Spirit is called <hi>Oyl,</hi> Heb. 1. 9. and <hi>Unction,</hi> or
<hi>Anointing,</hi> 1 Joh. 2. 27. Whatever the quantity of that
Oil was, that was put in their Lamps; as that abates, so
the strength of their Soul abates, and from hence comes
Spiritual Weakness, Sickness, and Death. The Spirit
of God is the Pillar that supports the House; if this
Prop be removed, the Inference is easie, that the House
will not be of any long standing. There are general
Gifts of the Spirit of God, common to good and bad
Men under the Gospel, and there are some, that are pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
to those that walk after the Spirit; and, as in an
unworthy Receiver, we can suppose none but general
Gifts; so even these, upon his Abuse, and misemploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of them, are gradually removed, as Men take meat
and victuals away from insolent Beggars, that throw
their Gift upon a Dunghil; and as a charitable Pension
is withdrawn, when we find, that the Party, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd
it, spends it in Ale-houses and Taverns, or in
Play.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="383" facs="tcp:103387:198"/>
2. <hi>By a gradual permitting the Devil to exercise his Power
and Jurisdiction upon them.</hi> God doth not very frequently
suffer the Enemy to fly upon the Offender with all his
force, or to ruin him at once, but he lengthens his Chain by
degrees, to see, whether the Sinner will yet give himself
leave to think, and attempt to be freed from that intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Yoak and Slavery; but, that tenderness and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of Almighty God becoming fruitless and ineffectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
the Judge gives the Executioner greater liberty to
darken his Mind, to pervert his Will, and to sear his
Conscience. Time was, when but one Devil was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to Tyrannize over him; but if instead of being
angry and displeas'd at that single foe, the unworthy
Communicant embraces, and makes him his friend, then
that <hi>Devil takes with him seven other Spirits more wicked
than himself, and they enter in, and dwell there, and the last
state of that Man is worse than the first,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>Matth.
12. 45.</hi> Nor is there any thing of injustice in these pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
of God. For,</p>
            <p>1. It is nothing but <hi>Lex Talionis,</hi> a just Retaliation, a
Rule, whereby God ordinarily governs himself in the
execution of his Judgements. <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s. 6. 4.</hi> He tells <hi>Judah</hi>
and <hi>Ephraim, Your Goodness is as a Morning Cloud, and as
the early Dew it passes away.</hi> The Judgment therefore
is made proportionable, <hi>Hos. 13. 3. Therefore they shall be
as the Morning Cloud, and as the early Dew that passes away,</hi>
so here; the Sin is spiritual, the Judgment is so too. The
unworthy Receiver wrongs his own Soul, and, in his
Soul, the marks of God's Wrath appear.</p>
            <p>2. God, in this case, doth no more than what we
our selves do, and think our selves very reasonable and
just for doing so. A Father reduces his spend-thrift Son
to a smaller Allowance, and the ground that will not
bear any thing after a world of Toil, we Dung, and
Dig, and Manure no more. In this manner, and for
Reasons <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ike these, God withdraws his Holy Spirit from
the unworthy Receiver.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="384" facs="tcp:103387:199"/>
3. As the Devil is God's Minister of Justice, his Jay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor
and Hangman, so he may justly make use of him to
judge and lash the unworthy Receiver, the rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he wilfully hearkens to the base suggestions of his
sworn Enemy; and who finds fault with a Prince or
Magistrate for sending an Executioner to behead or
hang those that have committed Treason, or conspired
against their lawful Sovereign.</p>
            <p>4. That God doth gradually send this Spiritual Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon unworthy Receivers, this speaks his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
Compassion and Patience, and shews, how loth
he is to give up <hi>Ephraim,</hi> how loth he is to deliver up
<hi>Israel</hi> to the rage of the Enemy, how loth he is to make
them as <hi>Admah,</hi> and to set them as <hi>Zeboim;</hi> so that
there is Charity mingled with the Justice, and, in the
midst of his Anger, he remembers Mercy.</p>
            <p>IV. And this will give us occasion to enquire, which
of these two Judgments is greater, the Temporal or the
Spiritual. And here, if we consider the mischief done
by them, we must conclude and assert, that the Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
is greater. For,</p>
            <p>1. Pain, and sickness of Body, may yet bring a Man,
or drive a Man, to a true Repentance, and a sight of
the Errors of his ways, as we proved in the foregoing
Chapter; but this Spiritual Weakness makes the way,
and passage, to Repentance, more difficult, and the
more any thing doth hinder a Man from Repentance,
the more dangerous it is. Spiritual Weakness, Sickness,
and Death, supposes, that the faculties, which should be
chiefly employed in the product of Repentance, are
out of order, and violated; such as the Understanding
the Will, and the Affections. Bodily Sickness very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
puts these into a new fermentation, and a strong de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
after Spiritual Things. But when the very Tools,
whereby the Soul is to work, are blunt, and their edge
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:103387:199"/>
rebated, or are become rusty and useless, the work is
very likely to be left undone. <hi>If therefore the light that
is in thee, be darkness, how great is that darkness!</hi> saith
our Saviour, <hi>Matth. 5. 23.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. The Spiritual Judgment is the more dangerous,
because it is less perceiv'd, and taken notice of, than Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
sickness. If a Man feel the smart and pain of his
Wounds and Sores, they oblige him to seek out for a
Physician for Remedy, for Counsel and Advice; and
so we find it is, for the most part, with all Diseases of
the Body, which cause anguish and grief, and great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience
and disorder in the Body; yet, among
these various distempers, some there are, where the poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
creeps along in the secret parts, and Men perceive
it not, till it seizes upon the Vitals, invades the very
Heart, and tolls the Bell for Death; and these we count the
most dangerous. Of this nature, is Spiritual sickness and
weakness. It leaves the Body in the same temper it
found it in, causes no prickings in the Back, no stitches
in the side, no disturbance in the Head. It lets Men
eat and drink, and sleep and walk, and do their business;
and as to the outward Man, they feel no inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
which makes them think, that they have nothing
of a distemper about them, that all is safe, and they ail
nothing. For this Spiritual sickness cannot be perceiv'd
without Thinking, and Self-examination, which being
neglected, Men feel it not; whence it comes to pass,
that it spreads insensibly in the dark, while Men are
asleep, and, by degrees, corrupts the Soul, till all its
goodness be consumed; and consequently, this Spiritual
Judgment is greater than the Corporal.</p>
            <p>3. The Spiritual Judgment is a sign of God's
greater anger too; and though it will not enter into
the thoughts of a sensual Man that it is so, or that
any thing can be a sign of God's Anger, but what
relates to losses, and disappointments, and crosses in
the outward Man, and in the World; yet enlighten'd
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:103387:200"/>
Souls have ever look'd upon Spiritual sickness and Death,
as a sign of God's heavier wrath and indignation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
in this case, God doth as it were let Men alone,
leaves them to themselves, and his not punishing of
them with Bodily troubles, looks like an aversion from
their Persons, and so much we may guess from what
we read, <hi>Hos. 4. 14, 17.</hi>
            </p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The Preceding Considerations reduced into farther
Practice.</head>
               <p>I<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> IF Christ, and his Apostles, press Eating and Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
worthily at this Table, it is, because they
would have our Souls be in perfect health; and they are
then in perfect health, when they rejoyce in the Lord
always. <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> upon that saying, <hi>Cant. 1. 13.
A bundle of Myrrhe is my well-beloved unto me,</hi> observes, that
as Myrrhe preserves Bodies from corruption, so Christ
taken, and contemplated, in the Holy Sacrament, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
the soul from various Diseases. Health is best
known by Fruits and Actions; and as a sick Man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
perform, what the healthy doth; so that Christian,
that doth not act like a healthy Man, can boast of no
great matter he hath receiv'd in this Holy Ordinance.
This is intended to give our Souls the strength of a <hi>Lion,</hi>
the swiftness of <hi>Eagles,</hi> the alacrity of Angels, and the
temper which was in the incarnate Son of God; and if
we Receive worthily, we shall certainly feel these ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,
in some degree at least; For it's plain, that they
are felt by others, that are worthy Communicants, and
what should hinder us from feeling the same, if we come
furnish'd with the same qualifications? Those that are
acquainted only with Men, as carnal as themselves,
may possibly think, that when we talk of things of this
nature, we speak Spiritual Romances, and tell them
Stories next to Fables: But those that have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versant

empty Name, or a fruitless Title, but makes them fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Trees; and it must needs be so, <hi>for they, that be
planted in the House of the Lord, shall flourish in the Courts
of our God,</hi> saith the <hi>Psalmist, Psal. 92. 13.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>II. Who, that seriously considers the Spiritual Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
we have spoken of, must not deplore the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of abundance of nominal Christians, that Receive
worthily? The Persons upon whom this Spiritual Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is executed, are not far from every one of us. To
find them out, we need not send you to the Sands of
<hi>Africa,</hi> nor to the <hi>Lybian</hi> Desarts, nor to <hi>Barbarians,</hi>
nor to <hi>Negro's</hi> and <hi>Americans:</hi> No, these very Persons,
you may see and know at home, and in the midst of our
mixt Congregations. How many have I known, that
have come to this Holy Sacrament, and, after that,
have grown worse than ever? Their Drunkenness, and
Lewdness, their Selfishness, and Covetousness, their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant,
and Ungodly Speeches and Actions, which
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:103387:201"/>
before were but <hi>Embrio's</hi> and Infants, after Receiving,
have become Gyants and strong Men: What an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is this of their unworthy Receiving? What an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
of God's Judgment? What an argument, that
God hath withdrawn his Holy Spirit from them? What
an argument that they are left to the power of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil?
O that they were sensible, what a Judgment this
is! O that they knew what a fearful State this is! O that
their Eyes were open to see, that they are in the very
suburbs of Destruction! O that the Vail were taken
away, that they might behold the death, the ruin, the
misery, the wrath, the indignation of God, they run
into! O thou, that openest the Eyes of the Blind, and
raisest them that are bow'd down, and loosest the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners,
open the Eyes of these unhappy Souls, that they
may see the precipice they stand upon, and turn back
and save themselves from this untoward Generation.</p>
               <p>III. Let us all very seriously believe, that our Souls
are capable of sickness, and misery, and death, as well
as our Bodies. Indeed they cannot die, so as to cease,
or to be annihilated, for they are not made of Earth
and matter, and contrary humours and principles, as our
Bodies are, but certainly they can die to God's Favour,
and to a sense of Eternity. This Belief, if it be sound,
and strong, cannot but have a mighty influence upon
our Lives. If we believe this, as we ought, with ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions
of the danger we are in, we shall be as much
afraid of things that will cast our Souls into sickness, or
hurry them into death, and misery, as we are afraid of
going to a Pest-house, where People lye languishing
under their Plague-sores. Ah! sinful Man, how couldst
thou neglect coming to the Supper of the Lord, if thou
didst believe, that this neglect will bring a Consumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
on thy Soul? How could'st thou Receive with an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent
Heart, if thou didst believe, that thy impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
will kill thy Soul? How durst thou venture on
those sins, that are poison and venom to thy Soul?
How could'st thou be so careless of the approaching
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:103387:201"/>
Judgment of God, if thou didst believe that this care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesness
will infallibly bring a Palsie upon thy Soul? How
could sinful delights be so charming to thee, if thou didst
believe, that they will throw thy Soul into a violent Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver?
Why shouldst thou make thy Soul sick, when the
great Physician offers thee health, and Salvation? The
sickness of thy Soul is much harder to be cured, than the
most Chronical distemper of the Body. Not but that
God can heal it, as easily as the other, and need say no
more, than <hi>Christ</hi> to the <hi>Paralytick in the Gospel, Arise,
take up thy Bed, and Walk,</hi> and thou art presently whole;
but he will not, except thou be willing too. This thy
Spiritual sickness is wilful, that makes Christ backward
to remove it; and if ever thy Soul be cured, it must
cost thee great Mortifications, Rivers of Tears, strong
Throws and Agonies, and Troubles in the inward Man,
and who would make work for such a costly and labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Cure, that may be well without it? Let the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician
be never so skilful, if the Patient will not follow
his prescriptions, what hopes can there be of his Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very?
If thou wert but willing to follow Christ's pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions,
thy Cure might be effected, even after thou
hast brought thy Soul to the mouth of the Pit, and to
the brink of the Grave; and if you ask me, what these
prescriptions are, I must tell you, that they are these
following.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>1. Like New-born Babes to imbibe the sincere Milk of
the Word, that you may grow thereby, if so be ye have tasted,
that the Lord is Gracious, to whom coming, as to a living
Stone, disallow'd indeed of Men, but chosen of God and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious,
ye also, as lively Stones, are built up a Spiritual House,
an Holy Priesthood, to offer up Spiritual Sacrifices, acceptable
to God by Jesus Christ,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 2, 3, 4. weak and sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Persons have need of Milk; we use it in Bodily Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seases,
when they have weaken'd the Body; and, it
seems, it's necessary also for the recovery of Souls, wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken'd
by Sin; but then the Milk is not such, as Cows,
and Sheep, and Goats do give, but it is the Word of the
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:103387:202"/>
Lord, which endures for ever; and to apply our selves
to pondering, and meditating in it, and to make it the
rule of our life, and manners, is drinking of that Milk.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2. To pull out the Right Eye, and to cut off the Right
Hand, Matth. 5. 29, 30. i. e.</hi> To shun those Looks, and
Actions, which are Provocations to Sin. As he, that
means to recover of Bodily sickness, must avoid all
things, that would irritate the morbifick matter; so he,
whose Soul is sick, and would be cured, must carefully
avoid the occasions of those sins, which have made him
sick; and he that would be drunk no more, must avoid
the Company that used to perswade him to intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance;
and he that would be tempted no more by the
Harlot, that drew him in, <hi>must not come near her house,</hi>
Prov. 5. 8.</p>
               <p>3. Not to repine at the bitter draughts, <hi>Christ</hi> gives
you to drink of; but to say, as he in his Agonies, <hi>The
Cup which my Father hath given me, shall not I drink it?</hi>
Joh. 18. 11. Whether this bitter Cup be the Cup of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification,
of Fasting, of Severities, of being reveng'd
upon thy self, and of deep Humiliation, or the Cup of
Bodily affliction; if he bids you drink of it, it must be
thankfully taken, else expect no cure; and that which
ought to encourage us to drink of it, is this, that this
bitterness will end at last in sweetness unspeakable, and
ineffable Consolations.</p>
               <p>4. To sell all with the Merchant in the Gospel, to
get the Pearl of Price, <hi>i. e. God's love and favour,</hi>
Matth. 13. 45, 46. The meaning is, nothing must
come in competition with the great concern of your
Salvation, nothing must be suffered to be laid in the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
with Eternal Happiness; whatever would preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
that, must be rejected, and left to those that know
not how to prize it. To secure that, all must be ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd,
and if even Father and Mother should be the
tempters to discourage us from it, even their Friendship
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:103387:202"/>
must be lost, and all that we expected from them count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unworthy to be compared with the Glory, which ere
long shall be revealed in us.</p>

            <div type="prayer">
               <head>The PRAYER,</head>
               <p>MOST Glorious God, and Father of our Lord Jesus
Christ! Heaven is thy Throne, and the Earth is thy
Foot-stool. Where is the House that Man can build unto
thee? And where is the Place of thy Rest? Thou dwellest
not in Temples made with Hands; yet in an humble, sound,
sincere and pure Heart, thou hast promised to fix thy Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.
Oh, that my Heart were so! When shall I be rid of
my vain, foolish, wicked, and dangerous Thoughts? Oh!
When wilt thou purge and cleanse this House from the Rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bish
which annoys it? When wilt thou adorn my Soul with
profound Humility, which may be an Invitation of thy Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Presence? How apt am I to look off from Thee! How
apt to mind poor transitory Things! How little am I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with that Fervency of Spirit which I see in others!
Great Physician! Heal thou me: Thou hast healed Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands;
Oh, let me be one of that Number. It may be, of
all that Multitude, there was none so miserable as I am;
yet no Spots, no Stains are too hard for Thee to wash out.
I have delighted in my Filthiness, and, with the Swine, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
pleasure in the Mire. Oh, Let me consider how nobly
I am born; and hate that mean and servile Spirit! I am
born of God: So thy Apostle tells me. Oh, Let my God be
ever in my Heart, and let me do God-like Things, even
Things that savour of Heaven, and a Super-natural Temper.
Touch my Soul, sweet Jesu! Touch it with the Rays of thy
Favour in this Sacrament, that I may seek after Thee alone,
think on Thee alone, and love Thee alone. Chase away all
sinful Sickness from me, and make me sick of Love; that
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:103387:203"/>
joyfully, without Tediousness, I may continue in Well-doing.
Thou art a Saviour! Be thou so to me; and save me from
my Sins. Give me an healthful Soul, a good Conscience,
and a sound Mind, and Purity of Heart; and with that
Purity, frequent Rejoycing in thy Name, Tranquility of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
Multitude of holy Thoughts, Innocence of Life, ardent
Love, and Everlasting Charity. Let no Temptations defile
me; but let these rather purge, and joyn, and unite me to
Thee. Give me a constant Zeal for thy Honour and Glory;
and let me be for ever delighted with thy Praises. <hi>Amen,
Amen.</hi>

            <head type="sub">Of Damnation, which the Unworthy Receiver
Eats and Drinks to himself.</head>
            <argument>
               <head>The CONTENTS.</head>
               <p>The Word made use of by St. Paul, in threatning Unworthy
Receivers, ambiguous on purpose to fright them from the
Sin. How Men eat and drink their Damnation in this
holy Sacrament. The Justice of God, in inflicting Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
on Unworthy Receivers, vindicated. The Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of Damnation being denounced by St. Paul, to the
prophane Corinthians, that came drunk to this holy Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance;
how that can be applied to sinful Men in this
Age, who are not in a possibility of coming drunk to the
Lord's Table, since the Eucharist is with us administred
and received in the Morning, and most of those who come,
do come with some Preparation. Whence it comes, that
Damnation doth not fright Men more, it being the
greatest Misery Man is capable of. The Severity of this
Threatning puts Communicants in mind, what a Value and
Esteem they are to have for the Death of Christ. Yet it
is no just Discouragement from Approaching with sincere
Desires and Resolutions to become conformable to Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus.
The Prayer.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>I. THE Judgment the unworthy Receiver pulls up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
himself, is not only Temporal, but Eternal
too. To this End, I have already told you, that the
Word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, used by the Apostle, in his Threatning
denounced against unworthy Receivers, signifies not
only Judgment in general, but also Damnation. And,
indeed, the Holy Ghost doth purposely make use some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:103387:204"/>
of ambiguous Words, especially in Threatnings,
to rouze Men the more from their Slumber, and to
give them notice, that if the lesser Punishment, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in the Expression, is either delayed, or cannot
prevail, that then the greater, included in the same
Word, shall take place. Thus the Word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Sheol,</hi>
in the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> used much in Threatnings, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
both the <hi>Grave,</hi> and <hi>Hell;</hi> and in Comminations
against wicked Men, it doth not only signifie an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely
Grave, but a far greater Punishment beyond it;
even <hi>Eternal Darkness,</hi> and Everlasting Howlings; to
shew, that if the former Danger cannot fright, the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
shall, when it is too late to repent. And so here;
the Word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, including both Temporal Judgment,
and Damnation, we must believe, the <hi>Apostle</hi> hath some
farther Prospect than this present Life; and that he uses
the Word, not only to terrifie the unworthy Receiver
with Sickness and Weakness of the Body, and a Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
and Temporal Judgment; but at the same time
bids him take heed, that in case any of the former doth
not, for Reasons best known to Providence, light up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him; or, in case the Thoughts of the former do
not work upon him, and transform him into a better
Man, he doth not run himself into Hell-Fire, and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Misery. It is plainly to tell him, that since the
Word includes both Judgments, Temporal, and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
he hath no reason to flatter himself, that it will be
only a Temporal judgment; but may justly fear, he
shall in our God's Everlasting Indignation. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our Church retains both Significations of the Word,
in her Exhortation before the Sacrament: <hi>So is the
Danger great, if we Receive the same unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily;
for then we are guilty of the Body and
Blood of Christ our Saviour, we Eat and
Drink our own Damnation, not considering
the Lord's Body, we kindle God's Wrath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
us, we provoke him to plague us with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Diseases, and sundry kinds of Death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="395" facs="tcp:103387:204"/>
II. How an unworthy Communicant <hi>eats and drinks
Damnation to himself,</hi> is the next thing we are to explain.
And this he doth this following Way:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1. He makes himself obnoxious to the fierce Anger of the
Judge,</hi> that is to decide the Controversie of his Life and
Death to all Eternity; and this Judge is the Son of God,
<hi>Christ Jesus;</hi> who hath protested, that <hi>Not every one
who saith unto him, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Heaven; but he that doth the Will of his Father,
which is in Heaven;</hi> and therefore will say unto them in
the last Day, <hi>I know you not; depart from me, ye Workers
of Iniquity.</hi> And there is nothing more certain, than
that the unworthy Receiver is resolved not to do the
Will of his Father which is in Heaven; whose Will is,
that Men <hi>should honour the Son, as they do the Father,</hi> Joh.
5. 23. <hi>i. e.</hi> believe in him, as they do in the Father;
and come to this Sacrament, like Persons redeemed
from their vain Conversation, resolved to war against
the Lusts of the Flesh, like Soldiers of the Cross; and
to remember the Death of the Son of God here, with
that Respect and Devotion they owe to God; resolved
to live and die with him, like Persons who have listed
themselves under his Colours, with an Intent to fight
against his Enemies, and to take heed they do not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour
the Son of God, <hi>by an evil Heart of Unbelief, in
departing from the Living God.</hi> This is the Will of God;
and since Christ, the Judge of the World, is the Person
appointed to examine whether this Will of God hath
been obeyed, the unworthy Receiver, dying in Impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
and coming before him, and it appearing that
he hath nothing less than the Will of God; professed,
indeed, that he would do it, pretended Service and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
to him, and yet done his own Will, though
exhorted and moved to do the Will of God by number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
Arguments, Arguments big with the greatest Charms;
what can his Obstinacy cause, but Anger in the Judge,
Anger implacable, since he would continue dead and
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:103387:205"/>
unconcerned under the lively Oracles of Heaven, and
under the most lively Representations of the Love of
God? The Effect of which Anger, is, the Sentence of
Everlasting Condemnation; <hi>Depart from me, ye Cursed,
into Everlasting Fire,</hi> &amp;c. Matth. 25. 41. And for this
Reason the <hi>Psalmist</hi> calls to all, <hi>Kiss the Son, lest he be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry,
and ye perish from the right Way, when his Anger shall
be kindled but a little,</hi> Psal 2. 11.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2. He puts himself in the same State and Condition, that
other ungodly Sinners are in;</hi> to whom is reserved the Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Darkness for ever: And that State and Condition
is Wilful Disobedience to the Gospel of our Lord Jesus
Christ. And what the Consequence of this State is,
St. <hi>Paul</hi> explains, <hi>2 Thes. 1. 7, 8, 9. The Lord Jesus shall
be revealed from Heaven, with his mighty Angels, in fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
Fire; taking Vengeance on them that know not God,
and that obey not the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ; who
shall be punished with Everlasting Destruction from the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of the Lord, and from the Glory of his Power.</hi> And
that this is the unworthy Receiver's Condition, is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
from hence, because he knows not God, <hi>i. e.</hi> he will
not know him, nor obey the Gospel of our Lord <hi>Jesus
Christ.</hi> He might know that God is an holy God, and
hath called him to Holiness, and is not to be put off
with blind, lame, and slovenly Devotion; and yet he
will not, nor doth he, obey the Gospel, which obliges
him, by virtue of the Grace of God appearing to all
Men, to renounce Ungodliness and Worldly Lusts.
This Ungodliness, and these Worldly Lusts, he retains,
and cherishes, and makes much of, notwithstanding his
coming to the Lord's Table; and so putting himself in
the same State and Condition that other ungodly Men
are, no wonder if he makes himself liable to the same
Damnation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3. He makes himself fit Company for the Damned, and
the Sufferers in Hell.</hi> Those that are in that miserable
State, did as he doth; and he doth as they did. They
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:103387:205"/>
suffer'd the Profits and Pleasures of the World to justle out
a serious Sense of Religion; so doth the unworthy Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.
They had <hi>a Form of Godliness, and denied the Power
thereof;</hi> so doth he. They, some of them at least, came
to this Sacrament with unmortified Lusts, with unsubdued
Passions of Anger and Pride, and with ungovernable De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
after the World, and had no real Intent to become
Proselytes of Righteousness; so doth he. They did not
think that the holy Sacrament was such an Inforcive to
a Change of Life, as Divines talked of; so doth he.
They made no great matter of this Ordinance, but
thought it expedient to comply with the Custom of the
Country, and the Usages of the Church they lived in,
and that was all; and so doth he. They made nothing
of promising and breaking their solemn Promises to
God; no more doth he: And being like them in Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
no wonder if he be like them in Torments too:
Being their Companion in their Sins, 'tis just he should
be a Companion with them in their Misery: Having
been their Associate in Hypocrisie, 'tis fit he should have
his Portion with Hypocrites.</p>
            <p>III. But here the Sinner, I know, will be apt to cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
and say, What Justice can there be in it, that
God, for eating a Piece of Bread, and for drinking a few
Drops of Wine irreverently and unworthily, without
observing some Punctilio's, and Nicer Rules of Divinity,
should inflict Eternal Damnation upon a poor Creature?
To which I answer,</p>
            <p>1. Every supreme and absolute Law-giver hath liberty
to set what Penalties he thinks fit upon the Breaches of
his Law. If he will appoint a Punishment that is very
dreadful, for a certain Offence, the Interest of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
is, to keep the Law, not to quarrel with the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
At this rate, a Man might plead, What great
matter is there in opening a Window at Night, to get
into an House, to steal some small, inconsiderable thing
in the House? And shall this be made <hi>Felony, without
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:103387:206"/>
Benefit of the Clergy?</hi> All wise Law-givers have their
Reason, why they inflict severe Penalties upon Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders;
and 'tis fit that an Infinite Majesty should both
threaten and appoint Punishments suitable to his Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur.
Where the Law, and the Sanction of it, is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
known, Men do not accuse the Law-giver of
of Cruelty, if the Offender runs himself into Danger;
but rather blame the senseless and foolish Man, who,
knowing the Severity of the Sanction, might have easily
denied himself in his sinful Purchase, and secured his
Life and Welfare: And the less the Fault is, for which
a severe Punishment is appointed, the more easily might
it have been avoided; and not to avoid it, when the
Forbearance was so easie, is an Argument of strange
Presumption; so that the Contempt and Presumption
are so severely punished, and not the Fault it self. Let
us apply this to the Case in hand: The Supreme Law-giver
thinks fit to inflict Damnation on the unworthy
Receiver. Either this unworthy Receiving is a very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e
Sin, or a very great one: If a great one, the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
cannot be thought too great; for it is propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
to the Greatness of the Authority which is despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
and to the infinite and incomprehensible Mercy
which is slighted; not to mention, that unworthy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
is a Complication of many Sins, and more than
one go into the Composition. If it be little, it is more
easily shunned; and then the Presumption comes to be
very great, and that Presumption is justly punished with
great Severity. Besides, Who can judge so well of the
Contempt, and the heinousness of it, as he that knows
all things, and can best judge how great the Indignity is
which is offered to God in the Sin? Nay, the Greatness
of the Penalty discovers the Greatness of the Impiety,
the Foulness of the Crime, the deep Dye of the Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression,
and the dangerous Tendency of the Offence.
A Christian, from the Greatness of the Penalty, is to
conclude, there must be more in the Sin, than appears
to his Eyes; and to infer, that if the Offence were not
greater than ordinary, so severe a Penalty would not
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:103387:206"/>
have been laid upon it. So that, at the same time, the
Greatness of the Punishment serves to fright the Sinner
from continuing in his Sin, against he comes next to the
Table of the Lord; and is a strong Engagement to him
to take nobler Resolutions, to come with greater Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
and with better Purposes, that he may escape
Damnation.</p>
            <p>2. That which makes the Penalty just, is, the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
the Apostle gives, <hi>1 Cor. 11. 29. Because he discerns
not the Lord's Body.</hi> And what is it, not to discern the
Lord's Body?</p>
            <p>1. The unworthy Receiver discerns not, that the
Bread and Wine in this Ordinance, set apart for an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Use, and consecrated by the Words of Institution,
represents the Body and Blood of the Son of God:
Which Consideration should over-awe him into the
greatest Reverence and Devotion. He considers not
that by laying his Hands upon the Body of the Son of
God, he vows Faith and Allegiance to him; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
refusing that Faith and Allegiance in his Actions,
is supposed to look upon that Bread as common, which
God hath made representative of the greatest Mystery.
He considers not, that by eating of this Bread, his Soul,
at the same time, pretends to feed on the Body of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ,</hi> and to apply the Mercies and Benefits of his
Death; whereby he brings himself under an Obligation
to live as a Member of Christ's Mystical Body; not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Lusts of the Flesh, but according to the
Will of him that bought him at so great a Price. And
being, at the same time, unresolved to do so, he mocks
the Lord <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> and plays with Vows made in a
place where Angels give their Attendance.</p>
            <p>2. He discerns not, he considers not what it is, for
God to take a Body upon him for a poor Sinner's sake,
to redeem him from Damnation. For God to take a
Body upon him, is a thing so astonishing, so miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:103387:207"/>
that if the greatest Prince of the World should
voluntarily make himself a Beggar, and wallow in Dirt
and Slime, to deliver a Slave out of Prison in a Foreign
Country, it is not so much, nor a thing of that great
Consequence. For God to take a Body upon him, that
he might die for the Sinner, and make him capable of
inheriting Everlasting Bliss, is a Mercy which runs so
high, that Reason is at a loss, and it is enough to make
the Mind grow giddy at the Consideration; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently,
it is so great an Engagement to devote our
selves to the Service of that God who hath done this,
that no Obligation can be thought greater, or more
likely to prevail with Men of Common Sense and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity.
And therefore, for the unworthy Receiver
not to discern or consider this, must be a Contempt
that is without a Parallel.</p>
            <p>3. He considers not, that it is the Body of his <hi>Lord</hi>
and <hi>Master</hi> that is present in the Figure, in this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance;
even the Body of that <hi>Lord,</hi> whose Servant he
is, and owns himself to be. He discerns not, that in
eating of the holy Bread, he acknowledges. <hi>Christ Jesus</hi>
to be his Lord and Master, at whose Beck he means to
run, by whose Command he intends to act, and by
whose Will he designs to be ruled. So that the unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Receiver runs himself into strange Contradictions;
He acknowledges at the Receiving of the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> that
<hi>Christ</hi> is his <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Master,</hi> and yet is not willing to
be govern'd by his Laws; his Lust and sinful Desires
still continue his <hi>Masters;</hi> the <hi>Devil</hi> is still his <hi>Master,</hi>
the <hi>World</hi> is still his <hi>Master,</hi> and Sin still reigns in his
Mortal Body; <hi>Christ</hi> is only his Master in <hi>shew,</hi> these
in <hi>good earnest;</hi> he in <hi>Complement,</hi> these in <hi>sober Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:</hi>
And when this Contempt hath all these Aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
in it, who can complain that God is unjust in
inflicting Damnation on the unworthy Receiver, if he
turns not?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="401" facs="tcp:103387:207"/>
IV. But still they were only the <hi>prophane Corinthinians,</hi>
against whom this Judgment is denounced; Men who
came <hi>drunk</hi> to this holy Sacrament: And since no Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
in this Age can be presumed, or supposed, to come
in such a Posture to this Sacrament, why should the
Penalty mentioned by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> be enforced upon Men
now living, who are not guilty of the same Sin, and
in no possibility almost of committing it, <hi>i. e.</hi> of <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
drunk and disguised to the Lord's Table?</hi> To which,
I answer:</p>
            <p>1. Not to mention, that <hi>Whatever things are written
afore-time, are written for our Learning,</hi> 'tis a great Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take,
that the Apostle restrains the Penalty to being
drunk with Wine, or any other strong Liquor, in the
Use of this Ordinance. He applies it, not only to this
Sin, but also to Want of Self-Examination, and not to
discern the Lord's Body; as will appear to any Man
that compares the 28th and 29th Verses in that Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter;
I mean, the 11th of the <hi>First Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians.</hi>
And besides, Though their coming drunk to
this Sacrament gives Occasion to the Discourse, yet he
makes a general Inference, or Conclusion; <hi>He that,</hi> or
<hi>Whosoever eats and drinks unworthily, eats and drinks Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
to himself.</hi> So that if there be more Ways of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
Receiving, than coming drunk to this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
it will follow, that they all come under the
reach of this Penalty.</p>
            <p>2. If one wilful Sin, or Sin allowed of, or Sin of
Temper, Custom and Inclination, which a Man is not
heartily resolved to strive against, makes him an unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Receiver, another must be supposed to do the same;
for all Sins allowed of, are of the same Nature, though
the Object be changed: And therefore, whether a Man
be loth or unresolved to part with his drunken Cups, or
unresolved to mortifie his Envy, or Malice, or Pride,
or Hatred, or Revengeful Desires, or Opprobrious
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:103387:208"/>
Language, or Injustice, or Cheating, or Lying, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
the Change of the Object makes no Alteration in the
unworthy Receiving; and therefore, no Alteration in
the Penalty. If a <hi>Corinthian Christian,</hi> that professed
himself a Member of Christ's Church had come drunk
to the Lord's Table to Day, and come again in the
same Posture, and in the same Disguise, the <hi>Lord's Day</hi>
following, there is no Dispute of it, but coming again
with the same Sin upon his Back, would have made
himself an unworthy Receiver: And if not parting with
a known Sin, against he came next, made him an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
<hi>Communicant,</hi> it stands to reason, that he who
is given to lying, and to Cheating, or to any other
known Sin, and comes to the Sacrament without a full
purpose to reform it, draws the same Guilt upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
that the prophane <hi>Corinthians</hi> did. 'Tis true, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with the Guilt of other Sins allowed of, is not so
scandalous a thing as coming drunk; but with respect
to God, who is offended by it, and against whose
Laws the Sin is committed, they are of the same Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
with Coming <hi>disguised,</hi> or <hi>drunk,</hi> to the Lord's
Table; and therefore such Men are liable to the same
Penalty.</p>
            <p>3. Though a vicious Person in this Age cannot well
come drunk to this Sacrament, because it is commonly
received in the Morning, and most Men make some
little Preparation, and approach sober, yet he may
come drunk with evil Habits of Sin; and then he comes
drunk with evil Habits, when he is so besotted with the
Sins which Custom, or Company, or something else,
hath made sweet, and easie, and pleasant to him, that
whatever is feigned and pretended, as to general Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses,
to mend his Life before he receives, yet he is not
heartily resolved to part with such particular Sins as he is
very prone to; and all the Love and Charity set before
him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n the Lord's Supper, cannot work in him a Change
of Mind, or an unfeigned Resolution to use the proper
Means to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hake off the Sin which is become natural to
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:103387:208"/>
him: And whether a Man come to the Sacrament drunk
in a natural Sense, or drunk in a spiritual Sense; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he come to it drunk with Wine, or drunk with Sin,
there is no great difference in the Crime, the Sin is still
the same; especially, since all those who lay claim to
the Promise of Pardon and Salvation, are peremptorily
commanded to <hi>cleanse themselves from all Filthiness, both
of Flesh and Spirit,</hi> 2 Cor. 7. 1.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The Preceding Considerations reduced to Practice.</head>
               <p>I. HEre I cannot but take notice, how little the
things which are not seen with our Bodily Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans,
though of the greatest Consequence, are minded
by the Generality, even those that pretend to believe
them. Damnation is, certainly, the most dreadful thing
imaginable; yet most Men make so little of it, that the
Fear of losing Twenty or Thirty Pounds discomposes
and disorders them more than the Apprehension that
they shall lose the Light of God's Countenance for ever.
What can we imagine to be the Reason of it? Surely,
it must be, because it is not seen: And therefore Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
do not heartily believe it, nor seriously think of it.
And yet, when a thing is very certain, and God hath
spoke it, and we have all the Assurances that the thing
is capable of, that it is so, though it cannot be seen with
the Eyes of Flesh; yet being certain, the Thoughts of
it surely might effect, and work upon, and discompose
the Soul, in a manner, as much as Sight and Sense. But
here lies the Misery; the greatest part of Men are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinking
Animals; they believe, but think not; they
think, but not of that which concerns them most. This
makes Damnation only a big Word to set off a violent
Passion, but it frights not; nay, is so far from frighting,
that not a few do barbarously wish it to their own Souls;
yet still, not only Faith, but Reason, saith, there is such
a thing; and the Justice of a Supream Being requires so
much: So that he that will be frighted with Damnation,
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:103387:209"/>
must first deliberately examine the Reasons which may
convince him of the Being and Reality of it, and then
reflect and ruminate upon the Terrour and Consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of it: And if this be done, and the Divine Assistance,
which must co-operate with all spiritual Endeavours, to
make them effectual, be heartily implored, Sin, Vanity
and Lust, and foolish Desires must necessarily fall, and
faint before it, and a Change of Life cannot but follow,
and a Man's Carefulness to please God must needs be
the happy Consequences of it.</p>
               <p>II. The Penalty God inflicts upon unworthy Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
shews how God would have us value and esteem
what he hath done for us in <hi>Christ Jesus.</hi> The Death
of Christ for poor Sinners God looks upon to be so
great a thing, that he expects that every Soul, upon
hearing of it, and sufficient Demonstration of the Truth
of it, should be so surprized with the Mercy, as imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
to throw off the Works of Darkness, and put off
the Old Man, with all his deceitful Lusts, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
an obedient Subject of <hi>Christ</hi>'s Kingdom. God
sets that high Value upon it, that he expects that every
Soul, to whom the News comes, immediately lay Force
upon the Kingdom of Heaven, rejoyce that he is made
capable of Pardon, and an Inheritance incorruptible;
and for the Glory set before him, fall to work, and seek
first the Kingdom of God, and the Righteousness there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of:
And therefore, for any Person who professes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
a Christian, to entertain this Message coldly, lazily,
and with Indifferency, is an Act so unworthy, so dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory
from the Sublimity and Excellency of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
that we need not wonder if he lashes this low,
slavish and pitiful Temper of ours with the severest Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance.
Can we think, because we have no extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Esteem of the Mercy, that God will set light by it
because we do? Oh! Let us entertain it with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundest
Respect, and the deepest Veneration; and
think our selves the happiest Creatures living, that we
have this Act of Divine Bounty and Charity revealed to
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:103387:209"/>
us. But then, it is impossible we should think our selves
so, except we walk worthy of the glorious News, and
transcribe on our Lives the glorious Zeal, and Fervour,
and Sincerity of the Apostles, and Primitive Believers.</p>
               <p>III. As this severe Threatning, denounced against un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
Receivers, is the strongest Dissuasive possible
from Eating and Drinking unworthily, so it is no just
Discouragement to Receive with sincere Desires, and
Resolutions to become conformable to Christ's Holiness.
God frights from sinning, not from doing well; from
wronging our own Souls, not from Endeavours to save
them; from Impenitence, not from true Repentance.
All that is to be done, <hi>Christian,</hi> in this Sacrament, in
order to Receiving worthily, is, to lay and prostrate
thy self at the Feet of <hi>Jesus,</hi> and to cry, <hi>Lord, What wilt
thou have me to do? Speak, Lord, for thy Servant hears.</hi>
Such humble Souls escape the Danger, and may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
of a gracious Look from the King of Saints. But
then, if we fall down before the Throne and the Lamb,
and make this Profession, let it come from the Heart,
and let our Tongues speak what our Minds think, and
our Wills mean to stand to; and let our Desires to be
one with him, be such as Simplicity dictates, lest our
Hearts and Tongues not going together, we may be
found Lyars, and fall into Condemnation. And, Oh
that every unworthy Receiver would consider what
Damnation means! Consider it, thou dull and careless
Man; and then tell me, whether <hi>Christ</hi> requires any
thing unreasonable of thee to prevent it? Thou that
runnest from an House on fire, and from a Land-flood,
or Deluge, that threatens to overwhelm thee; wilt not
thou do all thou canst to escape Damnation, that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge
of God's Wrath, and that Fire of his Anger which
no Man can quench? Should this Damnation be thy
Portion at last, we may easily imagine what thy Wishes
will be; the same that all inconsiderate Souls are very
full of, when they have ruin'd and undone themselves:
<hi>Oh, that I had been wise before the Fact, and come to the
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:103387:210"/>
Lord's Table with a better Frame; put on the Lord Jesus,
and made his Vertues and Graces my Study, my Delight, and
my Pattern!</hi> But these are the Wishes of Fools: And, <hi>I
did not think it would come to this pass,</hi> is a Saying, which
we look upon as a Character of a weak, and a Childish
Understanding. Both he that receives unworthily, and
he that never received yet, both have yet Opportunity
to turn from their evil Ways. Therefore, <hi>Seek ye the
Lord, while be m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

near. Let the Wicked forsake his Way, and the unrighteous
Man his Thoughts, and let him return unto the Lord, and he
will have Mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
pardon,</hi> Isa. 55. 6, 7.</p>

and the Hills melt, and the Earth is burnt at thy Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence;

of Men! Yet thou, Lord, art good, and a Strong Hold
in the Day of Trouble; and thou knowest them that trust in
thee. In my Approaches to thy holy Table, let me so reflect
upon thy Mercy, as not to forget thy Justice. Let me so look
upon thy Friendship, as to cast an Eye, withal, upon thy Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to thine Enemies. Thou offerest me thy Friendship in this
Ordinance: How great is thy Goodness! Oh, let me entertain
the Offer with Admiration! God will dwell with simple Man,
and therefore requires a Temple; a Temple, not made with
hew'n Stones, not of polish'd Marble, not of painted Walls;
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:103387:210"/>
but of living and shining Gems, and of such Golden Ornaments
as Rust cannot touch, and Dust cannot blacken; a Temple pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
with the Fire of Love, trimmed with an holy Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation,
and decked with variety of Vertues. Make my Soul,
I beseech thee, such a Temple, and come and fix thy Tents here
for ever. Thou art the Judge to whom I am accountable for
my Receiving: Let me remember, that as that didst rain
down <hi>Manna</hi> from Heaven upon thy People, so thou didst
rain down Fire and Brimstone too upon <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah.</hi>
Let me so rejoyce in the Mercies thou rainest down upon
me in this Sacrament, as to fear thy Judgments in case I abuse
those Mercies. If of every idle Word Men shall give an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
in the Great Day, what Account will they have to give
of prophaning this sublime and mysterious Ordinance! If the
Dust of thy <hi>Apostles</hi> Feet shall bear witness in that Day a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Obstinate and Impenitent, what a Witness will the
Body of the Son of God be against those who would not be
warm'd with the Sight and Contemplation of it into Vertue!
Let these things sink deep into my inward Parts, and teach me
so to triumph in thy Praise, as to tremble at thy Presence! Yet,
Oh, let not my Goodness be the Effect of a slavish Fear of
Damnation, so much as of Love and Delight in thy holy Ways!
Let Kindness do more with me, than Terrour; and let my
Heart melt more with the Sight of thy Condescension, than
with the Sight of thy Flaming Sword. Teach me to serve thee
with Pleasure and Affection; and let the Glory of thy Name
be the End of all my holy Exercises. Let thy Love be ever
fixed in my Heart; and be thou my Rest, my Tranquility, my
Peace, my Meat, my Drink, my Food, my Treasure, my Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session,
and my Portion, for ever, through <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> our

us an example of seasoning our Hearts with this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
Meditation; for before he instituted this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
before he distributed the Bread and Wine to the
Disciples in the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> he contemplates his own Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
in the Paschal Lamb, he ate of. He saw on the
Table a Lamb dead, flead, and roasted at the Fire:
This suggested to him, how himself was, in a few hours
after, to be kill'd, and scourg'd, and feel the heat and fire
of mighty Torments. He saw his Friends eat the Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal
Lamb in haste, and he could not but reflect what
haste his Enemies would make to apprehend him. In
the unleaven'd Bread and the bitter Herbs that were set
before him; he saw the Gall and Vinegar he was to
taste; and if the Disciples, at that time, did eat the
Passover with staves in their hands, that could not but
put him in mind of the Cross to which he was to be
nailed.</p>
            <p>II. What it is that makes Meditation of <hi>Christ</hi>'s Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
necessary, as an act of Preparation for this Holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
we shall easily know, if we consider,</p>

1. Meditation brings things to our Minds, we did
not think of before. Though we know before, that
Christ was unjustly accused by the Jews, beaten buffet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
crown'd with Thorns, inhumanly murther'd; yet
Meditation discovers things to us, we took no great no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of before, it helps us to enlarge upon the passages
of his Passion; and these cannot but be very instructive
to our Minds. This puts us in mind of the dignity of
the Person that suffer'd all this; how it was not a mere
Man, not a mortal King, not an Angel, not one of the
Higher Orders of Ministring Spirits, but the Son of
God that laid down his Life, a Life more precious than
the Lives of all created Beings put together. This puts
us in mind of the indignity of the Persons, for whom he
suffer'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what vile Creatures they were, Creatures of
whom he could expect no advantage, and fear no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and such as were his Enemies. This puts us in
mind of the vast multitude of his troubles and miseries,
how his Body did not only suffer, but his Soul too, how
he suffer'd in his Habit and Dress, by having it pull'd
off from him, and divided among the ruder Soldiers,
how he suffer'd in his Honour, and Reputation, by being

               </gap>ing
up of the People, and possess'd with a Devil; how he
suffer'd in his Wisdom, by being call'd Impostor, and
treated like a Fool, and Madman; how he suffer'd in
his Power, by being accus'd as a Magician, as one that
dealt with a Familiar, and was in league with the
Prince of Devils; how all sorts of Persons did contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
to his Suffering, a Disciple, whom he had nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish'd,
and brought up in the Nurture and Admonition
of the Lord, Kings, and Governors, Judges, Harlots,
Soldiers, High Priests, Scribes, Pharisees, Ecclesiasticks,
Seculars, Jews and Gentiles, Men and Women. This
puts us in mind, how every Member of his Body was
put to grievous pain; how his Head was crown'd with
Thorns; his Hair pluck'd off by the rude usage he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dur'd;
his Cheeks beaten; his Face sullied; his Back
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:103387:212"/>
crush'd; his Neck and Arms tied with Cords; his Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
bruis'd by the Cross; his Hands and Feet pierc'd
with Nails; his Side open'd with a Lance, and his whole
Body made black and blue with stripes: How all Senses
suffer'd, his Eyes seeing the Mockeries of the multitude;
his Ears hearing the Blasphemies of his Enemies; his
Smell forced to endure the stench of dead Bodies on
Mount <hi>Calvary;</hi> his Taste tormented with Thirst, and
what is worse, with Gall; and his feeling with variety
of blows. This puts us in mind, how his Soul endurd
more, far more yet, than his Senses, the Sins of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
lying like an heavy load upon her: This represents
how that was afflicted with a Sense of God's Anger a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
sin, and with the Damnation of thousands, that
would not prevent their ruine; and how, as the sins of
Mankind were without number, so his Grief and Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
was without measure. This puts us in mind, how
his Pain and Torments became more pungent, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictive,
by reason of the delicacy of his Complexion,
how his imagination being most lively, had therefore a
quicker sense of Misery, how his Torments were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any alloy, differing in this case from the Torments
of the Martyrs of old, who had great comfort admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred
to them in their Sufferings, Comforts so power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
that they walk'd on glowing Coals, as on a Bed
of Roses, and in the midst of Flames, had a cooling Dew
sprinkled upon them: This suggests how he drunk the
bitter Cup without mixture, without a drop of Honey
to sweeten it; and how this makes him the Martyr of
all Martyrs, and the King of all afflicted Saints; and
upon that account may be said to have endured more,
than all Men put together, ever suffer'd in this World.
This puts us in mind, with what affection he suffer'd,
how he chose to suffer, for the Joy and Comfort he should
thereby procure to all sincere Believers, how Love to
Mens Souls engaged him to these Sufferings; and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
a few drops of his Blood might have serv'd turn, to
redeem Mankind, he would, notwithstanding all this,
to testifie his infinite Love, shed every drop of Blood in
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:103387:213"/>
his Body for their sakes. This puts us in mind with
what fervency and earnestness he went to meet his Cross,
and in order thereunto bid the Traitor make haste, and
do quickly what he design'd to do, and with what ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity
he embrac'd his Torments; and therefore sung a
Hymn with his Disciples, before he was apprehended
by the Murtherers, to shew the joy he took in laying
down his Life for his Sheep. Meditation doth the Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters

            <p>2. Meditation of Christ's Passion enflames the Soul
with the Love of Jesus. At <hi>Patras,</hi> a
City of <hi>Achaia,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. Jean. Bapt. de St. Jure de la Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nois. &amp; de l'amour de nostre Seign. Liv. 1. Sect. 2.</note> there lived a Heathen
Priest, <hi>Coresus</hi> by name, who, intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Marry, set his Affections upon
one <hi>Callirrhoe,</hi> a Virgin of that Town,
whom he courted, and loved entirely,
but the more he courted her, the more refractory she
was, till she even abus'd him and reproach'd him, and
shut the door against him. The Priest, seeing no way
to compass his designs, consults his Oracle, and Idol,
but receives no answer. In the mean while, a killing
sickness seiz'd the Town, a Distemper which made Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
mad, and dye raving. The evil being become uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal,
and spreading daily more and more, some of the
chief Men of the Town, resolve to send an Embassie
to one of the Heathen Gods, in another City, which
gives them this Answer. That this Plague should not
cease, till one <hi>Callirrboe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> a Virgin in that Town, were
offer'd in Sacrifice, or some Person for her. The news
of the Oracle being noised about the Town, <hi>Callirrboe</hi>
goes to all her Friends, to see whether any would suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
for her, but finding none so fond, she prepares for

               </gap>th, and coming forth at the day appointed, dress'd
in her Funeral Robes, <hi>Coresus</hi> that was to be the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>er,
appears with his Sword to cut off her Head, for
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:103387:213"/>
it was his Office upon such dreadful Solemnities; but
as he is preparing to give the fatal blow, his Bowels be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to yearn; and to destroy a Person whom he had
loved with most cordial affection, was so severe a try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
to him, that rather than be guilty of so barbarous a
Fact, in the presence of the whole Assembly, he runs
the drawn Sword into his own Bowels; and as the
Blood was now issuing in Rivers from his Body, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses
to the Damfel that he dyed for her, so sincere,
so strong, so fervent was his Love. <hi>Callirrhoe</hi> astonish'd
at the sight, and confounded with the enterprize, her
stubborn Heart melts, and now would have saved his
Life with her own, but it was too late; yet to
make him amends, her Love to him on a sudden grows
so violent, that she resolv'd not to out-live him, and at
the same instant, made her Life a Sacrifice to bear him
company. <hi>Meditation</hi> of Christ's Passion produces, in
a manner, the same effect, for as it represents Christ's
dying for the stubborn sinner, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ying for love of
him, it raises reciprocal flames in the considerate Soul.
It puts the case, Suppose there should be a King most
Wise, most Rich, most Potent, most Beautiful, most
Gracious, in the very flower of his age, who being about
to Marry, should cast his Eyes and Love upon a poor
Country Maid, his Subject, and withal very much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
homely, ignorant, despised, and disregarded
by the meanest Men, adorned with no good Quality,
that should cause attraction, and solemnly Marry her,
<hi>What an obligation</hi> would that be to that poor infirm
Creature, advanced to a Throne from nothing, from
worse than nothing, to entertain that Royal Husband
with marvellous respect, and to behave her self in his
Presence with all possible Reverence, and Love, and
Modesty, considering what she hath been, and what
she is come to by his means? <hi>What an obligation</hi> to Treat
him with all Respect, Honour, and Humility? <hi>What an
obligation</hi> to love him with a most ardent, most tender,
and most affectionate Love, and to be most true and
faithful to him, loving none like him, who has deserv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:103387:214"/>
so much at her hands? <hi>What an obligation</hi> to commend and
praise him, and to express her Sense of his unspeakable
Favour to her? <hi>What an obligation,</hi> when he is sick, to
tend him, to be about his Bed, to declare her Sorrow,
and Grief, and Compassion by her Tears, especially
since he hath humbled himself beyond example to espouse
her? <hi>What an obligation,</hi> when he is absent, to speak of
him, to long for him, and to be impatient for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn?
<hi>What an obligation</hi> to sing his Virtues, his Conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scension,
his Mercy, and his Charity, and to magnifie
his Wisdom, his Goodness, his Beauty, and his Love to
her? <hi>What an obligation,</hi> to give him content in all things,
and to deport her self every where, so as to please him?
<hi>What an obligation,</hi> if she have committed the least of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
to think of it with great regret and remorse, to
beg his Pardon, and to implore his Mercy? <hi>What an
obligation</hi> to endure any thing, any trouble, any cross,
any inconvenience for his sake, and to think her self
happy, that she is in a capacity to suffer any thing for
his Name? <hi>What an obligation</hi> to be entirely subject to
him, and to yield to all things he desires of her? Finally,
<hi>What an obligation</hi> to think her self most happy in his
love, and to rejoyce in being thus advanced by him, to
a state she could never have wish'd, or hoped for? Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation
having put this case, applies it to the present
occasion, and saith, <hi>Thou, O my Soul, thou, art that poor,
despicable, contemptible Maid, that the Monarch of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse,
the Wisest, the most Potent, the greatest Prince in the
World, did fall in love with. There was no Beauty, no Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
no good Qualities, no Perfection, no Amiableness in
Thee, for which he should think of thee for his Spouse; and
that which surpasses all admiration, this Sovereign Prince,
this Prince of Princes, could not gain this wretched Maiden
but by enduring a Thousand Torments, by spilling of his Blood,
and hazarding his Life, and he freely and cheerfully Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
himself to obtain thy Love. He required no Dowry of
thee, for he was infinitely Rich, and thou miserably Poor. He
loved thee not in a foolish Passion, for he is infinitely Wise
He chose thee not for his Pleasure, for thou wert defiled to a
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:103387:214"/>
Prodigy, and himself is happy, and was happy in himself,
from all Eternity; nor did he Marry thee by force, for he is
Omnipotent; but it was mere Love, mere Charity, mere Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion,
that he set his Affections upon thee; and by his Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
thee, he hath ennobled thee, aggrandiz'd thy Fortune,
made thee Wise, and Rich, and Great, and Beautiful, and
hast not thou reason to love him with all thy heart, and with
all thy strength?</hi> And by such Meditations of <hi>Christ</hi>'s Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
the Soul is enflamed with the Love of the Lord
Jesus. Add to all this,</p>
            <p>3. What can be a more proper preparative for this
Sacrament, wherein the Passion and sufferings of our
Lord, are most solemnly remembred, than a previous
Meditation of his Sufferings; For hereby the Soul will
be more expedite in that remembrance, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
that Death, not only with greater facility, but with
greater Sense, and greater Affections too. It is so with
Men, that are to speak in Publick, they premeditate
what they are to say, and think much of the thing they
are to be upon, when they come before the Assembly;
and I see no reason, but this may be a good prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
for acting in publick too. Certainly, he that actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates
his Faculties thus in private, will be better able to
exercise them in publick; for hereby the Heart is sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son'd,
and when it appears before God in this Ordinance,
the sense, which the private Meditation hath lest upon
it, fits it the better for participation of <hi>Christ</hi>'s Merits.
This previous Meditation softens the Earth, makes it fit
for the Master's use, and for his sowing the good Seed
of Grace in it, when the Soul comes into the Courts of
the Lord. And as he, that means to Pray with good
attention, in publick, must not forget his secret Prayers
at home; so he that will reflect with comfort on his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's
Death at <hi>Church,</hi> must meditate of it in his <hi>Closet,</hi>
one helps the other; and if these go hand in hand to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
it is the way to put the Soul in an excellent
Frame. These private Meditations are the Dresses of
the Soul, she puts on at home, that she may look more
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:103387:215"/>
beautiful and amiable, when she comes to stand in her
bridegroom's Presence in the Temple.</p>
            <p>III. How this Meditation is to be order'd, and mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
must be in great measure lest to the Wisdom and
Discretion of the Party concern'd; yet I should think,
that the best way would be to lay the <hi>Holy Evangelists</hi>
before us, who all have given exact account of their
Master's Sufferings, especially in the last Scene of his
Life here on Earth, and to make Spiritual Reflections,
either on the whole History in general, or on some of
the principal Points contain'd in it. To give the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
an account of the Proposal, I will present him with
a Scheme of <hi>Meditations</hi> on the XXII and XXIII
<hi>Chapters</hi> of <hi>St. Lukes Gospel,</hi> which I do the rather pitch
upon, because, I think this Evangelist hath given us
the fullest account of the Circumstances and Particulars
of <hi>Christ</hi>'s last Sufferings; and I shall go from Verse to
Verse, not so much to prescribe mine own way, as to
give the devout Reader an hint, how he may improve
those Historical Passages, and enlarge upon them, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Gifts, parts and abilities, God hath given
him.</p>

Death, should yet be fond of their Prisons still, and

Want of Religion make Men! Nothing makes them act
more rationally, than Religion. Religion is the Image
of God; and he that practiseth it, cannot but be like
God. O my Jesus! Give me such a Sense of it, that it
may shine through my Actions, and People may see
whose Child I am. Oh, when shall my brutish, my

               <head>The Preceding Considerations reduced to Practice.</head>
               <p>I. HOw justly after this prospect, may God say,
<hi>What could have been done more to my Vineyard,
that I have not done in it? St. Bernard</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Serm. de di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligend. Deo.</note> hath
an Elegant Discourse upon this Subject, to
shew, what force the serious consideration
of Christ's Incarnation, and of what he hath done for
us, and particularly of his Sufferings and Death, hath,
to kindle the Fire of reciprocal Love in our Hearts.
God, being desirous, saith he, to restore Man, who
had lost himself, and to rescue him from the clutches of
the Devil, said within himself, If I should force this
wretched Creature against his Will and Choice, to the
Duties he is to discharge and perform, I should make a
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:103387:252"/>
Beast or an Ass of him, instead of a rational Man; nor
would he come to me voluntarily of his own accord,
and with a good Will; nor would he be able to say, <hi>I
will freely sacrifice unto thee;</hi> Therefore to make his coming
to me a matter of choice and rational freedom, I will ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie
and fright him, to see, whether that will drive him
to Repentance, and accordingly he threatened him with
misery, which no Mortal is able to express, with ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
Darkness, and a never dying Worm, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenchable
Fire. But stubborn Man nothing terrified
with all these Thunders, God was resolv'd to try what
Promises would do, and since naturally he is desirous of
Riches, and Honour, and Pleasures, and long Life; God
accordingly promis'd him infinite Treasures of Glory,
unexpressible Dignities in Heaven, and such Pleasures,
as the Heart of Man is not able to conceive, they are
so big, and large, and overflowing, and a life free, not
only from all evil, but from any end, or period, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding
with all manner of Felicities. But seeing that
even this would not prevail, there is but one thing more,
said he, that can be tryed. And seeing there is in Man,
not only a Fear and Desire, but a Principle of Love
too, than which nothing is stronger to draw and incline
his Will to Action: Accordingly he came himself and
appeared in Flesh, and carried himself so lovingly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the Sinner, and proceeded to so great an excess
of Charity, as to lay down his Life to save him. And
therefore, he that after this, continues hard and impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent,
<hi>saith the Father,</hi> will not turn to him, nor offer
his Heart, and Love to him, deserves most justly to hear
this unwelcome voice, <hi>O man, what could I have done
more for thee, to gain thy Love and affection, than I have
done?</hi> Indeed, what can we desire he should do more
for us? What can we desire more after his spilling his
Blood, and enduring for us more, than any Man ever
did? There is no greater Testimony of Love. If he
had had a better thing than his Blood, he would have
bestowed it upon us. But Love cannot go beyond this;
and therefore when <hi>Christ,</hi> just at the moment of his
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:103387:252"/>
Death, cry'd <hi>It is finished;</hi> We are not only to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
by that saying, That the Shadows of the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament,
the Desires of the Patriarchs, the Figures and
Prophecies, which went before of him, were at an end,
and accomplish'd, or that the malice of the Jews, the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the Devil, the captivity of Sin, and the reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation
of the World were finish'd, and consummate,
but the meaning withal is, that all the Arts, and Methods,
and Stratagems of Love, had now received their accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment,
and that beyond this, there was nothing
could be supposed capable to allure, or entice Men to
express their Love and Affection to their God, and that
beyond this he knew of nothing else that could draw,
or gain their Affection, than to be made Man, and to
die for them. And if God be come to the utmost bounds
of condescension in this attempt, and prevails not; judge,
O Sinner, judge, whether thou art not most deservedly
cast into Eternal Darkness.</p>
               <p>II. There is a great difference betwixt bare reading
of <hi>Christ</hi>'s Passion, and meditating of it. The former
makes little or no impression, the later touches and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects.
The former is no more, than looking on the Wine,
but the other is drinking of it. He that reads, may have his
Thoughts all that while in the <hi>Indies</hi> upon his Business, or
the affairs of his Calling; and when he comes from rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
may be able to give but a very small account of
his pains, except it be some general Notions, and an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect
draught, and that's no better, than taking up
water in a Sieve, which runs out, as fast as it is put in.
But Meditation fixes the Thoughts, and takes notice of
the weight and importance of the History. This ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amines
the end and designs of the various passages. This
takes a view of every circumstance, and finds, there are
greater Mysteries in the particulars, than at first sight
appear'd. This finds out new Mines, and makes that
shining Gold, which was but Oar before. I have heard
of some ill Men, that have been able to rehearse the
whole New Testament word for word; but he that
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:103387:253"/>
meditates but upon one Verse of the Book, shall receive
greater advantages by it, than the other by repetition
of the whole Bible. But all Persons have not Heads,
and Understandings, fitted for Meditation; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
those that have not, must either make some short
Remarks, or Reflections, upon what they read, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Directions and Method before laid down, or
make use of the Conceptions and Meditations of other
Men, which may possibly affect them, as much as
Thoughts of their own. However, by applying the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations
they read, and reading them attentively, they
make them their own; and though they sharpen their
Shears and Coulters, at other Men's Shops, yet that's no
hindrance to their Spiritual profit, and Edification; nay,
some are of that temper, that they like other Mens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templations
better than their own, partly out of a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
mistrust of their own Abilities, partly out of respect to
the Names and Persons of Learned and pious Men. But
what-ever Meditations are made use of in this Case, seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
must give them Life, and an intent to quicken our
Souls, and inward Man, must be the impulsive Cause;
and from hence the Thoughtful <hi>Christian</hi> may expect
very Blessed Effects and Consequences. Yet,</p>
               <p>III. When I urge this Meditating on <hi>Christ</hi>'s Death,
and Passion, by way of Preparation, and draw out this
Meditation to so great prolixity, for fear of being misun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood,
I must add these following Rules and Cautions.</p>
               <p>1. It is chiefly intended for such, as have time and
leisure, from whom God justly expects more, than of
those who are forced to employ their time early and
late in hard labour for a livelyhood; not but that the
way to Bliss is one, and both Rich and Poor must ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the same substantial Duties, upon which the future
Reward is promised, and both are obliged to be Just,
and Sober, and Temperate, and Meek, and Humble,
and Kind, and Tender-hearted, and lovers of God, and
devout; but as the Rich have more time and leisure, so
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:103387:253"/>
God expects they should exceed the other in Goodness,
and employ that time, which the other are forced to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow
in the sweat of their Face, upon Contemplations
of Nobler Objects, whereby they may become shining
and burning Lights; and, by their Example, supply the
use of Books to the poorer sort, who, in their Actions,
may compendiously view their own Duty, and be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
to follow their good example with Humility,
and Godly Fear.</p>
               <p>2. This prolix Meditation may lawfully be forborn,
upon urgent occasions, when a person either is to receive
the Holy Communion on his sick Bed, or is on a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain
call'd out to communicate with a Person, who is
sick. In these Cases, shorter Reflections and Ejacula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
coming from an Heart set and fix'd upon the
Love and Will of God, are acceptable; because, upon
such occasions, Christ's Rule holds; <hi>I will have Mercy
more than Sacrifice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. Nor is it necessary to tye our selves to the length
of it. As to this, we may use Liberty; and Discretion
must guide every Christian, who know best, what he is
able to bear, and what not. Sometimes only a few Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of the afore mentioned Chapters may be pitch'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for our Minds to expatiate upon, sometimes a greater
and larger Field may be set before us; and whereas,
from the variety of managing our Directions, being
sometimes short, sometimes prolix, this scruple is apt
to arise, that this is a sign of weariness, and inconstancy,
and unsteddiness in God's Service, that scruple must be
removed by consideration of <hi>Christ</hi>'s and the Apostles
example, the former praying sometime all night, and
sometime using only some few Ejaculations, to his Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Father; the other sometimes exercising themselves
in Devotion till Midnight, at other times working day
and night for the support of themselves, and Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions;
which we must suppose was not consisting with
great prolixity in set Meditations.</p>

               <head>The PRAYER.</head>
               <p>O My God, and Saviour! I am very sensible that I
have great Obligations to love thee, upon the account
of my Creation, Preservation, and daily Blessings, I receive
from thy liberal Hand! But that which even forces me,
works upon me powerfully, and, as it were, pushes me for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
and compels me to love thee, is the bitter Cup of thy
Sufferings, which for my sake thou didst drink off, and the
mighty work of Redemption, which renders thee altogether
lovely to my Soul! That admirable and incomparable Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
of thy Love, is a stronger attractive, makes a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
impulse, and it a sweeter, and a softer Cord to bind
any Heart to thy Service. To effect this Work, thou hast
taken more than ordinary pains! When thou didst first cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
me, it cost thee no more, than a Word speaking; but to
reinstate me in that Bliss, I had lost, and forfeited, thou
wast at the greatest expence and charge imaginable! Of the
Sovereign Lord of the World, thou becamest a Servant; of
Rich, extremely Poor; of the Eternal Word, a Man; and
of the Son of God, the Son of Man! so that though I was
made of nothing, yet I was not Redeem'd by nothing. Thou
spentest but Six days to Create, and frame the World; but
Three and thirty Years were spent to accomplish my Ransom,
and Restitution to God's Favour; and O what trouble,
what misery, was this thy Life fill'd withal! Thou didst
humble thy self to Flesh, to Death, to the Death of the Cross,
and, to effect this Glorious Work, wast content to be
clad in Flesh, to be punish'd with Death, and to be disgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
by the Cross for this miserable Worm! Thou didst do
much, and suffer much, that I might love thee much; and
because the Facility of my Creation did not move me much,
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:103387:254"/>
thou, therefore wast content to be at an excessive trouble in my
Redemption, thereby to charm my Soul the more, and to plant
in me greater Resentments of thy Charity! To this end thy
Side was opened with a Lance, that all Men might look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
thy Wounds, and into thy very Heart, and see how it bled
for Love! To this end thy Sacred Head did bend to the East
thy Feet were extended to the West, and thine Arms spread'
to the North and South, to let People in all parts of the
World see, how much thou lovedst them, and thereby to draw
their Hearts, and unite them to thy self for ever! O let not
mine be cold under this wonderful sight; and while I see
my God buffeted, my God crown'd with Thorns, my God
struck on the Face, and my God giving up the Ghost, let all
that is within me be touch'd, and quickned and enli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven'd,
and encouraged to cleave and to cling to thee for
ever. <hi>Amen, Amen.</hi>

            <argument>
               <head>The CONTENTS.</head>
               <p>A wonderful thing, that this Sacrament works no greater Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects!
One great Reason of it, Want of Self-Examination.
The Necessity of Self-Examination proved by three Reasons.
How it must be managed. The Rule of it, the Word of
God. A Catalogue of Sins and Duties. These to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered,
with respect to our Temper and Inclination. The
great Objection about the Intricacy, Difficulty and Tedious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of this Task, answered; and a Way laid down, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
it may be made facile, and easie, and delightful. Some
Rules to be observed in the Practice of this Self-Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that it may become effectual. The Errour of some
Churches in the Primitive Times, who gave this Sacrament
to Children and Infants. As soon as Persons are able to
examine themselves, they are bound to come to this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Another Man's examining of us is not enough, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Self-Examination. The Prayer.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>I. ONE of the most wonderful things in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
World, is, that such a <hi>Sacrament,</hi> as that
of the Eucharist, should be instituted by the Great Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
of Mankind: A Sacrament, wherein the most stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendous
Blessings are offered to Men; and that Men
should receive it so often, and no greater Effects should
appear upon their Lives and Tempers, after their Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation
of it: Which is as much as to say, that Fire
gives no Heat, and the Sun no Light, Health affords no
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:103387:255"/>
Cure, Abundance keeps Men poor, and the most whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
Meat produces no Nourishment. That which
makes the thing the more strange and astonishing, is
this, That God makes nothing, no, not the least Drop
of Rain, nor the least Grain of Sand, but for some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
End; and therefore must be supposed to have or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
this Sacrament for the most noble Ends imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
And if the Effects he designs by this Ordinance,
be such as our <hi>Liturgy</hi> tells us, <hi>For then we spiritually eat
the Flesh of Christ, and drink his Blood; then we dwell in
Christ, and Christ in us; we are one with Christ, and Christ
with us:</hi> If these be the designed and intended Effects
of this Ordinance, as certainly they are, it must be Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Astonishment to see so little of these Effects pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
in the many Communicants that appear at this
holy Table. And what can we ascribe these Defects to,
but to Men's Indisposition? In Natural Things, Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers
tell us, the Causes of Things, how excellent so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
are determined in their Effects, by the Disposition
of their Subjects: For which Reason we see, that the
Sun melts Wax, and hardens Clay; makes some things
pure and white, and others black; and the same Meat,
being eaten by different Persons, causes Health in one,
and Sickness in another. And, no doubt, the same Rule
will hold in Grace too; and therefore, that this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
works not those admirable Effects, intended by
Christ, in abundance of Persons, must be for want of a
suitable Preparation. Vessels hold more or less Water,
according to their Capacity; if the Vessel be little, it
will hold but little: And according to the Disposition of
our Souls, so we receive much, or less, or nothing at all,
in this Sacrament. And one of these excellent previous
Dispositions, is, Self-Examination, expresly enjoyn'd by
the Apostle, <hi>1 Cor. 11. 28. But let a Man examine himself,
and so let him eat of that Bread, and drink of that Cup.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>II. Though it be in a manner needless, after I have
laid down the Apostle's Command, to prove the Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
of this Self-Examination; yet, for a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uller Satisfaction
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:103387:256"/>
of the Reader, I shall enquire into the Reasons of the
Necessity; which are these following:</p>
            <p>1. <hi>All great Actions require Deliberation.</hi> This is a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xim,
all Mankind agrees in. 'Tis a common Principle:
And we count that Man a Fool, that attempts an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of great Concernment, without it: And <hi>Christ</hi>
himself hath taught us to do so, <hi>Luk. 14. 28, 29. For,
Which of you,</hi> saith he, <hi>intending to build a Tower, sits not
down first, and counts the Cost, whether he have sufficient to
finish it; lest happily, after he hath laid the Foundation, and is
not able to finish it, all that behold it begin to mock him, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
This Man began to build, and was not able to finish.</hi>
And if Deliberation be necessary before any great En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize,
Self-Examination must needs be so before Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
of the holy <hi>Eucharist:</hi> For, Who knows not,
that Receiving the holy Communion is one of the most
solemn, most weighty, and important Part of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion?
And if Deliberation be necessary, as a Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
Self-Examination must be so too; because Delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
cannot be duly performed without it: For, he
that deliberates before he comes to this Sacrament, must
necessarily consider the Majesty, Grandeur, and Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
Power, Splendour and Excellency of the Master
of the Feast; the Kindness, Mercy, Compassion, and
Excesses of Charity he expresses in it to miserable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
and whether himself hath those Qualifications,
Desires, Inclinations and Resolutions, which that mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent
Master of the Feast requires of the invited
Guests; and whether those Vertues, those Ornaments,
those Ingredients of true Repentance, that Hatred of
Sin, that Love to Goodness, which God expects of the
Persons that render themselves at his Table, be in him.
And what is this, but <hi>Self-Examination.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Want of Self-Examination is the Mother of Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.
He that doth not examine himself before he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
the holy Communion, (having never done it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
must necessarily continue a Stranger to himself.
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:103387:256"/>
Tis true, for ought he knows, he may receive as wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily
as the best: But, for ought he knows too, he may
eat and drink Judgment and Damnation to himself.
Want of Examination leaves the Soul blind, makes her
Understanding useless, and charges God with having
given the Man a Reflexive Power in vain. Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
must acquaint him with himself; and discover to
him, whether he have the Marks of a Penitent, the
Character of a Soul laden with a Sense of Sin, and
whether he be a fit Subject to receive Reconciliation;
whether his Errours be strong, or do abate; whether
he feels the Operation of God's Spirit upon his own,
whether the Things unseen make any Impression upon
his Soul, and whether he hath that Faith and Love,
which, in the Sight of God, is of great Price. To be
ignorant of all this, what is it, but to grope in the dark,
and, instead of coming like a Rational Creature to this
Ordinance, to approach with the Inclination of a Brute?
And though it is granted, that he who neglects this Self-Examination,
may understand the Design of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and the Mercies tender'd to the Soul, in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral;
yet still, without this Search, he cannot tell whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
those Mercies belong to him, whether he hath a
Share in them, or whether he may rationally expect
them at Christ's Hand. It is observed therefore, that
when Christ spoke of the Disciple that should betray
him, he doth not mention his Name; thereby to give
the Disciples Occasion to enquire whether they found
any Inclinations in themselves to so great a piece of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude.
So that Want of Self-Examination, as it
propagates Ignorance in the Soul, so it is to act directly
against the Design of the Gospel; which is, to <hi>fill us
with Spiritual Knowledge and Understanding,</hi> Col. 1. 9.
<hi>And to make us know the things which are freely given us of
God,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 12.</p>
            <p>3. All the Blessings of the Gospel are promised con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionally;
and consequently, the Blessings which are
the genuine Concomitants of this holy Sacrament. And
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:103387:257"/>
how shall any man take Comfort in these Blessings; if
he enquire not whether the Conditions, upon which
these Blessings are promised, be fulfilled in him; or
whether it be the Desire and Endeavour of his Soul to
fulfil them? If a Prince should set out a Proclamation,
that on such a Day he intends to bestow some Jewels of
great value on all Persons that have found any Secret of
Nature, which may be of publick Use; how ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
would that Man make himself, that should appear
among the Candidates, without enquiring whether he
was ever Master of an Invention, whereby the Publick
might be advanced. Those that enquire, and find up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Enquiry, that what they have done, is agreeable to
the Condition the Prince requires, may approach chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
and have their Expectation gratified. So it is
here; The Blessings promised in this Sacrament, are,
as I have often hinted in the preceding Discourse, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of Sins:</hi> But that is promised upon the Condition
of <hi>Turning from Darkness to Light,</hi> Act. 26. 18. <hi>Peace
with God:</hi> And that is promised upon the Condition of
<hi>a Lively Faith,</hi> which is active; as that of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s
was, <hi>Rom. 5. 1. A Right to the Everlasting Inheritance:</hi>
And that is promised upon Condition of <hi>Fighting the
good Fight,</hi> 2 Tim. 4. 7. <hi>Comfort in Tribulation:</hi> And
that is promised upon Condition of <hi>Trusting and relying
upon God,</hi> 2 Cor. 1. 9. <hi>The Assistance of God's Spirit:</hi>
And that is promised upon Condition of <hi>Walking as the
Children of God, and Willingness to be led and guided by
him,</hi> Rom. 8. 14. <hi>Union and Communion with Christ:</hi>
And that is promised upon the Condition of <hi>Walking in
the Light of Good Works,</hi> 1 Joh. 1. 7. <hi>Increase of Grace:</hi>
And that is promised upon Condition of <hi>an humble Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi>
Jam. 4. 6. <hi>Strength against our Corruptions:</hi> And
that is promised upon Condition of <hi>Putting on the whole
Armour of God,</hi> Ephes. 6. 10, 11. <hi>Assurance of God's
Love:</hi> And that is promised upon Condition of <hi>our sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
Love to Christ Jesus,</hi> Joh. 14. 21. That all these
Blessings are promised to us in this Sacrament, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
from hence, because Christ himself is promised to
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:103387:257"/>
be given into our Bosoms, and we cannot receive Christ
without his Benefits; and these Benefits are those I have
mentioned. But, since these Blessings are not to be had
without an hearty Consent and Agreement to those Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions;
and it is impossible to take Comfort in these
Blessings, except we know we have a Right to them;
and it is as impossible to know whether we have, or not;
without Self-Examination; it must necessarily follow,
that Self-Examination is a necessary Duty and Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
for this holy Sacrament.</p>
            <p>III. How this Self-Examination is to be managed, is
the next thing we must discourse of; and that which we
are to consider here, is, partly the <hi>Rule</hi> whereby this
Examination must be made, partly the <hi>Things</hi> that are to
be examined, and partly our <hi>Temper</hi> and <hi>Disposition</hi> with
respect to Things, about which Enquiry is made.</p>
            <p>1. The <hi>Rule;</hi> and that, without doubt, must be the
<hi>Law of God,</hi> as it is either contracted and reduced to a
few principal Heads in the <hi>Decalogue,</hi> and the <hi>Ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments;</hi>
or, as it is explained and spread into various
Branches in the Body of the Gospel; and particularly,
in <hi>Christ</hi>'s Sermon upon the Mount: And this Law, as
it is set forth and explained in the Gospel, is that which
we <hi>Christians</hi> are to stand and fall by. This Law, as it
is most suitable and agreeable to Reason, and intended
to perfect Humane Nature; so is it the standing Rule
of our Thoughts, Desires, Words and Actions, and of
our Behaviour and Deportment in our several Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and is called the <hi>Law of Faith, Rom. 3. 27. i. e.</hi> a
Summary of those Duties which a sound and serious Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
of another Life, and of the Promises and Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
of the Gospel, inforces and binds upon the Soul.
This Law, as it is given for the nonce, so Christ ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects,
his Followers should observe the Particulars of it;
and protests, that he will take none for his Friends, but
such as <hi>do whatsoever he commands them,</hi> Joh. 15. 14. and
compares all those to very <hi>foolish Men,</hi> and pursuing
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:103387:258"/>
their own Ruin, that <hi>hear these Sayings of his, and do them
not,</hi> Matth. 7. 26. And protests, that he will look upon
none <hi>as Sheep of his Flock, but those that hear and obey his
Voice,</hi> Joh. 10. 26, 27. And for the Performance of this
Law, he is ready to assist us with his Spirit, if we ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
seek it: And that we may not pretend Impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of keeping it, he allows of a sincere Repentance,
if, through Inadvertency, at any time we run counter
to any Particular of that Law; and promises to accept
of that Repentance, if it be not a Matter of Form, but
a serious Purpose to observe them better for the future.
And therefore,</p>
            <p>2. The Things that are to be insisted on in this Self-Examination,
are, partly the <hi>Sins</hi> and <hi>Breaches</hi> of this
Law we have been guilty of, and partly our <hi>Duties;</hi>
both which, because they lie dispersed, as I said, through
the whole Body of the Gospel, it will not be amiss, for
the Reader's Ease, to reduce to a certain Catalogue;
that, looking over the Catalogue, he may see, which of
these Sins he is, and hath been, prone to; and in what
Duties he hath been defective.</p>

            </list>
            <p>These are the Duties we find Commanded in the
Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by looking over
these two Catalogues, we may soon perceive, what we
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:103387:264"/>
have been doing against God, our Neighbor, and our
selves, and wherein we have been defective. But
then,</p>
            <p>3. This Self-Examination will not be compleat, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
we consider these Sins and Duties, with respect to
our present temper, and inclination. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</p>
            <p>1. As to the <hi>Sins,</hi> which upon a survey of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue,
we find our selves guilty of, or prone to, our hearts
must be ask'd whether we have an aversion from them,
whether we are resolved to shew our dislike and hatred
to them for the future, whether we do think it worth
our pains to exercise our selves in the mortification of
them, whether our real purpose is, whenever we are
tempted to any of them, to oppose the Temptation,
and to keep our selves unspotted from the insection,
whether the bent of our Soul is, wittingly and wilfully,
to allow our selves in the Commission of them no more,
whether we do in good earnest intend to enquire and
take advice, and to use the proper remedies to be rid of
them, whether we are resolv'd to shun the apparent oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions
of them, and whether, in case we do through
incogitancy run into any of these errors, to get up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
presently, and endeavour to bring our selves to an
habit of cautiousness of offending God, and whether
we will pray much, and work hard, to shake these Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
from our bosoms.</p>
            <p>2. As to the <hi>Duties,</hi> which, upon a view of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
list, we find we have neglected, enquiry must be
made, whether we see and taste the sweetness of them,
whether we do heartily believe, that the perfection of
our nature consists in them, whether we do earnestly
resolve, whatever comes of it, to be possessors of them
whether they ingross the desires of our hearts, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we have any ardent longings after these Spiritual
accomplishments, whether we prefer an holy fruitsul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:103387:265"/>
in these Virtues before Temporal felicities, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we have a sense of the great necessity, beauty,
and excellency of them, whether we do not content
our selves with bare wishes after them, but are fully
purposed to take the way, whereby we may obtain
them, whether we are resolved to improve the single
and accidental Acts, into a lasting habit and dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and whether we will be earnest with God for the
assistance of his holy Spirit, that they may take root in
us, and solicit the Grace of God to prosper our endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours;
whether we think them worth having, and will
act like persons, that do think so; whether if we have
done them imperfectly, the purpose of our Souls is
to perform them with greater sincerity; whether, if
foiled at any time in the pursuit of them, we mean to
take fresh courage, and to fall on again, till we arrive
to a facility in the practice, and if gentler means will
not prevail, whether we will use the severer, and more
rigorous ways of mortification, and offer even violence
to our desires, rather than go without them. If our
hearts can and dare answer in the affirmative, and say,
<hi>Yea,</hi> to these Queries, we are safe, and may believe,
God hath mighty blessings in store for us, and will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow
them upon us in the use of this Holy Sacrament.
In such a method, this Self-Examination must proceed,
and then it's like to produce the effects, we desire, and
God expects at our hands.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>IV. But still you will say,</hi> That is a very operose and
laborious Business, and full of intricacies and difficulties,
and scarce possible to be done, every time a Person receives
the Holy Communion; especially, if accidentally a Christian
is to Communicate with a sick, or dying Neighbour; nor
can Ministers themselves be supposed capable of doing all
this, when they are on a sudden call'd upon, to admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
the Holy Sacrament to persons, that send for them.
<hi>But to give a satisfactory Answer to this point, it will
be necessary to lay down the reply in these following
Positions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="517" facs="tcp:103387:265"/>
1. The Trouble is imagined to be greater than really
it is. If People are unwilling, it is an easie matter to
pretend Difficulties and Impossibilities. All that I have
mentioned, may be done in an Hour's time, or less:
For it is to be supposed, that every Person is not guilty
of all the Sins, nor guilty of the Neglect of all the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
in the preceeding <hi>Lists:</hi> And how easily may a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
spy those Sins and Neglects he is prone to; and
then, by the Rule of Queries, mentioned before, see
how his Heart stands affected! But, suppose it were a
Task of some difficulty, Is Heaven worth nothing? And
is the Labour for the Body of that Consequence, that
the Soul deserves to be neglected? What if God would
not part with an Interest in his Love upon cheaper
Terms? Will ye refuse it, and chuse to be miserable?
Sure, you would not think so, if you had been but one
Moment in Hell. However, as I said, the Task is not
so laborious, as is imagined by Persons who have an
Aversion from Goodness.</p>
            <p>2. It is confessed, that the Command about Self-Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
is general, and concerns both the Good and
Bad, both Worthy and Unworthy Receivers; both
those who are void of Grace, and those that are filled
with the Spirit. But, though the Command is general,
and obliges the Serious, as well as the Profane; the
Compleat, as well as the Half-Christian, equally; yet,
in the manner of the Performance of it, there cannot
but be a very great difference, because the Persons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
do differ much in their Tempers, Progress in
Goodness, and in their Wants and Necessities; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently,
to the one it must be more laborious, than
to the other; and the one hath reason to spend more
Time in this Self-Examination, than the other; as he
who hath suffered his House to become very full of Filth
and Dirt, must be at greater Cost and Pains to cleanse
it, than he that every Day takes care to keep it swept.
And therefore,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="518" facs="tcp:103387:266"/>
3. A Man who hath led an ill Life, and thinks of
coming to the Table of his Lord and Master; or if he
have communicated formerly, and, after that, is fallen
into any grosser Sin, and gone on in it, when-ever he
approaches, had need set all the particular Sins God
hath forbid in his Gospel, and all the particular Duties
commanded in that Book, before him, and ransack all
the Actions of his Life, he can remember; to see how
far he hath been from the Kingdom of God, and how
his Heart is now resolved, and disposed: As to his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Sins, and Neglects; whether he intends to take
up, and to set his Face against them; and whether it
be his unfeigned Desire, Purpose, and deliberate Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
to submit his Neck to the sweet and easie Yoke
of <hi>Christ;</hi> of whom he expects Pardon and Salvation,
both in this Sacrament, and in the last Day. And as
tedious as this Self-Examination may appear to such a
Person, yet he may thank himself, that his long Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance
and Boldness in a sinful Life hath made the Task
so laborious to him. And, indeed, till such a Man's
Love to Sin, and a sinful Life, doth signally abate, and
the Byass of his Soul be changed, and turned, it will be
necessary for him, for some time at least, as often as he
receives the holy Sacrament, to iterate and repeat this
larger Self-Examination, to see what Advance he makes
in Holiness; and whether there be not some Sins lurk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in his Breast, he took no notice of before. But
then,</p>
            <p>4. If he find that, after Receiving several times, his
Faith, and Love to the Lord <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> doth signally
grow, and his Relish of a sinful Life dies, and a nobler
Taste of the Goodness of God insinuates into his Breast,
as his Sins grow fewer, so his Self-Examination before
the holy Sacrament need not be so laborious, as before
it was. Finding he hath gotten a setled Hatred and
Abhorrency of several Sins he formerly delighted in, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of examining himself about them, he hath reason
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:103387:266"/>
to break forth into Praises and Admiration of the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of God, who hath delivered him from the Power
of Darkness, and led him to his Marvellous Light. In
a Word, The holier, the more melting towards God
and Goodness, the more spiritual, the more obedient
to the Commands of the Gospel, a Man or Woman
grows, the less Self-Examination will serve turn; for,
as he grows in Grace, so his Errours and Infirmities
abate; and those which remain against his Will, may be
easily known, and he may easily take a View of them;
nor will it cost him so much Time to take them into
Consideration, as the greater Heap of them formerly
did; and let him separate those Sins he hath left, and
got the Mastery and Conquest of, from those Infirmities
which yet, against his Desire or Approbation, cleave
to him, and the Remainder will soon be examined, and
he may soon satisfie himself, whether he be resolved to
labour more and more to exterminate them from his
Soul; and upon that Account come to the holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to get greater Strength and Courage against
them, by contemplating the Love of God, and the
Cross, the Agonies, and the Tremblings the Lord <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi>
endured for them. The Sins a Man hath actually
left, need not be examined over again, every time he
Receives; but those only he is yet very prone to slip
into, and would fain be rid of, to become more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable
to the Lord <hi>Jesus.</hi> So that,</p>
            <p>5. He that makes it the Business of his Life to please
God in all Places, and in all the Conditions and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
of his Life, and is arrived to a Cordial and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical
Love of Goodness, may very Conscientiously, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a very small Examination of his Life and Actions,
especially if he be straitned in Time, come to the holy
Communion; for the Sins he would fain be rid of, he
may soon run over, and see whether he goes to this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ordinance with a Design to become more spiritual,
and take a final Leave of his Sins at the awful Sight of
the Cross of Christ. And for this Reason, not only a
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:103387:267"/>
serious Minister of the Gospel, who endeavours to lead a
very Exemplary Life, and to practise what he preaches;
but even a Conscientious Lay-man, who carries about
him a constant Zeal and Desire to advance the Glory
of God, and his Everlasting Salvation, may, upon a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
short Examination, receive this holy Sacrament, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with a sick Friend, or dying Neighbour, and upon
a very short Warning too; though at other Times,
when he hath more Time, it will be necessary and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
to enlarge his Self-Examination and Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
thereby to give greater Life to his Faith, and
Hope, and Love, and Charity.</p>
            <p>6. A Christian may very much save himself the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
of a tedious Self-Examination before he comes to
the holy Sacrament, by a daily Self-Examination. And
he that every Night surveys the Actions, and Discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
and Desires of that Day, and sets his Accounts even
with God, and searches what Temptations have assaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
him that Day, and how he hath resisted them;
how he hath spent his Time, and what good Thoughts
he hath entertained, what Good he hath done; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he hath watched, and been Conscientious in the
Discharge of his Duty, will by this Means come to a
true Knowledge of himself; and by breaking the Task
thus by little and little, a very short Self-Examination
will be requisite when he is to come to this Ordinance.
This daily Self-Examination brings him to a Sense of the
Corruptions which do most easily beset him, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he comes to know what it is he must bend his chief
Forces against, and therefore hath not much to do when
he comes to the Supper of the Lord.</p>
            <p>7. Self-Examination being properly a Labour of the
Mind, I do not doubt, but a poor Day-Labourer, or a
Servant, or any Man that is obliged to get a Livelihood
for himself and Family by working hard, may, in the
midst of his lawful Employment, while he sits or walks
in his Shop, or is busie with his Hands, apply his Mind
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:103387:267"/>
to a Survey of his Sins, and Errours, and Defects; and
examine himself about his Repentance, whether it be
sincere, or not; and about the Particulars of his former
Life, and whether he be sincerely resolved for Spiritual
Wisdom, and a Spiritual Mind, and examine himself
very acceptably: For it is a great Mistake, that this Self-Examination
cannot be performed, but in a Chamber
or Closet, and by spending so many Hours in the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise.
It may be performed as we are walking, as we
are about our Work; in the Field, as well as at home;
at the Plough, as well as in a Study: Though I still
urge, that where God hath given a Person a quiet, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date
and easie Life, free from the Incumbrances of the
World, there he justly expects that Men should take
different Measures in this Self-Examination. A Man,
in Case of Necessity, can live upon Bread and Water,
and think it to be very good Fare; but being in his
House, and all Conveniencies about him, he gratifies
his Appetite with greater Variety: And that shews the
difference betwixt Labouring People, and those that can
take their Ease at home. 'Tis very pleasing to God, to
see the poor Man take pains with himself in this Self-Examination,
even in his busie Hours, and toyling Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment:
But of the other, who are not necessitated
to lead such a Life, he expects they should perform the
Task suitably to their Leisure, and Time, and quiet
Hours; and thereby express in some measure their Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
to God, who hath made this difference between
them and the meaner sort. Yet,</p>
            <p>8. Though I have told you, that the Sins we have left
and forsaken, need not be repeated over again every
time we receive the Sacrament; yet it is of very great
Use in our private Fasts and Humiliation-days, to take
every one of those Sins we have abandoned, and shaken
hands with, into fresh Consideration; thereby to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
our selves to a greater Admiration of the Mercy of
God, who hath freed us from those Shackles; and of
his Patience, that did not cut us off in the midst of those
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:103387:268"/>
Sins we formerly doated on, but hath spared us, and so
ordered things, that we should come to a Sense of our
Danger; and vouchsafed unto us Means and Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities,
whereby we might escape the Pollutions we once
wallowed in. So Men who have been delivered from run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
in the Night upon a Precipice, visit the fatal place
sometimes, to see what a Concatenation of Mischiefs they
have been preserved from by an Almighty Providence;
and thereby supply themselves with new Arguments,
both to magnifie the unspeakable Protection, and to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
and enlarge their Gratitude, and to testifie their
Sense of the Mercy, by charitable Actions, and warmer
Devotions for the future.</p>
            <p>V. But because Errours may be committed in this
Self-Examination, as to the manner of the Performance,
it will be very expedient, in the last place, to give some
Rules, how this Self-Examination ought to be qualified.</p>
            <p>1. It must be an impartial, no flattering Self-Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.
As there is nothing more common to Men,
than to run into one Extream or other, so it happens
very often in the Duty before us. Some examine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
so strictly, that they even confound themselves,
and run upon the very Brink of Despair. Others do it
with that foolish Tenderness to their Lusts, that they
make the Colours too fine, in which they are to draw
themselves: Whence it comes to pass, that when they
have done sitting, the Picture looks mighty well, but is
not to the Life; and as themselves were the Painters, so
it is too evident, that they favoured themselves too much
in the Drawing. To take either the little Resemblan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Vertues we find in our selves, for real Vertues;
or to satisfie our selves, that the faint Inclinations we
have to practise the substantial Duties, are unfeigned and
strong Purposes, must necessarily prove deceitful Work.
Our Business here must be, not to skin the Wound, but
to heal it; and therefore, where we are apt to think
too well of our selves, it would not be amiss to ask either
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:103387:268"/>
Divines, or Persons we are familiar withal, what they
think of our Religion; and that Question our <hi>Saviour</hi>
doth ask his Disciples, <hi>Matth. 16. 13. Whom say Men,
that I am?</hi> may not be improper to be put to our Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance,
What Men abroad do think of us? And
though the Censures of Men, if apparently vain and
groundless, ought to be slighted; yet from the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
that other Men give of us, much may be lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
sometimes: And if they count us proud, or cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorious,
or bitter, or sensual, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it may serve as a
Motive to enquire what there is in us, that may give
Occasion to others to think of us as they do; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we do not give them too much Ground for those
Censures.</p>
            <p>2. This Self-Examination must ever have a truly spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
End; and that End must be, to wash our selves,
that we may be clean. If it be only to favour a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Damp upon our Spirits, or to satisfie the Terrours
of an unquiet Conscience, or to comply with the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom
and Formality of Preparation, the Self-Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
will lose its Virtue and Sweetness: The End must
determine its Acceptableness, Soundness, and Sinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
And he that examines himself, without Reserves,
out of a Christian Simplicity, and with an Intent to
become more like God, and more like that Saviour,
whose Death is remembred in this <hi>Eucharist;</hi> and more

And he that hath Courage to tell his God,</hi> Lord, thou
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:103387:269"/>
knowest my Heart, and triest my Reins; and thy piercing
Eye is a Discerner of the Thoughts and Intentions of my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Man. Thou knowest, I do not wilfully hide any thing
from my self; and I am so far from harbouring any secret
Lust, or Vanity, or Corruption, that it is the ardent Desire
of my Soul, that thou wouldst discover to me what Impurity,
what Errour, what Fault lies lurking in my Breast. I am
not afraid, blessed be thy Name, to know the worst of my
self. Let down, I pray thee, some of thy gracious Beams in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
my Heart, whereby I may see the Defects which, by reason
of my Blindness, I cannot as yet discover; whatever it be,
O Lord; though it be incorporated with my Profit or Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
or with my very Heart, I am resolved to tear it from
my Soul. Let me but see it; and, with that Sight, give
me Strength, and Spiritual Courage, and it shall not stay in
that House which thou hast pleased to chuse for thy Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.
<hi>He that thus dares address himself to God in
his Self-Examination, discovers the Sincerity of his
Soul.</hi>

               <head>The preceding Considerations reduced to Practice.</head>
               <p>I IF it be necessary to examine our selves before we
eat and drink in this holy Sacrament, then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
the Churches heretofore were in an Errour, that

in St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s Time: <hi>Innocent</hi> I. Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi>
established it. It continued down to St. <hi>Austin</hi>'s Days;
and the Custom was, as soon as the Children were ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized,
to give them the holy Communion. Under
<hi>Charles the Great,</hi> about the Year 800. after <hi>Christ,</hi> they
did not only admit Infants to Communicate in the

sick, or a Child should be taken ill suddenly, they might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
and not die without the Communion.</hi> Among the
<hi>Aethiopian Christians,</hi> the Custom continues at this Day;
and they give the Sacrament to Infants, as soon as they
are baptized. The <hi>Christians</hi> in <hi>Moscovy</hi> give it to Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of Seven Years of Age, because they think, that
about that time Children begin to commit Actual Sins.
And <hi>Hospinian</hi> tells us of a Custom in
<hi>Lorrain,</hi>

                     <hi>Hospin.</hi> Hist. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cram.
lib. 2. cap. 2.</note> which continued yet in the
last Century, amongst some <hi>Papists,</hi> as
a Relick of that ancient Practice of Communicating
Infants. The Priest, when he had baptized the Infant,
would fetch from the Altar a Consecrated Wafer, and,
having taken it betwixt his two Fingers, shew it to the
People; when he had done, put it up again in the
Box, and then wash his two Fingers with Wine, and
put some Drops of that Wine in the Infant's Mouth.
But, as ancient, and as common as this Custom was,
to give Infants the holy Communion; yet the Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> it self was at last ashamed of it, and abolished
it by a <hi>Canon</hi> in the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Conc. <hi>Trid.</hi> Sess. 5. cap. 4.</note>
That which moved some of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Churches to begin this Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom,
was, that Saying of Christ, <hi>Joh. 6. 53. Except
ye eat the Flesh of the Son of Man, and drink his Blood, ye
have no Life in you.</hi> This made them think it absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
necessary to Salvation; and, that Children dying in
their Infancy, might not perish, they gave them the
Sacrament. But their Mistake lay here, That they took
the Spiritual Eating of Christ's Flesh, and Drinking his
Blood, by a lively Faith, spoken of in that Chapter,
for Sacramental Eating and Drinking, or Eating and
Drinking in the holy Sacrament. 'Tis evident, that
<hi>Christ</hi> instituted this Sacrament, with an Intent, we
should use it in remembrance of him; which Children
are not capable of, much less of Self-Examination: And
therefore, even under the Law, though Infants were
circumcised, yet they were not admitted to eat of the
Passover, till they came to the Use of their Reason.
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:103387:270"/>
Not to mention, that this Sacrament being designed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
for Reformation of our Lives, which Infants have no
Occasion for, at least, no Sense of, during that State of
Innocence; they can receive no prejudice by not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
the holy Communion, seeing there is not that
Necessity for it in them, in point of Amendment of Life,
that there is in the Adult.</p>
               <p>II. Yet, from the Necessity of Self-Examination be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this Sacrament, we may very rationally infer, that
as soon as young People are able to examine themselves,
they ought to come to the holy Communion. There
is an Emphasis in the Apostle's Words, mentioned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
<hi>But let a Man examine himself, and so let him eat
and drink:</hi> Which imports, not only that a Person who
hath examined himself, may come; but withal, that
when he is capable of examining himself, he ought to
do it, and so come to this holy Ordinance. I reckon,
that as soon as young Men and Women are able to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
what Sin, and what Holiness is, what the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of <hi>Christ</hi>'s Death is, and what Heaven and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
means, they are capable also of Self-Examination;
and consequently, of coming to the holy Communion:
And if the Creator be fit to be remembred in the Days
of our Youth, the Redeemer of Men can be no impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Object of that Remembrance. It must be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
indeed, that the Word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, used by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle,
in the Precept of <hi>Self-Examination,</hi> is taken from
Metallaries, and Lapidists, or Jewellers, that make a
very strict Examination, whether the Precious Stone be
truly Oriental, or no; and whether there be no Flaw
in it: And though it (being a Word of such Import)
implies a very accurate Search into our Ways, and nice
Care to be found worthy; which Young Men of Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen,
or Fifteen, or Sixteen, may be supposed, not so
very capable of performing; yet they are able to discern
such Sins as they find forbidden in their Catechism, and
have been taught to avoid by their Parents, from whom
they have learned their Duty to God and Man. And,
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:103387:270"/>
as the Sins of that early Age cannot be supposed to be
very numerous, and a great many of those they have
been guilty of before that Age, were committed out
of Ignorance, so the Examination is more easily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed;
and as their Age and Religion advances, so
they will know more. Their early Self-Examination
makes way for early Gravity, and helps to ripen their
Understandings, and is the only Way to prevent their
falling into the Vices of the Age; and if any thing, next
to the Grace of God, can be a Charm against Infection
from a debauch'd and irreligious World, this is most
likely to be it; I mean, this Self-Examination, joyned
with the holy Sacrament, for which it is intended, as a
proper Preparative.</p>
               <p>III. It is not enough, that another Person hath exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
us, or doth examine us; but we our selves must
take pains in it. Ministers, and Parents, and Friends,
by examining of us, may be able to give us very good
Directions, and excellent Instructions, how we are to
order our Conversation; but to all this must be added
our own Labour and Diligence, to see whether we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
those Directions, whether they are acceptable to
us, how we relish them, and whether we intend to act
accordingly. Up then, Christian, and try thy Ways:
Be not afraid of Labour. <hi>Labour and Food,</hi> saith <hi>Philo,
have the same Vertue; for, as upon Food a Man's whole Life
depends, so upon Labour also depends all that a Man can call
good. Therefore, as they that will prolong Life, do not neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
their Food; so he that desires any real or solid Good,
must not be afraid of Labour.</hi> As Meat is very trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
and burthensome to a weak Stomach, that hath
but little Natural Heat; so to him that hath but little
Love to Christ, this Labour of Self-Examination will be
burthensome. But, Christian, as thou hast the greatest
reason to love the Lord <hi>Jesus;</hi> so, if thou lovest him to
any purpose, both this and other Labours will appear ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
easie; for Love will make them so. See therefore,
and enquire, how Concerns stand betwixt God and
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:103387:271"/>
thine own Soul. Shall thy Reason lie useless? Shall that
excellent Faculty be employed in searching into the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
of thy Shop, and not into the State of thy bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Part? Is it not worth knowing whether thou art of
God, or a Child of the Devil? And whether thou hadst
rather grovel in the Dust, like a Muck-worm, or ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
thy thy Soul, and fix it upon Objects, which An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
desire to pry into? Hath God given thee Power to
examine thy self, and wilt thou neglect that Power?
Though thou canst not Read nor Write, yet thou canst
think, and think whether thy Life be according to the
Holy Rules, which are observed by other conscientious
Christians. Through this examination thou mayst come
to see, what God hath done for thy Soul; and if he
hath planted there an abhorrency of that which is evil,
and a strong affection to that which is good, how joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
mayst thou come to this Holy Table, and expect,
that God <hi>will pour Water upon him, that is Thirsty, and
Floods upon the dry Ground, and that thou shalt spring up, as
among the Grass, and as the Willows by the Water-courses,</hi>
Isai. 44. 3. 3. He that comes to be acquainted with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
at the same time comes to be acquainted with God
the Father, and his Son Jesus Christ. This is true Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy;
and as he is the greatest Politician in Temporals,
that sees afar off, and considers the events of things, and
upon what causes they depend, and gives counsel ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly;
so he is the greast Politician in Spirituals,
that studies himself, acquaints himself with his own heart;
for such a person looks further than his present profit,
and, sensible how this self-acquaintance will be valued
one day, counsels himself to be expert in that Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
For it is certain, that in the last day not the
great Scholarship of Men, not their improving of Arts
and Sciences, not their skill in various Languages, not
their Ability to Discourse well, not their volubility of
Tongue, not their Rhetorical and Eloquent Speaking,
not their profound Philosophy, nor their Diving into
the secrets of Nature will be much admired. These
things did well for this World, and might be service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:103387:271"/>
to various Sorts and Degrees of Men: But if Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
with all these Accomplishments about them, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look'd
their own Hearts, cherished Weeds and Vices
there, and would take no notice of them, their Parts
and Learning will not stand them in great stead in that
Day of Retribution. The poor Christian that ransack'd
his Soul often, turned over the Leaves of his Conscience,
that spiritual Book, on purpose to see his own Spots and
Stains, and wash himself clean, out of an holy Emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Purity of the Lord Jesus, he will be counted
at last the most prudent Man, that had the quickest Eye,
and a Sight sharper than an Eagle; for, as this gives
him a Title to all that Christ hath purchased, and the
rich Blessings laid up for him in this holy Sacrament;
so, in the last Day, it gives him full Possession of all the
Trophies of Christ's Victory.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>O</hi> God! Thou seest the secret Recesses of my Soul! Though
I may hide my self from my self, yet I cannot hide my
self from thee, whose Sight is not darkned by the Night, nor
stopped by an Object intervening, nor hindred by Walls of
Brass, nor weaken'd with the greatness of the Distance. O
Lord! Thou hast commanded me to examine my self, and to
search into the Sins and Errours of my Life! What Foes I
have, and how many there be that rise against me, that would
swallow up my Soul, and devour it; that I may secure my
self against their Rage, by taking Sanctuary at the Death of
my ever blessed Redeemer, the Lord Jesus! O Lord, I am
very apt to do thy Work negligently; I am apt to do it by
halves, and superficially, and without any regard to its weight
and moment! Thou that knowest my Dulness, my Backward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and my Hypocrisie, deliver me, I beseech thee, from my
self; and make me Partaker of that Light, whereby thou
meanest to discover the Sins of Men in the last Day, when
they come to appear before thy Tribunal. By that Light they
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:103387:272"/>
will see every Deformity, every Enormity, every Exorbitance
of their Outward and Inward Man. That will discover to
them, what they have long ago forgotten; and manifest to
them, what, for many Years, they have not thought of. That
will shew them every Errour of their Lives, to their Confusion
and Amazement. That will make them see their Faults so
evidently, and so distinctly, that they will not be able to deny
them, but be forced to render themselves Prisoners to thy Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice.
That will undeceive them in their fond Opinions of
their Sins, and pull away the Varnish they have put upon
them, and make them appear in their native Hue and Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
Oh, vouchsafe me that Light in some measure now,
that I may not deceive mine own Soul: Make me Partaker,
withal, of the Zeal of thy Justice, and of that Hatred thou
bearest against Sin, that I may hate my Sins, as thou dost
hate them. I desire to do all things in thy Name, and by thy
Assistance. I would willingly come to that Sincerity thou so
much delightest in. Oh! Guide my Steps; and if I take
false Measures, put me in the right Way again. Oh! Let
me not swerve from thy Commandments. Let my Confusion
be continually before me, that I may humble my self under thy
mighty Hand, and may be exalted in due time, through Jesus
Christ our Lord. <hi>Amen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <head type="sub">Of judging our selves, the Third Preparative
Duty, in order to our worthy Receiving of
the Blessed Sacrament.</head>
            <argument>
               <head>The CONTENTS.</head>
               <p>Judging our selves, contains three Acts; Confession of
Sin, Self-Condemnation, and inflicting Judgments on
our Selves. The Nature of these Acts explained. This
judging our selves, proved to be pleasing to God. What
it is that makes it so. Confession of Sins, if rightly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
is a great Work. Men are loth to confess those
Sins, which they are loth to leave. Carnal Men wonder
at the great stir, that some Penitents make. In inflicting
Judgments on our selves, the Word of God must be made
our Rule. The Prayer.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>I. I Mention this Judging of our selves, as a Duty
preparatory for the Holy Sacrament, because it is
certain, that <hi>St. Paul</hi> makes it so. <hi>1 Cor. 11. 31. If we
would judge our selves, we should not be judged.</hi> God's
judging of us, or proceeding to Judgment against us,
hath in all Ages appeared very terrible to good Men,
because it speaks his Anger, and it <hi>is a fearful thing to
fall into the hands of the living God.</hi> Heb. 10. 31. And
therefore <hi>David</hi> doth so often deprecate God's Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
particularly, <hi>Psal. 143. 2. Enter not into Judgment
with thy servant, for in thy sight no man living shall be justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:</hi>
And <hi>Psal. 119. 120. My flesh trembles for fear of thee,
and I am afraid of thy Judgments.</hi> And, <hi>Psal. 66. 3. How
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:103387:273"/>
terrible art thou in thy Works,</hi> or Judgments! And though,
<hi>Psal. 26. 1.</hi> he prays, <hi>Judge me, O God;</hi> yet, by that, he
means no more, than that God would plead his Cause,
and vindicate his Innocence, which was abused, bespat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd,
and oppress'd, by his Enemies. God's judging
of us, differs very much from judging our selves; and
when we are exhorted to judge our selves, it is not to
oblige us, to beg of God to send Judgments upon us;
but it is to do something, whereby the Judgment of God,
we have deserved, may be prevented and averted; and
upon attending to the scope and drift of the <hi>Apostle</hi> in
that Advice, we shall find, that it consists, partly in <hi>accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
our selves,</hi> and <hi>confessing our faults,</hi> partly in <hi>condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our selves</hi> for <hi>the faults we have committed,</hi> and partly
in <hi>exercising acts of Justice, and executing Judgment upon
our selves,</hi> of which we are to speak in order.</p>
            <p>II. <hi>The First Act</hi> of <hi>judging our selves,</hi> is, <hi>confessing our
Sins,</hi> and <hi>accusing our selves,</hi> and Act very proper after
Self-Examination; confessing, I mean, such Sins, as, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
strict examination, we find our selves to have been
guilty of, without being afraid of giving our selves
Names too harsh, and too reproachful. It's true, no
Man is obliged to accuse himself of Sins he was never
guilty of; and to charge our selves with the guilt of
Fornication, or Adultery, or Murther, or Blasphemy,
or Theft, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which, through the restraining Grace of
God, we never thought of, and have been strangers to,
is, to tell God a lye, except we understand those Sins in
a Spiritual Sense; and, in this case, a Man or Woman
may say, they have been guilty of Adultery, by depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
wickedly from their God, whom they were so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly
Marry'd, and joyn'd to, in Baptism, and the
Supper of the Lord, and by doting upon a miserable
transitory World, which <hi>St. James</hi> calls <hi>Spiritual Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
Jam. 4. 4.</hi> And, upon this account, a Man may
say, he hath been guilty of Blasphemy, in dishonouring
the Gospel by his vain and wicked Life, whereby he
he hath given occasion to the Enemies of the Lord to
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:103387:273"/>
blaspheme him, and speak evil of Religion; and, after
the same manner, he may justly accuse himself of Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
if he have often stabb'd his Neighbour's Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
by Slanders, Reproaches, and evil surmises
against him, and disparaging of him to those, from whom
he expected signal kindnesses: But, set aside this Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Sense, a Man is not obliged by any Law of God, to
confess, that he hath been formally guilty of sins he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
committed to his best remembrance; but in those
he hath actually run into, either wilfully, or by surprize,
he ought to be his own severe accuser, especially to God,
whom he hath thereby grievously offended; and he
truly judges himself, that, upon a deep search of his Heart,
finding what Precepts of the Gospel he hath wittingly
acted against, cries out, <hi>Lord! I have been that rotten
Sheep of thy Flock, which, by my ill example, hath infected
other! I have been that Viper thou hast put into thy Bosom,
and which hath threatned death to those Bowels that gave it
life; and been a Rebel, by my monstrous ingratitude, to my
Father which is in Heaven! I have been that Prodigal, that
hath run away from his Father's House, and travell'd into a
far Country, as far as Hell it self! I have been that Fool, that
mad Man, that hath said to his Soul, Thou hast Goods laid
up for many years, eat and drink, and be merry! I have been
that Satan, that Adversary, that have savoured the things
that be of Men, more than the things which be of God! I
have been that bewitch'd Creature, that have begun in the
Spirit, and thought to end in the Flesh! I have been that</hi> Judas,
<hi>that have betray'd the Son of Man with a kiss! I have been
that brutish Man, that, by my careless life, have as good as
said, The Lord sees not, neither will the God of</hi> Jacob <hi>regard
is! O that I had Wings like a Dove, for then would I fly
away, and bewail my folly in some Wilderness!</hi> But in
this Confession, or Self-accusation, some necessary Rules
must be observed.</p>
            <p>1. A Man must not content himself with general Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions,
but, in the Accusation, descend to particular
Errors and Neglects of his Life. General Confessions
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:103387:274"/>
do well in Publick <hi>Liturgies,</hi> and <hi>Offices of the Church,</hi> in
which a whole Congregation is to joyn; but in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate,
the case very much alters. The Church, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the old saying, <hi>non junicat de occultis,</hi> judges not
of secret things, and knows not what particular Sins eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Man is guilty of, and one may have stain'd his Soul
with certain Sins, which another hath not; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ore,
wisely prescribes only general acknowledgments
of Offences, that the whole Assembly may comply with
the Duty; but in private every Man knows, or may
know, where the Shooe doth most pinch him, and
therefore, here particular Confessions are necessary: He
that in private contents himself with General Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
shews no great desire to be better; and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
his Confessions, may allow himself in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of Sins, and miscarry, and perish, for all his ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Confessions. But he that in his Confessions spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifies
the particular Acts, wherein he hath walk'd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to God, discovers an earnest desire to grow in
Grace; and, in this, <hi>St. Paul</hi> shews us an example, <hi>1 Tim.
1. 13.</hi> where he doth not say, I have been a great Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
but a <hi>Blasphemer,</hi> spoke ill of the way to Life, a <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuter,</hi>
afflicted, oppressed, and made havock of the
Churches of God, <hi>injurious,</hi> done great injuries to
<hi>St. Stephen,</hi> and to abundance of other Christians. In
a word, such a person, by his particular Confession,
deals faithfully with his own Soul, and, by mentioning
the particular Diseases that annoy him, manifests his ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
desire of a Cure, whereas General Confessions leave
the Soul ignorant, dull, careless, and unaffected with
the great Concerns of Salvation. And tho' a person,
every time he accuses himself, or confesses his Errors, is
not bound to enumerate all the particular Sins of his
Life he can charge his Memory with, yet if he never did it
before, it's fit he should do it, at least when first he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
the Holy Sacrament, and at other times, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
such fins, as he finds himself most inclin'd to, and
most apt to harbor in his Bosom.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="535" facs="tcp:103387:274"/>
2. These Confessions must be accompanied, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
the Confessions before the Sacrament, with aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
of our Offences, and with shame and confusion
of Face. I joyn these two together, because aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of them is the cause of that confusion, and he that
reflects in his Confessions, what light, what knowledge,
what checks of Conscience, what motions of God's Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
what goodness of God, what mercy, what patience, what
promises, what threatnings, he hath sinn'd against, what
time he hathlost, what opportunities he hath neglected,
what a gracious, what a merciful God he hath offended,
even love it self, and sweetness, and beauty it self, and
what blessings, what priviledges, what advantages, what
offers he hath slighted, will find himself obliged, to have
very low and mean thoughts of himself. This was the
<hi>Publican</hi>'s case, <hi>Luke 18. 13. Who standing afar off, would
not lift up so much as his Eyes to Heaven, but smote upon his
Breast, saying, God be merciful to me a Sinner.</hi> He was
ashamed, and confounded. His Conscience told him,
how unworthily he had dealt with his Creator, how
strangely he had carried himself to God, his best and
greatest Friend, how unthankful, and how base, he had
been to his most gracious Benefactor, and how strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he had carried himself to the best of Beings. He
was confounded with the thoughts of his vileness, and
conscious of his guilt, he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ast his eyes to the ground,
unable to look his offended Father in the Face. His
Heart was full of grief, Sorrow fate heavy on his Soul;
and though his Tongue could not express his particular
acts of injustice, oppression, pride, anger, and greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
after the World, yet his Mind confess'd them,
thought of them, his Heart was ready to break at the
dismal sight, and this was a very acceptable Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>3. These Confessions must be joyned with invincible
purposes, to endeavour after a better and more Spiritu-Temper.
So the wise Man tells us: <hi>He that confesses his
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:103387:275"/>
Sins, and forsakes the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, shall find mercy,</hi> Prov. 28. 13.
Without this Qualification, our Confessions are mere
Lip-services, and rceive not one gracious Look from
above, nay, are accounted no better than <hi>Israel</hi>'s Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>Hos. 10. 1. Israel is an empty Vine; He brings forth
fruit unto himself:</hi> Why unto himself? The reason is,
because, in that fruit, he aim'd not so much at God's
Glory, as his own Profit: Nor was any Person the better
for it, the design was selfish, it was just to satisfie the
present terror within, no love of God lay at the bottom,
the ground of all was self-love, and God had nothing
to do with it. The same may justly be said of him that
confesses, but is not concern'd, whether his Flesh be
subdued to the Spirit, or not. Such a Confession is his
own invention, it is not that Confession which God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires.
If he confesses, it must not be to himself, for
God regards it not; and indeed, till this actual endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to forsake them is added to the Confession, our
Sins continue still in God's Books of Accompt, look
still as black as ever, not one of them is blotted out,
for the enmity against God is still maintained, and whilst
that lasts, it naturally follows, that God and we cannot
be friends.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>III. The</hi> second act of judging our selves, is, upon this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
to condemn our selves. <hi>And indeed, if the Soul be
truly awake, and the Heart sincerely sensible of its errors
and miscarriages, the Penitent cannot but condemn
himself, and acknowledge, that the Judgments threatned
in the word of God, are due to him, and cry;</hi> Ah! my
God, and my Lord! Who shall deliver me from the Body of
this death, from this confluence of Misery! I have deserv'd
with <hi>Adam,</hi> to be thrown out of <hi>Paradise,</hi> and to be for
ever forbid eating of the Tree of Life! I have deserv'd to
drown'd with the <hi>first World,</hi> or to be consumed for ever as
<hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah.</hi> I have deserved the sudden and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
death of <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu;</hi> to be stoned with <hi>Achan;</hi>
to be struck with Leprosie, as <hi>Miriam;</hi> to be swallowed up
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>live by the Earth, as <hi>Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram.</hi> I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:103387:275"/>
               <hi>Manasseh</hi>'s Prison, and <hi>Zedekiah</hi>'s Chains, and,
what is worse, the everlasting Chains of Darkness. I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge,
that I have deserved, it should be more tolerable
for Infidels in the Great Day, than for me; for I have seen
the mighty works of God, and continu'd a stranger to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
I have deserved to be called upon at Midnight, as
that careless Man, Thou Fool, this Night thy Soul shall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
of thee, and whose shall be, which thou hast provided?
To this Wretch, that is before thee, belongs nothing but Wrath
and Indignation. On this Head of mine, thou mightest just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
discharge the Ordinance of Justice, and pour out the Vials
of thy Wrath! On me, thou mightest justly rain snares, and
Fire, and Brimstone. I have deserv'd to be plagued with Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seases,
tormented with grievous Pain, haunted by panick Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors.
If any of these Judgments do not fall upon mee, it is
thy Patience, not my Goodness, and I may wonder I have esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
them all this while. I have deserved to be made a
Prey to that Devil, whose Temptations I have swallow'd
with Greediness. Instead of rejoycing over me to build me
up, thou mightest justly rejoyce over me, to destroy me. Just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
O Lord, thou mightest send upon me trembling of Heart,
and fainting of Eyes, and sorrow of Mind. I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd,
that my Life should hang in doubt before me, that I
should fear day and night, that, in the Morning I should say,
Would God it were Even, and at Even, Would God it were
Morning. Mercy, Lord, I have deserved none. The Crums
that fall from thy Table, are Blessings too good for me; if I
deserve any thing, it is thy Rod, thy Scourges, thy Waves,
thy Billows, and a horrible Tempest. <hi>To condemn, is the
proper act of a Judge, and he that thus condemns him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
judges himself.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>IV. The third act of Judging our selves, is, to inflict
Judgments upon our selves.</hi> By which, I do not mean
maiming or wounding our selves, or cutting off an Arm,
or a Leg, or whipping our selves, but inflicting such
Judgments on our selves for the Sins we have been guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of, and so often fallen into, as are neither hurtful to
the Body, nor unprofitable, nor prejudicial to the Soul,
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:103387:276"/>
but serve rather to bring the Soul into an excellent tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.
These Judgments, though the design of them is
to meliorate the Soul, yet they are in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
to be inflicted on the Body, because the Body
tempts the Soul to great extravagancies, and by present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a thousand pleasant Objects to her, leads her into
Nets, and Snares, and Dangers. The Judgment there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
must be laid upon that part, which is the tempter,
and that being under restraint, the Soul may more free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
move toward her Center, God blessed for evermore.
It's true, naturally, no Man hates his own Flesh, but
cherishes it, and makes much of it; but Grace, and the
Gospel, teaches us to treat it with greater rigour. To be
too fond of the Body, in <hi>St. Bernard</hi>'s sense, is a <hi>Charity
which destroys Charity, a Mercy which is full of Cruelty, for
this is to serve the Body, in order to kill the Soul; Is this
Charity,</hi> saith he, <hi>to tender the Body and to neglect the Soul?
To caress the Handmaid, and to let the Mistress starve? Let
no Man think, that for being thus merciful, he will ever ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
mercy.</hi> So that the Flesh and Body are to be treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as a wild or unruly Horse, if we curb him not, he
will give us a fall. Our Bodies are greater Enemies
than we are aware; they are friends too, but the hurt
they do too often to our Souls, shews, they are greater
Enemies than Friends, and therefore the Fathers do so
often call the Flesh, the <hi>Grave of the Soul;</hi> a <hi>Prison,</hi>
where we are held Captive; and a <hi>Dungeon,</hi> where we
sit in Darkness. The <hi>Platonists</hi> used to say, that our
Souls, deriving their Original from Heaven, are sent
into this World to shew forth the Praises of God here
on Earth, as the Angels do in Heaven: but the Body,
the Soul is in, is a kind of Inchanted Castle, in which
the Soul, through the flatteries of the Flesh, forgetting
too often her nobler Extraction, is diverted from her
glorious Designs, and debased to vile Employs: And to
this purpose, <hi>Seneca,</hi> That the Body is the weight and
punishment of the Soul, lying heavy upon it ready to
link it, and putting Shackles upon her, if Philosophy
do not make a Reformation. The Body therefore, be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:103387:276"/>
such a treacherous Servant, must feel the effects of
our Justice, as it hath been the great instrument of the
Sins we have committed, that it may be more modest
in its Desires. And accordingly we find, that good
Men in all Ages, when they have sate as Judges upon
themselves, to shew their detestation of the Sins they
have been guilty of, have inflicted Judgments on that
part, which is most sensible of any thing that is uneasie,
not out of any ill will to it, for it is God's Creature, but
to preserve both Body and Soul unto Salvation. So
<hi>David</hi> punish'd himself for his Sins, sometimes by <hi>ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
his Drink with Weeping,</hi> Psal. 102. 9. Sometimes by
<hi>making Sackcloth his Garment,</hi> Psal. 69. 11. Sometimes
by <hi>weakening his Knees with Fasting and Prayer,</hi> Psal. 109.
24. Sometimes by <hi>making his Bed swim with Tears,</hi> Psal.
6. 6. Sometimes by great acts of Self-denial, <hi>as overcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
Shimei'<hi>s Malice with Patience and Meekness,</hi> 2 Sam.
16. 10. <hi>And delivering him, that without cause was his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi>
Psal. 7. 4. <hi>And keeping Fasts and Humiliation Days,
for the recovery of those that were his Enemies,</hi> Psal. 35. 13.
Sometimes by <hi>lying all Night upon the Earth, or Floor,</hi>
2 Sam. 12. 16. Sometimes by <hi>rising at Midnight to praise
God,</hi> Psal. 119. 61. So the Penitent Publican punish'd
himself by <hi>a violent smiting his Breast,</hi> Luke 16. 13. So
<hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> punished her self, by washing <hi>the Feet of
the Lord Jesus with her Tears, and wiping them with the
Hair of her Head,</hi> Luke 7. 37. So <hi>Zacheus</hi> punish'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
by giving <hi>the halfe of his Goods to the Poor, and by
fourfold Restitution,</hi> Luke 19. 7. So <hi>St. Paul punished
himself, by keeping under his Body, and bringing it into sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,</hi>
1 Cor. 9. 27. <hi>By making himself a Servant to all,
that he might gain the more,</hi> 1 Cor. 9. 19. <hi>By labouring Day
and Night that he might not be chargeable to the Church,</hi>
1 Thess. 2. 9. <hi>By denying himself in Marriage,</hi> 1 Co. 9. 5.
So <hi>Daniel</hi> punished himself for his own and his People's
Offences, three Weeks together, <hi>by eating no pleasant Bread,</hi>
by avoiding Flesh and Wine, and forbearing to anoint
himself, <hi>Dan. 10. 2, 3.</hi> So the Primitive believers punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
themselves by various Self-denials in the Pleasures,
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:103387:277"/>
Satisfactions, and Recreations of the Flesh, and of the
World, thereby to express their Anger, either against
Sin in general, or against some particular Sins they had
run into. But the most usual Judgment that good Men
have ever inflicted on themselves, as a Testimony of
their Displeasure against themselves, for offending God,
hath been Fasting and Prayer, or chastening their Flesh
by frequent Fasts spent in deprecations of God's Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and in other exercises of Humiliation, and when
Men have said to them, Why are you so cruel, as not
to spare your Flesh? They have answered, We spare,
or use it, as we do the Earth, which we plough and cut
with Coulters, that it may bring forth more Fruit.</p>
            <p>V. This judging our selves in all its acts, is certainly
very pleasing to God, especially before we come to the
Holy Communion, else <hi>St. Paul</hi> would never have told
us, in the passage mentioned in the beginning of this
Chapter, that, by doing so, we do put a stop to God's
judging of us. So that we have reason to believe, that
God, upon our accusing our selves, or humble Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
stops the mouth of the <hi>Accuser of our Brethren,</hi>
which is open against us; who this is, we may learn
from <hi>Rev. 12. 10.</hi> even the <hi>Devil,</hi> who brings severe
Accusations against us before God night and day; and
as he wants neither Wit nor Malice to do it, so we have
an instance of it in the History of <hi>Job, Chap. 1. Ver. 9.</hi>
Where appearing among the Sons of God, whether
wrapt up in a dark Cloud, or in the form of an Angel
of Light, is not said, but among the Angels, that gave
an account of their Negotiations here on Earth, to God,
he appear'd; and as those Ministring Spirits were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending
<hi>Job</hi> for his exemplary Virtue, so he, displeased
at the fair Character, immediately seeks to blast and sully
it, by aspersions and misconstructions; and thus, we
must suppose he deals with other persons that have the
same inclinations to Virtue, for those Examples are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded
in Scripture, not only to tell us what happened
just at such a time, but what will happen in future Ages,
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:103387:277"/>
under the same Circumstances. And therefore, though
our actions be never so innocent, nay, though our good
Works be never so sincere, yet they shall not want his
false Glosses, and Comments, and Misconstructions; and
where our Actions are ill, we must expect, he will ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate
them, make them worse, and blacken them, to
an high degree. But where the Penitent says all the ill he
can of himself, gives as bad a description in a manner of
himself, as the Enemy can do; prostrates himself before
God, grants all that is brought against him by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
with any colour of Truth, is so for far from palliating
his Follies, that he unfolds and lays them open before
God, and makes as full a Narrative of them as he can,
pleads guilty to all that is laid at his door. This inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous
accusation or confession, dashes the Devil's at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts,
and at the sight of it, the Bowels of Almighty
Mercy yearn and melt, and the Enemy is bid to spare
his pains; and the Accusations that drop from the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent's
Mouth, are much sweeter in the ears of God,
than those, which the base Foe brings forth from an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
and malicious Breast. This self-accusation, in the
Penitent, is pleasing Rhetorick in Heaven; God hears
the humble Orator, is delighted with his sincerity, and
charges the Enemy to hold his Peace. And as this self-accusation
renders the accusations of the Devil against
us ineffectual, so our condemning our selves blots out
the Hand-writing that is against us, and makes void the
sentence of Condemnation our Sins have deserv'd, and
this is to conform to God's Justice, as well as to his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts;
God looks upon our Sins, as having deserv'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenchable
Fire; and, by his Conscience, tells the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
Thou art an Heir of Damnation, and a Child of
Wrath; and where the Sinner eccho's the Thunder of
God, and answers in the same Voice and Language of
Condemnation, is both sensible, and owns, that he hath
deserv'd the Punishment that Rebels do; this makes ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
Musick in Heaven, Musick so delightful, that
God changes the voice of Terror into a still one, and the
Accents of Wrath into softer strains of Mercy. In this
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:103387:278"/>
Self-condemnation, if it be hearty, God hath his end;
for when he threatned the Sinner with Condemnation,
it was to oblige him to condemn himself; the End be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
gain'd, God's Condemnation ceaseth, and, as it was
at <hi>Athens,</hi> a free and ingenuous confession of a fault sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the Malefactor's Life; so this condemning our selves
and throwing a black Stone into the Box against our
selves, renders God so favourable, as to let us draw out
a white one, the sign of a gracious Absolution; our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judging
our selves to the everlasting Prison, frees us from
it, and our sentence against our selves, makes so great
an alteration in God's Sentence against us, that Justice
gives place to Mercy, the Judge descends from the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal,
gives us his hand, and talks of nothing less, than
gathering us with everlasting kindness. The same must
be affirmed of inflicting Judgments upon our selves. It
is of that power, that even the Temporal Judgments,
which were design'd against us, are either with-held,
or remov'd upon it; or if not all, yet such as would
have been most afflictive and painful, and most durable;
in doing so, we do that which God would have done,
and doing it voluntarily, and of our own accord, we
escape the Judgment of God: For God having a mind
to stop us in our sinful career, intended to deprive us
of our ease, either by Sickness, or by Losses, or some
other trouble and disaster; and since we voluntarily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
our selves of our ease and quiet, and sensual satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
and repose, by inflicting something that's irk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
to Flesh and Blood upon our selves, God looks,
as it were, upon his Judgment, as needless, and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedes
it. The King of <hi>Israel 1 King. 21. 27.</hi> makes but an
external shew of afflicting himself, and he got the fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Judgment threatned him by <hi>Elijah,</hi> transferr'd from
himself to his wicked Posterity; what then may we
think of these Acts of vindictive Justice upon our selves,
if the Heart joyn with the outward Man, and the Soul
bear her share in the Mortification, as well as the Body.
How the Pagan King of <hi>Niniveh,</hi> his Nobles, and his
People, punish'd themselves for their sins, is graphically
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:103387:278"/>
described, <hi>Jon. 3. 6, 7, 8, 9.</hi> And what follows, v. 10.
<hi>God saw their Works, that they turned from their evil ways,
and God repented of the Evil he said he would do unto them,
and did it not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>VI. That which renders this judging our selves so ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
to God, next to the merits of our ever blessed
Jesus, with whom alone God is well pleased, and for
whose sake it is, that he is kind and favourable to us, as
to any thing we do: That which, next to this, renders
this accusing, condemning, and inflicting Judgments up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
our selves, so acceptable to God, are,</p>
            <p>1. The Humility that appears in it. That's the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
sight, and the glorious thing, which the high and
lofty One delights in. That's the Flower God loves to
smell to, the beautiful Garment he loves to see the King's
Daughter in, the sweet Frame he hath made so many
gracious Declartions to: He sees the Soul abominating
her self for her Abominations; an huge sense of her
own vileness over speads all that is within her. He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds,
what lowly thoughts the penitent Creature hath
of himself, and how despicable he is in his own Eyes,
and what strong apprehensions he hath of God's Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and his own vileness; <hi>That</hi> attracts the Divine Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
<hi>that</hi> inclines and draws that Sovereign Benevolence,
<hi>that,</hi> in a manner, compels the Almighty into thoughts
of Peace toward him. This Humility is the Image
of his own Son, and with that Face he is ever pleased.
The Soul having no opinion of her self, God conceives
the greater of her. The Waters of Heaven stay not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the tops of Mountains, but roll down into the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Valleys, there the Rain gathers, and causes Fertility,
and a nobler Verdure.</p>
            <p>2. There appears in this judging our selves, a willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to do any thing to be reconciled to God, and that's
another thing, which very much takes with the Father
of the Spirits of all Flesh; He that accuses, condemns,
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:103387:279"/>
and inflicts Judgments upon himself, discovers a long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
desire to be receiv'd into God's Favour upon any
terms, and shews, That he cares not whatever it cost
him, so he may be but so happy, as to enjoy that Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shine.
His great concern is, how he shall be pardon'd
for what's past; as for the future, he will make no bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gains
with his God, but is content to hear his Voice in
all things that he shall say unto him. He is willing to
run upon what errand soever God shall think fit to send
him? willing to be advised, counselled, and directed by
him; willing to forego all Interests, so he may but have
one in his love, and kinder smiles, and may have leave
to call him Father, and to look upon him as his God,
as his Lord, and as his reconciled Father; and this wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingness
is the Plant, God loves to water with Celestial
Dew. Indeed it is a Plant of his own planting, and an
effect of his writing his Law in the inward Parts, and
upon that, it follows, <hi>I will forgive their iniquity, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
their Sins no more,</hi> Jer. 31. 33, 34. But this doth
properly belong to the fourth preparatory Duty, which
is Self-resignation, whereof more in the following Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The Preceding Considerations reduced to far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Practice.</head>
               <p>I. COnfession of Sins is no such trivial, slight and easie
thing, as Men commonly make of it. The
Confession, that a great many Men make to God, in
Publick especially, while their Thoughts are wandring,
their Eyes staring upon sensual Objects, their Souls feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no compunction, no remorse, no grief, and their
minds without any lively apprehension of God's Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and their own Vileness; such Confessions, instead
of obtaining God's pardon and forgiveness, are prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
and attractives of his Indignation. Alas! Sinner,
that's no Confession, where thy Lips only speak thy
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:103387:279"/>
Sorrow and Offences, and thy Heart still goes after Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousness.
In this case, thou dost but speak into the
Air whilst thou confessest not with shame, and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of Face, and with purposes strong and Masculine,
strong as Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> to offend thy God wilfully no
more; such Confessions reach not the Throne of Grace
and Mercy, but, like Smoke, are dispers'd in the ascent,
and cause no delight, but in the powers of Darkness,
who are glad to see thee play with Religion, and jest
with Devotion.</p>
               <p>II. It is a certain Rule, where Men are loth to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
their Sins, they will be loth to confess them too.
There are divers Actions of Human Life, which being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
pleasing to the Flesh, and suited to the humour of the
Age, and such as preserve our Credit and Reputation
with Men, which we overlook, take to be no Sins, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
are loth to be depriv'd of them, and therefore,
do not so much as mention them in our Confessions.
Search thy Heart, Christian, and take a serious view of
thy Dress, thy Habit, thy Looks, thy Behaviour, thy
Speeches, and thy Conversation, and see, whether thou
hast not reason to suspect many things, of being contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to the stricter Rules of the Gospel, yet thou art loth
to know them, loth to own them, loth to confess them,
as Sins, and all because thou hast no mind to part with
them. Thy wanton looks and glances; thy lascivious
gestures, and postures, and dresses; thy striving for pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and discontent at other Men's omitting to give thee
the Honour thou fanciest to be due to thee; thy despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
and scorning thy Neighbour in thy Heart; thy
touchiness at Trifles; thy secret Injustice; thy careless
and unprofitable Talk; thy gaudy Attire, which feeds
thy Pride; thy delight in imitating the looser and more
wanton sort of People; thy mispending thy Time in
dangerous Sights and Recreations; thy neglect of read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Word, and praying with thy Family; thy ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
exceptions at thy Neighbour's Actions; thy wilful mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constructions
of Men's words; thy hidden things of disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty;
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:103387:280"/>
thy doing evil, that good may come out of it;
thy extenuations of Sin, thy putting favourable names
upon what thou art loth to leave, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> What Man of
sense, and who reads the Word of God, but must suspect,
that these things, and such like, are disagreeable to the
Gospel of our Lord <hi>Jesus Christ?</hi> And yet, because thou
wouldst fain preserve and keep all these, or some of
these, or others, that are not unlike these, thou art wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
ignorant of their sinfulness, or wilfully forgettest
them, or dost carelesly pass them by, and confessest on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
such Sins, as thou canst not well avoid acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
Thou thinkest; if once thou confessest these things
to be Sins, thou must be forc'd to leave them; for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
it is perfect impudence to tell God, that I sin
against him in such things, and yet to go on in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
of them. And therefore, the only advice that
can be given in this case, is this, Look upon Heaven as
worth doing any thing to gain it, and thou wilt not be
afraid, either of knowing thy particular Sins, or of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing
of them, or of bending the force and powers of
thy Soul against their insinuations.</p>
               <p>III. We may easily guess at the reason, why a carnal
Man wonders at the stir, a Penitent keeps to be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled
to God; He sees not, he knows not, what Poison
there is in Sin. A Person, who never troubled his Head
much about Religion, seeing a Man or Woman take
on for their Offences, accuse themselves, condemn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and inflict Judgments of Fasting, of Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and of Self-denial, upon themselves, no doubt, will
admire what ails the Fool to keep such a whining and
howling, and put himself to such needless troubles to
recover the favour of God, which, he fancies, is to be
had at as easie a rate, as Children's Smiles, and Infants
Tears. Indeed, if the love of God may be had with a
wish, and a Man could no sooner send for it, but have
it; or were it a thing we could command to attend us
at a minute's warning, prostrations and lyings on the
Ground, and Sackcloth, and Alms-giving in larger pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions,
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:103387:280"/>
and all the rigorous Ceremonies of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
would be Phantastical, and a mere distemper of
the Brain; but when the Men, whom God favoured
much, vouchsafed his Inspirations to, and who conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
with the fountain of Wisdom, with him, that is the
Way and the Life, did all this, and much more, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended
the same Acts of Mortification to their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors,
and God himself expresses the welcome Dress
of Repentance, as to the External part, in such things
as these, <hi>Jer. 6. 26. Jer. 7. 29.</hi> There we must give
Men leave to laugh, to wonder, and to think us distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd
for doing so. Stange! Men should not see the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of denying their Bodies in that ease and latitude,
they are so apt to take, in order to a better Life, when
is evident, that the Flesh, in the Circumstances it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
naturally, is in a continual fermentation of evil de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires,
and covets altogether sensual satisfactions, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
considering, whether they are agreeable to Reason,
or no; and, like <hi>Salomon</hi>'s Horse-leech, cries still, <hi>Give,
Give;</hi> And if a Man give his Eyes, or Taste, the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
they desire to day, to morrow they shall still crave
more; so that if a severe Mortification do not stop, and
cast them off, especially if he intends to be saved, he
will continue a carnal Man to his dying day. It hath
been the practice of all the Primitive Saints, to inflict
seasonable Judgments on themselves; not one, but the
greatest part, have taken that way, and the reason is
clear, for we must become Saints by the Spirit of the
Cross, which is evidently a Spirit of Mortification both
of Soul and Body; The design of Holiness is to make
us conformable to the temper of our Saviour; and if his
Spirit be in us, we shall be desirous to dye to the World,
and have great inclinations to suffer with him; and this
is not to be done, but by bridling both Soul and Body,
through a severe Mortification.</p>
               <p>IV. In inflicting Judgments upon our selves, the
Word of God must be our guide. He that should use
all the Mortifications he meets with in Ecclesiastical Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story,
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:103387:281"/>
especially in the Fourth and Fifth Centuries after
<hi>Christ,</hi> might run himself into great Errors and Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies.
The Scripture is ever the safest Rule, which,
when Men have forsaken, and thought to do more than
is commanded, or recommended by Examples in that
Book, they have been often lest exposed to great Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.
He that follows an Example of Penitential ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor,
recorded in Scripture, though some imprudence
may mingle with the imitation, yet it is an error of the
Right Hand. There have been excesses of Devotion in
all Ages, and even good Men have sometimes run be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the bounds prescribed them by Almighty God,
into superstition, especially in things relating to volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
affliction of the Body; and from hence have grown
those abuses in Popery, where Penances have swallow'd
the measures of substantial Piety, and Men's inflicting
of Judgment upon themselves, hath been a means to
make them neglect Faith, Judgment, and Mercy. This
shews the necessity of keeping close to the Rule of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
which, besides the Precepts, hath thought fit to
Record such Examles, as are sufficient to instruct us
both in the nature of Repentance, and the Rigors that
in some cases are to bear it company. It's certain, that
in some persons, strong habits of Sin will not be dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
or broke, but by Corrosives, and violent Remedies,
and where a Man sees, that the corruption, which
cleaves to him, baffles all softer Applications, he must
needs save himself, from being undone, by lancing the
wound; <hi>Maimonides,</hi> the learned Jew, in his Rules of
Ethicks,<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </note> gives this advice to his Disciples, that
would arrive to any considerable degree in vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.
<hi>He,</hi> saith he, <hi>that hath been guilty of one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme,</hi>
i. e. <hi>He that finds an habit of a certain sin in
himself; to become good, must, at first at least, run into
the opposite extreme of the Virtue, which is its contrary, till
he be qualified to walk in the middle way without danger;</hi>
i. e. <hi>He that finds himself very cholerick and passionate, to
arrive to an habit of meekness, must at first run into an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
of meekness, and be patient, and silent, and contented,
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:103387:281"/>
even under injuries and actions, that, in some measure, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
his anger, and continue thus for some time, till his Soul
be quieted like a weaned Child, and then he may abate of that
excess, and use his meekness with greater discretion; so he
that hath been proud, to mortifie that ill habit, or extreme,
must apply himself to the other, and be humble, even to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
and reproach, so long, till his stubborn affection be
subdued, and then he may use his humility with greater mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.</hi>
We see, by this, that Jews as well as Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
are sensible, that, without a rigor and severe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scipline,
there is no arriving to any height of Goodness,
and Religion; yet as this inflicting Judgments upon our
selves, is a thing of great use in the weighty Work of
true Repentance, and in the support of a serious Life;
so care must be taken, that all opinion of Merit be laid
aside in the practice of it, for if such a Worm get into
the Timber of the Sanctuary, it soon rots it; nor must
we think, that after we have exercised such Acts of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
upon our selves, for the Sins we have committed,
we may, upon the credit of it, take fresh liberty to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
God. The design of it, is, to mortifie our Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite
to Sin, an therefore, must not prove fewel of that
Fire. To this must be added Discretion and Moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the management of these Acts of Justice, and, as
by inflicting upon our selves the Discipline of Fasting
and Humiliation before the Holy Sacrament, not a few
Christians find much Comfort, if their Bodies be able
to bear it; so in times of Sickness, or bodily Weakness,
this inflicting of Judgment on our selves, becomes use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
and unnecessary, for, in these cases, God inflicts
Judgments, and therefore we need not: All we have
to do at such times, is, to kiss the Rod, and to bear
God's gentle Corrections, as things we have both de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd,
and are intended for the renewing of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Man. Our <hi>English Histories</hi> tell us of two Men,
in the time of Popery, one, who, upon his Death-bed,
when the Priest came to him with the Holy Sacrament,
would be dragg'd like a Traitor out of his
Bed,<note place="margin">Willam de Raley, and Wil. Longspe.</note> to the place where the Priesthood;
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:103387:282"/>
and another, who, hearing the Bishop was come to
Administer the Sacament to him, would needs crawl
out of his Bed half naked, with an Halter about his
Neck to receive it: But as I know not, what Motives
or Impulses they might have for these Actions, so I am
loth to judge, whether they did ill, or not.</p>

               <p>MY Lord, and my God! my Shepherd, my Master, my
Helper, and the Lifter up of my Head, my Light, my
Way, my Wisdom, my Righteousness, my Sanctification, my
Redemption! O, how I could be revenged on those Madnesses,
Follies, Vanities, I have been guilty of! I do not only confess
them unto thee, O thou searcher of all Hearts! but I could even
bruise, and wound, and tear my self, for being so basely, and
so monstrously ungrateful to the best of Masters, if that were
a Sacrifice pleasing unto thee! How stupid, how sensless have
I been! How averse from that, which is my greatest inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest!
Ah! how like a blind Creature have I groped in the
dark, and thought my self secure and safe, while I have stood
upon the brink of destruction! How bold and daring have I
been, and what pains have I taken for Pleasures and Recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations,
which, besides the unreasonableness, and transitoriness,
and inconstancy of them, could not be expiated neither, O dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Saviour, but by thy Blood and Death! O, how heavy,
how dreadful, must my Sins be, that require so costly a satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction!
O Eternal Father, To see what thou hast done for
my Salvation, To see how, for my sake, thy Son, thine only
Son, is in a manner left destitute, without Help, without Assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
without Comfort, what can I think but that in some
respect thou didst love me more than him? That I might
rejoyce, he must be sorrowful to a Prodigy; that I might be
healed, he must be wounded; that I may be cleansed, he must
spill his precious Blood! O, how faithful art thou to forlorn
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:103387:282"/>
Man! Thou hast piomised to restore him, and behold, Thou
givest the richest Treasure of Heaven to effect it. Ah! how
can I see my dear Redeemer weep, and not weep my self! He
grieves not for his own Sins, but for mine; he bewails not
his own faults, but my Transgressions; he never sinn'd, but
I am he that hath offended thee a thousand times! I beseech
thee, accept of the Oblation of thy dear Son, and blot out all
my Transgressions! Accept of that incomparable Sacrifice, and
forget the Injuries I have offered thee! I should be afraid of
being sent away empty from thy Throne, (my Sins are so many
and so great) but that I know thy Sons Merits are great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
than my Sins! If my Sins and his Goodness, my Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions
and the Merits of his bitter Passion, were laid in a
Ballance together, these would weigh for heavier than mine
Offences! What Crime so great, that such a Sorrow, such Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction,
such Obedience, such Humility, such invincible Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and, what is more than all this, such infinite Love, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
expiate? What Iniquity can there be in the World, above
which the Death of Christ doth not preponderate! O Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Father! I have nothing of mine own to offer thee! But I
offer thee my Saviour, my Redeemer, thine only Son, with all
possible Devotion and Gratitude! Accept of his unspeakable
Grief and Anguish, known only to him, and to thy self, for
my Sins, and that Grief I should have, and do not feel! Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
of his bloody Sweat and Tears, for want of my Tears!
Accept of his most fervent Prayers, for my dulness and dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in Prayer! Accept of all that ever he did, and suffer'd,
for my great and multiplied Transgressions! I accuse my self
for my Carnality, I condemn my self for my backwardness to
serve thee, I am willing to inflict Judgments upon my self for
my innumerable Follies, yet even these Services will look dull,
and weak, and imperfect, except thou art pleased to look upon
them, through the Merits of thy dear Son! O blessed Jesu,
who can comprehend thy Charity! O, pour into my Heart true
Contrition, soften my harden'd Heart into true Compunction,
give to mine Eyes abundance of Tears, that I may bewail the
many Indignities I have offered to thee! Deal not with me af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
my Sins. Let thy bitter Passion step in betwixt thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
Anger, and my miserable Soul! And whatever mine
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:103387:283"/>
Iniquities have deserv'd, let thy Death atone for them, and
let thy Blood wash them away! O thou, who hast overcome
the World, and the Prince thereof, overcome all my rebellious
and inordinate Affections! Let nothing separate betwixt thy
Love and me! Remove, and conquer, that Disagreebleness,
that is betwixt my Nature, and thy Holiness; and as thou
wast obedient to thy Father, even to the Death of the Cross,
so make my Soul obedient to thee in all thing! O let me see,
and feel, that there is nothing so vile, so abject, so unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,
as I am; and, in this sense, let me admire thy Love,
that it may appear great and wonderful to me, and dash all
those Excuses and Delays, I have pretended too long, to cloak
my unwillingness to please thee; What can melt my heart, if
thy Love cannot melt it? O melt it by that Fire, and purge
away all my Dross, and all my Tin, that, being purified by
thee, I may enjoy the Comforts of that Purity for ever.

            <head type="sub">Of Self-Resignation, the Fourth Preparatory Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
in order to a Worthy Receiving of this
Holy Sacrament.</head>
            <argument>
               <head>The CONTENTS.</head>
               <p>What Self-Resignation is, and wherein it consists. What makes
it necessary. Upon what Account it comes to be a Duty,
preparatory for the Holy Sacrament. God likens himself to
a Potter; and why. Our Perfection proved to consist in
this Self-Resignation.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>1. WHat this Self-Resignation is, and wherein it
consists, is no hard matter to guess. 'Tis,
in short, to resign our Will to God's Will, not only in
being ready to do what God will have us do; but, in
being contented to suffer whatever he shall think fit to
lay upon us. 'Tis St. <hi>Anselm</hi>'s Observation, That God
alone, who is the Creator of all things, can will and do
what he pleases, having no Will superior to his own, to
which he ought to submit: But when Man will do his
own Will, he robs Almighty God, in some measure, of
his Crown; for as the Crown is only the Privilege and
Prerogative of a King, so to do what he pleases is God's
only Property: And, as a Subject that should fly at the
Crown of his Prince, and take it off his Head, would
commit Treason, and do his Sovereign the greatest In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury;
so a Man that will have his own Will, attributes
that to himself, which is a Privilege appertaining only
to Divinity it self. And, indeed, this Self-Resignation
is nothing but an Effect of sincere and cordial Love;
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:103387:284"/>
Love being the Bond that ties and unites the Person
loving to him that is loved, as Hatred dissolves and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
that Bond. This Love consists chiefly in the Will;
and if it be right, it must necessarily oblige him that
loves God, to will what he wills, and take his Pleasure
and Will for his Rule, whereby he governs his own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
and Affections.</p>
            <p>II. That which makes this Self-Resignation to the Will
of God very necessary, are these important Points.</p>
            <p>1. Hereby the Glory of God is signally advanced: It
is the most excellent Sacrifice we can offer to Almighty
God. The Glory of God consists in having his Will ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled:
And since we are both created and redeemed to
advance God's Glory, we commit a very great Errour
in having a different Will from God's Will; for we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
him of the Honour due to him, and which we are
obliged to advance, not only by our Obedience, but by
our Troubles and Dangers too. And if it be such an
Advancement of God's Glory, to do what he will
have us do, and to follow him where he leads, it can be
no less Glory to our selves, to have the Honour to fulfil
his Will in all things. That God, who is far above us,
so infinitely exalted above our frail Natures, should make
use of such poor, miserable Creatures, to glorifie him;
and employ, in the compassing of his admirable De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs,
such vile Worms, when he might make use of far
better, is no small Dignity and Advancement. If a
King were to give Battel to a fierce and numerous Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
and should quit or lay by a bright and Two-edged
Sword, and take a rusty Dagger, with no Point or
Edge, to fight the opposite Army; as it would be a
Mark of his greater Courage, so the Victory he gains by
that means would be more renowned and glorious. We
are in the Hand of God, no otherwise than obtuse and
blunt Daggers are; and that by such contemptible means
he will compass his Glory, is not only the Way to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
his own Honour, but ours too. When the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:103387:284"/>
of <hi>Socrates</hi> had all made their Masters very noble
Presents, <hi>Aeschines,</hi> who was very poor, came to him,
and told him, <hi>Sir, I have nothing to give you, that is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of you; and therefore, take the only thing I have to give;
that is, my self. Socrates</hi> was extreamly pleased with this
Offer. And <hi>Seneca</hi> adds, that by this Present <hi>Aeschines</hi>
exceeded all the rich Gifts, not only of <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> whose
Gifts were equal to his generous Mind, but all the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents
of the rest. A Man can give nothing to God,
that is more pleasing to him, than his Will; and in giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him his Will, he gives him all his Content, his Love,
his Honour, his Health, and his Wealth; for he leaves
all these to his Disposal.</p>
            <p>2. Nothing comes to pass without God's Providence.
Our Sicknesses, Poverty, Exile, Losses, Crosses, Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
Accidents, which foolish Men are apt to ascribe to
Chance, are all govern'd by his Almighty Hand, and
sent by his Order: So that, not to conform our Wills
to his Will in these Cases, is a tacit Denial of his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.
Nay, though the Afflictions and Miseries which
may befal us, may be inflicted by wicked Instruments,
the Devil, and evil Men; yet, as God hath no Hand
in their Sins, so he hath certainly an Hand in the Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:
And this is one great Design of the Holy Ghost,
in Scripture, to direct us how to refer all things, even
the most displeasing, and the most disagreeable to Flesh
and Blood, to God's Providence. <hi>Job</hi> therefore, though
the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> and the Devil were the External Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
whereby his Calamities were sent upon him,
yet he acknowledges God in all; and, in his Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
ascribes his Losses, not to the Devil, not to the
<hi>Chaldeans,</hi> but to God; <hi>The Lord gave, and the Lord hath
taken away; blessed be the Name of the Lord,</hi> Job 1. 21.
It was therefore a very wise Answer which <hi>Lupus,</hi> the
Bishop of <hi>Troy,</hi> gave to <hi>Attila,</hi> the King of the <hi>Huns,</hi>
who, with an Army of Five Hundred Thousand Men,
had burnt, and destroyed, and laid waste abundance of
Countries: Coming at last before <hi>Troy,</hi> the Bishop and
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:103387:285"/>
his Clergy, in their Robes, went out to meet him; and
as they came into his Presence, the Bishop craved Leave
to ask him, who he was? <hi>Attila,</hi> with a fierce and stern
Countenance, told him, <hi>I am the Scourge of God. Are
you so,</hi> saith the Bishop? <hi>Who then is able to resist you?
And, since you are so, pray come, and beat and scourge us as
you think fit, and as God shall permit you.</hi> An Answer,
which <hi>Attila</hi> was so well pleased with, that he spared
the Town, and passed through it, without doing the
Inhabitants the least hurt. This good Man saw the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
of God in it, and conformed his Will to God's
Will; and thereby teaches us, that this Self-Resignation
is the Way to see an happy Issue of our Afflictions.</p>
            <p>3. As nothing comes to pass without a special Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
so whatsoever befals us is governed by infinite
Wisdom, and comes upon us wise and holy Ends,
though for the present we cannot see to the Bottom of
them; and that is a very great Motive to this Self-Resig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.
As the whole World is governed by the Infl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice
Wisdom of God, so Man in a particular man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
and more especially those that fear him; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
God commands us any thing, or will have us suffer
any thing, it is still for the noblest Ends, even his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and our own Eternal Salvation. And, to say the
Truth, a Man can give no better, no greater Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
of his Wisdom, then in denying his own Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Will, and submitting them to the Wisdom of
God: For, take the greatest and most exact Wisdom
that is in man, or ever hath been, even the Wisdom of
<hi>Solomon,</hi> if it be compared with the Wisdom of God,
it is mere Darkness and Ignorance; so that, to resign
our selves to the Wisdom and Will of God in all things,
must be the greatest Wisdom. If a Man that is born
blind, should restise to take a wise Guide with him, and
particularly, his own Father, who entirely loves him,
a prudent Man, and who knows the Way perfectly; all
would take him for a Mad-man, and blind in Soul, as
well as Body. And how are we better than such a
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:103387:285"/>
Man, if we are afraid to follow our Heavenly Father, even
then when he leads us over Rocks, and Precipices? For we
have reason to trust the hand that guides us, whatever Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
offer themselves to our minds to the contrary, nor
can we be deceiv'd in our Trust, for he that guides us, is
infinitely Wise. The Wisdom of God is to be seen in
inequalities, as much as in any thing: A Body would
not be beautiful, if all the parts were of an equal
bigness, some parts standing out, and others being
depressed, some, being big, and others little, make up
the Beauty of the whole; as in the Fabrick of the Earth,
Mountains, and Hills, and Dales, Rocks, and fruitful
Fields, being mingled one with another, make the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick
more stately than otherwise it would be: the same
may be said of our Lives, which being chequered with
Adversity and Prosperity, with Light and Darkness, with
good Report, and evil Report, declare at once their Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and God's Wisdom, so that we may confidently affirm,
That the Sovereign Reason, which is God, can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
contrary to Reason, in things that concern us,
even then, when sometimes they seen to be contrary;
so that this makes Self-resignation a necessary Duty.</p>
            <p>III. But here a Question will arise, Why this Duty
of Self-resignation is to be exercised and practised, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
before we receive the Holy Sacrament of the
<hi>Eucharist;</hi> and how comes this to be a Preparative for
this Ordinance, and the Worthy Receiving of it? To
which I must answer as follows.</p>
            <p>1. This is to imitate our Blessed Saviour, who, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he went to dye, resigned his Will to his Holy Father's
Will, <hi>Luke 22. 42. Father, if thou be willing, remove
this Cup from me, nevertheless, not my Will, but thine, be
done:</hi> And what more proper, than before we remember
this Death, to use the same Self-resignation. To imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
him in all his Actions, except the Miraculous, is
our Duty and Glory. We cannot imitate a better Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern;
nay, the desin of the Gospel is to plant in us a
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:103387:286"/>
conformity to his Temper, and to oblige us to tread in
his steps. If we do no not, it's as much as our Lives are
worth, and he will not own us for his Disciples; The
very name <hi>Christian</hi> imports so much; and as a <hi>Pythago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rean</hi>
is one, that believes, and lives as <hi>Pythagoras</hi> lived;
so a <hi>Christian</hi> is he, that believes, and lives as <hi>Christ</hi> did
live; and therefore, <hi>learn of me,</hi> Matth. 11. 26. contains
the whole Duty of a Christian. Of this, the late famous
<hi>Antonette Baurignon,</hi> (if it be true, what is said in the
History of her Life) had very early apprehensions; for
when she was but a Girl of four years of Age, having
heard of her Parents and Friends, what <hi>Christ</hi> had taught,
and how he lived, and that by him we must enter into
Eternal Life, she was exceedingly desirous to go into
that Country, where Men lived as <hi>Christ</hi> had taught
them, and as he lived. Her Friends telling her, that
she lived in a Christian Country, and that all that were
about her were Christians, she shook her Head, profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
that she could not believe them, for those she saw
lived not as <hi>Christ</hi> had taught them, or as he lived, but
rather directly contrary; <hi>For Christ</hi> (said she) <hi>was vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily
poor, and we love Gold and Silver; he was hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and lowly, but we affect Dominion and Greatness; he was
always in Affliction, we hunt for Carnal Pleasures.</hi> The
wisest Person living could not have spoken greater sense;
and if <hi>Christ</hi>'s Actions were intended for Patterns, it
will naturally follow, that as he entirely resign'd himself
to his Father's Will, before he went to dye, so it's ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
fit, that his Disciples, when they come to remember
his Death in a most solemn manner in the Sacrament,
should follow him in that Self-resignation, the rather,
because, like him, we resolve in this Sacrament, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
for the Glory set before us, to run with patience
the Race which is set before us, for which, this Self-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signation
is absolutely necessary, as will appear more
fully from the following Paragraph.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="559" facs="tcp:103387:286"/>
2. Without this Sel-resignation, one great End, for
which we pretend to come to this Sacrament, is not to
be obtain'd, which is, to learn to imitate Christ Jesus in
his Patience under all sorts of Sufferings, which can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be done without a holy Self-resignation. He that
doth not resign his Will to God's Will in all things,
must necessarily fall into discontents, when any trouble
doth surprize him, especially if it be of the greater sort;
for he will either look altogether upon the second Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
whereby his misery comes, which will make him
quarrel, with the Dog, at the Stone thrown at him; or
he will imagine, that he might have prevented it, and
that it was nothing but his own carelesness and impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
that caused it, and that will make him fret and
fume; or he will fancy, that he hath not deserved such
an Affliction, and that will make him repine; or he
will compare his present afflicted State with the more
happy condition of his Neighbors, and that will occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
great murmurings and complaints; or he will do
little, but pore upon his wretchedness, and that will fill
him with melancholic Thoughts; or he will measure
his Felicity by Worldly Prosperity, and that will una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably
bring the Sorrow of the World upon him; but
a Person that hath resign'd his Will to the Will of God,
can think nothing strange; This <hi>one thing,</hi> that his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction
is the Will of God, will hush and quiet all, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
his Thoughts, lenifie the bitterness and grievous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of his wounds, lessen his grief, cause chearfulness in
his Soul, fortifie his Mind, and make him say with <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,
I was dumb, I open'd not my mouth, because thou didst it,</hi>
Psal. 39. 9. not to mention the Sweetness our Souls
would taste, and be sensible of, in this Holy Sacrament,
if they came with this Self-resignation to the Will of
God, for this would be a preparative for greater Gifts,
for larger Effusions of the Holy Ghost, and richer Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications
of inward Comforts.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <pb n="560" facs="tcp:103387:287"/>
               <head>The Preceding Considerations reduced to Practice.</head>
               <p>I. GOD, <hi>Jer. 18. 2.</hi> doth very fitly compare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to a Potter, who, by the motion of his
Wheel, and the activity of his Hand, gives the Clay
what form and shape he pleases; and the reason, why
he makes use of that similitude, is, because himself form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Man of the Clay of the Earth; and from hence it's
very easie to infer, that if we suffered our selves to be
managed by his powerful hand, as easily, as the Clay
doth by the Potters, we might become most beautiful
Vessels. Nothing in Nature resists the Will of God. The
Heavens readily conform to his pleasure, and all the
Stars move and shine by his Order and Appointment;
the whole Creation doth exactly and punctually submit
to his Law, and Night and Day do not make a false step,
in obeying the Constitutions of the great Architect;
if they should, what confusion would the whole Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
fall into? So our Will, if it suffer it self to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
Govern'd by the Divine, every Member, and
every part in this little World, <hi>Man,</hi> wou'd move in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
harmony; their motions wou'd be circular and
orderly, for nothing causes greater confusion in the
Frame, than when we are loth to leave our selves to his
Conduct. This is the way to arm our selves against all
danger. This abates their force, and enfeebles their vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence
when they come. This checks our needless
Curiosity; and while we enquire, for what reasons God
sends such things upon us, <hi>this one,</hi> answers all Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
<hi>It is the Will of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>II. We see here by what standard we are to measure
Christian perfection, even by this Self-resignation of our
Wills to God's Will. The more we advance in this, the
more perfect we are; and though an absolute perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is not to be obtained in this life, yet to come as near
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:103387:287"/>
that absolute Conformity and Self-resignation, which shall
be in Heaven, as we can, is counted Christian Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
even on this side Heaven. It was therefore wisely
said by <hi>Alphonso</hi> King of <hi>Arragon,</hi> when one of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliars
ask'd him, Who it was, that he counted the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piest
Man? His Answer was; <hi>Him, who receives all things,
whether sad or pleasant, as coming from a kind and wise Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
hand, with an even mind.</hi> And we are told of a
Man, that had the Power of Miracles conferr'd upon
him, and being ask'd of his Friend, How he came by
that Power? He Said, He knew not, except God should
like one thing in him, which was, that he was never
lifted up by Prosperity, nor cast down by Adversity,
and whatever happen'd to him, still he look'd higher,
to the Origin and Spring from whence it came, and that
ever day he made it his business, to desire nothing but
what God desires, and all his Prayers tended that way,
that God's Will might be entirely fulfilled and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished
in him. Even the <hi>Heathen Philosophers</hi> placed Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
in following God, <hi>i. e.</hi> in a chearful submission to
every thing that God would have done; and therefore,
we have a notable address of the <hi>Heathen Epictetus</hi> to his
great Creator, an address fit to be imitated by every
Christian.<note place="margin">Arrian Epict. l. 2. c. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>Great God,</hi> (saith he) <hi>use me hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward
according to thy pleasure. I am altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of thy mind. It is indifferent to me, how
thou dealest with me. I refuse nothing, if thou seest it good
for me. Lead me where thou thinkest it convenient. Cloath
me in what Garment thou pleasest, whether it be whole or torn,</hi>
either <hi>shall be welcome: Whether thou wilt have me bear the
Office of a Magistrate, or lead a private Life; whether thou
wilt have me stay in mine own Country, or let me be driven
into exile; whether thou wilt have me rich or poor; In all
this, by my equanimity, I will justifie thee before Men.</hi> This
Prayer from the mouth of an Heathen, is astonishing,
and the rather, because we see few Christians arrive to
this Self-resignation, that have far greater helps; and
had we no express Command for this Self-resignation in
the Bible, yet that general Precept, of considering and
<pb n="562" facs="tcp:103387:288"/>
doing whatever things are true, and just, and honest,
and lovely, and of a good report, would oblige us to
imitate the very Heathen Philosophers, in so lovely and
reasonable a Duty. But we need not have recourse to
this general hint, the express Precepts and Examples,
that tend to the inforcement of this admirable qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
are so many, that there is no room left for Excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
and Evasions. Whether the story of the Lady of
<hi>Soncino</hi> be true, I know not, but the Moral intended by
it, is agreeable enough to the word of God. The Story
saith, That being, in a Vision, carried up to view the
various Mansions of Glory, She saw some Holy Soul
mingled with the Quire of <hi>Seraphims,</hi> and the highest
Order of Angels, and demanding, who they were, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
was made her, That they were persons, who here
on Earth did entirely resign their Wills to the Will of
God: A thing so rational, that, in omitting it, we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
our selves; for the sick Man leaves himself entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the Conduct of his Physitian; an oppressed Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
to the wisdom and discretion of his Advocate; and
the Blind, to the guidance of his Dog; and therefore,
it must be strange obstinacy, not to resign our selves to
the Conduct of a most wise God; who orders our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
far better, and with far greater advantage to us,
than we do, or can do our selves. The more tracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
any instrument is, the more perfect it is: If a Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
were to draw the Picture of an Emperor, and the
Pencil in his Hand should resist the motions of his Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
make no stroaks, and be dull to any impressions,
form no line, and cast no colour, or should warp, and
flinch to the left hand, when he would direct it to the
right, it would be worth nothing, for its greatest per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
lies, in yielding to the hand that manages it, and
in expressing all the strokes the Workman doth intend
to make. We are instruments in the hand of God,
which he hath made on purpose to serve him in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting
of his Glory, and therefore are obliged to suffer
our selves to be handled by him, and to leave our selves
entirely to his power to turn and wind us, and to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
<pb n="563" facs="tcp:103387:288"/>
us in such things as he thinks convenient, without
any resistance. The natural desire of Mankind, is, to
arrive to Peace and Rest, but the generality take very
preposterous ways to obtain it, when they involve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in a thousand anxious Cares and Troubles, which,
instead of conducting them to that end, drive them far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and farther off; whence it comes to pass, that
though they desire it, yet their desires are never accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish'd.
But this Self-resignation to the Will of God,
is the proper means, and he that lets his own Will dye,
and makes God's Will to live in him, comes safely to
the City of Peace and Rest. All our Inquietude rises
from our resisting the Will of God, from hence flow all
the tempests that molests us, and while we are loth to
do what God would have us do, and unwilling to suffer
what he will have us suffer, it cannot be otherwise, but
that Peace must be a stranger to our Breasts. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
happens in the World, is nothing but the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment
of God's Designs; and the Soul, that would
always have that done what God will have done, can
wonder at nothing that happens to her, for it is her Will,
as well as God's Will. However, if we are loth to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
our selves to his Will, we have reason to fear his
Anger; and if we resist his Will, or are unwilling to
submit to it, he will do his Will upon us, whether we
will or no. If we chearfully submit, he will treat us as
his Children; if not, he will use us as his Slaves: And
therefore, the advice of <hi>Eliphaz,</hi> Job 22. 21, 22. is the
safest Rule we can follow. <hi>Acquaint now thy self with
him, and be at peace, thereby good shall come unto thee. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
I pray thee, the Law from his Mouth, and lay up his
Words in thy Heart. If thou return to the Almighty, thou
shalt be built up, thou shalt put Iniquity far from thy Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle;
yea, the Almighty shall be thy defence, and thou shalt
have plenty of Silver,</hi> i. e. as much content as if thou hadst
plenty of Silver, <hi>for then shalt thou have thy delight in the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty,
and shalt lift up thy Face to God. Thou shalt make thy
Prayer unto him, and he shall hear thee, and thou shalt pay
thy Vows, thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
unto thee, and the light shall shine upon thy ways.</hi>

               <p>O My God, my Lord, my Saviour, God of infinite Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
who dost not only govern thy Creatures by thy great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
but by thy goodness, who canst do no wrong, and hast
used me in particular with that respect and tenderness, even
in the midst of all the afflictions that have come upon me, that
thou hast been more a Father to me than a Judge, and hast
rather embraced me than corrected me. Behold! I am go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to remember, what my dearst Lord hath done for my mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable
Soul on the Cross; and as I am going to remember the
unspeakable Blessings he hath purchased for me, so I desire to
remember my Duty of imitating him in his Self-resignation
to thy Divine and incomprehensible Will. And here, Lord,
I humbly consecrate my Will to thine, I prescribe thee no Rules,
no Methods, how to govern me, but leave my self entirely to
be disposed of according to thy Will, which way soever thou
shalt think fit to lead me to Heaven, and Eternal Happiness,
whether by Hunger or Thirst, or Poverty, or Infamy, or the
rage and envy of Men, or by other miseries; whether by sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
or by health; whether by losses, or unkindness of friends;
whether it be through good report, or evil report; whether
thou wilt have me live, or dye; whether thou wilt have me
dye this Year, or the next, or ten Years hence; whether my
Death shall be sudden, or slow; whether natural, or violent;
whether honourable, or dishonourable; whether upon my Bed,
or in a Wood; whether in Fire, or Water: I am resign'd, and
content to go where thou biddest me, and to endure what, in
thy Wisdom, thou shalt think fit for me. Thy Commands are
reasonable. In Wisdom hast thou made them all. I take
exception at none. I embrace them all. They are the Light
of mine Eyes, and while they be my Guides, I cannot go astray.
Thy Providences also are the effect of Eternal Wisdom. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
happens by chance, Thou rulest all Events. Thou go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernest
all the World; whatever befals me, is either decreed,
or permitted by thee; and when thou dost permit things, thou
<pb n="565" facs="tcp:103387:289"/>
permittest them for weighty and pregnant Reasons. Give me
an Heart devoted to thy fear. Let me neither murmur at
thy Laws, nor repine at thy Dispensations. Let every thing
be welcome and pleasing to me, which thou knowest to be for my
good. Let me not judge of things by outward appearances,
but by thy Will, and unsearchable Wisdom. Give me Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
out of thine own Store, Wisdom, which may resemble
thine. and agree with thine. And then I shall be wise in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
when I shall learn to submit my self to thy infinite Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
then shall I know thee, the only true God, and him,
whom thou hast sent, <hi>Jesus Christ;</hi> to whom, with thee, O
Father, and the Holy Ghost, be all Honour and Glory, for ever
and ever, <hi>Amen.</hi>

            <argument>
               <head>The CONTENTS.</head>
               <p>The Life to be led after Receiving, a Reasonable Service.
Wherein that Service consists. The necessity of it. Men
that are in an unconverted State, live below their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
The Generality of Men very rational in Temporal
Concerns, but very unreasonable in Things, belonging to
their Everlasting Peace. The Prayer.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>I. THough from the Premises any Man may guess,
what life it is, that a Christian, who hath enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
himself to God in this Sacrament, and vow'd Faith
and Allegiance to the King of Saints, is to live after it,
yet to make these instructions complete, I shall briefly
add some <hi>Memorandums,</hi> that are to be observed in our
future Conversation, and though in the foregoing Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
I have often occasionally mention'd such a thing,
as a REASONABLE SERVICE; yet it's time
I should now press it with great earnestness, there being
nothing more proper, nothing more equitable, after such
solemn engagements, than this Service; and if we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
what it is, it will be found to consist In these fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
particulars.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>In an happy agreement of our profession and actions, of
our belief and practices of our Principles and Conversation;</hi>
where our Profession is of one colour, and our Practice
<pb n="588" facs="tcp:103387:301"/>
of another, where our Tongues speak one thing, and
our Lives another, there I need not tell you how we
involve our selves in a palpable contradiction. Things
contradictory mutually destroy each other. A thing that
is cold, cannot at the same time be hot, and what is
black, at the same time, and under the same respects,
cannot be white; and consequently, where the Actions
contradict our Principles, the Actions destroy our Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
and, in God's account, we deny the Principles
too by denying the consequences, which are the actions,
that should naturall issue from those Principles, and
he that hath very good Principles, but allows himself in
bad Actions, cannot be partly good, and partly bad,
but is wholly bad, which makes the Holy Ghost call all
those <hi>Vnbelievers,</hi> which profess the true Worship of God,
and dishonour it by their Lives. <hi>Heb. 3. 17, 18, 19.</hi> But
where I do believe, that God is my Supreme Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,
and therefore prefers his Will and Favour, before
the Will and Favour of Men, when these two interfere,
and are contrary to one another; Where I do believe,
that neither Fornicators nor Adulterers, nor Effeminate,
nor Thieves, nor Covetous, nor Drunkards, nor Revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
nor Extortioners shall inherit the Kingdom of God,
and therefore will not be perswaded, by all the gain and
profit of the World, to venture upon any of these Sins;
If I believe, that my Soul is worth more, than a whole
World, and therefore will not wrong my better part,
though I might have the Riches of the <hi>Indies</hi> for doing
it; If I believe, that if I am ashamed of the Gospel of
<hi>Christ,</hi> and of observing his Laws, the Son of God will
certainly be ashamed of me in the last day; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
take courage to act like a Man that believes it, and
stand up for the Glory and Honour of my God, with
Humility and Modesty in despight of all the reproaches,
and contempt of the World. If I profess and believe,
that if I love not the Lord <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> so as to testifie
my Love in my obedience to him, I shall be for ever
banish'd from the Glorious Presence of God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
express my Love in thinking of him, in Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="589" facs="tcp:103387:301"/>
and Esteeming him within and without; if I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that except my Righteousness exceeds the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees,</hi> I shall in no wise en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into the Kingdom of Heaven, and thereupon actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
shun those Sins, which the Pharisees made nothing
of, there my belief and actions go hand in hand toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and if I hate to profess one thing and to do ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
then my service is truly reasonable, and I have not
receiv'd the Sacrament in vain.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>In subjecting our Flesh and Bodies to our reason.</hi> This
is to make our Members or Bodies, instruments of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
as it is said, <hi>Rom. 6. 13.</hi> And what can be
more reasonable than that the Slave should be subject to
his Lord, the servant to his Master, the base and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
part to the more excellent, the flesh to the Spirit,
and the Law of the Members to the Law of the Mind?
<hi>I have seen,</hi> saith <hi>Salomon, Servants upon Horses, and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
walk as Servants upon the Earth,</hi> Eccl. 10. 7. The
Moral of it is, that it is unnatural, unreasonable, horrid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
monstrous, to make our Reason a slave to our Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest,
and to suffer the Brute to ride the Man; when
Reason is only made use of to cater and provide for
the ease and satisfaction of the Flesh, it is as dismal a
sight, as to see a King brought to the Block, and an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Prince Murther'd by his Subjects. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
where Reason enlighten'd by the day-spring from
on high, and by the Lanthorn of the Word of God,
points at the Will of God, and the Eye will not look
upon vanity, and dangerous shews, and lustful objects,
because Reason saith, that gazing upon them is unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful;
and the Ears will not hearken to corrupt Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications,
nor to filthy jests and talk, because Reason
says, that this becomes not the gravity of Saints; and
the Tongue will not speak any thing, but what may Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
and administer Grace unto the Hearer, because Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
says that this is the Law of the <hi>Spirit of life</hi> in <hi>Christ
Jesus;</hi> and the hands will touch nothing, that may
raise unclean Thoughts or disorderly Desires, because
<pb n="590" facs="tcp:103387:302"/>
Reason says, that this is to shun the occasions of evil;
and the Body will eat and drink moderately, and will
not pamper it self, because Reason says, that Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is the Christians Motto, and the want of it grieves
the Spirit of God; there the Service is reasonable, and
an argument, that we have not receiv'd the Sacrament
in vain.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>In worshiping God with the understanding and inward
Man;</hi> If a Man talks with his Neighbour, his Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
ordinarily is fixt upon the subject he discourses
of; and what is Praying and Praising, but speaking to
God? And surely no rational Creature will think, that
God deserves less attention than Man. If with my Lips
I pray, and my Mind is at <hi>Rome,</hi> or <hi>Constantinople;</hi> if
my Mouth Sings, and my Thoughts are in my Shop;
if I read or hear the Word of God, and my Thoughts
are upon my Trade, or Worldly business, it is a brutish,
not reasonable service. This the very Heathens have
taken notice of, as were an easie thing to prove <hi>Cato,
Epictetus, Plato,</hi> and <hi>Antoninus,</hi> if there were occasion.
The Understanding must bear a principal part in the
Devotion, and I must not only understand the thing I
pray for, but my Understanding and Thoughts must
keep pace with my Prayer, and fix upon the tremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous
Majesty, I address too; and though there are very
few Men so happy, as to fix their Understanding upon
a Spiritual object, in Devotion, without the least varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or wandring of the Thoughts; yet he, that means
to offer God his reasonable service, must hold his Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
to it, as much as lies in him; and, if at any
time it declines from that point, reduce it, and bring it
back again to the Center, from which it hath swerv'd;
and though the service be thereby somewhat interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
yet, as long as the interruption is not wilful, God
will still accept of it, as of a reasonable service.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="591" facs="tcp:103387:302"/>
II. Nor need we wonder, why this should be neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary;
For,</p>
            <p>1. The service must ever resemble God, to whom it
is offer'd, and God being the highest reason, and the
Fountain of it, the service must be answerable. To
worship the most reasonable Being, with unreasonable
offerings, is a thing so absurd, that the very sound of
it is enough to fright us from it. To worship God with
our Bodies, while our Souls do adore and admire some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else, is to make God a sensual Being, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our Saviour from the notion of <hi>God's being a Spirit,</hi>
enforces the Duty of <hi>Worshiping him in Spirit and in Truth,</hi>
Joh. 4. 24.</p>
            <p>2. It is necessary for our own sakes. If it be not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable,
we can take no comfort in it, and besides, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
avoid running into Hypocrisie. Hypocrisie is to
seem to be good, and not to be so, as a false Pearl
seems to be Oriental, but is not. It's this reasonable
service, which must give our Devotion its just weight
and goodness; where this is wanting, a Man seems
to please God, but doth not, and from hence must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
arise great delusions, and deceptions; and
the Soul that hath long flatter'd her self with external
services, when before the great Tribunal it shall find,
how wofully and wilfully it has mistaken the nature and
design of the Gospel, must fall into everlasting Grief
and Torment.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The Preceding Considerations reduced to far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Practice.</head>
               <p>I. TO be in an unconverted estate, and to live be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
ones reason, are one and the same thing.
Look upon a poor sensual Wretch, that is yet a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="592" facs="tcp:103387:303"/>
to the life of God; He rejoyces in those Sins, which
will make him infallibly miserable; He stands upon the
brink of Destruction, and Laughs; God is angry with
him, and he is pleased with it. He prefers a Stone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Bread, a Serpent before a Fish. He glories in
his Shame, Triumphs in his Fetters, breaks the Laws
of the great Thunderer, and justifies his actions, and
what is this, but madness and distraction? And, O
Sinner! Is this a condition to sleep another Night in?
Is this a State to continue in one Moment longer? A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake,
awake thou sluggard, lest the Revenger of Blood
overtake thee?</p>
               <p>II. What pity is it, to see Men so rational in their
Temporal Concerns, and so unreasonable in the things,
which belong to their everlasting Peace! They would
not make a false step, nor do an imprudent action, in
the management of their Estates and Fortunes, yet
manage the greatest concerns of their Salvation so sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lily,
so foolishly, so irrationally, that one would think,
they were intended for no higher life, than that of
Bees and Butter-flies. O Christians! Is there such a
thing, as a life to come, and an immortal Life, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased
by the Blood of the Son of God, and is it not
reasonable to look after it, with the greatest applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of your minds and understandings? What will all
your Wisdom, in getting provision for the Flesh, profit
you, while you are Fools in the things of God, of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and Eternity! O Sirs! Think of this reasonable
service, without which, it had been better, that you
had never been born!</p>

                  <hi>O</hi> God, Great and Glorious, I have too long measur'd

which is most agreeable to thy holy Nature, and the interest of
my immortal Soul. O let thy Grace awaken my Reason, that
I may exercise my self for the future, more in things Spirtual,
and invisible! Thy Gospel is so true, The Miracles recorded
there so convincing, the Doctrine so weighty, the beauty of
Holiness so charming, thy promises so gracious, thy threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings

            <argument>
               <head>The CONTENTS.</head>
               <p>Want of Charity the great Cause of Men's separating
from a Church, sound in her Doctrines and Morals,
in point of Ceremonies. Essential Things, in the first
Institution of this Sacrament, must be separated from
Circumstantial. The Posture Christ used, was not Sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
but Leaning, or Lying on one Side. No Churches
ever used that Posture. Several Reasons, why Kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is the most proper Posture in Receiving. The
Prayer.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>I. IT is observed by <hi>Eusebius,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Euseb. Eccles. Hist. lib. 5. cap. 23.</note> that
when <hi>Polycarp,</hi> the famous Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> came to <hi>Rome,</hi> though
he differed from <hi>Anicetus,</hi> the Bishop of that See, in
Points of Ceremony, and Customs, he had received
from St. <hi>John,</hi> yet they communicated together; and
did not think it Christian-like, to break Communion
for any Difference in Things of that Nature. An ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Temper! and which I could wish had been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
by our Dissenting Brethren, who have been over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrupulous
about the Posture of Kneeling at the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Sacrament. 'Tis a lamentable thing, to see how
Men divide, and separate one from another in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
<pb n="595" facs="tcp:103387:304"/>
upon the Account of little External Formali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
and neglect the Substance, for a Circumstance;
and the great Duty of Charity, because the Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and Decencies of a Church are not modell'd
according to their Humour. What Account can such
Men give of themselves to God, who leave a Church,
by their own Confession, sound in Doctrines and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals,
for a few External Things, which are not agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to their Fancy? Is this a Cause, worth suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for? And can they imagine, that God will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
them for neglecting a greater Duty, for a less?
Into what Passion and Bitterness have some been trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported,
that they have even ventured to call this
Kneeling at the Communion, <hi>Idolatry</hi> and <hi>Superstition!</hi>
When the Children of <hi>Reuben, Josh. 22. 27.</hi> protest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that the Altar they had erected, was not for Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,
or Burnt-Offering, but only as a Witness that
they were part of the Tribes of <hi>Israel,</hi> the whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
of the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> acquiesced, and
were satisfied. Our Church protests publickly against
any Intent of Paying Adoration, by this Ceremony,
to the Consecrated Elements, which would make it
Idolatry; and yet so dis-ingenuous are some, that,
notwithstanding this Protestation, they fill both their
own, and other People's Heads with Fears, that Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery
and Idolatry may be hid under that fair Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side.
In which Proceedings, there is so little Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Ingenuity, that it is a Shame Men should
pretend to Conscience, and shew so little of it in their
Censures.</p>
            <p>II. That which hath betrayed too many into these
uncharitable Verdicts, hath been, their not distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing
betwixt the Essentials and Circumstantials
of this Sacrament; betwixt things barely related, and
commanded: And while they have thought themselves
obliged to keep exactly to every occasional Action,
or Gesture, used by Christ, but not commanded in
this Sacrament, they have led themselves and others
<pb n="596" facs="tcp:103387:305"/>
into very palpable Mistakes and Delusions. And
yet, when all is done, even these Persons that plead
against Kneeling at this Sacrament, under a Pretence
of keeping close to the Letter of Christ's Actions,
do at the same time neglect several Circumstances,
observed in the first Institution; for it was celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in an Upper Room, administred only to Twelve,
to Men, and not to Women, and at Night, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
None of which Circumstances are observed by these
Men. And if one Circumstance may be neglected,
why may not another, such as Sitting, be forborn?
That <hi>Christ</hi> and his Disciples sate at this Sacrament,
is the common Allegation; and we render the Greek
Words, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, by <hi>He sate down:</hi> And
the Reason why we render it so, is, because Sitting
comes nearer to the Posture <hi>Christ</hi> used, than Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or Kneeling. But any Man that is no Stranger,
either to Greek, or to the Custom of the <hi>Jews,</hi> must
needs know that these Words do properly import
<hi>Leaning,</hi> or <hi>Inclining,</hi> or <hi>Lying on one Side:</hi> And this
the <hi>Jews</hi> express by their <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as <hi>Sitting</hi> by <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
making a great Difference betwixt these two. This <hi>Lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
or <hi>Lying,</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> used at their Passover: Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they borrowed this Rite, or Posture, from the
<hi>Grecians, Romans</hi> and <hi>Persians,</hi> who used to Sup in
that Posture, I will not determine. But the manner
was this; they lean'd, or lay, on their Left Side,
upon little Beds, made for that purpose, called in
their Language, <gap reason="foreign">

and each Bed held three Persons. The Law had
commanded Standing at the Eating of the Passover;
but the Church looked upon that Posture, as Servile,
accommodated only to those Times, when they were
in <hi>Egypt;</hi> and therefore changed it into the Posture
of Leaning, which they thought was a Badge of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty:
Nor doth <hi>Christ</hi> find fault with their Church,
for making this Alteration in a commanded Posture;
for himself practised it; knowing that Circumstantial
Things are left to the Discretion of the Governors
<pb n="597" facs="tcp:103387:305"/>
of Churches, to keep or abolish them, as they shall
see convenient. And this was so universally believed
by all Churches of the Christian World, that none I
could ever hear or read of, hath kept to the posture
of Leaning, or Lying on one Side, in the Use of
this Holy Sacrament; which they would not have
presumed to do, if this Posture had been Essential to
the Receiving of the Sacrament. And whereas it is
commonly said, that this was a Table-posture, to which
Sitting succeeded; still this shews, that Men have
varied from the Posture, <hi>Christ</hi> used: And since he
hath commanded no Posture, all Churches are at their
liberty to order what Posture they think fit; and he
is a contentious Man that opposes it. What Posture
the Primitive Church used at the Receiving of the
Sacrament, Antiquity hath not left upon Record:
That they stood at their Publick Prayers on <hi>Sundays,</hi>
and on other Days too, from <hi>Easter</hi> to <hi>Whitsuntide,</hi>
we know; but whether they observed the same Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture
at the Sacrament, is uncertain; though if they
used Standing, still it was their Posture of Worship
and Adoration. St. <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> indeed, tells us, that
the Priests in his Time stood at the Altar, waiting
for Communicants; but how they received the Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bols,
he doth not mention. <hi>Dionysius</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi>
speaking of a Person unlawfully baptized, tells us, that
he stood at the Table of the Lord when he was to
Receive: But <hi>Ruffinus</hi> interprets that, of the Act, not
Gesture of Receiving; it being common among the
the Ancients, to express their Publick Worship, by
Standing, or Stations. 'Tis like, that when the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
had reproved the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> for not distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Lord's Table from their common Suppers,
in point of Reverence and Seriousness, the Christians
bethought themselves of a more humble and suitable
Posture, than they used at their common Meals.
There is no Man, I hope, so wicked, as to exclude
Prayers and Praises at the Receiving of the Holy
Symbols: And what can be a more proper Posture
<pb n="598" facs="tcp:103387:306"/>
for these Devotions, than Kneeling? Kneeling hath
in all Ages been accounted the proper Posture of
Prayers and Praises: And who can think of the Love
of God, represented to us in this Sacrament, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
them? And if these be proper and necessary here,
why should the humble Posture, in which they are
offered, be counted superstitious? The Heathens them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
have condemned Irreverence in the External
Performance of God's Service: And shall Pagans and
Infidels out do us in Humility of Worship? When<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
Sacrifices were offered heretofore, the Officer
bowed himself to his God: And shall we offer the
Sacrifice of Prayer and Thanksgiving to our Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
Redeemer, in this Sacrament, without bowing?
We come before God, in this Sacrament, as Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars,
as Sinners, as indigent Worms: And what can
be more suitable to Persons under those Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
than the humblest Postures? Here we come to
receive a Pardon from the Great King of Heaven:
And doth a Man receive a Pardon of a Temporal
King upon his Knees, and shall he refuse to receive
a Pardon of far greater Consequence, and of a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Prince too, in that Posture? We believe, that at
such Times we receive Christ into our Souls: And
shall our External Humility be less than the Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion's,
who did not think himself worthy that <hi>Christ</hi>
should come under his Roof? Or, if we have the
same Apprehensions of our own Unworthiness, shall
not we express them by proper External Postures?
Where the Soul hath a great Sense of the Love and
Gracious Presence of God, it will even force the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
into humble Postures: And it is to be feared,
where People are loth to kneel, they are Strangers
to this Sense in the Holy Sacrament. What is urged,
that Pope <hi>Honorius,</hi> in the Thirteenth Century, did
first bring in Kneeling at the Sacrament, is evidently
false; for, all that he ordered, was, that the Body
should be decently bowed, when the Holy Symbols
were lifted up by the Priest; which is nothing to
<pb n="599" facs="tcp:103387:306"/>
our Kneeling at the Sacrament. The Primitive
Church, though they do not mention Kneeling at
the Sacrament, yet they exhort their Hearers to Grief
and Sorrow, and Confessions, and an humble Sense
of Sin, in the Act of Receiving; and we may ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally
infer, that they did not do this with out
Kneeling, or Prostration. And since the Ancient
Writers make frequent mention of the Word <hi>Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
in Receiving, we cannot but conclude, that they
used a Posture proper, and expressive of that Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And why should we scruple to express our A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doration
of God, by Kneeling in this Sacrament,
when we see the Church Triumphant in Heaven, at
their singing the Praises of the Lamb that was slain,
fall down before the Lamb, and say, <hi>Worthy is the
Lamb, that was slain, to receive Power, and Riches, and
Wisdom, and Strength, and Honour, and Glory, and Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing;</hi>
as St. <hi>John</hi> informs us, <hi>Rev. 5. 8, 12.</hi>

                  <hi>O</hi> Thou Eternal Wisdom of the Father! Who being in
the Form of God, thoughtest it no Robbery to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
with God, but madest thy self of no Reputation, and
tookest upon thee the Form of a Servant, and wast made
in the Likeness of Men; and being found in Fashion, as
a Man, didst humble thy self, and becamest obedient unto
Death, even the Death of the Cross: Wherefore, God also
hath highly exalted thee, and given thee a Name, which
is above every Name; that at the Name of <hi>Jesus</hi> every
Knee should bow, of things in Heaven, and things in Earth,
and things under the Earth; and that eveey Tongue should
confess that <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> is Lord, to the Glory of God the
Father. O Lord of Glory! Over-awe both my Outward

that both may bow, and both may express their Gratitude.

Let my Body, as well as Soul, worship thee, love thee, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire

Image of the Invisible God, the First-born of every Creature;
for by thee were all things created that are in Heaven, and
that are in Earth; visible, and invisible; whether they be
Thrones, or Dominions, or Principalities, or Powers; all
things were created by thee, and for thee. To thee be Glory
for ever and ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>
