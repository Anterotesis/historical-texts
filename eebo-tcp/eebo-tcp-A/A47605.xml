         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Am not a little concerned to ſee how I am neceſſitated to write this Epiſtle, in Vindication of my ſelf from thoſe Aſperſions you have caſt upon me, in your late Book, called, <hi>An argumentative and practical Diſcourſe of Infant-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm</hi>; though not ſo much for my own Reputation, as to clear up to the World Matter of Fact, and free the Truth of Chriſt, (I mean his deſpiſed Ordinance) from that Reproach and Contempt you have caſt upon it. I know I meet with no worſe uſage from you, than my <hi>Lord and Maſter,</hi> (and many of his faithful Servants) did meet withal from others. The truth is, all impartial Men cannot but wonder when they hear and conſider of your undue Behaviour towards me; Firſt, in your ſtrange and unreaſonable Proceeding when you came in that unexpected and unſeemly manne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<q>Since the late general Liberty, the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> thinking themſelves thereby let looſe upon us, have diſperſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into ſeveral Counties, endeavouring to draw away our People from us, by perſwading them to renounce their firſt Dedication to God in Baptiſm, and to enter into their Communion after the way of Dipping, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Sir, Our Deſign in our Preaching to Goſpel, we can appeal to God and all the World, is to endeavour to draw Men from their Sins and ungodly Lives, and to believe in Chriſt to the Salvation of their Souls. They who have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended upon my Miniſtry, can witneſs what the Scope and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of my Preaching hath all along been. Can any ſay, that I ever preach'd up that Ordinance, which is our preſent Controverſy, till you preach'd it down, and caſt Reproach upon it, and on us for the Practice thereof? not that I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed to own that bleſſed Truth, or did not occaſionally mention it; but I had rather ſee one Sinner converted, than a hundred Perſons baptized who bring not forth Fruits meet for Repentance.</p>
            <p>But you proceed in your Epiſtle and ſay.

            </p>
            <p>Sir, I wonder how you come to publiſh ſuch a notorious Untruth to the World: it ſeems to me you neither regard your own R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I have got your whole Book anſwered: I ſent it to one whom I knew could better do it than my ſelf; not that I ſaw any thing in it, but that a Man of very mean Parts might have done it; but for ſome Reaſons, I thought it would be better for another to anſwer you at this time, than my ſelf.

                  <p>IT grieves and afflicts my very Soul to ſee ſuch <hi>Strifes, Animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities</hi> and <hi>Bitterneſs of Spirit</hi> amongſt Chriſtians, becauſe of that Difference there is amongſt us in reſpect of ſome Truths of Jeſus Chriſt, in a time when we are all threatned by the common Enemy. I am afraid it is the Fore-runner of a diſmal Hour which is coming upon us: But indeed, of all who have of late come forth againſt us, called <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> none have ſhewed a worſer Spirit than this Mr. <hi>Burkit,</hi> who writes himſelf Rector of <hi>Mildin</hi> in <hi>Suffolk:</hi> and that which troubles me the more, is what I have lately heard (by a worthy Gentleman) concerning him, <hi>i. e.</hi> That he is look'd upon as a <hi>ſober Perſon,</hi> and one alſo well affected to the preſent Government: would all his Brethren in that reſpect were like-minded. But in this Attempt of his, I know not what he aims at. Should we not all unite together in Love and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and ſtrive to promote Peace and Concord, and not tear one another in pieces after this manner? I am ſure this cannot tend to the Honour of God which he has done, nor to the Service of the Church or State: but we have been provoked by him to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate our ſelves, and therefore none who are unprejudiced can blame us. Should we ſuffer our ſelves to be loaded with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach and Infamy, and not endeavour (in a juſt way) to clear
<pb facs="tcp:44276:5"/>
our ſelves, and that Truth of Chriſt we are ſo well eſtabliſhed in, from the certain Teſtimony of the ſacred Scripture? and muſt we be expoſed (for making God's Word our only Rule herein) as a corrupt and erronious ſort of People, becauſe we affirm from thence, Believers only are the true Subjects of Baptiſm, and that Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing is Dipping, and not Rantiſing; eſpecially ſince ('tis well known) in all the Articles of Religion we are acknowledged to be ſound and <hi>orthodox,</hi> and that by our Adverſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>And now to you my Brethren, who own this deſpiſed Truth of Chriſt, <hi>viz.</hi> The Baptiſm of Believers; let me give you one Cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>i. e.

                  <p>Reader, there are two things I would deſire thee to note; <hi>Firſt,</hi> That I have repeated ſome of my Anſwers to Mr. <hi>Burkit</hi> often; partly becauſe he repeats the ſame Arguments, and partly becauſe I would indeavour to make it clearly to appear, that many, or moſt of his Arguments he brings to prove <hi>Infants ought to be baptized,</hi> do as fully, and as apparently tend to prove <hi>Infants ought to receive the Lord's Supper</hi>; therefore I have drawn al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt upon every like Occaſion, the ſame Inferences for that, as he hath for the other; which I intreat you to conſider well of.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly</hi>; Whereas you will find both <hi>Hebrew, Greek, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin, German, Dutch,</hi> (as well as <hi>Engliſh</hi>) made uſe of (o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more or leſs,) in the inſuing Anſwer.

                  </p>
                  <p n="1">(1.) Circumciſion was a Shadow of Chriſt to come: Baptiſm is a Sign he is already come, was dead and buried.</p>
                  <p n="2">(2.) Circumciſion was a Sign of the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his natural Seed: Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm is a Sign of the peculiar ſpiritual Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges made to Saints, as ſuch, and no others.</p>
                  <p n="3">(3.) Circumciſion was a Domeſtick Action, <hi>i.e.</hi> to be done in the Houſe: Baptiſm an Eccleſiaſtick, belonging to the Goſpel-Church.</p>
                  <p n="4">(4.) Circumciſion was to be done by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents in that reſpect: Baptiſm is to be done only by Goſpel-Miniſters.</p>
                  <p n="5">(5.) Circumciſion was the cutting off the Fore-skin of the Fleſh, which drew Blood: Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm is to be done by dipping the whole Body into the Water without drawing of any Blood.</p>
                  <p n="6">(6.) Circumciſion belonged to Male Children only: Baptiſm belongs to Males and Females alſo.</p>
                  <p n="7">(7.) Circumciſion was to be done preciſely on the eighth day: Baptiſm is not limited to any preciſe day.</p>
                  <p n="8">(8.) Circumciſion made a viſible Impreſſion on the Body, which the Party might perceive when he came to Age of Underſtanding: Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm leaves no Impreſſion on the Body.</p>

                  <p n="11">(11.) If Circumciſion ſignified the ſame things, and conſequently, particularly the ſealing the Covenant of Grace; then thoſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <p n="12">(12.) Circumciſion ſignified the taking away the Sins of the Fleſh, or the Circumciſion of the Heart: but Baptiſm ſignifies the Death, Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial, and Reſurrection of Chriſt, which Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion did not.</p>
                  <p n="13">(13.) Circumciſion was to be a Partition-Wall betwixt Jew and Gentile; but Baptiſm teſtifieth that Jew and Gentile, Male and Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male; <hi>Barbarian</hi> and <hi>Scythian,</hi> Bond and Fr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Where are we forbid to baptize Bells, and conſecrate Water, as the Papiſts do to make it holy Water? Alſo where are Infants excluded from the Lord's-Table? If therefore any thing may be done in God's Worſhip, which you ſuppoſe is not forbid, and bears alſo ſome proportion in Signification with Jewiſh Rites; all Popiſh Rites and Ceremonies may be let in at the ſame Door: for the <hi>Pope, Miter,</hi> Popiſh Veſtures, Candle and Candleſticks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they no doubt will tell you are of like Signification with the High-Prieſt under the Law, with the Prieſt's

                  <p>But to proceed; we will come to that grand Proof of yours for Infant Baptiſm in <hi>Pag.</hi> 4. which you intimate will put the Matter out of all diſpute; namely,
<q>That Baptiſm doth come in the room of Circumciſion, which is <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 11, 12. <hi>In whom alſo ye are circumciſed, with the Circumciſion made without Hands, by the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion of Chriſt; buried with him in Baptiſm.</hi> You ſay, The Deſign of the Apoſtle here is to take the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> off from the old Sacrament of Circumciſion. He informs them that there was no reaſon why they ſhould be fond of it, becauſe they were compleat without it, Chriſt having ſubſtituted new Circumciſion in the room of it, namely, Baptiſm: and accordingly Chriſtians may now be ſaid, by Baptiſm, to be ſpiritually circumciſed, as the Jews were ſaid to be ſpiritually baptized.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Your Expoſition of this Text, there is no ground to admit of; the Apoſtle ſpeaks of the Power or Virtue of Chriſt's Circumciſion. His deſign is to ſhew we are compleat in Chriſt without Circumciſion, or Jewiſh Ordinances: and to ſhew how we are compleat in Chriſt, and have put him on, he mentions Faith as well as Baptiſm, or ſuch a Faith that ſhould always at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend Baptiſm; and therefore Infant-Baptiſm from hence cannot be proved or inferred, nor the leaſt ground for your bold Concluſion from hence, <hi>viz.</hi> That Baptiſm came in the room of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For firſt, the Apoſtle 'tis true excludes Circumciſion, but 'tis upon another account, <hi>viz.</hi> by ſhewing Circumciſion was a Figure of the Circumciſion of the Heart, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 28, 29. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.3. and ſince they had the thing ſignified
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:44276:9"/>
thereby, the Rite or Sign ceaſed. And as I have lately replied to ſome of your Brethren in anſwer to this Text, ſo I muſt ſay to you, all that can well be aſſerted from this Scripture, where the Apoſtle brings in Baptiſm, is no more than this, <hi>viz.</hi> That where Baptiſm is rightly admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred upon a proper Subject, it repreſents the ſpiritual and myſtical Circumciſion of the Heart, <hi>i. e.</hi> that <hi>the Soul is dead to Sin, or hath put off the Body of the Sins of the Fleſh by the Circumciſion of Chriſt</hi>; which may refer to the Power of his Death in the bleſſed Effects thereof, by the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual Sin-killing Operations of the Spirit on the Heart. And as being dead to Sin, we are buried with Chriſt in Baptiſm, both in ſign and token of Chriſt's Burial, <hi>i. e.</hi> covered all over in the Water, which is a clear Symbol of his Burial; alſo in Signification, <hi>i. e.</hi> that we being dead and buried with Chriſt in Baptiſm, ſo are to riſe with him, by the Faith of the Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of God; and both theſe are held forth in true Baptiſm. The Apoſtle doth not mention Baptiſm to come in the room of Circumciſion, but to ſhew that theſe believing <hi>Coloſſians</hi> had through Chriſt by the Spirit obtained the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>type thereof, or thing figured out in the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion of the Fleſh; which Baptiſm did clearly repreſent. But ſince this is ſo ſtrenuouſly urged by you afreſh, tho ſo often anſwered, I will be at the trouble to tranſcribe once more what Dr. <hi>Taylor,</hi> late Biſhop of <hi>Down,</hi> hath ſaid to this Argument of yours, and others before you, about Circumciſion, <hi>viz.</hi> That Baptiſm is the Antitype of it, or that it came in the room thereof.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>The Argument (ſaith he) from Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion is invalid upon infinite Conſiderations, Figures and Types prove nothing, unleſs a Command go along with them, or ſome Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs

to ſignify ſuch to be their purpoſe. For the Deluge of Waters and Ark of <hi>Noah</hi> were Figures of Baptiſm, ſaith <hi>Peter.</hi> If therefore the Circumſtances of the one be drawn to the other, we ſhall make Baptiſm a Prodigy ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than a Rite; The Paſchal Lamb was a Figure of the Euchariſt, which ſucceeds the other, as Baptiſm doth Circumciſion: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there was in the Mandu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>o Preſcription of Sacramental Drink, ſhall we conclude from hence, the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt is to be adminiſtered in one kind? To which let me add, Becauſe Children, Servants, and all in the Houſe <note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>Exod. 12.3, 4.</hi> They were to take to them a Lamb, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the number of Souls in the Houſe.</note> might eat of the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, muſt our Children and all in our Houſes eat of the Euchariſt, or Supper of the Lord? But, ſaith the Doctor, and in this very In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of this Argument, ſuppoſe a Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of the Analogy between Circumciſion and Baptiſm, yet there is no Correſpondency of Identity; for though it be granted, that both of them did conſign the Covenant of Faith, yet there is nothing in the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of Children being circumciſed, that ſo concerns that Myſtery, but that it might well be given to Men of Reaſon, becauſe Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion left a Character in the Fleſh, which being imprinted upon the Infant, did its work to them when they came to Age; and ſuch a Character was neceſſary, becauſe there was no word added to the Sign: But Baptiſm imprints nothing that remains on the Body; and if it leaves a Character at all, it is upon the Soul, to which the Word is added, which is as much a part of the Sacrament as the Sign it ſelf: for both which Reaſons it is requiſite, that the Party baptized ſhould be capable of Reaſon, that they may be capable both of the Word and of the Sacrament, and the impreſs upon the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:44276:10"/>
Spirit. Since therefore the Reaſon of the Parity does wholly fail, there is nothing left to infer a neceſſity of complying in the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance of Age, any more than in the other Annexes of Types. The Infant muſt alſo preciſely be baptized upon the eighth day, and Females muſt not be baptized at all, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe not circumciſed. But it were more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, if we would underſtand it aright, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute the Analogy from the Type to the Antitype, by the way of Letter, and Spirit, and Signification, and as Circumciſion figures Baptiſm, ſo alſo the Adjuncts of the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed ſhall ſignify ſomething ſpiritual in the Adherents of Baptiſm: and therefore as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants were circumciſed, ſo ſpiritual Infants ſhould be baptized, which is ſpiritual Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion; for therefore Babes had the Miniſtry of the Type, to ſignify that we muſt, when we give our Names to Chriſt, become Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in Malice, and then the Type is made compleat.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus, as I have formerly ſaid; the worthy Doctor hath given you a full Anſwer to all you have ſaid concerning your Arguments for Baptiſm coming in the room of, or being a Figure of Circumciſion. But to proceed.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. If Baptiſm and Circumciſion were both in full force together for ſome time; then Baptiſm is not the Type of, nor came in the room of Circumciſion.</p>
                  <p>But Baptiſm and Circumciſion were both in full force together for ſome time: Therefore Baptiſm is no Type of, nor came in the room of Circumciſion.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> is undeniable. Was not Baptiſm in full force from the time that <hi>John</hi> received it from Heaven, and adminiſtred it on the People? and did not Chriſt, by the hands of his Diſciples,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:44276:11"/>
baptize many Perſons? nay, more Diſciples than <hi>John?</hi> as it is ſaid, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.1, 2. And was not Circumciſion them in full force too, and ſo abode till Chriſt took it away by nailing it, with all other Jewiſh Rites, to his Croſs?</p>
                  <p>And as to the ſequel of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Major,</hi> that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denied; for if one thing cannot come in the room and, place of another, till the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is actually and legally removed and took out of the way, which is plain; then ſince theſe two Rites had a Being together, the <hi>Major</hi> is undeniable. A Type can abide no longer than till the Antitype is come; therefore Baptiſm is not the Antitype of Circumciſion, or came not in the room and place thereof; the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>type of which, or that which came in the room of the Circumciſion of the Fleſh, is the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion of the Heart, <hi>not in the Fleſh; but in the Spirit, whoſe Praiſe is not of Men, but of God.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> This Argument ſuppoſeth Baptiſm to ſucceed in the place of Circumciſion;<note place="margin">Mr <hi>Tomb</hi>'s Anſwer.</note> which may be underſtood many ways.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. So as that the ſenſe be, that thoſe Perſons may be Baptized, which heretofore, by God's Appointment, were to be Circumciſed. And in this ſenſe the Argument muſt proceed, if it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude to the purpoſe: But in this ſenſe it is falſe, for Females were not Circumciſed, which yet were Baptized, as <hi>Act.</hi> 8.12, 13, 14. &amp; 16.14, 15. and Believers out of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Houſe, as <hi>Lot, Melchiſedec, Joh,</hi> were not to be Circumciſed: but believing Gentiles are univerſally to be Baptized.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It may be ſo underſtood as if the Rite of Baptiſm then began, when the Rite of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion did or was to end. But this is not to be ſaid; for <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> and Chriſt's Diſciples bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, <hi>John</hi> 4.1, 2. before Circumciſion of right ceaſed.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It may be underſtood, as if Baptiſm did ſucceed into the place of Circumciſion, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of its ſignification; which is true in ſome things, but not in others.

                     </gap> may be concluded out of that place alledged, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.11, 12. To which I think meet to add, that if that Text be looked into, the Apoſtle ſpeaks not of any Circumciſion, but of Chriſt,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:44276:12"/>
becauſe in him we are compleat, and by whoſe Circumciſion we are ſaid to put off the Body of the Sins of the Fleſh: nor doth the Text ſay we are Circumciſed, becauſe we are Baptized; but that we are compleat in Chriſt, becauſe we are Circumciſed in him, <hi>and buried with him in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,</hi> (in which) <hi>or in whom ye and alſo riſen toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, through the Faith of the Operation of God that raiſed him from the Dead.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In ſome things Baptiſm doth not ſucceed into the place of Circumciſion, in reſpect of ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
                  <p>For, 1. Circumciſion did ſignify Chriſt to come of <hi>Iſaac</hi> according to the Fleſh, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.10, 11. but Baptiſm doth not ſignify this, but points at his Incarnation, Death and Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Circumciſion was a Sign, that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were a People ſeparated from all Nations, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.1. but Baptiſm ſignifies, that all that believe, whether <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gentiles,</hi> are one in Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.28.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Circumciſion ſignified, that <hi>Moſes</hi> his Law was to be obſerved, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.3. but Baptiſm doth ſignify, that <hi>Moſes</hi> his Law is aboliſhed, and the Doctrine of Chriſt eſtabliſhed.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Circumciſion ſignified the Promiſe of the Land of <hi>Canaan:</hi> but Baptiſm Eternal Life by Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>And indeed, ſaith he, if this Argument be not warily and reſtrainedly underſtood, an Egg is laid, out of which manifeſt <hi>Judaiſm</hi> may be hatched; but if it be taken reſtrainedly, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

we infer any Rite to be inſtituted in their ſtead, reſpecting the ſame Perſons; yea verily, it is to be ſeriouſly thought on,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That by ſuch Arguments drawn from <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logies,</hi> not conceived by the Holy Ghoſt, but drawn out of our Wit, a new kind of inſtituting Rites (to wit, from Analogies) is brought in, beſides our Lord's Precepts, and the Apoſtles Examples.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This being once ſaid, by a like parity of Reaſon and Arguing, it will be lawful to bring into the Chriſtian Church, under other Names and Forms, the whole Burden of <hi>Jewiſh Rites</hi>; yea, almoſt out of what you will, to conclude what you will. For who ſhall put a Bound to Mens feigning Analogies, when they go beyond the Lord's Precepts, and the Apoſtles Examples? It is well known, that the Divine Appointment of Tythes to be paid, and many other things in the Writings of Divines, are aſſerted by this kind of Argument, beſides the Rule of the Lord's Precept, and the Apoſtles Example.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Hereby will the Opinion of the Papiſts be confirmed; who affirm, from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.11. the Sacraments of the Jews, to be Types of the Sacraments of Chriſtians; which is rejected by Divines that diſpute againſt <hi>Bellarmine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. This manner of arguing, will countenance the Arguments of the Papiſts for an <hi>

Yea, what hindereth, but we may give Children the Lord's Supper, if we ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue this way, ſince <hi>Samuel,</hi> Jeſus Chriſt under

Age, were partakers of the Paſſeover?

Leſt any Man take this for a light Suggeſtion, I will add, that grave, godly, and learned Men, have often warned, that we are to take heed, that we do not raſhly frame Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from Analogy; among others, in their late Writings in the Engliſh Tongue, <hi>John Paget,</hi> in his <hi>Defence of Church-Government,</hi> Part 1.

                  <p>Laſtly, It is to be conſidered, again and again, how by theſe Argumentations, the Conſciences of Men may be freed from the danger of Will-Worſhip, and polluting ſo remarkable an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Chriſt as Baptiſm is; eſpecially this Care lies on them, who by Prayer, Sermons, Writings, Covenants and Oaths, do deter Chriſtians from Humane Inventions in God's Worſhip diligently, and it is to be hoped ſincerely.</p>

                  <p>That there was an expreſs Command in ſo many Words for Circumciſion, but there is no ſuch Command for Infant-Baptiſm. <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.9, requires Infants to be Circumciſed; ſhew us but ſuch a Text in all the New Teſtament, that ſays, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:44276:13"/>
our Objection, to which you give a threefold Anſwer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>I acknowledg (ſay you) that in the New-Teſtament, though it be not wholly ſilent, yet it ſpeaks very little touching the Caſe of Infant-Baptiſm; and that for two Reaſons, 1. Becauſe the Old-Teſtament ſpeaks ſo much in their Caſe, therefore the New-Teſtament ſpeaks ſo little—The Old-Teſtament plainly informs us, that Children in their Infancy were admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Members of the Viſible Church. Now what need is there that the ſame thing be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated over again in the New-Teſtament? for it is not the Old-Teſtament alone, nor the New-Teſtament alone, but both together, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Rule of Faith and Practice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. You ſpeak an Untruth, for the New-Teſtament ſpeaks nothing at all touching Infant-Baptiſm; if a Man read it over a thouſand times, he ſhall not find one Word, or the leaſt Hint given of it: therefore the New-Teſtament, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to what you boldly affirm, is wholly ſilent in the Caſe of Infant-Baptiſm and Church-Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſhip. 'Tis a ſhame for a Man, who calls him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a Miniſter, to ſpeak falſly, but much more to publiſh Falſhoods to the World. In this, Mr. Rector, you muſt be corrected. If you fly to your pretended Conſequences, you ſhall find, by and by, God aſſiſting, that that Refuge will fail you in the Caſe; for Conſequences in many Caſes, drawn naturally from the Premiſes to which they refer, we readily admit of, though not in the Caſe of meer poſitive Precepts.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As to your firſt Reaſon, why the New-Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament ſpeaks no more in the Caſe of Infants; which is, as you conceive, becauſe the Old-Teſtament ſpeaks ſo much, that the Infant-Seed of Believers ſhould be owned as Covenant Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, as <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.10, 12. and were admitted
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:44276:14"/>
Members of that Viſible Church. I muſt tell you, <hi>Sir,</hi> by way of Anſwer, this will do you no good, for the Reaſons following.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe Baptiſm is (as I have told you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready) a meer poſitive Precept; and the Rite thereof, as well as Circumciſion, cannot be known but by the expreſs Declaration or Manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation of the Will and Mind <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> God in his written Word. <hi>Abraham</hi> knew not that it was his Duty, he ought to Circumciſe his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, till God gave him his poſitive and expreſs Command to do it; and then alſo it was none but his Male Children; and God gave Directions to him, when and wherefore he ſhould Circumciſe them: And therefore there is the ſame parity of Reaſon, why the Great God ſhould give us under the Goſpel the like poſitive Law for baptizing our Children under the Goſpel; together with the Time when, and the Reaſon wherefore, as he did to them in the caſe of Circumciſion, had it been his Pleaſure we ſhould Baptize our Children: but ſince he hath not required any thing of this Nature of us under the Goſpel, his requiring them to Circumciſe their Male Children, will not juſtify us, nor free us in ſo doing, from pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable Will-Worſhip. Were there none among the Gentiles, think you, in the Old-Teſtament-time, that were Believers and Godly Perſons? And if there were ſuch, I ask you, whether they were to Circumciſe their Children, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they abode without the Gate or Pale of the Jewiſh Church? Nay, I affirm, that it was not the Duty of <hi>Melchiſedec, Lot,</hi> nor <hi>Job,</hi> (becauſe not <hi>Abraham</hi>'s natural Off-ſpring, nor bought with his Money, had they never ſo many Sons) to Circumciſe one of them, becauſe they had no Command ſo to do. Read <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.8, 9, 10, 11. and you will find the expreſs Command of God was to him, and to every Male-Child of his; or
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:44276:14"/>
that was born in his Houſe, or bought with Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, <hi>ver.</hi> 11, 12.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe the Church-State of the Jews, or that under the Old-Teſtament, quite differs from the Goſpel-Church State; the Jewiſh-Church-Conſtitution was National, the whole Nation of the Jews; and every individual Perſon that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Loins, were admitted as Members of that Church under the Law, or in Times of the Old-Teſtament, and therefore his Infant-Seed were and might be admitted Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers thereof. But in the Times of the Goſpel, the Church is not National, but Congregational, Shew us what whole Nation or People, none ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, were by Chriſt's Appointmen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as a Goſpel-Church, as the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> or Jewiſh Nation were, and you will gain a great Point. Is it not evident, all along in the <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles,</hi> which gives an Account of the Nature and Manner of the Gatherings and Conſtitutions of the Goſpel-Churches, that they conſiſted of none but of ſuch who profeſſed Faith and Regeneration, and ſo were either ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered out of the Jewiſh People, or elſe out of the Nations of the Gentiles, and conſiſted of no other but ſuch who were called, or did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs Faith in Jeſus Chriſt? Which if conſidered, utterly overthrows, not only what you ſpeak here, but all you ſpeak afterwards about Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren being once in Covenant under the Law.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Whereas you ſay,
<q>It is not the Old-Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment alone, nor the New-Teſtament, but both together, that contains the Rule of our Faith and Practice.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer, That though in part what you ſay here is true, yet your Trumpet gives an uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Sound: for in reſpect of Practice, were there not many Laws and Precepts given to the People of the Jews, which no ways in the leaſt concern
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:44276:15"/>
us, or God's Spiritual <hi>Iſrael</hi> under the Goſpel? If you explain your ſelf no better, you may ſoon ſubvert the People, and carry them away to <hi>Judaiſm</hi> with a witneſs: nay, and inſtead of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing Children upon ſuch a childiſh and errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Foot of Account, make them think they ought to Circumciſe them, as ſome of late here in <hi>England</hi> were deluded to do. Therefore we ſay as to all Precepts of the Goſpel that are meer poſitive Laws, the New-Teſtament is our only Rule without the help of the Old: Chriſt alone is our Law-giver, and him, and not <hi>Moſes,</hi> we are only to hear and hearken unto; though as to matter of Faith, the Old-Teſtament may be uſeful <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> us in many reſpects, and alſo all Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts that are purely Moral in their own Nature. The Old-Teſtament is a Rule to us as well as the New, which I might ſhew in many reſpects, not only touching the Law of the <hi>Decalogue,</hi> but alſo of <hi>Prayer, ſinging God's Praiſes, Faſting Days,</hi> &amp;c. But for you to intimate in the caſe of Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that the Old-Teſtament is a Rule of Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, or in reſpect of Jewiſh Church-Member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, you ſtrangely betray your Ignorance, as will further appear hereafter. For that Circumciſion was a meer Legal or Jewiſh Rite, I ſhall evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly anon fully prove. But ſo much as to your firſt Reaſon, your Second ſhall be now exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined.</p>
                  <p n="2">2.
<q>So little is ſaid (ſay you) in the New-Teſtament about Baptizing Infants, becauſe the cuſtom of Baptizing them was common, and the practice conſtant in the Jewiſh Church, at and before our Saviour's Time. Whilſt Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion was the Covenanting Sign, Baptiſm was the Purifying Ceremony among the Jews; for when any of the Gentiles were admitted into the Jewiſh Church, both Parents and Children were firſt Circumciſed, and then Waſh'd, in token
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:44276:15"/>
of cleanſing them from the filth of their Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſm: So that Baptiſm among the Jews con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly went along with Circumciſion till our Saviour's Time.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. 'Tis a ſign of a bad Cauſe, when Men are forc'd to try their Wits after ſuch a ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous manner, to make out what they have to prove. Pray, was that Cuſtom among the Jews, of Baptizing Infants, when any of the Gentiles were admitted into the Jewiſh Church, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of God? Had God given the Jews any ſuch Law or Precept? or was it not one of their own Traditions, who in their own Wiſdom, without any Warrant from their great Prophet and Law-giver, deviſed that Ceremony, poſſibly to waſh away the Filth of Heatheniſm, as your Predeceſſors in like manner, without any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand or Warrant of Jeſus Chriſt, deviſed the Baptizing of Infants, to waſh away the Filth of Original Sin? Doth not our bleſſed Saviour ſay, that <hi>they had made void the Commandments of God through their Traditions?</hi> I do affirm, it was never given them as a Law or Precept by the Great God, nor do you attempt once to prove any ſuch thing; for there is not the leaſt ſhadow of any ſuch thing in all the Old-Teſtament; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was a meer humane Tradition.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Can any wiſe Man, who would do nothing in God's Service without a ſufficient Rule or Warrant from the Word of God, think this a good Argument for Infant-Baptiſm?

Sure the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the latter is as good as the former.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But is it ſo indeed, did our Saviour ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Infant-Baptiſm? or, as you hint, leave ſo little of it in the New Teſtament, becauſe it was the conſtant Cuſtom among the Jews to baptize the Children of Heathens before they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted them into their Church? What Dr. <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond, Taylor</hi> and <hi>Lightfoot</hi> have ſaid upon that account, is to their Shame and Reproach, rather than to their Honour; tho I know it was their laſt Refuge, when they ſaw your Scripture-Proofs would not prove it to be a Truth of Chriſt. O how are we beholden to the Jewiſh Talmud, and Jewiſh Rabbins for our Infant-Baptiſm! Nay, which is worſt of all, how is Chriſt beholden to them for that rare Invention, that had ſaid ſo much for it, and made it ſo common a Practice among them, that it ſaved him the Pains to give the leaſt Directions about it? But is not this next to Blaſphemy? Can any Man in his right Wits think our Lord Jeſus ſhould confirm a vile Tradition and Innovation of the Jews? or take His great Ordinance and Sacrament of Baptiſm from the ſuperſtitious, fabulous and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronious Cuſtom of their Doctors and Rabbins? Beſides, was Baptiſm to be preached or practiſed by none but the Jewiſh People? doth it not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Gentiles too? Did not our Saviour command his Diſciples to go into all Nations, and make Diſciples and baptize them? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Was it his Mind that Infants ſhould be baptized, and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:44276:16"/>
yet ſay nothing of it, becauſe it was a common Cuſtom and Practice among the Jews? But, Sir, what muſt the Gentiles do to know this to be their Duty? (I mean thoſe Gentiles who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Chriſtian Faith) <hi>viz.</hi> that they ought to baptize their Children, who did not know nor ever heard of that Jewiſh Cuſtom? Or, dare you ſay, our New Teſtament is not authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, or ſufficient to teach us the whole of Goſpel-Duties and Obedience, without the Jewiſh Talmud? You ſhould not ('tis plain) only have ſaid the New Teſtament is not, without the Old, the Rule of our Practice; but alſo that the New Teſtament and the Old, without the Jewiſh Talmud, is not ſufficient, and then you had done your buſineſs at once. Are you not aſhamed thus to go about to blind and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the poor People?</p>
                  <p>Is not the whole Mind of Jeſus Chriſt, even all his Laws and Precepts, or his whole Counſel plainly contained in his bleſſed Word? But would you have People be wiſe above what is written, and teach Men to reflect upon the Care and Faithfulneſs of the bleſſed Jeſus, in leaving out of the ſacred Bible one great Truth of God, and leave us to find it out by going to ſearch the Jewiſh Traditions?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If it was a Cuſtom among the Jews, it muſt be a ſacred Cuſtom, I mean a Cuſtom that God appointed and commanded them to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, or elſe a human Tradition or vain Cuſtom: If it had been a Moſaical Rite given by God himſelf to the Jews, Chriſt beſure aboliſhed it, and nailed it to his Croſs, with all its fellows, and 'tis gone for ever ſince he hath not given it out a new.</p>
                  <p>Take this Argument.</p>
                  <p>That Cuſtom among the Jews that God never commanded, nor is any where given by <hi>Moſes</hi>
                     <pb n="24" facs="tcp:44276:17"/>
unto them, who was faithful in all his Houſe, was no Ordinance of God, but a meer human Tradition. But the Cuſtom among the Jews of baptizing the Heathen and their Children, who were admitted into their Church, was never commanded of God, nor any where given unto them by <hi>Moſes,</hi> who was faithful in all his Houſe. <hi>Ergo,</hi> That Cuſtom was no Ordinance of God, but a meer human Tradition.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Laſtly, take what a worthy and learned Author of your own Communion hath ſaid in Confutation of this fooliſh and abſurd Argument for Pedo-baptiſm, 'tis Sir <hi>Norton Knatchbull</hi> Knight and Baronet.
<q>The thing, ſaith he, is uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that it cannot be ſaid of the Rabbins, that there were not ſeveral among them who differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed very much about this matter; for <hi>Rabbi Eliezar</hi> expreſly contradicts <hi>Rabbi Joſhua,</hi> who was the firſt that I know of who aſſerted this ſort of Baptiſm among the Jews; for <hi>Rabbi Eliezar,</hi> who was contemporary with <hi>Rabbi Joſhua,</hi> if he did not live before him, aſſerts that a Proſelyte circumciſed, and not baptized, was a true Proſelyte; for ſo we read of the Patriarchs <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> that they were circumciſed, but not baptized. But <hi>Rabbi Joſhua</hi> affirms, that he who was baptized, not he that was circumciſed, was a true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelyte. To whom ſhall I give Credit, to <hi>Eliezar,</hi> who aſſerts what the Scripture confirms; or to <hi>Joſhua,</hi> who affirms what is no where to be found in Scripture? But the Rabbins upheld <hi>Joſhuah</hi>'s ſide, and what wonder was it? for it made for their buſineſs; that is, for the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Jewiſh Religion, that the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans ſhould borrow their Ceremonies from them. But when I ſee Men of great Learning in theſe times fetching the Foundations of Truth from the <hi>Rabbins,</hi> I cannot but heſitate a little:
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:44276:17"/>
For whence was the Talmud ſent us, they are the words of <hi>Buxtorf</hi> in his <hi>Synagoga Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daica,</hi> that we ſhould give Credit thereto, that from thence we ſhould believe that the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> either can or ought to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood? much leſs the Goſpel, to which they were profeſs'd Enemies. For the <hi>Talmud</hi> is called a Labyrinth of Errors, and the Foundation of Jewiſh Fables; it was brought to Perfection and held for authentick five hundred Years after Chriſt: therefore it is unreaſonable to reſt upon the Teſtimony of it. And that which moves me moſt, <hi>Joſephus</hi> (to omit all the Fathers that lived before the Talmud was finiſhed) who was a <hi>Jew,</hi> and contemporary with <hi>Rabbi Eliezar,</hi> who alſo wrote in particular of the Rites, Cuſtoms and Acts of the Jews, is altogether ſilent in this matter. So that it is an Argument to me next to a Demonſtration, that two ſuch eminent Perſons, both Jews, and living at the ſame time, the one ſhould poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively deny, and the other makes mention of Baptiſm among the Jews. Beſides, if Baptiſm in the modern ſenſe were in uſe among the Jews in ancient Times, why did the Phariſees ask <hi>John Baptiſt, Why doeſt thou baptize, if thou art not Chriſt, nor</hi> Elias, <hi>nor that Prophet?</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Joh. 1.25.</note> do they not plainly intimate that Baptiſm was not in uſe before, and that it was a received Opinion among them, that there ſhould be no Baptiſm till either Chriſt, or <hi>Elias,</hi> or that Prophet came?</q>
So far the renowned Sir <hi>Norton Knatchbull,</hi> in his Notes printed at <hi>Oxford, Anno Dom.</hi> 1677. with the Licenſe of the Vice-Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor, a very learned Man, and a Son of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Sir, what think you now of your Jewiſh Cuſtom, of baptizing the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens and their Children who were admitted to their Church? Do you think there is not need
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:44276:18"/>
that Infant-Baptiſm ſhould be mentioned in the holy Scripture, had it been a Truth? Is this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain Story of the Jewiſh Cuſtom ſufficient for you to build your Faith and Practice upon, when the Truth of the Story, as to matter of Fact, may juſtly be doubted? but if it was true, it is but a rotten Foundation to build one of the great Sacraments of Chriſt upon, <hi>viz.</hi> a vile, profane and human Tradition of the Jewiſh Rabbins.</p>
                  <p>I have been the larger on this matter, becauſe the Men you mention, as Dr. <hi>Hammond, Taylor</hi> and <hi>Lightfoot,</hi> ſome People have in ſuch Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, who were the Perſons (you need not doubt) the learned Sir <hi>Norton</hi> confuted; and alſo becauſe your Brethren the <hi>Athenian Society</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">The Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian Society detected in their <hi>12</hi> Numbers to their fifth Volume.</note>, notwithſtanding I have lately ſo fully anſwered all they have urged upon this account, ſtill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt upon this ridiculous Argument, as appears by their 12 Numbers to their fifth Volume. And what I have now ſaid, may ſerve for a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Anſwer to them as well as to you; but if we hear any more of this, we ſhall further ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe you and them than yet we have done.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Pag. 6.</hi> you ſeem to anſwer a Queſtion, <hi>viz. Why our Saviour did not particularly name Infants when he inſtituted Baptiſm in the room of Circumciſion?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Your Anſwer is, becauſe there was no occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for it;
<q>What need, ſay you, our Saviour declare that Infants ought to have the Seal of the Covenant applied to them, when it was never denied them? it had been highly requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite that our Saviour ſhould have particularly named them now: but being all ways inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded before, if our Saviour had intended their Excluſion now, he would moſt certainly have declared it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="27" facs="tcp:44276:18"/>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. I anſwer, you ſay the Seal of the Covenant was never denied Infants, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what need our Saviour particularly name Infants when he inſtituted Baptiſm? Sir, but did not our Saviour know there would be juſt ground for us to deny Infant-Baptiſm, ſince he commanded none in the great Commiſſion to be baptized, but ſuch who were made Diſciples by being firſt taught? And he being God as well as Man, did know from hence it would be denied, as it has been by ſome godly Chriſtians from the firſt time it was, as an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Device, introduced into God's Worſhip (as hereafter we ſhall prove): ſure this being ſo, there was all the reaſon imaginable that he ſhould ſpeak of their Baptiſm in his great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, had it been his Will they ſhould be baptized.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And why ſhould the baptizing of Believers be ſo clearly and ſo often ſpoken of in the New Teſtament, if a being in the Covenant was a ſufficient ground to baptize them, without a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive Precept, or expreſs Command to baptize them? ſince they were always from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the World look'd upon and known be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond doubt to be in Covenant: and ſo you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay of Infants, (tho you ſay the Seal was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver denied them) for there is no mention of their being in Covenant, as to have any Sign or Rite aſſigned them of it till <hi>Abraham</hi>'s days; and that that Covenant then, <hi>viz.</hi> of Circumciſion, was not a Covenant of Grace, we ſhall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, God aſſiſting, clearly prove. Therefore, ſay you what you pleaſe, there was more need for our Saviour to have Infants Baptiſm, and Church-Memberſhip particularly mentioned, than that of Believers, had it been the Mind of Chriſt they ought to be baptized and made Members of the Goſpel-Church.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="28" facs="tcp:44276:19"/>3. Beſides, the Diſpenſation of the Goſpel requires it, ſince it differs in Nature, Rites and Priviledges from that of the Law, or under the Old Teſtament. The Church-State of the Jews being National, and that of the Goſpel Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gational, had Chriſt only confirmed old Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-Rites and manner of Priviledges, Member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Initiations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> there might be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in what you ſay; but evident it is, that the Matter and Form, Rites and Priviledges of the Goſpel-Church, according to the Conſtitution, Laws and Ordinances of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Here the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenian So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety may ſee their firſt Query fully anſwered, of Infants be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once in Covenant, and never caſt out, are in ſtill.</note> quite differ, and are of another ſort to thoſe of the Law. <hi>Think not to ſay within your ſelves, We have</hi> Abraham <hi>to our Father,</hi> &amp;c. Now <hi>the Axe is laid to the Root of the Trees,</hi> Mat. 3.9, 10. [<hi>Now</hi>] as if he ſhould ſay, the caſe is altered; your being the fleſhly Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> would do <hi>then,</hi> or give you a right to Circumciſion; but this will not do <hi>now,</hi> this will give you no right to Goſpel-Baptiſm, the Diſpenſation is changed; actual Faith, and Fruits meet for Repentance, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of all who have a right to Baptiſm.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Moreover, 'tis evident that Chriſt in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in and eſtabliſhing of the ſecond Covenant and Goſpel-Church-State, diſſolved, and for ever took away the old Covenant, and Church-State of the Jews, with all their Rites, initiating Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances and Priviledges whatſoever.</p>
                  <p>Suppoſe a Man ſhould make his Will, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queath ſuch or ſuch Legacies to ſuch and ſuch Perſons; and yet afterwards he abrogates that Will, and makes another, which is his laſt Will and Teſtament, in which he leaves out the Names of thoſe Perſons, and doth not bequeath thoſe Legacies to them; Can they recover thoſe Legacies by virtue of the old abrogated Will? The caſe is the ſame here; If Infants have right to Baptiſm and viſible Church-Memberſhip, it
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:44276:19"/>
muſt be found in Chriſt's Goſpel, which is his laſt Will and Teſtament, or they have no ſuch Right you may be ſure, nor ought to be baptized; <hi>He took away the firſt, that he might eſtabliſh the ſecond,</hi> Heb. 10.2.</p>
                  <p>Your ſecond Anſwer to this Objection, <hi>viz. That Infants are no where commanded to be baptized,</hi> is this, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     <q>Altho they are not, ſay you, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly named, yet are they neceſſarily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in the Commiſſion, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19, 20. Infants being a very conſiderable part of all Nations; ſurely the univerſal (all Nations) does include the Individuals, tho our Saviour does not particularly name them.</q>
To clear this, you make uſe of a Similitude.
<q>Suppoſe, ſay you, the King ſhould grant his Royal Charter to make this your Market-Town a Corporati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and all the Inhabitants of it Free-Men, would any be ſo idle as to ſuppoſe that this Royal Grant doth not include your Children, becauſe it doth not particularly name them? Is not the Son of a Free-man a Free-man as well as his Father? Thus in the Sacred Charter and Royal Patent of the Covenant of Grace, which is ſealed by Baptiſm; all the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges and Promiſes of that Covenant granted to Believers, concern their Children as well as themſelves, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38. <hi>The Promiſe is to you and to your Children</hi>; the Promiſe of the Covenant belongs to you and to yours. The Infants then of Believers are included together with themſelves, tho not particularly named.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. I reply, that you argue not only ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſtically, but alſo very weakly; for are not <hi>Pagans, Turks</hi> and <hi>Infidels,</hi> with the profane and ungodly Men and Women, and their Children,<note place="margin">All Nations takes in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and their Children.</note> a very conſiderable part of all Nations? nay, the far greateſt part of all Nations; for Chriſt's Flock comparatively is but a little Flock: And
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:44276:20"/>
are theſe included in the Commiſſion, tho not named? You muſt ſay they be, or elſe confeſs there is nothing in what you ſay in the leaſt upon this account.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If that Univerſal does include every Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual in all Nations, all theſe are included as well as Infants of Believers. Sir, you muſt be corrected here for your bold and daring Abuſe of the Sacred Commiſſion of our Bleſſed Lord; for I appeal to your Conſcience, or to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of all impartial Men, whether, by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the Commiſſion, any one Perſon ought to be Baptized, but ſuch who is firſt Taught? 'tis not ſaid, Go, Baptize all Nations; mark, but <hi>go ye therefore, teach all Nations,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>; that is, diſciple, make Diſciples in all Nations, baptizing them, that is, ſuch who are ſo taught or made Diſciples. And this is according to Chriſt's own Practice, <hi>Jeſus made and baptized more Diſciples than</hi> John, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> John 4.1. firſt he made them Diſciples, and then Baptized them, and thus runs his Commiſſion. Therefore ſince none are expreſſed, as required in all Nations to be Baptized, but ſuch as are firſt taught and diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled; Infants of Believers, as well as <hi>Pagans,</hi> and Unbelievers and their Children, are exclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. As when God commanded the Male Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to be Circumciſed, he thereby excluded all Female Children: Or when he commanded <hi>Abraham</hi> to Circumciſe on the eighth Day, he virtually forbad him to Circumciſe on the ſeventh or ninth day, as I ſaid before; or as when he commanded the Ark to be carried on the Prieſts Shoulders, he forbad them to carry it on a Cart; and for their preſumption ſo to do, it provoked God, and coſt <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zzah</hi> his Life: So and in like manner, all that are not expreſſed, as injoined or required to be Baptized by the Authority of the Commiſſion, are excluded.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="31" facs="tcp:44276:20"/>3. And as to your Simile, there's nothing in it; for you ſhould firſt prove, that the Nature of the Sacred Charter of the Church about the Royal Grant of that Spiritual Corporation, runs Parallel-wiſe with the King's Charter of making a Civil Corporation: make that appear, and you do your Buſineſs. But, alas, <hi>Sir,</hi> you beg, and inſtead of arguing, take that for granted which is utterly denied. 'Tis not the firſt Birth that brings us into the Covenant of Grace, but the Second; not Generation, but Regeneration; not being born of Believers, but by our being born of God: See <hi>John</hi> 1.12, 13. <hi>To as many as received him, to them gave be Power</hi> (Gr. <hi>Priviledg</hi>) <hi>to become the Sons of God: Which were not born of Blood, nor of the Will of the Fleſh, nor of the Will of Man, but of God. If ye be Chriſt's, then are ye</hi> Abraham <hi>'s Seed, and Heirs according to the Promiſe,</hi> Gal. 3.29. <hi>The Children of the Fleſh, theſe are not the Children of God,</hi> Rom. 9.8. Thus the Royal Charter of the Goſpel, or Spiritual Corporation of the Covenant and Goſpel-Church-State runs; <hi>i. e.</hi> You muſt be a Believer, you muſt be born again, be a new Creature, and ſo muſt your Children, before you or they either can be free-Men and Women of this Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or be <hi>Fellow-Citizens with the Saints and Houſhold of God,</hi> Epheſ. 2.19. And indeed the Covenant of Grace ran thus, as it was made with <hi>Abraham</hi>; though he was in it, yet all his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were not included, though Circumciſed. Was the Royal Grant made ſo, that it included <hi>Iſhmael</hi> and <hi>Eſau?</hi> Were the Promiſes and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of the Covenant of Grace belonging to them? doth not the Apoſtle poſitively deny it, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.7? <hi>Neither becauſe they are the Seed of</hi> Abraham, <hi>are they all Children; but in</hi> Iſaac <hi>ſhall thy Seed be called:</hi> that is, <hi>they which are the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Fleſh, theſe are not the Children of God;
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:44276:21"/>
but the Children of the Promiſe are counted for the Seed,</hi> Ver. 9.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If all the Priviledges and Promiſes granted to Believers, ſo concern all their Children, they muſt all be ſaved, for that is the Promiſe and bleſſed Priviledg of all Believers; <hi>He that hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth my Words, and believeth on him that ſent me, hath everlaſting Life, and ſhall not come into Condemnation,</hi> John 5.24. If this were true Doctrine that you teach the deceived and blind World, the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of Believers Seed were great indeed, and their State happy: but alas 'tis no ſuch thing, they are, as born, and as they come into the World from the Loins of their Parents, in the same woful condition, and alike polluted as the Children of Unbelievers; and many of the beſt of God's People have now-adays, as well as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, wicked Children; and many die in Sin, and periſh eternally, which they could not do, had they the ſame Promiſes and Priviledges their believing Parents have; therefore you teach falſe Doctrine, and ought to be rectified and ſharply corrected.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. If they have the ſame Priviledges their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Parents have, and that by the Royal Grant and Charter of Chriſt given to his Church, Why do you not, as the ancient erroneous Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers did, give them the Euchariſt? I affirm, they have as much right to that Sacrament, (as they have to the Sacrament of Baptiſm, as I ſhall prove in its place) by your Arguing and Argument.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. And laſtly, As to that Text cited by you, to prove what you ſay in <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38. <hi>For the Promiſe is to you and to your Children,</hi> doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to their Children <hi>quatenus</hi> as Children, but to ſuch of their Children, or Off-ſpring, God by his Word and Spirit ſhould call, (as the Sequel of the Verſe clearly ſhews) <hi>for the Promiſe is to
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:44276:21"/>
you, and to your Children, and to all that are afar off, even to ſo many</hi> (mark) <hi>as the Lord our God ſhall call.</hi> To you Jews, and not only to you, but to the Gentiles alſo, which were ſaid to be afar off, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.17. <hi>And came and preached Peace to you that were afar off.</hi> But then 'tis with this Reſtriction or Limitation, even to ſo many of you, and your Children, and them afar off, which the Lord our God ſhall call: and when Children are, by the Grace of God effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually called, we deny not but that you may Baptize them.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>pag.</hi> 7. upon the <hi>Popular Objection,</hi> as you call it, againſt Infant-Baptiſm, from the Silence of the Scripture in that Caſe, you argue thus, <hi>viz.</hi>

                  <p>Though, <hi>Sir,</hi> I muſt tell you, Conſequences that are genuine, or are naturally deduced from the Scripture, to prove and demonſtrate Matter of Faith, (as in the caſe of the Reſurrection, or about the Deity of the Son of God, or any thing of like nature, are one thing) and Conſequences
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:44276:22"/>
brought to prove a Poſitive Law or Inſtitutions, are another thing. Pray, did God by <hi>Moſes</hi> give forth any Law, or poſitive Rite or Precept ſo darkly, that it could not be proved but by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences? for that is the caſe here between you and us. <hi>Moſes</hi> delivered every Law, Statute and Ordinanance ſo plainly to the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that <hi>he that ran might read it.</hi> And ſhall any Man think that our bleſſed Saviour, who declared all things plainly from his Father, and was faithful as a Son over his own Houſe, would leave any poſitive Law or Precept of the Goſpel ſo dark, that there is no way to underſtand it but by Conſequences?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But ſecondly, our main Objection lies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt your pretended Conſequences; for we poſitively deny that any of your Inferences or Conſequences which you bring to prove Infant-Baptiſm, do naturally follow from the Scripture-Texts, to which you refer, or from whence you draw them: and blame us not, ſince your own Brethren (ſuch too as Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Down,</hi> &amp;c.) do affirm, that thoſe Scriptures from whence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you draw your Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences for this Practice, are not naturally drawn therefrom, but are very uncertain and doubtful: if you know not this, it will appear you have read but little of them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. As touching Prayer, that is <hi>a Branch of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Religion,</hi> or a <hi>Moral Duty,</hi> and therefore quite different from this the Controverſy is about; yet that it is poſitively enjoined and commanded in the Goſpel alſo,<note place="margin">1 Theſſ. 5.17, 18.</note> we deny not; <hi>Pray always, pray without ceaſing, and for every thing give Thanks.</hi> What can be more plain? Beſides, we ſin not if we pray thrice a day, or ſeven times a day; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Prayer is unadviſedly and improperly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by you upon this account.</p>

                     <pb n="35" facs="tcp:44276:22"/>4. As touching Womens receiving the Lord's-Supper, that is proved more than by Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences: Let a Man examine himſelf, <hi>i. e. Man</hi> or <hi>Woman,</hi> for ſo the word <gap reason="foreign">

There <hi>is one Mediator between God and Man.</hi> Is not the <hi>Woman</hi> comprehended as clearly as the <hi>Man?</hi> Are not Male and Female all one in Chriſt Jeſus? <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.28. And, as we have lately told your caviling Brethren the <hi>Athenian Society,</hi> did you never read of the Figure <hi>Sylepſis</hi> or <hi>Conceptio,</hi> that compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends the leſs worthy under the more worthy, <hi>indignioris ſub digniore?</hi> As for Example, <hi>Quid tu &amp; ſoror facitis; ego &amp; mater miſeri perimus; tu &amp; uxor qui adfuiſtis teſtes eſtete</hi>; and is no leſs true in Divinity: See that full Text, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.16. <gap reason="foreign">

Mary</hi> the Mother of Jeſus, and the other good Women who were Chriſt's Diſciples, were of the number of the hundred and twenty Diſciples who brake Bread with the three thouſand that were added to them, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 'Tis ſaid <hi>Acts</hi> 8.12. <hi>They were baptized both Men and Women.</hi> Now ſuch a Conſequence as this we deny not, <hi>viz.</hi> Women were Diſciples, Women were baptized, and therefore broke Bread: for all who were true Diſciples of Chriſt and baptized, had an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Right to the Lord's-Supper. Bring us ſuch Grounds and Conſequences for your Infant-Baptiſm and Church-Memberſhip, and we will contend with you no more. But to ſatisfy the Reader more fully as to this, I deſire him to ſee Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> Anſwer to Mr. <hi>Blindman.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. As to the <hi>firſt day</hi> of the Week, being the day appointed for Chriſtians to obſerve under the Goſpel in the Worſhip and Service of God, we have Proof enough without Conſequences. Sir, we always affirm an Apoſtolical Practice, or a Goſpel-Precedent, is of like nature and of
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:44276:23"/>
equal Authority with a Goſpel Precept. Do we not read, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.1, 2. that <hi>when the day of Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecoſt was fully come, the Diſciples were all gathered together with one accord in one place</hi>; which was the firſt Day of the Week? And was not this their aſſembling on that day, as the day of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Sabbath, ratified and confirmed from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, by that wonderful Effuſion of the Holy Ghoſt, or extraordinary Gifts of the Spirit? And is it not ſaid, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.7. the Church came together on the firſt Day of the Week to break Bread? And doth not the Apoſtle exhort the Church at <hi>Corinth,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.1, 2. upon the firſt Day of the Week to make Collections, or to gather and lay in ſtore for the Poor, as he had given Orders to the Churches of <hi>Galatia?</hi> this they could not do, if they met not on that Day. And what tho we cannot prove without Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, that he who was the Lord of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath did change the Day, <hi>&amp;c</hi> ſeeing we have ſuch plain and expreſs Examples or Precedents for the Obſervation of the firſt Day of Week, and none but that in the times of the Goſpel? Therefore now we ſay,</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Could you give us but one Example, one Precedent in all the New Teſtament, that any one Infant was baptized, we would give up the Cauſe: but as you can give us none, ſo you cannot give us any Conſequences, that without the abuſe of the Scripture naturally flow from the Texts to which you refer; therefore all this ſtir in mentioning theſe particular Caſes, are remote to your Buſineſs, and prove nothing, they being not like parallel Caſes to yours.</p>
                  <p>But to come to your Argument for Infant-Baptiſm, which you would have to run parallel with that, for Womens receiving the Lord's-Supper: I will repeat them both, and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to the laſt.</p>

                     <q>All Chriſt's Diſciples ought to partake of his Supper: Women are Diſciples, therefore to partake of his Supper.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>You proceed;
<q>All Chriſt's Diſciples ought to be baptized; but ſome Children are his Diſciples, therefore to be baptized.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. I deny your <hi>Minor</hi>; you ſay ſome Children are Diſciples, the Scripture you bring to prove it, is <hi>Acts</hi> 15.1, 8, 10. <hi>Anſw.</hi> That Scripture proves no ſuch thing: the Yoke that was laid on the Neck of thoſe Diſciples were Men, or Adult Perſons, or Gentile Saints; they were ſuch Diſciples thoſe falſe Brethten would have laid the Yoke of Circumciſion upon.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A Diſciple is one taught or inſtructed, as the genuine and proper Signification of that word holds forth; but Infants have no Underſtanding,<note place="margin">

                  <p>Your ſecond Proof, is their Parents Dedication of them to Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer; Parents have no Warrant from God's Word to dedicate their Children to Chriſt by Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, nor doth that Dedication infuſe any Divine Habits into them, or the leaſt Light, Knowledg, or Underſtanding; therefore that Dedication cannot render them to be Diſciples.</p>
                  <p>Your third Proof is Chriſt's gracious Accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them at their hands.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, Chriſt only laid his Hands upon ſome Children who were brought to him, and bleſſed them; but this doth not prove they are Diſciples, or that he baptized any Infant.

                     <hi>Wherein the grand Argument for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-Baptiſm taken from the Covenant made with</hi> Abraham, <hi>is fully confuted.

                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>I Come now to examine your ſecond grand Argument for the Baptiſm of Infants, which you in <hi>Pag.</hi> 8. laid down thus, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Arg. 2.</note>If the Infants of believing Chriſtians under the Goſpel are in Covenant with God, as the Jewiſh Infants under the Law were; then the Seal of the Covenant, which is Baptiſm, may and ought to be adminiſtred to them.</p>
               <p>But the Infants of Believers under the Goſpel are in Covenant with God,<note place="margin">He ſhould have menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion in his Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> as well as the Jewiſh Infants under the Law were.</p>
               <p>Therefore Baptiſm, the Seal of the Covenant, ought to be applied to theſe, as Circumciſion was to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Tho this Syllogiſm is not perfect in Form, yet I will paſs by that Overſight of yours, and conſider it in each part, and finding it ſophiſtical, muſt deny the whole Argument.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:44276:24"/>1. For firſt, as to your <hi>Major,</hi> If the Infants of Chriſtians were in Covenant with God, as the Jewiſh Infants were, yet Baptiſm cannot belong to them, unleſs God hath commanded them to be baptized, and made it alſo a Seal of the ſame Covenant: for as much as Baptiſm, (as I have told you before once or twice already) is a meer poſitive Law or Inſtitution, 'tis not Man, but God himſelf muſt make it their Duty to be baptized, and a Seal of the Covenant, if it were ſo indeed: but God hath neither en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned them, or made it their Duty to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, nor appointed it to be a Seal of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace to them; <hi>Ergo.</hi> Alſo you miſtake, in calling Circumciſion a Seal of the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham</hi>; for 'tis only called the <hi>Seal of the Righteouſneſs of the Faith he had,</hi> (that is <hi>Abraham</hi>) <hi>and which he had, being yet uncircumciſed.</hi> 'Tis not called a Seal of the Covenant, but of Faith, and that too of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Faith only, becauſe none before they were circumciſed had ſuch a Faith but himſelf only. Nor can you prove Chriſt's true Baptiſm is a Seal of the Covenant of Grace under the Goſpel, the holy Spirit is the only Seal of the Covenant of Grace mentioned in the Scripture, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.13, 14. <hi>chap.</hi> 4.30.</p>
               <p>If therefore I ſhould grant, that the Infants of Believers under the Goſpel, as ſuch, were in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God, which I muſt deny, yet it would not follow in the leaſt that they ought to be baptized, from that ground: for, were not, think you, all the Children of the Godly before <hi>Abraham</hi>'s time, or before he received that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Command to circumciſe them in your ſenſe, in Covenant with God? If you do not ſay this, why do you affirm, that the Children of Believers were always, or ever in Covenant as well as their Parents? but if it were ſo, Do you
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:44276:25"/>
think it was their Duty to circumciſe them? If you ſhould ſay, no, becauſe they did not know to circumciſe them was the Will of God. But you might ſay more, <hi>viz.</hi> it was not the Will of God they ſhould do it; 'tis God's Command only, and not their being in Covenant, made it their Duty to circumciſe their Children: and had God given us ſuch a Command, or any Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to baptize our Children, we ought and would baptize them; but muſt not, dare not, without ſuch poſitive Command or Authority.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We utterly alſo deny your <hi>Minor,</hi> and ſay that the Infants of Believers (as ſuch) under the Goſpel, are not in Covenant with God.</p>
               <p>We will therefore examine your Grounds to prove that which you affirm upon this account, <hi>Pag.</hi> 8, 9. and thus you argue, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>They who by Circumciſion were once ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken into Covenant with God, and never ſince were ſolemnly caſt out, do undoubtedly continue in a Covenant-State.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>But Infants under the Law were ſolemnly by God's Appointment taken into Covenant with himſelf, and were never ſince by any Command of God caſt out; therefore they do ſtill conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in Covenant.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. I anſwer firſt of all, that your Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not true in form; Is <hi>Circumciſion</hi> in your <hi>Minor?</hi> Sir, if you are a <hi>Logician,</hi> ſpeak like one;<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kit</hi>'s Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſm not true in form.</note> your <hi>Minor</hi> ſhould run thus, <hi>viz. But Infants were once by Circumciſion, ſolemnly by God's Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, taken into Covenant,</hi> &amp;c. But I'll paſs by that, and muſt tell you your Argument in another re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect is lame alſo; You do not tell us what Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant 'tis you here intend; ought you not to have added, They who were once ſolemnly taken into the Covenant of Grace by Circumciſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but Infants were once ſolemnly taken into the Covenant of Grace by Circumciſion? If you do
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:44276:25"/>
not affirm that, you ſay nothing that concerns our Controverſy. If the Covenant of Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was not the Covenant of Grace, you will and muſt give up your Cauſe: and if you ſay that, you ought to have put it into your Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſm. 3. There is yet another fault in your Argument. If you would include the Controverſy, ought you not to have ſaid, All they who? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Can your Concluſion be good, when your Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions are bad and defective?</p>
               <p>But to the buſineſs; If you ſay Infants, as ſuch, were ſolemnly taken into the Convenant of Grace by Circumciſion; then I deny your <hi>Minor:</hi> Infants, as ſuch, were never by Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, nor any other ways under the Law, taken into the Covenant of Grace. Moreover, I affirm, that tho they were once ſolemnly taken into Covenant with God by Circumciſion, yet that Covenant, and that Covenant Seed, <hi>viz.</hi> the natural Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> are both ſolemnly caſt out; and this I ſhall, God aſſiſting, prove, and afterwards take off all thoſe pretended Abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities you in the 9<hi>th</hi> and 10<hi>th</hi> Pages of your Book mention, and give a full Anſwer to your Reaſons and Arguments you bring to prove the Covenant of Circumciſion was a Covenant of Grace.</p>
               <p n="1">1. And now to proceed, to raze and quite overthrow this main Foundation and Pillar of Pedo-baptiſm; I ſhall argue as Mr. <hi>Tombs</hi> hath done, whoſe Arguments could never be yet anſwered.</p>
               <p>We are firſt of all to conſider, whether the Goſpel-Covenant, and the Covenant of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion made with <hi>Abraham</hi> be the ſame. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Inquire what Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> it is, of which 'tis ſaid, <hi>I will be a God to thee, and to thy Seed,</hi> Gen. 17.7. Thirdly, Whether there be the ſame Reaſon of Circumciſion and of Baptiſm in
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:44276:26"/>
ſignifying the Goſpel-Covenant. Fourthly, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there is the ſame Parity of Reaſon for the one, as for the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant God made with <hi>Abraham</hi> proved to be a mix'd Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, partly Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and partly Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal.</note> The Covenant made with <hi>Abraham</hi> we affirm is not a pure Goſpel-Covenant, but a mix'd Covenant, partly made with his Natural or Fleſhly Seed, and partly made with him and his Spiritual Seed; and therefore we thus argue.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the Covenant takes its Denomination from the Promiſes, and the Promiſes are mix'd, ſome Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical, belonging to thoſe to whom the Goſpel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth; ſome Domeſtick, or Civil Promiſes, ſpecially and abſolutely reſpecting the Houſe and Natural Seed of</hi> Abraham, <hi>and Policy of</hi> Iſrael.

               </p>

               </p>
               <p>From whence I argue:</p>
               <p>All they that are in that Goſpel-Covenant which God made with <hi>Abraham,</hi>

               </p>

               </p>
               <p>As to the <hi>Major,</hi> ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11, 12.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> cannot be denied; no Man in his right Wits will affirm, the Infants of Believers, as ſuch, have the Faith <hi>Abraham</hi> had before he was yet Circumciſed, nor do many of them; nor can they walk in the Steps of <hi>Abraham,</hi> having not his Faith.</p>
               <p>If any object and ſay, <hi>If Infants of Believers are not included in that Covenant made with</hi> Abraham, <hi>How can any of them, who died in Infancy, be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer; 1. Cannot God ſave dying Infants, unleſs they were included in that Covenant made with <hi>Abraham?</hi> How then could the dying Infants of the Godly, who lived before that Covenant was made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> be ſaved?</p>
               <p>God has a thouſand Ways, through Chriſt's Undertakings, to ſave dying Infants, as Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi> notes, which we know not of: Secret things belong to God, and revealed things to us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Were they in any ſenſe included in that Covenant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> though not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:44276:28"/>
counted for his Natural or Spiritual Seed, yet it would not follow from thence that they ought to be Baptized, becauſe the Females, who were truly <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Natural Seed, and ſome of them might be his Spiritual Seed too, yet were not Circumciſed, no more than the Male Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Godly were before <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Time. And,</p>
               <p n="3">3. Were they in Covenant, as they are the Natural-Seed of Believers? then Baptiſm how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever does not bring them into the Covenant: and if ſo, their State is good, whether Baptized or no. And if Baptiſm brings them into the Covenant of Grace, then they have not right thereto, becauſe they are in the Covenant: And if Baptiſm brings them into the Covenant of Grace, and makes the Covenant ſure to them, then it would follow, that 'tis in the Power of Men, either to bring their Children into the Covenant of Grace, or keep them out; and that it is in effect to ſay, Parents have Power to ſave or deſtroy their Children: and how abſurd that is, I will leave to all impartial Men to judg.</p>
               <p>I ſhall, in the next place, prove,<note place="margin">Covenant of Circumciſion no Covenant of Grace.</note> that the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Circumciſion was not a Covenant of Grace, or Faith, and therefore doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the Infant-Seed of believing Gentiles.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I argue thus:<note place="margin">Arg. 1.</note> That Covenant that was made to ſeparate the Natural Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> from all other Nations of the World, and made ſure unto them the Earthly Promiſe of the Poſſeſſion of the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> could not be a Covenant of Grace, which concerns the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-Seed of Believers under the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>But the Covenant of Circumciſion was made to ſeparate the Natural Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> from all other Nations of the World, and made ſure
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:44276:29"/>
unto them the Earthly Promiſe of the Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Land of <hi>Canaan. Ergo,</hi> The Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Circumciſion could not be a Covenant of Grace, which concerns the Infants of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers under the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Major</hi> cannot be denied, becauſe the Goſpel, or ſecond Covenant, is eſtabliſhed upon no ſuch earthly Promiſes as the Covenant of Circumciſion was, not that we ſhould have an Earthly Kingdom, or poſſeſs the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> but it is <hi>eſtabliſhed on better Promiſes</hi> than theſe, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.6.</p>
               <p>Also if that Covenant concerned us, or our Children, who are Gentiles, then the Gentiles had equal Right to that Earthly Inheritance; and then were not the Natural Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> ſeparated from all other People upon the account of that Earthly Bleſſing as their Poſſeſſion only.</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>Minor,</hi> ſee <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. <hi>I will eſtabliſh my Covenant between me and thee,</hi> v.7. <hi>And I will give unto thee, and to thy Seed after thee, the Land wherein thou art a Stranger, all the Land of</hi> Canaan, <hi>for an everlaſting Poſſeſſion; and I will be their God,</hi> v. 8.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This is my Covenant which ye ſhall keep between me and you, and thy Seed after thee; Every Man-Child among you ſhall be cirumciſed,</hi> v. 10.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There were ſome who were circumciſed, to whom the Promiſe of the Goſpel-Covenant God made with <hi>Abraham</hi> did not belong, as <hi>Iſhmael, Eſau,</hi> &amp;c. God expreſly ſaid that his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, (<hi>i. e.</hi> the Covenant of Grace) was not eſtabliſhed with <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> but with <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and yet the Covenant of Circumciſion belonged to <hi>Iſhmael</hi> as well as to <hi>Iſaac.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>See <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.20, 21. <hi>As for</hi> Iſhmael, <hi>I have heard thee, behold, I have bleſſed him,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But my Covenant will I eſtabliſh with</hi> Iſaac, <hi>whom</hi> Sarah <hi>ſhall bear unto thee.</hi> Compare this with
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:44276:29"/>
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.7, 8, 9. <hi>Not becauſe they are the Seed of</hi> Abraham, <hi>are they all Children</hi>; that is, Children of the Covenant of Grace, or the Children of God; <hi>but the Children of the Promiſe are counted for thy Seed</hi>; see <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.29, 30. Nay, all that were in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Houſe, whether born there or Strangers, or ſuch who were bought with his Money, were circumciſed; but will you ſay, all theſe were in that Goſpel-Covenant God made with him?</p>
               <p>Moreover, there were other Perſons in <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s Houſe, who, no doubt, might ſome of them be in the Covenant of Grace, and had the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes belonging to them, who were neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs not circumciſed, namely, the Females; alſo Male Infants dying before the eighth day coming from <hi>Abraham.</hi> Moreover, other godly Men who were not of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Family, yet lived in his time, as <hi>Melchiſedec, Lot, Job,</hi> &amp;c. none of theſe had right to be circumciſed. But if any object and ſay, the Females were circumciſed in the Males; I anſwer with Mr. <hi>Tombs,</hi> it is without Proof; and by like perhaps greater Reaſon it may be ſaid, that the Children of Believers are baptized in the Perſons of their Parents, and therefore are not to be baptized in their own Perſons.</p>
               <p>Also 'tis apparent that the Jews comprehended in that Covenant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Being the Children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> as ſuch, gave them no right to Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion</note> and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed accordingly, were nevertheleſs not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to Baptiſm upon that foot of account; which had the Covenant of Circumciſion been a Goſpel-Covenant, <hi>i. e.</hi> of the ſame nature, I ſee no reaſon why <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt ſhould deny their Argument, <hi>i. e.</hi> We are <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Hence it plainly appears, that the right Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Promiſes were not the adequate Reaſon of Circumciſion: But as I have before ſaid, the Precept, or expreſs Command of God to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</hi>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:44276:30"/>
And from hence I ſhall infer this third Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Arg. <hi>3.</hi> Covenant of Circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to the ungodly as well as the godly.</note>That Covenant that was made with, or did belong unto the fleſhly Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly ones as well as the godly, was not a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, or Goſpel-Covenant.

               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> The Covenant of Circumciſion was not a Covenant of Grace, or Goſpel-Covenant.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Arg. <hi>4.</hi>
                  </note>If all who are in the Covenant of Grace, or Goſpel-Covenant, do know the Lord from the greateſt to the leaſt of them;<note place="margin">All in the new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant need not be taught to know the Lord.</note> then the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Circumciſion could not be the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, or Goſpel-Covenant. But all who are in the Covenant of Grace, or Goſpel-Covenant, do know the Lord from the greateſt to the leaſt of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> The Covenant of Circumciſion was not the Covenant of Grace.</p>
               <p>This Argument is fully proved by that in <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.32, 33, 34. Speaking of the new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant which God would make with the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which ſhould not be according to the old, he goes on and tells us what God would do in that Covenant-day; <hi>that he would put his Law into their inward parts, and write it in their Hearts. And they ſhall teach no more every Man his Neighbour, and every Man his Brother, ſaying, Know the Lord; for they ſhall all know-me, from the leaſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of them unto the greateſt of them, ſaith the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And indeed in this very reſpect the Goſpel-Covenant is not according to the old, as the Lord ſaid it ſhould not be, as well as in divers other caſes; for many of thoſe who were in the old Covenant (to which Circumciſion did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain) were Infants, tho all of them were
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:44276:30"/>
not taken in by Circumciſion: for Female In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants were received into that old Covenant without it. Now theſe Children who were taken into that Covenant, did not know the Lord. Infants having no Underſtanding, know not their right Hand from their left, it is therefore im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible they ſhould know the Lord;<note place="margin">A neceſſity that Infants be taught to know the Lord.</note> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore alſo there was a neceſſity after they were in that Covenant, that they ſhould be taught to know the Lord: Firſt, that God is, and what a God he is, and ſo to know him, as to fear him and ſerve him in Sincerity.</p>
               <p>But in the Goſpel-Covenant God promiſed it ſhould be otherwiſe; all who were received into that Covenant, ſhould be Adult Perſons, or ſuch who did know the Lord, which plainly implies no ignorant Infant ſhould be taken into that Covenant, and be a Member of that Church-State; for if ſo, then it would follow, ſuch would have the like need to be taught to know the Lord, as they had in the old Covenant Church-State. And remakable it is, that this Text doth clearly intimate, that all who ſhould be taken into the Goſpel-Covenant, or Goſpel-Church, ſhould be diſcipled or taught, firſt to know God: for to be taught or diſcipled, is all one and the ſame thing, which agrees with Chriſt's great Commiſſion, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19, 20. where he gave Directions who, or what kind of Perſons they were to be, that he would have his Apoſtles receive into his Goſpel-Church: and that they ſhould be all of them firſt taught or made Diſciples, and as ſuch be baptized, is clearly declared. Now that this Text in <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. refers to the Goſpel-Covenant, is evident; ſee <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.7, 8, 9, 10.</p>
               <p>That Covenant that was a part or branch of the old Covenant, or Covenant of Works,<note place="margin">

               <p>It accepted (as he ſhews) of no ſhort En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, nor gave any Strength, and is called a Miniſtration of Death and of Condemnation, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. And moreover, 'tis called in expreſs terms, the old Covenant which God made with the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> when he brought them up out of the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> Heb. 8.9. Alſo the new Covenant is ſaid to be directly contrary unto it, or not according to it, but oppoſed thereto, and that there was no Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs by it, nor Life: for, as the Apoſtle ſhews, if there had, Chriſt is dead in vain; and beſides, the Apoſtle ſays 'tis done away.

                  <q>Now, ſaith he, that the Covenant of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion is of the ſame ſtamp, is evident; for tho God promiſed to be a God to <hi>Abraham</hi> and to his Seed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7, 8. as he did alſo in the <hi>Sinai</hi>-Covenant to the ſame People in the Wilderneſs; yet ſtill it was upon condition of Obedience, with an anſwerable threatning in caſe of Diſobedince, <hi>ver.</hi> 9, 10. <hi>Thou ſhalt keep my Covenant therefore, thou, and thy Seed after thee in their Generations.

               <p>And as the Terms were the ſame, ſo were the Promiſes; that which was the great Promiſe of the Covenant of Circumciſion, was the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and God to be their God, in fulfilling that earthly Promiſe to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Natural Seed, upon the Condition of the keeping that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant on their parts.</p>
               <p>That which Mr. <hi>Flavel</hi> hath ſaid in his laſt Reply,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Flavel</hi> anſwered, in what he ſays in his Book, <hi>p. 217.</hi>

               <p>To which I anſwer, by way of Conceſſion, yet muſt ſay, that Covenant had ſeveral Miniſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Additions, as had alſo the Covenant of Grace; becauſe the Covenant of Works was made with <hi>Adam,</hi> by which he ſtood in the time of his Innocency, juſtified and accepted by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue thereof.</p>
               <p>Could not God give forth a ſecond Miniſtration or Tranſcript of his Righteous and Holy Law; though not to Juſtification, yet to aggravate his Sin, and ſo to his juſt Condemnation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And doth not St. <hi>Paul</hi> aſſert the ſame thing, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.19, 20. compared with <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.13. <hi>That Sin by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment</hi> (or Law) <hi>might become exceeding ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful?</hi> So <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.19.</p>
               <p>Nay, I will affirm always generally, when the Scriptures of the New-Teſtament ſpeak of the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:44276:32"/>
Old Covenant, or firſt Covenant,<note place="margin">The <hi>Sinai</hi> Covenant, called the Old or firſt Covenant in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> or Covenant of Works, it paſſes by in ſilence the Covenant made with <hi>Adam</hi>; and more immediately and directly applies it to the <hi>Sinai</hi>-Covenant, and to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Cirrumciſion, as all careful Readers, who read the Epiſtles to the <hi>Romans, Galathians,</hi> and to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> may clearly find. But to proceed, Though we ſay there is but one Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, yet it is evident there were ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral diſtinct Miniſtrations or Additions of it; yet we ſay, the Promiſe of the Goſpel, or Goſpel-Covenant, was the ſame in all Ages, in reſpect of things promiſed, with the Nature and Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity thereof, which is a free and abſolute Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, without Works, or any Conditions or fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen Acts of Righteouſneſs, or any thing to be done by the Creature, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 5.</p>
               <p>The Subſtance and eſſential Part of this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, is Chriſt, Faith, a new Heart,<note place="margin">See Mr. <hi>Tombs.</hi> The New Covenant had divers Additions or Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripts, or divers Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrations.</note> Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Remiſſion of Sins, Sanctification, Perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and everlaſting Life. Yet this Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Covenant had divers Forms or Tranſcripts of it, which ſignified thoſe things, and various Sanctions by which it was given forth and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. To <hi>Adam</hi> the Promiſe was made, under the name of <hi>the Seed of the Woman bruiſing the Head of the Serpent</hi>; to <hi>Enoch, Noah,</hi> &amp;c. In other Forms to <hi>Abraham,</hi> under the name of <hi>his Seed, in whom all the Nations of the Earth ſhould be bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</hi> To <hi>Moſes,</hi> by the name of <hi>a great Prophet of his Brethren like unto him</hi>; and it was alſo ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him under dark Shadows and Sacrifices.

               <p>But now, becauſe there were ſo many Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Goſpel Promiſe and New-Covenant; are there ſo many New Covenants? this being ſo,

               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But leſt any ſhould think, that we ſhut out all dying Infants from having any Benefit by Chriſt.</p>

               <p>But let me here add one word or two further, <hi>i. e.</hi> Circumciſion, you ſay, was a Priviledg; ſo we ſay too; but not ſuch a Priviledg as you do imagine.</p>

               <p>I come now to what you further aſſert in the 9<hi>th</hi> Page of your Book, <hi>viz.</hi>

                  <q>That Infants were in Covenant under the Law, and by ſpecial appointment of God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7. but are not now caſt out by Chriſt under the Goſpel.</q>
This differs but little from the old Argument of Mr. <hi>Baxter, Sidenham,</hi> &amp;c. the latter ſpeaks thus, <hi>Infants of Believers were never caſt out of the viſible Church of which they were once.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Infants being once Members of the Jewiſh Church,<note place="margin">Infants the Members once of the Jewiſh-Church, yet not of the Goſpel-Church.</note> doth not prove they were ever Members of the Goſpel-Church: the Male In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants of God's Prieſts under the old Covenant, when grown up, had other Priviledges: If we muſt call Circumciſion a Priviledg, which the Sons of Chriſt's Miniſters have no right to under the Goſpel, and yet no where in expreſs words in the New-Teſtament excluded from that Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledg.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But I have proved the Covenant for Infants, in Covenanting under the Law, was no Goſpel Covenant, and ſo concerns not our Infants.</p>
               <p n="3">3. According to that Maxim, <hi>Ownis privatio intimat habitum</hi>; you know that every Diſpoſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on implieth a Poſſeſſion. Infants therefore cannot be caſt out of the Goſpel-Church, before it can be proved they were ever admitted. If Mr. <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kitt,</hi> or the <hi>Athenian Society,</hi> or any Men living, can tell us in what viſible Adminiſtration Children were admitted viſible Church-Members before <hi>Abraham</hi>'s days, which was above 2000 Years; and you ſay ſomewhat, you affirm they were always in Covenant.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Sidenham</hi> makes mention of a two-fold be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Covenant; 1. In relation to Election.
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:44276:35"/>

               </p>
               <p>To this I anſwer; The Covenant of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion belonged to the Children of the Fleſh, to <hi>Iſhmael</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> as well as <hi>Jacob,</hi> who were not in the Election of Grace: therefore thoſe who were Circumciſed, were not ſo in Covenant. Children of Unbelievers may be in that ſenſe in Covenant, as well as the Children of Believers; as many of them afterwards prove to be, nay, may be more of them than of the Children of Believers.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As touching Infants being in Covenant, <hi>In facie viſibilis Eccleſiae,</hi> in the face of a viſible Church. I anſwer, Though they were ſo in the Jewiſh Church under the Old Covenant, ſome with Circumciſion were brought in, and ſome without it; yet that Covenant, and Covenant-Seed are (as I have and ſhall yet prove) caſt out, which will be a final Anſwer.</p>
               <p>Thus I argue;</p>

               <p>Object. <hi>But may be you will object, and ſay, that you do not contend for that particular Rite or Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, but of a viſible Church-Memberſhip of Infants perpetual in all Ages, and an indefinite Seal.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>Reply</hi>; How doth it appear the Infants of the Godly before <hi>Abraham</hi>'s time, had any right to viſible Church-Memberſhip? or what Seal had they?</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> You ſhould, before you brought this pretended Abſurdity upon us, have ſhewed what Advantage did accrue to Infants by Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, and how that added to the goodneſs of their Condition; it put them, 'tis plain, to a great deal of Pain; and the Apoſtle ſays, it was a Yoke of Bondage, which neither they nor their Fathers could bear.</p>
               <p>Being Members of that Church, did not ſave them, nor purge away Original Sin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> tho I doubt not it ſerved for the end God appointed it; yet I ſay, how did it add to the goodneſs of Infants Condition?</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Then,</hi> ſay you, <hi>the Privileges of the Goſpel are ſtraiter and narrower than thoſe of the Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> If you once imagine, that the outward or external Privileges of the Goſpel are larger,<note place="margin">External Privileges under the Law great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than ours under the Goſpel.</note> or ſo large as thoſe were under the Law, you are greatly miſtaken. The Jews and Jewiſh Teachers or Prieſts had many external Privileges which Chriſtians and Miniſters under the Goſpel have not; they had a lovely Country promiſed to them, a <hi>Land that flowed with Milk and Hony:</hi> out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Peace, Riches, and gathering of Wealth, were Privileges belonging to them; but we under the Goſpel have no ſuch Privileges, but are to expect Perſecution, and what not.</p>
               <p>Yet our Privileges are better and greater, tho more ſpiritual, 'tis a Covenant <hi>eſtabliſhed upon better Promiſes</hi>: our Children, when grown up, ſit under the clear and glorious Light of the Goſpel which they and theirs then had held forth but in dark Shadows.</p>
               <p>Moreover, Then the Church-State was confin'd to the natural Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> &amp;c. But now all in all Nations who repent and believe the Goſpel, the poor Gentiles are now become Fellow-Heirs indeed: our ſpiritual Priviledges do infinitely excel theirs, but not in Externals,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:44276:38"/>
now greater Infuſions of the holy Spirit.</p>
               <p>O Sir, what Priviledges had the Gentiles or their Children then? is not the caſe mended with us?</p>
               <p n="3">3. You ſay,
<q>If it were the Will of God Infants under the Goſpel ſhould be reckoned as out of his Covenant, who were in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, then it follows, ſay you, that our Saviour was unfaithful, or forgetful to his Church, in that he never acquainted her with this Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but not one word by way of Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion do we find in all the New Teſtament, from whence we may conclude, that Chriſt's not repealing the Practice of initiating Infants, nor forbidding their Admiſſion into the Church by Baptiſm, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. I anſwer, had it been the Will of God, that Infants ſhould under the Goſpel be admitted into the Church by Baptiſm, Chriſt you might rather ſay, had been forgetful or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful in not giving the leaſt intimation of his Mind and Pleaſure therein, who declared all things plainly from the Father, and was faithful as a Son over his own Houſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That which is not contained in his laſt Will and Teſtament in this and other matters, is ſufficient to declare his Mind and Will in the Negative. And ſo you know 'tis in all laſt Wills and Teſtaments among Men, if it be not expreſſed in the Affirmative, it needs not be expreſſed in the Negative; and if not becauſe 'tis not forbidden it may be done, ſo may a hundred things more; nay, many Jewiſh Rites and Popiſh Innovations too, for where are they forbid? The ſum therefore of our Anſwer to all you ſay upon this account, is this; The Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges which are Rites, Ordinances or Sacraments, are not ſo many as you would have, or ſo many as the Jews of old had, nor are they to be
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:44276:38"/>
adminiſtred according as you fancy or approve of, or according to your Reaſonings, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to God's expreſs Appointment. Rightly doth Mr. <hi>Ball</hi> in his forementioned Book ſpeak, <hi>Poſit.</hi> 3, 4. <hi>p.</hi> 38.

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Did this ſtumble them in the Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Days, who were told, that <hi>Circumciſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed nothing, nor <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircumciſion?</hi> the truth is, if Circumciſion availed nothing, but was a Yoke of Bondage, then why ſhould that ſtumble them?

It might be a greater Stumbling-block in their way, to tell them their Church-State, and all their Privileges are now gone, and now they muſt not look upon themſelves better than the Gentiles; no more <hi>Scepter</hi> in <hi>Judah,</hi> no Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> no <hi>Temple,</hi> no <hi>High-Prieſt, the Levites Sons, as ſuch,</hi> now no more Miniſters, no Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of Prieſt-hood: What of all this, when they hear of better Privileges for them?

                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>YOur third Argument, to prove Infants ought to be baptized, is this,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Burkits</hi> third Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to prove Infant Baptiſm.</note> 
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>If Infants are capable of Spiritual Benefit by Baptiſm, then Baptiſm may and ought to be adminiſtred to Infants; if they are capable of the inward viſible Grace, ſure they may par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the outward and viſible Sign; if the Word of the Promiſe doth belong to them, ſurely the Seal of the Promiſe ought not to be withheld from them.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>But, ſay you, the former is true, <hi>viz.</hi> That Infants are capable of Benefits by Baptiſm; therefore the latter is true, they ought to be Baptized. There are, amongſt others, two ſpecial Bleſſings, and ſpiritual Benefits which Infants are capable of by Baptiſm, namely, Remiſſion of Sin, and Regeneration.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:44276:43"/>1.
<q>Remiſſion of Sin; this being an Act of gracious Favour in God, diſcharging a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon from his obnoxiouſneſs to Wrath upon the ſcore of Guilt contracted, an Infant is certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as capable of this Act of Favour, as a grown Perſon. To prove this, you bring in a Simile, That an Infant of a Traitor is as capable of the benefit of the King's gracious Favour, as the Father himſelf. Suppoſe the King ſhould ſend for a Traitor's Child out of the Cradle, (ſay you) and before all his Courtiers declare, That whereas the Blood of that Child was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted by its Father's Treaſon, and therefore, according to Law, its whole Inheritance became forfeited to the Crown; yet, ſays the King, I will pardon this Infant freely, and reſtore him to all his forfeited Rights; and in token thereof, I command one of my Miniſters to waſh the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant in pure Water, ſignifying thereby to all my Subjects, that he is cleanſed from his ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Attainder and Corruption of Blood, and that I am perfectly reconciled to him.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>I demand, (ſay you now) whether any one can truly ſay, that this Action was inſignificant to the Child, becauſe he did not underſtand it? <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Were not the Male Infants of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers before <hi>Abraham</hi>'s days, as capable of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges and Benefits of Circumciſion, as <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s Male Infants were? If ſo, why were not they Circumciſed? If you ſay it was, Becauſe God did not require them to be Circumciſed, they were not commanded to do it: Even ſo ſay I, God hath not commanded Believers to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize their Infants; therefore whatſoever Benefit or Bleſſing they are capable of, it ſignifies no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the Caſe, unleſs there was a Command or Law given us to baptize them.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:44276:43"/>2. Might you not as well argue, that Infants are capable of the Benefits or Spiritual Bleſſings ſignified by the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, therefore may partake of that alſo? Are not they capable of Redemption from Sin and Wrath, by the breaking of Chriſt's Body, and ſhedding of his Blood?</p>
               <p n="3">3. And are not Infants of Unbelievers, nay, <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Pagans,</hi> capable of the Spiritual Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits ſignified in Baptiſm? ſure, as conſidered in themſelves, they are: and why then may they not be baptized alſo?</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Sir,</hi> 'Tis not ſuch are capable of receiving a Favour or Priviledg from God, but rather who he hath in his Sovereign Wiſdom granted that Privilege unto: And let me tell you, your Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mile quite overthrows your own Argument; for if God, becauſe he is graciouſly pleaſed to acquit our Children who die in their Infancy, from the Original Guilt they brought into the World with them, through the Atonement made by Jeſus Chriſt, and in token thereof had commanded us to baptize them, the Caſe was clear, and our Controverſy was at an end: but ſince he has not required us to do any ſuch thing, whatever Grace or Favour he is pleaſed to afford to any of our Infants, we have no Warrant to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize them; his Will and Law, and not our Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, being that which gives us Authority to do all we do in his Name or Worſhip. If God had commanded us to baptize our Infants, we would no more ſay that Action would be inſignificant to our Children, no more than Circumciſion was to Children under the Law, whom God required to be Circumciſed.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Beſides, in the laſt place, Baptiſm doth not, by God's appointment, belong to them who are capable of the Benefits or Bleſſings ſignified thereby, as Remiſſion of Sin and Regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

                  <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but only to ſuch who are capable to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and profeſs Faith in Chriſt; theſe we ſay, and none elſe, ought to be baptized, if the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Charter, or Grant of the Lord Jeſus, be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the caſe of a regal Right to Baptiſm, Suppoſe the King ſhould grant to you, and to all in your Pariſh, (who have been Traitors to him) who are skilled or learned in the Mathematicks, and underſtand the Law, to be Officers in ſome of his Courts, and will then alſo upon ſubmiſſion pardon you and them of all your horrid Crimes: will you upon this, carry up ſeveral ignorant un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilful Perſons who are in your Pariſh, tho as guilty of Treaſon as your ſelves, and offer them to the King to be Officers and Clerks in his Courts? who indeed, as they are untaught in that Art, ſo ſee not their own Guilt, nor ſubmit themſelves to the Mercy of the King, and ſay yet they are capable of Pardon, and to receive the Sallary alſo. <hi>Sir,</hi> All that are to be baptized, are, by virtue of the great Commiſſion of our Saviour, to be firſt taught and made Diſciples by teaching; and take heed you add not to his Word, nor attempt to invert the Order of the Charter and gracious Grant of the King of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth; nor go about, as you do, to make void his Commands by your own Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In <hi>pag.</hi> 15. you ſay,
<q>Infants are not leſs capable of Regeneration of their Nature, than of Remiſſion of Sins, it being certain that no unclean thing can enter into Heaven, that none can be ſaved whoſe Natures are not renewed; either the ſanctifying Grace of God (ſay you) muſt be allowed Infants, or Salvation muſt be denied them. Regenerating Grace is called by St. <hi>John, the Seed of Grace,</hi> 1 John 3.9. No way hinders, but that the Soul of an Infant may be as capable of this Seed, as of a grown

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. I anſwer, Were there not a dangerous Sting in the Tail of ſome of your impertinent Interrogations, I might paſs them all by with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any further Anſwer than I have before given you. Sir, who queſtions the Power of God, who is a <hi>free Agent,</hi> and may do what he pleaſes? He may, 'tis true, regenerate an Infant, or change the Nature of a Child in its Mother's Womb; and may be doth change, or regenerate the depraved Nature of thoſe Infants who die in their Infancy: but who knows what Infants they are he thus works upon, and fits for Heaven? Secret things, I tell you again, belong to him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But ſhould God tell us which Infants Hearts and Natures he hath thus renewed, yet that can be no ground or warrant to us to give them the Sacrament of Baptiſm, no more than the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper; and you know well enough the firſt Fathers of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining Church brought in Infant-Baptiſm to waſh away that Pollution of their Nature, or free them from the Guilt of Original Sin;<note place="margin">Infants had the Lord's Supper for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly given to them.</note> and alſo thoſe Fathers gave the ſame Infants the Lord's Supper, and had indeed as good Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity from God's Word to do the one as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And aſſure your ſelf they ſhamefully er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:44276:45"/>
in both, becauſe both were done without any Warrant or Allowance from God.</p>
               <p>But, Sir, how inconſiſtent are you with your ſelf? even juſt now you tell us that the Infants of Believers are in Covenant with God, (as well as their Parents) and are therefore holy, and from that ground ought to be baptized: But now it ſeems as if that Argument was gone with you, and notwithſtanding that federal Holineſs, they are unclean; and unleſs they have actually ſanctifying Grace, and their filthy Natures are changed, they cannot be ſaved: You juſt play the part of a Fencer, and reſolve to try your Skill with every Weapon, one while you are a Presbyterian, another time a Church-of-<hi>England</hi>-Man. But, Sir, ſpeak, doth Baptiſm change the Nature, or regenerate the Child, or doth it not? the Seed which St. <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks of, he affirms remains in thoſe Perſons in whom it is wrought, ſow'd or infuſed: ſee 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.9.</p>
               <p>And no doubt, was there indeed such a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Habit,<note place="margin">Seed or Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of Grace remains where infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and its Effects will appear.</note> or Seed of Grace infuſed into Infants in their Baptiſm, but it would appear in their Lives when grown up. <hi>Such as is the Cauſe, ſuch is the Effect, or Product</hi> that is produced, <hi>i. e.</hi> if Regeneration was wrought in all the Infants you <hi>Rantize,</hi> Holineſs would be the Effect of it, when they come to Age of Underſtanding; but all Men ſee the contrary, <hi>i. e.</hi> they ſhew their evil and unclean Natures as ſoon, nay, before they can ſpeak plain; therefore you preach falſe Doctrine, if you affirm that Baptiſm renovates or changes their Nature. Nay, and were it so, all that are baptized would be ſaved; Shall one Soul who paſſes through Regeneration miſs of Salvation?</p>
               <p>Reverend <hi>Stephen Charnock,</hi> tho a <hi>Pedo-baptiſt,</hi> ſpeaks more like a Divine and Logician than you do. See his Book on Regenerat. <hi>sol. p.</hi> 75.
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:44276:45"/>
ſaith he,
<q>Many Men take Baptiſm for Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; the Ancients uſually give it this term; one calls our Saviour's Baptiſm, his Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note n="*" place="margin">As if Chriſt paſſed through Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, or change of Nature.</note>: this confers not Grace, but ingageth to it: outward Water cannot convey inward Life: How can Water, an external thing, work upon the Soul in a Phyſical manner? Neither can it be proved, that ever the Spirit o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> God is tied by any Promiſe, to apply himſelf to the Soul in a gracious Operation, when Water is applied to the Body. If it were ſo that all that were baptized were regenerated, then all that were baptized ſhould be ſaved, or elſe the Doctrine of Perſeverance falls to the ground.</q>
And again he ſays,
<q>That ſome indeed ſay that Regeneration is conferred in Baptiſm upon the Elect, and exerts it ſelf afterwards in Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: But how ſo active a Principle as a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Life, ſhould lie dead and aſleep ſo long, even many Years, which intervene between Baptiſm and Converſion, is not eaſily conceiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble?</q>
So far Mr. <hi>Charnock.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis well you call it an imperfect Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Abortive, or a Monſter no doubt; for Baptiſm forms no Child of God: if it did, how come <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> who was baptized, to miſs of Regeneration? <hi>Acts</hi> 8.13. And indeed this is an eaſy way to Heaven; I mean if there is no need of further Regeneration than that poor Babes have in Baptiſm. I know your Church ſaith, that an Infant is made thereby <hi>a Child of God, a Member of Chriſt, and an Inheritor of the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> Sad Doctrine!<note place="margin">Baptiſm makes no Perſons Chriſtians.</note> God deliver <hi>England</hi> from ſuch Guides as teach the common People: Nay, all who will be led or taught by them, that Baptiſm makes them Chriſtians, and ſo never teach them to look after any other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, tho ſuch whom you baptize, as you call it, if they live, when they are grown up,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:44276:46"/>
prove wicked and ungodly Perſons, or carnal Worldlings. Sir, take heed what you do, leſt the Blood of your deceived and miſerable People be required at your hands. Is not this to <hi>heal the hurt of your People ſlightly, and to cry, Peace, Peace, when there is no Peace?</hi> This is the Sting I ſaw in the Tail of your Argument.</p>
               <p>You ask many Queſtions, Why may not this be ſo: and, Why may not that be ſo? Who taught you thus to argue, what do you prove? But that which troubles me moſt is this, <hi>viz.</hi> That after you have put forth theſe unlearned and weak Queſtions, you draw Concluſions therefrom, with daring Boldneſs, after this manner, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <q>What an high Affront then do theſe Men give to the Omnipotency of the holy Spirit, who affirm, that it is as vain a thing to hope and pray, that Almighty God ſhould regenerate an Infant with his holy Spirit, as to expect that he ſhould illuminate a Stone or a Tree? <note n="*" place="margin">Theſe words be cites were wrote by Dr. <hi>Taylor.</hi>
                     </note>
                     <hi>pag.</hi> 16.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>But, ſay you, if Infants are found capable Subjects of regenerating Grace, and Remiſſion of Sin, as, I hope, appears, then ſurely they are capable of Baptiſm; for the outward viſible Sign ought not to be denied to ſuch as are capable of the inward ſpiritual Grace.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Sir, you are to be rectified, Do we deny the Omnipotency of the holy Spirit? none of us never doubted of the Power of the Spirit in regenerating an Infant, if he pleaſes ſo to do; but you are to prove God doth do it, and that by Baptiſm too; for that's the thing you ſeem to contend for, which we deny: we ſay, God can of Stones raiſe up Children to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> if he pleaſes.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We do affirm, you have as much ground of Faith from any Promiſe of God, to pray that God would illuminate a Stone or a Tree, as you
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:44276:46"/>
have to pray God by Baptiſm he would rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate one Infant. If you pray not in Faith, you ſin; and if you have no Promiſe of God to ground your Faith upon, when you pray God by Baptiſm to regenerate an Infant, then you cannot pray in Faith. Two things you are to prove;</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) That God doth require you to baptize Infants.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) Prove that Baptiſm is appointed of God to regenerate Children, or the Adult either, if you can.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I do ſay that Baptiſm doth not belong to them who may be ſaid in a remote ſenſe to be capable of Regeneration; for Unbelievers are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of Regeneration (or elſe ſad is their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition) and are they therefore capable of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm? Baptiſm is not an outward Sign of what a Perſon is capable of, or may have hereafter; but of that thing, or inward ſpiritual Grace the Perſon baptized hath at preſent (or gives ſome evidence of) before, or at the time when he is baptized; and for this I could cite you di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of the Ancient Fathers, and Modern Divines.</p>
               <p>You may be as capable to be a Juſtice of Peace (as far as I know) as you are to be a Preacher? may you therefore give forth War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, and exerciſe that Office?</p>
               <p n="4">4. And laſtly, I muſt tell you, Infants are not in an ordinary way capable of the Image of God, tho they may be capable of Grace and Salvation by Chriſt; becauſe the Image of God conſiſteth in Knowledg, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.10. <hi>And have put on the new Man, which is renewed in Knowledg,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pool's</hi> Annotat.</note> 
                  <hi>after the Image of him that created him.</hi> Hence our <hi>Annotators</hi> tell you, that in Regeneration, or in reſtoring the loſt Image of God, the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding muſt be enlightned; and are Children capable of an enlightned Underſtanding, who
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:44276:47"/>
have no Underſtanding at all? or do you pray God would work Miracles? Would it not be a miraculous thing to ſee a Babe of two or ten days old, to have ſuch Knowledg of God and of Jeſus Chriſt?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But in <hi>Pag.</hi> 16. you argue upon us thus, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <q>Circumciſion was inſtituted for the ſame end that Baptiſm is; and the Party circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, was under the ſame natural Incapacity with the Perſon baptized:</q>
And from hence you charge us with Arrogancy, as if we would make our ſelves wiſer than God.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I anſwer; We have proved Circumciſion was not inſtituted for the ſame end that Baptiſm is, but for ſeveral other Grounds and Reaſons; therefore what you ſay is not true. See our Anſwer.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And does it follow, becauſe God command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Abraham</hi> to circumciſe his Male Infants, that you may command Parents to baptize their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, both Males and Females, who are not the Subjects Jeſus Chriſt has commanded in the New Teſtament to be baptized? And do not you herein make your ſelves wiſer than God? O how juſtly may this Arrogancy be retorted back upon your ſelves!</p>
               <p>Your Brethren,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Athenian Society</hi> ſay Females were cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed by ſome People formerly.</note> the <hi>Athenian Society,</hi> in two or three of their <hi>Mercuries,</hi> tell us, in ſome parts of the World they circumciſe their Females; and no doubt of it, they have as good (or better) Authority ſo to do, as you have to baptize Children. See <hi>Vol.</hi> 7. <hi>Numb.</hi> 7. Where they ſay,
<q>The <hi>Creophagians, Arabians,</hi> ſome of the Deſcendants of <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> did judicially cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſe not only Males but Females. Alſo the <hi>Ethiopians,</hi> eſpecially in the Dominions of <hi>Preſter John,</hi> circumciſe Females.</q>
And for further Information, they direct to <hi>Bartho. de Antiquit. Puerperi, Bellonius, Caelius Rhodoginus,</hi> and ſeveral
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:44276:47"/>
other Hiſtories and Authors. May be they argue as you do, the Females are capable as the Males, of the Benefits of Circumciſion, and therefore may Circumciſe them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Our Argument, I muſt tell you again,<note place="margin">Infants may be capable to be ſaved, and yet not capable Subjects of Baptiſm.</note> lies not ſo much in that Infants are uncapable of any Spiritual Benefit by Baptiſm, (had it pleaſed Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God to have commanded them to be baptized, as he did the Circumciſion of Infants) but in that firſt we cannot find, directly nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>directly, I mean either by Precept, Example, or good Conſequences from all God's Word, 'tis his Mind or Will they ſhould be admitted to Baptiſm.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Becauſe they have not thoſe previous Qualifications, which according to the poſitive and expreſs Law of Chriſt, is neceſſary in all that ought to be baptized; therefore in <hi>p.</hi> 16, 17. you ſet up a Man of Straw of your own making, and then fight with it. Had God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired Infants to be baptized, who could argue againſt their being capable of it? However ſince actual Faith, and the profeſſion of it, is required of all that are to be baptized; we ſay, Infants who are uncapable to act Faith, are not, cannot be proper or fit Subjects for that Sacrament.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe none are to be baptized by virtue of Chriſt's Law and Commiſſion, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. but ſuch who are made Diſciples, by being firſt taught. Infants who are not capable ſo to be made Diſciples, ought not to be baptized. And to theſe two Arguments, we will now ſee your Anſwer, <hi>pag.</hi> 18. of your Book, which is as followeth, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>That a Profeſſion of Faith is neceſſarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired before Baptiſm in all Adult Perſons, that is, Perſons grown up to riper Years, who are (ſay you) the Perſons whom our Saviour meant when he ſaid, <hi>He that believeth, and is baptized, ſhall be
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:44276:48"/>
ſaved</hi>; as moſt evidently appears by the words following, <hi>He that believeth not, ſhall be damned,</hi> Mark 16.16.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>What! muſt all that die in their Infancy go to Hell for an Impoſſibility? The Text only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends ſuch, as by hearing the Goſpel preached, are capable of actual Faith: ſuch as enjoy the Means of Faith, and yet live and die in neglect of Faith, and contempt of Baptiſm, ſhall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be damned; 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3.10. ſays the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>If any Man will not work, neither let him eat</hi>; that is, ſuch as are capable to work, muſt not eat: But muſt Children be ſtarved, becauſe they cannot work? Thus ſay you here, Children lie under a natural Incapacity of profeſſing actual Faith; therefore the firſt Text doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern them any more than the latter.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I. <hi>Sir,</hi> You have given away your Cauſe now for ever. If this Text, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16. does no more concern Infants than that in 2 <hi>Theſſ</hi> 3.10. then be ſure, as they having nothing to do with Faith, ſo have they nothing to do with Baptiſm; for all the Learned generally, as one Man, do and muſt confeſs, the Commiſſion of our Saviour is our great Warrant and Rule for Baptizing; <hi>Therefore</hi> (ſaith Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>) <hi>if we find it not here, where have we it?</hi> Now this in <hi>Mark</hi> contains the Commiſſion of Chriſt, <hi>viz.</hi> who they be that he would have to be baptized, and they are ſuch who believe, (<hi>Matthew</hi> ſays in repeating the words of the ſame Commiſſion) ſuch who are <hi>diſcipled,</hi> or made Diſciples: And you ſay, Infants are no more concerned in this Text, than in that, where the Apoſtle only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends Men, who will not work, which all know doth no ways refer to Children, ſo that the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute might well here end. By your own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, Infants are not concerned in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:44276:48"/>2. You ſay, the Adult are here intended; we ſay ſo too: Whither then will you go for your Infants Right to Baptiſm? We can prove, from many Texts, Infants ought to eat, though they cannot work. But how will you prove Infants ought to be baptized by any other Scriptures, if not from the Commiſſion, though they do not believe, or have not actual Faith?</p>
               <p n="3">3. May you not as well argue thus, <hi>viz.</hi> If Children have mortal Bodies, they muſt be fed at their Parents Table, and eat Bread, though they cannot work. So becauſe they have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Souls, therefore they muſt be fed at the Lord's Table, and eat the Lord's Supper, though they can't believe nor diſcern the Lord's Body by Faith. The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Let a Man examine himſelf, and ſo let him eat</hi>; but this is only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of Adult Perſons, and 'tis ſuch St. <hi>Paul</hi> means: But Infants who are capable to receive ſpiritual Benefit by Chriſt's Death, they muſt have the Medicine alſo; may you not argue thus as well? Pray, <hi>Reader,</hi> obſerve what a kind of Doctrine this Man aſſerts.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>I demand, (ſay you) Whether according to the Mind of God, gathered from the words of the Commiſſion, the Remedy preſcribed ſhould be adminiſtred only to grown Perſons, becauſe they only are capable of underſtanding and believing the Virtue and Efficacy of it? Sure every rational Man among you would conclude his Child capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the Remedy as well as himſelf, altho ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the Virtue that is in it, and only paſſive in the Adminiſtration of it; and that it would be Cruelty, yea Murder in the Parent, to deny the Application of it to all his Children.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply</hi>; I ſtand amazed at your Ignorance and Folly. Does it follow, becauſe Children are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to receive a Medicine againſt the Plague or bodily Diſtemper, are they therefore capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:44276:49"/>
of Baptiſm and the Lord's Supper? If capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of one, ſay I, of the other alſo; for as a Man is required to examine himſelf, and to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the Lord's Body in the Lord's Supper, ſo he is required to repent and to believe in Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that comes to Baptiſm.</p>
               <p n="4">4. I would know how you prove Baptiſm to be the Medicine appointed to cure the Soul of the Plague of Sin? Is not this to blind the Eyes of poor People,<note place="margin">Baptiſm cannot ſave the Souls of Infants.</note> and make them think that an external Ordinance ſaves the Soul? If not thus, how can it be Cruelty, yea Murder, in Parents, to deny the Application of Baptiſm to their Children? The Ancient Fathers, from that in <hi>John</hi> 6.53. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleſs a Man eat the Fleſh of the Son of Man, and drink his Blood, he hath no Life in him</hi>; gave Infants the Lord's Supper, thinking our Saviour (like as the Papiſts do) meant that Sacrament, when indeed he meant only <hi>of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> by Faith on Chriſt crucified.</hi> But however, their Argument for giving Infants one Sacrament, was as good as yours for giving them the other: But when they are as capable to repent and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and are helped ſo to do as they are, and do eat <hi>Bread,</hi> let them have <hi>both Baptiſm</hi> and the <hi>Lord's Supper</hi>; and till then, if God's Word be the Rule of our Faith and Practice, (and not our own Fancies) they ought to have neither; yet the Remedy or Medicine, which is Chriſt's Blood, we deny not, but dying Infants may be capable of.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Sir,</hi> You ſeem to be no true Son of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> for they it ſeems poſitively affirm, <hi>Repentance, whereby a Perſon forſakes Sin, and Faith, whereby he ſtedfaſtly believes the Promiſe of God made to him in that Sacrament,</hi> is required of thoſe who are to be baptized; nay and of little Babes too, therefore the <hi>Sureties</hi> anſwer for them, that they do <hi>believe and repent,</hi> or <hi>forſake
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:44276:49"/>
the Devil and all his Works,</hi> &amp;c. the Child anſwers by Proxy. Your Church baptizes no Child but as a Believer, and a true penitent Perſon. What is this your Argument good for? even nothing. How now, are you wiſer than the Church? no doubt ſhe believes as we do. All that are proper Subjects of Baptiſm, are comprehended in the Commiſſion, and muſt be as ſuch, whether <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dult</hi> or <hi>Infants,</hi> who profeſs Faith and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: But you it may be foreſaw the Snake in the Graſs, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>God-fathers</hi> and <hi>God-mothers</hi> is a Tradition, and none of God's Appointment; nor are they able to perform thoſe things for the Child, which they promiſe for him, and in his Name. And therefore make uſe of another Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, and would have them baptized without Faith, or upon their Parents Faith, of which your Church ſpeaks nothing.</p>
               <p>As to your Compariſon, 'tis not worth men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning: Baptiſm (as I have told you) doth not cure the Soul of Sin, but 'tis the Blood of Chriſt applied by Faith: And now do we ſay, no Child can have the Benefit of that Sovereign Remedy, becauſe not capable to believe, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon Men and Women muſt receive it by Faith, or periſh. <hi>God</hi> (as Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi> obſerves) <hi>may have many ways to magnify his Grace, through Jeſus Chriſt, to them, which we know not of,</hi> who die in their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy, yet have we no Authority to baptize them, any more than to give them the Lord's Supper.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Sir,</hi> You talk at a ſtrange rate, as if you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded not what you ſay or affirm, while you bring Similitudes to teach People to believe Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm is the Balm to cure the Contagion of Sin; and as if the application of it ſaved a little Babe from Hell, and they guilty of murdering the Souls of their Children, who deny to baptize them. I had thought you would not have lain greater
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:44276:50"/>
ſtreſs upon Childrens Baptiſm, than on Childrens Circumciſion, ſince you would fain have them run parallel-wiſe.</p>
               <p>Pray, what became of the Jews Female In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, were they damned? And what became of their Male Infants, who died before eight days old? for they broke God's Law, if they Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed them, (though ſick and like to die) if they were not full eight days old. Bluſh for the ſake of your precious Soul, and take more care for time to come, to what you Preach and Write.</p>
               <p>But to proceed: In <hi>pag.</hi> 19. you ſay,
<q>Tho Children have not actual Faith, yet they have habitual Faith, Faith in <hi>Semine,</hi> and ſo are po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentially Believers. As for Inſtance, Infants have not Reaſon; yet becauſe they have a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, we call them reaſonable Creatures. Thus Infants, whilſt ſuch, have not the Uſe and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of Faith, but have it in the Root, and ſo may be called Believers <hi>initially.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi> clearly confutes this Conceit of yours; <hi>Some there be</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>who argue ſtiffly for Infants having habitual Faith; but</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is there any Precedent, Concomitant, or Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent to this pretended Habit? This ſtrange Invention is abſolutely without Art, without Scripture, Reaſon or Authority.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 2. Why may not the Infants of Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers have the ſame <hi>habitual Faith,</hi> as well as the Infants of Believers? Alſo may not <hi>Pagans,</hi> eſpecially thoſe who may come where the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel is preached, be potentially Believers, and be baptized, before they believe upon the ſame Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument?</p>
               <p n="3">3. If they had the Habit of true Faith, that Habit would appear afterwards, and they would need no other Sacred Habits to be infuſed into them; but we ſee in Infants baptized (as you
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:44276:50"/>
call it) when grown up, the Evil Habits of Sin, but no Sacred Habits of Grace, or Divine Faith, or Seed of Regeneration ſown into them at all. What is in the Root, will ſhew it ſelf in the Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and Fruit; but we having fully anſwered this weak Aſſertion already, ſhall ſay no more to it now.</p>
               <p>You add,
<q>That Infants born within the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom of the Church, of believing Parents, tho Faith of the Parents is to them at preſent, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of an outward Profeſſion in their own Perſons; for (ſay you) though no Child is ſaveable by its Parents Faith, yet the Child is baptizable by virtue of its Parents Faith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Parent receives the Promiſe of God, both for himſelf and his Seed, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.39.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. I anſwer; Let all Men judg of that Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which attends your Arguing and Arguments for Infant-Baptiſm: One while the abſolute Ground and Plea you bring to prove it, is the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham. Sir,</hi> If that will do, and be ſufficient, ſtand by it: but alas you dare not truſt the whole Structure on that crazy Foundation; therefore now you go to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Faith of the Parents, and thus without any Ground or Authority from God's Word, you build your childiſh Practice upon your own Dream: Why not, as your Church teaches, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Faith and Profeſſion of the Sureties? why the Faith of the immediate Parents? Thoſe Texts you mention, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.39. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14. as we ſhall hereafter ſhew, prove not what you here affirm, nor any thing like it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If the Parents Faith will ſerve for the Child,<note place="margin">The Parents Baptiſm may ſerve for the Child, as well as the Parents Faith.</note> why not the Parents Baptiſm ſerve for the Child as well?</p>
               <p>Take again what the Biſhop of <hi>Down</hi> hath wrote on this Argument of yours;
<q>Some ſay (ſaith he) Infants have an Imputative Faith;
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:44276:51"/>
but then ſo let the Sacraments be too; that is, if they have the Parents Faith, or the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, then ſo let Baptiſm be imputed alſo by derivation from them; and as in their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Breaſt, they live upon their Mother's Nouriſhment, ſo they may upon the Baptiſm of their Parents, or their Mother the Church: for ſince Faith is neceſſary to the ſuſception of Baptiſm, (and they themſelves confeſs it, by ſtriving to find out new kinds of Faith to daub the Matter) ſuch as is the Faith, ſuch muſt be the Sacrament; for there is no proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween an actual Sacrament, and an imputative Faith, this being immediate and neceſſary in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to that.</q>
'Thus far Dr. <hi>Taylor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. I wonder (as I have formerly ſaid) what Faith 'tis you ſuppoſe to be in Infants: When will your Trumpet give a certain Sound? Is it the Faith of the Church, as <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> aſſerts, which is intailed upon all who are within the Pale thereof, or in her <hi>Boſom,</hi> to uſe your words? Or is it an imputative Faith from the Parents, as <hi>Muſculus,</hi> you, and others maintain? Or is it the Faith of the Goſſips or Sureties, as your Church ſays,<note place="margin">Various thoughts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Pedo-Baptiſts, what Faith Infants have.</note> 
                  <hi>i. e.</hi> others believe for them?

               <p>See what Confuſion you Pedo-Baptiſts are in. An actual Faith you dare not ſay they have, becauſe they have no Act of Underſtanding: Beſides, how can any Man know they have Faith, ſince he never ſaw any ſign of it? nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

                  <hi>Object.</hi> But then, <hi>Pag.</hi> 19. you bring in our Objection: Infants are not capable of Miniſterial Teaching, therefore not of Baptiſmal Waſhing; becauſe Teaching muſt go before Baptizing, according to the order of the words in our Saviour's Commiſſion, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. <hi>Go, teach all Nations, baptizing them,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Your Anſwer is,
<q>That it is a mighty Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to infer from the order of the words, the neceſſary order of things. St. <hi>Matthew</hi> ſets Teaching before Baptizing; but St. <hi>Mark</hi> ſets Baptizing before Teaching, <hi>Mark</hi> 1.4. ſo that no concluſive Argument can be drawn from hence either way.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, you diſcover a great Abuſe of the ſacred Scripture. Sir, doth St. <hi>Mark, Chap.</hi> 1.4. ſet Baptizing before Teaching?

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Doth this Text, in the order of words, ſay, John <hi>taught Perſons to be baptized, and then to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent?</hi> if what you ſay were true, ſo the order of words muſt have been; and then he had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed taught contrary to our Saviour's Doctrine in the Commiſſion in order of words, as recorded by St. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. 'Tis called, ſaith our Annotators, the Baptiſm of Repentance, <hi>becauſe Repentance was the great thing he taught:</hi> nay, and taught Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance abſolutely neceſſary in all who came to be baptized by him. The order of words are very concluſive here, and muſt not be inverted without palpable danger of God's Diſpleaſure. <hi>John</hi> called upon all who came to his Baptiſm to bring forth Fruits meet for Repentance, and the order of words here do not contradict this; for becauſe Repentance was pre-requiſite to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, it is called the <hi>Baptiſm of Repentance</hi>; and

               <p>Had <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt, our Saviour, or his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles baptized one Infant, or one Adult Perſon, who made no Profeſſion of Faith, the order of words were not ſo concluſive and demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, but that they never did (as we read of.)</p>
               <p>Where therefore the order of Words, and order of Practice go together, and exactly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, they ought not to be <hi>inverted</hi>; and he that doth it, is greatly culpable before God, as I might ſhew in the Adminiſtration of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lord's Supper; the order of words are, <hi>Chriſt firſt took the Bread, and brake it, and then the Cup:</hi> Would any dare to invert this order of words, and firſt take the Cup, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they may as well attempt ſo to do, as to put Baptizing before Teaching.</p>

                  <q>The true reaſon why Chriſt bid his Diſciples firſt teach and then baptize, was, becauſe he was ſending his Apoſtles forth among the Heathen to convert them to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, in which work we all know, that preaching of the Word muſt go before the Adminiſtration of the Sacraments, <hi>Pag.</hi> 20.

                     <hi>proſelyted,</hi> and make a viſible Profeſſion of their Faith, their Children may be baptized, and afterwards inſtructed; as the Children of the Jewiſh <hi>Proſelytes</hi> were firſt circumciſed, and then taught: for tho <hi>Abraham</hi> was firſt taught and then circumciſed, yet <hi>Iſaac</hi> was firſt cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed and then taught: ſo that the ſenſe of our Saviour is this, teach ſuch as are capable of teaching, and baptize ſuch as are capable of Baptiſm.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, firſt, how inconſiſtent is this with what juſt before you aſſerted? Do you not plead for Faith in ſome ſenſe to be in all ſuch, who by virtue of the Commiſſion ought to be baptized, and therefore pretend that Infants have <hi>Habitual Faith,</hi> Faith <hi>in ſemine,</hi> &amp;c. but now plead they may be capable of Baptiſm with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Faith; you alſo contradict what you before ſaid about the order of words. Do you not poſitively now confeſs by the order of the words in the Commiſſion, Teaching ought to go before Baptizing? Sir, 'tis a ſign of a very bad Cauſe that puts you thus to try your Wit, and after all confound your ſelf.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I ask you how <hi>Abraham</hi> (who God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be Circumciſed, <hi>as a Seal of the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of that Faith HE had before circumciſed</hi>) could know he ought to circumciſe his Son <hi>Iſaac,</hi> &amp;c. who had no ſuch Faith, had not God given him an expreſs Command to do it? Had it not been in the words of his Commiſſion, durſt he, think you, have done it? Be ſure if he had, he had ſinned in doing that which God commanded him not: So, and in like manner, ſince our Lord Jeſus expreſly in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, commanded none to be baptized but ſuch who are firſt taught, unleſs he had added, as in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Caſe, <hi>viz.</hi> when <hi>an Heathen is converted to the Faith, and baptized, you may bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:44276:53"/>
his Infants alſo</hi>; how dare you add ſuch Additions to Chriſt's Commiſſion without his Authority, and ſo make the World believe, if you could, our bleſſed Saviour gave forth an imperfect Commiſſion to his Diſciples, which all Men muſt confeſs is the only Warrant and Rule of all Miniſters to act by in the caſe of baptizing to the end of the World? And doth he not ſay, <hi>Add thou not to his Word, leſt he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove thee, and thou art found to be a Liar</hi>; by fathering that on Chriſt which he never ſaid nor intended?</p>
               <p>Suppoſe the King ſhould ſend you with a Commiſſion into a remote Plantation, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand you to act and do exactly according to the expreſs words of the Commiſſion, <hi>not to add to it, nor diminiſh from it,</hi> upon pain of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing caſt out of his Favour, and incur his Wrath and Curſe; durſt you to do otherwiſe in any thing, under pretence it was his meaning, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he plainly and fully in his Commiſſion ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in the Affirmative, how and what you ſhould do in all Matters and things, and forbad you to add thereto?

Who told you what you ſay is the ſenſe of our Saviour? Can any Man once think, ſince the Commiſſion of Chriſt is a pure Goſpel-Commiſſion, and contains <hi>meer poſitive Laws and Rules,</hi> no ways referring to, nor depending on the Law or Command God gave to <hi>Abraham,</hi> that what you ſay can be true, and the Concluſions ſafe, certain, and warrantable? May not another ſay, with as good Authority, that our Saviour commands his Diſciples <hi>to baptize all Nations, both Parents and Children</hi> too, whether they will or not, whether

they believe or not, whether Jews or Gentiles, <hi>Turks</hi> or <hi>Pagans?</hi> I wonder you are not afraid, who take liberty after this ſort to ſport (as it were) and play with, invert, alter and add unto the ſacred Commiſſion of the jealous God, and great King of Heaven and Earth.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We will examine your Similitude, of which you ſeem very full,</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Suppoſe, ſay you, a Perſon, Owner of a great Flock of Sheep, ſhould command his Shepherd to ſhear all his Sheep, and give them an Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark to know them, and he leaves out all the Lambs (which perhaps made up half the Fold) unmark'd; Can the Shepherd be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to have done his Duty? Suppoſe he ſays the Lambs were very young, and uncapable of ſhearing: True, ſays the Owner, but were they not capable of marking.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Infants, ſay you, are not capable of teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but are they not capable of Chriſt's Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark [Baptiſm] by which Chriſt's Sheep are diſtinguiſhed from the Devils Goats? But ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your Principles, Chriſt's Fold has no Lambs in it, but all Sheep, ſuch a Fold as the World never yet heard of. See <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.11.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. I anſwer; this is as weak an Allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or Similitude as ever was brought to il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrate a matter:</p>
               <p>For, firſt, it ſuppoſes that Chriſt gave a very obſcure, dark and doubtful Commiſſion; for if all were to be ſheared that the Shepherd was to mark, the Shepherd could not err in refuſing to mark the Lambs, becauſe not capable of ſhear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; for ſo it is here, all are by Chriſt's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to be firſt taught who are to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized.</p>
               <p n="2">2. You ſuppoſe in Chriſt's Fold there are no <hi>Lambs,</hi> if no Infants are admitted to be of his
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:44276:54"/>
Church or <hi>Flock</hi>; which is abſurd: Were they Infants that Chriſt commanded St. <hi>Peter</hi> to feed, when he bad him <hi>feed his Lambs?</hi> Joh. 21.15. Or, were they Infants that Chriſt is ſaid to <hi>carry in his Boſom?</hi> Iſa. 40.11. The Scripture you cite, <hi>He ſhall feed his Flock like a Shepherd; he ſhall gather his Lambs with his Arms, and carry them in his Boſom.</hi> Do not all <hi>Expoſitors</hi> tell you, by <hi>Lambs</hi> in theſe places are meant <hi>young Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts,</hi> who are by St. <hi>Peter</hi> called <hi>new-born Babes?</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1, 2. and who denies but many ſuch are in <hi>Chriſt's Fold</hi>; and theſe <hi>Lambs</hi> we ſay may and ought to be baptized.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Who told you Baptiſm is Chriſt's <hi>Ear-mark,</hi> by which Chriſt's <hi>Sheep are diſtinguiſhed from the Devils Goats?</hi> I affirm this is no certain and diſtinguiſhing Mark to know the Sheep and Lambs of Chriſt from the Devil's Goats. Was not <hi>Simon Magus</hi> baptized? was that a Mark to know he was a Sheep of Chriſt? Thouſands may be baptized, have that <hi>Ear-mark,</hi> and yet be in the <hi>Gall of Bitterneſs, and in the Bond of Iniquity,</hi> and be the Goats of the Devil. Chriſt himſelf in <hi>John</hi> 10. lays down divers diſtinguiſhing Marks of his Sheep, but makes not the leaſt mention of this. True, when a Believer is baptized, and doth all other things Chriſt had commanded, that is no doubt one mark that he is one of Chriſt's Sheep, but the <hi>diſtinguiſhing Mark is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation,</hi> and that of having his Spirit in our Hearts, and <hi>leading a godly Life. Now if any Man have not the Spirit of Chriſt, the ſame is none of his.</hi> Nom. 8.9.</p>
               <p>As to Infants who die in their Infancy, who doubts but they may be happy, ſince Chriſt ſays, <hi>of ſuch are the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> i. e. Kingdom of Glory? but this is no more ground for you to baptize them, than (as I have often ſaid) to give them the Lord's Supper. Does it
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:44276:55"/>
follow becauſe ſome Infants may belong to the Kingdom of Glory, they are Members therefore of the <hi>viſible Church,</hi> and ſo Lambs of Chriſt's Fold on Earth?</p>
               <p>And this brings me to your next, which is your fourth Argument, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <q>If Infants be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of Chriſt's Bleſſing on Earth, and of his Preſence in Heaven; if they be Subjects of his Kingdom of Grace, and Heirs of his Kingdom of Glory; then they have an undoubted right to the Priviledg of Subjects, amongſt which the Seal of the Covenant is not the leaſt.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. We anſwer, and argue thus to the firſt part of your Propoſition, <hi>viz.</hi> If many of the Jews, and others who were ungodly Perſons, were capable of Chriſt's Bleſſing, <hi>i. e.</hi> of being healed of their bodily Diſeaſes, they were Subjects of Baptiſm: Is this ſound arguing? What further Bleſſing Chriſt did vouchſafe to Infants when he laid his Hands upon them, we know not, for that was the way Chriſt took oft-times in the healing the Sick; and ſo he bleſſed many Perſons that never were baptized as we read of.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We (as I juſt now told you) do deny In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants are Subjects of the viſible Church; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if by the Kingdom of Grace you intend not that, <hi>you beat the Air</hi>; you beg, and prove not; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides it doth not follow. I ſay again, tho Infants may be Heirs of the Kingdom of Glory, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they have an undoubted right to the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges of the Subjects of God's Church; for then it would follow they have right to one Privilege as well as another, and are <hi>to have Fellowſhip with the Saints and Houſhold of God,</hi> as well as Baptiſm.</p>
               <p>But, ſay you, or take the Argument thus, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <q>Thoſe whom Chriſt invites to him, and are received by him, his Miniſters may not refuſe, nor put from them. But Infants are by Chriſt
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:44276:55"/>
invited to him, and were received by him; therefore the Miniſters of Chriſt may not, ought not, durſt not refuſe them into Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with them, <hi>p.</hi> 21.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Chriſt <hi>invited Multitudes to come unto him, and he received them ſo far as to feed them with Barley-Loaves and Fiſhes, and to the Bleſſing of healing them of their bodily Diſtempers:</hi> May his Miniſters therefore receive all ſuch into their Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion?</p>
               <p n="2">2. In the days of Chriſt when he was on Earth, there were many who are ſaid <hi>to come unto him,</hi> whom he might receive into his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and Company, yet his Miniſters might not baptize them, nor receive them into their ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Communion:<note place="margin">Other kinds of coming unto Chriſt in the days of his Fleſh, than what may be ſaid now, <hi>Matth. 22.23, 35.</hi>
                  </note> nor indeed ſo you dare not receive Infants, I mean into your Communion of the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> &amp;c. We read of ſome <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees</hi> and <hi>Lawyers</hi> that came to Chriſt, and he received them into his Company, who, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, came to tempt him. Alſo the <hi>Sadduces</hi> are ſaid to come unto him, <hi>who ſaid there was no Reſurrection</hi>; may Chriſt's Miniſters baptize ſuch and receive them into their Communion?</p>
               <p>Therefore in oppoſition to what you ſay in <hi>Pag.</hi> 21. of your Book, I affirm there was then other ordinary ways of coming to Chriſt than by Admiſſion into his Church; <hi>Chriſt invited the worſt of Sinners to him,</hi> who nevertheleſs did not receive him, therefore there are ſome who muſt be excluded whom Jeſus Chriſt graciouſly invited.</p>
               <p>Your Appeal for Proof of this Argument to St. <hi>Mark</hi> 10.13. <hi>Suffer little Children to come unto me, for of ſuch is the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> doth not your buſineſs; they do not belong to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Grace, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Church; for if they did belong to, or were of the viſible Church, as ſuch; then you need not by Baptiſm make them
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:44276:56"/>
belong unto it: If Chriſt owns them Subjects or Members of his Viſible Church, you by Baptiſm have no need, I ſay, to add them to it; for if as they are the Seed of Believers, they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready (<hi>fidem ſoederis</hi>) not only in Covenant with God, but alſo belong to his Kingdom or Church upon Earth; All the World may ſee you go about but to give them that very Right or Privilege which they had before, and without Baptiſm.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Doth Chriſt (ſay you) take Children into his Arms, and ſhall his Church caſt them out of her Imbraces?</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> May I not argue thus, <hi>i. e.</hi> Doth Chriſt receive all ſorts of Perſons into his Arms of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, to heal their bodily Diſtempers, of which ſome were wicked and ungodly? and ſhall the Church refuſe to receive all ſuch into her Imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces? Beſides, all thoſe pretended Conſequences make no more for Infants to be baptized, than for their receiving the Lord's Supper, and all other Privileges that belong, as well as Baptiſm, to Adult Perſons who believe or are Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Does Chriſt (ſay you) own them for Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of his Kingdom, and ſhall we allow them no better ſtanding than in the Devil's King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Does Chriſt own Infants to be Subjects of his Kingdom, and yet did not baptize them?

But lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Children were brought to Chriſt, and he did not Baptize them, therefore we muſt not:</hi> Here is both Truth and Reaſon in this Argument, as Dr. <hi>Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor</hi> confeſſes, but none of both in yours. You
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:44276:56"/>
your ſelf confeſs Chriſt did not Baptize thoſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants that came to him, and whom he took in his Arms, and bleſſed; becauſe with his own Hands he baptized none at all, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.1, 2.</p>
               <p>Therefore ſince Chriſt, who was God, fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw what <hi>Contention</hi> would ariſe about the Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing of Infants, had it been his Will they ſhould be Baptized, would he not at this time put the Matter out of doubt, have Baptized them, or have given Command to his Diſciples ſo to have done?</p>
               <p>If therefore Infants be in ſo good a Condition as you ſay, <hi>i. e.</hi> Subjects of Chriſt's Kingdom of Grace, let us let them alone, for we cannot, by baptizing them, put them in a better ſtate than they are, without any Warrant from Chriſt; and by baptizing them not, we cannot put them into any worſer ſtate or ſtanding than they are in without it.</p>
               <p>Well, you are angry with us, becauſe we know not but that the Children of <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Infidels</hi> may be in a good condition, as well as Children of Believers, though we deny not, but that the Children of Believers have greater Advantages than the Children of Infidels; namely, by the Prayers, good Education, and the good Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of their Parents, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In <hi>pag.</hi> 22. you ſay,
<q>Can any wiſe or good Man believe, that our Saviour would ſpeak ſuch favourable Words of Infants, and his outward Geſture manifeſt ſo much good-will towards them, only with an intent to enſnare and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive us? doubtleſs it was to encourage his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters to perform all charitable Offices towards them.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. You miſtake, our Saviour ſpeaks ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little concerning Infants, and that which is ſaid of them was accidentally ſpoken, being oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by thoſe who brought little Children
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:44276:57"/>
to him, <hi>which the Diſciples forbad</hi>; and from hence he ſpake what he did. Moreover, the Cauſe why our Saviour ſpoke thoſe words, might be more for the ſake of Parents, that they might not be afraid touching the Condition of their dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Babes, than to ſhew any Ordinance belonged to them: for had it been ſo, doubtleſs the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples would not have forbad thoſe People to bring little Children to Chriſt. 'Tis therefore an Argument againſt Infant-Baptiſm, and not for it, becauſe the Diſciples were appointed by their Maſter to be the Adminiſtrators of that Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, on ſuch to whom it did of right belong; and had Infants been the Subjects, would they have forbid People to bring Infants to him?</p>
               <p n="2">2. You therefore may rather conclude, had they been the Subjects of Baptiſm, Chriſt, by not hinting any ſuch thing in the leaſt on this Occaſion, might rather have left us in a Snare, in ſpeaking nothing of it, neither here, nor at any other time.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Therefore Chriſt ſpeaking ſo favourably of Infants, and yet baptized them not, may teach us to judg favourably of them, and do any cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable Office towards them, but not to preſume to give them holy Baptiſm without Chriſt's War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, no more than any other Goſpel-Ordinance. 'Tis no matter what <hi>Calvin</hi> ſpoke, 'tis no Sin to keep ſuch out of Chriſt's Fold, which he has gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven no Authority to take in: nor have any Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple a more charitable Opinion of the ſtate of dying Infants, than thoſe you call <hi>Anabaptiſts.</hi>

               <p>We read not, the Diſciples baptized theſe lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Children, nor none elſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> To this you anſwer;
<q>Perhaps they were Baptized before: But (ſay you) it doth
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:44276:57"/>
not follow that the Apoſtles did not baptize theſe Children, becauſe no mention of it: the Scripture no where tells us, that the Apoſtles themſelves were baptized; ſhall we conclude therefore that they were never baptized?</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 'Tis no matter whether we read, or read not, that the Apoſtles were baptized, ſince we find it was his Precept and Practice to baptize Diſciples, or ſuch who did believe in him. We read of multitudes of Diſciples that were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, and we know the way of Chriſt was one and the ſame; that which was the Duty of one Diſciple, as a Diſciple, was the Duty of every Diſciple. We read but of two or three Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches who broke Bread, and celebrated the Lord's Supper; could you ſhew us but a Precept for Infant-Baptiſm, or but one Example or Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent where one Infant was baptized, we would not doubt but thoſe little Children might be alſo; but this you cannot do.</p>
               <p>And whereas in <hi>pag.</hi> 23. you ſay,

Baptiſm; then the Jews, before caſt off, might have been admitted to Baptiſm, ſince they had then ſuch a kind of federal Holineſs; which kind of Holineſs you cannot prove Believers Children are ſaid to have under the Goſpel; but if it qualified them not for Baptiſm, it cannot qualify our Children for Baptiſm.

               <p>What if I agree with the laſt, and ſay, <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> is the Root? but what Root? Why the Root of all his true ſpiritual Seed: And if ſo, the Holineſs of the Branches was real, in word, and ſpiritual; for ſuch Holineſs as is in the Root, is in the Branches. And indeed, for want of Faith, or of that real and ſpiritual Holineſs in many of his natural Branches, (for he was a two-fold Root, or Father, as I before have proved) they were rejected, or broken off for their <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief</hi>; and the Gentiles by Faith were grafted in, they having obtained the Fatneſs of the Root, or the Faith and Righteouſneſs of their Father <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> who was the Root or Father of all that believe. The Truth is, as Mr. <hi>Tombs</hi> obſerves,
<q>the Holineſs here meant, is <hi>firſt</hi> in reſpect of God's Election, <hi>Holineſs,</hi> perſonal and inherent in God's Intention, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.4. <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is alſo Holineſs derivative, not from any <hi>Anceſtors,</hi> but <hi>Abraham</hi>; not as a natural Father, but as a ſpiritual Father, or <hi>Father of the Faithful</hi>; and ſo derived from the Covenant of Grace made with <hi>Abraham.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>And thus it appears you have darkened this illuſtrious Scripture, thinking to prove a Holineſs that the New-Teſtament knows nothing of; ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying the <hi>Holineſs and Inſection</hi> to outward Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſations only in the viſible Church, which is meant of ſaving Grace<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Melancthon</hi> in his Commentary upon this place, ſaith thus,
<q>Therefore <hi>Paul</hi> anſwers, that the Marriages are not to be pulled aſunder for their unlike Opinions of God, if the impious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon do not caſt away the other. And for Comfort he adds, as a reaſon, the unbelieving Husband is ſanctified by the believing Wife.

The Connexion of the Argument is this, If the uſe of Marriage ſhould not pleaſe God, your Children would be Baſtards, and ſo unclean: but your Children are not Baſtards; therefore
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:44276:64"/>
the uſe of Marriage pleaſeth God: and how Baſtards were unclean in a peculiar matter, the Law ſhews, <hi>Deut.</hi> Thus far <hi>Melancthon. Came<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarius</hi> gives the ſame ſenſe, as <hi>Chamier</hi> obſerves.</q>

<q>Infants born of ſuch Parents, as one being a Chriſtian, the other not, are legitimately holy; for the Converſion of either Husband or Wife, doth not diſſolve the Marriage which was made when both were in Unbelief.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Nay, I find a very learned Divine to affirm the <hi>Ancients</hi> expounded this place no otherwiſe.

               <p>What we ſay, it appears, is not a racking of the Scripture to maintain a private Opinion, therefore what you ſpeak is not true; and tho the word [holy] refers here to what we affirm with others, yet the Apoſtle ſpeaks truly. Tho 'tis granted the Children of Heathens born in

Arguments from thence I have already anſwered; your Buſineſs is to prove they were admitted into the Goſpel-Church, and that by Baptiſm.

               <p>You come, in <hi>pag.</hi> 26. to the Goſpel-Church. (1.) From the Command of Chriſt. (2.) From the Practice of the Apoſtles. (3.) From the conſtant uſage of the Primitive Church after the Apoſtles.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That Infants were to be admitted into the Chriſtian Church, you ſay, appears from our Saviour's expreſs Command in the words of the Commiſſion, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. <hi>Go, diſciple all Nations, baptizing them</hi>; that is, go and proſelyte all the Gentile Nations, without diſtinction of Country, Sex, or Age whatſoever, make the Goſpel-Church as large as you can.</p>

And that 'tis ſo, I have already proved;</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) From the Practice of Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 4.1. he firſt made Diſciples, and then baptized them.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) From the Practice of the Apoſtles, who always required Faith and Repentance of ſuch, they by virtue of their Commiſſion, did baptize, as <hi>Acts</hi> 2.37. &amp; 8.27. &amp; 10.47.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) From the Nature of the Ordinance it ſelf, it being a ſign of that inward Grace the Perſon baptized ought to have.</p>
               <p n="4">(4.) From the Nature of the Goſpel-Church, it being only built up of living Stones, and to be no larger than Chriſt appointed it.</p>

                  <q>But (ſay you, <hi>pag.</hi> 27.) doubtleſs had our Saviour here intended the excluſion of Infants out of the Viſible Church, he would have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted her with this Alteration, Chriſt being faithful to him that appointed him, as was <hi>Moſes</hi> in all his Houſe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.2.</q>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I muſt retort it back upon you with much better Reaſon: Doubtleſs, ſay I, had our Saviour intended the admiſſion of Infants, he would at this time have acquainted his Diſciples, (and ſo us) that it was his Will they ſhould be received, ſince, as you well ſay, he was ſo faithful, and the rather, becauſe he commanded his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples to receive into his Church ſuch who were taught or made Diſciples. When he commanded <hi>Abraham</hi> to circumciſe his Male-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, <hi>Abraham</hi> knew well enough he was not to circumciſe his Females, though he received no Negative Law in the caſe.

<q>Baptizing Infants appears in the Chriſtian Church (you ſay) from the Practice of the Apoſtles, who baptized whole Families, <hi>i. e. Lydia</hi> and her Houſhold, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.15. the Jay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor and all his, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>And thus it appears to all impartial Perſons, that there is nothing in your ſecond Proof touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

the Practice of the Goſpel-Church; here's no mention made of one Infant baptized, nor the leaſt Colour of Reaſon to conclude there were in thoſe Families.</p>

<q>Search the Scripture, and produce me, ſay you, one Inſtance if you can, from the time St. <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, to the Death of St. <hi>John</hi> the Evangeliſt, which was more than threeſcore Years, during which time many thouſands of Infants were grown up to Maturity, and make it appear they were not baptized in their Infancy, or that their Baptiſm was deferred till riper Years; or that there is any Divine Command for the delaying the Baptiſm of Children of Chriſtian Parents until they are grown up, and I will frankly yield the Cauſe.</q>
                  <hi>Bravely ſpoken!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I muſt retort this Argument back again upon you alſo, and ſhew 'tis a great Argument againſt Infant-Baptiſm, and not for it. For, ſay I, let it be conſidered that ſince there was ſuch a long Space of time as 60 Years, and much lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, between <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> and <hi>the Death of</hi> John <hi>the
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:44276:68"/>
beloved Diſciple,</hi> or <hi>John the Evangeliſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Multitude of Infants born to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers in the Goſpel-Days, yet we read of none of them on their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents Faith were bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed.</note> during which time many thouſands of Infants were born of baptized Believers, both Jews and Gentiles. Now Reader, pray obſerve Mr. <hi>Burkit</hi> ſays in the Goſpel-Day, and when our Saviour ſent his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples firſt to preach, they were to teach or make Diſciples of thoſe they baptized; but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Parents believing and being baptized, he ſays, their Children were admitted to Baptiſm alſo. Now ſay I, ſince many Parents thus taught and baptized, had Multitudes of Infants born to them; How comes it about that we read not of one of their Infants were baptized? no not from the time of <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> to the Death of <hi>John the Evangeliſt?</hi> Can any Man think had any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants been baptized, that God would not have left ſome account of it, to put the matter out of doubt, eſpecially ſince it was never taught do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinally, or commanded? certainly, it could not ſtand conſiſtent with the Care, Wiſdom and Faithfulneſs of Jeſus Chriſt, to have hid and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed ſuch a Practice, had there been one Infant by his Authority or Allowance baptized. But ſince the Scripture is ſilent in it, we may aſſure our ſelves 'tis not the Will of God Infants ſhould be baptized. Alſo if thoſe who were to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, were firſt to be taught, were firſt to repent and believe; then it follows clearly that Baptiſm muſt be deferred till Children were of ripe Years, and able ſo to do.</p>
               <p>We come to what you ſay in <hi>pag.</hi> 28. where you tell us of <hi>a cloud of Witneſſes for Infant-Baptiſm in the Churches after the Apoſtles time.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> And ſo you may if you paſs the firſt 2 or 3 hundred Years after Chriſt; and many Errors be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides which crept amain into the Churches.

               <p>The firſt is <hi>Voſſius,</hi> a later Writer, I know not but you may have <hi>Ireneus</hi> and St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> out of him: I do confeſs <hi>Ireneus</hi> lived not above 200 Years after Chriſt, or in the ſecond Century. Thus you and others cite him, <hi>viz. Omnes venit Chriſtus per ſemetipſum ſalvare, omnes qui per eum renaſcuntur ad Deum Infantes &amp; parvulos juniores &amp; ſeniores.</hi> In Engliſh thus,
<q>Jeſus Chriſt came to ſave all by himſelf, all who by him are born again unto God, Infants and little ones, Young and Old.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kit</hi>'s Proof of Infant-Baptiſm from <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neus,</hi> is by uncertain Conſequence.</note>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Reader, pray obſerve here is not a word of one Infant baptized, but Mr. <hi>Burkit</hi> infers it from his Words; ſo that we have nothing but Conſequence yet, neither from God's Word, nor the Words of Man. Chriſt no doubt came to ſave ſome of all ſorts of Men; and who doubts but he came to ſave Infants and little ones, young and old? But why muſt thoſe Words, <hi>who are born again,</hi> be applied to Infant-Baptiſm.</p>
               <p>The Scope of <hi>Ireneus</hi> in that Chapter is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute the <hi>Groſticks,</hi> who ſaid that Chriſt did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed one and thirty Years of Age; againſt whom <hi>Ireneus</hi> alledged that Chriſt lived in every Age, of Infancy, Youth, Old and Age; that by his Age and Example, he might ſanctify every Age. So that here <hi>Ireneus</hi> ſpeaks not of being born again by Baptiſm: for he ſaith, <hi>Omnes inquam qui per eum renaſcuntur in Deum; i. e.</hi> I ſay all which are born again by him to God, <hi>i. e.</hi> by Chriſt; not as if he had baptized Infants, but becauſe he, (<hi>i. e.</hi> Chriſt) was an Infant, that by the Example or Vertue of his Age, he might ſanctify Infants, as
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:44276:69"/>
the whole Diſcourſe in Latin plainly ſhews, <hi>viz. Magiſter ergo exiſtens, Magiſtri quoque habebat aeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, non reprobans nec ſupergrediens hominem, neque ſolvens ſuam legem in ſe humani generis, ſed omnem aetatem ſanctificans per illam, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. As to <hi>Cyprian,</hi> he lived, as I find it in Hiſtory, about 248, or 300 Years after Chriſt: and ſhould I tell the Reader what Corruptions and Errors were let in about that time, he would not won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to hear Infants were allowed Baptiſm: yet we have <hi>Cyprian</hi> againſt <hi>Cyprian.</hi> It is true, as far as I can gather, in his time Infant-Baptiſm was firſt introduced, without any Ground or Warrant from Chriſt, and it was as ſtrongly oppoſed, which appears by the Debates and Doubts about it.</p>
               <p n="3">3.

If you come but a little lower, you have Proof enough in the <hi>Popiſh Councils, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees and Canons.</hi> But 'tis to be obſerved, that thoſe Fathers pleaded for Infant-Baptiſm, <hi>as that which took away Original Sin, and gave Children the Euchariſt too</hi>; in the firſt Sacrament abuſing that Text, <hi>John</hi> 3.5. and in the other, that in <hi>John</hi> 6.53. Theſe are all your humane Proofs from the Churches after the Primitive Apoſtolical Days, which you bring; and I doubt not but to give you better and more <hi>Authentick Authority</hi> from ſome of the <hi>ancient Fathers</hi> againſt Infant-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, than you have brought for it, and ſome of them nearer the Apoſtles Days too.

We may by this perceive from whence <hi>the Original of our old Church-Catechiſm came.</hi> But this is a clear Argument, ſaith the Doctor, to prove of old the Perſons who were to be baptized, asked themſelves Baptiſm in their own Names, of their own choice, and profeſs their own Faith.</p>

<q>If it was a groſs Error in the Primitive Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to admit Infants to Baptiſm, then they in ſuffering ſuch an Error to paſs uncenſured and uncondemned, were guilty of the greateſt Impiety, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> What then? I ask you, whether you do not believe for ſeveral Centuries thoſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers who admitted Infants to the Lord's Supper without <hi>cenſuring</hi> or <hi>condemning</hi> it, were not guilty alſo of as great Impurity? Beſides, did not the ſame Fathers hold other Errors? ſee Mr. <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin</hi>'s Demonſt. of the Problem, <hi>pag.</hi> 488. theſe are his words, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <q>And whereas ſome Fathers, viz. <hi>Ireneus, Juſtin, Clement, Tertullian,</hi> held that the Law of Nature had Power to ſave the Gentiles without Chriſt.</q>
And again he ſaith,
<q>The Fathers have Errors, yea, and that ſometimes groſs ones.</q>
Doth not Hiſtory tell us the Fathers uſed other Rites alſo, and that in Baptiſm? See <hi>Perkins,</hi> p. 549.
<q>The Fathers, ſaith he, uſed ſome other Rites and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies which are now omitted, as <hi>kiſſing of the Child</hi> which was baptized, in <hi>Cyprian, l.</hi> 3. <hi>ep.</hi> 8.

It was an uſe for the Baptizer to blow in the Face of the baptized, and the Party baptized uſed to exufflate the Devil, whom he renounced. What Credit is to be given to ſuch Fathers? They gave the Euchariſt to Children likewiſe.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Shewing Infant-Baptiſm is of no uſe at all, in oppoſition to what Mr.</hi> Burkit <hi>affirms, but contrariwiſe ſinful,</hi> i. e. <hi>it being an Error, hath alſo many evil and bad Conſequences attending it.

               </argument>
               <p>
                  <q>YOU ſay, the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> aſſert Infant-Baptiſm is unlawful, becauſe 'tis unuſeful, Children underſtanding no more than <hi>Brute Beaſts</hi> what is done to them; therefore you may as warrantably baptize a <hi>Beaſt</hi> as a Child, <hi>Pag.</hi> 34. And then ſay, <hi>pag.</hi> 35. That Infant-Baptiſm is greatly advantagious as an Act of Initiation into the viſible Church.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. You have no Warrant to baptize a Child; but who of the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> ever ſaid ſuch words as you here mention? dare you accuſe your Neighbours falſly? 'tis a bad and unſeemly Compariſon. But 'tis no marvel we meet with it from ſuch as you who are preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced againſt us: ſome of your Brethren for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:44276:76"/>
charged us with baptizing naked. God will judg between us and you in his due time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 2. You ſhould have proved it an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, or an Appointment of Chriſt; but that you have not yet done, nor never will. True, were Infant-Baptiſm ordained by Chriſt to be an initiating Rite into the Goſpel-Church, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it had been uſeful.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But what good doth your baptizing them do them? what Priviledge of the Church do you allow them? I know not one; if indeed it did adopt the Child to be a Son or Daughter of God, you ſay ſomething; or if God had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed it to be a Sign or Token of it; but this he hath not done, and 'tis not in your Power to do it.</p>
               <p n="1">1.
<q>But you ſay they have hereby Intereſt in all the Prayers put up in and by the Church.</q>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> If you ſo pray for them, <hi>viz.</hi> as Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the viſible Church, what ground have you to believe God will hear you, ſince he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver made them Members thereof? Beſides, the Church prays for all her Members, and for the Children of them who are Members, that they in due time may become Members, and have equal Right in all the Bleſſings of God's Church, if it be his Will to bring them in. But what ground have you to deny any who are true Members of the Church, the Euchariſt, or Lord's Supper, or any other Priviledge whatſoerver?</p>
               <p n="2">2.

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> No doubt but Chriſt exerciſes his Care over <hi>poor Infants,</hi> but not the more, aſſure your ſelf, for your baptizing them without his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>

                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:44276:76"/>3.
<q>You ſay, hereby the Church ſtands nearer to them than to the reſt of Mankind, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> mentioning that Text in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.13. <hi>Thy Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſhall be all taught of God,</hi> &amp;c.</q>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Is this indeed the Love you Pedo-baptiſts have to your poor Infants? What, bring them into ſuch a Covenant, without their Knowledg or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, or God's Appointment, and then threaten them, if they break it, with <hi>Hell and Damnation,</hi> and what not!</p>
               <p>Do you know they are all <hi>Elect Perſons,</hi> and ſo ſuch that God will in time call, give Grace to, and ſo change their evil and depraved Natures? If not, do you not heap up a <hi>Multitude of Evils up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them,</hi> and hereby make their Condition worſe, or aggravate their Sin and Miſery for ever?</p>
               <p>I know not whether you be of this <hi>Pedo-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt's</hi> Mind, or not; but I think this Doctrine does not fit a <hi>Chriſtian Catechiſm:</hi> if God had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired Infants to enter into ſuch a Covenant, ſome reaſon he might have thus to ſpeak:<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liams</hi> wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of blame as well as Mr. <hi>Burkit.</hi>
                  </note> But ſince he nor you either can prove it, this to me ſeems a daring boldneſs in a Miniſter of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel to aſſert, (who I hope <hi>is a good Man</hi>). God I grant expects, that <hi>all true Believers</hi> ſhould per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form their Baptiſmal Covenant, but then know they are required of God actually to enter into it; they freely of their own choice enter into it, they are ſuch God hath given habitual Grace to perform it. And he hath promiſed them alſo a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſupply of Grace to enable them ſo to do; but nothing of this you can prove, in Infants cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanting in their Baptiſm, (but more of this by and by); nor will their <hi>Sureties</hi> help the matter, for if they cannot perform thoſe things they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe for themſelves, how ſhould they be able to do it for others? beſides 'tis an humane Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and not appointed of God, as Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> himſelf confeſſeth.</p>
               <p>But truly Mr. <hi>Williams</hi>'s Doctrin afflicts my Mind: Strange! is this Sin the <hi>damning Sin?</hi> I thought
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:44276:77"/>
the damning Sin (by way of eminency) had been the Sin of Unbelief: Suppoſe your own Child ſhould not believe he is bound by virtue of that <hi>baptiſmal Covenant</hi> you brought him into, but when grown up, diſowns that (you call) <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,</hi> &amp;c. not believing it is a Truth of Chriſt, muſt he be damned?</p>
               <p>But to proceed;</p>
               <p>You having ſhewed the Advantages of Infant-Baptiſm, without giving one Scripture-Text to prove what you ſay is true; you, in <hi>pag.</hi> 38. come to ſhew, that Baptiſm is more uſeful and beneficial to a Child in Infancy, than to omit it till riper Age; <hi>Becauſe no Infant-memberſhip is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Hypocriſy, which Perſons grown up are.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Then give them the <hi>Lord's Supper</hi> alſo, for doubtleſs if they <hi>receive it,</hi> they will <hi>not eat and drink their own Damnation,</hi> as may be ſome, that have it given to them, do. I tremble at what you dare to ſay and write, in which you ſeem to arraign the Wiſdom of the ever-bleſſed Jeſus; Hath he appointed <hi>Believers,</hi> or Adult Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who are gracious, to be baptized, and none elſe? and do you ſay, the Ordinance better ſuits with <hi>ignorant Babes?</hi> Should you dictate to your <hi>earthly Prince,</hi> would he allow it? much leſs to contradict and correct him, as if your Wiſdom was more than his.</p>
               <p n="2">2. You ſay,
<q>'Tis more advantagious to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, than thoſe of riper Years; as it is a pre-engagement upon them to reſiſt Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> You may after this rate bring them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an hundred Engagements and Covenants, nay, may be more plauſible ones too, may you not? When they know what they do, make them take <hi>a ſolemn Oath,</hi> or <hi>enter into Bonds,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on pain of <hi>ſevere Puniſhment,</hi> that they ſhall not yield to Temptations, and pretend 'tis God's
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:44276:78"/>
Law they ſhould do ſo; and if you can deceive their Judgments, they will dread as much (nay, may be more) the breaking thoſe <hi>Oaths</hi> and <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants,</hi> than this you bring them into, without any Authority from Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. You ſay,
<q>Baptiſm in Infancy is more advantagious than at riper Years, as it is an early Remedy againſt the Malady of Original Sin.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Speak; Doth Baptiſm take away <hi>Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Sin,</hi> or free them of that <hi>Malady,</hi> or not? You know, ſome of the <hi>Ancient Fathers</hi> were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away with ſuch a Dream; how comes it to paſs then, that that <hi>Contagion</hi> appears ſo ſoon, and to be as ſtrong in your Children as in ours, who never were baptized at all? But does not St. <hi>Peter</hi> tell you, (1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.20.) <hi>Baptiſm waſhes not away the Filth of the Fleſh?</hi> Or is not Original Pollution a Filth of the Fleſh? what Stuff is this you would force upon us, and the World! We affirm Infants are no more capable of this Ordinance than any other. Why do you ſay of no Rite but this? We <hi>challenge all the World,</hi> by God's Word, to prove they are capable of Baptiſm, any more than of the Lord's Supper.</p>
               <p n="4">4. You ſay,
<q>Baptiſm adminiſtred to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, has this Advantage, That it puts the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian upon more bitter mourning for actual Sin, from the conſideration of that ſhameful Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury and wilful Apoſtacy that is found in ſuch Perſons Sin.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. I find you are one of Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> his <hi>Brethren,</hi> i.e. you are of his Belief it ſeems: but tremble at the thoughts of the Conſequences of your Doctrine.<note place="margin">The Danger of Infants Baptiſmal-Covenant laid open.</note> Have not your Children, when grown up, enough Sins to mourn for and bewail before Almighty God, but you muſt bring them into a Covenant which you knew they would break when they come to riper Age? and

ſuch is the <hi>pravity of human Nature,</hi> there is no avoiding of it without a ſupernatural Work of Grace; their Burden is heavy enough, you need not add to it.</p>
               <p n="2">2.

Alas, their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Baptiſm never brought them one ſtep nearer to God, than thoſe Children are who never were baptized in their Infancy at all: where then is the <hi>Apoſtacy</hi> you ſpeak of?</p>

               <p n="1">1. Conſider, as I ſaid before;</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) That all Believers God himſelf doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire or command in his Word to enter into this <hi>Baptiſmal Covenant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">(2.) And they, before they enter into it, have a <hi>Principle of Divine Life infuſed into their Souls,</hi> or <hi>Grace implanted in their Hearts,</hi> having paſſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Work of Regeneration, being dead to Sin, (of which Baptiſm is a lively Symbol) or is, as your Church ſays, <hi>an outward Sign of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſpiritual Grace.</hi> Not as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> obſerves, a Sign or Symbol of <hi>future,</hi> but of <hi>preſent</hi> Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; which is confirmed by what St. <hi>Paul</hi> teaches, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.2. <hi>How ſhall we that are dead to Sin, live any longer therein?</hi> not, may be dead, but <hi>are dead,</hi> and <hi>ſo are buried with Chriſt in Baptiſm,</hi> verſ. 3, 4. If you ſay, all Adult Perſons baptized are not converted, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I anſwer, They appear ſo to be, and as ſuch, voluntarily enter into this Covenant: beſides, God does not require them without Faith to do it. Baptiſm doth not only repreſent the Death and Burial of Chriſt, but alſo ſignifies our Death to Sin, or that bleſſed Work of Mortification of the Body of Sin and Death; by which means Believers who enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this Baptiſmal Covenant, are put into a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and meet capacity to perform that ſacred Obligation; but ſo are not Infants.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) That every true Believer baptized, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders, ponders upon, and weighs with all ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and deliberation imaginable, the Nature of this Covenant before he ſigns it. And,</p>
               <p n="4">(4.) That he doth it freely, voluntarily, and with his full liking, approbation and conſent: neither of which do, nor can do thoſe poor In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants you force to enter into this Covenant.
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:44276:80"/>
Theſe things conſidered, it appears, as it is a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Act in you to bring them into this Covenant (ſince 'tis done without Command or Authority from God) ſo 'tis cruelty alſo towards your own Babes, by making them to be come guilty of <hi>Perjury,</hi> and thereby damning (as Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> ſays) their own Souls.</p>
               <p n="5">(5.) Conſider, every true Believer that is liſted under Chriſt's Banner, by entring into this Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſmal Covenant, is by Chriſt compleatly armed, <hi>i. e.</hi> he hath the Chriſtian Armor put upon him, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. he has the <hi>Breaſtplate of Righteouſneſs, the Shield of Faith,</hi> and for an <hi>Helmet, the Hope of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi>; and the <hi>Word of God,</hi> like a <hi>Sword in his Hand,</hi> to cut down all his Enemies. Thus by the help of theſe Sacred Graces of the Spirit, he is enabled to fight againſt Sin, the World, the Fleſh, and the Devil. But alas, you liſt your poor Babes into this War, and make them cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and vow to <hi>forſake the Devil and all his Works, the Pomps and Vanities of this Wicked World, and all the ſinful Luſts of the Fleſh</hi>—but arm them not. Did Baptiſm confer Grace, and <hi>arm</hi> their Souls, it was ſomething; but who dares aſſert that? or if he does, who will or can believe him?</p>
               <p n="6">(6.) God hath alſo promiſed to aſſiſt, ſtand by, help and enable all Believers baptized, with further ſupplies of Grace; nay, they being actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally united to Chriſt, have his bleſſed Influences flowing to them, beſides the Promiſes of God, <hi>the Death, Reſurrection,</hi> and <hi>Interceſſion of Chriſt</hi>; and the <hi>everlaſting Covenant of Grace,</hi> which is ordered in all things, and ſure, <hi>firmly ſecures all their Souls:</hi> But thus it is not with thoſe poor Babes you bring into this Covenant; you are like <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s <hi>Task-maſters,</hi> command the making of <hi>Brick,</hi> but allow them no <hi>Straw.</hi>

                  <pb n="151" facs="tcp:44276:80"/>4. Again, conſider how hereby great part of the Nations are perjured: I will appeal to the Conſciences of all thinking and underſtanding People, whether, according to your Principle and Practice, it is not ſo; <hi>Mourn O</hi> England <hi>and lament, ſad is thy Caſe!</hi> If theſe Men ſpeak right or truly, what a Multitude in thee have been made to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into this Covenant, who never performed it? O Perjured Nation! Perjured People! and Perju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Paſtors! for ſo are all thy debauched, drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, ſwearing and unclean Teachers. Are not theſe perjured alſo? Have they kept their Vow and Covenant? Alas, Sir, inſtead of mourning for this Sin, we may conclude they never thought of it. But let them break off their Sins by Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs; I mean, repent and leave thoſe groſs Acts of Wickedneſs, of which many, both Prieſt and People, are guilty, and get renewing Grace, and never let them fear this new deviſed Sin of <hi>Perjury.</hi> For if God's Word convinces of all Sins, and doth not convince of this ſort of <hi>Perjury,</hi> this is no <hi>Perjury</hi>; (I mean the ſimple breaking of that Covenant, though thoſe Sins by which they are ſaid to break it, are horrid Treaſon and Rebellion againſt the God of Heaven, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke him to Wrath every Day.) But God's Word doth convince of all Sins, and doth not convince of this ſort of <hi>Perjury</hi>; therefore it cannot be <hi>Perjury,</hi> as is affirmed. 'Tis not this which is the <hi>Self-killing-Murder, the damning Sin:</hi> No, no; but 'tis their Unbelief and Contempt of God's Grace, or neglecting the great Salvation offered by Chriſt in the Goſpel.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Baptiſm adminiſtred in Infancy hath</hi> (you ſay) <hi>this ſingular Advantage above that which is adminiſtred at viper Age, in that it gives the pious Parent a good ground of hope that his Children dying in Infancy, are certainly ſaved, it makes</hi> (ſay you) <hi>that Ordinance a Channel of Grace,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="152" facs="tcp:44276:81"/>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. This is like the reſt: But, Sir, by what Authority do you aſſert all theſe things? You know what wonderful Vertue the <hi>Papiſts</hi> ſay is in many of their <hi>Popiſh Rites, Ceremonies</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, i. e.</hi> in their <hi>croſſing themſelves,</hi> and in their <hi>Holy Water,</hi> eſpecially in their <hi>Agnus Dei:</hi> but how do they prove it? even as well as you do what you ſpeak here upon this Account. And we have the ſame reaſon to believe them, as to believe you in what you ſpeak without Proof or Authority from God's Word.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Pious Parent!</hi> But alas, how few are there of that ſort? what hopes hath the impious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane and ungodly Parent of the Salvation of his dying Children?<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Burkit</hi> leaves impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Parents without hope of the Salvation of their dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Infants.</note> But, Sir, I thought all the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and believing or godly Parents Children, were born in Covenant with God; and that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents Faith would have ſecured them, whether baptized or not. Were not the Jews Female Children ſaved? they were not circumciſed; and were not their Male Infants ſaved, who died be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the eighth Day?</p>
               <p n="3">3. From what Scripture is it theſe pious, though ignorant and deceived <hi>Parents,</hi> may have hope that their Children that die in their Infancy ſhall be ſaved, and none but theirs, who are bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized or rather rantized?</p>
               <p n="4">4. Will you make Baptiſm their Saviour? can Baptiſm ſave them? And is it ſo indeed? is it then in the Power of Parents to ſave or damn their Children? And how came Baptiſm to have ſuch Power in it? or who made that <hi>a Channel of Grace to dying Infants?</hi> Do you not place that Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue in an external Rite, that only belongs to the Blood of Chriſt, and ſanctifying Grace of God's Spirit?<note place="margin">Perkins <hi>on</hi> Gal. cap. 3. p. 256.</note> Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> ſaith,

               <p n="5">5. May not this Doctrine of yours clearly tend to <hi>ſcare</hi> and <hi>afright</hi> poor Parents with fear that all their Babes that die in their Mother's Wombs, or before baptized, are damned? And O in what a ſad Condition are all the Children of ungodly and impious Perſons, whoſe little Babes you dare not, cannot baptize, if you are true to your own Principles? But that Text may give us a better ground of hope a thouſand times concerning the well-being of our dying Infants, where our Saviour ſaith, <hi>of ſuch are the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> And that which you mention, <hi>I ſhall go to him, he ſhall not return to me</hi>; together with the infinite Mercy of God, through the Virtue of Chriſt's Blood, who can convey Help and Healing to dying Infants and <hi>Idiots</hi> in ways we know not of; nor are we to trouble our ſelves about ſuch ſecret things that are not revealed.</p>

               <p>AS touching your laſt five Arguments, againſt Rebaptizing, I ſee no ground to except a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt what you ſay there; only I ſhall take a brief view here of your ſix General Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>p.</hi> 49.</p>
               <p>And as to you firſt, I have,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Burkit</hi>'s firſt Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.</note> and ſhall yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther make it appear, that Dipping is not an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, but an eſſential part of Baptiſm, <hi>viz.</hi> 'tis no Baptiſm at all, if not done by <hi>Immerſion, or Dipping.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2<hi>ly,</hi> Whereas you ſay,<note place="margin">His ſecond Propoſition.</note> the way or
<q>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of applying Water is not poſitively deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined in the Holy Scripture, cannot be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered either from the ſignification of the Word, or from the ſignificancy of the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This, as to the firſt part, <hi>viz.</hi> as to the ſignification of the Greek word, we have fully confuted; and as to the ſignificancy of the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, we ſhall forthwith in this Chapter make moſt evidently appear.</p>
               <p>3<hi>ly,</hi> You ſay,<note place="margin">His third Propoſition.</note>
                  <q>There is a probability that Baptiſm was adminiſtred in the Apoſtles Times by Immerſion or Dipping, ſo there is likewiſe a probability that it was done by Aſperſion or Sprinkling.</q>

                  <q>You ſay you do not oppoſe the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of Dipping in ſome caſes, but the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of Dipping in all caſes.</q>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> We have and ſhall prove the neceſſity of Dipping in all caſes, and that 'tis no baptiſm at all if not ſo done, let your Church ſay what ſhe pleaſes.</p>

                  <note place="margin">His fifth Propoſition.</note>
                  <q>You ſay, that none ought to put a Divine Inſtitution upon any Rite at their own <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This makes againſt your ſelf, and <hi>all Pedo-baptiſts</hi> in the World. How dare you change a Divine Inſtitution of Jeſus Chriſt? change his Law and holy Ordinance, and ſubſtitute another thing in its ſtead and room? And if the Laws and Inſtitutions of Chriſt in their own nature are not unchangeable, what may not Men do and yet be blameleſs? this opens a door to make all Chriſt's Inſtitutions <hi>null and void.</hi> But, Sir, we have ſhewed in this Treatiſe, that for 1300 Years, in moſt parts of the World, Immerſion was only uſed; and ſome learned <hi>Pedo-Baptiſts</hi> have ſhewed that Rantiſm is utterly to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, as an Innovation, and an inſignificant Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony.</p>

                     <note place="margin">His ſixth Propoſition.</note> That in the Sacraments it is not the Quantity of Elements, but the Significancy of them that ought to be attended; in Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion it was not the Quantity of Fleſh cut off ſo much as the Signification of it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> In the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper we grant 'tis not the Quantity of Bread and Wine is to be obſerved, if ſo be it be admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred in that order and manner Chriſt hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, <hi>viz.</hi> to repreſent his Body broken, and his Blood poured forth. The like we will ſay alſo in Baptiſm, we need not go where there is more Water than what will ſerve to baptize, or dip the Perſon all over, ſo that it may repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the Burial and Reſurection of Chriſt, which was the very thing it was appointed to hold forth, or repreſent when adminiſtred.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Should the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> (as I have ſhewed) in Circumciſion only have cut a little bit of the fore-skin of the Fleſh, and not round, or quite off, or only have paired off the Nails of the Childrens Fingers with a little Skin with it, would that have anſwered the Mind of God in that Rite? or they have been born with, in pleading, it might as well anſwer Circumciſion in Signification? The <hi>Vanity</hi> and Sinfulneſs of this Aſſertion you will ſee fully in this Chapter laid open and detected. But I ſhall now proceed to your firſt Argument againſt Dipping.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>But ſprinkling or pouring Water upon the Party baptized without Dipping, is by the Spirit of God in divers Scriptures expreſly called baptizing.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Therefore it is lawful and ſufficient, and Dipping is not neceſſary.</q>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> That the primary literal, proper and genuine Signification of the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is to dip, we have abundantly proved by a great Cloud of learned Witneſſes; and this indeed I ſee you dare not deny, ſaying in <hi>Pag.</hi> 51. that the Primitive Word <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, from whence comes <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ſignifies to dye, or give a new Colour. All know that which is dyed in the Dyers Fat is dipped all over; but whereas you ſay it ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies alſo ſometimes to waſh, we have ſhewed 'tis no other waſhing than is by a total dipping or plunging the Thing or Perſon all over in Water. And therefore now, to proceed, I ſhall further prove Baptiſm is no other Act but Dipping, or burying the Body under the Water.</p>
               <p>You ſay, <hi>Pag.</hi> 52.
<q>We read of divers Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings under the Law, in the Original it is divers Baptiſms: Now, ſay you, what were thoſe Waſhings but Sprinklings, no Perſons were dipp'd in Blood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> We deny thoſe Waſhings which are called Baptiſms, were either ſprinkling or pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Water on them, but total dipping of their whole Body;<note place="margin">Ainſworth <hi>his Annotat. on</hi> Levit. 11.32.</note> and ſo the Reverend Mr. <hi>Ainſworth,</hi> (a Man very learned in all Jewiſh Rites and Ceremonies) poſitively affirms on <hi>Levit.</hi> 11.31. theſe are his words, <hi>viz.</hi>

But, Sir, where we read of ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of Blood, the word is not there baptizing.

                  </gap>rom the ſpiritual Signification thereof, or what in a lively Figure or Symbol is held forth thereby.</p>
               <p>And firſt, to proceed; let it be in the fear of God conſidered, that as the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper doth in a lively Figure repreſent the breaking of Chriſt's Body, and the pouring forth of his precious Blood; ſo and in like manner the Sacrament of Baptiſm doth ſignify and hold forth the Death, Burial and Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the ſame Lord Jeſus Chriſt: and the holding forth and confirming of theſe two great Goſpel-Truths, was doubtleſs the end of our Saviour in ordaining both theſe Goſpel-Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, that ſo Chriſt crucified, with his Burial and Reſurrection, might not only in the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of the Word be preach'd to the hearing of our Ears, but by theſe two Inſtitutions be alſo preach'd (as it were) to the ſeeing of our Eyes. And that Baptiſm doth hold forth this, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with our Death unto Sin, and riſing again to walk in newneſs of Life, I ſhall prove in the next place; and that,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> From expreſs places of Scripture.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> By the Conſent, Agreement and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of a Cloud of Witneſſes, both <hi>Ancient Fathers,</hi> and <hi>Modern Divines,</hi> and worthy <hi>Proteſtant Writers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt Scripture is, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.3, 4, 5, 6. <hi>Therefore we are buried with him in Baptiſm,</hi> &amp;c. The Saints or whole Church of the <hi>Romans</hi> were to reckon themſelves dead to Sin, and
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:44276:94"/>
bound to live no longer therein, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by Baptiſm, as in a lively Figure, they held forth the ſame thing.</p>
               <p>So that it appears Baptiſm hath a twofold Signification.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) There is in it, when truly and rightly adminiſtred, not only a Repreſentation of Chriſt's Buri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> and Reſurrection. But,</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) Alſo it ſignifies our Death unto Sin, and our riſing again to walk in newneſs of Life. And indeed the Apoſtle makes uſe of this as an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to preſs newneſs of Life (the thing ſignified in Baptiſm) upon them all—As if he ſhould ſay, As many of us as are baptized, muſt know this, that we were baptized into Chriſt's Death, and therefore muſt die to Sin, and live a ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Life: But we have all been baptized, or buried with him in Baptiſm; therefore muſt all of us die to Sin, and live a new Life.</p>
               <p>Our <hi>late Annotators</hi> on the place ſay thus,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pool</hi>'s An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notat.</note> He ſeems to allude to the manner of baptizing in thoſe warm Countries, which was, ſay they, to dip or plunge the Party baptized, and as it were to bury him for a while under Water.</p>

Now becauſe none are buried but dead Men— from this very thing, that we are buried in Baptiſm, we are aſſimilated to Chriſt buried, or when he was buried.</p>

The out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Rite in Baptiſm is three-fold:

                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>The Form of Baptiſm, <hi>viz.</hi> external and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential, is no other than the Analogical Proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which the Signs keep with the things ſignified thereby: for the Properties of the Water waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away the Defilements of the Body, does in a moſt ſuitable Similitude ſet forth the Efficacy of Chriſt's Blood, in blotting out of Sin; ſo dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the Water, in a moſt lively Similitude, ſets forth the Mortification of the Old Man; and riſing out of the Water, the Vivification of the New Man. The ſame plunging into the Water, ſaith he, holds forth to us that horrible Gulph of Divine Juſtice, in which Chriſt for our ſakes, for a while, was in a manner ſwallowed up; abiding under the Water, (how little time ſoever) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes his Deſcent into Hell <note n="*" place="margin">Or Grave.</note>, even the very deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of Lifeleſneſs, which lying in the ſealed or guarded Sepulchre, he was accounted as one dead. Riſing out of the Water, holds forth to us a lively Similitude of that Conqueſt which this dead Man got over Death. In like manner, ſaith he, 'tis therefore meet that we being baptized into his Death, and buried with him, ſhould riſe alſo with him, and to go on in a new Life. Thus far <hi>Tilenus.</hi>

               <p>How doth God complain by the Prophet againſt his People of Old, for preſuming to change his Laws, in <hi>Deut.</hi> 12.13? God gave particular Command to make an Altar of Gold to offer In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe, <hi>Exod.</hi> 40.5. And he commanded, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.24, 25. that his Altars ſhould be made of Earth or rough Stone. But in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65.3. he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves their horrid Tranſgreſſion and Diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, in acting contrary to his expreſs Inſtitution: <hi>A People</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>that provoke me to Anger con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually to my Face, that ſacrificeth in Gardens, and burn Incenſe upon Altars of Brick.</hi> You may think that was no great Error, inſtead of Gold or Stone, to make Altars of Brick: But what ſaith God, They for this, <hi>&amp;c. provoke me continually to my Face.</hi> O tremble ye who adventure to tranſgreſs God's Precept in as bad or worſe a manner! who commanded you to baptize or dip Believers in <hi>the Name of the Father,</hi> &amp;c. and you rantize or ſprinkle <hi>Infants:</hi> Alas you know not how you hereby provoke God; although he is yet ſilent, and doth not manifeſt his Diſpleaſure, yet know he is a jealous God, and hath the like Zeal for his Goſpel-Inſtitutions as ever he had of thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, and may manifeſt it too in his own time. But to proceed and call in further Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes againſt your Practice.</p>

<q>If Baptiſm adminiſtred by pouring Water on the Face (repreſents the whole Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon) doth anſwer the Uſe and End of Baptiſm, as well as when adminiſtred by Dipping or Plunging; then Dipping is not eſſentially and abſolutely neceſſary in the Act of baptizing: But the one anſwers the Uſe and End of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm as well as the other; therefore the one cannot be more neceſſary than the other.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>What is the Uſe and End of Baptiſm but to repreſent to our Minds the Effuſion of Chriſt's Blood, for to take away the Guilt of Sin; and the pouring forth of the Holy Spirit, for the purging away the Filth of it? Now (ſay you) the ſprinkling of the Blood of Chriſt, and the pouring forth of the Holy Spirit upon the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant, are more fully and plainly repreſented by Baptiſm, ad adminiſtred by Sprinkling, than by Dipping.</q>

                  <q>If, ſay you, the inward and ſpiritual Grace ſignified by Baptiſm, be more lively repreſented by Sprinkling than by Dipping; then ſurely Sprinkling is not only as lawful, but more expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient than Dipping: but the inward and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Grace ſignified by Baptiſm, to wit, the cleanſing of the Soul by the Grace and Spirit of Chriſt, is more lively repreſented by Sprinkling than by Dipping: therefore more expedient.

the Teſtimony of the Scripture, and almoſt all learned Men, both <hi>ancient Fathers</hi> and <hi>modern Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines,</hi> fully ſhews the contrary.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I thought the Sacrament of the Lord's Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per had been inſtituted by Chriſt, to ſignify the Effuſion or pouring forth his precious Blood, and not Baptiſm: Will you confound the Uſe and End of one Sacrament with the other, to maintain your own Innovation and Abuſe of Chriſt's Holy Baptiſm?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Might not the Jews, who inſtead of making <hi>Altars of Gold of Stone,</hi> made them <hi>Altars of Brick,</hi> ſay, that Altars of Brick might ſerve as well to anſwer the <hi>

What need we have Wine?</hi> If we uſe Mum, or ſome other red Liqour, inſtead of the Fruit of the Grape, it will anſwer the Uſe and End of that Sacrament, as well as Wine. O! whither would this lead us?</p>
               <p n="4">4. We utterly deny that Baptiſm was ordained or inſtituted by Chriſt to ſignify either the pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth of his Blood, or the pouring forth of the Holy Spirit; and muſt tell you, that you af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm what you pleaſe, without any Proof from God's Word. But by the way let the Reader obſerve how you go from <hi>Sprinkling</hi> to plead for <hi>pouring Water</hi> on the Face of Infants: I queſtion whether you ever do ſo or not? but if you ſhould, that would be no more Chriſt's Baptiſm than Sprinkling.</p>
               <p>You are not to deviſe <hi>new Signs</hi> or <hi>Symbols</hi> of ſpiritual Myſteries, of which God ſpeaks nothing in his Word, nor ever inſtituted to ſuch Ends.
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:44276:97"/>
I affirm he has appointed no Rite or Ordinance in the Goſpel to repreſent the <hi>Sprinkling or pouring forth of the Holy Spirit.</hi> The Papiſts have (you know) ſeven Sacraments, and they tell us of the Uſe and End of them, and how wonderful ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant they are; and yet all their Uſe and Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diency of them were the Contrivances of their own wicked Hearts. And I muſt tell you that they prove what they do and ſay of thoſe Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as well as you do what you ſpeak of Pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or Sprinkling. Take what <hi>Tho. Aquinas</hi> moſt excellently hath ſaid on this Account.<note place="margin">Aquinas.</note> 
                  <hi>It belongs to the Signifier</hi> (ſays he) <hi>to determine what Sign is to be uſed for the Signification: but God it is, who by things ſenſible, ſignifies ſpiritual things in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> Chriſt hath ordained Baptiſm to be a Sign, Symbol or lively Repreſentation of <hi>his own Death, Burial and Reſurrection,</hi> as I have proved and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by a Cloud of Witneſſes. Will God en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure or ſuffer men (think you) to invent out of their own Brains new Signs and Symbols of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Goſpel-Myſteries, and then father them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and call them his Ordinances? Nay, more, be ſo bold as to ſay, theſe are more uſeful, and anſwer better the End of God, than thoſe which he himſelf inſtituted? For thus you ſpeak of Sprinkling, <hi>viz. 'tis not only lawful, but more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient than Dipping,</hi> p. 55. And hereby you ſeem to teach God Wiſdom, or to magnify yours above his. <hi>Be aſtoniſhed, O Heavens and be thou horribly amazed, O Earth!</hi> Was ever any Man thus bold before? Firſt you contrive a new Rite, and new Significations of it, which God never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to repreſent ſuch things, and then ſay, 'tis more expedient than Chriſt's Ordinance of Dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, which was inſtituted by him for other Ends and Significations; whereas the whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of all learned Men, and Chriſtians, witneſs to, and teſtify the contrary.</p>

               <p>Saith he,
<q>Baptiſm, which now ſaves us by Water, (ſpeaking of the Text in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.20.) that is, by the aſſiſtance of Water, and is An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titypical of the Ark of <hi>Noah,</hi> does not ſignify the laying down the Filth of the Fleſh, but the Covenant of a good Conſcience towards God, while we are plunged in the Water, which is to teſtify our Belief of the Reſurrection of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt; ſo that there is a manifeſt <hi>Antitheſis</hi> between theſe words, <hi>by Water,</hi> and <hi>by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection.</hi> Nor is (ſaith he) the Elegancy of it diſpleaſing. As if he ſhould ſay, the <hi>Ark of Noah,</hi> not the Flood, was a Type of Baptiſm, and Baptiſm was an Antitype of the Ark; not as if Baptiſm is a waſhing away of the Filth of the Fleſh by Water, wherein it anſwers not at all to the Ark; but as it is the Covenant of a good Conſcience towards God by the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Chriſt, in the belief of which Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection we are ſaved, as they were ſaved by the <hi>Ark of Noah:</hi> for the Ark and Baptiſm were both a Type and Figure of the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. So that the proper End [mark] of Baptiſm ought not to be underſtood as if it were a Sign of the waſhing away of Sin, (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be thus often-times taken metony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mically in the New-Teſtament) and by the Fathers, but a particular Signal of the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection by Faith, in the Reſurrection of Chriſt, of which Baptiſm is a lively and emphatical Figure; as alſo was the Ark, out of which <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi> returned, as from the Sepulcher to a new Life; and therefore not unaptly called by <hi>Philo,</hi> the Captain of the New Creation.

of <hi>Iſrael</hi> are ſaid to have been Baptized, is not waſhed, [mark] but buried, for they were all Types of the ſame thing, as Baptiſm, <hi>viz.</hi> not the waſhing away of Sin, but of the Death and Reſurrection of Chriſt, and our own: to which the Apoſtles, the Fathers, the Scholaſticks, [mark] and all Interpreters agree.

               <p>Therefore, Sir, that Baptiſm is any thing elſe than dipping, plunging, or waſhing which is done by dipping, we do utterly deny: For as the cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off a little bit of the Foreskin of the Fleſh, or not the twentieth part round, is not Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion; ſo ſprinkling a little Water on the Face, is not Baptiſm.</p>

But may be you will ſay, in Circumciſion they were to draw Blood; ſo ſay I, they might in cutting the Nails of their Childrens Fingers; nay, and they might better plead, that the things ſignified in Circumciſion, might be as well anſwered in that new Device, (the Nails be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſort of Excrement, they might ſay ſignified the taking away the Filth of Sin, or Corruption of Nature) better than the great Myſteries ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by Baptiſm or Dipping, can be repreſented by Sprinkling or Pouring.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, they might poſſibly plead the ſame Pretences you do, <hi>viz. the cutting off the Foreskin of the Fleſh,</hi> put the Infants to great Pain; nay, may be they might fancy it would coſt them their Lives; nay, call it Murder, and therefore let pairing off their Nails ſerve; as you, it ſeems, fear Dipping would endanger the Lives of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, and therefore make Sprinkling to ſerve in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead thereof. But to proceed:</p>
               <p n="2">2. I am in a-maze to ſee theſe Men ſpeak ſo fully and clearly to this glorious Truth, (<hi>i. e.</hi> that the great thing Chriſt ordained Baptiſm to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, is his <hi>Death, Burial and Reſurrection,</hi> together with the baptized Perſon's <hi>Death to Sin, and his riſing again to walk in newneſs of Life</hi>;) that both thoſe ſhameful Abuſes in your Church, and among other Churches alſo, are not rectified, <hi>viz.</hi>

<pb n="192" facs="tcp:44276:101"/>
proper Subjects of Baptiſm, ſith nothing of a Death to Sin, nor riſing again to walk in newneſs of Life, can appear in them. For as the Learned obſerve, Baptiſm is a Symbol of preſent, not of future Regeneration; 'tis an outward Sign of that inward Death unto Sin, which the Party baptized paſſed under then, or ought to have done, when (or before) he is baptized. They then profeſſed themſelves to be dead to Sin, <hi>i. e.</hi> even when they were buried with Chriſt in their Baptiſm: for the Argument of the Apoſtle lies in that reſpect, <hi>How ſhall we that are dead to Sin, live any longer therein?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 6.3, 4</note> 
                  <hi>knowing that ſo many of us who have been bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized into Chriſt, were baptized into his Death,</hi> both in Sign and Signification: And therefore, as Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> ſays, <hi>riſing out of that watry Grave a new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born Creature,</hi> denotes not only what they ſhould be hereafter, but what they were actually at that time. So that as this Text, and Arguments drawn therefrom, utterly condemn Sprinkling, as not being Chriſt's Baptiſm; ſo it excludes Infants from being the Subjects thereof, becauſe in them appears no ſuch Death to Sin, nor can they be ſaid to come out of that watry Grave as new-born Creatures.</p>

he, Sacramentally, <hi>i. e. Analogically,</hi> in reſpect of the near reſemblance between Baptiſm, and a Death and Reſurrection.

<q>But you ſay, Baptiſm may ſignify the Death of Chriſt, and be ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred, as lively to repreſent the Death of our Saviour, without the expoſing thoſe who are baptized to the <hi>danger of Death</hi>; and may ſignify Chriſt's Burial too <hi>without ſending the Perſon baptized</hi> to his Grave: <hi>even in Sprinkling,</hi> there is a plain Repreſentation of Chriſt's Death; for the pouring forth of the Water not unfitly repreſents the pouring forth the Earth upon the dead Body.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> If you did pour Water upon the Child indeed until it was quite buried, or <hi>covered all over in Water,</hi> you had ſaid ſomething; tho that is not the way of baptizing neither, but dipping, or plunging; yet that would, I muſt confeſs, repreſent a Burial: But is the dead Body buried ſo ſoon as a handful of Earth is poured upon him? if you ſhould ſay it, no body would believe you, the Body muſt be covered under the Earth before it can be ſaid to be buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſo muſt the Perſon baptized be covered under the Water, or 'tis not baptized; for as otherwiſe there is no actual Burial in the firſt, ſo there is no Repreſentation of a Burial in the ſecond.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>But, ſay you, if you will cloſely follow the Metaphor of a Burial in all Particulars; then as the Perſon buried is altogether paſſive, and laid in the Grave only by others, in like manner the Party baptized, ſay you, ought to

You know Metaphors do not go (as we uſe to ſay) on all four, nor muſt they be ſtrained further than the deſign and purport of the holy Spirit; but you by ſprinkling deſtroy and utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make void that <hi>ſacred Alluſion</hi> of the Holy Ghoſt, which is not to be born with: Baptiſm is no Repreſentation of a Burial at all, if Sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling be it. And if you have heard that ſome have been kept ſo long under the VVater till (as you ſay) almoſt choaked, or buried alive; I ſuppoſe 'tis not the firſt Untruth you have heard.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Pag.</hi> 58, and 59. about Chriſt's not being baptized till <hi>thirty Years of Age,</hi> you ſay,
<q>Chriſt was circumciſed at eight days old; and altho he was not baptized in his <hi>Infancy,</hi> yet he was baptized in the <hi>Infancy of Baptiſm:</hi> alſo you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate, that ſome expound the words for <hi>his coming up out of the Water,</hi> that the Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the River <hi>Jordan</hi> was beneath the place where <hi>John</hi> was teaching.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Circumciſion was then in force, now 'tis gone, therefore in that Chriſt could not be an Example for us, but in Baptiſm (which is
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:44276:106"/>
an Ordinance of the New Teſtament) he is our <hi>Example</hi> and <hi>Pattern,</hi> as his Precept is our Rule, in that we ſhould follow his Steps.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And let me tell you, if it was in <hi>the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy of Baptiſm,</hi> (you mean the beginning of the Practice of it) you hereby contradict what you have ſaid about thoſe <hi>Jewiſh Baptiſms,</hi> which you ſay were long in uſe before our Saviour's time, <hi>and from hence he ſpoke ſo little of Infant-Baptiſm</hi>; if it were ſo, how was this in the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy of Baptiſm?</hi>

               <p n="4">4. As to what you ſay, that <hi>John</hi> baptized in <hi>Aenon, becauſe there was much Water</hi>; that the word ſignifies <hi>many Waters,</hi> I have anſwered that already, but take one word or two more here. True, the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſignifies many Waters, but not little Rivolets, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the tumultuouſneſs and raging of the Seas, which fully ſignifies the abundance and conflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Waters, contrary to what you affirm. See <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.2. where you have the ſame origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal words, ſo <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.6.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And laſtly, as to your Arguments againſt <hi>re-baptizing,</hi> I paſs them over, you might have ſaved your ſelf that Pains, for we (as I told you before) are as much againſt <hi>re-baptizing</hi> as you
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:44276:107"/>
can be, or for any to renounce their true Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm; your Arguments therefore in that are good. And now from the whole take two Arguments.</p>

                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. If Baptiſm was ordained to repreſent the <hi>Death, Burial and Reſurrection of Chriſt</hi> in a lively Figure; then Sprinkling cannot be Chriſt's true Baptiſm: But Baptiſm was ordained to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent <hi>the Death, Burial and Reſurrection of Chriſt</hi> in a lively Figure; therefore Sprinkling cannot be Chriſt's true Baptiſm.</p>
               <p>This Argument we have proved to be true in every part of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. If Baptiſm was appointed to hold forth or repreſent in a lively Figure the Perſon's Death to Sin, who is baptized, or his preſent Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, not future, and his riſing again to walk in Newneſs of Life; then Infants cannot be the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects thereof.

<q>Others, ſays he (more properly) think the Apoſtle uſes this term in regard of the great <hi>Analogy Betwixt Baptiſm</hi> (as it was uſed) the Perſons going down into the Waters, and being <hi>dipped</hi> in them; and the <hi>Iſraelites going down into the Sea,</hi> the great Receptable of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, though the Water at that time was gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on Heaps on either ſide of them; yet they ſeemed buried in the Water, as Perſons ſeemed
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:44276:107"/>
buried in the Water were in that Age, when they were baptized.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond <hi>typical Baptiſm</hi> was that of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi>'s Ark: See Sir <hi>Norton Knatchbul,</hi> whom I quoted before, ſaith he,
<q>
                     <hi>Noah</hi>'s Ark and Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm were both a Type and Figure of the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, not a Sign of the waſhing away of Sin, though ſo taken <hi>metonymically,</hi> but a particular Signal of the Reſurrection of Chriſt; of this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, ſaith he, is Baptiſm a lively and emphatical Figure, as alſo was the Ark of <hi>Noah,</hi> out of which he returned as from a Sepulchre.</q>
From hence I infer this Argument following.</p>

                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 3. If thoſe <hi>typical Baptiſms</hi> ſpoken of in the Scriptures, ſignified Immerſion, or an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelming, or a Burial; then is Sprinkling no true Baptiſm: But thoſe typical Baptiſms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> did ſignify Immerſion, or an Overwhelming, or a Burial; therefore Sprinkling is no true Baptiſm.<note place="margin">Metaphori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſms ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy Dipping or Plung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Mat. 3.11.</hi>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is a way to bring poor Souls into Covenant, that God ſpeaks nothing of in his Word.

               <p>
                  <hi>Query</hi> 1. Whether the being the male Children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> as ſuch, gave them a right to Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, or not rather the mere poſitive Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God to <hi>Abraham?</hi>

                  <hi>Query</hi> 2. Whether Circumciſion could be ſaid to be a Seal of any Man's Faith, ſave <hi>Abraham</hi>'s only, ſeeing it is only called the Seal of the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of his Faith, and alſo of that Faith which he had, being yet uncircumciſed?</p>
