            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Therefore men should set a due estimate
upon this commodity, and expend it
thriftily and wisely: to which purpose the
ancient <hi>Sages</hi> of the world have ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
devised a way to divide even the
Natural day (which is one of the least
measures of time) into hours, and those
into quarters and minutes, and into lesser
Fractions then they; that by this <hi>Horo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry,</hi>
they might mete out and proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
business to the time, and time to the
business in hand. The name of <hi>Horae,</hi>
Hours, came from <hi>Horus Apollo,</hi> an Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptian
Sage, who first divided the day
into those portions we call hours, as <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crobius
Saturnal. l. 1. cap.</hi> 21. informs us.</p>
            <p>In Aegypt there was a Beast of a very
strange kinde, called <hi>Cynocephalus,</hi> kept
in the Temple of <hi>Serapis,</hi> which in the
time of the two Aequinoxes, did make
water twelve times in a day, and so often
in the night, and that regularly, at even
spaces of time; from the observation
whereof they divided the natural day in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
twenty four hours; and that Beast was
their Clock and Dyal, both to divide the
day, and reckon the hours by. This gave
a hint (belike) to the <hi>Clepsydrae,</hi> or water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glasses
(invented by <hi>Ctesibius</hi> of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria</hi>)
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:51884:10"/>
which distingu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>shed the hours by the
fall or dropping of water, as <hi>Clepsammidia</hi>
or Sand-glasses did by the running of
sand: <hi>Miro modo in terris aqua peragit,
quod Solis flammeus vigor desuper modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus
excutrit.</hi> Cassiod. de Divin. Lection.
c. 30. And to shew they owed the inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to this creature, they used to set one
carved on the top of these Water glasses,
as may be seen in <hi>Kirker</hi> in <hi>Mechanica Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptiaca.</hi>
The Heavens are the grand u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversal
clock of the world, from whose
incessant and regular motion, all times
here below are distinguished and measu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
            <p>And because time is in continual flux
or motion, and passes away with silent
feet, insensibly and invisibly, therefore it
was necessary to invent a way how to
make the motion of time (according to
the several divisions thereof) visible to
the eye, or audible to the ear, that it
should not steal away without our notice,
but that we might tell and count its steps
and stealth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anaximenes</hi> the Philosopher was the
first that took an account of time by
shaddows projected on the ground, and
which changed and moved according to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:51884:11"/>
the motion of the Sun, from which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
he devised Sun-dyals called
<hi>Scioterica.</hi> Though <hi>Vitruvius</hi> ascribes
the Invention to <hi>Berosus</hi> the Chaldean,
who framed <hi>Vasa Horoscopa,</hi> and <hi>Epicyclia
ex cavavata cum stylo</hi> (as he terms them)
certain hollow Dyals (like dishes) with
Stiles or <hi>Gnomons</hi> erected in the middle.
At <hi>Rome</hi> they counted the day (for a long
time) by the shaddow of a brazen Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisk
or Pillar: when the shaddow of the
pillar did fall in such a place, they did
account it Noon or Mid-day, and then a
Cryer was appointed to cry it about the
Town; So likewise at Evening, when the
shaddow fell in such a place, the Cryer
proclaimed <hi>horam supremam,</hi> the last
hour of day: other distinctions they had
none as yet.</p>
            <p>The Nasican <hi>Scipio</hi> was the first that
brought the use of Water-glasses a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
them, and distinguished the hours
of day and night; until his time, <hi>Populo
Romano indiscreta lux fuit,</hi> saith <hi>Pliny,</hi> the
Roman people had no division of hours;
as the Turks (at this day) have no distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of their ways by miles, nor of their
days by hours, as <hi>Busbequias</hi> relates <hi>Ep.</hi>

            <p>Among the Persians every ones bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
was his Dyal: so it was in <hi>Ammianus
Marcellinus</hi> his time: But these ways of
<hi>Horometry</hi> were rude and imperfect. By
Water-glasses the account was not regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar:
for from the attenuation and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>densation
of the water, the hours were
shorter or longer, according to the heat
or coldness of the weather. Then for the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:51884:12"/>
Sun-dyals they did serve but at some
times, only by day time, and then not
alwaies neither, but when the Sun shined.
To remedy these defects, some wits did
cast about how to distinguish the hours of
the night as well as of the day; and of
cloudy days as well as of serene and
clear. Hereupon some Engines and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances
have been composed by <hi>Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chilique</hi>
art, or the artifice of Wheels;
which by the motion of several Wheels,
and Springs, and Weights, and counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poizes
should give an account of the
time, without Sun or Stars; and these
were called <hi>Horologes.</hi>

            <p>Of these Horologes, some are <hi>mute,</hi>
and some <hi>vocal: Vocal</hi> I call those which
by the sound of a Bell striking at just in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals
and periods of time, do proclaim
the hour of the day or night, yea, even
half hours and minutes; by the benefit
whereof, even blinde men that can see
neither Sun nor shaddow, and those that
lie in their beds, may know how the time
goes, and how long they have bin there,
although they slept all the while; and are
properly called Clocks, from the French
word <hi>Cloche,</hi> a Bell.</p>
            <l>It rota nexa rot is, tinnulaque aere sonant.</l>
            <p>
               <hi>Mute</hi> Horologes are such as perform a
silent motion, and do not speak the time
of the day, but point at it with an Index,
such as are Sun-dyals and Watches; the
last of which go by springs and wheels,
as the others by weights and wheels: yet
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:51884:13"/>
some of these are vocal too, and carry
Bells and Alarums, to signifie unto us the
stealth of time. Many carry Watches
about them that do little heed the fabrick
and contrivance, or the wit and skill of
the workmanship; as there be many that
dwell in this habitable world, that do lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
consider or regard the <hi>wheel-work</hi> of
this great Machin, and the fabrick of the
house they dwell in. A King of <hi>China</hi>
upon his first seeing of a Watch, thought
it a living creature, because it moved so
regularly of it self, and thought it dead
when it was run out, and its pulses did
not beat.</p>
            <p>The wit of man hath been luxuriant
and wanton in the Inventions of late
years; some have made Watches so
small and light, that Ladies hang them at
their ears like pendants and jewels; the
smalness and variety of the tools that are
used about these small Engines, seem to
me no less admirable then the Engines
themselves; and there is more Art and
Dexterity in placing so many Wheels
and Axles in so small a compass (for some
French Watches do not exceed the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass
of a farthing) then in making Clocks
and greater Machines.</p>

               </gap>, The great Engineer
of the world, that tacked this rare <hi>Systeme</hi>
of heaven and earth together, tackt the
Center to the Sphears, and made the
whole Frame to move in a wonderful
order from its first creation to this day.
The earth is a rare piece of his Staticks,
being hanged upon nothing, as <hi>Job</hi> saith,
<hi>Job</hi> 26. 7. it hangs in the very Center and
middle of the world, like a Ball in the
Ayr, but fixt and immovable, being
evenly ballanced and counterpoized
with its own weight:<note place="margin">Ov. Met. l. 1.</note>

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:51884:21"/>
suis.</hi> So those pendulous Mountains (the
Clouds) whose ballancings that great
Philosopher <hi>Job</hi> admired, <hi>Job</hi> 37. 16.
and those fiery Mountains (the Comets)
are Gods <hi>Isorropica,</hi> and some admirable
parcels and pieces of his Mathematiques.
But the whole Machin of the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
taken in the entire frame and fabrick
of it, is a greater wonder then all other
wonders in the world,<note place="margin">De Civit. l. 11.</note> as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Augustine</hi>
gives his judgement. This is a kinde of
an <hi>Automaton</hi> or Engine that moves of it
self, much like a great Clock with wheels
and poyzes, and counterpoyzes, that is
alwaies in motion, though no body
moves it.</p>
            <p>For I cannot believe that the Angels
(those glorious creatures) are tyed to the
heavenly bodies (like dogs in a wheel) to
give them motion, but that that great
Engineer which made them, gave them
a seeing or motion at first, that continues
to this day, and will continue so long as
the Sun and Moon endureth.</p>
            <p>As the great world is an <hi>Automaton,</hi> so
is the little world (man) a sort of a self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving
Engine, that performs its several
motions by certain Springs, and Wheels,
and Chords that are acted by one secret
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:51884:22"/>
principle of all motions, to wit, the heart
and spirits therein contained, and which
are from thence dispersed through the
whole frame of the work.</p>
            <l>Mens agitat molem, &amp; parvo se corpore
miscet.</l>
            <p>Now it is observed, that the wit of man
by a diligent and attentive perusal of the
world and himself, hath framed sundry
useful Machins and artificial motions,
after those patterns, after the frame and
model of those two primary <hi>Automata</hi>
that God himself made. A Mill was
first made after the pattern of a man's
mouth,<note place="margin">

                  </gap>.</note> as <hi>Seneca</hi> tells us in his ninth E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle;
An Organ pipe had its pattern
from mans weazand, which is inspired
with the Lungs, and many other Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
have been hinted unto us from the
Organs of mans body, and the actions
performed by them.</p>
            <p>For Engineers, such as were expert in
the practical part of the Mathematiques,
these were the most renowned in ancient
times. <hi>Archimedes</hi> of Syracuse, <hi>Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas</hi>
of Tarentum, <hi>Severinus Boetius</hi> of
<hi>Rome, Proclus, Heron,</hi> and <hi>Ctesibius,</hi> both

of <hi>Norimberg, Simon Stevinus</hi> of

Countryman, whom we mentioned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<hi>Athanasius Kircher</hi> by birth a Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
but living (of late) in <hi>Rome,</hi> and
<hi>Marinus Marsennus,</hi> a Frier of <hi>Paris.</hi> These
were <hi>Magi</hi> and <hi>Thaumaturgi Mathematici</hi>
wonder-workers, or such as performed
marvellous feats by their great skill in
Mathematical Sciences.</p>
            <p>Cassiodorus <hi>a grave learned man, and
Secretary to</hi> Theodorick <hi>King of the
Goths, gives this character of the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named</hi>
Boetius <hi>in a certain Letter written
unto him:</hi> You know (<hi>saith he</hi>) the secrets
of Nature, and can work wonders by your

<hi>Diomedes</hi> cast in brass, sounds his Trumpet
louder; Here the brazen serpent hisses, and
there artificial Birds (that had no voice)
sing melodiously; yet these are but trivial
things to relate of him, who can imitate the
motions of the heavens here on earth.</p>

performed by Ayr, or by Water, and so
all Engins, at least such as move of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
are (or may be) divided in <hi>spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talia

the feat full well (it seems) for he
professeth the skill to make the like with

to fly from <hi>Norimberg</hi> to meet the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
on his way thither;<note place="margin">Exercit. contra Cardan. 326.</note> and when it
met him, it hovered over his head with
a Tonick motion, and then returned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
with him the same way that it came.
The Iron Fly was the like device, made
by the same <hi>Regiomontanus,</hi> which
springing from under his hand, would
fly round about the room with a hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
noise, and then return back under
his hand again.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Simon Stevinius</hi> a Dutchman, made a
chariot to go with sails, which was as
swift almost as the wind that drove it;
for it would carry eight or nine persons
from <hi>Scheveling</hi> in Holland to <hi>Putten</hi> in
two hours, which was the space of forty
miles and upwards.</p>
               <p>Monsieur <hi>Peyresc</hi> a learned Antiquary
of <hi>France,</hi> made a journey to see it, and

also to utter some words articulately:
For their motion, it must be ascribed to
some wheels and springs within, like the

<hi>Vulcan</hi>'s Tripodes: But for their voice
or speech, it must be ascribed unto some

               <p>The Sybils books were written in the

do write in the leaves of the Plane tree,
which are as broad as any sheet of paper,

and four times as long, saith <hi>Jos. Acosta
l. 4. cap.</hi> 21. So in <hi>Malabar,</hi> and other

of books the Bible; because books were
usually made of this kinde of reed or
sedge; and the manner was thus; they
divided these leaves into thin flakes called

themselves, then laying them on a
smooth table, and moistning them with
the water of <hi>Nilus</hi> (which is of a gluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous

and make the Town of <hi>Haerlem</hi> the birth
place of this Noble Art: You may see
what esteem men do make of it, when
they do so zealously strive and contend
for the original Invention of it. his
<hi>Junius</hi> tells us (in his History of the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands)
that one <hi>Laurence John,</hi> a
Burger of good Note and Quality of
<hi>Haerlem,</hi> was the first Inventer of it, and
saith that he made Letters first of the
barks of Trees, which being set and
ranked in order, and clapt with their
heels upward upon paper, he made the
first essay and experiment of this Art:
At first he made but a line or two, then
whole pages, and then books, but printed
on one side only. Which rudiments of
the Art <hi>Junius</hi> saw in that Town.</p>
            <p>After this the said <hi>Lawrence</hi> made
Types or characters of Tin, and brought

one <hi>John Faustus (infaustus</hi> to him)
whom he had employed for a Composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
and who had now learn'd the myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
stole away by night all the Letters

that the first Printing was upon wooden
Tables, the Letters being cut or carved
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:51884:42"/>
in them, and he saith, that he had seen
<hi>Horologium Beatae Mariae</hi> (to wit) our La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies

such a manner, in his answer against <hi>Shci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oppus,</hi>

Yet let not the Germans or any
others be too proud of this Invention, for
the <hi>Chinois</hi> had such an art long before
the <hi>Europeans</hi> saw or heard any thing of
it, as it is affirmed by <hi>Parus Maffeus,</hi> and
sundry others of his fellow-Jesuites that
have travelled that Country. One <hi>Nicol.
Trigault</hi> that had been of late years in
that Country affirms, that that Nation
had this art above 500 years since. But
their Printing and ours do very much
differ from one another, for they do not
print by composing of Letters, but as we
use for Maps and such pieces, they make
for every leaf a board or table with cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
on both sides, which is more la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious,
and less neat then the European
way, as <hi>Gonsalvo Mendoza</hi> a Spanish Frier
and others do affirm of it. Now if our
Printing surpass for neatness and expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
and is so far different from that of
the <hi>Chinois</hi> as is before alledged, it is a
signe that the Germans did not borrow
from them this art; so that the praise and
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:51884:43"/>
commendation of this Invention remains
to them whole and entire without dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution.</p>
            <p>Mrs. <hi>Joan Elizabeth Weston,</hi> one of the
Muses of <hi>England,</hi> hath composed a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine
Poem (among sundry others of her
compositions) in the praise of this art,
which is indeed the preserver of all other
arts.</p>
            <p>AS Printing it self is praise worthy,
so some Print-houses deserve here
to be remembred, especially that of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stopher
Plantin</hi> at <hi>Antwerp,</hi> which a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller
doth not stick to call <hi>Octavum orbis

world. He describes it thus. Over the

Freeze-stone, and of <hi>Moret</hi> his Son in

            <p>

            <p>When this <hi>Apelles</hi> came to <hi>Rhodes,</hi>
where <hi>Protogenes</hi> (another famous Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter)
lived, he went to his house, and not
finding him within, he drew with a pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
a streight line, very small and slender,
and left it as a challenge, and went his
way. <hi>Protogenes</hi> coming home and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this line, did guess that <hi>Apelles</hi> had
been there, and thereupon drew another
line through the very midst of that line
of <hi>Apelles</hi> with a different colour, which
was (in effect) an answer to the chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge;
<hi>Apelles</hi> returning again to <hi>Proto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes</hi>
his shop, and finding a line most
artificially drawn through the midst of
his, took the pencil and drew a third
line in a different colour, from the two
former, <hi>nullum relinquens amplius sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilitati
locum</hi> (saith my Author) leaving
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:51884:46"/>
no room for further art or subtilty, and
so was <hi>Victor</hi> in this invention.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>However,</hi> Protogenes <hi>was esteemed

            <p>There is a pretty story in the same
<hi>Pliny</hi> to this purpose, touching <hi>Zeuxes</hi>
and <hi>Parrhasius,</hi> two famous Artizans
and Masters of the Pencil in their times:
for <hi>Quintilian</hi> calls this <hi>Parrhasius</hi> the
<hi>Legislator</hi> among the Painters, that is, one
that gave Law to all others in this Art,
<hi>l. C. 12. C. 10. Zeuxes</hi> for his Master<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece
hung forth a Table wherein he had
drawn a Boy carrying Grapes in his
hand, which were so lively done, that
the Birds flew to the Table to peck at the
Grapes: But <hi>Parrhasius</hi> painted a Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
upon a Tablet so artificially, that
<hi>Zeuxes</hi> thinking it had been a Curtain
indeed, stretcht his hand to draw the
Curtain aside, that he might see the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
which he thought to be behinde it;
at which error he was so abashed, that he
yielded the best to <hi>Parrhasius,</hi> adding
this ingenuous confession, That <hi>Zeuxes</hi>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:51884:47"/>
his piece had deceived but silly Birds,
but that of <hi>Parrhasius</hi> deceived an <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The same <hi>Zeuxes</hi> painted an Old
Woman so lively and so deformed, that
he died with extream laughter at the
spectacle and his own ridiculous fancy
and conceit therein, as <hi>Quercetan</hi> reports
in his <hi>Diaetat. Polyhist.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pliny</hi> makes mention of some Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
painters; and of one <hi>Lala</hi> a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
of <hi>Cyzicum,</hi> that drew her own pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
by a Glass: and <hi>Mountaigue</hi> in his
Essaies speaks of a picture which he had
seen at <hi>Barleduc</hi> that <hi>Ren</hi> King of <hi>Sicily</hi>
had made of himself and presented to
the French King <hi>Francis</hi> the Second.</p>
            <p>It is a pretty Art, that in a pleated
paper, and table furrowed or indented,
men make one picture to represent seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
faces; as one I have seen, that look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from one place or standing, represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth; from another,
Queen <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> and from a third
place, King <hi>James.</hi> Another I read
of, that being viewed from one place,
did shew the head of a Spaniard, and
from another the head of an Ass. This
was the conceit of a Frenchmen (I
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:51884:47"/>
believe) who can neither speak well
nor think well of a Spaniard.</p>
            <p>One of the late <hi>Chancellours</hi> of <hi>France</hi>
had in his cabinet a picture w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> presented
to the common beholder a multitude of
little faces, which were the famous An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors
of that noble man; but if one
did look on the said picture through a
<hi>Perspective,</hi> there appeared onely the
single pourtraicture of the <hi>Chancellour</hi>
himself: the Painter thereby intimating,
that in him alone were contracted all the
vertues of his Progenitors. So the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious
translator of <hi>Pastor Fido</hi> in his
Epistle Dedicatory relates.<note place="margin">Mr. Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shaw.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Painting in Oyle is a modern Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which was wanting to the full com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement
and perfection of this Art;
for hereby Colours are kept fresh and
lively from fading, and pictures are
made to bear against the injuries of time,
air, and age; when their <hi>Prototypes</hi> and
originals cannot, notwithstanding all the
<hi>Fucusses</hi> and <hi>decorations</hi> and Adulteries
of Art among our Women-painters,
who can never repair the decayes of
nature with all their boxes and shops
of <hi>Minerals.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:51884:48"/>The Art of Sculpture or Engraving
in brass (which the French call <hi>de taille
Douce</hi>) is near of kin to this art, and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
to be preferred before it; for that
when a picture in this kinde is finished
upon a table of Brass or Copper, or the
like mettal, a thousand Copies may be
taken of it (by the help of a Rolling-Press)
in a few hours space, as in Printing,
when one page of a leaf is set and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
that one form will serve to make
a thousand more by it, and that in a trice,
whereas a picture in colours is not so soon
copied out.</p>
            <p>But the highest piece of perfection in
this art (in my judgement) are those per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective
pieces which do represent Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
wherein the vulgar eye discerns no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
upon the Tablet but arched lines
and steps, degrees, or ascents; but with
a Perspective glass you may see (as it
were) the inside of a Temple at ful length
with the arched roofs above, &amp; windows
on each side: Some Statues cast in brass
do shew much wit and art. The brazen
Cow of <hi>Myron</hi> is made famous by the
Epigram of <hi>Ausonius</hi> translated out of
Greek, which was so lively done, that
Bulls passing by thought to cover her; as
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:51884:48"/>
the Poet (if he do not over-reach) informs
us.</p>
            <l>Bucula sum, coelo genitoris facta <hi>Myro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis</hi>

            <p>But the chiefest of this art of Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dery
or Imagery was <hi>Lysippus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Plin. l. 35. cap. 8.</note> who did
cast one Image of brass so rare and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite,
that Artificers called it the <hi>Canon,</hi>
that is, the rule or standard from whence
all Artists must fetch their Draughts,
Symmetries, and Proportions, as from
the pattern and most absolute Master<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece.</p>
            <p>Of late times the Italians and Germans
do surpass in these Arts, <hi>Michael Angelo

            <p>So one of his countrymen writes of him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Albertus Durerus</hi> of <hi>Norimberg</hi> was not
inferiour to <hi>Apelles,</hi> as <hi>Wimphelingius</hi>
tells us; <hi>Van Dijk</hi> a Dutchman was very
famous in <hi>London,</hi> and attained to very
great wealth by his art; <hi>Paulus Rubeus</hi>
of <hi>Antwerp</hi> is <hi>vivum Europae miraculum,</hi>
(if he be yet alive) as an ingenious Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller
styles him, whose Table of the

Florins; <hi>Tabulae oppidorum opidus
emptae;</hi> so <hi>Pliny</hi> of the Curiosities of his
time.</p>
            <p>The Art of Painting in Glass, which
they call <hi>Annealing,</hi> is very ingenious:
when they have layed the colours upon
the Glass, they put the Glass into some
hot Furnace for fifteen or twenty days to
imbibe the colours: This art was known
unto the Ancients, as <hi>Bullinger</hi> is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded,
and cites a Distich of <hi>Martial</hi>
for it;</p>
            <l>Non sumus audacis plebeia <hi>Toreumata</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:51884:49"/>
But the Poet means no such matter there,
but he speaks of certain cups made of
Christal, or some subtiler and finer sort
of Glass which cannot brook hot water,
as common glasses can, but crack pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
when it is poured into them, as
appears by his words in another Epigram
which give light to this;</p>

            <p>The Aegyptians had a device of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
pictures in their fine linnen cloth,
which was thus; when they had drawn

them (as it were) into the very substance
and contexture of the Webb, and that so
lively, as the Pencil can scarce mend
them, as we have seen in Carpets and
Chamber-hangings, which is an art no
less subtile and ingenious then any of the
rest. These are called <hi>Picturae textiles</hi>

that never fade, Flowers that look fresh
all the year, also Groves and Forrests
that are alwaies green, with all manner
of Beasts and Birds therein, with chases
and Hounds so lively represented, that
there wants nothing but noise and sound
to make up the Game, as <hi>Martiall</hi> said
of the carved Fishes made by <hi>Phidias</hi> so
lively, that there wanted nothing but
water to make them swim.</p>

            <p>There is a certain Shell-fish in the Sea
called <hi>pinna,</hi> that bears a mossie dowl or
wool whereof cloth was spun and made,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:51884:56"/>
as <hi>Tertullian</hi> speaks in his book <hi>de pallio.
Et Arbusta nos vestiunt, &amp; de mari vellera.</hi>
These are his words; not only Trees af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
wool, but also the Sea to clothe us
withal; this wool or moss is so soft and
delicate, that it is nothing inferiour to silk
saith <hi>Lacerda,</hi> and therefore he calls it
<hi>Byssum marinum,</hi> Sea silk, in his notes
upon <hi>Tertullian,</hi> though the true <hi>Byssus</hi>
be lost, and also the <hi>Carbasus,</hi> whence
<hi>Carbasinae vestes,</hi> insomuch that great
Clerks can scarce tell us what they were,
but that fine Stuffs were anciently made
of them. One <hi>Ferdinand Imperatus,</hi> a
Drugster of <hi>Naples,</hi> a great storer of exo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique
and domestique Rarities, had some
of this Sea-silk both weaved and unwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
and also the Shell-fish that did bear
it. Men have found a way not only <hi>ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bores
Nere, sed &amp; lapides,</hi> not only to spin
threads from Trees, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> speaks
of the <hi>Seres,</hi> but also from stones. There
is a stone called <hi>Lapis Caristius,</hi> and <hi>Lapis
Cyprius,</hi> from the Countries that this
stone or mineral is found, to wit <hi>Cyprus</hi>
as <hi>Strabo,</hi> and mount <hi>Caristus</hi> in <hi>Attica,</hi>
as <hi>Trallianus</hi> and <hi>Dioscorides</hi> report; it is
like Allom in colour, and being beaten
with a Mallet, it shews like a small hair,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:51884:56"/>
therefore called <hi>Trichitis,</hi> or the hayrie
stone by some Greek Authors, &amp; <hi>Alumen
Plumaceum,</hi> or downy Alom, by the
Latinists it is also called for the resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
of it, <hi>villus Salamandrae,</hi> Salaman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
wool:<note place="margin">Langii E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist. Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cin.</note> This hair or dowl is spun into
thread, and weaved into cloth, and the
cloth so made hath this strange property,
that being cast into the fire it will not
burn, but if it be foul or stained, comes
forth more bright and clean out of the
flames; it is therefore called also <hi>Amian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus.
Ferdinand Imperatus</hi> (before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned)
had a piece of this cloth much
like white silk. Of this hairy stone some
made wick for candles that would not
consume or burn out: such a candle was
made by <hi>Callimachus,</hi> and hung up in the
Temple of <hi>Minerva</hi> at <hi>Athens,</hi> as <hi>Salma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi>
relates in his <hi>Plinianae exercitationes:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There was a vegetable of this kinde, a
sort of Flax called by the Grecians <hi>Asbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stos</hi>
and <hi>Asbestinos,</hi> that had the like pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
with the mineral before mention'd,
saith the same <hi>Salmasius,</hi> whereof <hi>Pliny</hi>
makes mention in <hi>l.</hi> 9. of his History, <hi>c.</hi> 1
and calls it Indian flax, and <hi>linum v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

quick inconsumptible flax. <hi>Solinus</hi> makes
mention of some sayls made in <hi>Crete</hi> of
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:51884:57"/>
this stuff, <hi>quae inter ignes valebant</hi> (as he
saith) that would not take fire, if it hath
this property indeed, it is pity to put it to
such vulgar use as to serve for sayls, that
would better serve at our tables; for if
men had table-clothes and napkins of this
stuff, they might prefet them before Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
and Damasks, for it would save
some cost &amp; no small trouble in washing
and drying such houshold implements, it
is but throwing them into the fire, and
they are presently washed and dryed at
once.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pliny</hi> indeed esteemed it equivalent to
pearl and precious stone, for it was hard
to be found, and difficult to be weaved,
for the shortness of it (as he says) the
bodies of Kings were used to be wrapt in
this kinde of cloth when they were to be
burnt, that the ashes might be preserved
unmixt, for to be laid up in urns or pitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
as the manner then was.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pliny</hi> saw some Napkins of this sort in
his time, and the experiment of their
purifying demonstrated. One <hi>Podocattar</hi>
a Cyprian Knight, and who wrote <hi>de
rebus Gypriis</hi> in the year 1566. had both
flax and cloth of this sort with him at
<hi>Venice,</hi> and one <hi>Thomas Porcacchius</hi> hath
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:51884:57"/>
seen the same in that Knights house, and
many others with him, as he relates in his
work concerning the Rites of Funerals.
<hi>Ludovicus Vives</hi> also saw a Towel of
that kinde at <hi>Louaine</hi> in <hi>Brabant,</hi> as he
relates in his Commentary upon S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine
de Civitate Dei, l. 21. c.</hi> 6.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Baptista Porta</hi> saw the same at <hi>Venice</hi>
with a woman of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> and calls it
<hi>Secretum optimum, perpulchrum, perutile,</hi>
a very useful and profitable secret, <hi>Nat.

            <p>As stones and trees have been spun and
weaved into cloth, so some mettals may
be wrought to that use; <hi>Attalic</hi> garments
were weav'd all of gold &amp; thread, which

OR,
Of the Art of Musick, with
sundry Instruments there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
belonging.</head>
            <p>THere is Musick in heaven and
Musick on the way thither, in
the sphears, as the Pythagoreans affirm:
and therefore the soul of man being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended
from heaven, &amp; passing through
those harmonious sphears, doth naturally
delight in Harmony: <hi>Anima in corpus
defert memoriam Musicae, cujus in coelo
conscia fuit,</hi> saith <hi>Macrob. l. 2. in somn. Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pionis.</hi>
Nay, God made the body of
man (wherein this musical soul is to so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journ)
a kinde of a <hi>living Organ</hi> or
Musical instrument: <hi>Life is an harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
Lesson</hi> (as one saith) <hi>which the soul
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:51884:61"/>
playes upon the Organs of the body.</hi> There
is but one pipe to this <hi>Organ</hi> (to wit) the
Weasand; the Lungs are the bellows
to make winde, and to inspire this pipe;
yet with this one pipe (being variously
stopt) we can express a thousand sorts
of notes and tunes, and make most ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vishing
musick; for there is no Harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
that is so delightfull and pleasing to
man as <hi>vocal,</hi> or the musick of man's
voice.</p>
            <p>In imitation of this musical pipe in
the throat of man, men devised to
make musick with a <hi>Syringe</hi> or Reed;
which being bored with holes, and stopt
with the fingers, and inspired with mans
breath, was made to yield various and
delightfull sounds. This was <hi>Pastoral
Musick</hi> or <hi>Shepherds Delight,</hi> and was the
invention of <hi>Pan</hi> the God of Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds,
and of the <hi>Arcadian</hi> plains, in
those golden dayes.</p>

that name, but (in the moral) in love
with that Pastoral musick of the Reed
then in use. <hi>Lucretius</hi> doth ascribe the
first hint of this Pastoral musick to the
<hi>whistling</hi> of the winds among the reeds,
in his 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> book.</p>

(as <hi>Pliny</hi> testifieth) that is, single or
simple Musick, and therefore probably
the first; for men naturally do light
upon single or simple notions, before
mixt or compound, and begin with plain
things before they proceed to finer curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>osities;

                  </gap> moods.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There were Musical Instruments in
the world before <hi>Pans</hi> time. <hi>Jubal</hi> the
son of <hi>Lamech</hi> was <hi>pater omnium tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctantium
citharam &amp; organon,</hi> as the holy
Spirit speaks, <hi>Gen. 4. 21. pater,</hi> that is, in
Hebrew sense, the Author and Inventor
of the Harp and Organ, but what kinde
of Instruments these were, <hi>Moses</hi> doth
not inform us.</p>
            <p>The Aegyptian <hi>Mercury</hi> was the first
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:51884:63"/>
Inventor of the Lyre or Harp. <hi>Horace</hi>
calls him <hi>curvae lyrae parentem.</hi> The
Invention was casual, thus: Finding a
Tortoise-shell near the Nile-side, to the
which some nerves or strings did hang,
reaching from the one end to the other;
these strings having been dryed by the
sun and well stretched, and being acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally
touched with the fingers, gave a
shrill sound or twang from the hollow of
the shell; which gave him (being saga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious)
a hint of framing the Lyre, or (as
others say) the Lute. As <hi>du-Bartas</hi>
(for one) who speaking of this <hi>Mercury</hi>
and the Tortoise-shell, sings thus, in his
<hi>Handicrafts.</hi>
            </p>
            <l>And by this mould frames the
melodious Lute,</l>
            <l>That makes woods hearken and
the stones be mute;</l>
            <l>The hills to dance, the heavens
go retrograde,</l>
            <l>Lions be tame, and tempests
quickly vade.</l>
            <p>Indeed, the <hi>Lute</hi> doth much resemble
the Tortoise-shell, and from that resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance

            <p>What some have invented, others
have perfected: <hi>Terpander</hi> made a Lyre
or Harp of seven strings which before
had but three, answerable to these three
principal notes of <hi>Treble, Mean,</hi> and
<hi>Base,</hi>
            </p>
            <l>Obloquitur numeris septem discri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mina

            <p>
               <hi>Simonides</hi> added an eighth string, and
<hi>Timotheus</hi> a ninth, and holy <hi>David</hi> makes
mention of a <hi>Decachord</hi> or ten-stringed
Instrument.</p>
            <p>Many Instruments have been inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by K. <hi>David</hi> for to be used in Gods
service. But all sorts of these <hi>vafa Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tici,</hi>
(as <hi>Amos</hi> calls them, <hi>Am.</hi> 6. 5.) of
these musical Utensils, are divided into

Pipes, Trumpets, Cornets, Sacbuts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
Of the other sort, are the Lute, Harp,
Organ, Psaltery, Virginal, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments
of Musick were by the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines
called <hi>Organa,</hi> Organs. But that
which is more especially called by that
name, makes a grave solemn Musick
like the sober <hi>Doric,</hi> and hath been very
anciently used (with Psalmodies) in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Service; the Inventor whereof was
King <hi>David,</hi> as some affirm. Since his
time, men have proceeded to marvellous
Curiosities both in Musick and Musical
Instruments. Not many years since,
there was a pair of Organs made in
<hi>Italy</hi> that would sound either Drum or
Trumpet, or a full quire of men, as the
<hi>Organist</hi> pleased; so that men would
think they heard boyes and men distinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
sing their parts in Consort, as <hi>Leander
Alberti</hi> (an eye and ear-witness thereof)
relates, in his description of <hi>Italy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A <hi>Neapolitan</hi> Artizan made a pair of
Organs all of Alabaster stone, pipes,
keyes and jacks, with a loud lusty
sound, which he aftrrward bestowed
upon the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> and which
<hi>Leander Alberti</hi> saw in the said Dukes
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:51884:64"/>
Court, as he relates in his description of
<hi>Thuscany.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The same <hi>Leander</hi> saw a pair of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans
at <hi>Venice</hi> made all of Glass, that
made a delectable sound. This is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
also by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Morison</hi> in his Travels.
Pope <hi>Sylvester</hi> the Second made in his
younger years a pair of Organs that
should play without an Organist;<note place="margin">Genebr. Chron. ad Ann. 997.</note> he
used onely warm water to give them
motion and sound. Such <hi>Hydraulics</hi> are
frequent in <hi>Italy,</hi> that are moved with
cold water as well as hot.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gaudentius Merula</hi> in his 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> book <hi>de
mirabilibus mundi</hi> makes mention of an
Organ in the Church of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Ambrose</hi> in
<hi>Millain,</hi> whereof the pipes were some of
wood, some of brass, and some of white
Lead; which being played upon did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
the sound of Cornets, Flutes,
Drums and Trumpets with admirable
variety and concord.</p>
            <p>Many persons can sing very well na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally,
but this natural Musick may be
improved by Art, when they are taught
to sing by Rules and Notes, and to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
their voices by acquired habits;
and so there is an Art of Musick, as
there is artificial Logick besides the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural:
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:51884:65"/>
but because these natural Singers
are but few and scarce,</p>
            <l>Apparent rari nantes in gurgite
vasto;</l>
            <p>therefore to supply this defect, some
have musical Instruments for harmless
pleasure and delight, to appease the cares
of life, and for many other laudable and
honest uses, which I shall more largely
handle in the ensuing Appendix of the
Power and efficacy of Musick.</p>

                  <hi>Randolph</hi>'s Muse is in the same key
in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendation of Musick, who because
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:51884:66"/>
he hath expressed the power of Musick
to the height of Fancy, I thought good
to insert his <hi>Rapture</hi> in this place.</p>
               <l>Musick, thou <hi>Queen of Souls!</hi> get up
and string</l>
               <l>Thy powerful Lute, and some sad <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiem</hi>

               <l>Till Rocks requite thy Eccho with a

               <l>And the dull Cliffs repeat the duller

               <l>Then on a sudden with a gentle hand,</l>
               <l>Run gently o're the Chords, and so
command</l>
               <l>The Pine to dance, the Oak his roots
forgo,</l>
               <l>The Holme, and aged Elme to foot it
too,</l>
               <l>Myrtles shall caper, lofty Cedars run</l>
               <l>And call the Courtly Palm to make

               <l>Then in the midd'st of all this jolly
train,</l>
               <l>Strike a sad Note, and fix them Trees
again.</l>
               <p>That Musick hath any such power o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
things <hi>inanimate</hi> I shall suspend my
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:51884:66"/>
faith; but that it hath a great impression
upon all things endued with sence, I shall
evince by good proofs.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Regina sensuum,</hi> as <hi>Cassiodor</hi> calls
it, Queen Regent of our senses, and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign
Mistris of our affections.</p>
               <p>Of all the creatures that God made,
there is none that makes Musick or Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
but Man and Birds; but as among
men all do not sing tuneably to delight
the ear if they would never so fain: So
among Birds, all are not fit for the Quire
or Cage; There are but few sorts among
the infinite variety of them, that are Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sical.
Nevertheless though all men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
make Musick; yet all are delighted
with it; so for birds and beasts, though
all do not sing, yet are all affected with
melody and singing.</p>
               <p>But to come from the Thesis to the
Hypothesis, I will descend to some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
instances, to shew the regency and
power of Musick over insensible crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.

<pb n="115" facs="tcp:51884:67"/>

That story is recorded by <hi>Herodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi>
and <hi>Aul. Gellius,</hi> and many other
grave Historians, and it was briefly thus,
<hi>Arion</hi> being at Sea, and sailing towards
his own Country of <hi>Lesbos,</hi> some of his
companions that were with him on ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board
knowing that he had money about
him, conspired to rob him, and then to
throw him into the Sea; <hi>Arion</hi> being
made acquainted with their purpose, and
having his Harp with him, desired so
much respite that he might give them a
lesson for a farewel, and then let them
do their pleasure; when he had ended
his lesson, and (like the Swan) has sung
his own Dirge and last Notes (as he
thought) in this world, he was thrown
over-board; but it hapned that some
Dolphins having gathered together a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Ship to hear his ravishing notes,
one of them (in requital of his Musick)
took <hi>Arion</hi> on his back, and wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

safe to his own shore, and there laid down
his load. In memory whereof the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture

               <p>To illustrate this, I will give certain
historical instances or examples of each
kinde.</p>
               <p>1. Musick stirs up Anger and Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
especially that which they call
<hi>Phrygian</hi> Music, which consists of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
and loud notes and <hi>sprightfull</hi> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:51884:69"/>
and this is usefull for the warrs;
and therefore Drums, Trumpets and
Cornets have been (anciently) used a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
most nations to encourage the
souldiers in the field. <hi>Virgil</hi> speaking of
<hi>Misenus (Aeneas</hi> his Trumpeter) gives
this character of him.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Tyrteus</hi> that brave Commander of
<hi>Lacedaemon</hi> made use of the Trumpet
against the <hi>Messensians,</hi> with whose un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wonted
sound they were much terrified,
as his own souldiers were much anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
therewith, as they were also with his
Songs and Poems, as <hi>Horace</hi> testifies in
his <hi>Art of Poetry.</hi>
               </p>
               <l>—Post hos, insignis <hi>Homerus,</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Horace,</hi> who had been a souldier for
some years himself, speaks of his <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biton</hi>
which he had used in the warr, and
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:51884:69"/>
which now he meant to hang up for a
monument after his return home:</p>

               <p>2. As it <hi>stirs</hi> up Anger, so it doth <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay</hi>
and appease it, and conjures down
that spirit which it raiseth up; <hi>Cantando
malos affectus incantamus. Timotheus</hi>
the Musician could both enrage and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calm
the Great <hi>Alexander</hi> at his pleasure,
onely by the different streins of his Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sic.
<hi>Clinias</hi> the Pythagorean when hee
began to be heated with anger, would
take his <hi>Lute</hi> to compose his affections;
and <hi>Achilles</hi> (the great Souldier) was
wont to do the like, as <hi>Aelian</hi> reports of
them both. <hi>Var. l. 14. c.</hi> 23. this is <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceus
pacis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Harp is <hi>Tela Musarum loquax,</hi> as
<hi>Cassiodor</hi> wittily stiles it, a speaking kind
of Instrument, whereby a man speaks
his passions without a tongue, and by
those <hi>verbosa stamina</hi> doth tell his tale
more effectually then he can with the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Organs of his speech. Therefore
the <hi>Getes</hi> (knowing the power of Musick
to move clemency) did use to send harps
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:51884:70"/>
and Musicians with those Embassadours
that went to treat for peace and amitie.
<hi>Ludovicus Pius</hi> the Emperour did set
<hi>Theodulpus</hi> at liberty when he heard him
sing an <hi>Anthem,</hi> which he had composed
in Prison.</p>
               <p>3. Musick <hi>exhilarateth</hi> the spirits and
expelleth the evil spirit of melancholy,
as <hi>David (the sweet singer of Israel</hi>) drave
(with his celestial streins) the evil spirit
out of <hi>Saul,</hi> and put him out of posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
without any other <hi>exorcism</hi> then
that of Musick: It seems the divel does
not love Musick; but I know nothing
else but does. <hi>Scimus Musicam Daemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus
invisam &amp; intolerabilem esse,</hi> saith <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
in <hi>Epist. ad Senfelium Masicum.</hi> This
may be better called <hi>Fuga Daemonum</hi>
than the herb <hi>Hyperion. Melancholy is
the Devils Bath,</hi> wherein he takes much
delight. And therefore, since Musick is
an enemy to Melancholy, we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
that it is an enemy to the Divel:
Musick hath too much of heaven to give
him any delight; he loves jarrs and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
better than concord and harmony.</p>
               <p>4. This does compose men to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,
contemplation, and godly sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
especially the grave <hi>Doric</hi> Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:51884:70"/>
of the Church. Saint <hi>Augustine</hi>
did shed tears when hee heard the
solemn Musick of the Church at
<hi>Millain,</hi> as he confesseth in the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of
his <hi>Confessions.</hi> Hereby our devotion
is exalted, our souls lifted up to heaven
with those ecchoing sounds, and our spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
better prepared and disposed for
prophetick raptures and divine illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations.
When <hi>Elisha</hi> was desired to
Prophesie by King <hi>Jehoshaphat,</hi> he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
for a <hi>Minstrel</hi> to make musick, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to defecate and clear his spirits; and
as the minstrel play'd, the hand of the
Lord came upon him and he prophesied
victory and good tidings to the King, 1
<hi>King.</hi> 3. 15. and that the Prophets did
commonly use musical Instruments for
that purpose, as we may learn from the
first book of <hi>Sam. cap. 14. v.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>5. To these I may add in the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> place,
that Musick doth avail (not a little) to
chastity, sobriety and civil conversation,
as it may be used and applyed. When
some young men of <hi>Taurominum</hi> were
about to force open a house upon some
women that they had a minde to, <hi>Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras</hi>
coming casually by, did appease
their mindes and reduce them to a better
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:51884:71"/>
mood, by making a Minstrel (that they
had with them) to change his notes from
nimble <hi>Dactyls</hi> or <hi>triple</hi> time into slow
<hi>Spondaics,</hi> &amp; so did becalm their hot and
unruly spirits. <hi>Spondae<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in <hi>Orator instit l. 1. cap.</hi> 10. A <hi>Spondey</hi> or
Spondaic foot is a <hi>grave</hi> time consisting
of two long syllables, so that if there
be many of them in a verse, they make
it to be of a slow heavy motion, like the

               <p>Whereas the nimble Dactyls (whereof

when he went to the warrs, he left a Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:51884:71"/>
with his wife <hi>Clitemnestra</hi> for to
keep her chaste, by singing grave <hi>Doric</hi>

<hi>rude</hi> and <hi>savage</hi> people have been civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,

                  <l>And hence <hi>Amphion</hi> (who built

               </lg>
               <p>As Musick hath power over the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
of man, so it hath over his body too,
and that in two respects; partly, to keep
it from drooping and weariness, while it
is at work; and partly to cure it of some
maladies, as I shall produce examples of
both.</p>
               <p>1. It avails to keep the body from
weariness and irksomness, and drooping
from under its dayly cares, toil &amp; labor.
<hi>Horace</hi> calls his Lute <hi>Dulce laborum le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimen,</hi>
the gentle easer of labour and
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:51884:72"/>
pains-taking. And <hi>Quintilian</hi> sayes,
That Nature seems to have given this
gift of Musick to mankinde for this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
purpose; and from hence it is that all
sorts of people use commonly to deceive
the tediousness of their dayly-task with
with some melodie. <hi>Parrhasius</hi> the Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
used to sing while he was at work.
<hi>Cantu &amp; modulatione submissâ, laborem
artis mitigare solebat;</hi> so <hi>Aelian</hi> tells us,
<hi>lib. 9. cap.</hi> 11. The Husband man sings
or whistles at his work.</p>
               <l>Altâ sub rupe canit frondator ad
auras.</l>
               <p>And his good wife at her wheel at home
makes some notes also that serve to
please her, if they please no body else.</p>
               <l>Interea longum cantu solata laborem</l>
               <l>Arguto conjux percurrit pectine telas.</l>
               <p>And if men over-toyl themselves and
be tired out with labour, Musick is very
helpfull to recreate their spirits, and to
make them fresh and vigorous again:
<hi>Musica est medicina molestiae illius quae
per labores suscipitur,</hi> saith (the <hi>Patriarch
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:51884:73"/>
of Philosophie) Aristotle.</hi> And <hi>Tully</hi> saith
of the <hi>Pythagoreans,</hi> that after they had
been weary with intentive studies, their
usual manner was to solace themselves in
the evenings with Musick, as hard stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
in our Universities use to do now
adayes.</p>
               <p>2. As this heavenly gift expells <hi>wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riness</hi>
from our bodies, so it expells some
<hi>maladies</hi> too. The Old Greek <hi>Bard (Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi>)
saith, the Grecians did cure the
plague with Musick, in the first book of
his <hi>Iliads.</hi> The reason of this cure is,
because Musick chears up the spirits and
expells sadness, than which nothing is
more fatal in a time of Mortality, or
makes the body more obnoxious to the
tyranny of diseases.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Corporibus vires subtrahit ipse timor:</hi>
Fear and sadness betrayeth the succours
that nature hath provided for her own
defence, and doth expose our bodies na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
to the malignity of the air and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasion
of any malady. Hereof you may
finde more in the writings of Physiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
and particularly <hi>Langius</hi> in the 3.<hi rend="sup">d</hi>
book of <hi>Medicinal Epistles</hi> tells us of
<hi>Xenocrates,</hi> that he used to cure Phrene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
persons with songs and musick; and
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:51884:73"/>
of <hi>Theophrastus,</hi> who by his own expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
found that the pains of the <hi>Sciatica</hi>
is much asswaged by Music. They say
in <hi>France,</hi> that Musick doth not cure the
<hi>Tooth-ach:</hi> but yet some aches are cured
by it; for <hi>Macrobius,</hi> to the other vertues
of Musick, adds this, <hi>Corporis morbis
medetur.</hi> But there are two diseases that
are proper (in a manner) to <hi>Germany</hi> and
<hi>Italy,</hi> which are cured by no other means
than Musick. In <hi>Italy,</hi> they that are bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
with that venemous Spider called the
<hi>Tarantula</hi> become Phrenetick, and the
only way to cure them is to play upon
Instruments unto them; at the sound
whereof they fall a dancing, and bestir
themselves so long untill they are quite
tired and have sweated out the venom
that was shot in by that Insect. In <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi>
also that disease which they call
<hi>Chorus S<hi rend="sup">ti</hi> Viti,</hi> or <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Vitus</hi> his dance,
is cured with Musick. It is a kinde of
a Phrensie too, and when the Patients
hear any Minstrel play, <hi>saltant ad lassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudinem
simul &amp; sanitatem,</hi> as <hi>Shenkius</hi>
saith; they dance presently, and never
give over till they are both tired and
cured.</p>
               <p>And these are sufficient proofs to shew
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:51884:74"/>
the <hi>power</hi> and <hi>efficacy</hi> of Musick both
over man and beast, and in man both
over his body and minde. The truth is,
we may observe, that <hi>soluta Oratio,</hi> plain
prose, without harmony or meter, hath
a great sway over mens mindes, if it be
gracefully and pathetically delivered.
The Orators among the <hi>Grecians</hi> had
the power of fire and water, to enflame
and to extinguish, to make peace or
warr; such was <hi>Demosthenes</hi> in <hi>Athens.</hi>

their courage withall, that they took

               <l>Sweet Musick makes the sternest

               <l>Let fall at once their anger and their

               <l>
                  <pb n="130" facs="tcp:51884:75"/>In deadly torments makes them

the busie swarm</l>

               <l>O! what is it Musick cannot do,</l>
               <l>Sith th'al inspiring spirits it conquers
too?</l>

               <p>
                  <hi>Baptista Porta</hi> doth ascribe the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
effects of Musick to the several
sorts of trees that the instruments are
made of, whether the Vine or the Elder,
the Poplar, Laurel, or the like; which
(saith he) have a secret property to cure
diseases, more then the sounds that are
made by them: but he is mistaken here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in;
for we know what power inartificial
sounds and bare words (without Musick
added) have over mens mindes and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:51884:75"/>
                  <hi>Scaliger</hi> argues the case thus: The
Vibration or trembling of the air (cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by vocal or instrumental Musick)
doth move and affect the spirits in mans
body, which are subtile vapours of the
blood and the instruments of the soul in
all her operations; which spirits affect
the soul as well as body, so that apt

so that the Venice glasses do bear the bell
from all others: Here to make their glas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
so clear and transparent, and so like
Coristal, they dip it (while it is hot) in
clean water, whereby it is clarified, and
made like the water it self, wherein it is
so tincted and seasoned. Though the
glass we now use be brittle ware, and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
shattered in pieces, yet there was an
Artist in <hi>Rome</hi> in the Emperour <hi>Tiberius</hi>
his time, that had found a way to make
glass malleable and yeilding, and such as
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:51884:78"/>
would bow rather then break; for the
man bringing a glass-phial for a present
to the Emperour to shew his art, he threw
the Vessel against the stone pavement,
with which blow it was not broken, but
dented; then taking his hammer he beat
in the dent again, to the no small wonder
of the spectators, as <hi>Dion</hi> relates in the
56<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of his History, and <hi>Suetonius,</hi> with
others. The man was secretly made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,

            <p>The use of glass is various and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold,

            <p>
               <hi>Kircher,</hi> a great Scholar (now living

he never saw or heard of any glasses (of
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:51884:80"/>
late) that would burn above 15 paces di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.
But <hi>Baptista Porta</hi> professes a way
how to make glasses that would burn and
fire things at any distance. And <hi>John Dee,</hi>
an eminent Mathematician of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
doth profess (in a preface to a book
of his called <hi>Monas Hieroglyphica</hi>) the
Art to make a Glass that should calcine
stones and reduce them to impalpable
dust: these are <hi>magnalia Artis.</hi> But these
things have been yet but in speculation
for ought I finde; not but that very
strange and wonderfull things might be
done in this kinde and many other waies,
if there were any encouragement for
Artists, or if any would go to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
of proving some usefull experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,

            <p>
               <hi>Archimedes,</hi> that rare wit of <hi>Syracuse,</hi>
made a Sphear of Glass, which did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present
the perfect order and motions of
the Heavenly bodies, which (besides ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

describes in one of his Epigrams, which
is set down before in the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Athanasius Kircher.</hi>
               <note place="margin">de Magne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te, l. 1.</note> (whom wee
often mentioned) doth affirm, That the
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:51884:80"/>
Sphear was not all of Glass, but onely
the outside of it, that men might the
better discern the wheels and motions
within; yet <hi>Petrus Ramus</hi> tells us, that
he saw at <hi>Paris</hi> two Sphears of Glass
like those of <hi>Archimedes;</hi> one brought
from the <hi>Sicilian,</hi> the other from the

            <p>
               <hi>Marcus Scaurus</hi> made an Amphithea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Glass, as <hi>Pliny</hi> relates in the 36<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
book <hi>cap.</hi> 15. But I finde by others
that the Pavement was of Marble,
and but the middle scene or story of
Glass; which Glass was not our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Glass, neither (as I suppose) but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Obsidian</hi> glass, which the same <hi>Pliny</hi>
mentions elsewhere, and is found (or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was found, for we hear of none
now) in <hi>Aethiopta,</hi> which is very black
like jet, and transparent as glass, friable
and easy to be wrought with the cheesel;
of which sort of glass was the stately
Tomb which <hi>Ptolomy</hi> King of <hi>Egypt</hi>
built at <hi>Alexandria</hi> for a Monument of
<hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, as <hi>Strabo</hi> relates:
And <hi>Herodotus</hi> also tells us,<note place="margin">

The Specular stone was of
this kinde, but that it was brighter

            <p>It was (anciently) used for windowes

            <p>It ws also used for a defence to some

            <p>
               <hi>Leander</hi> in his description of <hi>Italy</hi>
makes mention of a compleat Galley of

Glass. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

            </p>
            <p>As Glass is diaphanous, and permits
a free passage of <hi>species</hi> through its bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
as freely as air or water doth, so it
is also reflexive, and beats back the

used to carry Palm-wines (in tonns) to

a piece in their hands guiding the Vessel.</p>
            <p>These Vessels were so light, that the

would carry his boat by land and the

<hi>Helice</hi> and <hi>Cynosura,</hi> which are therefore
called <hi>Load-stars,</hi> or leading stars; As
Travellers in the Desarts of <hi>Arabia</hi> and
those of <hi>Tartary</hi> were always guided by
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:51884:89"/>
some fixed stars in the night time, to steer
their courses in those pathless &amp; uncouth
ways, so Seamen were directed by the
like heavenly guides, in the pathless wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness
of waters, before this excellent
invention was found out.</p>
               <l>Sidera Cuncta notat tacito labentia Caelo.</l>
               <p>So <hi>Virgil</hi> speaks of <hi>Palinuras,</hi> who was
Shipmaster or chief Pilot and Steersman
to <hi>Aeneas;</hi> but if the sky chanced to be

of a little stone, called (from the use and

                  </gap>s now our Load-star, and the Mariners

stones; as <hi>Rablais</hi> said, that a Milstone
was the most precious stone of any other,
so I may say, that a Loadstone is compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
to all the gems and precious stones

               <p>This stone hath two strange proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
the one of <hi>Attraction,</hi> the other of
<hi>Direction;</hi> this property of <hi>Direction,</hi>
(which chiefly concerns our present busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness)
is, that being set in a dish, and left
to float freely upon the water, it will with
one end point directly to the North, and
with the other to the South, and will
give this faculty or property to a needle
that is rubb'd or touched with it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="160" facs="tcp:51884:90"/>From these two faculties of <hi>Attraction</hi>
and <hi>Direction,</hi> many excellent, useful,
and ingenious Inventions have bin found
out, especially this <hi>Pyxis Nautica,</hi> or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners
Card or Compass, which carries
a needle touched with the Loadstone in
the middle of it, with two and thirty
Rumbs or lines drawn round about it;
according to the number of the Cardinal
and Collateral Winds. Now this ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
needle shews with the Lilly-hand
(or point) the North in any part of the
world, which is a great help to the Pilot
to direct him to what point of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass
to steer his course.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Pyx</hi> or Card is no less useful by
Land then it is by Sea; so that they that
travel through Desarts, as the <hi>Carovans</hi>
do to <hi>Mecha</hi> and <hi>Medina,</hi> and other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
do now make good use of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
whereas heretofore some star was
their best guide by night.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pliny</hi> speaks of the Inhabitants of <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probana</hi>
(now called <hi>Sumatra</hi>) that because
they do not see the <hi>Pole-star</hi> to sayl by,
they carry with them certain birds to sea,
which they do often let fly; and as these
birds by natural instinct fly always to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the land, so the Mariners direct
their course after them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="161" facs="tcp:51884:90"/>In <hi>Syria,</hi> and some Countries of the
East that are covered with sand, so that
there is no tract or path to guide the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller,
and those sands are also scortching
hot, that they cannot be endured by day,
they travel by night, and by the direction
of certain stars, which they use as certain
way-marks to steer their course by: As
<hi>Mor Isaac</hi> in <hi>Philosophia Syriaca.</hi> So also
in the Country of the Bactrians, as <hi>Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
relates: <hi>Navigantium modo Sidera
observant, ad quorum cursum iter dirigunt,
Curt. l.</hi> 7.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lud. Bartema</hi> relates, that they that
travel over the Desarts of <hi>Arabia,</hi> which
are all covered with light and fleeting
sands, so that no track can ever be found,
do make certain boxes of wood, which
they place on Camels backs, and shutting
themselves in the said boxes to keep them
from the sands, and by the help of the
Loadstone like the Mariners Compass,
they steer their course over the vast and
uncouth Desarts. Some do ascribe this
invention to that ingenious people of
<hi>China.</hi> D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Gilbert</hi> affirms, that <hi>Paulus
Venetus</hi> brought it first into <hi>Italy</hi> in the
year 1260, having learn'd it from the
<hi>Chinois,</hi> as he saith <hi>l. 1. de Magnete, c.</hi> 2.
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:51884:91"/>
and <hi>Ludovicus Vertomanus,</hi> another tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller,
saith, that when he was in the East
Indies about the year 1500 (above an
hundred and fifty years since) he saw the
Pilot of his ship direct his course by a
Compass (framed after the same manner
as we have now) when he was sayling
towards <hi>Java.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Mariners Compass is not brought
yet to that perfection, but that it requires
some rectification and amendment; for
the Magnetique Needle doth not exactly
point to the North in all Meridians. but
varies and swerves (in some places more,
in some less) from the Direct posture,
Configuration, and Aspect of the North
and South, which puts Seamen to much
distraction, and makes them run often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
on dangerous errors. <hi>Van Helmont</hi>
a great <hi>Paracelsian</hi> of <hi>Germany,</hi> professeth
a ready way to rectifie this grand incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience,
namely, how to make a Nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
that should never vary or alter from
the right point, which may be performed
by a strong imagination, as he saith, thus;
If a man in framing the Needle shall
stand with his back to the North, and
place one point of the Needle (which he
intends for the North) directly towards
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:51884:91"/>
himself, the Needle so made shall always
point regularly and infallibly toward the
North without variation. I wish that
some <hi>Fancy-full</hi> man of an exalted imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
would make some Needles for
experiment after <hi>Helmont's</hi> direction,
since it is a business of great concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to the publique Weal, to have this
business rectified.</p>

of the <hi>Officiousness</hi> and <hi>Docileness</hi>

            <p>The Lion himself, whom some term

<hi>Mark Anthony</hi> had Lions to draw his

<hi>Primus Romae Leones ad Currum junxit</hi>
M. Antonius, <hi>non sine quodam ostento tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porum,

the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> had a Lion so tame and

lead him with any carriage for to bring it
to Market, as <hi>Plin lib. 8. Nat. Hist. cap.</hi> 16.

But this cost him a Banishment; for the

            <l>—odoratis descendens <hi>Liber</hi> ab Indis</l>

            <p>And that the fierce <hi>Bysons</hi> were taught to

same Poet. As I have seen in <hi>England</hi> by
<hi>Walton</hi> upon <hi>Thames</hi> 4 Stags drawing a

that Stags drew the Coach of <hi>Diana,</hi> as

had a Deer which he bestowed on the
Emperour <hi>Maximilian</hi> the Second, that
would receive a rider on his back, and a
bridle in his mouth, and would run a race
with the fleetest horses that came in the

            <p>The King of <hi>Cambaia</hi> hath tame Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,

            <p>These Examples shew forth the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
of mans spirit, which (by a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet

in <hi>Aegypt</hi> in the Lake of <hi>Myris:</hi> and

that crept upon mens tables among

spake of before in the Chapter of <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. For <hi>Birds</hi> and wilde Fowle, we
may instance in the Estridges, that were
put to draw a Coach; in <hi>Eagles,</hi> that are
trained in <hi>Turky</hi> like Hawks to fly at any
fowl;<note place="margin">Exer. 232.</note> in the <hi>Crow,</hi> that <hi>Scaliger</hi> saw in
the French Kings Court, that was taught
to flye at Partridges, or any other fowl,
from the Falconers fist; and lastly, in
Wilde-<hi>Ducks,</hi> that are tamed and made
<hi>Decoyes,</hi> to intice and betray their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
which is commonly known.</p>
            <p>4. Then fourthly, for things in the
<hi>Sea</hi> that have been tamed, we may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
in a fish called the <hi>Manati,</hi> or <hi>Sea-Cow,</hi>
well known about <hi>Hispaniola</hi> and
other places of the West-Indies; it hath
the form of a Cow, and hath four feet,
and comes often to land to eat grass:
<hi>Peter Martyr</hi> in his <hi>Decads</hi> speaks of an
Indian Cacique or Lord of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
that had one of these tame Cows,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:51884:95"/>
that would eat meat out of his hands,
and was as sportfull as an Ape, &amp; would
carry his sons and servants (sometimes
ten of them at a time) on his back, and
waft them over a great Lake from one
shore to another. We may instance al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
in the Sea-Horse that hath been ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
and made tractable to carry men
on his back, as <hi>Leo Afer</hi> reports of one he
had seen, in his History of <hi>Africa;</hi> and
in the Fish called <hi>Reversus,</hi> by whose help
and admirable industry, the Indians used
to catch Fish in the Sea, as <hi>Bodin</hi> relates
in the third book of his <hi>Theatrum Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rae:</hi>
He is let loose at the prey, as the
Greyhound from the slip, as <hi>Purchas</hi>
saith; and <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> hath the like sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of it in his <hi>Decads: Pliny</hi> speaks the
same of Dolphins, which he had seen
(in some places) to be used for to catch
Fish, and to bring them to shore, and
upon receiving some part of the prey, to
go their ways; and if they failed in some
point of service, they suffered themselves
patiently to be corrected, as Setting-Dogs,
and Qua-Ducks, or Decoy Ducks
(as we commonly call them) use to be.
This same is affirmed of the Dolphins
by <hi>Oppianus</hi> a learned Writer, in his
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:51884:96"/>
               <hi>Halieuticks.</hi> Otters have been tamed,
and taught to drive Fish into the Net,
as Dogs use to drive cattle into the Fold,
as <hi>Cardan</hi> relates.</p>
            <p>But this is not all, wilde beasts and
birds have been tamed not only for the
service, but also for the pleasure and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stime
of man: As man hath learn'd some
Arts from them, so they have learn'd
some from man: Camels have been
taught to dance, as the African <hi>Leo</hi> hath
seen in his Country. Elephants have
also been taught the same; and not only
on the earth, but also in the air, <hi>ambulare
per funem,</hi> to dance upon the Ropes:
<hi>Seneca</hi> is my Author for it, <hi>Epist.</hi> 85. The
manner of teaching them to dance is
thus,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sands</hi> Travels.</note> They bring some young Elephant
or Camel upon a floor of earth, that
hath been heated underneath, and they
play on a Cittern or Tabor, while the
poor beast lifts up his stumps from the
hot floor very often, more by reason of
the heat then any lust to dance; and this
they practise so often, until the beast hath
got such a habit of it, that when ever he
hears any Musique he falls a dancing.
<hi>Bubsequius</hi> saw a dancing Elephant in
<hi>Constantinople,</hi> and the same Elephant
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:51884:96"/>
playing at ball, tossing it to another man
with his Trunk, and receiving it back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Michael Neander</hi> saw in <hi>Germany</hi> a
bear brought from <hi>Poland,</hi> that would
play upon the Tabor, and dance some
measures, yea dance within the compass
of a round Cap, which he would after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
hold up in his paw to the Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
to receive money (or some other
boon) for his pains. There was a dance
of Horses presented at the marriage of
the Duke of <hi>Florence,</hi> which Sir <hi>Kenelm
Digby</hi> mentions.<note place="margin">Treatise <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

            <p>The <hi>Sybarites</hi> (a people of <hi>Italy</hi> being

Horses to dance; The <hi>Crotonians</hi> hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

with them some Flutes and Flutinists to
the War, who had direction to pipe it as

whereupon the <hi>Sybarites</hi> Horses, instead
