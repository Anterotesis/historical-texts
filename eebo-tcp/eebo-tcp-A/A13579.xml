            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE MOST NOBLE PRINCE, HENRY PRINCE OF WALES.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Ost noble Prince. It succee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth with the Art of Logike, as it doth with a drug of rare vertues: which resting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined within the limits of the Apothecaries shop, winneth not anie opinion or credit with men: but being taken out and skilfully applied, discloseth her value &amp; me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. So this art resting imprisoned within the lists of the schoole and the cabinets of the learned, findeth no grace or regard: but being drawne foorth as it were into the field of imployment and seruice, it doth then manifest to the world the proportion of worth and respect, that is due vnto her. For to be able, first to contriue and perfit the frame of a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course: and then againe to discouer and lay foorth in the pure naturals not onely the seuerall members, but the particular structure and conformation of the same: what estimation doth it not deserue? And this
<pb facs="tcp:18936:3"/>
is it which Logike doth vndertake and performe. Out of the former imployment this worthie art fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisheth vnto vs varietie and choise of arguments for cleering the cause in question: and directeth vs to hold that, which is true and iustifiable: to disclaime that, which is inconsequent: to marshall each thing in his proper ranke and place. Out of the other vse and seruice it yeeldeth vnto vs a benefit of no lesse moment and aduantage: wee being guided by her addresse in the examination and triall of the worke made: to the end we may not be deceiued with any outward lustre and shew, but be exactly informed how sound and warrantable it is, that is propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Hereupon answerably to the direction in this behalfe, in the first place wee consider what the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per subiect is, that is deduced and handled: the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obseruation whereof being the originall of an erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious and misguided course in iudging. For as wee cannot iudge with what commendation and credit, either the Canonier dischargeth his shot, being ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the marke whereat he leuelled: or the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uigator performeth his course, being not made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted to what cape or port he would arriue: so in case it be vnknowne vnto vs what is the peculiar different and position debated in anie tractate or speech, we cannot discerne with what soundnes and wisedome the dispute is managed: we cannot chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge ought as impertinent: nor take exception to inconsequences. Hauing found and obserued the question, we are in the second place to examine the qualitie of the proofes alleaged, and how iudiciously the illustration thereof is carried. Wherein if we shal proceed by the square of this art: whatsoeuer is base
<pb facs="tcp:18936:3"/>
or fine in the mettall of any discourse, this artificiall touchstone of Logike will vpon application and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all immediatly detect. It will in particularitie shew whether the wit hath failed in the search of allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: and whether error in liew of truth, inconse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence in steede of an vncensurable conclusion, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order in place of methodicall proceeding hath been intertained. Neither must we apprehend that in this imployment she is like the vnskilfull Painter, who cannot with his pensill represent other forme than of a fish. This may I truly auouch, that as there is no obiect visible, which the well affected eye hauing the concurrence of a fit and rightly disposed meane see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not: and no magnitude which the learned hand of the Mathematician measureth not: so there is no subiect of what nature soeuer, falling within the reach of naturall reason, which by Logike the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse image thereof cannot be disputed. Out of this large extent it is, that the said art is of excellent and meritorious seruice in deliberations and resolutions of State, in courts of equitie and iustice, in the field and consultations militarie, yea in all questions of humane and ciuill consideration. That matters di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine and Theologicall are not excepted, but that in the handling and iudging of them also Logike ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth for a singular light and helpe: I appeale to the Diuines of this and all former ages. For a further proofe whereof and by way of instance in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe: though I am not of that reuerend and worthy profession, hauing been imployed in seruices of a different qualitie: yet haue I of late in this time of my idlenes, vnder hope of pardon at the hands of our professed Theologians, attempted by the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb facs="tcp:18936:4"/>
of the said Art an Analysis of certaine choise Psalmes. This Analysis I haue presumed (most noble Prince) to dedicate vnto your Highnes, not onely that it might serue as a pledge of my indisguised and perpetuall deuotion to your seruice: but for that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the subiect analysed is a meditation performed by a great Prince, and for the nature thereof no argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of vulgar and humane conceit, but surpassing and diuine: and therefore a Prince in either respect the fittest person for a dedication of this kinde. To tender the work of a great Potentate vnto one of an inferiour representation and ranke, would be liable to the exception of disparagement. Neither doth it cease in regard of the vnfolding &amp; exposing thereof to view, to be the act of a Prince: no more than ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable excellencies leaue to be such, when they are discabineted &amp; presented to the eye. And whereas it is an inspired &amp; sacred work, it is vpon this ground also not vnmeete to bee exhibited vnto Princes. For they holding their royalties and honours at the will and pleasure of the Lord of Lords, cannot o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise assure their inuestiture and interest in them, than by a course of obedience vnto his will. This o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience is not performable without information taken of what is pleasing. This information is taken from the voyce onely of the Lord in Scripture. This voice is the precept there deliuered, or the iustifiable and recommended practise of sanctified persons. Now this subiect, whereof I make tender vnto your Highnes in a Logicall Analysis (whereby it is strip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped as it were of all outward habit, and laid foorth in the first and naturall lineaments) is able to supplie vnto the greatest Princes speciall direction both out
<pb facs="tcp:18936:4"/>
of precept and president, how to please him who hath thus aduanced and honoured them. Would your Highnes be informed what person it is, who onely is capable of a blessed and prosperous estate? The first Psalme will resolue you that the person of a Prince, as he is a Prince, is not the seate of this bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sednes and felicitie, but so farre foorth as he is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son whose delight is in the law of the Lord. And therefore the Prophet in the Psalme following, out of a desire that Kings and Princes should partake in the glorie of this happinesse, earnestly perswadeth them to the doing of homage and worship vnto Christ Iesus: which is a course of pietie, wherein be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides their presenting in priuate of all spirituall ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice vnto him, they professe withall in publike their alleageance and readie obedience to the royall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie and lawes of his kingdome. Would your Highnes be aduertised what sort of people they are, whom you ought specially to respect and esteeme? The Psalmist will tell you out of his owne practise, Psal. 16. that they are the worthies and excellent of the earth. Would your Highnes vnderstand what loue and regard you are to beare to the Sanctuarie and place of the Lords worship? It may please you to take notice hereof out of the 84. Psalme: where King <hi>Dauid</hi> imparteth with vs his passionate longing to returne vnto the house of the Lords publike ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, recommending it by way of admiraiton as most worthie of al respect and affection on our part: and valuing his participation there with the godly in the said seruice aboue all the regalities and honors in this world. Would your Highnes bee presented
<pb facs="tcp:18936:5"/>
with a picture of the miseries whereto both Prince and people are subiect? This picture the 90. Psalme with the 39. affoordeth vnto vs. There Princes may learne that our fairest and best daies are vexation and griefe: that Man, and whatsoeuer is of strength and excellencie in man, is for weaknes and brittlenes like a moth: that our life for length is as a spanne, as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, as a day past, a watch in the night, a dreame, a word, a thought. Would your Highnes behold as it were in a glasse the singular aduantages and priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of depending on the Lord? This glasse will the 91. Psalme furnish vnto you. To be short: if your Highnes desire to see a president how a Prince shuld demeane himselfe, either in the case of any his ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitall transgressions against the Lord, or in the case of blasphemie committed by others: the cariage of this worthie King <hi>Dauid</hi> will in either case serue for a most worthy president. In the 51. Psalme, whereas hee had by misgouernment of his person mightily transgressed, being admonished hereof by <hi>Nathan</hi> one of the Lords faithful remembrancers, he perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth two remarkable duties: the one of humbling himselfe before the Lord out of a repentant heart: the other of earnest mediation, that the Lord would be pleased not to interpret his transgression to the preiudice of the Church and Common-wealth of Israel. In the 94. Psalme, finding himselfe disabled to proceede in iustice against some, who being not contented to tyrannize the Lords people, did with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all disgorge blasphemie against the Lord himselfe, he doth first solicite the Lord to a reall execution of his wrath against them: and then by a quick and
<pb facs="tcp:18936:5"/>
pertinent apology he cleereth the glorious and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full name of the Lord from all imputation and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour. You see hereby (most worthie Prince) the ground and inducement of this my dedication: which if it may in these your tender yeeres be of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny vse vnto your Highnes, either for instruction in the knowledge of that eternall Lord, who will ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour Princes in case they honour him, or for admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of dutie in your cariage towards him: I shall attaine to the scope of my deseigne herein. The al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie King so blesse your Highnes in the course of your education, that it may be a meane to supply your noble heart with all prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vertues, and draw vpon your person all honourable happinesse.</p>

                  <p>The question disputed by the Prophet in this Psalme is this:
<list>
                        <item>That the godlie man onelie is blessed, <hi>vers. 1, 2.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He scope of the Psalmist in clearing this question is to rectifie our conceit and iudgement touching the person who is capable of blessednesse: and so consequently to perswade vnto holines of life. For if, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to the opinion of the wise in the world (of whom some haue seated felicitie in persons ciuilly vertuous, some in the honourable and rich, some in the outward grace and pleasures of the bodie) the sanctified person onely be bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed: we ought, in case we desire to be happie, to reforme our iudgement herein, and betake our selues to a course of pietie. For so we are to apprehend of the Prophets inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this Psalme, as if in direct tearmes he reasoned with vs thus:

                        <item>
                           <hi>If the godly man only be blessed, then in case we desire to be blessed, we ought to betake ourselues to a course of pietie.</hi>

                  <p>The <hi>Assumption</hi> or second sentence is the question and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect of this whole first Psalme.</p>

                  <p>Now before the Psalmist disputes the said question by force of argument, he describeth vnto vs this godly man by his cariage: the parts whereof are two:
<list>

The prophane and sinfull actions, which the godly man forbeareth, are of three degrees: into which they are distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished by their efficients and authors, thus:
<list>
                        <item>
                           <hi>1.</hi> To deliberate and resolue in heart vpon the committing of sinne at the perswasion of others, as the wicked doth. This action, with the efficient thereof, is expressed by this phrase of walking in, or according to the counsell of the wicked.</item>
                        <item>
                           <hi>2.</hi> After resolution taken of sinning, to hold a constant course therein in the traine of our life, as the sinner doth. This action, with the author thereof, is noted by our stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in the way of the sinner.</item>
                        <item>
                           <hi>3.</hi> Out of an habit of sinning in heart and in the course of life, to make open profession of impietie, and as it were to reade a Lecture thereof, as the Mocker doth. This ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with the committer thereof, is signified by sitting in the seate of the Mocker.</item>
                     </list>
The actions of pietie, wherein the godly man imployeth himselfe, are, by naming a part for the whole, implied to be all the actions and duties of obedience required at our hands. Onely two of them are here specified: namely,
<list>
                        <item>1. <hi>Taking delight in the Law of God,</hi> vers. 2. in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning.</item>
                        <item>2. <hi>Meditating in the same Law day and night,</hi> vers. 2. in the end.</item>
                     </list>
Hauing thus described the person, who is the subiect and seate of blessednesse, he proceedeth to cleare the question in hand by light of argument, thus:
<list>
                        <pb n="4" facs="tcp:18936:10"/>
                        <item>With whom it succeedeth prosperously in this and the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture life, he is blessed.</item>
                        <item>With the godly man onely it succeedeth prosperously in this and the future life.</item>
                        <item>Therefore the godly man only is blessed.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Proposition</hi> is omitted, as a knowne and cleare descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a blessed man.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Assumption</hi> is vers. 3. in the end. That the words in the end of the said third verse carrie the sense comprised in the <hi>Assumption,</hi> may appeare by conference of them with the 4. and 5. verse. In which verses the wicked (whose state by way of illustrating the state of the godly is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared by the Prophet) are made as chaffe and vncapable of an happy and prosperous condition in this and the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture life. So as if the Prophet would notifie vnto vs the nature of the condition allotted to the godly, by setting downe the difference and vnlikenes which the state of the wicked hath therewith: then if he shew that the state of the wicked is vnprosperous and wretched in either life: we are proportionably to conceiue that he would thereby make it knowne, that it succeedeth prosperously with the godly in either life.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Conclusion</hi> is vers. 1. and 2.</p>
                  <p>Of the said <hi>Assumption</hi> the Prophet yeeldeth vs an illustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, first from comparisons: and then from the efficient cause of the said prosperous successe. Of the comparisons the one is a Similitude or a comparison of things like; the other a Dissimilitude or a comparison of things vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like betwixt themselues.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Similitude</hi> vsed by the Prophet is this:
<list>
                        <item>As a tree, which being planted by the riuers of waters, yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth her fruite in due season and withereth not in her leafe, alwaies in her kind prospereth, <hi>vers. 3.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>So the godly man, whose pietie is fruitfull and neuer withe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, doth alwaies prosper, <hi>vers. 3.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Dissimilitude</hi> is this:
<list>
                        <pb n="5" facs="tcp:18936:10"/>
                        <item>The condition of the wicked man is alwaies vnprosperous and wretched, <hi>vers. 4. in the beginning.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>But the state of the godly man is euer prosperous and flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing, <hi>vers. 3.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
The former part of this <hi>Dissimilitude</hi> is cleared vnto vs, thus:
<list>
                        <item>Who are liable to vtter reiection by the power of Gods wrath, their condition is alwaies vnprosperous and wretched.</item>
                        <item>But the wicked are such as are liable to vtter reiection by the power of Gods wrath.</item>
                        <item>Therefore the wicked are those whose condition is alwaies vnprosperous and wretched.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Proposition</hi> is omitted.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Assumption</hi> is folded and closed vp in a short compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, vers. 4. in the end: where it is said, that <hi>the wicked are as chaffe which the winde driueth away.</hi> This short compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison being vnfolded and distinguished into his parts, will represent vnto vs both the said Assumption and a declaration thereof by a Similitude, thus:
<list>
                        <item>As chaffe, a thing contemptible and of no vse, is readilie dispersed with euery blast of winde:</item>
                        <item>So the wicked being of no regard with the Lord and of no good vse in life, rest exposed to vtter reiection by the breath of the Lords wrath.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Conclusion,</hi> as it is vers. 4. in the beginning: so is it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated and expounded more at large, vers. 5. Where in expresse termes it is auouched, that (because the wicked are as chaffe, that is, subiect to vtter reiection from the face of the Lord) therefore they shall not stand in that iudgement, nor in the assemblie of the iust: that is to say, they shall not be partakers of the prosperous state allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the godly in this and the future life: but it shall succeede with them vnprosperously and miserably in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. By <hi>iudgement</hi> therefore I vnderstand the prosperous condition of the godly in this life, ensuing vpon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed and vpright cariage of all proceedings on the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:18936:11"/>
Lords part: and by <hi>the assemblie of the iust,</hi> their happie state in the future world.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto of the comparisons vsed for the discussing of this point, <hi>That with the godly it succeedeth prosperously in either life.</hi> The truth hereof is further manifested and inforced by noting vnto vs the efficient cause of this prosperous successe, thus:
<list>
                        <item>Whose way the Lord approoueth and liketh, with him it euer succeedeth prosperously.</item>
                        <item>But the godly man is he whose way the Lord approoueth and liketh, <hi>vers. 6. in the beginning.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>Therefore the godly man is he, with whom it euer suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth prosperously. <hi>vers. 3.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Assumption</hi> (namely, <hi>that the Lord approueth and liketh the way of the godly</hi>) is amplified by setting downe a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie action of the Lords, thus:
<list>
                        <item>
                           <hi>The Lord doth dislike and hate the way of the wicked,</hi> vers. 6. in the end. Whereas the Prophet saith, that <hi>the way of the wicked shall perish:</hi> we must vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand as meant thereby the efficient cause of this perishing, namely, the hatred conceiued by the Lord against the wicked.</item>
                        <item>
                           <hi>Therefore the Lord doth approoue and like the way of the godly man:</hi> that is, <hi>his person and holy cariage of life,</hi> vers. 6. in the beginning.</item>

                  <p>THis Psalme containes an exhortation to all estates and degrees of men both Prince and people, to forbeare plotting and attempting against the kingdome of Christ, and consequently to doe worship and homage vnto him. For what <hi>Dauid</hi> speakes here of himselfe, wee must take it spoken of him as he is a type and figure of Christ. And it is true that the tenne tribes of Israel with their Princes and Gouernours, that the Philistims also, the Ammonites and others warred against <hi>Dauid</hi> with intention to depriue him of the imperiall crowne and scepter, which he had receiued from the Lord: so is it true likewise that the Princes and people of the Iewes, the high Priests, Scribes and Pharisies together with <hi>Herod, Pilate,</hi> and their associates, conspired the ruine of Christ and his kingdome. Which conspiracie of theirs was vnder a type shadowed foorth and signified by the combination entred against <hi>Dauid</hi> and his temporall soueraigntie.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="8" facs="tcp:18936:12"/>The <hi>Question</hi> then deduced in this Psalme is this:
<list>
                        <item>That both Prince and people should renounce their former proceedings against Christ, and so, as becommeth loyall subiects, do worship and homage vnto him, <hi>vers. 10.11.12.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>AS I take this to be the question handled here by the Prophet: so I apprehend the sense of those three ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, wherein the said question is contained, to be such as I haue set downe. First, in the tenth verse the Prophet doth vnder generall termes of <hi>being wise and learned,</hi> aduise both Prince and people to be informed of the Lords pleasure in this particular of <hi>forbearing all deseignes and practises against Christ.</hi> Then verse 11. he exhorts them to doe worship vnto him, setting downe the manner and forme how this wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship is to be performed, namely, <hi>with all reuerence and with a full ioy of heart, accompanied with a speciall humbling and trembling at the consideration of Christs Maiestie and their former rebellions.</hi> Thirdly, in the 12. verse he moues them to the doing of homage vnto Christ: where by <hi>kissing the Son,</hi> (namely, the eternall Sonne of God mentioned in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth verse) is noted the publike acknowledgement and profession which both Prince and people are to make of their <hi>subiection</hi> vnto Christ. Amongst the ancients a kisse tendered by an inferiour to a superiour, was a signe and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonie that the inferiour publikely acknowledged and professed the other to be his Lord. So as it is required at the hands of all Potentates and their subiects, that they should not onely present in priuate <hi>a spirituall worship vnto Christ, but also publikely professe their alleageance vnto him, and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the royall authoritie and lawes of his kingdome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now to perswade both Prince and people to this dutie and conformitie, the Prophet vseth three seuerall argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: the first whereof is this:
<list>
                        <pb n="9" facs="tcp:18936:12"/>
                        <head>Arg. 1.</head>
                        <item>If your proceedings against Christ will prooue vaine and succeslesse, forbeare them, doing worship and homage vnto Christ.</item>
                        <item>But your proceedings against Christ will proue vaine and succeslesse, <hi>vers. 1. &amp; 2. Both these verses car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie this sense,</hi> that their mutining, their plots and endeuours against Christ will not take effect.</item>
                        <item>Therefore forbeare your proceedings against Christ, doing worship &amp; homage vnto him. <hi>ver. 10.11.12</hi>

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:18936:13"/>
termes of <hi>breaking their bands and cords,</hi> we are to vnderstand the endeuours and attempts of the said Princes and people to supplant the gouernment and lawes, whereby the kingdome of Christ is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered and managed. Now this end, which these mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinous leaguers propound vnto themselues, is am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plified by imparting with vs the action of their mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall incouraging themselues to a resolute and spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die compassing thereof.

In the fourth verse it is said, that <hi>the Lord will laugh and mocke at them,</hi> that is, make no reckoning of them, in regard of any possibilitie in them to preuaile. In the fift verse is set downe the Lords purpose to frustrate and disappoint them: which purpose is implied vnder the termes of spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vnto them in his wrath: and more cleerely sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified in the words following, of confounding them in the heate of his displeasure.</item>

                           <hi>The second part of the said decree concernes the kingdome giuen vnto Christ,</hi> vers. 8. <hi>Where this kingdome is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed vnto vs:</hi>

                  <p>It being now apparant that the Lord hath annoynted Christ King ouer his people: the Prophet returnes to the pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of his generall exhortation by a third argument, thus:

                           <hi>By opposing against Christ you shall suddenly perish,</hi> vers. 12.

                  <p>THe title of this Psalme, namely, <hi>Mictam of Dauid,</hi> is by the Prophet premised thereto, partly to aduertise vs who is the author and inditer thereof, and partly to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend vnto vs the excellencie of the Psalme, it being such as containes a doctrine more to be valued than a iewell of the purest gold.</p>
                  <p>There are of this Psalme two parts:
<list>
                        <item>1. <hi>The one an effectuall request vnto God:</hi> in the foure first verses.</item>
                        <item>2. <hi>The other a thankesguing:</hi> in the rest of the verses fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The request is this:
<list>
                        <item>That the Prophet might be preserued in the whole traine of his life.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>To induce the Lord to yeeld hereto, the Prophet vseth three arguments. The first is concluded thus:
<list>
                        <head>Arg. 1.</head>
                        <item>Who trust and rest vpon thee, let them be preserued by thee.</item>
                        <item>I am one who doth trust and rest vpon thee, <hi>vers. 1. in the end.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>Therefore let me be preserued by thee, O Lord, <hi>ver. 1. in the beginning.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Proposition</hi> though it be omitted, yet must we conceiue of it as the ground and foundation of this motion made by the Prophet. For it doth remember vnto the Lord his gratious promise and the condition thereof: which is a precedent acting of this dutie of resting vpon the Lord, required by him.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Assumption</hi> doth tender vnto the Lord a reall accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment on the Prophets part of the said condition: he
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:18936:16"/>
hauing acted that which the Lord requireth, which is a confident reposing on him.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Conclusion</hi> out of a regard to the condition thus ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished, doth challenge at the Lords hands an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall and readie performance of the said promise.</p>
                  <p>The second argument, whereby <hi>Dauid</hi> doth solicite Gods preseruation of him, is this:
<list>
                        <head>Arg. 2.</head>
                        <item>
                           <hi>If thou be my soueraigne Lord, and I thy seruant, let me be preserued by thee.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>
                           <hi>But thou art my soueraigne Lord, and I thy seruant,</hi> vers. 2. Albeit the Prophet doth not in distinct termes set downe that he is the Lords seruant: yet, forasmuch as his acknowledging God to be his Lord, doth necessarily implie that he is the Lords seruant, we are to conceiue it as set downe.</item>
                        <item>
                           <hi>Therfore let me, O Lord, be preserued by thee,</hi> vers. 1.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Assumption</hi> hath an illustration from the testimonie of his soule and conscience, vers. 2. in the beginning: where the speech addressed to his soule carrieth this sense:
<list>
                        <item>Thou, O my soule, doest auouch and professe that the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall is my Lord and Master. And therefore I doe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge him for my soueraigne Lord, and my selfe for his seruant.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third argument, wherewith hee would perswade the Lord to preserue him, is drawne from the consideration of the end of his preseruation, and is this:
<list>
                        <head>Arg. 3.</head>
                        <item>If vpon thy preseruation of me, I shall be readie to doe good vnto thy deare children: let me, O Lord, be preserued by thee.</item>
                        <item>But vpon thy preseruation of me I shall be readie to doe good vnto thy deare children, <hi>vers. 3. Where the Prophet maketh profession of extending his well doing to the Saints and the excellent of the earth: that is, to Gods children.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>Therfore let me, O Lord, be preserued by thee, <hi>vers. 1.</hi>

                  <p>The motiue inducing the Prophet to the doing of good vnto the Lords deare children, is this:

                  <p>Touching the <hi>Assumption:</hi> the delight and loue therein mentioned, he doth notifie vnto vs by drawing into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration the contrarie affection he beareth vnto such as are the opposites of Gods children, namely, the Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and wicked of the world. He concludeth thus:

                  </p>
                  <p>The former part of this conclusion touching <hi>Idolaters,</hi> and the Prophets <hi>detestation of them,</hi> is set out vnto vs:
<list>
                        <item>1. <hi>By a description of Idolaters,</hi> vers. 4. in the begin.</item>
                        <item>2. <hi>By two actions of the Prophets, whereby he discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth and professeth his hatred of them,</hi> vers. 4. in the other part of the verse.</item>

                  <p>The description of <hi>Idolaters,</hi>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. <hi>Is from a comparison: wherein they are resembled to men who marrie wiues and conferre dowries vpon them.</hi> For so Idolaters doe in the inward worship and deuotion of their hearts, as it were marrie themselues to Idols, and endow them with their goods: as may appeare in that at their great charge they erect Churches, Altars, and Images vnto them, and withall do honour them with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie daies, solemne feasts, and oblations of worth.</item>
                        <item>2. <hi>It is from the effect and issue which followeth vpon this course held by Idolaters.</hi> For thereby they mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplie anguish and troubles vnto themselues: that is, they draw vpon themselues by the iustice of God, both inward and outward calamities and vexations: as appeareth by Deut. 31. vers. 16.17.</item>

                  <p>
                     <pb n="19" facs="tcp:18936:17"/>The actions of the Prophet whereby he discloseth and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth his detestation of the said Idolaters, are these:
<list>
                        <item>1. <hi>His renouncing all communication with them in their sacrifices.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>2. <hi>His protesting against all future mention of their names in his mouth.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hitherto of the Prophets request for preseruation. His thanksgiuing followeth from the beginning of the fifth verse to the end of the Psalme: so as the subiect handled in these verses, is this:
<list>
                        <item>I will magnifie the Lord with my heart and tongue, <hi>vers. 7. and 9.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the 7. verse he professeth that he <hi>will praise the Lord:</hi> and this he repeateth vers. 9. though in other termes: for hee saith; <hi>Wherefore my heart is glad, and my tongue reioyceth: and my flesh doth rest securely:</hi> that is, <hi>My whole person hath cause of speciall reioycing and comfort in regard of the Lords blessings bestowed on me.</hi> What is said in either of these verses hath reference to the benefits as well recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded after them, as mentioned before them. And the 9. verse may aptly serue to interpret more at large the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of magnifying the Lord in the 7. verse.</p>
                  <p>Now let vs see vpon what inducement the Prophets profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of magnifying the Lord is grounded. The induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is this:
<list>
                        <item>
                           <hi>The Eternall hath bestowed sundrie benefits vpon me,</hi> vers. 5.6.7.8.10.11. In these verses the Prophet doth particulate the seuerall benefits he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued from the Lord.</item>
                        <item>
                           <hi>Therfore will I magnifie him with my heart and tongue,</hi> vers. 7. and 9.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The former part of this reason is not set downe in these ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse and formall termes, but necessarily collected from the enumeration of the benefits conferred vpon the Prophet. The benefits are propounded,
<list>
                        <item>1. <hi>First in generall.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>2. <hi>Then in particular.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="20" facs="tcp:18936:18"/>The benefits in generall are mentioned vers. 5. and 6: where vnder rhetoricall and borrowed formes of speech, hee shewes that <hi>the Lord onely, and none other, is vnto him ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute and perfit happinesse:</hi> whether we respect
<list>
                        <item>1. <hi>The giuing of the said happinesse: which he doth sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificantly implie, by glorying that the Lord is the portion of his inheritance and of his cup: that is, the author and supplier vnto him of all comfort and bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sednes both for this and the future life,</hi> vers. 5. in the beginning.</item>
                        <item>2. <hi>The preseruing thereof being giuen vnto him. For vers.</hi> 5. <hi>in the end, he honoureth God for the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and support of his lot: that is, the state of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse allotted vnto him.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>3. <hi>The pleasure accompanying the same, vers.</hi> 6. <hi>Where he likewise glorieth, that the lines are fallen vnto him in pleasant places: and that he hath a faire and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly heritage. By lines and the heritage he speaketh of, he meaneth the estate of happinesse, which by the free mercie of God is befallen vnto him: and that it is in pleasant places and most faire. Whereby hee noteth the pleasure accompanying the said estate. The name of lot and lines seemeth to be taken by the Prophet from the ancient manner of surueying and diuiding lands and inheritances: as wee finde obserued and practised by</hi> Iosua <hi>in the diuision of Canaan a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Israelites.</hi>
                        </item>

                  </p>
                  <p>The benefits propounded in particular, are comprised by him in the verses following: in which he magnifieth the Lord,
<list>
                        <item>1. <hi>For the sanctification of his heart.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>2. <hi>For two future benefits, namely, his resurrection, and life eternall.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>His <hi>Sanctification</hi> he declareth by noting vnto vs the parts thereof: which are these:
<list>
                        <pb n="21" facs="tcp:18936:18"/>
                        <item>1. <hi>The illumination of his vnderstanding,</hi> vers. 7. in the beginning. Where he shewes that the Lord aduiseth and counselleth him: that is, inlighteneth and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formeth his vnderstanding by his holy Spirit.</item>
                        <item>2. <hi>Direction of his thoughts and affections,</hi> vers. 7. in the end. Where he shewes that his reines instruct him: that is, his will and affections are ordered and gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Lord in the choise of the way he ought to hold. This part of sanctification is set foorth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, by noting the time when it is performed, namely, in the nights: that is, alwaies both night and day. For by one part of time hee meaneth and signifieth the whole time of his life.</item>
                        <item>3. <hi>Perseuerance in faith and dependance on God,</hi> vers. 8. Where he saith, that he euer sets the Lord before his eyes: that is, hee doth euer by faith rest vpon the Lord. And hereupon he deduceth in the same verse this most comfortable conclusion:
<list>
                              <item>
                                 <hi>I doe by faith euer rest vpon the Lord for his help,</hi> vers. 8. in the midst. Where by saying thus; <hi>Sith the Lord is at my right hand,</hi> he doth aduertise vs that with the eye of his faith he euer beholdeth the Lord readie to helpe him: which is in effect as if he should say: I doe euer by faith looke vnto God, and rest on him for helpe.</item>
                              <item>
                                 <hi>Therefore shall I euer stand in the fauour of the Lord, and neuer so be shaken as to fall from it,</hi> vers. 8. in the end.</item>

                  </p>
                  <p>Hauing honoured God for his Sanctification, he procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to a further glorifying of him for the said future be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits:
<list>
                        <item>1. <hi>Of his resurrection.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>2. <hi>Of the eternall life.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Of his <hi>Resurrection</hi> he speaketh vers. 10. thus: <hi>Thou wilt not leaue my soule in the graue</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (meaning by <hi>soule</hi> the subiect or place wherein his soule resideth, which is his body) <hi>nor
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:18936:19"/>
suffer thy welbeloued to see corruption.</hi> This is first and principally to be vnderstood of Christ, as it is at large ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded in the 2. of the Acts, vers. 25. &amp;c. for Christs bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, though for some time it remained in the graue, yet neuer was corrupted in any part thereof, but rose a most sound and perfit bodie. Whereas the bodie of <hi>Dauid</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer yet rose from the graue, but was in the same reduced to putrifaction and dust. But secondarily this is to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood of <hi>Dauid,</hi> and likewise of all others the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Christ: who in regard of the strict vnion betwixt the head and the members, must of necessitie participate in the resurrection of the head Christ Iesus.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The blessing of eternall life</hi> is mentioned vers. 11: where the Prophet honoreth the Lord for the same in these words: <hi>Thou wilt make me know the path of life:</hi> that is, After thou hast raised my bodie from the graue, I shall then really and in mine owne experience enter both bodie and soule together into the path and enioyance of life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall. Touching this blessing of eternall life, the Prophet doth set foorth and recommend vnto vs the worthinesse and excellencie thereof, in that it is accompanied

                  <p>The <hi>Subiect</hi> of this Psalme is an humble sute presented by the Prophet vnto the Lord, namely:
<list>
                        <item>That the Lord would be pleased to deliuer him from his enemies, <hi>vers. 7.9.11.12.</hi>

                  <p>The Prophets sute is first set downe, ver. 7: and then repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, vers. 9.11. and 12. Whereas he saith, <hi>Heare me and

haue mercie on me,</hi> vers. 7. Again, <hi>Hide not thy face from me, and forsake not thy seruant,</hi> vers. 9. Againe, <hi>Teach me thy way, and guide me through the right path,</hi> vers. 11. Againe, <hi>Deliuer me not to my enemies,</hi> vers. 12. All these speeches, which he hath in this varietie of termes expressed, carrie this interpretation and sense: <hi>Abandon me not, O Lord, to mine enemies, but deliuer me from them.</hi> The hearing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired, vers. 7. is an hearing to deliuerance: and the mercie to be shewed, is mercie in the act of deliuerance. So verse 9. Gods not hiding his face from the Prophet, and his not forsaking him, is Gods fauourable countenance towards him and readines for his deliuerance. So vers. 11. the way he would be taught, and the right path he would be gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded through, is the way and path of his deliuerance: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther must we conceiue that he desires a bare knowledge of this way, but an actuall setting of him in the path of preseruation and libertie. So vers. 12. not to be deliuered to the appetite of his enemies: what doth it import but a motion for his deliuerance from them?</p>
                  <p>Now to perswade the Lord to a gracious regard of his sute for deliuerance from his enemies: first he maketh profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of his secure dependance vpon him in the sixe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer verses of the Psalme: And then in the verses follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vnto the 13. he soliciteth the grant of his said sute by sundrie other arguments.</p>

                  <p>Hitherto hath the Prophet insisted vpon the profession of his secure reposing vpon the Lord: to the end he might perswade and induce him to yeeld vnto his humble sute for deliuerance from his enemies.

                  <p>The Prophet hauing hitherto with so many important mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues accompanied his humble petition vnto the Lord for deliuerance: hee doth in the two last verses of the Psalme (out of an assured perswasion to preuaile with the Lord) encourage himselfe to rest confidently vpon him: and so returneth to a further inlargement of the first ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument alleaged by him to perswade his deliuerance.

                        <item>If my confident perswasion touching the accomplishment of the Lords promised blessing towards me before my death, hath hitherto supported and intertained me in breath and life: then ought I still to depend securely on the Lord.</item>

                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Assumption</hi> is set downe vers. 13. in these termes: <hi>I should haue fainted, except I had beleeued that I should see the goodnes of the Lord in the land of the liuing.</hi> Where by the goodnesse of the Lord, he meaneth his deliuerance from trouble, and the enioying of a successor to his Crowne out of his owne loynes.

                  <p>The <hi>Conclusion</hi> (as hath been noted) is vers. 14: where it is further inforced to improoue and aduance his depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance vpon the Lord, by shewing what effect it worketh on Gods part:

Where for a further manifesting of the truth of this sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, he specifieth the instruments vsed by the Lord in working the deliuerance of his children. These instruments are the Angels: by whose ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of incamping about vs, he doth implie and signifie all other seruices done by them in fauour of Gods children.</item>
                        <item>
                           <hi>But I Dauid called on the Lord out of an heart fearing him,</hi> vers. 5. and 7. In the 5. verse he saith: <hi>I sought the Lord,</hi> namely, <hi>out of an heart fearing him.</hi> In the seuenth verse, changing the person (which is a forme vsuall in Scripture) hee repeateth his seeking and calling vnto the Lord vnder these termes: <hi>This poore man cried vnto the Lord:</hi> that is, <hi>I Dauid who was in a poore and distressed case, cried vnto the Lord for help against the perill where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I was.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>The effect growing from the obseruation of the Lords mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie in the deliuerance of <hi>Dauid,</hi> is, <hi>The recourse that others shall make vnto the Lord by humble petition in the day of their trouble,</hi> vers. 6. where he saith: <hi>They shall looke vnto the Lord and flock vnto him:</hi> that is, They obseruing how mercifully the Lord hath proceeded with me in deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring me from the danger of death, shall thereupon bee moued in the day of trouble, as it were to runne vnto
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:18936:26"/>
the Lord for help by way of supplication. Now this their recourse vnto the Lord by way of humble petition, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended vnto vs by noting the blessed issue follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereupon. The issue is, that vpon such their recourse vnto the Lord for helpe, <hi>their faces shall not be ashamed:</hi> that is, they shall find fauour in the Lords sight for grant of their requests.</p>
                  <p>The Prophet hauing thus exhorted others to a concurrence with him in magnifying the Lord: he now perswadeth them to a performance of two other duties:

                        <item>1. <hi>The one of meditating on the goodnes of the Lord, to the end they may repose vpon him,</hi> vers. 9.</item>

                  </p>
                  <p>The former dutie is recommended and pressed by this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument:

                           <hi>If they be blessed who trust in the Lord: then ought we to meditate on his goodnes, that we may thereupon be moued to trust in him.</hi>

Where by tasting and seeing how gratious the Lord is, wee must take to bee meant not a bare knowledge of the Lords goodnes, but a serious meditation accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying the same, and such as may perswade our hearts to a confident dependance on him. Which point of dependance and trust in the Lord, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer it be not mentioned in the first part of this 9. verse, which presenteth vnto vs the exhortation of meditating on the goodnes of the Lord: yet must we conceiue it to be there in effect &amp; sense: as if the Prophet had said, Taste and see how gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious the Lord is, that thereupon you may bee drawne to trust in him.

                  <p>Now in the 12. verse, the Prophet by way of preuention of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth to satisfie a question that may be demanded tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching this feare, namely: <hi>What this feare is, whereto the Prophet perswadeth, and which is accompanied with the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines spoken of in the</hi> 10. and 11. verse. Before he resolue this question: he doth (because the matter is of moment, and draweth with it an happie life) solicite his auditors to an attentiue hearing of him:
<list>
                        <item>1. <hi>By an argument drawne from a circumstance of their persons: in that he calleth them by the sweete title of Sonnes: a title which the Prophets bestowed vpon their disciples, to testifie their speciall loue and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes vnto them,</hi> vers. 12. in the beginning.</item>
                        <item>2. <hi>By noting vnto them the worthines of the subiect, in the knowledge wherof he would informe them: which is, the feare of the Lord,</hi> vers. 12. in the end.</item>
                        <item>3. <hi>By remembring vnto them, the desire that is in euerie

of them of an happie life,</hi> vers. 13. Where by way of an interrogation hee aduertiseth them that this desire of enioying happines is in euery man. For the Prophet demaunding this question, <hi>(What man is he that desireth life?)</hi> doth in effect and sense speake thus: Sure I am that there is no man who doth not affect and desire an happie life.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>These motiues, whereby hee induceth his auditors to an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiue and carefull hearing of him, are concluded thus:
<list>
                        <item>You are my disciples whom I loue as my sonnes: the point of doctrine, wherein I will informe you, concernes the feare of the eternall God: and euery of you desires the happines which doth accompanie this feare, <hi>vers. 12. and 13.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>Hearken therefore vnto me, who am readie to instruct you in this point of doctrine, <hi>vers. 12. in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Hauing solicited his disciples to this attention in hearing him, hee proceedes to resolue them what this feare is, whereto he exhorteth them. To performe this, he setteth downe the particulars, wherein this feare of the Lord consisteth. He sheweth that it consisteth,

                        <item>2. <hi>In forbearance of sinfull actions, and in doing of that which is iust and good before God and man,</hi> vers. 15. Where in the end of the verse, that generall of doing good, is declared by mentioning two spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall actions that are to be done: whereof

                  <p>Now to raise vp in his said disciples a care to practise the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue mentioned particulars of obedience to the law of the Lord, the Prophet presseth them with an argument
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:18936:28"/>
taken from the consideration of the Lords gratious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding towards those who in the cariage of their life do labour to put in practise the said particulars. The argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment perswading hereto, is this:
<list>
                        <item>If to such as practise the said particulars of obedience to the law of the Lord, the Lord ministreth a continuall supplie of his gratious fauours: then ought you to practise the said particulars of obedience to the law of the Lord.</item>
                        <item>But to such as practise the said particulars of obedience to the law of the Lord, the Lord ministreth a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall supplie of his gratious fauours, <hi>vers. 16. Where the Prophet by particulating these two actions of the Lord, namely,</hi> His beholding of the righteous with the eye of his prouidence for their protection: <hi>and,</hi> His hearing of their crie with the eare of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseration for their deliuerance from trouble: <hi>the Prophet (I say) vnder the name of these two spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall actions, doth implie and signifie the Lords gratious proceeding in euery respect with the righteous, that is, with such as performe obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to his law.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>Therefore ought you to practise the said particulars of obedience to the law of the Lord, <hi>vers. 14. and 15.</hi>

The illustration, wherein the Lords fauourable course with the righteous is set foorth by his different procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with the wicked, is this:

                        <item>The Lord doth execute his wrath vpon the wicked, <hi>vers. 17. and 22.</hi>
                        </item>

                        <item>
                           <hi>The one is, the Lords rooting from out the earth the memorie of the wicked,</hi> vers. 17. which is an euident execution of his wrath vpon them.</item>
                        <item>
                           <hi>The other is, the Lords ordering of the wicked to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments of their owne destruction,</hi> vers. 22. which is another reall and apparant execution of his iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice vpon them.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The second sentence of the said illustration, to the end we may rest assured of the Lords fauour, and euer depend vpon him, is in varietie of termes expounded and itera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in so many verses, as I haue quoted: in each of which verses the Lords action of protecting or deliuering is mentioned.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>In the <hi>16.</hi> verse, both actions are noted, as hath been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared.</item>
                     <item>In the <hi>18.</hi> verse, his action of deliuerance is signified by his gratious hearing and deliuering of them out of distresse.</item>
                     <item>In the <hi>19.</hi> verse, his action of deliuerance is not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded, but improoued also and magnified by noting the extremitie of the distresse, from which the godly are deliuered. For it is said in this verse to this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: That the Lord is neere vnto the godly, and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth them euen then, when they faint and are as it were at the last gaspe through the greatnes of their affliction.</item>
                     <item>In the <hi>20.</hi> verse, his action of deliuerance is specified and recommended by aduertising vs that the number of the troubles, out of which the iust is deliuered, is great. Which argueth the greatnes of the mercie and power of the Deliuerer.</item>
                     <item>In the <hi>21.</hi> verse, his action of protection is remembred: it being there said, That the Lord hath that care of preseruing the iust, that he cannot receiue hurt in

any one bone without his prouidence and will.</item>
                     <item>In the <hi>23.</hi> verse, his action of deliuerance is comprised both in the beginning and end of the said verse. In this verse the godly are described:

                  </p>
                  <p>The first branch is vers. 1.7. and 8.</p>
                  <p>The second and third branch are ioyntly and cleerely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised, vers. 3. in the beginning, and vers. 34. in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. It is said, vers. 3. <hi>Trust in the Lord and doe good.</hi> So is it said, vers. 34. <hi>Waite on the Lord and keepe his way.</hi> In which verses, by <hi>doing good,</hi> and by <hi>keeping the Lords way,</hi> is meant an obedient and holy walking before him.</p>
                  <p>All three branches are in the 4. verse, though somewhat ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurely, noted vnder this forme of speech: <hi>Delight thy selfe in the Lord.</hi> Whereby is meant, that we should with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out grieuing at the Lords proceedings rest satisfied with his good pleasure declared by them, and so conforme our will to his will by depending on him, and by plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing him in the traine of our life. To doe this, is to take delight and contentment in the Lord.</p>
                  <p>In some other verses one of the said branches onely is spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified: as,
<list>
                        <item>
                           <hi>Vers. 5. and 7.</hi> Our resting on the Lord is mentioned.</item>
                        <item>
                           <hi>Vers. 27.</hi> Our walking obediently before him is remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>But forasmuch as these branches are in other verses ioyned together, and made the principall and maine scope of the Prophets dispute in this Psalme: we must, where we finde them seuered, conceiue notwithstanding that by noting one part, the other parts are implied and signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</p>
                  <p>Now the demonstration of the said question, comprising in generall whatsoeuer is in this Psalme deduced by the Prophet, is this:
<list>
                        <pb n="46" facs="tcp:18936:31"/>
                        <item>If the Lord proceede with the wicked to their ruine, and with the godly to their good: then ought the godly without grieuing at the wicked to rest on the Lord, and to walke obediently before him.</item>
                        <item>But the Lord proceedeth with the wicked to their ruine, and with the godly to their good.</item>
                        <item>Therefore ought the godly without grieuing at the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, to rest vpon the Lord, and to walke obediently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Proposition</hi> is omitted: but being thus supplied, it will the better informe our iudgement in discerning and waighing the conclusion.</p>
                  <p>Of the <hi>Assumption</hi> there be two parts: namely,
<list>
                        <item>
                           <hi>The Lords proceeding with the wicked to their ruine.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>
                           <hi>The Lords proceeding with the godly to their good.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The first part of the <hi>Assumption</hi> concerning the Lords pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding with the wicked to their ruine, is declared in the second verse, by obseruing the circumstance of the short time that they are to florish:
<list>
                        <item>The wicked shall <hi>(saith the Psalmist)</hi> be quickly cut down.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>This their short florishing and speedie fall is made euident vnto vs, by comparing it to the speedie withering of grasse, and any other greene herbe. The comparison is this:
<list>
                        <item>As grasse and any other greene herbe doth quickly wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and vanish:</item>
                        <item>So shall the wicked speedily fall &amp; be reduced to nought.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>This part of the said <hi>Assumption</hi> touching the ruine of the wicked, is repeated vers. 9: and the circumstance of the short time allotted to their florishing, rementioned v. 10.</p>
                  <p>The second part of the said <hi>Assumption,</hi> which concernes the Lords proceeding with the godly to their good, is not in these generall termes deliuered by the Prophet, but may sensibly be collected from the consideration of the particular blessings, which the Prophet hath sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in sundrie parts of this Psalme, to the end he might
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:18936:31"/>
by shewing how gratious the Lord is towards his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, thereby induce them to a dependance on him, and to a course of pietie in their life. Let vs see then what these particulars are, and how by them he disputeth this question <hi>of resting vpon the Lord, and walking obediently before him, without grieuing at the prosperitie of the wicked.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His first argument for the perswading hereof is this:
<list>
                        <head>Arg. 1.</head>
                        <item>Thou shalt by thy dependance on the Lord, and by walking obediently before him, enioy for a long time a safe and comfortable estate of life, <hi>vers. 3. And repeated vers. 9. &amp; 11. And vers. 27. &amp; 34.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>Therefore rest vpon the Lord, and walke obediently before him, <hi>vers. 3. Also vers. 27. and 34.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The former part of this reason is deliuered in the third verse vnder these words: <hi>Inhabite thou,</hi> or, <hi>Thou shalt inhabite the earth and be fed assuredly.</hi> And in the 9. and the 11. verse vnder these termes: <hi>They shall by inheritance possesse the earth.</hi> Hereby is promised vnto the godly man that he shall be preserued on the earth a long time, and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with the comforts of this life, as being by the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious ordinance and fauour of God in Christ, the right owner and Lord of the earth.</p>
                  <p>Further, this reposing on the Lord and this sanctified ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of life, is solicited by the Prophet in this sort:
<list>
                        <head>Arg. 2.</head>
                        <item>Thou shalt by this religious course of life obtaine at the hands of the Lord the requests of thine heart, <hi>vers. 4. in the end.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>Wherefore rest on the Lord, and liue obediently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, <hi>vers. 4. in the beginning. That this is the interpretation and sense of these words:</hi> Delight in the Lord: <hi>is shewed before.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>His perswasion to the said dependance and holines of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation, is in the 5. verse framed and tendered after this forme:
<list>
                        <head>Arg. 3.</head>
                        <item>By this course of dependance on the Lord and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of life, it shall succeede well with thee in all thy affaires, <hi>vers. 5. in the end. Where it is said:</hi> The
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:18936:32"/>
Lord shall bring it to passe: <hi>that is,</hi> Blesse and prosper thee in thy proceedings.</item>
                        <item>Rest therefore on the Lord, and walke obediently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, <hi>vers. 5. in the beginning: where vnder the name of one part of the question, both parts of it are to be vnderstood.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The former sentence of this perswasion being such as may be excepted vnto, the Prophet doth in the 6. verse pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent and satisfie the exception that may be taken against it. The exception is not in distinct termes expressed, but by the answere thereto we may conceiue it to be this:
<list>
                        <item>The life of the godly man doth rest exposed to sundrie calumnies and oppressions.</item>
                        <item>Therefore it succeedeth not well with him in all his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Prophets answere to this exception is such, as if hee should directly say: <hi>That, howsoeuer the godly man is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to calumnies and oppressions, yet it followeth not, that therefore it succeedeth ill with him in his particular.</hi> This deniall of the sequell presented in the said exception, as if it were expresly set downe (as it is out of congruitie to be vnderstood) the Prophet doth iustifie by acquainting vs with the Lords proceeding in this case on the behalfe of the godly. For he giues vs to vnderstand in the 6. verse, <hi>That howsoeuer the innocencie of the godly be at sometime couered as it were with a thicke and darke mist of slander and oppression, yet the Lord will in his good time scatter and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solue this mist, and so make the innocencie of the godly appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and cleere to the world.</hi> For thus saith the Prophet touching this point:
<list>
                        <item>The Lord will bring foorth thy righteousnes: <hi>that is,</hi> make thy innocencie knowne to the world, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing any mist of slanders cast vpon it.</item>
                        <item>And therefore it followeth not, that in the case of slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous imputations laid vpon thee, it succeedeth ill with theee in thy affaires.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now the cleerenes which the Lord will set vpon the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:18936:32"/>
of the godly man, is notified vnto vs by a double comparison. For it is compared first in generall with the light of the Sunne: then in particular with the light of the Sunne at noone day. As if he said:
<list>
                        <item>The light of the Sunne is great: but the light and cleere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes which the Lord shall set vpon the innocencie of the godly man shall equall it: nay, which is more, it shall equall the brightnes of the Sunne at noone day.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>These verses following (<hi>viz.</hi> the 7.8.9.10.11.) doe repeate that which hath bin afore deliuered. In the 7. and 8. ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses the generall and maine question is contained. The first part of the 9. verse, with the whole tenth, pertaine to the first part of the generall <hi>Assumption,</hi> which concernes the Lords proceeding with the wicked to their ruine. And y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> second part of the 9. verse, together with the 11, do remember vnto vs that, which is propounded in the end of the third verse, as the first particular argument perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding dependance on the Lord, and a sanctified cariage of life.</p>
                  <p>Thus you see how the Prophet hath concluded the maine question by three particulars, importing the Lords gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious proceeding with the godly to their good. Before he proceede further: he incountreth and refelleth three obiections made against this fauourable proceeding held by the Lord towards his children.</p>
                  <p>The first obiection is vers. 12. thus:
<list>
                        <head>Obi. 1. v. 12.</head>
                        <item>The wicked are suffered by the Lord to plot and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise against the iust. <hi>This is declared by noting vnto vs the cause of this plotting, namely, their malice: which is implied and signified by that effect of</hi> gnashing their teeth.</item>
                        <item>Therefore it seemeth that the Lord proceedeth not so gratiously with the godlie, as hath been remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The answere to this obiection is vers. 13. by imparting with vs the frustration and dissuccesse of the sayd plotting, thus:
<list>
                        <pb n="50" facs="tcp:18936:33"/>
                        <head>Answer. v. 13.</head>
                        <item>
                           <hi>Their plotting against the iust is vaine and without successe,</hi> vers. 13. in the beginning. Where the Prophet ascribing vnto the Lord the action of laughing, doth thereby shew that the Lord holdeth such proiects and practises, at which he laugheth, for succeslesse and vaine. For, were they to take effect, it could not with any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity be said, that the Lord laugheth at them.</item>
                        <item>
                           <hi>Therefore the plotting of the wicked against the iust hindreth not, but that the Lord may be said to hold notwithstanding a gratious proceeding with</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                           <hi>iust.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The former part of this answere touching the miscariage and failing of the wicked in their plots and practises, is cleered by aduertising vnto vs the cause of the said fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling: which is, <hi>a determination on the part of the Lord, to dispatch the wicked ere they execute their designes.</hi> The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion is this:
<list>
                        <item>
                           <hi>The Lord doth by the eye of his prouidence direct to a reall issue his determined dispatch of the wicked, ere they execute their designe against the iust,</hi> vers. 13. in the end. Where it is said: <hi>The Lord seeth the day,</hi> that is, the appointed and decreed ruine of the wicked to be at hand. By the Lords seeing the approch hereof, we are to vnderstand not an idle beholding, but an actual directing to issue on the Lords part of the said determined dispatch and ruine of the wicked.</item>
                        <item>
                           <hi>Therefore the plotting of the wicked against the godly is vaine and without successe,</hi> vers. 13. in the begin.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The second obiection is vers. 14. thus:
<list>
                        <head>Obi. 2.</head>
                        <item>The wicked attempt the destruction of the godlie: which the Prophet signifieth by two particular ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of theirs: the one of drawing their sword: the other of bending their bow against the iust.</item>
                        <item>And therefore it may seeme that the Lord suffering this attempt against the godly, proceedeth not so gratiously with them, as hath been mentioned.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="51" facs="tcp:18936:33"/>The answere hereto is vers. 15: where the Prophet, though not in formall and expresse termes, yet in sense and effect denieth the sequell deduced in this obiection. For he telleth vs that howsoeuer the wicked attempt against the godly, yet his attempt is such as is not to be regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: it being in the issue thereof not only frustrated and disappointed, but of a fatall and pernitious consequence to the vtter ouerthrow of himselfe. As if the Prophet should frame his answere to the said obiection, thus:
<list>
                        <head>Answer. v. 15.</head>
                        <item>The attempts of the wicked are frustrated by the Lord, and made the meanes of their owne destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</item>
                        <item>Therefore notwithstanding their attempts suffered by the Lord, it may iustly be said that the Lord proceedeth gratiously with his children.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third obiection is not set downe, but preuented by an answere thereto in the 16. verse. The obiection is this:
<list>
                        <head>Obi. 3.</head>
                        <item>The godly hath little: whereas the wicked abound in wealth.</item>
                        <item>And therefore it seemeth that the Lord is not so gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious in his proceeding with the godly, as is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The answere to this third obiection is comprised in the 16. and 17. verse. The Prophet in the 16. verse tendreth this answere:
<list>
                        <head>Ans. v. 16 and 17</head>
                        <item>The little pittance which the Lord furnisheth vnto the godly man, is of great vse and comfort.</item>
                        <item>And therefore it cannot vpon any such regard as is noted in the obiection, be inferred, that the Lord proceedeth not gratiously with his children.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The former branch of this answere is cleered vnto vs,
<list>
                        <item>1. <hi>By comparing the little pittance of the godly with the wealth of the wicked, in the quantitie of the present vse and comfort yeelded by each of them,</hi> vers. 16.</item>
                        <item>2. <hi>By comparing the said little pittance with the wealth of the wicked, in the point of lasting and continuance incident to each of them,</hi> vers. 17.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="52" facs="tcp:18936:34"/>The first comparison is this:
<list>
                        <item>The wealth of all the wicked in the world heaped toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, may be of great comfort and vse to any one of the wicked:</item>
                        <item>But the little pittance furnished by the Lord vnto one godly man, is to the same man of farre greater vse and comfort.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The second comparison is this:
<list>
                        <item>
                           <hi>The wealth of the wicked doth vanish and perish,</hi> ver. 17. in the beginning: where the Prophet expresseth and deliuereth this sentence by saying, that the armes or strength of the wicked (which consisteth in their wealth) shall be broken.</item>

                           <hi>But the substance and reliefe of the godly doth last and remaine,</hi> v. 17. in the end. Where by these words: <hi>The Lord vpholdeth the iust:</hi> we are to vnderstand the supporting of the substance and intertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment allotted to the iust. For there being in this 17. verse a comparison, wherein things are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared in a different and vnlike qualitie: the ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie betwixt the first and latter part of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parision will not hold good without some such interpretation. The first part of the comparison doth touch the perishing not of the wicked mans person, but of his wealth. And therefore the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond part of the said comparison, must propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably concerne not the iust mans person, but his intertainment and substance. Besides, this 17. verse being an answere to an obiection, which importeth the substance and reliefe of the godlie to be very little: the sense of it cannot be sutable with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> obiection, vnlesse it be expounded as hath been said. This exposition is likewise confirmed by that which is deliuered in the 18. verse: where the Psalmist proueth that the possession of the iust remaineth for euer: that is, That the iust shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer faile of intertainment and reliefe.</item>

                  <p>
                     <pb n="53" facs="tcp:18936:34"/>The Prophet hauing in this sort answered the said third ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection, he doth thereupon take an occasion to dispute and determine this excellent and comfortable question: namely,
<list>
                        <item>That the Lord supplieth vnto the godly continuall reliefe and maintenance, <hi>vers. 17. &amp; 18.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The said question is set downe in the end of the 17. and 18. verses. In the 17. it is said, <hi>That the Lord supporteth the iust:</hi> that is, <hi>hath that regard to their substance and reliefe, as it neuer faileth them.</hi> In the 18. it is auouched that <hi>their possession lasteth for euer:</hi> that is, the Lord doth alwaies relieue and feede them.</p>
                  <p>Let vs now see how the Prophet doth handle and iustifie this his assertion. The first argument for the cleering thereof, is concluded thus:
<list>
                        <head>Arg. 1.</head>
                        <item>Of whom the Lord hath a speciall regard and care, to them their intertainment and reliefe neuer fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth.</item>
                        <item>But of the godly the Lord hath a speciall regard and care, <hi>vers. 18. in the beginning: where it is said:</hi> That the Lord knoweth the daies of the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right men: <hi>that is,</hi> The Lord is carefull that it succeede well with them.</item>
                        <item>Therefore to the godly their intertainment and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe neuer faileth, <hi>vers. 17.18.</hi>

                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The second proofe vsed by the Psalmist for the deciding of the question in hand, is a comparison of this nature:

                        </item>
                        <item>Therefore reliefe shall not faile vnto the godly at any time, <hi>vers. 17.18.</hi>

                        <item>1. <hi>The first serueth to distinguish betwixt that which in the time of famine befalleth vnto the godly, and that which happeneth not vnto them. The argument of distinction is this:</hi>

                        <item>2. <hi>By noting the cause and meanes whereby the godly are inabled to giue and to be helpfull vnto others, thus:</hi>
                           <list>
                              <pb n="55" facs="tcp:18936:35"/>

                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Assumption</hi> is amplified by a comparison of things dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent and vnlike amongst themselues, thus:
<list>
                        <item>The wicked being accursed of the Lord, shall be cut from the earth and the commodities of it, <hi>vers. 22. in the end.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>But the godly being blessed of the Lord, doe and shall pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse the earth with the commodities of it, as the right owners of the same, <hi>vers. 22. in the beginning.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hitherto the second argument, to proue, <hi>That the godly shall neuer want reliefe and intertainment,</hi> hath been handled. The third followeth vnder this forme:
<list>
                        <head>Arg. 3.</head>
                        <item>The Lord doth settle and fortifie the state of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, <hi>vers. 23. Where these words</hi> (The man with whose way the Lord is delighted) <hi>containe a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of a godly man.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>Therefore the godly cannot want reliefe and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, <hi>vers. 17.18.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>To the <hi>Antecedent</hi> of this third argument the Prophet hath added by way of anticipation, an answer to an obiection, which may be made against the said <hi>Antecedent.</hi> The ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection is this:
<list>
                        <item>The godly falleth from his condition.</item>
                        <item>How therefore can it be said that his condition standeth established and fortified by the Lord?</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The answere to this obiection is from a distinction of falles, vers. 24: where the Prophet distinguisheth betwixt falles, thus:
<list>
                        <pb n="56" facs="tcp:18936:36"/>
                        <item>The fall of the godly is not an vtter deiection, but a reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerable fall.</item>
                        <item>And therefore notwithstanding a fall of this kinde, it may truly be auouched that he is of a setled and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified estate and condition.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>This answere importing the fall of the godly to be recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, is amplified from the cause of this recouerie, thus:
<list>
                        <item>The Lord doth hold the godly from vtter deiection, and raiseth him from the fall wherein he is, <hi>vers. 24. in the end.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>Therefore when the godly falleth from his estate, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couers himselfe againe thereto, <hi>vers. 24. in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The fourth reason, whereby to cleere the question <hi>of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall reliefe and intertainment supplied to the godly man,</hi> is drawne from a testimonie of the Prophets particular ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience and obseruation: which is double: the one, of neuer seeing the godly man goe from doore to doore a begging, vers. 25: the other, of obseruing him to be help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vnto others, and blessed in his children, vers. 26. The conclusion grounded on these two particular obserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, is this:
<list>
                        <item>I haue not at any time seene the godly man, or any of his posteritie begge their bread from doore to doore: but I haue obserued him to be helpfull vnto others, and blessed in his children, <hi>vers. 25. and 26.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>Whereupon I may reasonably inferre that the godly man endures not want of reliefe and intertainment, <hi>vers. 17.18.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>Touching the Prophets obseruation in this behalfe: wee must vnderstand that the profession and state of begging was prohibited by the law of God and accursed by him. Whereupon it is credible that no godly man would so carrie himselfe as to be forced to offend against the sayd law, and so to incurre the curse of the Lord: who is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies at the right hand of his children to guide and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="57" facs="tcp:18936:36"/>Hitherto the Prophet hath disputed and cleered three ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iections made against the <hi>fauourable and gratious procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding held by the Lord towards his children.</hi> To which dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute he hath likewise added the discussing of this worthy and comfortable Assertion, concerning <hi>The Lords supply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of reliefe from time to time vnto the godly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now therefore hauing shewed not onely in the former part of the Psalme, but in handling the said obiections and Assertion added thereto, <hi>That the Lord proceedeth with the wicked to their ruine, and with the godly to their good:</hi> he doth returne in the 27. verse to his maine and principall exhortation <hi>of resting vpon the Lord, and walking obedient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To perswade hereto, the Prophet vers. 27. repeateth and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine presenteth vnto vs the conclusion propounded in the 3. verse. The conclusion is this:
<list>
                        <item>
                           <hi>By this course of resting on the Lord, and walking obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diently before him, the godly shall enioy a long, safe and comfortable life,</hi> vers. 27. in the end.</item>
                        <item>
                           <hi>Wherefore rest on the Lord, and walke obediently before him,</hi> vers. 27. in the beginning. Where the later branch of this conclusion which concernes holie obedience of life is onely mentioned: but vnder the name of this, wee are to conceiue likewise of the former as set downe.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now to make it appeare vnto vs that this repetition of the said conclusion is not idle and out of want of other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but of speciall moment and vse: the Prophet drawes into discourse and consideration the doctrine comprised in the Antecedent of the said conclusion, amplifying and cleering the same by sundrie arguments: namely,
<list>
                        <item>1. <hi>By noting vnto vs the cause of enioying so happie and comfortable an estate of life, thus:</hi>

                        </item>

                  <p>The answere hereto is this:
<list>
                        <item>The Lord deliuereth the righteous from the hand of the wicked. <hi>This action of the Lords is in the 33. verse noted by these two par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars: the one, of not leauing the iust in the hands of the wicked: the other, of not suffering him to be iudicially at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:18936:37"/>
of the wicked condemned.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>Therefore howsoeuer the wicked seeke the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch of the iust, yet shall the iust enioy the happie life promised vnto him.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus we see how the Prophet to presse his maine exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>of resting on the Lord, and walking obediently before him,</hi> hath in the 27. verse not onely repeated the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion deliuered in the 3. verse, but hath also set vpon the antecedent part thereof foure worthie illustrations from the beginning of the 28. to the end of the 33. verse. Now in the 34. verse, before he fall to a fresh prosecution of the said exhortation, hee doth (out of a purpose to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>print in our hearts and memories a doctrine of so excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent vse and comfort) recommend again vnto vs the said conclusion offered in the third verse. And then in the end of the 34, he vrgeth and inforceth the said exhortation of <hi>resting on the Lord, and walking obediently before him,</hi> by this argument: which is in number the fourth, whereby the principall question of the Psalme is concluded:
<list>
                        <head>Arg. 4.</head>
                        <item>By this course of resting on the Lord, and walking o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bediently before him, thou shalt obtaine this fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mercie at his hands, as to be an eye witnesse of the execution of the Lords iustice vpon the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, <hi>vers. 34. in the end.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>Wherefore rest vpon him, and walke obediently before him, <hi>vers. 34. in the beginning.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
To the former part of this reason the Prophet hath added a declaration from two comparisons.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. The first is this, carying with it a testimonie of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience:
<list>
                           <item>
                              <hi>I obserued and discerned the wicked to vanish and perish,</hi> vers. 36.</item>
                           <item>
                              <hi>Wherefore obserue and thou also shalt see him va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish and perish,</hi> vers. 34.38.
<list>
                                 <item>The first sentence of this comparison is amplified by the like obseruation made of the wicked mans contrarie estate, thus:
<list>
                                       <pb n="60" facs="tcp:18936:38"/>
                                       <item>
                                          <hi>I saw the wicked florish,</hi> vers. 35. Where this florishing of the wicked is resembled to the spreading and florishing of a Bay tree.</item>
                                       <item>
                                          <hi>So I obserued and discerned him to vanish and perish,</hi> vers. 36.</item>
                                    </list>
                                 </item>

                        </list>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. The second comparison, whereby to shew that the <hi>iust shall see with his eye the ruine of the wicked,</hi> and wherein is noted vnto vs the obseruation of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie euent in the godly, is set downe in this sort:
<list>
                           <item>
                              <hi>Obserue the godly man, and thou shalt see how he endeth his daies in peace and prosperitie,</hi> ver. 37.</item>
                           <item>
                              <hi>Obserue in like manner the wicked, and thou shalt aswell see how he endeth in miserie and destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> vers. 34.38.</item>

                     </item>
                  </list>
                  <p>That part of the second comparison which concernes <hi>the peaceable and prosperous end of the iust,</hi> is thus argued:
<list>
                        <item>Whom the Lord euer helpeth and deliuereth in the time of affliction, their end must needes be peaceable and happie.</item>

                        </item>
                        <item>Therefore the end of the godlie men must needes bee peaceable and happie, <hi>vers. 37.</hi>
                        </item>

                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Assumption</hi> is made knowne and euident by this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son:

                  <p>The actions of the Spirit in the Prophet <hi>Dauid,</hi> are two:

For his passion, the more he indeuoured to quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie and restraine it, being so much the more infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, he doth out of an impatient humour and to shew the greatnes of the miserie hee endured, breake his resolution of silence by tendering vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord this passionate and inconsiderate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest: namely,

                  <p>The particular instance alleaged to argue and witnesse the vanitie of mans indeuours, is this:

                           <hi>Man gathereth riches he knoweth not for whom,</hi> vers. 7. in the end.

                  </p>
                  <p>Hitherto of the Combat, which the Prophet sustained be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the spirit and the flesh: the flesh preuailing so farre with him, as that it drew from him, being not able to containe himselfe within limits of patience and modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the making of an vnaduised motion vnto the Lord for present death.</p>
                  <p>The issue of the Combat followeth in the rest of the verses of this Psalme: namely, from the beginning of the 8. ver. to the ende of the 14. <hi>The said issue is</hi> (as shall appeare) <hi>a plaine and absolute defeate giuen in this combat by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit vnto the flesh.</hi> For after the Prophet had for a while out of his passionate and impatient humor solicited the Lord to retire him out of this life: he doth vpon better aduise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment suggested from the Spirit, correct and checke him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe by calling to minde the folly and vanity of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he tendered vnto the Lord for death. And therefore he reclaymeth himselfe thus in the 8. verse:
<list>
                        <item>But now Lord, what waite I for? <hi>As if he should say:</hi> It is in vayne that I present this inconsiderate request vnto thee: I cannot expect ought from it.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now hereupon, the Prophet changing his former note (the Spirit hauing obteyned victory against the incounters of
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:18936:41"/>
the flesh) he becommeth an humble suter vnto the Lord, namely:
<list>
                        <item>That the Lord would be pleased to remoue from him his present affliction, <hi>vers. 11.13.14.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>This sute for the remoue of the affliction presently vpon him, is the issue of the combat aboue mentioned and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed.</p>
                  <p>To perswade the Lord to giue him satisfaction by the grant of the said sute, he pleadeth by sundry arguments. The first is this:
<list>
                        <head>Arg. 1.</head>
                        <item>My hope and confidence for mercie and deliuerance is in thee O Lord, <hi>vers. 8. in the end.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>Therefore withdraw, I pray thee, thy afflicting hand from me, <hi>vers. 11.13.14.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The sequell of this reason hath for the warrant and ground thereof, <hi>the Lords promise to deliuer those who rest vpon him:</hi> which promise is the proposition of this first conclusion: but omitted by the Prophet, as a matter alreadie being in the publike knowledge of all.</p>
                  <p>Here, before the Prophet proceede to a further pressing of his humble sute: forasmuch as his conscience tels him that his sinnes haue originally drawne vpon him his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent affliction: least the consideration of them should on the part of the Lord be a bar to his said sute; he doth for this regard <hi>humbly intreate, in the</hi> 9. <hi>verse a remission of all his transgressions:</hi> iustly apprehending that the cause be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing remoued, the effect also will determine. This motion doth carrie with it a confession of his sinne against God, and an acknowledgement of the desert thereof: which is a reason of moment to induce the Lord to remit sinne. As this clause of the said 9. verse, <hi>Deliuer me from all my transgressions,</hi> doth aptly receiue the exposition &amp; sense I haue set downe: so may it not vnfitly and with good warrant be expounded <hi>of the remoue of the present crosse which the Prophet endured as a punishment due to his trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions.</hi> Which interpretation being allowed of, the said clause must then serue as a conclusion to the first ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:18936:41"/>
and to all other the motiues presented vnto the Lord by the Prophet, <hi>for deliuerance from the present trouble wherein he was.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The second argument, whereby hee mediateth with the Lord the <hi>remoue of his present affliction,</hi> doth remember vnto the Lord the euent and inconuenience that will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue vpon the said affliction, in case it be continued:
<list>
                        <head>Arg. 2.</head>
                        <item>If the affliction that is presently vpon me, will expose me and my profession of thy name as a scorne vnto the wicked: I pray thee (O Lord) remooue it from me.</item>
                        <item>But the affliction that is presently vpon me, wil expose me and my profession of thy name as a scorne vnto the wicked, <hi>vers. 9. in the end. Where it is said:</hi> Make me not a reproch vnto the foolish: <hi>that is, withdraw this affliction from me, least the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance thereof occasion the foolish and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked to traduce and reproch my profession of thy name. So as in this later clause of the ninth verse, there is folded vp and included aswell the Prophets sute as the argument to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade it.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>Therefore I pray thee (O Lord) remoue the said af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction from me.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Prophet hauing presented vnto the Lord, who is iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of his owne honour and euer ready to giue proofe how highly hee doth valew it, the remembrance of the imputation and scandall, that may be throwne vpon the profession of his name, in case of the continuance of the said affliction: he doth in the 10. verse adde hereto a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall inducement grounded vpon the Lords gracious na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and promise to help those who with patience sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit themselues to his good pleasure. The inducement is of this sort:
<list>
                        <head>Arg. 3.</head>
                        <item>I doe now in all patience and reuerence humble my selfe before thee, submitting my selfe wholy to thy good pleasure, <hi>vers. 10. in the former part.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>
                           <pb n="68" facs="tcp:18936:42"/>It may please thee therefore O Lord to haue mercie on me, and to deliuer me from my present trouble, <hi>vers. 11.13.14.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The former sentence of this reason, which concernes the Prophets submittance of himselfe in al humilitie and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience vnto the Lords good pleasure, is amplifyed by drawing into consideration the principall efficient and author of the affliction laid vpon the Prophet, thus:
<list>
                        <item>I do acknowledge that it is thou (O Lord) who hast laid this present affliction vpon me, <hi>vers. 10. in the end.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>Therefore doe I in all patience and reuerence humble my selfe before thee, and submit my selfe wholy to thy good pleasure, <hi>vers. 10. in the beginning.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Prophet giuing the Lord no rest till hee find rest from his trouble, doth by a fourth argument solicite his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailing with the Lord in his sute: thus,
<list>
                        <head>Arg. 4.</head>
                        <item>
                           <hi>I quaile and faint vnder the burden of this my affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, it being farre surpassing my strength,</hi> ver. 11 in the end.</item>
                        <item>
                           <hi>It may please thee therefore (O Lord) to remoue it from me,</hi> vers. 11. in the beginning. Where the Prophet maketh his request in these words: <hi>Remoue from me thy wound:</hi> that is, the affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction laid vpon me, which is to my person and state, as a wound vnto my bodie.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ground of this fourth reason is a consideration of the Lords most wise and gracious proceeding: who doth proportion out afflictions to the measure of strength in his children: and will not suffer the rod of the vngodlie to rest on his Saints, least they also should reach out their hand to iniquitie.</p>
                  <p>To the Antecedent of this fourth reason the Prophet hath yeelded this illustration:
<list>
                        <item>
                           <hi>If no man be of sufficient strength to endure thy affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting hand, then must I needes faint vnder it.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>
                           <hi>But no man is of sufficient strength to endure thy affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting hand,</hi> vers. 12. Where the Prophet sheweth,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:18936:42"/>
that man is no more able to beare the burden of affliction, than a moth is able to endure a bruse offered vnto it by ones hand. But assoone as the Lord afflicteth him for his sinne, hee melteth and dissolueth as being of no strength to beare it.</item>
                        <item>
                           <hi>Therefore must I needes faint vnder it,</hi> vers. 11. in the end.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Assumption</hi> is amplified by three seuerall arguments: namely,
<list>
                        <item>1. <hi>By noting the efficient cause mouing the Lord to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict punishments:</hi> which is the iniquitie of man, vers. 12. in the first part thereof.</item>
                        <item>2. <hi>By a comparison:</hi> wherein man and whatsoeuer is of strength and excellencie in man, is compared in weaknes to a moth, thus:
<list>
                              <item>
                                 <hi>As a moth is so exceedingly brittle, as that with a touch of the finger it is presently dissolued:</hi>
                              </item>
                              <item>
                                 <hi>So man and whatsoeuer is of strength and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency in man is so weake, that it cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the touch of the Lords afflicting finger, without being reduced to nought,</hi> vers. 12. in the middest.</item>
                           </list>
                        </item>
                        <item>3. <hi>By imparting with vs the nature and condition of man:</hi> he being in his nature &amp; condition nought else but a meere vanitie. Out of which considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he thus concludeth:
<list>
                              <item>
                                 <hi>Nothing meerely vanity is of sufficient strength to endure the afflicting hand of God.</hi>
                              </item>
                              <item>
                                 <hi>Euery man is meerely vanitie,</hi> vers. 12. in the end.</item>
                              <item>
                                 <hi>Therefore no man is of sufficient strength to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the afflicting hand of God,</hi> vers. 12. in the former part of the verse.</item>
                           </list>

                  </p>
                  <p>The Prophet hauing thus dilated vpon the fourth argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he returnes to solicite his maine sute, remembring vnto the Lord the qualitie and condition of his life, as a reason whereby to draw the Lord to a mercifull regard of his said sute. His conclusion is this:

                        <pb n="70" facs="tcp:18936:43"/>

                  <p>The <hi>Assumption</hi> is not expressed in these very termes: but in steed of the said <hi>Assumption,</hi> the illustration thereof is set downe thus:
<list>
                        <item>I am a pilgrim and a seiourner here vpon earth, as my predecessors were, <hi>vers. 13. in the end.</hi>

                        <item>Therefore am I of a short abode here vpon earth and in this life.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The conclusion of the 5. argument being in the beginning of the 13. verse, is there amplified by acquainting vs with the manner and forme of offering vnto the Lord this petition for deliuerance from the said affliction. The manner and forme here vsed, is <hi>The petitioners extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie vehemencie and earnestnes in pressing the Lord to a grant of the petition offered.</hi> This extraordinary vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie in the petitioner, is expressed in this sort:
<list>
                        <item>1. <hi>By iterations of calling vpon the Lord to heare him.</hi> For he doth thrice call on the Lord to heare him, vers. 13. in the beginning and middest.</item>
                        <item>2. <hi>By the petitioners crying vnto the Lord,</hi> vers. 13. in the middest.</item>
                        <item>3. <hi>By effusion of his teares,</hi> vers. 13. in the middest.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>This vehemency and earnestnesse of the petitioner with the Lord, expressed by the particulars mentioned, may serue for a motiue whereby to preuaile with the Lord in this sute for deliuerance. For this earnestnes and importtuna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie in our praiers proceeding fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a true sense of our wants and accompanied with faith in the Lords promises, is a thing commaunded by him and such as wherein hee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth

speciall contentment: and for that regard of great force with the Lord.</p>
                  <p>The Prophet hauing bin thus extraordinarily earnest with the Lord in the 13 verse: hee doth in the 14. and last verse close vp and conclude his sute, by propounding vnto the Lord the end for which he beggeth deliuerance from the present crosse which lieth so heauily vpon him.

                  <head>ANALYS. PSALM. 49.</head>
                  <p>The position debated by the Prophet in this Psalme, I take to be this:
<list>
                        <item>That the godly should not feare the wicked, though abounding in riches and glorying in the strength of them, <hi>vers. 17.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>That this is the position handled here by the Prophet, may appeare by comparing the 17. verse with the 6. and 7: where the Prophet professing this much, that there is no cause why himself should feare the wicked, namely, <hi>such as repose on their wealth and boast in the multitude of their riches, though they beset him on each side, and be as it were at his heeles ready to surprize him.</hi> After he hath at large from the beginning of the 8. verse to the end of the 16. set downe an illustration and proofe of that which he so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth of himselfe: he doth in the 17. verse direct his speech to all godly men in generall, concluding by way of exhortation out of the argument and profession deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered in the said 6. and 7. verse, <hi>That none of them ought to feare the wicked, though abounding in riches and glorying in the strength of them.</hi> This particle of the position, which concernes the glorying of the wicked in their wealth, is not in the 17. verse expressed in formall and distinct termes: but forasmuch as it is added by the Prophet to the argument vsed in the 6. and 7. for proofe of the 17: we must conceiue it to be a part of the position couched in the said 17. verse.</p>
                  <p>Now before he proceede to a reall discussing of the said po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition: forasmuch as it containes no vulgar and meane point of knowledge, but such a doctrine as is worthie of all regard, howsoeuer it may seeme in the eye of the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall man a contemptible paradoxe: the Prophet hath thought meete to honour it with a preface.</p>
                  <p>In the preface, the Prophet

                  <p>The summons is performed by him,

                  <p>In the generall summons, all people and inhabitants of the earth indistinctly are cited. But least any should thinke themselues priuiledged and exempted from tendering their appearance vpon this generall summons: hee doth in the 3. verse particulate the seuerall estates and degrees of persons, that are cited to appeare: namely, <hi>The vulgar people, the noble, the rich, and the poore.</hi> And these, as they are all equally and without partialitie summoned: so are they all indifferentlie and without personall regard bound to become auditors of the doctrine to bee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded.</p>
                  <p>His soliciting of audience and attention at the hands of all people of what degree and qualitie soeuer is performed by presenting vnto their consideration:
<list>
                        <item>1. <hi>The excellencie and worthines of the said doctrine,</hi> vers. 4. Where to note the singular value of it, and the instruction it doth minister, it is intitled by the name of wisedome and knowledge: and in the 5. verse, by the name of a parable and sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence most worthie to be obserued.</item>
                        <item>2. <hi>His readines to concurre with them in a serious me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation thereof,</hi> ver. 5. in the beginning. Where he professeth that in regard of the excellencie of the said doctrine, he will incline his eare thereto, that is, withall care and reuerence meditate thereon together with them.</item>
                        <item>3. <hi>The manner and forme of tendring and publishing the said doctrine,</hi> vers. 5. in the end. Where he saith, that he will deliuer and publish it on his harpe, that is, in such forme and manner as is very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing and delightfull.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>These particular motiues vsed by the Prophet to solicite and
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:18936:45"/>
draw all the inhabitants of the earth to an attentiue hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the said doctrine, are thus concluded:
<list>
                        <item>If the doctrine I propound, containe matter of excellent wisedome: if my selfe shall in person readily concurre with all men in the serious meditation of it: if I shall publish it in a pleasing forme and sort: then let all men attentiuely heare the said doctrine.</item>
                        <item>But the doctrine I propound, containes matter of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent wisedome: my selfe shall in person readily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre with all men in the serious meditation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: I shall publish it in a pleasing forme and sort. <hi>vers. 4.5.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>Therefore let all men attentiuely heare the said doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, <hi>vers. 2.3.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Prophet hauing thus summoned and solicited each condition and sort of people to the hearing of the said doctrine: hee doth now proceede to a particular and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall demonstration of the same. The doctrine to bee demonstrated, is the position aboue remembred, namely:
<list>
                        <item>That the godly man should not feare the wicked, though abounding in riches and glorying in the strength of them, <hi>vers. 17.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The demonstration of this position is twofold:
<list>
                        <item>The one from an instance in the Prophets one person, deliuered in a comparison of paritie, <hi>vers. 6. and 7.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>The other is from the consideration of the wretched con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition whereto the wicked are subiect at their death. <hi>vers. 18.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The instance taken from the Prophets owne person for clee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the said position is concluded thus:
<list>
                        <item>I the Prophet feare not the wicked, though abounding in wealth and glorying in the strength thereof, <hi>ver. 6.7.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>Therefore let no other godly man feare them, <hi>vers. 17.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The former part of this reason, which containes the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance taken from the Prophets owne person, is cleered thus:
<list>
                        <pb n="76" facs="tcp:18936:46"/>
                        <item>If the wicked notwithstanding their wealth dye in their owne persons: in the memorie and honour of their names: and likewise in the persons of their posteritie: then is there no iust cause why I the Prophet should feare them, though glorying in the strength of their wealth.</item>
                        <item>But the wicked, notwithstanding their wealth, die in their owne persons: they die in the memorie and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of their names: they die also in the persons of their posteritie. <hi>The first branch of this Assump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is vers. 8. &amp; 10: the second is vers. 12. and 13: the third is vers. 15.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>Therefore there is no iust cause why I the Prophet should feare the wicked, though glorying in the strength of their wealth, <hi>vers. 6. and 7.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The first branch of the <hi>Assumption,</hi> which concernes the dying of the wicked in their owne persons, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the strength of their wealth, is expressed ver. 8. &amp; 10. Where it is confidently auerred, that out of the strength of riches there cannot be presented vnto God a sufficient price whereby to deliuer the wicked from death into a state of immortalitie in this life. Which in summe and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect is all one, as if it were said: The wicked are vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly to dye in their owne persons, notwithstanding the strength of their wealth wherein they trust. Now this first branch of the said <hi>Assumption</hi> is proued by two se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall arguments: whereof
<list>
                        <item>
                           <hi>The one is set downe,</hi> vers. 9.</item>
                        <item>
                           <hi>The other is deliuered,</hi> vers. 11.</item>

                  </p>
                  <list>
                     <item>In the 9. verse, the argument prouing that the wicked, notwithstanding their riches, die in their owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, is concluded thus:
<list>
                           <item>
                              <hi>If it be impossible out of riches to present vnto the Lord a sufficient value whereby to deliuer the wicked from death: then are they, notwihhstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their riches, assuredly to die in their owne persons.</hi>
                           </item>
                           <item>
                              <pb n="77" facs="tcp:18936:46"/>
                              <hi>But it is impossible out of riches to present vnto the Lord a sufficient value whereby to deliuer the wicked from death,</hi> vers. 9.</item>
                           <item>
                              <hi>Therfore the wicked, notwithstanding their riches, are assuredly to die in their owne persons,</hi> vers. 8. and 10.</item>
                        </list>
                     </item>
                     <item>In the 11. verse, the proofe that the wicked, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing their riches, are to die in their own persons, is this:
<list>
                           <item>
                              <hi>All men, aswell the wise as the foolish, doe in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son die,</hi> vers. 11.</item>
                           <item>
                              <hi>The wicked are in the number of the wise, or the foolish.</hi>
                           </item>
                           <item>
                              <hi>Therfore the wicked, notwithstanding their riches, doe in person die,</hi> vers. 8. and 10.</item>

                     </item>
                  </list>
                  <p>The proposition is confirmed:
<list>
                        <item>1. <hi>By a testimonie from common experience and obseruation,</hi> vers. 11. in the beginning. Where it is said, <hi>That it is seene and obserued, that the wise and the foolish die: and therefore it is out of question that they die.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>2. <hi>By a speciall act of leauing their goods to others either by testament and gift, or by way of other conueiance.</hi> The conclusion is this:
<list>
                              <item>
                                 <hi>They leaue their wealth to others by way of testament, or other conueiance,</hi> vers. 11. in the end. But in case they had an immortalitie on earth; they would not leaue or abandon that, which is the intertainment of their life and the strength they repose on.</item>
                              <item>
                                 <hi>Therefore it is apparant that they are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to death,</hi> ver. 11. in the beginning.</item>
                           </list>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The second branch of the aboue mentioned <hi>Assumption</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting the <hi>dying of the wicked in the memory and honour of their names,</hi> is recorded in the beginning of the 13. verse. Where it is said: <hi>Yet man shall not continue in honor:</hi>
                     <pb n="78" facs="tcp:18936:47"/>
that is: he cannot make the memorie and honor of his name immortall: but the memory of his name shall pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish. In this exposition, as being most sutable with the sense of the 12. verse immediately proceeding, I follow the French.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That the wicked die in the memorie and honour of their names,</hi> the Prophet sheweth:
<list>
                        <item>1. <hi>By an argument of Diuersitie:</hi> wherein hee impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth with vs, first the end which the wicked pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound vnto themselues, namely the immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of their names amongst men: secondly, the meanes vsed by them for attaining to this end: which is the building of magnificall houses, and intitling them with their names. Now the said ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is thus set downe:

                                 <hi>The intention of the wicked is to eternize the memorie of their names, by building faire houses and calling them by their names vpon earth:</hi> that is, amongst men in the world, v. 12. Where by particulating this meanes of giuing immortalitie to their names, he vnderstandeth all other meanes to this purpose.</item>

Hereupon in the 15. verse the Prophet inferreth that it succedeth with them as with their predecessors.

                  <p>Thus you see the Description made by the Prophet of the Maiestie of the Lords comming to sit in iudgement vpon the cause in controuersie betwixt him and his people. And this is the first argument whereby to raise vp in the Israelites all attentiue and reuerent hearing of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>The second argument for this end and purpose, is a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue propounded by the Lord himselfe, and concluded thus:
<list>
                        <item>I who speake vnto thee (O Israel) am be, who hath co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenanted with thee to bee a God of infinite mercie and fauour vnto thee, <hi>vers. 7. in the end. Where it is said:</hi> I am God, euen thy God. <hi>Which words doe import, that the Lord hath couenanted with his people to bestow vpon them the blessings of this and the future life.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>Therefore thou oughtest in dutie to heare me with all attention and reuerence, while I contest with thee and decide the cause in question betwixt vs, <hi>ver. 7. in the beginning.</hi>

                  <p>Hitherto of the preface of this Psalme. There followeth now to be considered, The Lords contestation with the Israelites about this questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his worship. Of the Lords contestation in this behalfe there be two parts:
<list>
                        <pb n="87" facs="tcp:18936:51"/>
                        <item>
                           <hi>The one, a refutation of their colourable pretences and allegations.</hi> From the beginning of the 8. verse to the end of the 13: and then from the beginning of the 16. verse to the end of the 21.</item>
                        <item>
                           <hi>The other, a pronouncing of sentence vpon the cause in controuersie: first interlocutorily,</hi> vers. 14. and 15: <hi>and then definitiuely,</hi> vers. 23.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>Touching the refutation made by the Lord of their colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable pretences &amp; allegations in this questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship by sacrifices: to the end we may the better discerne and iudge how the Lord manageth the same: wee must vnfold and lay to open view the said allegations and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences: they being not here expressed, but implied and left to our collection by the answere that is made vnto them. The first pretence on the part of the Israelites for the iustifying of the worship they performe vnto the Lord in offering of sacrifices, is this:
<list>
                        <item>If the worship we tender vnto thee in offring our sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices be hypocriticall and worthie of censure: thou wilt not reprooue our failing to offer them as often as is in thy law prescribed. <hi>For the omission of a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full act is not reprouable.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>But thou wilt reprooue our failing to offer sacrifices as often as is in thy law prescribed.</item>
                        <item>Therefore the worship we tender vnto thee in offring our sacrifices, is not hypocriticall and worthie of censure.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Lords answere hereto is deliuered in the 8. verse: where by way of contradiction he doth publikely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test against the <hi>Assumption</hi> of this their first pretence, in this sort:
<list>
                        <item>I will not (saith the Lord) reprooue thee for thy sacrifices, or thy burnt offrings, though they were not continually before me: <hi>that is, as often as is prescribed, vers. 8.</hi>

                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>This his protestation against the <hi>Assumption</hi> of the Israelites first pretence, the Lord by force of argument doth make good and iustifie after this manner:

                        <item>If I should reprooue thy failing in this behalfe, it might seeme I had neede to demaund and take sacrifices at thy hands.</item>
                        <item>But I haue no neede to demaund and take sacrifices at thy hands, <hi>vers. 9. That of this ninth verse the sense is such as I haue set downe, may appeare by the proofe thereof added in the two verses imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly following.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>Therefore I will not reprooue thy failing in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe, <hi>vers. 8.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Assumption</hi> contained in this answere made by the Lord, is cleared by him:

                              <hi>If I desired sacrifices and took contentment in them: yet should I not need to demand and take a supplie of them at thy hands,</hi> v. 12. Where by the word, <hi>hungring,</hi> is signified the affection of desiring sacrifices: and by saying, <hi>I would not tell thee,</hi> is implied a resolution on the Lords part not to demaund any sacrifices of them. So as hee maketh the Israelites see hereby, that howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer he should desire sacrifices, yet it followeth not that he would demand any at their hands.</item>
                           <item>But now to make this euident, that the Lord, though he desired sacrifices, yet neede not to demand them of the Israelites: he addeth and repeateth vers. 12, the reason which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned in the 10. and 11. verse. The reason is this:

                  <p>The interlocutorie sentence being thus pronounced: the Israelites notwithstanding, as if they rested yet vnsatisfied in the question of the Lords worship; replie againe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Lord in the behalfe of their sacrificing, thus:

                  </p>
                  <p>In answere hereto, the Lord disavoweth the <hi>Assumption</hi> of this reply and reiecteth it as absolutely vntrue, prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting vnto the hypocriticall Isralites, v. 16: <hi>That their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of pietie and obedience is very odious in his sight.</hi> And this I take to be the true meaning of the expostulation deliuered in the said 16. verse: where the Lord doth by way of detestation reprooue the Israelites, in that they being of a prophane and impious heart, doe notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing in words and in the outward obseruances of sacrificing pretend great pietie: speaking with such re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect and reuerence of the Lords word and couenant, as if their harts were free from all thought of impiety, and their actions of sacrificing conformable to the law of the Lord. Now why their profession of pietie and obedience should bee odious in his sight, the Lord rendreth this reason:
<list>
                        <item>Who carrieth himselfe wickedly in the traine of his life, his profession of pietie is odious in my sight.</item>
                        <item>But thou, O Israel, carriest thy selfe wickedly in the traine of thy life, <hi>vers. 21. Where it is said:</hi> Thou diddest these things: <hi>that is, thou hast imployed
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:18936:54"/>
thy selfe in these wicked actions.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>Therefore thou art he whose profession of pietie is odious in my sight. <hi>vers. 16.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Assumption</hi> is cleared by the Lord, by laying forth in particularity sundry wicked actions committed by this hypocriticall crew of Israelites:
<list>
                        <item>Thou canst not (saith the Lord) endure reproofe: and thou contemnest mine holy word, <hi>vers. 17:</hi> Thou doest consort with theeues and adulterers, partaking in their sinnes, <hi>vers. 18:</hi> Thy speech is wicked and deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, <hi>vers. 19:</hi> Thou doest not spare to slander euen thine owne brother, <hi>vers. 20:</hi> Thou imaginest me the eternall Lord to patronize and allow this thy wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, <hi>vers. 21. in the middest.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>Therefore thou carriest thy selfe wickedly in the traine of thy life, <hi>vers. 21. in the beginning.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The last particular sin, wherewith in the antecedent part of this reason, the Lord chargeth the said hypocritical crew, being set downe in the middest of the 21. verse, is there amplified,
<list>
                        <item>1. <hi>By noting the cause of that impious imagination in the wicked.</hi> Now the cause which moueth the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked man to imagine that the Lord fauoureth and alloweth his wickednes, is the Lords long pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and delay of punishment, vers. 21. in these words: <hi>Because I held my tongue:</hi> that is, because I spared thee a long time and forbare to punish thee: therefore thou thoughtest that I was like thee: that is, concurring with thee in the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of thy wickednes.</item>
                        <item>2. <hi>By setting downe the euent and issue, which the said imagination and this abuse on the part of the wicked of the Lords long sufferance, draweth with it. The said euent and issue is this: namely,</hi> The Lords pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding in his good time to a reall punishment of their wickednes. This action the Lord expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth by threatning vnto the wicked such a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:18936:54"/>
and visible detection of their sinnes, such a representation and ranking of them before their eyes, as they shall be forced to acknowledge them without replying ought in their defence. This is then performed, when the Lord doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually execute his iustice on the wicked.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hitherto from the beginning of the 8. verse to the ende of the 21. (the 14. verse and 15. onely excepted, where the said interlocutorie sentence is recorded) hath the Lord deliuered his refutation of such colorable pretences and allegations, as the Israelites vsed in defence of the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship they performed in offering sacrifices.</p>
                  <p>There followeth now the Lords proceeding to definitiue sentence. But before the pronouncing thereof, hee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresseth vnto the Israelites an exhortation to obserue and consider seriously both what hath been already deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered, and what the determination is hee makes of this question touching his worship. The said exhortation is inforced by the Lord, thus:
<list>
                        <item>You shall perish, in case the cariage of the worship you are to present vnto me be disagreeable to the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence pronounced thereon by me, <hi>ver. 22. in the end: where their perishing is expressed vnder these termes:</hi> Least I teare you in peeces, and there be none to deliuer you.</item>
                        <item>Therefore obserue and consider seriously the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I make of this question touching my worship, <hi>vers. 22. in the beginning.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>This exhortation being premised: the <hi>Definitiue sentence</hi> followeth in the 23. verse, in these words:
<list>
                        <item>He that offereth prayse, doth glorifie me: and who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth his way, him will I cause to enioy the saluation of God. <hi>vers. 23.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>This definitiue sentence comprizeth a declaration of the particular, wherein the true worship of the Lord consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth. To the end therefore that none might pretend ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance in this question of the said worship: the Lord
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:18936:55"/>
doth here as cleerely distinguish and define wherein the said worship standeth, as if hee should pronounce and deliuer his definitiue sentence vnder this formall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion:
<list>
                        <item>Whereby the Lord is truly worshipped, and whereto hee promiseth eternall happines, in that the true worship of the Lord consisteth.</item>
                        <item>But by the sacrifice of praise the Lord is truly worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, and to the conformitie of our heart and life vnto his will eternall happines is promised, <hi>vers. 23.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>Therefore in the sacrifice of praise, and in the conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of our heart and life vnto his will, the true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of the Lord consisteth. <hi>This is it, whereto the Lord aimeth in his whole dispute with the Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites in this Psalme.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whereas in the definitiue sentence it is auouched and noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, that the Lord is truly honoured by the offer and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of praise: we are vnder the name of this one part of the Lords worship, to conceiue as meant, each other part and duty of spirituall obedience vnto God, whereby we doe him this honor, as to confesse and acknowledge to the glory of his name that he is the God, by whom all things in heauen and earth are disposed and ordered in wisedome, power, mercy and iustice: and that in regard thereof we owe vnto him all reuerent acknowledgement and seruice whatsoeuer.</p>

                  <p>Let vs now see how hee pleadeth with the Lord for the graunt of this pardon. To perswade the Lord hereto, he vseth sundrie arguments. The first whereof is this:

                        <item>Thou art O Lord of a nature gratious, and abounding in compassion, <hi>vers. 3. in the middest.</hi>

Prophet doth acquaint the Lord how hee demeaneth himselfe in this behalfe: namely, that he doth with griefe of heart humbly confesse and acknowledge his iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.

                        <item>1. <hi>From the efficient cause both of the pardon desired, and of the righteousnesse ensuing thereupon: which is the sprinkling of the blood of the Messias, figured by the ceremoniall sprinkling of hyssope,</hi> vers. 9. in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</item>
                        <item>2. <hi>From a double comparison: for in the said</hi> 9. <hi>verse:</hi>

                                 <hi>First, he compareth the righteousnes spoken of, to the puritie and beautie that followeth vpon purging and clensing.</hi> The comparison being in her parts laid foorth, is this:

                                    <item>
                                       <hi>As he that is purged and washed becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth cleane and faire:</hi>

                                 <hi>Secondly, he compareth the said righteousnes to the whitenes of snow,</hi> vers. 9. in the end: where hee maketh the degree of perfection in the sayd righteousnesse to exceede the perfection of whitenes in snow. The comparison is this:
<list>
                                    <item>
                                       <hi>The perfection of whitenes in snow is in a very high degree:</hi>

                                 </list>

                  </p>
                  <p>The Prophet being exceedinglie afflicted aswell with griefe in that he had displeased the Lord, as with the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the iudgements denounced by <hi>Nathan</hi> against his sinnes: and being desirous to be relieued in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe out of some special knowledge and assurance in his
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:18936:58"/>
heart, that the Lord is reconciled vnto him: doth by way of amplifying the sute for remission of his sins, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie the same in the 10. verse with interposing this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest:
<list>
                        <item>That the Lord would be pleased not onely to be reconciled vnto him, but assure him likewise hereof, <hi>vers. 10.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>This motion for some assurance in his heart, that the Lord hath remitted his iniquities, is propounded and deliuered in these termes: <hi>Make me to heare ioy and gladnes.</hi> As by hearing, he meaneth such a knowledge as may assure him: so by ioy and gladnes, hee vnderstandeth the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and reconcilement it selfe, whereof he is desirous to bee assured. This reconcilement he calleth by the name of ioy and gladnes, to note the comfortable effect, which it worketh in the heart of an humbled and penitent sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
                  <p>Now this motion for assurance in his heart of pardon and reconcilement on the Lords part, hee enlargeth and vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth in the 10. verse by a consideration taken from this particular end thereof: namely,
<list>
                        <item>That as hee hath been deiected and broken both with griefe for his sinne, and with feare of the iudgements denounced against him:</item>
                        <item>So he may vpon assurance in his heart of the Lords re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concilement with him, take speciall ioy and comfort in his ancient loue and fauour towards him, <hi>vers. 10. Where the Prophet resembleth the breaking of his heart with griefe, to the breaking of his bones by any force and violence.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hitherto from the beginning of the 3 verse to the end of the 11, the Prophet hath by sundrie reasons mediated with the Lord the pardon of his sinnes. Now followeth the humble motion he maketh for restitution vnto his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer estate:
<list>
                        <item>1. <hi>Of inward grace and sanctification.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>2. <hi>Of outward fauours and prerogatiues.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>For restitution vnto his former estate of sanctification, hee
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:18936:59"/>
deliuereth his motion vnder these termes:
<list>
                        <item>Create in me a cleane heart O God: and renew within me a constant spirit, <hi>vers. 12.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The thing requested in this motion, is a reuiuing of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer holy desire and care to serue the Lord euer after in obedience of hart &amp; life. This reuiuing of the said desire and care he calleth the <hi>creating of a cleane heart</hi> in the first part of the verse: and <hi>the renewing of a constant spirit</hi> in the latter part thereof. <hi>Dauid</hi> had vpon his fall so little sense and feeling of the grace of sanctification, as that hee speakes as if he had vtterly lost it, and so stood in need of a new infusion and creation thereof: whereas it was not vtterly extinguished, but exceedingly impayred and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed onely: as may appeare in that by way of interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation he calleth it in the latter patt of the verse, <hi>a reno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation and raising thereof to the same degree wherein it was in former time.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This reuiuing of his former holie desire and care to serue the Lord, the Prophet describeth vnto vs:
<list>
                        <item>1. <hi>By noting the principall efficient and author thereof: who is God.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>2. <hi>By declaring the subiect, wherein it is: namely, the heart.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>3. <hi>By implying the forme and manner of working it: which is, by a course of purging and clensing the heart.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>4. <hi>By shewing, that he would haue this grace of renoua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (which he calleth a constant spirit) permanent and firme, not subiect to alteration. So as here withall is implied the end of the said renouation: namely, That he may euer without defection honor God.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>His petition to bee restored vnto his former estate of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward fauours and prerogatiues, is conteined verse 13. and 14. in these words:
<list>
                        <item>Cast me not away from thy face: and take not thine holie spirit from me: but restore vnto me the ioy of thy sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, and support me with thy free spirit, <hi>vers. 13.14.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="103" facs="tcp:18936:59"/>It seemes that in presenting of this motion, the Prophet had a reference to the Lords proceeding with <hi>Saul,</hi> who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he cast off, and from whom he retyred the graces of his spirit. And therefore by these words (<hi>thy face, thy holy spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, the ioy of thy saluation</hi>) I take to be meant the outward testimonies and prerogatiues of the Lords kinde and fauourable proceeding with <hi>Dauid,</hi> in which hee was wont to reioyce: namely,
<list>
                        <item>1. <hi>The place of the Lords worship, whereto he resorted.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>2. <hi>The continuance of the Scepter in his person and the line of his posteritie.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>3. <hi>His abilitie to manage the duties of his calling in the said Scepter.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>4. <hi>The loue and obedience of his subiects towards him.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>5. <hi>Good successe in the courses held by him.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>6. <hi>The Lords protection of him.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>These graces and fauours are <hi>the Lords face, the Lords spirit, the ioy of the Lords saluation:</hi> which the Prophet by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert on his part, and by the rule of iustice on the Lords part, had forfeited and lost: howsoeuer in act and by the Lords most gratious sufferance, he enioyed them as yet. And therefore discerning in his heart of the forfeiture he had made in this behalfe, prayeth the Lord in the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth verse: <hi>That neither himselfe may be remoued from them, nor they withdrawne from him: But that the Lord would be pleased</hi> (as he prayes, vers. 14.) <hi>to restore and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme vnto him his former title and interest in them: and so by the power of his spirit support him in the comfortable and free enioyance of the said prerogatiues.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hereby we plainly discerne what is the subiect of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets petition in this place: namely, That whereas in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert on his part, and by the law of iustice on the part of the Lord, he had forfeited the said fauours and prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiues:
<list>
                        <item>The Lord notwithstanding would be pleased to reconfirme vnto him his former title and interest in them, and support him in the enioyance of the same, <hi>vers. 14.</hi>

                     <pb n="104" facs="tcp:18936:60"/>This sute he handleth and amplifieth:

                        <item>1. <hi>By an argument of Diuersitie, thus:</hi>

                        </item>
                        <item>2. <hi>By noting the efficient cause, whereby this reconfirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and support is to be performed: namely, the free, cheerefull, and comfortable spirit of the Lord: which doth infranchise vs into the state of the Lords children, and doth intertaine vs therein.</hi>
                        </item>

                  </p>
                  <p>The Prophet hauing singly and in seuerall made tender vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord of his humble sute, first for pardon of his sin: and then, that he may be restored and reinuested into his former estate aswell of inward grace and sanctification, as of outward fauours and prerogatiues: he doth now ioyntly and in common plead for graunt of the whole sute he maketh for himselfe in this Psalme. His sute for himselfe considered ioyntly in all the parts thereof, is now this:
<list>
                        <item>That the Lord would be pleased to grant him both pardon of his sinne, and restitution also into his former estate aswell of inward grace as outward fauours, <hi>vers. 16.</hi>

                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>This ioynt sute for these three particulars I take to be speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally meant and deliuered in the 16. verse. For whereas he saith: <hi>Deliuer me O God from blood:</hi> his sute may well be interpreted to be this; That the Lord would not onely remit vnto him his sinne: but remit likewise this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular punishment due vnto his sinne: namely, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture he hath made aswell of the measure he had of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward grace, as of the outward prerogatiues aboue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred.</p>
                  <p>To perswade the Lord to yeeld him contentment herein; the Prophet acquaints him with a double resolution hee hath in his heart, wherby to glorifie him. For vpon grant of this whole sute, he professeth:
<list>
                        <pb n="105" facs="tcp:18936:60"/>
                        <item>1. <hi>That he will further the instruction and conuersion of others vnto the Lord,</hi> vers. 15.</item>
                        <item>2. <hi>That he will publish and magnifie the Lords fidelitie in keeping promise with his children,</hi> vers. 16.17.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The first duty which he professeth to performe for glorify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lord, is concluded thus:
<list>
                        <item>If vpon obtaining mercie at thy hands for pardon of my sinne, and for restitution into my said former estate, I shall be drawne to glorifie thee by furthering the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction and conuersion of others vnto thee: it may please thee (O Lord) to graunt vnto me the pardon and restitution desired by me.</item>
                        <item>But vpon obtaining mercie at thy hands for pardon of my sinne, and for restitution into my said former e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, I shall and will glorifie thee by furthering the instruction and conuersion of others vnto thee, <hi>v. 15. Where the conuersion of others to the profession of the Lords name is set downe as an end: and the instruction of others as a special meane wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to attaine vnto the said end.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>Therefore it may please thee (O Lord) to grant vnto me the pardon and restitution desired by me, <hi>vers. 16.</hi>

                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The second duty he professeth to performe, and by perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance whereof he would moue the Lord to a compassio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate regard of his sute, hath this conclusion:
<list>
                        <item>In case thou shew mercie vnto me for the pardon of my sinne, and for restitution into my said former estate: thou shalt thereby open my lips to publish and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie thy fidelitie in keeping promise with thy children. <hi>vers. 16. and 17.</hi>
                        </item>

                  <p>The Antecedent part of this reason, which containes a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession on the part of the Prophet, of setting forth the praise of the Lords fidelitie in keeping promise with his children, is handled and enlarged thus:

                        <item>
                           <hi>But I will not offer sacrifice vnto thee,</hi> vers. 18. in the middest.

                           <hi>Therefore will I offer praise vnto thee,</hi> vers. 16. and 17. In the 16. he affirmeth that his tongue shall sing the Lords righteousnes and fidelitie in keeping promise.

                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Assumption</hi> is cleered by this argument:

                           <hi>But sacrifice is not accompanied with an humble and contrite heart.</hi> This sentence is not here set down: but omitted as a sinne knowne and obserued as well out of the practise in those daies on the part of the prophane and hypocriticall Israelites, as out of the publike reproofe and reiection made by the Lord of the ordinarie sacrifices presented vnto him, as being odious in his sight.</item>
                        <item>
                           <hi>Therefore sacrifice is not pleasing vnto thee,</hi> ver. 18.</item>

                  </p>
                  <p>Hitherto from the beginning of vers. 3. to the end of the 19, the Prophet hath been an humble and affectionate peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:18936:61"/>
for himselfe. Now he becomes an earnest suter vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord for the Church and common wealth of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael. The effect of his sute is this: that whereas the hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nousnes of his transgressions had iustly occasioned the Lord in iustice to withdraw his fauour from the people vnder <hi>Dauids</hi> gouernement:
<list>
                        <item>The Lord would be pleased, notwithstanding his sinnes, to aduance the publike good of the Church and common wealth of Israel, <hi>vers. 20. in the beginning and end.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whether this publike good desired by the Prophet vnder these formes of speech (<hi>be fauourable vnto Sion: build the walles of Ierusalem</hi>) be the raysing vp and furnishing of a setled place for the Lords worship, or a gracious protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church and common wealth, or a supplying of either of them with carefull officers, is not agreed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. It shalbe sufficient to know that the Prophet is in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall a suter that the state of the Church and common wealth may prosper and flourish, through a supply made by the Lord of all needfull blessings. To induce the Lord hereto the Prophet alleageth two arguments:</p>
                  <p>The first is this:
<list>
                        <item>
                           <hi>Thou art of a nature gratious, and abounding in mercie towards thy people,</hi> vers. 20. in the middest; and in these words: <hi>According to thy good will:</hi> that is, Forasmuch as thou art in nature most gratiouslie and fauourably disposed: therefore be gratious vnto <hi>Sion.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>
                           <hi>Wherefore (O Lord) aduance the publike good of thy people both in the Church and common-wealth,</hi> v. 20. in the beginning and end. Where by <hi>Sion</hi> wee may vnderstand the Church, and by <hi>Ierusalem</hi> the Common-wealth.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The second argument, whereby to perswade the Lord in this behalfe, is drawne from the consideration of the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, which will ensue vpon the Lords gracious procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with the Church and common wealth. And it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede a profession and vow on King <hi>Dauids</hi> part, to
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:18936:62"/>
take order that the people vnder his gouernement shall present vnto the Lord such worship and seruice, as shall be pleasing and acceptable in his sight. His mediation with the Lord by force of this argument is concluded thus:
<list>
                        <item>
                           <hi>If vpon thy aduancing of the publike good of the Church and common-wealth, the honour and worship of thy name shall withall be promoted: then it may please thee (O Lord) to aduance the publike good of the Church and common-wealth.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>
                           <hi>But vpon thy aduancing of the publike good of the Church and common-wealth, the honour and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of thy name shall withall be promoted,</hi> vers. 21. Where the said honour and worship is called by the name of righteous sacrifices, burnt offrings, oblation, offring of calues. Now when this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and worship is such as the Lord is pleased and delighted therewith: it is apparant that then the seruice and worship of his name is greatlie aduanced. So as, where the Prophet saith that the Lord shall then take pleasure in sacrifices, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with the vprightnes and integritie of the heart: his purpose thereby is to notifie vnto vs, that then the Lords worship and seruice shall be much promoted.</item>
                        <item>
                           <hi>Therefore it may please thee (O Lord) to aduance the publike good of the Church &amp; common wealth.</hi> v. 20.</item>

                  <p>The Prophet doth recount vnto vs in this Psalme the issue of a conflict and dispute he had betwixt the Spirit and the flesh. The question disputed was this:
<list>
                        <item>Whether God were good to Israel: that is (as it is vers. <hi>1.</hi> expounded) to such as out of a sanctified heart desire to honour him.</item>

                  <p>The issue of the said conflict and dispute, is a double conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion inferred by the Spirit:

                        </item>
                        <item>The other: a profession of perpetuall dependance on God in regard thereof, <hi>vers. 23. where it is said:</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will I be alway with thee: <hi>that is, I will in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of thy gratious proceeding with thy chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, euer rest vpon thee.</hi>

                        <item>1. <hi>The discourse of the flesh:</hi> from the beginning of the 2. verse vnto the 15.</item>

                  <p>By these comparisons the Prophet would make it appeare that the pride and crueltie of the wicked is in so great a measure, as that a man can discerne nought else in them but pride and cruelty.</p>

                  <p>Hitherto from the beginning of the 2. verse to the ende of the 9, the Prophet hath shewed that himselfe had almost slipt into this prophane conceit of the Lords disregard and neglect of his children, being led thereto by the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course intertained by the wisedome of the flesh.</p>
                  <p>He is now vers. 10. to aduertise vs of that other effect, which the discourse of the flesh hath wrought in many other the Lords children, who also are drawen thereby to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend and hold, <hi>That the Lord is not gracious to Israel, but hath cast off all care and regard of such as sincerely wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship him.</hi> For in the 10. and 11. verse it is said to this effect:
<list>
                        <item>The Lords people also are come to this point (when they drink of the cup of affliction that is reached vnto them) that they say: The mightie God taketh no knowledge or care how it succeedeth with men.</item>

                  </p>
                  <p>The ground of this apprehension in the Lords children, the Prophet setteth downe to be this discourse of the flesh: which in effect is the same with the discourse aboue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred:

                  <p>The latter part of the <hi>Assumption,</hi> which concernes the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed losse of labour in seruing the Lord, is manifested thus:
<list>
                        <item>Whom the Lord doth daily afflict, they lose their labour in seruing him.</item>
                        <item>But the godly are daily afflicted by the Lord, <hi>vers. 14. This is touched likewise in the end of the 10. verse.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>The Prophet hauing from the beginning of the second verse to the 15, deliuered vnto vs y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> discourse of the flesh, together with the effect wrought thereby aswell in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe as in sundrie other the Lords children: doth now verse 15.16.17. acquaint vs with the course hee held, whereby to resolue himselfe touching the maine point in question, namely: <hi>Whether the Lord were good vnto his children.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The course held by the Spirite for resolution in the said maine question of the Lords affection to his people, was the Prophets recourse vnto the Sanctuarie: that is, to the Lords holy word laid vp and reserued in the Sanctuarie, verse. 17: where hee doth apparantly confesse these two things: the one, his entrance into the Sanctuarie: the other, the information receiued there how the Lord stood affected both to the wicked and to the godly: to the wicked as a seuere Iudge: to the godly as a kind and gracious father, euer regarding their good. Of this nature and reach must we conceiue the said information to bee (as may appeare by the verses going before and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) howsoeuer it seeme to concerne the wicked only, in that they alone are mentioned in the 17. verse.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="116" facs="tcp:18936:66"/>Now this course of repairing vnto the Sanctuary, there to be resolued in the said question of the Lords affection to his people, had this discourse in the hart of the Prophet for the ground thereof:
<list>
                        <item>I must iudge of the Lords affection to his people either by his outward proceedings with them, or by the light of his word in the Sanctuarie.</item>
                        <item>But not by his outward proceedings with them, <hi>v. 15.16.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>Therefore by the light of his word in the Sanctuarie, <hi>vers. 17. Vpon this discourse as vpon a good war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and ground, he repaireth vnto the Sanctuary for the purpose aforesaid.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>In liew of the <hi>Assumption,</hi> the Prophet hath in the 15. and 16. verse substituted the proofe thereof by two seueral argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, whereby this course of iudging is disclaimed and found vnworthie to be held, aswell in regard of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudice and wrong which would ensue thereupon to the Lords children, as in respect of the lost labour therein or impossibility to attaine therby vnto the true and certaine knowledge of the Lords affection towards his people. He concludeth thus:
<list>
                        <item>
                           <hi>If to iudge of the Lords affection to his people by his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward proceedings with them would be both a wrong to the profession of his children, and likewise a lost la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour: I will forbeare to iudge of the Lords affection to his people by his outward proceedings with them.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>
                           <hi>But to iudge of the Lords affection to his people by his outward proceedings with them, would bee both a wrong to the profession of his children, and likewise a lost labour,</hi> ver. 15. and 16. In the 15. verse he saith, that in case he should thus speake thereof: that is, thus interpret the Lords affection to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by the outward euents of prosperitie and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersitie, hee should betray the profession of his children, by exposing it to disreputation and contempt. For if it be once apprehended, that the Lord regardeth the wicked aswell as the godly:
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:18936:66"/>
who will hold in any recommendation and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt this profession of worshipping the Lord? In the 16. verse affirming that it seemed vnto him an hard thing to be resolued in the said question: he meaneth that the difficultie was such as all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuours to that purpose became vaine and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse.</item>
                        <item>
                           <hi>Therefore will I forbeare to iudge of the Lords affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his people by his outward proceedings with them.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus you see what the direction and course is which the Spirit held for resolution in the said maine question of the Lords affection towards his people: so as the dispute betwixt the Spirit and the flesh touching this question, was drawne vnto this issue and conclusion:
<list>
                        <item>That the Lord, notwithstanding his prospering of the wicked and his afflicting of the godly, is good vnto Israel.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>We are now to vnderstand from the Prophet being thus particularly and soundly informed out of the Sanctuary, the ground and reason of the said issue and conclusion: which in summe is this:
<list>
                        <item>If the Lord hath ordained for the wicked, howsoeuer they florish, iudgement and destruction: and for the godlie an happie issue from out their trouble: then is God good to Israel.</item>
                        <item>But the Lord hath ordained for the wicked, howsoeuer they florish, iudgement and destruction: and for the godly a blessed issue from out their trouble. <hi>From the 18. verse to the end of the Psalme. Also this bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed issue is implied vers. 1.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>Therefore God is good to Israel, <hi>vers. 1.</hi>

                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The first part of the <hi>Assumption</hi> concerning the destruction of the wicked, is by the Prophet cleered and set forth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, thus:
<list>
                        <pb n="118" facs="tcp:18936:67"/>
                        <item>1. <hi>By comparing their deiecting with their setting vp.</hi> vers. 18.

                                 <hi>As thou hast placed them in a slipperie estate:</hi>

                              <item>
                                 <hi>So doest thou deiect them from the same into vtter desolation.</hi>
                              </item>
                           </list>
                        </item>
                        <item>2. <hi>By noting the manner of their destruction, which is sudden and fearfull,</hi> vers. 19. Where is implied also for cleering this point a testimonie from expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience and obseruation: as if the Prophet should say: <hi>Behold, wee see with our eyes how they are in a moment deiected and destroyed.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>3. <hi>By resembling their vanishing to a dreame,</hi> vers. 20.
<list>
                              <item>
                                 <hi>As a dreame vanisheth when we awake:</hi>
                              </item>
                              <item>
                                 <hi>So vanish the wicked and their prosperitie.</hi>

                           </list>
                        </item>
                        <item>4. <hi>By declaring the efficient cause of their destruction,</hi> ver. 20. in the later part. Where <hi>the Lords awaking:</hi> that is, the displaying of his power to doe iustice on the wicked, is noted to bee the cause, by the force whereof, <hi>their image,</hi> that is, their outward flourishing estate is made contemptible and brought to nought.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The second part of the said <hi>Assumption</hi> which importes the happie issue of the godly from out their trouble, is not in these distinct termes expressed. But forasmuch as the <hi>Word</hi> which discloseth the Lords iustice to the wicked, doth withall discouer his loue &amp; compassion to the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we must conceiue it as set downe in expresse termes: as indeede we find this point of happines on the part of the Lords children, insinuated and comprehended as in the first verse, so likewise in the latter part of the Psalme, which containes the Prophets solemne profession of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually depending vpon the Lord. Which profession of his beginneth vers. 23. and so continueth to the ende of the Psalme.</p>
                  <p>The ground of the said maine issue and conclusion being thus laid forth: the Prophet hath verse 21. and 22. added thereto a confession and censure of the brutish conceit
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:18936:67"/>
whereinto hee was readie to slip, touching the Lords affection to his people. His censure is propounded thus:
<list>
                        <item>When I grieued at the prosperitie of the wicked, and at the affliction of the godly, I was foolish and senselesse, <hi>vers. 21. and the first part of vers. 22.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>When I was ignorant of the Lords affection to his people, I grieued at the prosperitie of the wicked, and at the affliction of the godly. <hi>Omitted.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>Therefore when I was ignorant of the Lords affection to his people, I was foolish and senselesse, <hi>vers. 22. in the later part. Where he expresseth this imputation and marke of foolishnes, by comparing himselfe vnto a beast.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hitherto the first and maine issue of the dispute betwixt the Spirit and the flesh hath been, together with the reason and ground thereof, related vnto vs: namely, <hi>That God is good to Israel.</hi> Now the second issue being a conclusion deduced vpon the former, is to be imparted with vs.</p>
                  <p>This second issue of the said dispute, is the Prophets profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of his perpetual dependance vpon the Lord, ver. 23. in the former part. Where the Prophets protestation of euer being with the Lord, I interprete as meant of adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and cleauing alway vnto him by a liuely and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant faith in his promises: it being faith which first wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth and after intertaineth our spirituall and real vnion with him. Besides, it was a defect in the Prophets faith which made ouerture to this dispute betwixt the Spirit and the flesh: and therefore to shew how he hath profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the victorie of the Spirit, and how ready he is to eschew hereafter the like fault of distrust in the Lord, hee solemnely professeth that he will euer rest and relie vpon him. Lastlie the nature of the arguments alleaged to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade and confirme his perpetual being with the Lord, doth best sute with the said interpretation and point of perpetuall dependance vpon the Lord.</p>
                  <p>This second issue then of the conflict aboue remembred,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:18936:68"/>
being a consequent of the first and maine issue, is by the Prophet inferred thus:
<list>
                        <item>I finde in the Sanctuarie that as God is a seuere Iudge to the wicked, so hee is gratious and good to Israel, <hi>vers. 1.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>Therefore I professe that I will euer depend vpon him. <hi>vers. 23.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>But for a further encouragement of his hart herein, and that it may appeare he hath other good warrant for this his profession, he doth to the reason already alleaged adde sundry excellent inducements, whereby to perswade the withdrawing of his confidence from al worldly meanes, and the reposing thereof wholy vpon the Lord. His se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond reason therefore to this purpose is this:
<list>
                        <item>Thou diddest support me in this temptation and conflict by the direction and power of thy spirit and word, <hi>verse 23. in the end.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>Therefore hauing this experience of thy assistance and fauour towards me, I will euer depend vpon thee, <hi>vers. 23. in the beginning.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third inducement of this his profession, is of this sort:
<list>
                        <item>Thou wilt guide me, in case I depend vpon thee, by the addresse and light of thy word in the way to eternall glorie, <hi>vers. 24.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>Therefore will I euer rest vpon thee, <hi>vers. 23.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The fourth argument perswading this dependance, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded thus:
<list>
                        <item>If I will depend vpon any other besides thee, then is there some in heauen or earth whom I honor and serue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides thee.</item>
                        <item>But there is none in heauen or earth whom I honour and serue besides thee, <hi>vers. 25.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>Therefore will I not depend vpon any other besides thee, <hi>vers. 23.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Prophet stayeth not here, but proceedeth on to a fift reason, thus:
<list>
                        <pb n="121" facs="tcp:18936:68"/>
                        <item>Who is euer vnto me, in whatsoeuer my distresses, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat sufficiencie of all comfort, strength and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: on him will I euer depend.</item>
                        <item>But the Lord is euer to me, in whatsoeuer my distresses, a compleat sufficiencie of all comfort, strength and happines, <hi>vers. 26.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>Therefore the Lord is hee, on whom I will euer depend. <hi>vers. 23.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>He yet ceaseth not: but to aduance his confidence and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing vpon the Lord, he draweth into muster a sixt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, disputed thus:
<list>
                        <item>If they who leaue and abandon thee, to rest vpon others, shall certainly perish: then will I (O Lord) euer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend vpon thee.</item>
                        <item>But they who leaue and abandon thee, to rest vpon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, shall certainly perish, <hi>vers. 27.</hi>
                        </item>

                  <p>The inscription nameth not the author of the Psalme: it no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth onely the person to whose charge it was committed
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:18936:69"/>
to be sung: and the instrument called <hi>Gittith</hi> on which it was to be sung.</p>
                  <p>Touching the Psalme it selfe: the argument is this. The Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> being through the practise and tyrannie of his enemies barred from all accesse vnto the place of the Lords publike worship and seruice (which place is called vers. 2. by the name of <hi>Tabernacles:</hi> in the 3. verse <hi>the courts of Iehoua:</hi> in the 4, <hi>Altars:</hi> in the 5. and 11, <hi>the house of the Lord</hi>) maketh this humble sute vnto the Lord:
<list>
                        <item>That he may find fauour with the Lord for his returne vnto the place of his publike worship. <hi>vers. 9.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>That this motion here set downe, is the particular solicited and vrged in this Psalme, may appeare by conferring the 9. verse with the 3. and the 11. For what he longeth for in the 3. and magnifieth in the 11: the grant of that hee doth without doubt earnestly sue for and presse in the 9: there being in the whole Psalme no other subiect, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with his intercession can properly sort and agree. But in the 3. he longeth for his returne vnto the Courts of the Lord: and in the 11, he esteemeth his presence in them, though it were but for a day and in the qualitie of a doore keeper, a matter of the greatest happines. It is therefore his repaire againe vnto the place of the Lords publike worship, for which he is an humble suter.</p>
                  <p>Now the grant of this sute the Prophet doth perswade by sundry arguments: the first whereof doth represent vnto the Lord how passionatly the Prophet doth long for his returne vnto the tabernacle: out of a perswasion on the Prophets part, that the Lord will not suffer to rest vnsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied so holy and religious a longing of his poore ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant. The conclusion is this:
<list>
                        <item>If I doe passionatly long to repaire againe vnto thy Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle, I pray thee (O Lord) let me finde fauour in thy sight for my repaire thereto.</item>
                        <item>But I doe passionatly long to repaire againe vnto thy ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle, <hi>vers. 3.</hi>

                     <pb n="124" facs="tcp:18936:70"/>The <hi>Assumption</hi> is deliuered and recorded by the Prophet in the third verse: where he protesteth in expresse termes, that his desire to returne vnto the place of the Lords worship (which place he there calleth <hi>the courts of the Lord,</hi> and likewise by the name of the <hi>Mightie and liuing God</hi>) is such as is very passionate and accompanied with an extraordinarie fainting of his soule: yea such as draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his heart and flesh, that is, his whole person into an extremitie of inward and outward crying vnto the Lord for obtaining contentment in the sute he maketh.</p>
                  <p>The said <hi>Assumption</hi> is amplified:
<list>
                        <item>1. <hi>By recommending the Lords Tabernacle by way of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, as most worthie of all loue and regard:</hi> it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the place of his presence, and where he acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his people with his mercie to them in the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah, and with his iustice against sinne.

                        </item>
                        <item>2. <hi>By noting two effects, which doe accompanie this his passionate longing to returne.</hi> With these he acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the Lord, the rather to procure from him satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in his request:

                                 <hi>The one, is a fainting and consuming of his heart with griefe during his discontinuance from the Lords house,</hi> vers. 3. in the former part.</item>
                              <item>
                                 <hi>The other, is the crying of his whole person vnto the Lord, aswell inwardly with his hart, as outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by his voyce and some humble gesture of body for obtaining a grant of his sute,</hi> vers. 3. in the later part.</item>
                           </list>
                        </item>
                        <item>3. <hi>By imparting vnto the Lord the miserie and vnhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of his present condition:</hi> the consideration where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of wrought in the heart of the Prophet a longing for some change and alteration in his present estate,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:18936:70"/>
by repayring againe vnto the holie assemblies. As if he should thus say:
<list>
                              <item>
                                 <hi>My present condition is altogether vnhappie and miserable.</hi>

                              <item>
                                 <hi>No marueile therfore if I long for a change there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of by my returne vnto the Lords house.</hi>

                  <p>The former part of this reason is not in direct termes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed by the Prophet: but in steed thereof he hath yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and set downe a cleare proofe of the same, contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning such a description of happines as is incompatible with the Prophets present estate. The proofe containing the said description is this:
<list>
                        <item>
                           <hi>They are happie who haue the libertie of accesse to thy tabernacle,</hi> vers. 5. and 6. These two verses affoord vnto vs from the consideration of the particula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities comprised in them this generall sense and description of happines. In the 5. verse, they are held for happy who haue the libertie of dwelling in the Lords house. In the 6. verse, hee is reputed happie who hath in and by the Lord the power and libertie of treading and walking in those paths which leade vnto the tabernacle. Which paths are called the Lords paths: because they are the way to the Lords house.</item>
                        <item>
                           <hi>But I haue not the libertie of accesse to thy tabernacle,</hi> vers. 4. in the end. Where I expound that interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted speech <hi>(Thy altars O Lord)</hi> in this sort: <hi>Thy altars:</hi> that is, by naming one part for the whole, Thy tabernacle is the place from whence I rest banished, and whereto I haue not libertie of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse. Which exposition doth fitly answere the comparison of little birds (as after shall appeare) deliuered in the said verse.</item>
                        <item>
                           <hi>Therefore I am not happie.</hi> This conclusion is omitted as a matter so apparant and palpable vpon the setting downe of the premisses, as it needes not any particular expressing thereof.</item>

The <hi>Dissimilititude</hi> is this:

                           <hi>But thy tabernacle is the place whereto I can haue no accesse, but rest banished from it,</hi> vers. 4. in the later part. You may see hereby how aptly the said in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt speech serueth as a reddition to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison deliuered in the former part of the verse. Neither neede wee feare that any absurditie will follow, in case the former part of the said 4. verse be interpreted as is set downe. For the tabernacle being spacious and large, and the composition thereof such as it was distinguished into sundrie parts: no marueile if little birds did find the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie of resting and breeding in some parts thereof, though not in the Sanctuarie or neere the Altar.</item>

                  <p>In the front of this Psalme there is set an inscription to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme vs of these two circumstances:
<list>
                        <pb n="132" facs="tcp:18936:74"/>

                  </p>
                  <p>The former circumstance doth aduertise vs that this Psalme is in the nature of an humble petition, as may appeare by the 12. and 13. verses: and so by the rest to the end of the Psalme.</p>
                  <p>The other doth notify that <hi>Moses</hi> was the author of the said petition. And to the end we might hold it in extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary accompt and recommendation: <hi>Moses</hi> the inditer thereof is set forth vnto vs vnder this worthie and hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable title, <hi>That he was a man of God:</hi> that is, <hi>A man both imployed by God as a great Prophet and Commaunder a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst his people, and likewise pleasing the Lord in the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his charge.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Touching the Psalme it selfe: as it is thought to haue been then indited, when the Lord had passed sentence of death against the Israelites, in regard of the discontentment and murmur they fell into vpon the relation made concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the land of Canaan, by such as were imployed in the seruice of discouering it: So it is probable that the occasion thereof grew, in that <hi>Moses</hi> discerning the reall execution of the said sentence, and the peoples anxietie and languishing thereupon, did out of a commiseration of their present estate, and withall that hee might furnish vnto them an addresse how to demeane themselues in an affliction of this qualitie, deliuer and recommend vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the people this forme of prayer. The subiect and drift whereof what it is, may appeare by drawing into consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration the 12.13.14. and 15. verses.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>Vers. 12. Hauing in the precedent verses first remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred vnto the Lord his former gracious procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with his people: and then deplored the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serie whereto they were subiect: he doth in the 12. verse intreate at the hands of the Lord such grace and direction, as whereby they may make a speciall and wise vse of the said miserie. And this he calleth <hi>numbring of our daies,</hi> and <hi>the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:18936:74"/>
of an heart of wisedome.</hi> Now this numbring of our daies is then performed and this wise hart attained vnto, when wee seriously examine and calculate all parts of the miserie incident to our daies: and so grow to repentance of heart and dependance on God. So as this is one part of the sute made here by the Prophet: namely, <hi>That the Lord would teach the people to make a wise vse of their miserie.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>Vers. 13. In this verse hee compriseth an apparant deprecation of the Lords displeasure: as if hee should say: <hi>Whereas (O Lord) thou hast in displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure against our sinnes auerted thy louing counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance from vs: I pray thee, let it now returne againe and shine on vs: change the nature of thy proceeding with vs by desisting from further afflicting vs, and by supplying vnto vs a comfortable condition of life.</hi> And this is the other part of the sute exhibited by the Prophet in this Psalme.</item>
                     <item>Vers. 14. He prayeth that the Lord would shew himself good and gracious to his people in some great measure: which he calleth <hi>a filling of vs eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie morning with his goodnesse.</hi> Now this great measure of goodnesse on the Lords part, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth in remouing their present crosse, and in sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying vnto them such an estate of life as is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable. So as this 14. verse containeth also the second part of the said prayer and sute.</item>
                     <item>Vers. 15. He soliciteth at the hands of the Lord a present recomforting and reioying of his people. Which is one and the same in sense with that which is sued for in the 13. and 14. verse. For hee meaneth that comfort and ioy of estate, which is to follow vpon the Lords retyring of his affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting hand, and yeelding vnto the people other testimonies of his goodnes. So as this verse like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise comprehendeth the second part of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets prayer.</item>

                     <pb n="134" facs="tcp:18936:75"/>By examining therefore and weighing the sense of the said verses, it appeareth that the prayer comprised in this Psalme by the Prophet <hi>Moses,</hi> is in summe this:
<list>
                        <item>That the Lord would teach the people to make a wise vse of their miserie, <hi>vers. 12:</hi> and withall supply vnto them a comfortable condition of life, <hi>vers. 13.14.15.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>The whole sute is first solicited from the beginning of the Psalme to the end of the 12. verse: and then, the later branch thereof to the end of the Psalme. The Prophets mediation with the Lord for graunt of the whole sute, is grounded vpon two seuerall inducements: the first whereof is taken from a comparison of parity, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with a testimonie of experience, and concluded thus:
<list>
                        <item>Thou hast heretofore from age to age successiuelie been gracious vnto our predecessors and vs, <hi>vers. 1. Where by this word,</hi> Habitation, <hi>the Prophet meaneth the gracious comfort and protection yeelded vnto them by the Lord.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>Therfore I pray thee (O Lord) be now likewise gracious vnto vs, namely in teaching vs to make a wise vse of our miserie, and withall in supplying vnto vs a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable condition of life, <hi>vers. 12.13.14.15.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The antecedent part of this reason hath a double amplifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: the one from a Similitude: the other from a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison of the greater to the lesse.</p>
                  <p>The Similitude is folded and closed vp in that word, <hi>habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> but being disclosed and laid foorth in his parts, will be this:
<list>
                        <item>As the house, wherein man dwelleth, doth yeeld vnto him a place of comfort and rest, as also protection against outward iniurie and extremitie.</item>
                        <item>So thy fauor (O Lord) towards our predecessors and vs, who haue had no place of habitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but haue liued in the quality of Pilgrims, hath euer furnished both vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them and vs, special comfort and protection against trouble and distresse.</item>

                     <pb n="135" facs="tcp:18936:75"/>The Comparison from the greater to the lesse is in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond verse: and discouereth vnto vs the verie originall and roote of the Lords fauourable proceeding with his people. The Comparison is this:
<list>
                        <item>
                           <hi>Thou hast been gracious vnto vs thy people before the creation of the world,</hi> vers. 2. Where by a gradation from the lesse to the greater hee expresseth the creation of the world: naming first the hils, then the earth, and lastly the whole world.</item>
                        <item>
                           <hi>No marueile then if since the creation successiuely thou hast so kindly proceeded with vs,</hi> vers. 1.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The second inducement, whereby to draw the Lord vnto a commiseration of the people, in whose fauour <hi>Moses</hi> is become an humble suter, is such as wherein hee doth by way of deploration of their present miserie, represent vnto the Lords view as it were a picture of the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wherein they were. His deploration doth particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the seuerall parts of the said miserie, and is framed in this sort:
<list>
                        <item>We thy people are subiect to death: to exceeding short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of life: to suddennes of vanishing: to great cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities: to a senselesnes of apprehending thy powerfull wrath.</item>
                        <item>It may therefore please thee (O Lord) to haue a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious commiseration of vs, in teaching vs to make an holie vse hereof, and in supplying vnto vs a comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table estate of life.</item>

                  <p>The first branch, namely that which concernes the mortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the Israelites, is declared:

                  <p>There remaineth the 5. and last branch of the misery deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the Prophet, contained in the 11. verse: where <hi>Moses</hi> by way of an interrogation doth acknowledge and admire the spirituall dulnes of heart in the people, that (considering the miserie wherein they were, and the course held by the Lord to reclaime them from wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse) yet to fill vp the measure of their miserie, and as it were in contempt of that feare of his Maiestie which the Lord laboured to worke in them, they added thereto the sinne of not apprehending how great the force and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Lords wrath is, when hee doth execute it vpon man.</p>
                  <p>Now this dulnes and senselesnes of the people in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe, is in the end of the said 11. verse amplified and made heinous, by aduertising vnto vs the meanes vsed by the Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whereby to worke in them a reuerent and sensible regard of his Maiestie. These meanes <hi>Moses</hi> calleth the Lords <hi>feare</hi>: because they were vsed by the Lord as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments to worke a feare of his Maiestie. Of this nature were the <hi>Lords promises and comminations: his signes and wonders: his proceedings in mercy and iustice.</hi> Answerably to these meanes vsed by the Lord to draw the people to a feare of his Maiestie, the people feared him not: and therefore the Prophet wondreth thereat, and confesseth
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:18936:78"/>
that none acknowledgeth the power of the Lords wrath according to his feare, that is, answerably to the meanes vsed to worke in the people a feare of his Maiestie.</p>

                  <p>Touching the <hi>Assumption</hi>: first the seuerall parts thereof are handled: and then the whole is illustrated. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part, which concernes the persecution performed by words, is declared by these two particular instances:
<list>
                        <item>They deliuer out threats of violence and oppression a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst thy people: and they speake also contemptibly of them, extolling themselues farre aboue them, <hi>ver. 4.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>The other part, which concernes the persecution performed in fact against the Lords people, is cleared likewise by certaine instances: in the setting downe whereof the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet

proceedes by a logicall gradation from the lesse to the greater, thereby to amplifie the greatnes of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution and tyrannie executed vpon the persons of the godly. The instances, whereupon the said persecution by way of fact is concluded, are these:
<list>
                        <item>
                           <hi>They vexe and oppresse thy people by sundrie vniust courses,</hi> vers. 5: <hi>they murder also the widow, the stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and the orphane,</hi> vers. 6. Here you see the said gradation. To vexe the godly by vniust courses is a great sinne. To murder them is a greater. But to vexe and murder the widow, the stranger, and the orphane, is a wickednes farre more heinous and capitall.</item>
                        <item>

                  <p>Now the said whole <hi>Assumption</hi> ioyntly with these her parts hath an illustration from this comparison:
<list>
                        <item>These tyrants persecute the Lord himselfe by disgor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging blasphemie against him, charging vpon him the imputation of ignorance and carelesnes how it suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth with the godly, <hi>vers. 7.</hi>

                  <p>Thus farre hath the Prophet solicited his sute with the Lord, concerning the execution of iustice vpon these bloodie tyrants.</p>
                  <p>There followeth the Prophets Apologie in the behalfe of the Lords glory against the said blasphemy. The blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy is this:
<list>
                        <item>That the Lord neither knoweth nor regardeth the proceedings held against the godly, <hi>vers. 7.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The wicked hauing breathed out against the Lord this blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous position; whereby they strip and depriue him of the office which is proper vnto him of gouerning and iudging the world: the Prophet doth hereupon take an occasion to accompany his humble motion with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Lords glorie. The course he holdeth in his Apology for the Lord, is this:
<list>
                        <pb n="156" facs="tcp:18936:86"/>
                        <item>
                           <hi>First, he premiseth,</hi> vers. 8. <hi>a direct contradiction to the said blasphemous position:</hi> which contradiction is implied hereby, in that he chargeth these Machi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilian gallants with extreme senselesnes for such their apprehension of the Lord: as if he said vnto them thus: It is a most grosse vntruth which you affirme of the Lords ignorance and carelesnesse touching your proceedings against the godly: so to apprehend of the Lord, argueth in you an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding blockishnes.</item>
                        <item>
                           <hi>Secondly, hauing thus censured and contradicted in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall these barbarous Machiuilists, he disputeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their blasphemie, and refelleth it by two argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. The first whereof is this:</hi>
                           <list>
                              <item>
                                 <hi>The Creator of each instrument, facultie, and act of all knowledge both in the outward sense and mind, and he who is the punisher of whole nations, doth know and take to heart your ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannous proceedings against the godly,</hi> ver. 9. and 10.</item>
                              <item>
                                 <hi>The Lord, whom you thus blaspheme, is the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of each instrument, facultie, and act of all knowledge both in the outward sense and minde: and it is hee, who is the punisher of whole nations.</hi>
                              </item>
                              <item>
                                 <hi>The Lord therefore, whom you thus blaspheme, is he who doth know and take to heart your tyrannous proceedings against the godlie.</hi> vers. 8. and 11.</item>
                           </list>
                        </item>

                  </p>
                  <p>In the Proposition are comprized (as you see) these seuerall branches:
<list>
                        <item>1. <hi>The discerning of all proceedings by him, who hath made the eare and the eye:</hi> that is, the instrument, facultie, and act of hearing and seeing, vers. 9.</item>
                        <item>2. <hi>The knowing of all proceedings by him, who hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the minde,</hi> vers. 10. in the end. Where by that one particular of the Lords teaching knowledge
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:18936:86"/>
vnto men, wee must vnderstand likewise his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the instrument, faculty, and act of this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</item>
                        <item>3. <hi>The taking to heart all proceedings against the godly by him, who is the punisher of whole nations,</hi> vers. 10. in the beginning. And this carrieth a comparison from the greater to the lesse. <hi>For if the Lord be the punisher of whole nations: what question can be made of his power and will to doe iustice vpon a few tyrants in the common-wealth of Israel?</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Assumption</hi> is omitted by the Prophet as a point vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questionable.</p>
                  <p>The Conclusion is apparantly implied, in the 8. verse: where the Prophet vnder a bitter censure and imputation of brutish dulnes laid vpon the wicked for such their phran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke conceit of the Lord, doth contradict and reiect the said blasphemie as a most grosse absurdity.</p>
                  <p>The other argument vsed by the Prophet in this his Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie for the Lords glory, is a comparison from the greater, concluded thus:
<list>
                        <item>Who knoweth the very thoughts of the wicked and the vanitie of them, he cannot but know their outward proceedings against the godly.</item>
                        <item>The Lord knoweth the very thoughts of the wicked and the vanitie of them, <hi>vers. 11. Where vnder this knowledge attributed vnto the Lord, wee must vnderstand as meant also his taking to heart such thoughts and plots as the wicked conceiue and deuise against the godly.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>Therefore the Lord cannot but know their outward pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings against the godly, <hi>vers. 8.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hitherto hath been handled, first, the Prophets humble mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for iustice against these impious oppressors of the godly: secondly, his defence of the Lords glory against their blasphemie.</p>
                  <p>His imparting of comfort vnto the godly, doth follow. For whereas the godly may obiect, that in case they bee thus
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:18936:87"/>
afflicted by the hand of the said tyrants, it may seeme that they rest in a miserable condition, such as may occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion them to doubt of the Lords prouidence &amp; to diuert their thoughtes from the rule of pietie: the Prophet in answere to the said obiection doth to the exceeding comfort of the godly, dispute this position:
<list>
                        <item>That the godly man, though afflicted by the hand of the wicked, is notwithstanding blessed, <hi>vers. 12. in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part thereof.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>This position the Prophet doth cleere and determine by two arguments: whereof
<list>
                        <item>The first is concluded thus:
<list>
                              <item>Whom the Lord by affliction teacheth his law, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shioneth to patience till the ruine of the wicked, hee, though afflicted by the wicked, is notwithstanding blessed.</item>
                              <item>But the godlie man is he, whom the Lord by affliction teacheth his law, and fashioneth to patience till the ruine of the wicked. <hi>The former effect is vers. 12. in the end: the other is vers. 13. Two excellent ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of a sanctified affliction. In the exposition of the 13. verse I follow</hi> Beza.</item>
                              <item>Therefore the godly man, though afflicted by the hand of the wicked, is notwithstanding blessed, <hi>vers. 12. in the former part thereof.</hi>
                              </item>
                           </list>
                        </item>
                        <item>The second is of this sort:
<list>
                              <item>To whom the Lords loue is constant and vnchangeable, he, though afflicted by the wicked, is notwithstanding blessed.</item>
                              <item>The godly man is he, to whom the Lords loue is constant and vnchangeable, <hi>vers. 14.</hi>
                              </item>
                              <item>Therefore the godly man, though afflicted by the wicked, is notwithstanding blessed, <hi>ver. 12. in the former part thereof.</hi>
                              </item>
                           </list>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>To the <hi>Assumption</hi> of this later Syllogisme, which concernes the vnchangeablenes of the Lords loue to the godly man, the Prophet hath yeelded this confirmation:
<list>
                        <pb n="159" facs="tcp:18936:87"/>
                        <item>If the cariage of all proceedings shall in the Lords good time be so vprightly ordered, as that the godly man shall receiue thereby what is right and due vnto him by the Lords couenant and promise: then is the Lords loue vnto him constant and vnchangeable.</item>
                        <item>But the cariage of all proceedings shall in the Lords good time be so vprightly ordered, as that the godlie man shall receiue thereby what is right and due vnto him by the Lords couenant and promise, <hi>vers. 15. Where, first it is said, that iudgement shall returne to iustice: that is, the gouernment and cariage of matters shal be reformed and reduced to a course of right. Secondly, that after it, the vpright in heart shall returne: that is, after this reformation once made, the godly shal returne, that is, partake in the fruite and benefit of the said reformation, they being to receiue thereby according to the Lords gracious promise, deliuerance fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> trouble, and such other blessed comforts.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>Therefore the godly man is he, to whom the Lords loue is constant and vnchangeable, <hi>vers. 14.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Assumption</hi> of this syllogisme (wherin it is said that the godly man shal communicate in the benefit of the Lords reformation, receiuing thereby such comforts as by the couenant and promise of mercie are due vnto him) hath a double amplification:
<list>
                        <item>1. <hi>From an instance in the Prophets owne person hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by a comparison of paritie, thus:</hi>
                           <list>
                              <item>
                                 <hi>The Lord hath giuen to me deliuerance from trouble and speciall comforts otherwise, when I was pressed with the distresses of my heart,</hi> vers. 17.18.19. In the 17. he saith: <hi>he had died, had not the Lord deliuered him.</hi> In the 18, <hi>that the Lord vpheld him when he was slipping into destruction.</hi> In the 19, <hi>that hee receiued comforts from the Lord, when an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish and distresse of heart pressed him.</hi>
                              </item>
                              <item>
                                 <pb n="160" facs="tcp:18936:88"/>
                                 <hi>Therefore the Lord will in his good time of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation giue likewise deliuerance from trouble and speciall comforts to other the godly,</hi> vers. 15.</item>
                           </list>
                        </item>
                        <item>The former part of this reason is proued and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged thus:

                                 <hi>No man affoorded vnto me this deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and comfort when the wicked practised against me,</hi> vers. 16.</item>
                              <item>
                                 <hi>It was therefore the Lord onely that did it,</hi> vers. 17.18.19.</item>

                        </item>
                        <item>2. <hi>From the consideration of the Lords most iust nature and proceeding.</hi> Hereupon the Prophet deduceth this conclusion:
<list>
                              <item>
                                 <hi>If the Lord should not so order all procedings, as that the godly man may thereby receiue what is due vnto him by the Lords promise: hee should allow the committing of iniustice vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the godly.</hi>
                              </item>
                              <item>
                                 <hi>But the Lord will not allow the committing of iniustice vpon the godly,</hi> vers. 20. Where vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an interrogatorie forme of speech it is said, that the throne of tyrannie and oppression hath no fellowship with the Lord: that is, the Lord doth renounce and detest all vniust proceedings, such as iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall thrones of that qualitie doe yeeld.</item>
                              <item>
                                 <hi>Therefore the Lord will so order al proceedings, as that the godly man may thereby receiue what is due vnto him by the Lords promise of mercie,</hi> vers. 15.</item>

                  <p>The <hi>Assumption,</hi> wherein the Lords vpright proceeding and detestation of iniustice is recommended, is made euident and cleree by a comparison: wherein is laid forth the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt the proceeding held by tyrants and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iust Iudges, and that which is held by the Lord. The first part of the sayd comparison is a description of the iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:18936:88"/>
committed by tyrannous Magistrates vpon the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and innocent thus:
<list>
                        <item>
                           <hi>They forge and contriue all wrongfull meanes whereby to defeate the course of law,</hi> vers. 20. in the end: <hi>they assemble themselues to consult and conspire vpon the ruine of the iust: they passe sentence of condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on him,</hi> vers. 21.</item>
                        <item>
                           <hi>But the eternall Lord doth protect the godly and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent: and he doth execute his wrath vpon the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,</hi> vers. 22. and 23. In the 22. verse the Prophet by a particular instance in his own person, and by naming one for all of the same kinde and nature, doth imply and note the Lords protecting of the godlie and innocent in generall. For what the Lord is vnto <hi>Dauid,</hi> as <hi>Dauid</hi> is a godly and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent man, the same the Lord is to al innocent and godly men. In the 23. verse, the Lords procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in iustice to the destruction of the wicked, is deliuered in expresse termes: and to assure vs thereof, it is thrice set downe: and to make it the more admirable and glorious, it is auouched that the Lord so ordereth his proceeding with them, as that they become the ministers and instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their owne destruction.</item>

                  <head>ANALYS. PSALM. 103.</head>
                  <p>There are of this Psalme two parts. In the former the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet doth excite and prouoke himselfe to the magnify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Lords name: from the beginning of the 1. verse to the ende of the 18. In the later hee inuiteth all other things to a concurrence with him in this duty of praising the Lord: from the beginning of the 19. verse to the end of the Psalme.</p>
                  <p>The subiect then handled in the former part is this:
<list>
                        <item>That Dauid ought with his whole heart to magnifie the name of the Lord, <hi>vers. 1. and 2.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>This subiect the Prophet doth propound vnder a forme and figure of speech addressed to his soule and to al the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties therof: therby stirring vp himself to this worthy du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of honoring the Lord, not in part or remisly, but most affectionatly and with each faculty of his mind and will. The ground and motiue inducing him to performe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord this acknowledgement and seruice of glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying his name, is (as may appeare by the latter member of the 2. verse) a suruey made by him of the Lords bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings bestowed on himselfe in particular, &amp; on the whole Church in generall. Out of this consideration he reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth and concludeth thus in honor of the Lord:
<list>
                        <item>Who hath blessed Dauid in particular, and the whole Church in generall, his name ought Dauid with his whole heart to magnifie.</item>
                        <item>But it is the Lord who hath blessed Dauid in particular, and the whole Church in generall.</item>
                        <item>Therefore the Lords name ought Dauid with his whole heart to magnifie.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Prophet first setteth downe the conclusion verse 1. and 2. Then he proceedeth to the Assumption: which consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth of two branches: The first whereof is verse 3.4.5: the second is from the beginning of the 6. verse to the end of the 18. verse.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="164" facs="tcp:18936:90"/>The first branch of the <hi>Assumption</hi> concerning the blessings bestowed vpon <hi>Dauid</hi> in particular, is declared by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, consisting partly of spirituall blessings, viz. <hi>Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication</hi> and <hi>Sanctification,</hi> verse 3: and partly of tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall fauours, verse 4. and 5. The induction is concluded thus:
<list>
                        <item>The Lord hath bestowed on Dauid pardon of sinnes and sanctification of heart: he hath deliuered him from extreame perils: he so compasseth him on euery side with his fauour, that being deliuered he shall not mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carrie by any accident at any time or place: he doth furnish vnto him in plentifull sort all needfull proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions for this life: he intertaineth him in vigor and strength of bodie for the lengthning of his daies.</item>
                        <item>Therefore the Lord hath blessed Dauid in particular.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The first member of this induction is vers. 3. Where the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of sinnes is first mentioned: and then vnder the phrase of healing thy infirmities, is implied the curing of the diseases which are in the vnderstanding and will: which being spirituall diseases, the cure is performed by the Spirit of sanctification. For it is the Spirit of the Lord that worketh vpon the vnderstanding to inlighten it with the knowledge of the Gospell, and vpon the will, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme it to some measure of obedience vnto the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell.</p>
                  <p>The second is verse 4. in the beginning: where I take it hee meaneth a temporall deliuerance, hauing in the former verse recorded his spirituall deliuerance from sin and the punishment thereof.</p>
                  <p>The third is vers. 4. in the end. Where hee noteth the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of the Lords extraordinarie care and fauour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him being deliuered, which is such as couereth him on euery side, so as he can not miscarie.</p>
                  <p>The fourth and fifth are verse 5: which verse I doe with the French and M. <hi>Beza</hi> so interpret as I haue set downe. The said fift member of the induction hath an illustration from a Comparison of Similitude, thus:
<list>
                        <pb n="165" facs="tcp:18936:90"/>
                        <item>As the bodie of an Eagle is intertained in vigor and strength, whereby it liueth long:</item>
                        <item>So the Lord intertaineth Dauid in vigor and strength to the lengthning of his age.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Prophet hauing handled the first branch of the said <hi>Assumption</hi> concerning the blessings bestowed on him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in particular, doth now in like sort by an induction specifie the benefits bestowed on the Church in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall. The induction is this:
<list>
                        <item>The Lord relieueth and righteth the cause of the oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed: he hath deliuered vnto Moses the lawes and statutes wherein his people are to walke: he hath ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured his people by his sundrie deliuerances of them: he is merciful vnto them in the pardon of their trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions.</item>
                        <item>Therfore the Lord hath blessed his whole Church in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The first member of this induction is, vers. 6.</p>
                  <p>The second and third are verse 7. This verse is so expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the French and <hi>Beza.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The fourth is vers. 8.9.10. where the Prophet with variety of phrase doth set out the excellencie and greatnes of the Lords mercie in remitting the offences of his people. That this is the maine scope of those 3. verses, may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, first by the termes and formes of speech vsed by the Prophet. Secondly, by comparing the 8. verse with that which is set downe Exod. 34.7: Numb. 14.18: Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hem. 9.17. Thirdly, by the illustration, which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet in the verses following hath yeelded vnto this point of the excellencie and greatnes of the Lords mercie.</p>
                  <p>Let vs now see how the Prophet doth handle this last mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the said induction. His purpose is (as I haue said) to make knowne vnto vs this sweete and comfortable position, viz.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>That the Lords mercie in pardoning the sinnes of his people is exceeding great.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>This point he cleereth:
<list>
                        <pb n="166" facs="tcp:18936:91"/>
                        <item>
                           <hi>First, by three comparisons of equalitie, thus:</hi>
                           <list>
                              <item>1. <hi>How great the distance of the highest heauen is from the earth: so great is the Lords mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie in being reconciled vnto those who feare him, that is, vnto his people,</hi> vers. 11.</item>
                              <item>2. <hi>As farre as the East is from the West: so far hath the Lord remooued from vs our offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> vers. 12.</item>
                              <item>3. <hi>With how great and tender compassion a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is carried towards his children: with so great and tender mercie the Lord embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth his,</hi> vers. 13.</item>
                           </list>
                        </item>
                        <item>
                           <hi>Secondly, by noting vnto vs a motiue inducing the Lord to the shewing of this exceeding mercie:</hi> which is an acknowledgement and consideration on the Lords part of the condition allotted vnto man by creation, vers. 14. A condition, in regard of the matter whereof man was formed, not onely base and contemptible, but most brittle also and apt to dissolution. By the consideration whereof the Lord is the rather moued to proceed with vs, not according to our desert in prouoking him, but according to that course which is most sutable to the glorie and excellencie of his gracious nature: that thereby he might the more magnifie the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of his mercie, being shewed vpon so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible and brittle a worme as man is.</item>
                        <item>
                           <hi>Thirdly, by remembring vnto vs the eternitie of this mercie.</hi> Which argument is concluded thus:
<list>
                              <item>
                                 <hi>The Lords mercie to his people for the pardon of their sinnes hath been from all eternitie, and doth endure for euer towards them,</hi> vers. 17.</item>
                              <item>
                                 <hi>Therefore it is exceeding great.</hi> vers. 8.9.10.</item>
                           </list>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Antecedent is amplified in this sort:
<list>
                        <pb n="167" facs="tcp:18936:91"/>
                        <item>1. <hi>By a Dissimilitude, thus:</hi>
                           <list>
                              <item>
                                 <hi>Man quickly passeth away,</hi> vers. 15. and 16. Of this sentence there is added an illustration from a double similitude: the one of grasse: the other of a flower of the field. Man is resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to either of them in this point of his speedie withering and vanishing.</item>
                              <item>
                                 <hi>But the Lords mercie to his people is eternall,</hi> v. 17.</item>
                           </list>
                        </item>
                        <item>2. <hi>By a comparison from the greater: wherein the obiect of the Lords mercie is noted, that thereby we might see the reach thereof.</hi> The comparison is this:
<list>
                              <item>
                                 <hi>The Lords mercie is extended for euer to many generations of the posteritie of his people.</hi>
                              </item>
                              <item>
                                 <hi>No marueile then if he extend it for euer to the persons of his people.</hi>
                              </item>
                           </list>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The first part of this comparison is verse 17. in the ende. Where the Prophet saith that <hi>the Lords righteousnes is vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Childrens children:</hi> meaning by <hi>righteousnesse</hi> the Lords fidelitie in keeping his couenant of mercie: and consequently the mercy performable by this couenant: which not determining in the persons of parents, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing extended also &amp; presented to their posteritie, it doth thereby discouer it selfe to be very great and excellent.</p>
                  <p>Now whereas it may be obiected that by this course of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending mercy to so many generations, it will fall out to be extended to hypocrites and impious wretches: the Prophet verse 18. doth cleare this point by a description of those, to whom the said mercy is by the Lords coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant extendable. The description of them, is
<list>
                        <item>1. <hi>From an effect on their part:</hi> viz. <hi>their obseruing of the Lords couenant made with them: which consisteth in dependance on God, &amp; in obedience to his statutes.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>2. <hi>From their perseuerance in this care and endeuour to glorifie the Lord by their faith and obedience of life.</hi> Which I take to be meant by this clause, <hi>of retaining alwaies in memorie the Lords statutes to doe them.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="168" facs="tcp:18936:92"/>Hitherto concerning the first part of the Psalme. The second followeth, wherein he inuiteth a concurrence with him in this dutie of praysing the Lord: so as the subiect hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in this second part is this:
<list>
                        <item>That all things whatsoeuer ought to concurre with Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid in praising the Lord, <hi>vers. 20.21.22.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>The argument to perswade this concurrence is concluded thus:
<list>

                           <hi>If the Lord doth by his imperiall scepter and soueraigne power gouerne all things in heauen and earth: then ought all things to concurre with Dauid in praising the Lord.</hi>

               <div type="exposition_of_Psalm">
                  <head>ANALYS. PSALM. 104.</head>
                  <p>This Psalme hath a correspondence in argument with the former. For as in the former the Psalmist prouoketh himselfe and others to magnifie the Lord: so in this hee inuiteth himself and others to the same dutie. The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the one from the other is in the qualitie of the inducements vpon which the performance of the said duty is grounded: they being such in the former Psalme as concerne the Church principally: and such in this as concerne all mankind: yea all liuing creatures. The sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect then of this Psalme is this:
<list>
                        <item>That out of a reuerent and due acknowledgement of the Lords glorie, we ought to magnifie him, <hi>vers. 1. in the beginning, vers. 31. and vers. 35. in the end.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the beginning of the first verse the Prophet addresseth personally vnto himselfe his exhortation to praise the Lord: and in his person, to all others: as may appeare aswell by the nature of the motiues to this duty alleaged by him, they being such as concerne all, as likewise by that, which is set downe verse 31. and 35. In which verses he stirreth vp others to second him in this seruice of ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring praise and honour vnto the Lord. The principall and maine ground of the said seruice is this:
<list>
                        <item>If the Lord hath in the creation of things and conserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of liuing creatures set foorth and published to the view of the world, the glorie of his power, wisedome and goodnes: then out of a due acknowledgement of this his glorie ought we to magnifie him.</item>
                        <item>But the Lord hath in the creation of things and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation of liuing creatures set foorth and published to the view of the world, the glorie of his power, wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and goodnes. <hi>From the beginning of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond verse to the end of the 30: and more sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:18936:94"/>
vers. 24. where the Prophet speaketh thus:</hi> How great are thy workes? in wisedome thou hast made them all: the earth is full of thy riches. <hi>In the first member he noteth the power of the Lord: in the second, his wisedome: in the third, his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in the number of the said workes.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>Therefore out of a due acknowledgement of this his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, ought we to magnifie him, <hi>vers. 1.31.35.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Assumption</hi> is handled by the Prophet first in the whole, by an argument drawne from the generall: then in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall parts thereof. In the whole, the handling is thus:
<list>
                        <item>
                           <hi>All thy workes doe represent and notifie to the world thy maiestie and glorie,</hi> vers. 1. Where the Prophet affirming, that the Lord is exceeding great, and that he hath clothed himself with glorie and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie, doth thereby meane that his works are this garment wherein he hath as it were imbroidered and visibly represented this his glorie. And so it is expounded by <hi>Cal. Marlo. Beza.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>
                           <hi>Therefore thy workes of creation and conseruation doe represent and publish the same.</hi> From the beginning of the second verse, to the end of the thirtith: and more summarily, vers. 24.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>Touching the handling of the said <hi>Assumption</hi> in the seuerall parts thereof: whereas the said <hi>Assumption</hi> consisteth of two parts: the one concerning the creation of things: the other, the conseruation of liuing creatures: the Prophet first disputeth that branch of creation, proouing by an induction that in the creation of things we may behold as in a mirror this glory of the Lord. The induction is concluded thus:
<list>
                        <item>
                           <hi>In the workes of the superiour part of the world, as in the light, the heauens, the clowdes and windes, the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels: likewise in the workes of the inferiour part of the world, as in the earth and the water, the Lord hath set out and proclaimed vnto vs his glorie.</hi> From the beginning of the second verse, to the end of the
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:18936:94"/>
ninth verse. What particulars are omitted in this induction, for as much as they are of the same stampe, and serue to the same purpose of repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting vnto vs the Lords glorie, they are to be conceiued as set downe to make the said induc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion perfit.</item>
                        <item>
                           <hi>Therefore hath the Lord in his workes of creation pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished and proclaimed vnto vs his glorie,</hi> vers. 24.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The first member of this induction concerning the light, is verse 2. where it is amplified by a comparison of Simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude, thus:
<list>
                        <item>As a garment doth adorne and set foorth the person who weareth it:</item>
                        <item>So the light doth discouer and set out the glorie of him who created it.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The second touching the Heauens, is also verse 2: where it is handled likewise by a comparison of similitude, thus:
<list>
                        <item>As the extending of a princely Tent doth set out the magnificencie of him whose it is:</item>
                        <item>So the extending of the heauens setteth out the maiestie of him who made them.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third is of the clowdes, vers. 3. where the clowds are described by the seruice they yeeld vnto the Lord. This their seruice consisteth:
<list>
                        <item>1. <hi>In that they serue as it were for lodgings and cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, in which and from whence the Lord doth mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest the glorie of his power, iustice, and mercie.</hi> The Prophet, Psal. 18.12. calleth the clowds <hi>the Lords tabernacles.</hi> And in the 1. of Kings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> chap. 8.12. <hi>the Lord is said to dwell in the clowds.</hi> In these clowdes the Psalmist affirmeth that the Lord hath laid the beames of his chambers: that is to say, that hee hath as it were built vnto himselfe lodgings and places, from whence to shew his glorie.</item>
                        <item>2. <hi>In that they serue also for instruments of his execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions both in the way of mercie and in the way of iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice.
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:18936:95"/>
And vpon this ground they are called the Lords chariot, out of an allusion to the ancient vse of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots in the battailes of Princes.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The fourth is of the Windes, vers. 3: where they are descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed:

                        <item>1. <hi>By their swiftnes: which is noted in that wings are attributed vnto them.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>2. <hi>By the Lords imploying of them in his seruices of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition and speede: which is implied hereby, in that the Lord is said to walke vpon their wings.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The fifth member of the sayd induction concerneth the Angels, verse 4. where they are described:
<list>
                        <item>1. <hi>By the simplenes of their essence: they being called spirits, that is, essences free from all corporall and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall composition.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>2. <hi>By the strength and agilitie of their essence (they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing called a flaming fire:) which is declared by a comparison, thus:</hi>
                           <list>
                              <item>
                                 <hi>As a flaming fire is of strength to consume, and of a qualitie speedily piercing:</hi>
                              </item>
                              <item>
                                 <hi>So the Angels are of strength to frustrate all opposition: and they doe with all nimblenes and speede pierce euery where.</hi>
                              </item>
                           </list>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The sixt is of the earth, verse 5. where wee may obserue two particulars noted by the Prophet, wherein the Lord hath imprinted a visible testimonie and marke of his glory:
<list>
                        <item>The one, the founding of the earth vpon the seas: which the Prophet calleth the bases of the earth.</item>
                        <item>The other, the stabilitie and vnmoueablenes of the earth.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The seuenth is of the waters, vers. 6.7.8.9. Where the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet obserueth these two things touching the waters:
<list>
                        <item>1. <hi>Their place in the beginning of the creation,</hi> viz. <hi>the first day.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>2. <hi>Their place in the processe of the creation,</hi> viz. <hi>the third day.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="175" facs="tcp:18936:95"/>Touching their place in the beginning of the creation: it is vers. 6. said to bee the outward superficies and face of the whole earth. Which couering of the earth by them is il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrated by two comparisons:
<list>
                        <item>1. <hi>The one, a Similitude, thus: As a garment couereth the bodie: so the waters co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered the earth.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>2. <hi>The other, a comparison from the greater, thus: The waters couered the highest hils: no marueile then if they couered lower places.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>Concerning their place in the third day of the creation: the Prophet noteth it verse 8. to be that which the Lord had assigned vnto them, viz, the sea: within the receptacle and limits whereof they are shut vp and confined: as may appeare Gen. 1.10: and Iob. 38.10. This retyring of the waters from the face of the earth into this their place, is described:
<list>
                        <item>1. <hi>By the efficient thereof:</hi> viz. <hi>the thundring voyce and commandement of the Lord,</hi> vers. 7.</item>
                        <item>2. <hi>By their speedines in retyring,</hi> vers. 7. <hi>which is noted, in that they are said to flie and to hasten away, foorth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with vpon the sense and knowledge of the Lords com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>3. <hi>By their effect of frustrating and ouercomming what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer might giue impediment to their retyring,</hi> v. 8. <hi>where it is said, that they ascended by the hils, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended by the valleis: as if the Prophet should say, That neither hils nor valleis, nor any obstacle what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer, could hinder their retyring into the place as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed vnto them.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>4. <hi>By their perpetuall residing in the place, whereinto they are retyred.</hi> vers. 9.</item>

                  <p>Hitherto of the first branch of the said <hi>Assumption</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the creation of things, and the induction vsed for the demonstration thereof.</p>
                  <p>There followes the second branch of the said <hi>Assumption</hi> concerning the conseruation of liuing creatures: from
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:18936:96"/>
the beginning of the 10. verse to the end of the 30. Here then to prooue that the Lord hath not only in his works of creation, but in other actions of his prouidence sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie represented the glory of his name to the eye of the world: the Prophet hath vndertaken to dispute this worthie position, viz.
<list>
                        <item>That the Lord by his prouidence doth conserue and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine all liuing creatures in the state of nature al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted vnto them, <hi>vers. 28.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the cleering of this position, the Prophet vseth three se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall arguments. The first containeth the meanes and instrumentall causes, whereby liuing creatures are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued and intertained. Which meanes are euery of them so many excellent workes in particular comprehended vnder that generall action of <hi>conseruation.</hi> The Prophets conclusion by vertue of this argument is this:
<list>
                        <head>Arg. 1.</head>
                        <item>The Lord hath for the vse of liuing creatures furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed vnto them the benefit of springs and riuers, the seruice of raine water, the commoditie of the night and day, the oportunitie of the sea. <hi>From the beginning of the 10. verse, to the end of the 26.</hi>

These barren and rough places are called by the Prophet <hi>high mountaines.</hi> Here wee must vnderstand that of the high mountaines, which is vers. 16. said of the high trees: namely, that they are satisfied with the raine, which falleth from the clowdes: and so are enabled to yeeld nourishment to the creatures liuing on them.</item>

                  <p>The third particular of the meanes vsed by the Lord for the conseruing and intertaining of liuing creatures, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>night and day.</hi> The <hi>night and day</hi> are described vnto vs:
<list>
                        <item>1. <hi>By noting the instrumentall causes of the distinction of the one from the other,</hi> viz. <hi>the Moone and the Sunne,</hi> vers. 19. where it is said, that <hi>the Lord hath appointed the Moone for seasons,</hi> that is, to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish the season of the night from the day: And, <hi>that the Sunne knoweth his going downe,</hi> that is, kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth a constant course of setting and rising, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the day is distinguished from the night.</item>
                        <item>2. <hi>By the vse and opportunitie they yeeld by this distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the one from the other, vnto wilde beasts and vnto men.</hi> The vse of the night for wilde beasts, is the opportunitie of trauelling abroad for their pray, vers. 20.21. The vse of the day for them, is to keepe retired and to rest, vers. 22. The vse yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to man from the day, is the opportunitie of imploying himselfe abroad in the duties of his calling from morning to euening, vers. 23. The vse of the night for man, though it be not distinctly expressed by the Prophet, yet forasmuch as it is said that man is to labour from morning to euen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, we may by good collection conceiue this vse to be the refreshment and rest of man.</item>

                     <pb n="179" facs="tcp:18936:97"/>The fourth and last particular is of the sea, verse 25. where there is a double vse thereof noted:
<list>
                        <item>1. <hi>The one, to be a receptacle for fishes,</hi> vers. 25.</item>
                        <item>2. <hi>The other, to be the subiect of Nauigation,</hi> vers. 26.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The second argument, whereby to proue that it is the Lord who doth conserue and intertaine liuing creatures, is of this conclusion:
<list>
                        <head>Arg. 2</head>
                        <item>At whose hands liuing creatures are by nature directed to attend their intertainment at all times of neede: he it is by whom they are intertained and conserued in the state allotted vnto them.</item>
                        <item>But it is the Lord at whose hands liuing creatures are by nature directed to attend their intertainment at all times of neede, <hi>vers. 27.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>Therefore it is the Lord who doth conserue and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine them in the state allotted vnto them, <hi>vers. 28.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third Argument alleaged by the Prophet for a further demonstration of the position in hand, is concluded thus:
<list>
                        <head>Arg. 3.</head>
                        <item>By whose power and vertue the perishing and reuiuing of liuing creatures in their kinde, is disposed of: by him they are intertained in the state of nature al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted vnto them.</item>
                        <item>But it is the Lord by whose power and vertue the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing and reuiuing of liuing creatures in their kind, is disposed of, <hi>vers. 29.30.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>Therefore it is the Lord by whom they are intertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the state of nature allotted vnto them. <hi>vers. 28.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus we see how the Prophet hath disputed this action of the Lords prouidence in conseruing and intertaining of liuing creatures in the condition of nature allotted vnto them. And thus we see how hee hath hitherto prooued that the Lord in the creation of things and in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation of liuing creatures, hath disclosed vnto the world the glory of his power, wisedome and goodnes: whereupon must be inferred this conclusion, <hi>That in due acknowledgement thereof we ought to honor &amp; magnifie him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="180" facs="tcp:18936:98"/>Here the Prophet stayeth not: but for a further prouocation to the tendering of this duty vnto the Lord, he vseth two other arguments: the former whereof is concluded thus:
<list>
                        <item>If we ought so to carrie our selues as that the Lord may take delight in his workes, then ought wee with praise to acknowledge the glorie of his name in them.</item>
                        <item>But wee ought so to carrie our selues as that the Lord may take delight in his workes, <hi>vers. 31. in the end.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>Therefore ought we with praise to acknowledge the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of his name in them, <hi>vers. 31. in the beginning.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Assumption</hi> is perswaded by the Prophet thus:
<list>
                        <item>The Lord is able by his power in a moment to confound whatsoeuer is offensiue and indelightfull vnto him: though it were as vnmoueable as the earth, and as strong and high as any mountaine, <hi>vers. 32.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>Therefore ought wee so to carrie our selues as that the Lord may take delight in his workes, and not repent him that he hath made them, <hi>vers. 31. in the end.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The last argument vsed by the Prophet to inforce this dutie of magnifying the Lord, is a comparison of equalitie: wherein is offered to our consideration an example and profession on the part of the Prophet, that himselfe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring life will not faile to performe the said dutie. His conclusion is this.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>As for my selfe: I professe that while I liue I will mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the Lord, <hi>vers. 33.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>Therefore let all other likewise magnifie and honour him, <hi>vers. 31.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
                  <p>The Antecedent of this reason is enlarged thus:
<list>
                        <item>If this my endeuour to magnifie the Lord, will be a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice pleasing and acceptable vnto him: while I liue will I magnifie him.</item>
                        <item>But this my endeuour to magnifie the Lord will be a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice pleasing and acceptable vnto him, <hi>vers. 34. in the beginning.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>Therefore while I liue will I magnifie him, <hi>vers. 33.</hi>

                  <head>ANALYS. PSALM. 107.</head>
                  <p>The subiect of this Psalme is this:
<list>
                        <item>That the Lord is to be magnified, first by all men in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, <hi>vers. 1.</hi> Secondly, by certaine sorts of men in particular. <hi>From the beginning of the second verse, to the end of the 42. verse.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>That the Lord is to be magnified by all men in generall, the Psalmist sheweth by this argument:
<list>
                        <item>The Lord is good, <hi>vers. 1. in the middest.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>Therefore all his people ought to magnifie him, <hi>vers. 1. in the beginning.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Antecedent of this reason is amplified by a compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son from the greater, thus:
<list>
                        <item>The Lord is good: yea (that which is a matter of greater moment and excellencie) this his goodnes doth neuer determine, but endureth eternally, <hi>vers. 1. in the end.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hauing declared that all men in generall ought to praise the Lord: he proceedeth to shew that certaine sorts of men are tyed, some of them by a proper obligation of an extraordinary mercy, &amp; some by the regard of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon blessing, to a speciall and praisefull acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lords goodnes towards them.</p>
                  <p>Let vs see vpon what particular motiue these seuerall sorts of men are to ground this their action of magnifying the Lord.</p>
                  <p>The first sort is of <hi>such as haue wandered out of their way in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts fainting through hunger and thirst,</hi> verse 2. to the end of the 9. The inducement for the performance of this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of praise by them, is concluded thus:
<list>
                        <item>Whom the Lord hath deliuered from distresse, reducing them to places of habitation, and relieuing them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the extremitie of hunger and thirst: they ought to magnifie the Lord for this his mercie both priuatly and publikely, <hi>vers. 2. and 3.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>But such as haue wandered out of their way in deserts,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:18936:100"/>
fainting through hunger and thirst, the Lord hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered from distresse, reducing them to places of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation, and relieuing them against the extremitie of hunger and thirst, <hi>vers. 4.5 6.7.9.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>Therefore such as haue wandred out of their way in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts, fainting through hunger &amp; thirst, ought to mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the Lord for this his mercy both priuatly &amp; pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely, <hi>vers. 8.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Proposition is verse 2. and 3. In these verses the whole sense of the proposition is comprehended. In the second, the action of <hi>reporting,</hi> that is, of magnifying the Lord is enioyned vnto those who are redeemed by him from di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse. In the 3. verse the particular blessings of reducing them to places of habitation and relieuing them against hunger and thirst, are noted vnder that action of gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them from the East and West, North and South. For this <hi>gathering of them from these regions,</hi> is a gathering of them vnto villages and cities: where they might find a double comfort and reliefe: the one, against wandring in deserts by the oportunitie of houses and lodgings: the other, against hunger and thirst, by the commoditie of sustenance suppliable in villages and cities.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Assumption</hi> is verse 4.5.6.7.9. In the 4 verse their wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring out of their way in deserts is noted: in the 5, their fainting through hunger and thirst: in the 6, their deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance from distresse: in the 7. their reduction to places of habitation, and consequently their reliefe against hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and thirst: in the 9, this supply against hunger and thirst, is expressed in distinct termes.</p>
                  <p>The said <hi>Assumption</hi> is in the 6. verse, enlarged by imparting vnto vs one of the causes which moued the Lord to this compassionate regard of these distressed Pilgrims: viz. <hi>their humble supplication and crying vnto the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The conclusion is vers. 8. where is enioyned a magnifying of the Lords goodnes, not only in priuate, which the Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist calleth <hi>a magnifying thereof before the Lord:</hi> but also in publike, which hee calleth <hi>a magnifying thereof before the sonnes of men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="186" facs="tcp:18936:101"/>The second sort of persons, who are obliged to this dutie of acknowledging the Lords mercy in all gratefull manner, is of <hi>prisoners whom the Lord hath enlarged from out of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</hi> The reason inducing them to offer vnto the Lord this sacrifice is this:
<list>
                        <item>By whom prisoners enlarged from out of prison haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered their libertie, him they ought to praise for his goodnes both priuatly and publikely.</item>
                        <item>But it is the Lord by whom prisoners enlarged from out of prison haue recouered their libertie, <hi>vers. 13.14.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>Therefore it is the Lord whom prisoners enlarged from out of prison, ought to praise for his goodnes both pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uatly and publikely, <hi>vers. 15.</hi>

                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Assumption</hi> is amplified by setting forth the greatnesse of this fauour and act performed by the Lord in resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring prisoners to their liberty. The amplification is:

                              <item>3. <hi>Of the cause, for which they suffered: it being no lesse than rebellion against the Lord, and a wilfull contempt of his gracious purpose to blesse them: a crime of so capitall a nature, as might iustly haue occasioned their perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall restraint,</hi> vers. 11.</item>
                              <item>4. <hi>Of the anguish they endured in mind, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of this so sharpe affliction,</hi> vers. 12. in the beginning.</item>
                              <item>5. <hi>Of their vtter destitution and desperate case, there being none to helpe them,</hi> vers. 12. in the end.</item>

                        <item>3. <hi>From the consideration of the extraordinarie course and manner of their enlargement: which by breaking the gates of steele and barres of iron is implied to be such, as if without this extraordinary power and force there had been an impossibilitie of their deliuerance.</hi> vers. 14. and 16.</item>

                  </p>
                  <p>The third sort of men, who rest bound to honour the Lord for his goodnes towards them, is of <hi>such as the Lord hath recouered from the extremitie of sicknes.</hi> The argument to perswade them to tender this seruice of thanks vnto the Lord is this:

                  <p>The conclusion is amplified by noting more distinctly than before, the circumstance of the place and persons, where and before whom this gratefull acknowledgement of the Lords mercie is to bee presented. The place must be such as is appointed for publike meetings: the persons, aswell such as are of honorable ranke and imployment in
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:18936:103"/>
the state, vers. 32. in the end: as such as are of meaner qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie and degree, verse 32. in the beginning. This serueth likewise to set out the greatnes of the blessing bestowed on these distressed trauellers on sea.</p>
                  <p>The fift and last sort of men inuited to magnifie the Lord, is of such as by a common obligation are tyed vnto this dutie: and they are such as hold a sound opinion of the Lords prouidence. For these I take to bee meant by the Psalmist verse 42. in the beginning: vnto whom are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed in the same verse, such as denie the prouidence of the Lord in the whole or in part. Now the argument whereby such, whose apprehension of the Lords proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is vpright and warrantable, are drawne to offer vnto him this dutie of praise, is taken from a suruey made of certaine changes incident to some things and persons. Out of this argument added to the consideration of the Lords proceedings aboue mentioned in the other parts of this Psalme, the Prophet deduceth first a double con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion: then, an exhortation. Of the conclusions: the one, which is the principall, concerneth directly the said fift and last sort of men, viz. such as acknowledge both the generall and particular prouidence of the Lord: the other, is touching Atheists who deny the same. The Psalmist reasoneth thus:
<list>
                        <item>The Lord, besides the euents and proceedings aboue mentioned, worketh and ordreth all changes in things and persons, as namely, barrennes and fertilitie in the earth, wealth and pouertie in priuate men, deiection and aduancement in persons of state, <hi>vers. 33. to the end of vers. 41.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>Therefore out of an obseruation of these proceedings, such as hold a sound opinion of the Lords prouidence, ought with ioyfull hearts to acknowledge and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the same: and such as are Atheists, to surcease all further dispute and replie against it, <hi>vers. 42: where the ful meaning of this double conclusion is set downe in expresse termes.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="191" facs="tcp:18936:103"/>The Antecedent of this reason compriseth sixe seuerall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, whereby to prooue that it is the Lords hand that worketh and disposeth al changes in things and persons.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The first instance is of a fruitfull soyle reduced to barrennesse,</hi> vers. 33. and vers. 34. where by <hi>flouds, and springs of waters</hi> he meaneth the soyle, which by the irrigation of waters hath growne to a qualitie of fruitfulnes. Now this change is set out by the cause which moued the Lord to the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting thereof: which is noted vers. 34. to be the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the inhabitants.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The second instance is of a barren and fruitles region made fruitfull and commodious for habitation.</hi> vers. 35.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The third is of the poore raysed to a condition of wealth.</hi> vers. 36.37.38. In these verses the Prophet setteth forth
<list>
                        <item>1. <hi>The instrumentall causes of this wealthie condition,</hi> viz. <hi>their trauell and industrie</hi>

                        <item>2. <hi>The principall cause of the said condition of wealth,</hi> viz. <hi>the blessing of the Lord, aswell vpon their persons for the multiplication of children, as vpon their stock for increase thereof,</hi> vers. 38. Where by that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular of not diminishing their cattell, we must vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand in generall the abundant increase of their whole stocke.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The fourth is of the rich reduced to a poore and miserable estate.</hi> vers. 39. Where the instrumentall causes hereof are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by these three words, viz. <hi>distresse, euill, and sorrow.</hi> Which words doe imply and signifie the crosses and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities, whereby as by meanes and instruments the Lord worketh this change of estate.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The fifth instance is of persons deiected from an high degree and state,</hi> verse 40. Where the Psalmist maketh knowne vnto vs this deiection by two particulars of abasement: whereof,
<list>
                        <pb n="192" facs="tcp:18936:104"/>
                        <item>1. <hi>The one is the Lords withdrawing from them all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, affection and dutie on the part of the people: which is an ouerture and meane to the degree of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>basement following.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>2. <hi>The other is the Lords abandoning of them to all dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfort and miserie:</hi> which is implied by this, in that they are forced to wander in deserts, as not finding so much fauour in the world as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie of a place to rest in.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The sixt and last instance is of men aduanced from a condition of affliction and basenes, to places of reputation and dignitie:</hi> and that which is more, the Lord doth honour them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus exalted with a mightie dependance: which the Psalmist doth insinuate vnder the blessing of such an issue and posteritie as shall grow into a multitude of families. verse 41.</p>
                  <p>Now the exhortation deduced vpon this argument of the changes wrought by the Lords prouidence in some things and persons, is an exhortation addressed vnto the students of true wisdome, to obserue the Lords procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings. The Psalmist perswadeth them to this dutie in this sort:
<list>
                        <item>
                           <hi>If the students of true wisedome may in the Lords pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings as in a mirrour behold his mercie and iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, then ought they to obserue them.</hi>

                        <item>
                           <hi>But they may in the Lords proceedings as in a mirrour behold his mercie and iustice,</hi> vers. 43. In this verse the Prophet mentioneth onely the Lords mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie and goodnes: but by a forme of speech wee are to vnderstand also his iustice: as may appeare by considering the instances aboue mentioned: which are instances aswell of the Lords iustice as mercie.</item>
                        <item>
                           <hi>Therefore they ought to obserue them,</hi> vers. 43. in the beginning.</item>

                  <head>ANALYS. PSALM. 116.</head>
                  <p>The Prophet in this Psalme hath deliuered a profession of his thankfulnes vnto the Lord for his gracious mercie shewed in freeing him from the distresse and perill of death whereto hee was subiect being pursued by <hi>Saul.</hi> This his thankfulnes he doth expresse by two seuerall du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: the one, <hi>of louing the Lord,</hi> verse 1: the other, <hi>of testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying this loue by a publike acknowledgement of the Lords mercie towards him in his deliuerance,</hi> vers. 13.14. The subiect then of this Psalme is this:
<list>
                        <item>I loue the Lord, and will testifie asmuch by my gratefull ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement in publike of his mercie towards mee in my deliuerance from death. <hi>vers. 1.13.14. and repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, vers. 17.18.19.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>The Psalmist doth expresse his profession of acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lords mercie towards him, vnder a varietie of phrase and seuerall formes of speech. In the 13. verse he calleth it, <hi>the taking of the cup of deliuerance.</hi> For vnder the law, those whom the Lord had deliuered from some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie distresse, did vse in a solemne banket to take the cup and drink, making a publike and thankfull ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of the deliuerance, which they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued by the hand of the Lord. In the same 13. verse, it is termed, <hi>the extolling of the Lords name.</hi> In the 14. verse, it is called <hi>the paying or performing of vowes:</hi> which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance was an apparant testimonie that the author of them being deliuered, did out of a gratefull hart confesse the Lord to be his deliuerer. In the 17. verse, it is named <hi>the offering of the sacrifice of prayse:</hi> So as these seuerall formes of speech are so to bee conceiued of, as interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and importing one and the same action of acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:18936:105"/>
with a thankfull hart the Lords mercie. Which the Psalmist professeth to perfome in publike. For affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming that he will performe this dutie before all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in the courts of the Lords house, in the middest of Ierusalem: what else can he meane but the performance of the said dutie in publke?</p>
                  <p>Let vs now see the ground and inducement of this gratefull and worthie profession made by the Prophet: which is this:
<list>
                        <item>When I called vpon the Lord in my distresse, hee heard and deliuered me, <hi>vers. 1.2.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>Therefore I loue him, and will testifie as much by my gratefull acknowledgement in publike of his mercie towards me in my deliuerance, <hi>vers. 1.13.14. Also vers. 17.18.19.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>The whole Psalme consisteth of these two sentences: in the Antecedent whereof the Prophet hath comprised these branches:

Where the said instance is repeated for an ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clusion: the Prophet reasoning thus: The Lord hath in former times been bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall vnto me in deliuering me from trouble, vers. 7. in the end.

                        <item>1. <hi>The cause of this distrust,</hi> viz. the passion which transported and astonished him vpon the sense of his present affliction, vers. 10. in the end. Where the Prophet speaketh thus: <hi>When I was exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly troubled,</hi> that is, when passion and griefe procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from the feeling of my present distresse and desperate case, possessed my heart, &amp;c.</item>
                        <item>2. <hi>The time when he fell into it,</hi> viz. when he fled in all haste from the presence of <hi>Saul,</hi> vers. 11. in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning.</item>
                        <item>3. <hi>The effect wrought by the said distrust,</hi> viz. an incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderate and scandalous censure of the promise deliuered vnto him by <hi>Samuel,</hi> vers. 11. in the end. Where by affirming in generall that euery man is a liar: wee must vnderstand that in particular he chargeth the Prophet <hi>Samuel</hi> therewith: and so meaneth that the promise, which <hi>Samuel</hi> deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red touching his aduancement to the Scepter and Crowne of Israel, was delusorie and vaine.</item>

                  </p>
                  <p>The Prophet hauing hitherto, namely from the 3. verse, to
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:18936:107"/>
the end of the 11, handled that branch of the said Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent, which concernes his calling vpon the Lord in his distresse: he doth now proceede vnto the second, viz. <hi>the Lords hearing and deliuering of him.</hi> This branch he hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth thus:
<list>
                        <item>Who are the Lords beloued children, their life, as being deare and pretious in his sight, he deliuereth from death, <hi>vers. 15.</hi>

                        <item>But I the Prophet am one of the Lords beloued chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, <hi>vers. 16. in the former part of the verse.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>Therefore I am one, whose life, as being pretious in the Lords sight, he hath deliuered from death, <hi>vers. 16. in the end.</hi>

                  <p>Thus far concerning the said Antecedent and the seuerall branches thereof. The conclusion inferred vpon the said Antecedent is (as hath bin shewed) <hi>Dauids</hi> profession of louing the Lord, and of testifying so much by his grateful acknowledgement in publike of the Lords mercy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him. Now to yeeld vnto this worthie conclusion some ornament and amplification, that is to say, to set forth the greatnes of the Lords fauour vnto him in this case of his deliuerance, and withall his owne readines to acknowledge it: hee hath entied a dispute with himselfe what course he is to hold of requitall vnto the Lord. His dispute is this:
<list>
                        <item>I must acknowledge the Lords kindnes either by way of praise and thankes vnto him, or by some reall satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and offer.</item>
                        <item>But I rest vnable to acknowledge the Lords kindnes by any reall satisfaction and offer, <hi>vers. 12. in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning. Where by an interrogatorie speech of what he should render vnto the Lord, he confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth his disabilitie and insufficiencie in that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>Therefore I will acknowledge it by way of praise and thankes, <hi>vers. 13.14. and vers. 17.18.</hi>

<pb n="199" facs="tcp:18936:107"/>
the reason of his disabilitie to performe an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of that nature. The reason hereof hee concludeth thus:

                        <item>
                           <hi>The fauour thou hast shewed me in my late deliuerance is infinitly great,</hi> v. 12. in the end. Where the Prophet saith: <hi>All thy benefits are vpon me.</hi> As if he said, I value thy fauour in this my late deliuerance at so high a rate, as if thou haddest conferred vpon me all the blessings in the world.</item>
                        <item>

                     <hi>Dauid</hi> hauing made protestation that he hated and pursued his enemies, not out of humor and passion, but out of a respect to the Lords glorie: and being now charged by
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:18936:108"/>
them with the odious imputation of hypocrisy, as if vnder the pretext of pietie and zeale he conueyed the sting of malice and reuenge, doth for his clearing in this behalfe, appeale vnto the Lord, humbly submitting his said pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation and the cariage of himselfe towards his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to his vnpartiall examination and triall. His appeale is deliuered in the two last verses of the Psalme: and is in effect this:
<list>
                        <item>That the Lord would be pleased to examine and iudge whether his carriage towards his enemies be such as wherewith they charge him, <hi>vers. 23.24.</hi>

                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the 23. verse he desires that his thoughts, that is, the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of his heart and the proceeding which hath issued from thence may be examined, whether in this question of hating and pursuing his enemies, they be of such qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie as is obiected. In the 24. verse, hee doth more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly expound his appeale, in that he prayeth examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may be taken, whether in the cariage of his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons towards his enemies hee hath had any deseigne and purpose of wronging and molesting them. As the French interpreteth it. And so closeth vp his appeale with this sute, viz. <hi>That the Lord would guide him in the way of the world:</hi> that is, <hi>that the Lord would guide and support him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the troubles and crosses of this world.</hi> For so <hi>the way of the world</hi> may answerably to <hi>Dauids</hi> present condition be expounded.</p>
                  <p>Now in this appeale the Prophet holdeth this course:
<list>
                        <item>1. <hi>He rendreth the reason of his appeale vnto the Lord:</hi> from the beginning of the first verse to the end of the 18: interlacing in two seuerall places his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement and praise of the Lords wisedom and power.</item>
                        <item>2. <hi>He doth exhibit a summarie declaration of his cause, thereby as it were to informe the Lord.</hi> From the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the 17. verse to the end of the 22.

                     <pb n="202" facs="tcp:18936:109"/>The reason of tendering his appeale vnto the Lord is this, and concluded by him thus:
<list>
                        <item>O Lord: the whole carriage of my life is perfitly knowne vnto thee, <hi>vers. 1.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>Wherefore I pray thee examine and iudge whether my carriage towards mine enemies be such as is char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, <hi>vers. 23.24.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The first part of this reason is illustrated first by an indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: thus,
<list>
                        <item>My outward actions, my inward thoughts, my words are knowne vnto thee, <hi>vers. 2.3.4.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>Therefore the whole carriage of my life is in euery re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect and perfitly knowne vnto thee, <hi>vers. 1.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The first member of the said induction concerning the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets outward actions, is set downe verse 2. in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: and repeated verse 3. In which verses vnder the termes of <hi>sitting, rising, going and lying,</hi> euery outward pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding held by the Prophet is noted: which in the ende of the third verse is implied by this generall: <hi>Thou vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandest al my waies,</hi> that is, <hi>all my actions and courses.</hi> Or, <hi>thou art accustomed to all my waies:</hi> which is in sense all one with the former.</p>
                  <p>The second member of the induction touching the Lords knowledge of the Prophets thoughts, is vers. 2. implied vnder a comparison of the greater, thus:
<list>
                        <item>Thou knowest my thoughts before they be conceiued and formed in my heart, <hi>vers. 2. in the end. Where it is said:</hi> Thou knowest my thought a farre off: <hi>that is, thou knowest my thought, and thou knowest it long before it be formed.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>No marueile then if thou know my thoughts being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued once and formed in my heart.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third member of the induction concerning the Lords knowledge of the Prophets words, is likewise implied vnder a comparison from the greater:
<list>
                        <pb n="203" facs="tcp:18936:109"/>
                        <item>Before I forme and pronounce my words, thou doest per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitly know them, <hi>vers. 4.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>No marueile then if thou know them being formed and pronounced.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, the Lords knowledge of the Prophets whole ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of his life is further declared by this argument:
<list>
                        <item>
                           <hi>If by any thing I may deceiue and disappoint thy know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the cariage and traine of my life, it is by some thing that can hide me from thy sight and presence.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>
                           <hi>But nothing can hide me from thy sight and presence:</hi> vers. 5. In the 5, this sentence is expressed by these two particular formes of speech. The first is, that the Lord doth besiege or compasse the Prophet on euery side, behinde, before, aboue, below, &amp;c. As if he should say: Howsoeuer I dispose of my selfe, or whither soeuer I turne, I remaine alwaies within thy sight and presence. The second is, that the Lord laieth his hand vpon the Prophet: as if he said: Thy hand, or thy prouidence, is euer vpon me to hold me within the compasse of thine eye, so as I can in no place and at no time escape thy sight.</item>
                        <item>
                           <hi>Therefore I can by nothing deceiue and disappoint thy knowledge of the cariage and traine of my life: so as it is in euery respect perfitly knowne vnto thee,</hi> vers. 1. and 6. In the translation and exposition of the 6. verse I follow <hi>Tremellius,</hi> who readeth it thus: <hi>Thy knowledge is more wonderfull (or greater) than my abilitie is to deceiue it: it is high, or excellent: I am not able to preuaile ouer it, or goe beyond it.</hi> And this translation doth best fit the argument in hand.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>To the <hi>Assumption</hi> the Prophet hath yeelded this proofe:
<list>
                        <item>
                           <hi>No place or time of darknes can hide me from thy sight and presence,</hi> vers. 7. and vers. 11.12. In the 7. verse it is said in plaine and expresse termes, that no place can hide him from the Lords spirit &amp; face:
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:18936:110"/>
that is, from the Lords knowledge and eye. In the 11. and 12. verse hee confesseth likewise, that no darknes whatsoeuer can keep him from the Lords sight.</item>
                        <item>
                           <hi>Therefore nothing can hide me from thy sight and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,</hi> vers. 5.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The first member of the Antecedent, namely, <hi>that no place can hide him from the Lords eye,</hi> hath this illustration:
<list>

                           <hi>If I can retire into no place of the heauen, of the earth, and of the sea, wherein thou art not present: then no place can hide me from thee.</hi> The Prophet in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culating these places, doth in generall meane any place of the world whatsoeuer.</item>
                        <item>
                           <hi>But I can retire into no place of the heauen, the earth, or the sea, wherein thou art not present,</hi> vers. 8.9.10. In the tenth verse, the Lords presence and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is noted by an action attributed vnto him of guiding and laying hold vpon the Prophet, in case he retired into the vtmost limits of the sea.</item>
                        <item>
                           <hi>Therefore no place can hide me from thee,</hi> vers. 7.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>Touching the <hi>Assumption</hi> of this later syllogisme: Whereas verse 8. the Prophet speaketh thus: <hi>If I lie downe in the graue, thou art there:</hi> we must by <hi>the graue</hi> vnderstand the most secret and hidden part of the earth: and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently any place of the earth whatsoeuer. So likewise verse 9. by the vtmost limits of the sea, wee are to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the most retired angle of the sea: and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly any place of the sea whatsoeuer. And in the same 9 verse by <hi>taking the wings of the morning,</hi> we must vnderstand the running of that course which the Sunne runneth. The morning is an effect proceeding from the light of the Sunne: and so by a forme of speech is taken for the Sun, or the beames of the Sunne. The Prophets meaning is this: <hi>If I should run the course of the Sun and lodge in the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most parts of the sea: thither also shall thy hand guide me, and there shall it lay hold on me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The second member of the said Antecedent, namely, <hi>That
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:18936:110"/>
no darkenes can hide me from thy sight,</hi> is brought in by the Prophet in the beginning of verse 11, vnder the forme of an obiection: and hath this confirmation:
<list>
                        <item>If darknes will serue thee for the discouerie of all things aswell as the light, the one and the other being for this vse all one vnto thee: then no darknes can hide me from thy sight.</item>
                        <item>But darknes will serue thee for the discouery of all things aswell as the light, the one and the other being for this vse all one vnto thee, <hi>vers. 11. in the end, and verse 12. in the end.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>Therefore no darknes can hide me from thy sight, <hi>verse 12. in the beginning: and this is also implied in the obiection set downe vers. 11. in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: where the Prophet speaketh thus:</hi> If I should say: happily the darknes will couer and hide me: <hi>meaning hereby that it were madnes so to conceiue of the darknes, and to make this obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction thereupon.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the Lords<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> knowledge of the Prophets whole ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of his life is disputed thus:
<list>
                        <item>
                           <hi>Thou doest by thy soueraigne and effectuall prouidence dispose of my heart,</hi> v. 13. in the beginning. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in this verse the Lord is said to possesse the reines of the Prophet: as wee are by the name of <hi>reines</hi> to vnderstand the Prophets heart: so by the Lords possessing himselfe of them wee are to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the Lords absolute power in gouerning them, and his perfit knowledge of them.</item>
                        <item>
                           <hi>Therefore the deseignes of my heart and the cariage of them must needs be exactly knowne vnto thee,</hi> vers. 1.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Antecedent is demonstrated thus:
<list>
                        <item>
                           <hi>Thou art he who hath formed me in my mothers wombe,</hi> vers. 13. in the end. In reading this whole verse I follow the Geneuian translation: taking this la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of the verse as seruing both to prooue the former: and to occasion the Prophet to fall into
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:18936:111"/>
an action of magnifying the Lord.</item>
                        <item>
                           <hi>Therefore thou art he who disposeth of my heart by thy soueraigne and effectuall prouidence,</hi> vers. 13. in the beginning.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here the Prophet, before hee proceede further, doth out of an admiration of the Lords infinit power and wisedome shewed in forming him, breake forth into an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement and extolling thereof, vers. 14. In the interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of which verse I follow the French. The Prophets magnifying of the Lord in this behalfe, is concluded thus:
<list>
                        <item>Thou hast shewed thy selfe in forming me to be of an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable wisedome and power, <hi>vers. 14. in the midst. Where it is said:</hi> Thou hast made me after a strange and wonderfull manner.</item>
                        <item>I doe therefore in this regard honour and magnifie thee, <hi>vers. 14. in the beginning.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The former part of this reason is enlarged thus:
<list>
                        <item>I doe obserue and also acknowledge with my heart that thou shewest thy selfe to be of an admirable power and wisedome in all other thy workes, <hi>vers. 14. in the last part of the verse. Where it is said:</hi> Marueilous are thy workes: and my soule &amp;c.</item>
                        <item>Therefore I marueile not if thou shew thy selfe alike ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable in this particular work of my formation, <hi>verse 14. in the middest.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Prophet hauing vpon the occasion remembred, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished his acknowledgement and praise of the Lords sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular power and wisedome shewed in the forming of him, doth now returne to a further demonstration <hi>of the Lords knowledge touching the cariage and proceedings of his whole life.</hi> He reasoneth from a comparison, thus:
<list>
                        <item>I was knowne vnto thee when my bodie was fashioning in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a distinct forme and proportion: nay, when I was a masse vndistinguished and formelesse: and which is more, from all eternitie, <hi>vers. 15. and 16. Where I fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the French.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>
                           <pb n="207" facs="tcp:18936:111"/>No marueile then if now thou know the cariage of all my deseignes and proceedings.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Antecedent containes (as you see) a gradation from the lesse to the greater.</p>
                  <p>The first branch of the said gradation is verse 15. where the Prophet sets out the Lords fashioning of his bodie into a distinct forme:
<list>
                        <item>1. <hi>By the place where it is fashioned,</hi> viz. <hi>in the mothers wombe:</hi> which is resembled to an hidden place, and to the lowest parts of the earth. Vnder this particular of fashioning his bones, we must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue to bee meant the forming of his whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die.</item>
                        <item>2. <hi>By the admirable workmanship thereof, such as no skill or industrie of imbroderer, or other artificer can at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vnto.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The second branch of the said gradation is verse 16. in the beginning. <hi>Thine eyes saw me when I was a lumpe or masse without forme.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third is in the other part of the said 16. verse. Where the Prophet affirmeth that <hi>all these things were written in the Lords booke, and the daies wherein they were formed, euen then when none of them was.</hi> That is, as <hi>Beza</hi> expoundeth it, <hi>this my fashioning and the time assigned thereto, were set downe in the booke of thy eternall decree and prouidence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that any part of this workmanship of my bodie was made.</hi> By this it appeares that the Lord did from all eternitie know the worke he was to make.</p>
                  <p>Here againe, vers. 17. and 18. the Prophet out of an obserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made of the Lords knowledge of all things from all eternitie, as likewis<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> of his admirable wisedome and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer shewed in the course of his prouidence towards man, breakes forth into an action of magnifying the Lords proceedings in generall. The arguments vsed by him to this purpose doe note vnto vs two seuerall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuncts of his proceeding, viz:
<list>
                        <pb n="20" facs="tcp:18936:112"/>
                        <item>1. <hi>Their incomparable excellencie,</hi> vers. 17. in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. Where it is said: <hi>How pretious or excellent are thy thoughts vnto me?</hi> That is I do reckon and esteeme of thy proceedings for such as are most worthie and excellent.</item>
                        <item>2. <hi>The infinitenes of their number,</hi> vers. 17. in the end.</item>

                  </p>
                  <p>That the Lords proceedings doe exceed in number, is shewed
<list>
                        <item>1. <hi>By a comparison from the lesse, thus:</hi> vers. 18. in the beginning.
<list>
                              <item>
                                 <hi>The sands of the sea are innumerable.</hi>

                              <item>
                                 <hi>But the proceedings of thy prouidence are more in number.</hi>
                              </item>
                           </list>
                        </item>
                        <item>2. <hi>By an effect which euery new meditation of the Lords proceedings doth worke:</hi>
                           <list>
                              <item>
                                 <hi>Euery new and reiterated meditation of thy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings doth yeeld new matter and argument of thy praise,</hi> vers. 18. in the end. Thus doe <hi>Caluin</hi> and <hi>Beza</hi> expound the last clause of the 18. verse: <hi>When I awake, I am still with thee.</hi>
                              </item>
                              <item>
                                 <hi>Therefore thy proceedings must needes exceed in number,</hi> v. 18. in the beginning: and v. 17. in the end.</item>
                           </list>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hitherto the reason of the Prophets appealing vnto the Lord hath bin disputed and handled by foure seuerall ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments.</p>
                  <p>Now followeth his exhibiting of the declaration of his cause, thereby as it were to informe the Lord. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of his cause, wherein he sheweth what hee hath to pleade for himselfe against the slanderous charge of his enemies, is comprised by him in this syllogisme:
<list>
                        <item>
                           <hi>Who are thy professed enemies, those I may iustly hate and hold for mine enemies,</hi> ver. 21. Where the Lords professed enemies are noted vnder the title and name of such as hate him and rebell against him.</item>
                        <item>
                           <pb n="209" facs="tcp:18936:112"/>
                           <hi>But the wicked (who slanderously charge me) are thy professed enemies,</hi> vers. 19. and 20.</item>
                        <item>
                           <hi>Therefore these wicked men are those whom I may iust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hate and hold for mine enemies,</hi> vers. 22. Where the Prophet saith, <hi>that he hateth them with a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect hatred,</hi> that is, with a iust and sincere hatred, an hatred not grounded vpon sinister and malitious respects, but free from them. This exposition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees with the drift of the Prophet: who was charged to hate and pursue the wicked out of an humour of malice and spleene.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The proposition and conclusion of this syllogisme are (as you see) clearely set downe.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Assumption</hi> likewise, though it bee not in these distinct termes expressed: yet is it by the Prophet in effect and sense euidently proposed: there being in liew of the said <hi>Assumption</hi> deliuered a very apparant proofe and illustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof vnder a description of the wicked: which is such as doth plainly detect and discouer them to bee the professed and capitall enemyes of the Lord. The descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is this:
<list>
                        <item>1. <hi>These wicked wretches deserue vtter destruction,</hi> vers. 19. in the beginning. Which iudgement the Prophet would not wish vnto them, vnlesse they were the Lords enemies.</item>
                        <item>2. <hi>They are oppressors and murderers of thy people,</hi> v. 19. in the middest, where they are called <hi>men of blood.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>3. <hi>They are such whose societie is to be renounced and abhorred, as of men vnworthie to tread on the earth,</hi> vers. 19. in the end.</item>
                        <item>4. <hi>They deliuer wicked speeches of thee,</hi> v. 20. in the beg.</item>
                        <item>5. <hi>They doe magnifie (though causelesly) thy enemies proceedings,</hi> vers. 20. in the end. Where it is sayd, <hi>they extoll the Lords enemies,</hi> that is, their deseignes and proceedings: which cannot bee without a speciall approbation of them and concurrence with the plotters thereof.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="210" facs="tcp:18936:113"/>You see now by these fiue particulars how the Prophet hath painted out these wicked wretches (of whom the questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is in this Psalme) for such as are the mortall and mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious enemies of the Lord: so as the full and perfect mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the said <hi>Assumption</hi> is plainly and sensibly deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered.</p>
                  <p>There resteth the close of this Psalme: which is an humble sute wherewith the Prophet doth accompany his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale. The sute is this:
<list>
                        <item>That the Lord would be pleased to guide and support him amongst the troubles and crosses of this world, <hi>ver. 24. in the end.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>The occasion of this motion is the course held by the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked in pursuing the Prophet with scandalous and malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous imputations. This motion is propounded only, and not vrged.</p>
