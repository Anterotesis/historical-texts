            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lmightie God and most merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Father, I see in thy blessed lawes and commaundementes, the greatnesse of my sinnes and wickednesse: yea, I see (O Lord my god) the whole course of my life to be almost nothing els, but a continuall brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of thy holy lawes and commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dements. The thoughts of my harte, either in vanitie, or els open wickednesse, are in number infinite, daily in the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundance of them, causing my mouth to speake, &amp; my body to execute and do contrary to thy holy will. And againe (O Lord) I see thy heauie wrath, vengea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, and iudgment against sinne to be intolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, that euen the least wicked thought and most secreat cogitation of my harte, procureth thy heauy wrath, and euerlasting curse, the tormente of hell, and euerlasting fire, euen although I had but once in all my life broke any of thy commaundements, so much as once in thought. And I know (O Lord God) that thou art true and iust, &amp; canst not abide sinne and wickednesse, but wilt iustly punish euerie sinne, euen with the selfe same tormentes of hell whiche thy iustice hath appointed, euen for euery

sinne. This O Lord my God throweth me downe and euen amaseth me, so that I knowe not what to do. I looke into my selfe, vewing mine owne pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, whither I am able to ouercome this punishment of my sinne or no: and I see that al eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite punishment which I can deuise to my selfe, in whipping of my body as long as I liue, wearing haire cloth, pineing my selfe with fasting, or any other paine, I see, I see (O Lorde) that all this pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is not sufficient for one of my least sinnes because it deserueth euen the euerlasting paines of hell. I looke to Heauen, I see there is no Sainte nor Angel able to abide and ouercome this punishment of sinne: I looke to men in this worlde, euen to the Popes treasure, that wicked man of sinne, and I see y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> neither his masse nor purgatory, pilgrimage, pardons, penance, satisfactions, nor any of suche like wicked stuffe, alas I see they are nothing for the satisfying for one of my least wicked thoughts, seeing the punishmente is by thy iuste decree and sentence thine euerlasting cursse. Wherefore I am driuen out from my selfe, and all that I can do, to seeke this punishmente discharged other where, or else to quall vnder the burthen. I see there is no healpe for me in Angels, Saintes, nor mortall men, but onelie in that perfecte man Christe Iesus thy deere sonne, in whome I see the full punishment of my sinne wholy payd, satisfied, discharged, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome: death vanquished, the paines of hel in vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie swalowed vp, the curse satisfied, and the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of the punishmente (through his euerlasting

This I see (O Lord) by the eyes of faith, being through thy holy spirite wholy assured, that all the whole punishment of sinne payd by my Sauiour Christ, is not onely payd for other men, but euen also for me and my sinne. This assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of my faith, being thine onely woork in me, I beseech thee in mercy to strengthen &amp; increase, for I feele it often ful of wauering &amp; doubting. Graunt that I may daily more and more in my soule and conscience, feele my selfe knit and grafted into the body of thy sonne, whereby I may be assured, that whatsoeuer He hath done, pertaineth to mee, and is fully &amp; wholy mine: that I may through the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of his death, feele daily sinne die in me, and tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough the power of his resurrection feele my selfe risen from sinne, to haue my full ioy and comforte in those things which be agreeable to thy holy wil, vtterly detesting, hating, and abhorring from my hearte althinges which be contrarie to thy will and pleasure: that euen in this life I may still looke for this endlesse ioy and felicitie, vsing the thinges of this worlde, as though I vsed them not, till that good time that it shall please thee to call mee to thine euerlasting Kingdome of Glorie, there to reigne with my Lord and Sauiour Iesus Christ for euer and euer.

               <p>O Heauenly Father, what soeuer I am, what so e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer I haue, whatsoeuer I know, it is only by thy free grace. For by nature I am the childe of wrath, and I am not borne a newe of fleshe and bloude, neither of the seede of man, or of the will of man. Fleshe and bloude cannot reueale the mysteries of thy Heauenly Kingdome vnto mee: but by thy blessed will I am that I am, and by the same knowe I that I knowe. Therefore, O Father, do I commit into thy handes onely, my saluation. If my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge bee small, yet I doubte nothing but that I am the childe of thy euerlasting kingdome: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by thy mightie power I shall growe (when it shall bee thy good will and pleasure) to a more full and riper knowledge, as of a more perfecte age, wherein my faith shal bee fully able to comprehend and perceiue the breadth, deapth, heigth and large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of thy greate mercies and gratious promises. But seeing, O Father, this power of full knowledge and perfecte reuelation, passeth all power naturall, and remaineth onely in thy power, and the light of thy spirite: O Lord do thou whatsoeuer it shall please thee, to open vnto me and all the rest of thine elect seruaunts and children, depending vppon thee, so muche of the lighte of thy countenaunce as may be moste for thy Glorie and our comforte, yea, and at suche time as shall seeme good to thy wisedome

&amp; fatherly mercie. In the meane while thus resting wholy vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thee, neither can I despaire, neither wil I be to much careful, althogh I cannot attaine to the knowledge of many of thy works, neither to the vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>derstanding of many places of thy scriptures. But I will confesse vnto thee the weakenesse of my faith, waiting alwais for the further reuealing of thy glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious light to be vttered vnto me thy poore seruant, when thou shalt thinke (of thy fatherly beneuolence and goodnesse) meete and conuenient. I knowing moste assuredly that thou wilt pitie my weake im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becillitie and childishe infancie, and cause the same to serue for thy glorie, and my greate commoditie: seeing that I erre as a childe before suche a Father, which canst not put off thy fatherly pitie and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion, but rather as thou haste bought mee vnto thee, to be an heire of the kingdome by the bloud of thy naturall sonne my Sauiour Iesus Christ: so am I sure that thou wilt lighten me in the end with full fruition of the brighte lighte of thy countenaunce, that I may see thee and know thee as this thy sonn knoweth thee: yea, see thee and knowe thee my Father face to face, and knowe as I am knowen. Thus reste I onely in thy handes (O my God) cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of thee to increase my knowledge in thy ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly woorde, wherby I may know thy good wil and pleasure. And knowing the same, giue me, O Lord thy holie Spirit to conduct &amp; leade me in the same al the dayes of my life, that in sinceritie of faith, and purenesse of liuing and conuersation, thy glorious Maiestie may be magnified in me for euer.

               <p>Moreouer, wee thanke thee (O Lord) for that it hath pleased thee to bee the watche man, and as it were the spie of this Churche &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth, and haste foreseene all the stormes, and treasons comming against it, and againste thine annoincted our Souereigne who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e thou in mercy hast appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to rule ouer it, and haste scattered them and broughte them to noughte, and haste pursued cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of thine enimies and oures vnto death, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeching thee to continue this watchful and careful eye ouer vs, still to do vs good, and to pursue the rest of thine enimies and oures vnto the graue gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing notwithstanding repentance vnto them, vnto whome thou haste lefte place of repentance. And to this ende, raise vp the heartes of our moste Gratious Queene and her honourable Counsell thy Magistrates, that as they sitte in thy seate, and are called by thy Name, so they may execute thy iustice, which thou so wel approuest of, wherof al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so thou wilte require a streighte accompte at their handes. Wee desire thee also to shewe these thy Graces to all other Churches of thine, namely thy Churche of Scotlande, that it may enioy that peace that thou haste giuen it: and graunte that the same bee referred to that end wherefore thou haste giuen it: namely, to the full establishmente of the throne of thy deere Sonne our Sauiour Iesus Christe, and to the building of his Kingdome there. Wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeche
<pb facs="tcp:5592:30"/>
thee also for the Churches, which thy hand hathe planted long since: especially those, from whome we haue receiued knowledge in time of our ignorance, places of refuge in time of persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: that it would please thee to continue thy lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing kindenesse towardes them, and therfore cause them to continue their faith towardes thee, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience towardes thy holy Word. And whenso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer it shalbe thy pleasure, to trie them with any kinde of affliction, it woulde please the to graunt vnto them, that they may put their trust in thee, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing regard to the trueth of thy promises, and to the good experience that they haue of thy helpe in times past, and thereby conceiue comforte &amp; hope (O Lord) euen of life in deathe, and of Saluation in destruction. We pray the also (good Lord) that we may haue the feeling of the miseries of our Brethren, as members of the same bodie, and those that liue by the same Spirite. And therefore we pray thee, that according to the manifolde troubles that thou shalt visite them with, it woulde be thy good pleasure, to measure out thy grace in suche plentiful manner, that thy children may patiently beare, &amp; ioyfully attend, for the good houre wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thou wilt pull them out of al their troubles. And especially wee pray thy Maiestie for our Brethren that are afflicted for thy Gospel sake: namely, those that suffer imprisonment or otherwise in any na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for the clearer testimonie of it: that it woulde please thee to giue them patience in all their trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, wisdome and mouthes to defende thy cause,
<pb facs="tcp:5592:31"/>
against all those that rise vppe against it: that thou wouldest blesse their trauels and sufferings for that, for whiche they are taken: which is, to giue a freer course of thy Gospell into all places. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal we beseech thee for the churches of Fraunce and Flaunders, whiche are so miserably racked and torne in sunder, and whiche are almoste consumed with these fiery trials: that it would please thee to looke vpon their sighings and groneings, the teares that fal from their eies continually, the bloud that is shed in al parts of the land, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bodies that lie vnburi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to be meate to the foules of the ayre, and Fishes of the Sea, the lonenesse of wiues lacking their husbandes, children their Fathers, and euery freend his freende. And for asmuche as those thinges are come vpon them for thy Names sake, let it be thy good pleasure to helpe them, considering that they are forsaken of all their freendes rounde about: and therefore pray thee that thou wouldest not looke vppon our sinnes, nor the sinnes of our forefathers, whereby we deserue not onely this correction, but vtter destruction, as Sodom and Gomorra: but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to looke vpon thy mercies which were before them: whereby thou hast saide, that although wee doe offend, and thou doest correct vs, yet thou wilt not take away thy mercies from vs, but wilt leaue a remnant which thou wilt multiplie, and make as the Starres of the Heauen, and as the sandes of the Sea. Looke also (O Lord) vpon the outrageous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and crueltie, vnfaithfulnesse, and blasphemie of the enimies, wherewithall they blaspheme thee,
<pb facs="tcp:5592:31"/>
and prouoke thee to thy face, and therefore in thine owne cause, and for thine owne sake, take the matter into thine owne handes, and pay in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the bosomes of thine enimies double and treble of that they haue giuen to thee. Notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, those amongst them, that belong to thine ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly election, hasten their calling, that afterwards thy iudgement may hasten vpon the earthe, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants thereof may learne to know thee by thy iudgements, that would not vnderstand and come to thee, by the louing calling of thy Gospel. Wee pray thee (O Lorde) for our brethren that are vp in armes in both those countries: that thou wouldest goe before them, and come behinde them, and on euery side of them: couer their heades in the day of battel, teache their handes to fight, and their fingers to warre: giue them wisedome and valiantnesse, and good successe in all their enterprises: strike a dizinesse &amp; maaze of spirit into the enimies harts, and take away from them all force, and disappoint al their counsels. And vpon our brethren in Flaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, we beseeche thee that thou wouldest comfort them ouer all the troubles that they haue receiued, and breaches that haue beene made in vpon them: and where there are newe forces euery day gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, new sleights inuented to destroy them, it may please thee, to scatter their forces, and bring their sleightes to nothing. Yea, graunt also (O Lorde) that that which they haue deuised against thy chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, may come vpon their owne heades. And for our Brethren in Fraunce wee beseeche thee (O Lord) what streights so euer they be in, thou woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
<pb facs="tcp:5592:32"/>
deliuer them: and although they be forsaken in the iudgement of all the world, and in their own iudgements, notwithstanding thou that haste the issues of death in thine owne handes, deliuer those that are appointed to deathe. And finally we most humbly thanke thee, for that it hath pleased thee to keepe vs this day, and al the dayes and times of our liues: beseeching thee, that thou wouldest receiue vs this night into thy holy keeping, that we may haue quiet rest, not of bodies alone, but of our soules also, resting from all those thinges that are contrarie to thy moste holy will, attending while thou raisest vs vppe in the morning, to do all those thinges that thou haste appointed vs. These things we desire of thee, and al other things (which thou knowest to be more needefull for vs, and thy whole Church, better then we ourselues do know) for Iesus Christes sake: saying the same prayer, that he himselfe hath taught vs. Our Father. &amp;c.</p>
