            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>A BRIEF
TREATISE,
ON
The Truths behalf in discovery of
Falshoods which are dispersed abroad in two
papers of <hi>Richard Baxters</hi> who is greatly
esteemed of as an able Minister at <hi>Kedarminster</hi>
in <hi>Worcester shire,</hi> but his ignorance and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
is here made appear in his two pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
the one intituled, <hi>One sheet for
the Ministry,</hi> the other <hi>A se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
sheet for the Ministry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And he hath pretended the one against Malignants, among
whom he hath numbred them called Quakers, and uttered
forth his envy in several lies and revilings against that
people called Quakers, whose known integrity shall stand
a witness against all such deceivers and revilers as he is
proved to be perpetually.</p>
            <p>1. Here are several of this said <hi>R. Baxters</hi> lies made manifest and void.</p>
            <p>2. Here is something concerning Ministers maintenance, and tithes, which
this Priest <hi>Baxter</hi> goes about to prove that tithes are both of Civil and Divine
Institution.</p>
            <p>3. Concerning the Priests call to their Ministry, and how it differs from the
true call, with several other things of concernment that here both Magistrates and
people may come to see the blindnesse of the deceivers in this Nation.</p>
            <p>This is given forth onely for the truth sake and for their
sakes who love it, by their friend,

            <p>IT was the enmity and hatred of the old serpent in the
false priests and false prophets of old, when the power
of truth did appear, to hate, persecute and falsely to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
the Righteous seed of God, whom he had wrought
deliverance for out of captivity and bondage, by his
mighty power, and whom he had stirred up thereby to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
for himself, against deceit and deceivers both among
<hi>Jewes</hi> or Gentiles, so that the enmity of the righteous seeds
adversaries was so great, and their rage so stirred against the
true witnesses, that such as witnessed forth the truth, and such
as loved the truth was not onely persecuted and hated by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers,
but also numbred among the seed of evil doers, and
reviled by the wicked, that so one strengthened the hands of
another in wickedness, who said report and we will report,
and because of Lying, and swearing and drunkeness, the land
mourneth and the false Prophets strengthened the hands of
evil doers, and by their lies and lightness made people light
and vain, and they put no difference between the pretious and
vile, and even, so it is evidently seen by the Priests of <hi>England,</hi>
who make it their daily practice to rail, falsely accuse, slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and back-bite the innocent people of God called <hi>Quakers,</hi>
insomuch that the hands of the rude persecutors are daily
strengthened by them, and in stead of seeking the preservati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Lambs of Christs they cast dirt on them, and these
shepherds that feeds themselves and not the flock by their
lies and dirty stuff which they disperse abroad, sets the dogs
on the Lambs of Christ to worry them, so they are far unfit
to be sheapherds or Ministers of Christ, but devourers, one
of whom this priest <hi>Baxter</hi> is plainly proved, who hath
numbred them called <hi>Quakers</hi> among the malignants, drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,
whoremongers, covetous, and all ungodly persons, and
compared them with the Papists, and sayes, <hi>that these wicked
wretches despise and revile the Ministers</hi> (in his one sheet for
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:43100:3"/>
the Ministry, (<hi>page.</hi> 5.) therefore, now I proceed to lay open
his words and lies given forth out of envy against the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
that this Priest may be manifest to be a deceitful Trads<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
and not worthy to be suffered to sell any more of his
deceitful ware, he hath confessed as much as that which they
(to wit the Priests) are brought up to is a trade, as in page 6.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> But to his lie and false accusation, I answer, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignants
are such as are in envie, and hatred, who are given
over to a reprobate mind, and such as are filled with malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
commit sin with greediness, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 28, 29. and for Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
and such, we are truly witnesses against them and against
both root and branch of them, and if the Priests of <hi>England</hi>
could as well shew an evident example for their cleerness
from popery, as we can for ours who are called <hi>Quakers,</hi> there
should not be that vast difference betwixt us that there is; for
then we should not have the Priests to cry against, for uphol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
many of their own traditions, and superfluities, and ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies,
which in their worship they uphold, which in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and form the Papists uphold, though in the esteeming of
their traditions or in the conceit of them there may be some
difference, but in the substance they do agree as in their
sprinkling infants and using bread and wine, and calling it a
sacrament, and in their owning the idols temples or Papists
masse-houses, and the Priests in covetousness, and receiving
Tithes (that great oppression) but something to that I shall
speak hereafter: And for drunkards in this Nation, the greatest
part whereof are of the Priests, hearers or owners of them who
speaks well of the Priests, and will be the readiest to fight for
the Priests, and to hail the children of the Lord out of their
Assemblies, if any of them be moved to speak to them in their
Idols Temple, so we are far from having fellowship with
them. And for his accusing us for envying the Ministry; the
true Ministry we own and love, and God knowes our hearts
we envie not them at all, neither hate we any mans person,
though falsely here he hath numbred us among the wicked, so
if he can let him clear himself from popery, for there are many
things pertaining to Popery that we could justly charge these
Trads-men, the covetouss Priests of <hi>England,</hi> with.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:43100:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>This said Priest,</hi> Baxter, <hi>saith in page the fixth.</hi> These ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
reproach as faithful a Ministry, as the world enjoyeth, the
most of the protestant Churches have a Learned ministry, that is so
taken up with controversies, that they are much less in the powerful
preaching and practise of Godliness.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Indeed that Ministry which the World enjoyeth, are
but little in powerful preaching, for the Ministry which the
world enjoyed was false Prophets and Anti-christs, and they
are of the world, and the world heareth them, (1 <hi>John.</hi> 4, 5.)
and though the truth may be preached to the world by such as
are in the truth, yet the world is not in the enjoyment of it,
for the world loveth its own (Antichrists and false Prophets)
who are less in Godliness indeed, for they are nothing like
God, for they that were deceivers were ungodly men, <hi>Jude</hi> 4.
2 <hi>Peter</hi> 2. 14. so that if this priest and the rest did but consider
what a ministry the world enjoyeth among them, they have
little cause to boast of themselves, or their Ministry.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Priest,</hi> It is for your sakes and souls that they study, and pray,
and fast, and watch, and exhort and labour to the consuming of their
strength; (<hi>and this he speaks to them he calls malignants) on
his own and the priests behalf in</hi> page 6. <hi>and in</hi> page <hi>the 8th.
he saith of the same people he speaks against,</hi> nay such are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for the highest sort of the wicked upon the earth, worse then
drunkards, whoremongers and such filthy beasts, the persecutors of
Gods Ministers, have been ever taken as walking Devils.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> This is such a Ministery as the world enjoyeth indeed,
and altogether out of the faith (so unfaithful) where the
teachers prayes and fasts, for such as this priest confesseth to
be the highest sort of the wicked, and as walking devils, sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
they spend their strength in vain, that prays for such as
they count as Devils, and the worst or highest sort of the
wicked; and how can his or their praying be said to be in the
faith, for such as he doth thus judge, and yet he confesseth that
there is a little help and hope left for their miserable souls;
see his blindness and confusion, have malignants help and
hope? for if they have hope, then have walking devils hope
according to this mans account, and then have the reprobates
hope, but it is manifest that there are some that are given o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:43100:4"/>
to a reprobate mind, and some are without hope, and some
have neglected their visitation, and such are malignants, for
whom we do not spend our strength, neither do we pray for
walking devils, but<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for them whom God hath chosen and will
chuse out of the world, neither did the Apostles pray for filthy
beasts, but for men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Priest.</hi> I profess were it not for the belief of the greatness and
necessity and excellency of the truths that I am to preach, and for the
will of God, and the good of souls, I would be a plow-man, or the
meanest trade if not a sweep-chimny rather then a Minister.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> As for the sake of the belief or greatness of truth: he
himself is proved both to labour out of the true belief &amp; to be
out of the truth, whose labor hath so little effect as it hath, seeing
he labours for such as he compareth to walking devils, and
complains of the drunkards, whoremongers, covetous
and ungodly persons in their parishes, and yet he is a Minister
among such; truly he might see that he Labours but for very
vanity if he were not blind, so that a plowman or a sweep-chimny
are more lawful then this mans trade who makes a
trade upon the scriptures; and its better to be plowman or
sweep chimnies then an unprofitable Teacher.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Priest,</hi> And he that is the accuser of the brethren which accus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
them before God day and night, and is not this the works of the
Quakers?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> No, for the saints were not in the false accusers
work when they cryed against such teachers as were in the
covetous practises, and called them cursed Children, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
are we accusers of the brethren when we witness against
such Ministers now as are in the covetous practises, but do
suffer by the false accuser, many of whose false accusations are
extant in Priest <hi>Baxters</hi> lying papers against us called <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Priest in page ten,</hi> And what else do Quakers and all these sects
that are the enemies of the Minictry, do they not go up and down the
land, and say to the wisest holiest teachers, as if they took them by
the sleeve, come down and let me preach, that can do it better, come
down thou deceiver and ignorant man, and let me come up that am
wiser and better.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:43100:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> I question not but that there are many in this nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that can witness against this Priest for a false accuser in
these words, for we do not use these words, he layes to our
charge, as to say we are wiser and better, and let me come up,
here he accuseth us as if we had as mind to come up
into their pulpits, but such high places or chiefest seats, we
desire not at all, but rather leave them for the hireling priests
that they may appear like Pharisees who had the chiefest pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in the assemblies, whom Christ cryed wo against, and it is
against the Priests, the deceivers that are in the Pharisees steps
that we cry and not against the true Ministers; but we know
that the seed is come that tramples upon the high places of the
earth, and upon these places wherein Idolatry is upheld.</p>
            <p>In the 11 page, Priest <hi>Baxter</hi> takes the labor of most trades<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
in the Town, to be a pleasure to the body in comparison
of his (and saith) <hi>they work in ease, and I in continual pain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Here let such as labour daily with their hands, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
whether this man hath spoken the truth or no, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
compacting a sermon together in a week in his study or
elsewhere, and much of it made ready to his or their hands,
and declaring it over one day, it may be sometimes in two
dayes in the week, and it may be speak by an hour-glass as
many of the Priests in <hi>England</hi> do, whether this be not easier to
the body, then daily hand labours from mornings till even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings?
and he that saith he is in continual pain, it appears
then, that his trade is a bondage to him; but if he were a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
of the Gospel, he would not be in continual pain in
Ministring that, neither would he murmure or complain
as he doth, and as the filthy dreamers did, <hi>Jude</hi> 16. for
the commands of Christ was joyous to his, and the way
thereof they ran with great delight and had joy and peace
and consolation in the Lord which they received through o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
to his commands, and were not in continual pain,
as this priest confesseth he is, and indeed such as he is are like
to be in pain they being in their steps who ran, and the Lord
never sent them, and the Lord is against them, how can they but
be in pain, for the wicked men have no peace with God, and
surely this labour and travail and trade of theirs is deep in
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:43100:5"/>
the curse if they be in continual pain.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Priest.</hi> As wisely do the Quakers argue, that because we use spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacles
or hour-glasses and pulpets, we have not the spirit; it is not
want of your abilities that makes ministers use notes, I use notes as
much as any man, when I take pains, and as little as any man when
I am Lazy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Here hee goes about to plead for the Priests using
hour glasses, pulpets and notes for teaching by, but he cannot
prove that the Ministers of Christ used these things as the
blinde guides in <hi>England</hi> do; and as for pulpets, such was
in <hi>Ezra</hi>'s time, in the time when the Law was read; and the
Pharisees had the chiefest places in the Assemblies, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
<hi>Moses</hi> but denied Christ, and he witnessed against them,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 23. and it is manifest that these that limit a time to
teach in by an hour-glasse, are not led by the spirit of truth;
for the saints did not preach by hour-glasses, for they spake
when, and so long as they were moved by the spirit, neither
did they use notes for Sermons as the priests do, but spake in
the power and demonstration of the spirit: And here he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth
himself to be sometimes Lazy, and before said be had
scarse time to eat and drink. <hi>R. Baxter,</hi> see thy confusion,
What, art thou in continual pain and yet lazy? and yet hast
thou scarse time to eat and drink, thou may have time for
both if thou preach by an hour-glasse; for shame give over
thy trade if it be so tedious to thee, and yet thou art Lazy:</p>

               <head>Now concerning Tithes and Ministers maintenance,
and some other things of concernment.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>And where this said Priest would clear himself of covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and oppression, he begins to plead for their taking tithes,
and his taking hire in these words,</hi> The same Law of the Land
that makes nine parts theirs, doth make the tenth ours; if we have
no title to the tenth, they have none to the rest; we ask none of our
people for a farthing, they give it not to us, it was never theirs
when they buy or take Leases of their Land, it is only the nine parts,
they pay for.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Here he hath neither cleared himself from cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnesse,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:43100:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
oppression, nor from lying, and here he challenges
as great an interest in the Tithes as a man hath in his heritage,
or possession which he hath by inheritance, and they that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
themselves Ministers of Christ, pleads now for Tithes by
a Law of the Nation, when their Gospel will not manage them
in taking Tithes; truly the Masse Priests or Papists might
have brought as strong a proof for their receiving Tithes as
this man brings, and the manner of both their receiving of
them is contrary to the Law of God, and what a man hath
a just right to by inheritance is according to the Law of God,
but so is not the Tithes due to priests, now seeing that the
second priesthood is come which abolished tithes among the
rest of the figures. And for people paying but for 9 parts of
their estates, or farmed lands: Let people see this Priests de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
in this, and bring their evidences or deeds of lands or
leases against him, for do they not mention that every part
and parsel of a tenement or a living thats sold, is for the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
use of him or them that buyes it, or for his or their
heirs, executors or assignes, or every part and parcel of such
a Tenement for the use of him that buyeth it, or for the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers
use; These and such like expressions are recorded in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
legal evidences of the nation for farmes or livings with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any exception for paying the priest tithes, besides there is
the husbandmans labour, or his charges to labourers spended
upon his living or Tenement and goods; so that being consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
in the tithes what the priest takes for tithes, doth amount
in many places to far more then the tenth of their estates, &amp; if
mens ground wanted labour it would lie waste, that the priests
would soon want tithes, which were established by the Pope,
and upheld by Tyrants who could argue as strongly for them
as this priest doth, and therefore by this mans argument were
the mass-priests to be upheld by them because they could plead
for an interest in tithes and other things, by a Law. For shame
you teachers in <hi>England,</hi> if you be not popishly affected, come
out of their steps, places and oppressions, and if you ask not
people for a farthing, then why are so many of the people of
God subpoened up to the Upper Bench, and many have been
imprisoned through your ungospel-like means, and your
envy and covetousness whereby the innocent suffers, and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:43100:6"/>
the creation groans, but the Lord will meet with you,
and pay you your wages for all your deceits one day. And
whereas this lying priest also would here accuse us to make
people Thieves, and to have them rob God, and to prove his
deceit he brings these scriptures, <hi>Mal. 3. 8. Rom. 2. 22. Gen.</hi>
14. 20. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 6, 9.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Its no marvel that this hireling hath here prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
an outward or national Law before the scriptures, for the
scriptures in this place will not at all manage his designe for
tithes, for as for that in <hi>Gen.</hi> 14, 20. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 6. 9. touching
<hi>Melchizedecks</hi> receiving the tenths of the spoil of <hi>Abraham</hi>
when <hi>Abraham</hi> was returned from the slaughter of the Kings,
which was before the Law was given, it maketh nothing for
the priests now receiving the tenths of mens estates, labors and
increases, <hi>and Christ being a Priest for ever after the order of Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisedec,</hi>
was not in order to <hi>Melchisedec</hi>'s receiving the tenths
of <hi>Abraham,</hi> but in order to his Immortality, and his being
without desent, without beginning of dayes or end of time.
And Christ did not give any command for his to take tithes,
and for that in <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 8. in <hi>Malachies</hi> time the Covenant
was with <hi>Levi,</hi> and that was before Christ came in the flesh,
when they were to bring the Tithes unto the store-house, that
the Lord might have meat in his house for fatherless widowes
and strangers, which was according to his covenant and law
to <hi>Levi,</hi> so that then in the prophets time, when they did not
bring the Tithes to the store-house they robbed God, and
the priests had corrupted the covenant of <hi>Levi,</hi> and violated
the Law of God, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2 2. 8. and 3. 8. so now seeing this
priest counts the tithes or hire that they take to be of the Lords
portion in page 14 and that if they have never so much that
they devote it wholly to the Lord as he saith, then I say
where is their store-house,<note place="margin">And if the reader would be further sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ground and rise of Tithes, he may seriusly view a book called the great case of Tithes truly stated by <hi>A. P.</hi>
                  </note> or when do any of them
bring the tithes to a store-house for the relief of
fatherless widdowes and strangers, seeing they
bring that in, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 8. for their taking tithes; it
may as well be said that they rob God: Now if the
first covenant and Levitical Law, and priest-hood
were to be preached up now as they were counted
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:43100:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
robbers of God in <hi>Mallachies</hi> time that brought not the tithes to
the store-house. But we conclude that that priesthood that took
tithes is changed, and of necessity, the Law is changed and the
commandment disanulled that gave tithes. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. and where
this priest here would plead for tithes to be of divine instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
by that in <hi>Mat</hi> 23. 23. here he would grosely blind the minds
of people indeed, and here he hath plainly brought a popish
argument in effect, and cited the Scriptures that the papists
plead for tithes by, as I have seen in an annotation of their,
adjoyned to that in <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. but let me tell both the papists and
the priests of <hi>England,</hi> that when Christ spoke that in, <hi>Mat.</hi>
23. 23. that this was before he suffered on the cross, whereto
he nailed the hand writing of Ordinances, and blotted it out,
<hi>Colos.</hi> 2. and he abolished in the flesh, the Law of command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
contained in ordinances; so that this priest and the rest
that pleads for tithes to continue in that particular, do deny
Christ come in the flesh, and are enemies to his cross, mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
earthly things, and for earthly ends pleads for Tithes,
as to maintain themselves in ease, and them and their
wives and children in pride and Idleness, which causeth
the creation to groan, and causeth many poor men to work
hard and earn their livings dearly; so that which they receive
from the people is not devoted to the Lord as the Lords por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but coveted unto themselves, for the maintaining of
these covetous, lazy shepherds in <hi>England;</hi> and to maintain his
deceit, he also saith <hi>that the primative Christians gave not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the tenth, but all that they had, and laid it at the Apostles
feet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I answer, but here the Apostles did not receive tithes for
themselves, nor plead for tithes as a Divine institution, as the
Priests do; for this was that distribution might be made unto
every man according as he had need, <hi>Act.</hi> 4. 35. And this said
Priest also goes about further to cover this his evil coveteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
and oppression by that in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 5. 7. 13, 14. To which
I answer, that he, and the rest of his companions, in iniquity
are manifest to be in anti-christs deceit, and in cursed practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
and the root of all evil sprung up in them, to wit covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
after mony, and the fruit of it, as oppression which abounds
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:43100:7"/>
among them, and covetousness is idolatry, so the priests that
are covetous are Idolaters, so then these Idolaters Anti-christs,
blinde guids and Deceivers have no interest in that lively<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
that pertained to the Gospel for their teaching, seeing
that they are no Ministers of the Gospel; so for living of the
Gospel they cannot, and for going a warfare for the gospel
they do not forgoing a warfare is not a lying loytering at ease
in settled places as the Priests in <hi>England</hi> do, like lazy drones
who never came to endure hardship, as the souldiers of Christ
have done and do, who go not a warfare at their own char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
but their Master Christ bears them out and rewards them,
and puts them forth, and goes before them, and they live of the
Gospel, as his true Ministers have done who had power from
him to eat and drink, where they were received according to
his command, <hi>Mat. 10. 1 Cor.</hi> 9. but not to take tithes, nor
to oppress people as the Priests do; so now <hi>R. Baxter</hi>
thy false cloak for covetousness is quite rent, and all thy ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing
for preaching for hire, and taking tithes, will not at
all maintain thee therein, neither doth any scripture prove
these thy practises, nor are they at all concordable with the
Saints practises.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Priest.</hi> Prove us unsanctified, and we will refign our office.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Thou art proved a covetous man, an idolater, a
false accuser, a deceiver; and covetous unthankful men,
(such as thou art) ware unholy, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 2, 3, 4:
then you are unsanctified, for such as are unholy may Justly
be said to be unsanctified, therefore if thou and you do not
resign your office, you'l be further taken notice of, who hold
up a deceitful trade that God wil overthrow who make a trade
upon the Scripture, and are teachers for hire which <hi>Micha</hi> and
the Prophets of God cryed against, &amp; <hi>R. Baxter</hi> thou hast con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
as much as that which you are brought up to at the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities
as thou callest them is a trade, in these words (<hi>to wit,
would not the time &amp; labour and cost that they are at in the Schooles
and Vniversities, have fitted them for a more gainful trade?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> It appears then that they that have mony enough
therby may bind themselves as Apprentiless at <hi>Oxford</hi> or <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridg</hi>
(or at <hi>Durham,</hi> which of late is set up to bring up such
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:43100:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
tradesmen) as through carnal industry and bestowing cost
may come to such a trade as <hi>R. Baxter,</hi> and the rest of
the priests are of, truly they may even be ashamed of calling
themselves Ministers of Christ, seeing that they are set up and
made Ministers by the will of man, through carnal cost, and
their own labour, but here they are out of the true wisdom,
for it cannot be purchased with gold, <hi>Job.</hi> 28. 15. And thus
for the Priests education to their Ministry, they cannot prove
it to be as the call that <hi>Timothy</hi> and the elders in the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of Christ had, though this priest hath gone about de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfully
in his second sheet to prove it; but y<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>u may see fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
concerning that shortly and in plainness.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Priest.</hi> In his fifth and thirteenth pages he confesseth that
there is scandals in the Ministry (as drunkenness and swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>&amp;c.) and saith, that Ministers are still spurring on the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates,
to cast out the insufficient, negligent, and scandalous.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> If the Priest be still spurring on the Magistrates, then
they make slaves on them, and makes them as beasts, or horses
that wants understanding, truly if the Magistrates grow not
weary of their teachers they are very blinde, and very much
feared in their consciences, for who could stil endure spurring
on, but I believe that if the Priests spur the Magistrates on as he
calls it, its more for their own preferments that the priests
have petitioned often to the Magistrates for Tithes, Aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations
and preferments in the earth to satisfie
their ungodly covetousnesse, rather then spurred them on to
cast out drunkards and swearers; but if the Magistrates
stood in the counsel of God, they would have understanding
how to act for God, and do their duty in obedience to God
of a ready mind, and would not need the priests continually
to spur them on as slaves; But be not ye like the horse or mule
that wanteth understanding, but learn judgement and do ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
<hi>ye Rulers.</hi> And what, have the Priests been Rulers so
long, (as this priest pleads for them to be) and teachers in
<hi>England</hi> so many years, and have they not cast out from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them the drunkards and swearers yet? Its even time for
them to resign their office indeed: And this Priest saith, <hi>that
Magistracy is as truly from God as the Ministry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then I say what need any Ministers be still spurring on the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:43100:8"/>
Magistrates as this Priest saith, that they do (also he saith, that
there is a clearer word in the gospel for the Ministry then for
the Migistracy in page 2.) Then I say, How is Magistracy as
truly from God as the Ministry? If there be a clearer word for
the one then the other, and also to say that there is two words
in the Gospel, the one not so clear as the other, is another er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour;
for every Word of God is clear; and for Magistracy,
and the power that Magistrates are intrusted withall it is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
of God, but the Magistrates or Rulers that do uphold
such blinde guides as this, who is in such errours and confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
they grossely abuse their power, and shall give an account
for it one day. And this said Priest saith to them he calls Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignants,
&amp;c. <hi>If you will come and help us to cast out any that
are vitious and unworthy, wee will give you thanks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Here he speaks of such helping them as before he
counted as walking devils, and as the highest in wickednesse
upon earth; surely he can but help his hearers badly and mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
for their souls seeing his strength is so much decayed,
that he would thank them he cals malignants if he could have
their help, it may be justly said that they that seek to him
for help do but go down into <hi>AEgypt</hi> for help.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Priest.</hi> If the Magistrates stop the mouths of such raylors and
abusers of God and men, he doth no more persecute then he persecut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
a thief when he haugeth him (<hi>and this he speaks against them
called</hi> Quakers <hi>in page</hi> 12.)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Here his envy and maliciousnesse is made appear
whereby he would stir up the Magistrates to persecute us for
our profession, which we know Christ Jesus is the Authour of,
and this is because that we are made to witnesse against him,
and against such deceitful tradesmen as he is, but if he were
in the truth, and saw us in errors, then he would not seek to
incense the Magistrates to persecute us, but rather seek to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
us by sound doctrine, and a good example, but such as
he are manifest to be out of both, and he would bring <hi>Paul</hi>
and <hi>Peter</hi> and the Churches of Christ for a cloak to his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,
which here he hath uttered to the Magistrate against us,
but they will not cover him nor his deceit; for though they
rejected, judged and delivered some up to Satan, yet they did
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:43100:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
not persecute them nor complain to the Magistrates to have the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
east into prison, nor to have their goods taken from them for
their profession, as many of the priests in <hi>England</hi> have done,
by whom many of the servants of the Lord in <hi>England</hi> have
suffered and do suffer, both the spoiling of their goods, and
imprisonments, and some the losse of their lives in prisons,
whose sufferings will rise up as a heavy judgement when their
prayers shall be fulfilled against their persecutors.</p>
               <p>And this said Priest it appears allows <hi>of hanging them that
steal,</hi> seeing that he would have us persecuted, and counts it
as lawful as <hi>hanging a thief.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> Here this is a murtherous spirit, that would take
away the life for the creatures, and so doing is contrary to the
Law of God, Let the Priest and the Magistrate read <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.
1, 2, 3. <hi>If a man shall steal an Ox or a Sheep and kill it
or sell it, he shall restore five oxen for an Ox, and 4. Sheep
for a sheep.</hi> If a thief be found breaking up, and be smitten
that he die, there shall no blood be shed for him; if the sun be
risen upon him, there shall he blood shed for him, for
he should make restitution. If he have nothing, then he shall
be sold for his theft, <hi>Mark</hi> by this then if the thief was slain
after the sun was risen, there was blood to be shed for him, and
in verse the fourth, if the theft certainly be found alive in
his hands, whether it be Ox, Ass, or Sheep, he shall restore
double, and in <hi>Eph. 4. 28. Let him that stole steal no more, but
rather let him labour, working with his hands the thing which is
good, that he may have to give to him that needeth;</hi> but he doth
not say that he is to be hanged for this theft, and how shall he
labour or work with his hands if he be hanged? Therefore
Magistrates had need to take heed of hanging thieves, and
priests of allowing it.</p>

               <p>Whereas <hi>R: Baxter</hi> in his first proposition in pages 3, 4:

sort (as he calls them) was not to declarewhat they had imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately

what they have heard of others, and saith that the holy
Ghost is to help us in keeping that which is committed to us,
and not to reveal more.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> This is a false distinction and a perverting the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
to distinguish Elders, Pastors and Teachers, or Bishops
from them that had Revelation and immediate teaching, and
from being Apostles, for <hi>John</hi> was an Elder and declared what
he had revealed, that which he had heard, that which he had
seen, and which he had looked upon, which was from the
beginning, the same he shewed to others, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1. 1. And
he saith the Elder unto the Elect Lady, and the Elder unto

before they were allowed of for their Office by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
who were first to be tryed, and then they were to Minister;
now that which presented them blameless was the gift of God,
and they had the gift revealed in them, and a <hi>Bishop, and a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con
must be blameless, not given to wine, no striker, not greedy of
filthy Lucre, but patient, not a brawler, not covetous, and apt to
teach,</hi> and so must Elders, for they were Bishops, <hi>Titus.</hi> 1. 5, 6. 7.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Priest.</hi> Now seeing this said priest professeth the Ministry in
<hi>England</hi> to be of this sort, for he saith in page the tenth <hi>for qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications,
they have first competent knowledge, secondly and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terance,
thirdly and godliness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> That's all false, For first how can they have compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
knowledge seeing that they deny revelation, and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
teaching, when as Christ saith no man knowes the father
but the Son, and he to whom the Son will reveal him, <hi>Mat.</hi>
11. here they that denies revelation knowes neither the father
nor the Son. Let Christs own words stand a witness against
this lying Priest, and the rest of them: Secondly true utterance
they are far from, seeing that they deny immediate teaching by
the spirit; for true utterance was a gift of the Spirit, the Saints
spoke as the spirit gave them utterance, and the spirit &amp; word of
God was revealed in <hi>Timothy</hi> &amp; <hi>Titus,</hi> who were owned for Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
by the Apostles, &amp; <hi>Timothy</hi> had the gift of God in him, and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:43100:10"/>
unfeigned faith in him, and that gift was given by Prophesie
with the laying on of the hands of the company of Elders, as
it is in some translations recorded, now his call was not like
the call of these Priests of <hi>England,</hi> for the Prophefies that went
on <hi>Timothy,</hi> they came not by the will of man, neither was the
laying on of Elders hands according to mans will. So that
though the Priests would put themselves in number with <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi>
and the Elders, yet we find them shut out from their call
and Ministry, for we never understood that they that set up
these priests were called as <hi>Peter</hi> or <hi>Paul,</hi> or the Elders, who
had power to lay on the hands, that the holy Ghost fell on the
party on whom they laid on their hands, and thus much will
some of the Priests confess, which may be to the shame of him
that here professeth himself to be called as <hi>Timothy</hi> was. And
further this man aforesaid hath confessed that the Ministers for
whom he pleads, are brought up at the Universities, as he calls
them, where they have bestowed labour and cost to bring them
up to the Ministery, which might have fitted them for a more
gainful trade; so that here their education is not to the true
Ministry, but to a trade; but <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> and the elders
in the true Churches, on whom the Apostle laid hands, did not
make a trade on their Ministry, nor on the Scripture, though
they knew the Scriptures and did preach the word of God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Scriptures by the gift of God in them, and who
was to do the work of Evangelists, whom Christ had endued
with gifts from above, neither was the holy Ghost to be bought
with mony though it fell on several who believed, when the
Apostles laid their hands on them, for he and his mony was to
perish who would have bought the holy Ghost with mony,
<hi>Acts</hi> 8. 19. 20. So all the cost that the priests bestowes at <hi>Oxford</hi>
or <hi>Cambridge,</hi> it doth but purchase them a trade, and that a
deceitful one too, it cannot purchase the holy Ghost, nor the
gifts of the spirit, which Bishops, Elders, and Deacons, in the
true Churches were indued and fitted with, but not made Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
at Schools, nor by the will of man, as the priests are now.
Thirdly, Neither are they in godlinesse nor qualified as a true
Bishop, or a Deacon, or Elder, seeing that the Priests in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi>
are covetous, greedy of filthy lucre, and many of them
given to wine, and envious men, and brawlers, and novices as
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:43100:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
many in this nation can witness, but the true Elders were not
such, and the man of God was to flee from the desire of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
and they that went in the error of <hi>Balaam</hi> for reward, and
in the way of <hi>Cain</hi> to envy, and through covetousnesse made
merchandise of people, were ungodly men, ordained of old
for condemnation, <hi>Jude 11. 2 Pet.</hi> 2. Therefore the Priests
being ignorant of Revelation, immediate teaching from God,
and being out of the true knowledge, utterance and godliness,
so strangers to the heavenly gift, they are not fit to teach, but
are deceivers, shut out from among the number of the true El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of Christ, for the ungodly shall not be numbered with the
seed of the righteous; but we look at the life and gifts of God
which qualifies and brings into the state and condition that
the true Elders, Bishops and Deacons were in, more then
their names, seeing that they could not have these names, nor
be ordained for their office by the Apostles, till they were first
fitted and tryed in the truth, and by the gift of God which was
in the Apostles and elders of the true Church, who denyed not
revelation and immediate teaching, for they had that revealed
in them which they taught, and by that knew the holy scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
which are able to make a man wise unto salvation
through faith that is in Christ, but without faith which is
revealed, and the gift of God, the Scriptures cannot be known
as they ought to be, for it is the man of God that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
are profitable for the furnishing of, and for our learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
they are written who walk not after the flesh but after the
Spirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Priest.</hi> But we are not built on the foundation of every Pastor,
Teacher, Elder, Bishop, or Deacon, though both in their places,
Apostles, Prophets, Evangelists, Pastors, and Teachers are given
for the perfecting of the Saints, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Here he would make two foundations, the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Prophets and Apostles, not to be the foundation of
the Pastors, Teachers, and Elders, (which were all given of
God) here he hath quite shut himself forth of the number of the
true Church, and hath shut himself out from being one of that
sort of Ministers which before he pretended himself to be of,
so that this doth the more confirm to what I have written, for
how can he be either true Pastor, Teacher, or Elder, when he
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:43100:11"/>
is not built upon their foundation, according to his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
so he cannot be any Minister of Christ who is not built
upon the true foundation which is but one; so you may take
notice of <hi>R. Baxters</hi> confusion, for another foundation can no
man lay then that which is laid, which is Christ, and they that
were members of the true Church, were built upon the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Prophets and Apostles, Christ Jesus being the chief
corner stone, who was &amp; is the saints foundation, and that buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
which is not builded upon Christ, shall as surely fall as
<hi>R. Baxter</hi> is proved to be no Minister of Christ, and that is sure
enough.</p>
               <p>Priest. <hi>In page the 14 he brins an objection which is,</hi> But
you are not ordained by Bishops; <hi>his answer is</hi> almost all in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland
are till of late, if that will serve, our parish Presbyters are
Bishops, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Here he goes about to justifie the Bishops that was in
<hi>England,</hi> ordaining of priests, so that in this he is setting up
that which before he pretended they had taken down as in his
other sheet in page the sixth, he saith, <hi>have not the Ministers
themselves been the pincipal instruments of taking down Bishops,
Deans, and chapters, Arch-Deacons, Prebends, and all means
of preferments, and what have they got by it?</hi> so he that is here
setting up that which before he hath pretended, that the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
have taken down, here he makes himself a transgressor;
and people may take notice further against this priest for a lyar
that all means of preferment which the Bishops was preferred
in, the Priests of <hi>England</hi> have not taken down, seeing that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
all of them, till of late are ordained by the Bishops; so
they are not Christs Ministers, but Bishops Ministers, and if
all the Bishops means of preferment were taken down by the
Priests, then what means the Priests taking Tithes and uphold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
such great oppression, as causeth the creation to groan, and
their suing people at Law, and their causing of them to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoned
that refuse to pay the Priests Tithes (for conscience
sake) surely here is Bishops Ministers, upholding Bishops
Tyranny, and that by Bishops Lawes that are corrupt (and
unrepealed) as may be made appear: This Priest hath quite
cast himself into the mire, and hath made his call void, for he
saith in his 16 page (<hi>the truth of our doctrine depends not on our
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:43100:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
calling</hi>) Then it is manifest that their calling is a false calling,
for if it were of God it were according to true doctrine, &amp; true
doctrine that's preached in obedience to a true calling; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
on, or hath unity with that calling.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Priest.</hi> He that hath no just call shall answer for what he doth as
an intruder, but the people shall have for all that the fruit of his
Ministration, and preaching, and Baptism, and other acts shall
not be null to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Thats false, for they that ran and the Lord sent them
not (they had not a just call from God) they could not profit the
people at all, therefore their teaching was null to the people as
yours is, who are not built upon the foundation of the true
Prophets, and Elders, accordingly as it is made appear in the
foregoing words, as also is your unjust call; and here thou goest
about to vindicate an intruders preaching, when as the Apostle
witnessed against such, <hi>Colos.</hi> 2. for intruders are mainly puft
up in their fleshly minds, and even so is he that would have
them to be preachers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Priest.</hi> In page the ninth, <hi>The necessities of the Church continue,
we still need a Teaching Ministry,</hi> and for that he brings, <hi>Heb.</hi>
5. 11.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> In <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. there is no such word as that the necessities of
the Church continue, here he is proved to be a perverter of the
Scripture, as it may be seen in that place, for those unto whom
the Apostle spoke was dull of hearing, so he reproved them,
for when as for the time they might have been teachers, they
themselves had need to have been taught, but he did not say
they still needed teaching by Ministers, as this priest would
have the Church to continue in necessity, and so then if the
necessity of the Church continue, the Church is not supplied; Oh
what blindness is here, that ever people should be blinded and
led by such blind guids as this, they may be in want and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity,
still ever learning, never able to come to the knowledge
of the truth indeed, that are lead by them, and never come to
receive the promise, while they are led by such, but the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
of God was fulfilled in the Churches who were taught of
God as he had promised, <hi>they shall not need to teach every man
his neighbour, saying know the Lord, but they shall all know
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:43100:12"/>
me from the least to the greatest saith the Lord, Heb.</hi> 8
and <hi>John</hi> wrote to them that needed not that any man
should teach them, for <hi>they had the annoiting from the father
which taught them of all things,</hi> but this said Priest hath
been much pleading for himself, and such as he is to be the
principal members, parts and supporters of the Church, but it
may be truly said that such Churches as have such as he is for
their principal members and supporters, that they are both blind
and lame; &amp; dumb from speaking any thing from revelation or
immediate teaching from God, but them of the true Church
witnessed both, for they might all prophesie one by one,
1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 14. 31. And this priest also saith in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
page that there is no salvation promised but to the
Church, and brings <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5. 23, 25, 26, 27, and <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 16. to
prove his deceit when there is no such word in these scriptures
as he brings them for, but if he had said that there are none in
whom the promise of salvation is fulfilled, but them of the true
Church, he would not need have been questioned for so saying,
but Christ who is the covenant and the salvation of God, he is
promised <hi>to be his salvation to the ends of the earth, and he is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
for a light unto the Gentiles,</hi> and the scripture foreseeing (or
foretelling) <hi>that God would justifie the heathen through faith, Gal.</hi>
3. 8. and they shall be called the people of God that were not
his people, so that the promise of God reached unto a people,
before it was fulfilled, and before that they were united into
the Church, but this blinde guide hath made manifest his igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
concerning the promise of salvation as he hath done con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
many other things he hath given forth in his lying pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
who saith that <hi>many thousands are damned for want of the
light,</hi> but in this he is also in errour, for thousands are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
by the light, because they hate it, <hi>and this is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation,
that light is come into the world, and men loved dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
rather then the light because their deeds are evil, John</hi> 3. And
this said priest in his second page would accuse them he calls
<hi>Quakers</hi> for being the Papists Agents but this we deny and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
it back again upon him, for both the Papists, their wayes,
worships, superstition and deceits and adherents we clearly wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
against in life, conversation and doctrine, as in many things
is evident to the World in many of our books and manner of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:43100:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
our life; and for them he calls <hi>Seekers</hi> among whom he num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
us, All that are seeking, worshipping or waiting in their
own wills and imaginations we deny, but they that seek in sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity
so as to find the right way we own them according to
the true light wherein the drawings of God is manifest unto
them that believe in the Light <hi>which doth inlighten every man
that cometh into the world.</hi> And <hi>R. Baxter</hi> saith <hi>this is the
saving Gospel that the Seekers, Quakers and their brethren
preach, that the scripture is not the Gospel, &amp;c.</hi> I answer,</p>
               <p>If the <hi>Quakers</hi> preach a saving Gospel, then out of thy own
mouth art thou judged, to revile and speak evil of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
of the Gospel, and then why hast thou written so much
against the <hi>Quakers</hi> as thou calls them, if they preach the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Gospel which is everlasting, which was before the scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
was. But didst thou mean as thou hast spoken? if thou
did, then why do not you Priests preach that which here thou
saist we preach. But what thou <hi>R. Baxter</hi> hath uttered in these
two sheets is not the first time thou hast set thy self against
the innocent and against the Truth with thy lies and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusions,
as the Reader may be further satisfied concerning
thee if he read the Answer to thy book called <hi>The Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
Catechism,</hi> and that book tituled (<hi>Many strong reasons
confounded</hi>) in answer to another lying sheet of thine against
the <hi>Quakers;</hi> And here thou art proved a Deceiver, a Ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor,
and false accuser of the innocent, a teacher and disperser
of lies and false doctrines, and thy call to be a false call,
and thou and the rest that own thee to be out of the true
foundation: Therefore stop thy mouth, and give over thy
trade for shame, and be confounded, for the light is risen
and the morning is broken forth which discovers all you
blinde guides, and destroyers of souls, and your filthinesse
shame and confusion is made appear, and your noysom smell
of wickednesse, oppression, pride and deceit is come up
before the Lord who will consume you by the breath of
his mouth and will scatter you and break you, and stamp
you to pieces. Dread and tremble you <hi>Babylons</hi> Tradesmen,
for the time is a coming that your ware shall not be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed
of, and you shall wail for the misery that is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:43100:13"/>
upon you, and let all that love their souls save them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
from this wicked generation of deceivers, and return
to the Lord God, and walk in his light which shineth in
their hearts, to receive the teachings of his wayes, that the
true promises and Ministry they may partake of, and deny
the false ministry and ministers which we are made through
the truth to witnesse against and renounce with their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honesty,
and we preach not to keep people alwayes learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
but that they may bee turned from the darknesse to
the light, and come to see the true Ministry fulfilled in them
by the spirit of Truth. This onely lay upon me to give
forth for the Truths sake, to clear it, and them that are
in it from lies, otherwise I should have been willing to have
suffered under them, for it is no pleasure nor advancing to me
to search in the Priests confusion.</p>
