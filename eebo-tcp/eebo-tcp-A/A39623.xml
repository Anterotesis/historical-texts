            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

God; and these tenents he stands out stoutly for, <hi>viz.</hi>

            <p n="1">1 That Bishops, be they never so wicked, are <hi>Iure Divino.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2 That the government of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as it now stands by Archbishops, Bishops, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is so holy a govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that it is a sin to alter it.</p>
            <p n="3">3 That the discipline which the Prelates establish, be it what it will, is <hi>Iure Divino.</hi>

            <p n="5">5. That Christ is not originally God, some of them have taught.</p>

That the Scriptures are not the onely meanes, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning God, of all that profitably we know, and that therefore we must build our faith on that construction which the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates of the Church make of the Scripture, to prevent private construction thereof: as the Bishop of <hi>Yorkes</hi> Chaplaine, and divers others have affirmed.</p>
            <p n="7">7. That mans will is apt naturally, (without grace) to take or refuse any particular object, whatsoever presented unto it; and so consequently to beleeve, that mens naturall workes, or to do that which Nature telleth us (without grace) must needs be acceptable to God; as some of our Bishops have taught.</p>
            <p n="8">8. That the Word of God can not assure us, that it is the Word of God, and from thence to draw arguments to take all things upon trust from the Church, whatsoever they esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish. How dangerous this doctrine is to overthrow the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals, and principles of a Christians faith, let all men judge?</p>
            <p n="9">9 That a man may doe workes, in themselves absolutely good, and acceptable in the sight of God, as they all main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.</p>

            <p n="12">12 That to be preserved from all sin in this life, is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible.</p>
            <p n="13">13 That the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> (as it now standeth) is the family of Christ, and some members of that Church amongst us, are the Kings best subjects, as Master <hi>Squire</hi> of Shore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditch, and others have preached.</p>
            <p n="14">14 That Idolatrous wicked Hereticks are members of the visible Church, if they be not excommunicated, as it hath bin often taught in Pauls by some of the Arminians.</p>

            <p n="16">16 That wee ought to receive the Communion upon an Altar, and not on a Table.</p>
