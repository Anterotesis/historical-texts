            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And ſo <hi>Arnoldus</hi> concludeth, that nothing to doe good to the ſight, is to bee compared with wine made with eiebrright. If the wine be too ſtrong, hee counſelleth to alay the ſame vvith fenell water, and to that intention, you may alſo adde ſugar.</p>
            <p>In countries vvhich for their common drinkes do vſe wine and water, they alway do mingle things for the ſight in wine, and not in water: for wine in truth is a fitter li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor to receiue the qualities and to carie the ſame to the eies, then water: vvhich thinges they do put in the muſte, and ſo let it ſtand, vntill the wine be ripe, and ready <note place="margin">Eiebrigh may bee vſed in beere, in ale, or meade.</note> to be dronken, and ſo doe vſe it.</p>
            <p>Notvvithſtanding in other countries vvhich haue other vſuall drinkes, the ſame things may be put in their common drinks.

So ſome haue put them in ale, ſome in beere, and ſome in meade, and no doubt but all theſe meanes are very good accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the vſage and diſpoſition of the partie. So even in this our countrie, they which either by vſe or by conſtitution of body, may wel beare the drinking of wine, may well compound the ſame with things good for the ſight: others of hot complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and drie, not greatly accuſtomed to wine, may of ale, beere, and meade make ſuch drinkes, becauſe in the North coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, ale and beere are the vſuall and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon drinkes, and in ſome places, meade al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo is much vſed: therefore in mine opinion it is convenient for moſt men, to make theſe drinkes with ale, beere, and meade, rather then with wine: and meade aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is a very convenient thinge for them which can well away with hony.</p>
            <p>Touching the direction of thoſe which <note place="margin">How eie-bright wine may be vſed</note> haue bin accuſtomed to drinke wine, I do nothing doubt, but that they may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out offence beare ſuch drinks for the ſight, compounded with wine, to take a draught in the morning, eſpecially if they alay the ſame with the diſtilled water of fenell, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:15241:8"/>
to <hi>Arnoldus</hi> counſell. And for this purpoſe, choyſe may bee made of verie good white wine, and the thinges may be mingled in the countries where the wine doth growe, notwithſtanding in that our <note place="margin">The vſe of eiebright ale, and of eiebright beere.</note> moſt vſed drinke with meat is ale, or beere, theſe are very convenient to receiue theſe thinges for the ſight, and abſolutely better then wine, if yee like to drinke the ſame with meate: as our authors doe counſell. Which ale I thinke better to be made with <note place="margin">Ale made with grout.</note> grout according to the olde order of brew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And ſo the thinges for the ſight may be ſodden in the grout, or other way put <note place="margin">How to make eie-bright ale and beere.</note> in the drinke, when it is newly clenſed, &amp; put into the veſſell in vvhich ſit is tunned to be kept, that in the working of the drink in the veſſell, the vertues and qualities of the thinges may bee drawen and receiued into the ſame.

            <p>I thinke it beſt to begin with the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleſt order to compound ale or beere to ech mans beſt liking with eiebright onely,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:15241:9"/>
taking to every gallon of the drink a great handfull of the herbe, and bind it togither, <note place="margin">The quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie of eie-bright to the drinke</note> or put it in raw and thinne tinſell of ſilke, and ſo tie the ſame by a ſtring to the tap of the veſſell, that the herbe may hang in the middeſt of the drinke, not too low in the grownd, neither to high in the barme, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put into the drinke vvhen it is nevvlie clenſed: let all vvorke togither vntill the drinke be cleare and ripe, to bee dronken according to the common vſe, and then ye may drinke of it at pleaſure in the morning faſting, and at meate alſo if you will, and can vvell like thereof; and moſt men may like to drinke it, becauſe this herbe doeth yeelde no vngratefull taſte, but rather with a pleaſant ſapour doth commende the drinke. It were not amiſſe to avoide windines, to every handfull of the herbe, to adde two drammes of fenell ſeeds, well <note place="margin">Fenell ſeedes.</note> duſted, and a little bruiſed. As I do put this for more proportion to beginne vvith-all, that the ſtomacke be not at the firſt offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with the ſtrangenes: So after a time, yee may increaſe the quantitie, and put to every gallon of the drinke, tvvo handfuls of the herbe, vvherein yee may beſt be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected

by the taſte, that the herbe ſhall yeelde into the drinke.

            <p>I can witnes, that many by this ſimple <note place="margin">The effect confirmed by exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</note> compoſition of eiebright and fenell ſeeds, haue found great good for their ſight, not onelie to continue in good eſtate, but alſo that ſome haue found remedie againſt the dimnes &amp; other impediments, growing in their ſight.
