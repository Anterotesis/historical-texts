            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

were about three hundred <hi>Engliſh</hi> perſons that day cruelly murthered, the particular manners after which they were ſlaine we cannot yet fully learne; but to ſome they would not give leave to ſay their prayers before their end, others had their noſes and eares cut off, being cruelly tortured before they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched them; Some women had their hands and armes cut off, yea joynted alive to make them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe where their money was.

            <p>What ſhall we ſay of the raviſhing of women before their owne Husbands faces, yea ſome greene women lying in child-bed, burning Churches (late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly built at the great expences of the Engliſh) downe to the ground, making other Churches ſlaughter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes, and others Maſſe Houſes, pulling downe the Kings Armes and defacing them? time would faile me to reckon up all their outrages in this kind.</p>

and the Enemy perceiving it, was put to a ſtand for a while, ſo that on Saturday little was done in the County of <hi>Cavan,</hi> only the high She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffe of that Countie <hi>Molmory O Rely,</hi> roſe with foureſcore Rebels more, and gave out that hee had the Kings warrant to diſarme all the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and ſo came to <hi>Farnam</hi> Caſtle, thence tooke armes for himſelfe, and all his followers, and ſo poſted to <hi>Clogh-water</hi> Caſtle, a Caſtle ſcituated in an Iland, which is of great ſtrength. There he impriſoned <hi>Arthur Culham</hi> Eſquire, his wife and children, and what uſage they have had ſince, God only knoweth.</p>
            <p>After the ſaid maſter <hi>Aldridge</hi> had done this ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, in forewarening the County, whereby the Lord <hi>Burlaſſe</hi> his troope gathered moſt of them together, and got their horſes and armes, which otherwiſe would have beene all ſurprized in their beds, and their horſes and armes converted to their enemies uſe: He tooke along with him Doctor <hi>Teate</hi> of <hi>Balliheyes,</hi> and ſome other friends, who reſolved that night, to paſſe as farre as they could towards <hi>Dublin,</hi> to ſave themſelves, and to give notice to the ſtate, as ſoone as they could<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and theſe came twelve or thirteene miles from the <hi>Cavan,</hi>

But a little on this ſide <hi>Virginia,</hi> (a Towne ſo called in the foreſaid County) three or foureſcore armed men ſuddenly compaſſed them in, and knocked them off their Horſes, ſtripped the ſaid Maſter <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dridge</hi> and his ſub-Sheriffe ſtarke naked, they knocked the ſaid Doctor thrice to the ground, wounded him dangerouſly in the head, and ſo left them to travell barefoot all that cold night through thoſe rough wayes. The ſaid Doctor ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving nothing on his ſlaſhed head, but a cap of blood, and with much adoe they ſcaped with their lives, upon the Doctors naming ſome of them by their names, who afterwards forbore, and ſo diſmiſt them, ſore repenting after, they had ſo done (as one relates that ſince heard them, and paſſed through their mercileſſe hands.) But ſince then, all that have come from among them, have beene monſtrouſly abuſed. More then two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men women and children came from <hi>Bell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbet,</hi> and thereabouts, in one flocke, but thoſe Wolves (falſe in their word) having promiſed they ſhould part in peace, with their clothes on their backs, and to this end two hundred of them went along with this armeleſſe harmleſſe people,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:95785:7"/>
eight or nine miles, pretending to preſerve them from other Aſſaſinates, but meeting there with a multitude of their aſſociates, men, women, and boyes, joyning altogether, they ſtript them all ſtarke naked, except ſome few lovely women, whom they tooke backe (as is ſuppoſed) to <hi>Bell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbet.</hi> An hundred of thoſe poore naked ſoules, in froſt and ſnow periſhed for want of food, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they came to <hi>Dublin.</hi> Some ſixteene women fell in Labour by the way, and ſo miſcarried. Some with ſudden terrour fell diſtracted (the Lord be their comfort) yea they have throwne ſome ſucking Infants on the ſnowie ground, and ſtripped them ſtarke naked to ſearch for money, which they thought was hidden in their ſwadling clothes, and that for twenty miles and more toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; And if any clothes were given to theſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked ones by the way, they were ſure to be rifled afreſh, within one five miles, either by the men which were bad, or by the women which were worſe, or by their children, which would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them with greateſt inſultation and ſcorne, none daring to reſiſt their inſolencies. Yet to ſome of his ſervants the Lord hath extended marvellous great grovidence and mercy, and as <hi>Acts</hi> 27. 44.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:95785:8"/>
ſome came to land on plankes, ſome on broken peeces of the Ship, ſo ſome have paſſed theſe pikes, ſome with torne clothes and rags, ſome with roules of Hay about their middles, ſome with ſheep-skins and goat-skins, and ſome of the riflers themſelves exchanged their tattered ragges for the Travellers better cloathes. But above all, Gods extraordinary providence towards Doctor <hi>Teate</hi> is not to be forgotten, who being ſpent with tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell, and effuſion of bloud, prayed the Lord to put an end to his miſeries, either by life or death, it pleaſed God that preſently after day breake he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtrayed from the reſt, in the darke, came to an houſe where accidentally an <hi>Iriſh</hi> Chirurgion was, who formerly never had reſorted thither, and hee waſhed his head, and applied a ſoveraigne Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to his wound, and bound it up with a little Linnen clout, wherein he found great comfort, and ſo got a horſe to <hi>Kells,</hi> where he met his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and was refreſhed. The like or greater pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence did the ſame bounteous hand extend to his ſucking babe, who after he had faſted twenty foure houres, by reaſon that his mother, who came up towards <hi>Dublin</hi> a weeke after her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, had no Milke left through faſting, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:95785:8"/>
feare and griefe, it pleaſed God, as ſhe laid her downe under the cleft of a Rocke, to be ſheltered all night from the ſharpe wind, ſhe found a little <hi>Iriſh</hi> Mader full of Butter-milke, or Bonny-clabber, whereby the babe was preſerved alive.</p>
            <p>And a common marke of providence is to be obſerved in that the enemy did not meddle with Maſter <hi>George Creighton,</hi> of <hi>Virginia,</hi> Miniſter, who relieved all commers, boyling barley and beefe, and other neceſſaries, night and day for that end.</p>
            <p>In other Counties they have killed divers Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Engliſh,</hi> after they have tortured them, and dragg'd them about. Yea, they have hewen ſome of them aſunder, as Maſter <hi>Madder</hi> neere <hi>Donganan,</hi> a Scottiſh Miniſter, and Maſter <hi>Drayton</hi> of <hi>Turneredge,</hi> an Engliſh Miniſter, and a good houſe-keeper. Some are their priſoners, as Maſter <hi>Hudſon</hi> and others. If zealous and painfull Maſter <hi>Robinſon,</hi> or honeſt Maſter <hi>Mors,</hi> late Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter nigh <hi>Bellturbet,</hi> (with many others) be now alive, they may juſtly cry out and conclude;

            <p>But to haſten. In the County of <hi>Monnohan,</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:95785:9"/>
Maſter <hi>Richard Cope,</hi> his Wife and Sonnes, <hi>Walter Cope</hi> Eſquire, his wife and children, <hi>Anthony Cope, Richard Blany,</hi> Maſter <hi>Branthwait,</hi> maſter <hi>Ralph Secum,</hi> his wife and children, with divers others, Eſquires, Miniſters, and Gentlemen of all ſorts, have they carryed away into <hi>Monnohan</hi> goale, and there keepe them cloſe priſoners, in the naſty and ſtinking Dungeon, threatning every day to hang them, or otherwiſe to deprive them of their lives. And their Maſſe-prieſts, thoſe ſowers of Tares, working upon the extremities of forlorne men, doe by all meanes poſſible, ſeeke to turne weake Chriſtians, to their ſuperſtitions, both by threats and promiſes, and prevaile with too many.</p>
            <p>But oh yee falſe ſeducers, <hi>Quae vos dementia coepit?</hi> Will yee not ceaſe to pervert the right wayes of the Lord? Helpe Lord, deliver the oppreſſed, to ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate thy praiſe and power. Reſcue ſuch as are appointed to dye, and in life endure worſe things then the moſt bitter death.

            <p>And for this your owne Backdoore of <hi>Ireland,</hi> for your owne ſakes, have a care now in moſt needfull time. They are guilty of much innocent bloud, and have broken the oath of their God, I meanethe oath of Alleagiance towards our Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne King.

            <p>Sometimes to omit the puniſhment, is to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the offence. There is a cruelty in ſome kind of mercy, though there be no mercy in crueltie. Our goods by them forcibly taken and detained, together with their goods and eſtates, in juſtice will become a prey to you. And feare not them for they ſhall even be bread for you. Their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence is departed from them, and the Lord is with us; Their ſinnes are full ripe, it is time for God to put in his ſickle. Religion is the greateſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to a Chriſtian mind: Let them not ever in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult, and ſay we have prevailed: Bring not that curſe upon your ſoules denounced, <hi>Iudges</hi> the 5. and Verſe 23. Curſe yee, curſe yee them bitterly, that came not to the helpe of the Lord againſt the wicked: who have in a trice laid waſt thoſe hopefull Plantations in the County of <hi>Cavan, Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mannagh, Tyrone, Ardmagh, Longford, Letrim, Mone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hans,</hi>

with divers others which have beene thirty yeares in Planting, and now for the greateſt part utterly ſupplanted. They are alſo out in Rebellion in the Counties of <hi>Derry, Donogull, Downe, Louthe,</hi> and <hi>Antrim,</hi> and the greateſt part of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in all theſe Counties utterly impoveriſhed by them.</p>
            <p>Alſo in the Counties of <hi>Sligo, Reſecoman, West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meath, Eaſt-meath,</hi> the King and Queenes Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> are much ſpoyled by them: So that the Goods and treaſure which thoſe Aſſaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinates have taken from the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in the three Provinces, of <hi>Vlſter, Lynſter,</hi> and <hi>Conaught,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts to a very great invaluable ſumme.</p>
            <p>True it is, that in ſeverall Counties, many of the beſt ſort are in reſtraint with them, as Sir <hi>Edward Travers,</hi> Captaine <hi>Smith,</hi> the Lord Biſhop of <hi>Kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, Blanys</hi> Lady, and his Siſters, the Lord <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field, Edward Philpot</hi> Eſquire, Miſtreſſe <hi>Moynes</hi> the elder, <hi>Roger Moynes</hi> Eſquire, his wife and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and very many others. And hereupon many thinke, if any forces proceed againſt them, that then they will wreake their utmoſt malice on theſe.</p>
            <p>But others conceive, that in regard they know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they cannot poſſibly now (ſince their

To whom be honour and glory, now and for ever.</p>
