         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>WHen your Deſires were once and
again ſignified to me, of having
this Diſcourſe publiſhed, it became not me to
Diſpute them, eſpecially in ſuch a Seaſon,
and in ſuch Circumſtances to which nothing
is to be denyed, and therefore I preſently
reſolv'd to Comply, tho' I was not Ignorant
at the ſame time how hazardous a Proof I
muſt give of my Obedience.</p>
            <p>For tho' Sermons of this kind are not ſo
liable to Cenſure as others, becauſe if they be
plain and practical, 'tis all that is expected
from them, and Allowances are generally
made for thoſe Deficiencies of Language,
Method and Reading, which would hardly

have no Hope.</q>

            <p>THeſe Words are an Introduction to a ſhort
Diſcourſe which St. <hi>Paul</hi> makes concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Certainty of a Reſurrection, and
the manner thereof, by which he Endeavours to
rectifie the Miſtakes of ſome concerning a Future
State, and thereby moderate their Griefs for their
Deceaſed Friends, which it ſeems were too often
wont to be ſo exceſſive and inordinate, as did not
at all become thoſe that had ſuch Hopes.</p>
            <p>The Occaſion of them this, The Saints at <hi>Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalonica</hi>
were ſorely perſecuted by the Unbelieving
Jews, (as is hinted in ſeveral places of this Epiſtle)
and many of them no doubt put to Death; which
proving great Diſcouragements to thoſe New Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts,
St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells them, that God's Wrath would
ſhortly ſeize upon thoſe wicked Enemies of theirs,
and then they ſhould be delivered from thoſe Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
and Afflictions which at preſent they lay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der:
And as for thoſe of their Fellow-Chriſtians,
who had already loſt their Lives for the ſake of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:102852:4"/>
their Religion,<note place="margin">Zanch. <hi>&amp;</hi> Ham.</note> (for ſome imagine ſuch are here
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>
not be too much ſolicitous for, or perplex'd about;
for if they did believe that Chriſt dyed and roſe
again, (which great Article of Faith they all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd)
the ſame Aſſurance had they likewiſe of
their Reſurrection at the laſt. And becauſe the
ſeveral kinds of Death to which they were expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
might a little ſtartle their Belief, and increaſe
their Sorrows; for they were ſometimes commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the Flames, and their Aſhes ſcattered up
and down in all places, (their Enemies fondly
thinking thereby to quaſh their Hopes of a Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.)
Sometimes they were caſt to the Lyons,
and other Beaſts of Prey, to be devoured by them,
and ſometimes their Carkaſſes thrown into the Sea,
for the Fiſh to feed on; their ſurviving Friends, tho'
they might be well enough ſatisfied of the State of
their Souls, might yet poſſibly be too ſolicitous for
their Bodies, what ſhould become of them, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they that were thus mangled were capable of
a reſtauration: To Obviate which, the Apoſtle
ſhews, that ſuch ſhall be no loſers by the Injuries
that have been offered them, for they ſhall not
only be raiſed as entire as thoſe that dyed a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Death, but as a ſpecial Reward of their Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom,
ſhall have the Priviledge to riſe before
the reſt, this be intimates <hi>Ver. 16. When the Lord
himſelf ſhall deſcend from Heaven with a ſhout, and
the Voice of the Arch-Angel, and with the Trump of God,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:102852:4"/>
the Dead in Chriſt,</hi> [or thoſe that dyed for Chriſt]
<hi>ſhall riſe firſt:</hi> Nay, even thoſe which are found <hi>alive</hi>
at the Coming of our Lord, ſhall not have the ſtart
of thoſe Martyr'd Saints, ſo as firſt to meet their
Saviour, and receive their Crown, this he aſſures
them <hi>ver. 15. For this we ſay unto you by the Word of
the Lord;</hi> as much as if he had ſaid, I do not ſpeak
it according to my own Fancy or Private Opinion,
but as I had it by Revelation, <hi>That we which are alive,
and remain unto the Coming of our Lord, ſhall not prevent
them which are aſleep;</hi> i.e. be caught up before them,
to congratulate firſt our returning Lord, and be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded
by him; and having thus evinc'd the Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of a Reſurrection, he concludes thus, <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
comfort ye one another with theſe Words.</hi> But though
we ſhould grant, that the Word may be more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently
underſtood of thoſe that dye for Chriſt, and
ſuffer Martyrdom for his ſake; yet they ſeem to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
a larger Interpretation, and to be extended to
all that <hi>are Chriſt's,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 23. for thoſe which
are here ſaid to be <hi>aſleep,</hi> are oppos'd to thoſe which
are <hi>alive:</hi> And beſides, if they were to be reſtrained
to thoſe only that thus ſuffered, then the Apoſtle's
Argument for the Conſolation of Chriſtians, would
only be ſerviceable to ſuch, whoſe Friends were of
that Happy and Illuſtrious Number. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I ſhall take the Words in the more General
Sence, and then we have in them theſe three Parts:</p>
            <p>1. St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Deſire to inform the Ignorance, and
rectifie the Miſapprehenſions of the Saints of <hi>Theſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonica,</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:102852:5"/>
concerning the State of the Dead, of ſuch as
had laid down their Lives for the ſake of Chriſt,
and indeed of all that truly believe in him; <hi>I would
not have you to be ignorant, Brethren, concerning them which
are aſleep;</hi> it is a Matter of great Importance, and
therefore would not have you lye under any Doubts
or Miſtakes herein, but deſire you may have as
full an Underſtanding of the thing, as the Goſpel
Revelation will afford you,</p>
            <p>2. The Deſign which the Apoſtle had in clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up theſe Notions to them, and that was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
thoſe Exceſſive Griefs and Inordinate Sorrows,
which they had conceived upon the Account of their
Departed Friends, for want of a right Apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and ſteady Belief hereof.</p>
            <p>3. We have this Sorrow more particularly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd,
<hi>viz.</hi> It was like theirs who had <hi>no Hope;</hi>
Such who either abſolutely denied the Immortality
of the Soul, and the Certainty of a Future State, as
the <hi>Sadduces</hi> among the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the <hi>Epicureans</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the <hi>Gentiles:</hi> Or, ſuch who had but faint Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions
and doubtful Gueſſes thereof, as the
Generality of the Heathens, who had no other Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
herein but the Light of Nature. No Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to ſee ſuch vent their Sorrows in an Extravagant
Manner, when all their Hopes were terminated on
this ſide the Grave, and when once gone, they fear'd
there was to be no more Remembrance of them or
their Friends for ever.</p>
            <p>To bring the Words down to our Purpoſe, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:102852:5"/>
them into theſe three Propoſitions:</p>
            <p>1. That there is a certain Meaſure of Sorrow al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable
to a Chriſtian, at the Death of his Friends.</p>
            <p>2. That Exceſſive or Immoderate Sorrow, be the
Loſs never ſo heavy, is much unbecoming the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Temper, and very unſuitable to thoſe Hopes
which he profeſſes to have; <hi>I would not have you ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
like<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> others that have no Hopes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. That a right Underſtanding, and a due Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of what our Religion offers in ſuch Caſes, is the
moſt effectual Method for the ſuppreſſing of all thoſe
Inordinate Paſſions. This I gather from the former
part of the Text, <hi>I would not have you to be ignorant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
them that are aſleep;</hi> as if he had ſaid, Had you
but right Apprehenſions of what the Goſpel aſſures
you herein, you would not be thus ſorrowful.</p>
            <p>To begin with the Firſt,</p>
            <p>1. That there is a certain Meaſure of Grief and
Sorrow allowed to the Chriſtian, at the Death of his
Friend: This is clearly implyed in the Words, for
the Apoſtle by telling them, that they ſhould <hi>not ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
as thoſe that had no Hope,</hi> does at the ſame time in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate,
there muſt be ſome Allowance made, that
Chriſtianity did not deſign to extirpate our Paſſions,
but only to moderate and correct them, to keep
them from thoſe Exceſſes which would diſparage
our Reaſon, and put the Soul into an Unquiet State.
'Tis true, there is no Command in the Goſpel for
this, becauſe the Practice hereof has no Inherent
Goodneſs in it, but argues rather the Debility and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:102852:6"/>
Weakneſs of Humane Nature; however the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
and Expediency of ſuch a Sorrow, cannot
in the leaſt be doubted, and this will appear,</p>
            <p>1. From the Examples of many Pious and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout
Perſons, who upon ſuch Occaſions have vent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
their Griefs, without ever having them changed
upon them as Crimes or Indecencies: We find <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi>
renting his Cloaths, putting Sackcloath upon his
Loyns, mourning bitterly for his Son many days,
whom he ſuppoſed to have been ſlain, and refuſing
to be comforted, <hi>Gen.</hi> 37. 34. We read again of
<hi>Joſeph</hi> and his Brethren, making ſuch a Lamentation
for their Father <hi>Jacob,</hi> that the <hi>Canaanites</hi> charged the
Name of the Place, to be a perpetual Remembrance
of their Sorrow, <hi>Gen. 50. 11. David,</hi> whoſe Thoughts
ſeem'd mightily to be raiſed above the little Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments
of this Life, doth not look upon it as any
Derogation to his Piety, to be the chieſ Mourner at
the Death of <hi>Saul,</hi> and his Beloved <hi>Jonathan;</hi> how
Pathetical his Grief was, may be ſeen in that Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Song he compoſed for that purpoſe, in 2 <hi>Sam.
1ſt.</hi> Chap. Nay, he doth indulge his Paſſion ſo far,
as to lament the Tragical End of his Rebellious Son
<hi>Abſalom,</hi> in a moſt unuſual ſtrain, <hi>O my ſon Abſalom,
my ſon, my ſon Abſalom, would to God I had dyed for thee;
O Abſalom my ſon, my ſon;</hi> and yet we find him not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
for it by God or his Prophet, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.
33. Nay higher yet, our Bleſſed Saviour, who
never did any thing amiſs, bears a part with the
<hi>Jews</hi> in their mourning for <hi>Lazarus;</hi> for when he
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:102852:6"/>
ſaw <hi>Mary,</hi> and the reſt of the Company, lamenting
the Loſs of her Brother, <hi>He</hi> Likewiſe <hi>groan'd in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and was troubled;</hi> but when he approaches nearer
to the Grave, his Sorrows found a Vent, our Dear
Lord is then ſaid to have wept, <hi>John</hi> 11. 35. and
whether he did this out of Affection to his Friend, or
upon the account of the <hi>Jews</hi> Incredulity, or ſome
other Conſideration, as ſome are apt to think, we
are ſure the Standers by took it in the firſt Senſe;
for in the Verſe after, they ſay, <hi>Behold how he loved
him!</hi> What ſhall I ſay more? God himſelf is ſaid
to be grieved and troubled at the Death of his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and is ſet forth by the Prophets, moſt paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
reſenting the Loſs of any of them, and when
their Iniquities had forc'd him to deſtroy them, how
pathetically doth he expreſs the Conflicts he had
within; <hi>How ſhall I give thee up, Ephraim? how ſhall I
deliver thee, Iſrael? my Heart is turned within me, my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentings
are kindled together,</hi> Hoſea 11. 8.</p>
            <p>2. As the Lawfulneſs of bewailing the Death of
our Friends, is thus to be juſtified from Inſtances,
ſo out of Complyance with our Natural Frailties,
which muſt neceſſarily be allowed ſuch Excurſions;
for being Creatures, compounded of groſs, earthy
Bodies, as well as pure immaterial Souls, we ſhall
unavoidably be ſenſible of Calamities, Afflictions,
Loſſes, and what greater than thoſe of a Real
Friend; ſo that Sorrow and Anguiſh will take hold
of us, as long as we have Humane Paſſions and
Affections to gratify; for <hi>our ſtrength is not the ſtrength
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:102852:7"/>
of ſtones, or our fleſh of braſs,</hi> as <hi>Job</hi> expoſtulates the
Caſe. And as Humanity requires it, ſo Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
does indulge it; tho' that indeed tends much to
the raiſing up our Thoughts to higher Objects, yet
it doth not oblige us to a ſtupid Regardleſsneſs of
our Concerns here below, or intend wholly to diveſt
us of our Paſſions, ſuch a Temper befiting rather a
ſullen Stoick, than a tender-hearted Chriſtian; and
therefore we are allowed not only to be ſenſible of,
but to complain and weep for our Loſſes, tho' never
to murmure or repine: Nay, <hi>Seneca</hi> himſelf, who
was much of the Stoical Humour, could ſay, <hi>Nobis
ignoſci poteſt prolapſis ad lacrymas, ſi non nimiae decurrerint;</hi>
That <hi>Tears might be excuſed,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Epi. 63. Inter ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empla eo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum fui quos do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor vicit.</note> 
               <hi>if they did not flow down in
too great abundance:</hi> And he tells us in the ſame
Epiſtle, what his own Carriage was at the Death
of his Dear Friend <hi>Annaeus Serenus:</hi> I, ſaith he, <hi>was
of the Number of thoſe whom Grief overcame:</hi> Nature, it
ſeems, was there too ſtrong for his Philoſophy, tho'
at other times none outbraves the Misfortunes of
Life, or the Terrors of Death at a higher Rate, as if
they had not the leaſt Power to move his Wiſe Man.</p>
            <p>3. Such Sorrows are the proper intimations of
our Love to the deceaſed Perſon, they are the laſt
Expreſſions of Kindneſs to our Friend, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
very allowable; there being no wayes ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
of ſhewing our Value and Eſteem for them.
Hence it was a Cuſtom among the <hi>Jews,</hi> and ſome
part of the Gentile World, to ſet apart ſuch a Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Time for theſe Mournful Exerciſes, in which
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:102852:7"/>
'twas accounted diſhonourable and inhumane, to
ſet about other Concerns, and therefore ſayes the
wiſe Son of <hi>Sirach, Weep bitterly for the dead, and make
great moan, and uſe lamentation, as he is worthy, leſt thou
be evil ſpoken of,</hi> Eccleſ. 38. 17. <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us,
there is <hi>a Time to Mourn, and a Time to Weep,</hi> as well
as for other Actions, and that every thing is beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
in its ſeaſon, therefore none ſo fit for this as
the Loſs of our Friends. When God forbad <hi>Ezekiel</hi>
to Mourn for his dead Wife, and to omit thoſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
of Sorrow which were then in uſe, the
People were preſently amaz'd at this thing, and
therefore came to him and ſaid, <hi>Wilt thou not tell us
what theſe things are to us that thou doſt ſo?</hi> Ezek. 24.
29. They concluded God had ſome further mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by this unuſual Behaviour of his Prophet, as it
fell out afterwards, or elſe at ſuch a time eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
he would never have forbore to <hi>Cover his Lips,
or Eat the Bread of Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. Sometimes God intends the Death of Friends,
as Tokens of his Diſpleaſure, and therefore our
Griefs are not only allowable, but highly requiſite
too; for in all the Puniſhment which he inflicts,
his Deſign is to make us ſenſible of the ſtroke, and
to humble us under the weight of the Affliction;
if it doth not this, God miſſes of the End of his Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
and by ſuch a Security and Unconcerned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
we do heighten his Diſpleaſure: When there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he takes away ſuch as are our greateſt Stay and
Support, the Delight of our Eyes, the Joy of our
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:102852:8"/>
Hearts, the Staff of our Age, or ſuch who were
Publick Bleſſings to the Neighbourhood where
they were, skilful to adviſe, and ready to aſſiſt;
then ſure the Almighty calls for Mourning and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation,
and expects we ſhould take Notice of
his Hand; therefore the Prophet upbraids the <hi>Jews</hi>
with their groſs Stupidity, that <hi>the Righteous</hi> ſhould
<hi>periſh, and no Man lay it to Heart;</hi> none moved at
it, none troubled for it, when it was deſign'd as a
publick Calamity, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57. 1.</p>
            <p>Upon theſe Accounts it muſt be Confeſs'd that
there is a certain Meaſure of Sorrow allowed the
Chriſtian, at the Death of his Friends; Humanity
requires it, and Religion does indulge it.</p>
            <p>2. The next thing ariſing from the Words, is, that
Exceſſive or Immoderate Sorrow, be the Loſs in
this kind never ſo heavy, is much unbecoming the
Chriſtian, and very unſuitable to that Belief which
he profeſſes; This is expreſſed, <hi>I would not have you
ſorrow like thoſe that have no hope;</hi> i.e. like ſuch who
either deny the Immortality of the Soul, and ſcoff
at the Reſurrection of the Body, who thought
the Grave made an everlaſting ſeparation between
them and their Friends, and when the fatal ſtroke
was once given, the <hi>Spirit vaniſhed as the ſoft ayre,</hi>
and there was not poſſibility of a return, or elſe
doubted of a Future State: No wonder to ſee ſuch
indulge their Paſſions to the utmoſt; but the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
who has ſuch great Aſſurances of a Future Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
betrays his Weakneſs, and diſparages his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:102852:8"/>
if he ſuffer his Griefs to exceed the Bounds
of Prudence and Moderation.—Now by this
immoderate Sorrow I mean, that which is unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable,
as to the Duration and Continuance, or to
the meaſures and degrees thereof.</p>
            <p>1. That which offends as to the Duration, is,
when too great a ſhare of our Time is laid out this
way; when like ſome fond Perſons, we conſume
Years in thoſe unprofitable Complaints, and refuſe
to be comforted, becauſe our Friends are not. Some
Time indeed muſt be allotted thoſe tender Paſſions,
Cuſtom and Decency will exact ſome, and the
Worth or Nearneſs of the Decaſed will require more;
but to ſpend our days in Trouble, and our years in
Vanity, becauſe that hath happened to thy Friend,
which muſt e're long befall thy ſelf, to whom
'twas as natural to dye as to be born, is not only
fooliſh in it ſelf, but injurious to thy own Quiet, and
diſpleaſing to Heaven. Much more advis'd was the
Method that <hi>David</hi> took, who when his ſick Child
dyed, aroſe from the Earth, waſhed and anointed
himſelf, and changed his Apparel, upon this Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
<hi>Wherefore ſhould I now afflict my ſelf, can I
bring him back again, I ſhall go to him, but he ſhall not return
to me,</hi> 2 Sam. 12. 23.</p>
            <p>2. As our Sorrows may be faulty as to their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance,
ſo may they be as to the Meaſures and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
thereof, they may ſoon exceed the Bounds of
a Chriſtian Behaviour, and this is when they vent
themſelves in loud Outcries and Exclamations, in
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:102852:9"/>
paſſionate Expreſſions, and oblique Reflections up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
God's Adminiſtration of things, in publiſhing our
Calamities to all that are near us, and tiring them
with our Complaints: Or, when it is ſo outragious, as
to drive us to fooliſh and indecent Carriages, as was
the manner of the Heathens; who us'd to make la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable
Howlings for their Dead, to beſmear their
Faces, to cut their own Fleſh, and ſometimes to ſlay
their Beaſts, or their Slaves, to accompany the Ghoſts
of their Deceaſed Friends. Or again, when we are ſo
intent upon our Loſs, as wholly to neglect our own
Affairs, when in a ſullen, diſcontented Mood, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
neither our ſelves, nor any Concern of Life, and
refuſe to partake of any of thoſe Mercies Providence
has bleſs'd us with, becauſe we are croſs'd in this;
as if we could not teſtify our Affections, unleſs we
did ſacrifice our Health and Enjoyment, our Peace
and Comfort, to the Memory of thoſe who neither
regarded what we did, nor received any advantage
by theſe ſupererogatory Works of ours: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
St. <hi>Jerom</hi> deſervedly reproved the Religious
<hi>Paula,</hi> becauſe at the Death of any of her Children,
the greatneſs of her Sorrow brought her even to the
Brink of the Grave; <hi>Take no heavineſs to Heart,</hi> ſays
the wiſe <hi>Jew, drive it away, and remember the laſt end;
forget it not, for there is no turning again; thou ſhalt not
do him good, but hurt thy ſelf,</hi> Eccle. 38. 20, 21. As
if he had ſaid, let the Contemplation of thy own
Mortality make thee to ſpare thy ſelf, you are ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to ſubmit to the ſame Fate, and therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:102852:9"/>
ſome Pity for your ſelf, and be not ſo Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant
in the bemoaning of thoſe, who are either
Bleſſed, and ſo need it not, or paſt a Recovery, and
ſo deſerve it not.</p>
            <p>Some Loſſes, 'tis confeſs'd, may make a deeper
Impreſſion than other, according to the Worth of
the Perſon, the nearneſs of the Relation, or the need
we had of his Aſſiſtance, in ſuch Caſes quicker and
deeper Reſentments may be allowed; but be it as
afflictive as we can imagine, it will not juſtifie the
Chriſtian to exceed the Bounds of Decency, he muſt
<hi>not ſorrow as thoſe that have no hope:</hi> For,</p>
            <p>1. Such Sorrows are uſeleſs and unprofitable, and
therefore not fit Buſineſs for a Chriſtian to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
in long, who has Work of far greater Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
before him, ſuch deſigns to bring about, that he
can ſpare but little leiſure for Trifles, or afford to
conſume his Time and Strength in that which is
impertinent, unattainable.</p>
            <p>If my Friend was Good and Virtuous, he is alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
poſſeſs'd of a far greater meaſure of Happineſs,
than what this World could beſtow, and there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
in a joyful Expectation of a fuller Bliſs at the
Reſtitution of his Body: And therefore, why ſuch
Outcries and Direful Complaints, for the Departure
of that Soul which is now Triumphing, glad it hath
got looſe from a vain, troubleſome, wicked World,
and you grieve it was a Priſoner here no longer. If
ſuch Bleſſed Spirits did behold thoſe Scenes of Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
which are uſually acted here below, they
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:102852:10"/>
would pity our miſtaken Zeal; and be ready to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeak
their Mourners, as our Saviour did the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
which followed him to his Crucifixion, <hi>Weep
not for me, but for your ſelves,</hi> and your Relations that
ſurvive; we are happy, and have paſs'd thoſe Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities
which you that remain in the Body muſt
ſtill conflict with. If again, the Perſon we vent
our Sighs and Complaints for, was vain and uſeleſs,
liv'd Vicious and Ungodly, and dyed without giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any tolerable Hopes of a ſincere Repentance;
he is gone to his place, neither our Tears nor our
Pennances are of any Efficacy, for the remitting of
his Puniſhment, or for bringing him back to live over
another Life, to correct the Errours of the former; it
coſts more to redeem their Souls, ſo that we muſt be
forc'd to let that alone for ever: And indeed thoſe
that are ſuch, are unworthy of our Sorrows, how In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate
or Dear ſoever they have been before; they
cannot much deſerve our Pity, who did not deſerve
it at the Hands of our Merciful Father. Thus <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
is ſaid to be comforted, within a while after the
Death of his Son <hi>Amnon,</hi> though the circumſtances
thereof were lamentable enough, poſſibly upon the
Conſideration of his being ſo Lewd and Diſſolute a
Perſon, and therefore not deſerving to be the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of any long continued Sorrow; and we find, 'tis
put down among the Puniſhments of ſuch, that <hi>The
memory of the wicked ſhall rot;</hi> ſo that in both reſpects,
ſuch inordinate Griefs are uſeleſs and inſignificant.</p>
            <p>2. They are likewiſe ſelfiſh, and therefore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becoming
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:102852:10"/>
a Chriſtian, who is to be acted by higher
Principles: Self-love is uſually at the bottom of
thoſe exceſſive Sorrows, whatever pretences of Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
we make to them; for thoſe violent Paſſions
are ſeldom exerciſed, but when our own Intereſt is
concern'd, and therefore ſuch complain not ſo much
that their Friend is gone, as that they are left, that
they are deprived of his Society, and of thoſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
they received thereby; Or, that they muſt now
deſpair of thoſe Helps and Aſſiſtances they expected
from him; and ſo 'tis not properly their Friend's Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
but their own Evils and Inconveniencies
which they deplore; for with ſuch the Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
ſooneſt goes off, when they are ſupplied
with Comforts and Aſſiſtances elſewhere. If, I ſay,
the Cauſe of ſuch extream Paſſions were ſearch'd
into, they would uſually be found to reſolve into
this at the laſt; whereas true Chriſtian Sorrow has
leſs of Noiſe and Pomp in it, is more even and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate,
and ariſes from other Conſiderations.</p>
            <p>3. Such immoderate Griefs very often proceed
from a murmuring and diſcontented Spirit, which
muſt never be allowed the Chriſtian, be the Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
never ſo ſevere; they argue a Repining at the
Diſpenſations of Providence: Hence it is, that thoſe
who give their Paſſions ſo much Liberty, ſeldom
forbear venting themſelves in unhandſome Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
upon the Divine Providence: Or however,
ſecretly tax it of Injuſtice or Partiality, in the mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
of Affairs here below.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:102852:11"/>
4. They do manifeſtly betray a great defect in
our Faith, that we are not ſo fully convinc'd of the
certainty of a future Being as we ought, that we give
but too ſlight a Credit to what the Scripture has in
ſuch a caſe propos'd as the chief Support, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we <hi>ſorrow as thoſe that have no hope;</hi> for were we
firmly perſwaded of an Immortality afterwards, and
the immediate Happineſs of thoſe that ſleep in Jeſus,
with how calm and compos'd a Mind ſhould we
bear the Loſs: It is for thoſe to fill the Air with
Shrieks and Lamentations, that uſed to give their
<hi>Aeternum Vale</hi> to the Aſhes of their Friends: But the
Pious Chriſtian, by the help of his Faith, can eaſily
view Eternity on the other ſide the Grave; for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
he alone partakes of thoſe glorious Hopes,
thoſe great Aſſurances, which can render him truly
Triumphant at ſuch a time: This brings me to the
laſt Propoſition, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That a right Underſtanding, and due
Conſideration of what the Goſpel offers in ſuch ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
is the moſt effectual Method for ſuppreſſing all
thoſe inordinate Paſſions: This St. <hi>Paul</hi> intimates,
by theſe Words, <hi>I would not have you ignorant, Brethren,
concering thoſe that are aſleep;</hi> as if he had ſaid, Had
you but clear Apprehenſions of what the Chriſtian
Religion delivers, concerning the State of your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed
Friends, your Griefs would never be ſo exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive,
you would never behave your ſelves in ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decent,
ſo deſpairing a manner, as thoſe poor <hi>Gentiles</hi>
do with whom you converſe, who have not as yet
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:102852:11"/>
embraced the Doctrine of our Saviour; for as they
are <hi>without God,</hi> ſo they are <hi>without Hope</hi> in the World.
And now what that great <hi>Catholicon</hi> or univerſal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
is, which the Goſpel propoſes as the chief Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,
the Apoſtle delivers in the Verſes after; <hi>For if
we believe that Jeſus died, and roſe again, even ſo them alſo
which ſleep in Jeſus ſhall God bring with him: For the
Lord himſelf ſhall deſcend from Heaven with a ſhout, with
the Voice of the Arch-Angel, and with the Trump of God,
and the dead in Chriſt ſhall riſe firſt; then we which are
alive and remain, ſhall be caught up together with them in
the Clouds, to meet the Lord in the Air, and ſo ſhall we ever
be with the Lord.</hi> This is a brief Deſcription of the
Chriſtian's Hope, the great Foundation upon which
all his Comforts are built, and indeed nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
this can vanquiſh the fears of Death, or ſcatter
all thoſe black and melancholly Thoughts that are
apt to ſeize us, either at our own or our Friend's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
Fate. And now the certainty of this, is
to be fetch'd only from the Goſpel; never had the
World ſo full a Demonſtration of theſe important
Truths, 'till our Saviour came, and <hi>brought Life and
Immortality to light.</hi> All beſides, might be truly ſaid
to be <hi>without hope;</hi> for though they might make
ſome imperfect Gueſſes at a future State, by the Light
of Reaſon, yet their Notions were ſo obſcure, and
their Opinions about if ſo various, that they could
neither ſatisfie themſelves nor others about a Matter
of ſo great Concernment: But whatever they might
think of the Soul, yet the Reſurrection of the Body
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:102852:12"/>
was a thing quite beyond their Reach and Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion,
and indeed contrary to the Principles of
their Philoſophy; the compleat Knowledge of this,
was purely the Effect of the Goſpel Manifeſtation,
ſo that the utmoſt their Fancies could extend to, was
but a partial imperfect Happineſs, in reſpect of what
the Chriſtian is aſſur'd of. But alas! the Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
went not ſo far, the common Cry with them
was much like the Arguings of thoſe Fools in the
Book of <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> Chap. 2. <hi>Our life is ſhort and tedious,
and in the death of man there is no remedy, neither was there
any man known to have returned from the Grave, for we
are born at all adventure, and we ſhall be hereafter as though
we bad never been, for the breath in our noſtrils is as ſmoak,
and a little ſpark in the moving of our heart, which being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh'd,
our body ſhall be turned into aſhes, and our ſpirit
ſhall vaniſh as the ſoft Air: Our time is a very ſhadow that
paſſeth away, and after our End there is no returning, for
it is faſt ſealed, ſo that no man cometh again.</hi> Thus it
was with them, and truly it was little otherwiſe
with their Grave and Learned Philoſophers, though
they made ſuch great Flouriſhes, and ſome of them
talk'd loftily about the Joys of the ſeparate Soul, yet
they were ſo extravagant in their Fancies, and ſome
of them ſo inconſiſtent with themſelves, when they
had Occaſion to diſcourſe on this Subject, that we
may eaſily imagine they were at a Loſs, and not
much ſatisfied themſelves, in that which they taught
the common People to believe: Inſomuch, that
<hi>Socrates,</hi> who was as great an Inſtance of Virtue and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:102852:12"/>
Learning, as the <hi>Gentile</hi> World could produce, yet
towards the latter End of his Life, plainly confeſſes
his Ignorance in this thing; for when he came to
plead his cauſe before his Judges, and largely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes
of the Happy State of good Men hereafter,
at laſt frankly owns,<note place="margin">Apol. So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crat. a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pud Plat.</note> that he could be content <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
to dye over and over, was he but aſſured of the
reality of what he had ſo often aſſerted; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
receiving his Sentence, concludes his Apology
in this doubtful manner, <hi>I am now leaving the World, 'tis
your Lot to live, and mine to dye, but whether of us two ſhall
fare the better; i.e.</hi> (whether there be any Exiſtence on
the other ſide the Grave) <hi>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, is unknown
to all but God alone;</hi> ſo little Confidence had that great
Man even at ſuch a time, when he ſhould have been
conſtant to his former Reaſonings, and magnified
his own Philoſophy. Hence we may ſafely affirm
of a great part of them, what the Author of the
Book of <hi>Wiſdom</hi> ſays, that <hi>As for the Myſteries of God,
they know them not, neither hoped they for the wages of
Righteouſneſs, nor diſcern'd a Reward for blameleſs Souls.</hi>
And now being thus wavering in their Minds, and
unfix'd as to their Reſolutions about an Immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
what was there left to fortifie them againſt the
fears of Dying? Nature is apt to ſtartle at the
thoughts of a Diſſolution, even then when it is aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
it ſerves but as a Paſſage to that Life which
ſhall never end; but when it looks upon it as the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
Period of their Being, as that which crumbles
them into Duſt, without any poſſibility of a return,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:102852:13"/>
what Reflections can be more diſmal or amazing:
And therefore, to prepare themſelves the better for
the fatal ſtroak, they invented many pretty Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thegms
and Paradoxes, furniſhed themſelves with
ſome Common Topicks or Witty Sayings, that ſo
they might have ſome Relief againſt their own or
their Friends Departure: But alas! they are all of
them but poor Receipts, in reſpect of that Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Antidote which the Goſpel preſcribes. To
inſtance in ſome of their choiceſt;</p>
            <p>Sometimes they would ſay, that <q rend="margQuotes">Death was
the unavoidable Fate of all Mankind, that there
was no reſiſting the Power of it, they ſaw that
wiſe Men dyed as well as Fools, and therefore it
was their Prudence not to be concern'd at that
which no ways could be avoided.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Again, <q rend="margQuotes">It was a common Calamity, we every
day meet with Remembrances of Mortality, and
ſhould ſuch thoughts diſcompoſe us, our Life
would be a continual Vexation.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Sometimes they would uſe this little Sophiſtry,
<q rend="margQuotes">That Death cannot hurt us, becauſe when that is
we are not, and when we are that is abſent, ſo is
a thing that does not at all belong to us, and if
perhaps there be any pain at the laſt Separation of

This was the great Retreat <hi>Epicurus</hi> and his Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
betook themſelves to.</p>
            <p>Sometimes they would argue after this Rate,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:102852:13"/>
               <q rend="margQuotes">That we are dead already as to ſo much of our Life
which is paſt and gone, for ſo much as we live, ſo
much we dye, being dead to the day paſt, and
that which we uſually call Death is but our laſt
Death, and therefore as we did not fear our former
Death, why ſhould we that which is to come.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Another little Hold they had was, <q rend="margQuotes">That they

            <p>Others would Comfort themſelves after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
<q rend="margQuotes">That Death was a deſirable thing, ſeeing there

The eaſying and disburthening us of all our
Cares and Fears, the letting us looſe from an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm

               <note place="margin">Conſo. ad Marci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am, <hi>Sect.</hi> 19.</note> This is <hi>Seneca</hi>'s laſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge:
For tho' he ſometimes ſeems to intimate a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
of a Future State, yet he is quickly off again,
very inconſtant as to his Reſolutions in that Point,
and makes uſe of this as the chief Preſcription to allay
our Fears and Moderate our Griefs. Some in the
laſt place ſoar'd higher, and would ſolace themſelves
with the Thoughts, of the Soul's enjoying by Death
a true Freedom and Liberty, of its being received
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:102852:14"/>
into pleaſant delightful Manſions, and there parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
for a vaſt Tract of Time of ſuch Enjoyments
as were more ſuitable to its Nature: This was the
Opinion of the <hi>Platoniſts,</hi> but their Fancies in this
kind were ſo Extravagant, their Notions generally
ſo Obſcure, and their Diſcourſes ſo Romantick, that it
may very well be queſtion'd, whether they had thoſe
great Tranſports when they were about to exchange
this Priſon of the Body, for thoſe Airy Vehicles they
ſo much talk'd of.</p>
            <p>Nay, ſuch as profeſs'd moſt to own the Incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible
Nature of the Soul, and ſtedfaſtly to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
a Future State, yet ſuppoſed ſuch various
Tranſmigrations and Shiftings of the Soul from one
Body to another, as muſt needs be an abatement
of its Happineſs; becauſe by ſuch alterations, it
ſhould ſoon loſe all Knowledge both of its Friends
and it ſelf too.</p>
            <p>Theſe were the cheif Preſcriptions the Moraliſts
made uſe of, but alas how ſlight and feeble are they
in reſpect of that Lively Hope the Chriſtian is
poſſeſs'd of; with what Courage and Conſtancy
ſuch Notions might inſpire them I know not, but
certainly where Perſons find themſelves made for
higher Objects than what this World preſents, and
have a Conſciouſneſs of their own Eternity, nothing
can effectually compoſe the tumultuary Rovings of
that Mind, but the Aſſurances of an Immortality,
and of ſuch an Immortality only which the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:102852:14"/>
hopes for: Without this all the Notions of the
Phyloſophers and Sentences of the Moraliſts ſignifie
little, Death can never be vanquiſh'd by ſuch weak
Charms, but would be ſtill too hard for their Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
too ſtrong for their Reſolutions; they muſt
Sorrow even as thoſe that have no Hope: So that
the beſt of them paſs'd off the Stage rather in an
obſtinate, vain-glorious Humour, than in any true
Satisfaction or Triumph. But now the Chriſtian has
a far better Proviſion made him; for beſides the
Helps and Conſiderations he has in common with
the Phyloſophers, which he may ſerve himſelf of
when he pleaſes; his Religion offers him ſuch Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
as are ſufficient to repreſs all inordinate Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and compoſe our Minds into a ſteady Frame.</p>
            <p>It aſſures us of the reality of a Divine Providence in
the Managery of things here below, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
Affliction, Loſs or Calamity befalls us, was ſo
Ordered by an over-ruling Providence: This was
a Truth which the Gentile World either abſolutely
denyed, or however was not ſo well ſatisfied in as
to make any true Uſe of their Adverſities, or to be
Patient under them.—But now we know, that <hi>Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
ſprings not out of the duſt, nor trouble out of the
ground,</hi> that nothing falls upon us without the
Knowledge and Permiſſion of our Heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
who ſtill deſigns our Welfare by all the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
Methods and Diſpenſations he exerciſes towards
us, and therefore the Thoughts of this muſt needs
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:102852:15"/>
render us more Calm and Sedate at ſuch times,
than thoſe who can ſpy out nothing of Divine
Wiſdom and Goodneſs, but look upon all their
Croſſes as the Effects either of an ill Chance, or an
inevitable Fate.</p>
            <p>But more eſpecially doth it relieve our. Thoughts,
by giving us ſo great an Aſſurance of a happy State
hereafter, that not only the Soul, but the Body too,
ſhall live for ever, that the whole Man ſhall be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
and entirely raiſed, and Death at laſt be <hi>ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up in Victory;</hi> therefore thoſe that were Dead, are
ſaid in my Text only to be <hi>aſleep;</hi> and if we ſleep
we ſhall do well,<note place="margin">Joh. 11. 12.</note> as the Diſciples ſaid of <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus:</hi>
It is only a reſting for a while in our Dormito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
but we ſhall as certainly awake in the Morning
as ever we lay down—And this we are aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
of:</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>By many full and clear Teſtimonies in the
Scripture, of whoſe Divine Authority we have ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
undoubted Proofs: Here we are plainly told, that</hi>
the Hour is coming,<note place="margin">John 5. 28.</note> in which all that are in the Graves ſhall
bear, and ſhall come forth, they that have done good unto the
Reſurrection of life: <hi>Hear it is ſaid, that</hi> when our earthly
houſe of this tabernacle ſhall be diſſolved,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 1.</note> we have a building
of God, an houſe not made with hands, eternal in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens:
<hi>Here 'tis promiſed, that</hi> this Corruptible muſt put
on Incorruption,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 53.</note> and this Mortal muſt put on Immortality:
<hi>Nay, here in the Context we have a more particular
Deſcription of the Manner thereof, and in what Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it ſhall be.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:102852:15"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> But more eſpecially are we ſecur'd hereof
by the Reſurrection of our Bleſſed Saviour; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
St. <hi>Paul</hi> makes uſe of this Argument, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
in us theſe Hopes, as in the Verſe after my
Text; <hi>For if we believe that Jeſus dyed, and roſe again,
even ſo them alſo which ſleep in Jeſus will God bring
with him:</hi> As if he had ſaid, If once your Faith will
carry you ſo far, as to believe your Lord's Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
you need never doubt your own, this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Matter of Fact, ſurpaſſes all the Arguments
that could be drawn from any other Topick whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever:
For our Saviour dying in a Humane Capacity,
and being raiſed again, does clearly evince, that
we who are of the ſame Nature, are capable of
a like Reſtauration. This indeed is a ſenſible Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment
of the poſſibity of a Reſurrection; but now
that which was thus ſhewn to be poſſible, is made
alſo certain to us, from the Relation that is between
Chriſt and us, as he is the Head, and we are his
Members, and ſo ſhall be made Partakers of the
like Condition with him. So our Apoſtle elſewhere,
2 <hi>Cor. 4. 14. Knowing this, that he who raiſed up the Lord
Jeſus, ſhall raiſe us up alſo by Jeſus;</hi> of which we have
have an Earneſt by the Spirit he hath given us.
So our Apoſtle again, <hi>Rom. 8. 11. If the ſpirit of him
that raiſed up Jeſus from the dead dwell in you, he that
raiſed up Chriſt from the dead ſhall alſo quicken your mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
bodies, by the ſpirit that dwelleth in you:</hi> So that by
this Triumphant Action chiefly it is, that our Lord
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:102852:16"/>
has <hi>brought Life and Immortality to light,</hi> brought thoſe
Myſteries to a full View, which before lay hid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Types and Figures, or were only faintly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
by Natural Reaſon. And to give us a
further Aſſurance of the thing. He manifeſted his
Power before;<note place="margin">Mat. 27. 52.</note> for at his Death <hi>the Graves were open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and many bodies of Saints which ſlept aroſe, and came
out of their Graves after his Reſurrection, and appear'd
to many;</hi> intimating by that Releaſe of ſome few
Priſoners made then, what a general Goal-delivery
there ſhould be when he comes at laſt in his
Glory.</p>
            <p>And now upon a Review of all this, ſhall the
Chriſtian ſorrow like thoſe that have no Hope?
Shall he not be able to part with a Pious Friend or
Relation, but muſt he lament him as if loſt for ever?
How eaſily rather, may he at ſuch a time triumph
over Death, and cry out, <hi>Where is thy Sting? O
Grave, where is thy Victory?</hi> Where are all your Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phies?
the Body indeed you have ſeized on, but
that is only a Sacred <hi>Depoſitum,</hi> committed to your
Truſt for a time, you muſt make a faithful Reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it e're long; the Victory truly is ours, and God
hath given it us through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt: By
the help of this ſingle Conſideration, how often hath
Death been triumph'd over by the Primitive Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
who have been ſo tranſported with the thoughts
hereof, that they have been eager to quit this dull
Mortality before they were call'd, and to preſs upon
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:102852:16"/>
thoſe Eternal Manſions, before they had compleated
their Probation-ſhip here below; and yet we have
the ſame Arguments for the truth hereof as they, and
may have as ſtrong Evidences for our Title.</p>
            <p>However, if our Faith cannot inſpirit our Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions
ſo high, yet ſure it will be ſufficient to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
our Grief, to reſtrain the Inordinacy of our
Paſſions for our deceaſed Friends, eſpecially when
they are ſuch as ſleep in Jeſus, ſuch who are not
ſo much departed from us as gone before us, have
the Priviledge to go a little the ſooner to take
Poſſeſſion of that Glorious Inheritance, where they
joyfully expect the Conſummating of their Bliſs, as
well in the Redemption of their Bodies, as in the
being reſtored to thoſe Pious Friends they parted
with here.</p>
            <p>That this is the Condition of every true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
that is fallen aſleep, our Religion will not ſuffer
us to be ignorant of: And that it is now the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
ſtate of this Reverend Perſon, whoſe Obſequies
we at this time come to Celebrate, our Charity
eaſily teaches us to believe, and therefore we are
not to Sorrow as thoſe that have no Hope.</p>
            <p>Tho' indeed, if at any time our Paſſions might
be allowed to exceed the common Bounds, now
it is that Humane Frailty might expect to be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulg'd;
when one (who perhaps according to the
Compaſs of the Orb in which he moved, was as
uſeful to the Community as any beſides) has bid
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:102852:17"/>
adieu to the World, when it ſtood in great need
of ſuch Exemplary Piety and Conduct.</p>
            <p>But when again we Conſider, He was one of
thoſe of whom we have the greateſt Hopes, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Prudence is ſo to regulate our Deportment,
as that our Sorrow do neither betray the Weakneſs
of our Faith, nor imply too great a Fondneſs for
our ſelves.</p>
            <p>He was trained up in Religion under the early
Inſtructions of Careful Parents, and of a Father
equally Learned as Pious, the late Lord Biſhop of
<hi>Norwich:</hi> Had the farther Help of an Academical
Life in one of the chiefeſt Colledges of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity,
from whence he was removed to this Place,
where he was near forty Years a Faithful Paſtor,
that taught out of the Pulpit as well as in it, and
whoſe Converſation was a Comment upon his
Doctrine.</p>
            <p>The conſtant Tenour of his Actions evidently
ſhew'd, that Piety and a due Fear of Almighty
God was fix'd at the bottom; that he had right
Notions of Religion, and an awful Senſe of his Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
In the Management of which, he avoided all
thoſe little Arts and Deſigns, which many often
practice to obtain the Vogue and Applauſe of
others; for I could never perceive in him any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate
Zeal, or ſtudious affectation of Preciſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and Singularity, no Pretenſions to a higher
ſtrain of Purity than others; but Goodneſs in its
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:102852:17"/>
own Native Dreſs, every thing acted without Pomp
or Noiſe, (chooſing rather to be a Chriſtian in
earneſt, than ſtriving only to ſeem ſo) as being no
doubt ſufficiently ſatisfied with the Approbation of
that <hi>Judge which ſees in ſecret,</hi> and the Teſtimony of
that one Evidence which is above a thouſand Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes.
He had all along that great Probity and
Uprightneſs, and withall ſuch a ſweetneſs of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
as procur'd the Eſteem and Love of moſt that
knew him, and his Converſation he ſo prudently
temper'd, as render'd it agreeable to all that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd
it; for he knew how to be Chearful with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
being vain and light, and how to be Serious,
and not ſullen or moroſe.</p>
            <p>His great Meekneſs and Condeſcention added no
ſmall Luſtre to his other Accompliſhments, for here
appear'd not the leaſt Leaven of Pride to ſoure his
Converſation, no haughty, diſdainful Looks to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Inferiours, no fond affectation of Diſtance,
or Difficulty of Acceſs, but all along comporting
himſelf with that unſtrain'd Humility, as evidently
declar'd him to be a true Miniſter of his, who
own'd himſelf to be a Servant to all.</p>
            <p>How faithfully he deſcharged the ſeveral Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
he ſtood in, either as a Husband, a Parent,
or a Friend, is ſo evident to all that had an Inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy
with him, that I need only ſay, ſcarce great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Inſtances of Love, Tenderneſs and Sincerity are
now to be found. 'Tis confeſs'd, that neither his
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:102852:18"/>
Temper nor his Judgment, carried him up to the
Heighths and Violences of ſome Men, but yet he
well underſtood the Deſign of Religion, and the
Intereſt of our Church, and proved I dare ſay
more ſerviceable to both, than many that pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſtronger Zeal, or made a louder Noiſe: He
very well knew, a due Regard ſhould be had to
the Paſſions, Prepoſſeſſions and Infirmities of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Nature, the Conſideration whereof would
ſtill incline every-good Man to uſe ſuch gentle Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods,
as are moſt proper to accomodate lighter
Differences, and advance the main Ends of the
Goſpel. All Perſons are naturally conceited of their
own Notions, (eſpecially ſuch as reſpect Religion)
and nothing ſo ſoon overcomes thoſe Prejudices,
and unbinds the Charm, as a Candid Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their Miſtakes; whereas a furious Oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, creates either a greater Fondneſs for,

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſe only makes ſuch
Converts, as at the firſt Opportunity will turn our
Enemies, and ſtudy Revenges for their paſt Reſtraints.
However, if it was for nothing elſe but the Falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of Humane Judgment, and the Mutability
of Humane Affairs, a due Exerciſe of Moderation
would not be abſurd or inconvenient, but when it
ſeems to bear ſo near a Reſemblance to that <hi>Wiſdom
that deſcends from above,</hi> which is not only <hi>pure,</hi> but
<hi>peaceable, gentle, and eaſie to be entreated,</hi> we have no
reaſon to be aſham'd to own the thing, or afraid to
defend thoſe that lov'd it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:102852:18"/>
But whatever might be the Opinions of Others,
I make no Queſtion but You that were under his
Miniſterial Charge, to whom he was ſo long and
ſo well known, cannot but have a great Value and
Eſteem for his Memory, and therefore his Example
and his Doctrine ought to be ſtill of force with
You; for though he be <hi>dead,</hi> yet to you <hi>he ſtill
ſpeaks:</hi> The Unblameableneſs of his Life, and the
ſoundneſs of his Diſcourſes, will but aggravate
your Guilt, if you disobey the one, and forget the
other. Endeavour then ſo to be <hi>followers of him as
he was of Chriſt,</hi> that when you are to paſs into the
other World, you need not be afraid of meeting
with him, nor he aſham'd to own You; but there
Congratulating each other's ſafe Arrival, You may
increaſe the Triumph of your Faithful Conductor,
and procure for him that <hi>Aureola,</hi> or additional Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
that belongs to thoſe who <hi>turn many to Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs</hi>
—For indeed <hi>what is our Hope, or Joy, or
Crown of Rejoycing? are not even ye in the Preſence of
our Lord Jeſus Chriſt at his coming?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Death-Bed I may ſay was Eaſie to him,
though his Pains were very acute and tormenting;
for his Mind was quiet and ſedate, and that enabled
him to bear his Afflictions with a wonderful Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and Reſignation: There was nothing (as he
profeſs'd to me) that diſcompoſed his Spirit, or
made him fearful of Dying. And indeed, this was
but the Conſequence of his paſt Actions; for he

            <p>Seeing then we are not ignorant of this Perſon
who is now aſleep, we ought not, even ſuch as
