         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>I Believe in one God the Father<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

WHosoever will be saved: before all things, it is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
that he hold the Catholike faith.</p>
                  <p>Which faith except every one do keep wholly and
undefiled: without doubt he shall perish everlastingly.</p>
                  <p>And the Catholike faith is this: that we worship one God in
Trinity, and Trinity in Unity.</p>
                  <p>Neither confounding the persons: nor dividing the substance.</p>
                  <p>For there is one person of the Father, another of the Son, and
another of the holy Ghost.</p>
                  <p>But the Godhead of the Father, of the Son, and of the holy
Ghost, is all one: the glory equal, the Majesty coeternal.</p>
                  <p>Such as the Father is, such is the Son: &amp; such is the holy Ghost.</p>
                  <p>The Father uncreate, the Son uncreate, and the holy Ghost
uncreate.</p>
                  <p>The Father incomprehensible, the Son incomprehensible, and
the holy Ghost incomprehensible.</p>
                  <p>The Father eternal, the Son eternal, and the holy Ghost eternal.</p>
                  <p>And yet they are not three eternals: but one eternal.</p>
                  <p>As also there be not three incomprehensibles, nor three uncre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated:
but one uncreated, and one incomprehensible.</p>
                  <p>So likewise the Father is Almighty, the Son Almighty, and
the Holy Ghost Almighty.</p>
                  <p>And yet they are not three Almighties: but one Almighty.</p>
                  <p>So the Father is God, the Son is God, &amp; the holy Ghost is God.</p>
                  <p>And yet they are not three Gods: but one God.</p>
                  <p>So likewise the Father is Lord, the Son Lord, and the holy
Ghost Lord.</p>
                  <p>And yet not three Lords: but one Lord.</p>
                  <p>For like as we be compelled by the Christian verity, to
acknowledge every person by himself to be God and Lord.</p>
                  <p>So are we forbidden by the Catholike Religion, to say there
be three Gods, or three Lords.</p>
                  <p>The Father is made of none: neither Created, nor begotten.</p>
                  <p>The Son is of the Father alone: not made, nor created, but
begotten.</p>
                  <p>The holy Ghost is of the Father, and of the Son: neither made,
nor created, nor begotten, but proceeding.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="3" facs="tcp:41924:3"/>
So there is one Father, not three Fathers; one Son, not three
Sons; one holy Ghost, not three holy Ghosts.</p>
                  <p>And in this Trinity none is afore or after other, none is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
or less then another.</p>
                  <p>But the whole three persons be coeternal together, and coequal.</p>
                  <p>So that in all things, as is aforesaid, the Unity in Trinity, and
the Trinity in Unity is to be worshipped.</p>
                  <p>He therefore that will be saved: must thus think of the Trinity.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, it is necessary to everlasting salvation; that he
also believe rightly in the incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
                  <p>For the right faith is, that we believe and confess: that our
Lord Jesus Christ the Son of God, is God and man.</p>
                  <p>God of the substance of the Father, begotten before the worlds:
and man of the substance of his mother, born in the world.</p>
                  <p>Perfect God and perfect man: of a reasonable soul, and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
flesh subsisting.</p>
                  <p>Equal to the Father as touching his Godhead: and inferiour
to the Father touching his manhood.</p>
                  <p>Who although he be God and man: yet he is not two, but one
Christ.</p>
                  <p>One, not by Conversion of the Godhead into flesh, but by
taking of the manhood into God.</p>
                  <p>One altogether, not by confusion of substance, but by unity of
person.</p>
                  <p>For as the reasonable soul and flesh is one man: so God and
man is one Christ.</p>
                  <p>Who suffered for our salvation, descended into hell, rose again
the third day from the dead.</p>
                  <p>He ascended into heaven, and sitteth one the right hand of the
Father, God almighty; from whence he shall come to judge the
quick and the dead.</p>
                  <p>At whose coming all men shall rise again with their bodies:
and shall give account for their own works.</p>
                  <p>And they that have done good, shall go into life everlasting:
and they that have done evil, into everlasting fire.</p>
                  <p>This is the Catholike faith: which except a man believe
faithfully, he cannot be saved.</p>

                  <p>GOD spake all these words, saying, I am the Lord thy God,
which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the
house of bondage.</p>
                  <p>Thou shalt have no other gods before me.</p>

<hi>of any thing that is</hi> in Heaven above, or that is in the earth
beneath, or that is in the water under the earth; Thou shalt not
bow down thy self to them, nor serve them; for I the Lord thy
God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquities of the Fathers
upon the children, unto the third and fourth <hi>generation</hi> of them
that hate me; and shewing mercy unto thousands of them that
love me, and keep my commandments.</p>
                  <p>Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain; for
the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.</p>
                  <p>Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy: six days shalt
thou labour, and do all thy work; but the seventh day is the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
of the Lord thy God; <hi>in it</hi> thou shalt not do any work, thou,
nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy man-servant, nor thy maid-servant,
nor thy cattel, nor the stranger that is within thy gates:
for in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea,
and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day; wherefore
the Lord blessed the Seventh day and hallowed it.</p>
                  <p>Honour thy father and thy mother, that thy days may be
long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.</p>
                  <p>Thou shalt not kill.</p>

offenders: and if they continue impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent
or unreformed, to tell the Church,

pray for their recovery): And if they
hear not the Church, but remain impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
and unreformed, after sufficient re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof
and patience, to put away such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
from among us, declaring against
them the threatnings of the Lord, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
them to forbear Communion with
the Church, and requiring the Church to
avoid them, and have no familiarity or
communion with them, as persons unmeet
for the communion of Saints. And those
that credibly profess Repentance, we are to

Absolve Ministerially in the name of Christ,
and comfort with the promises of Grace;
receiving them, and requiring the people to
receive them, as Brethren, into their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion:
but warning them to watch and
sin so no more, lest worse befall them. This
holy Discipline, by the help of God, we
shall exercise faithfully and impartially, but
yet with caution and moderation; neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no necessary consultations with other
Pastors, or concurrence of the Church:
and consenting to be responsible for male-administrations.</p>

and the strengthening our selves for the

therein, and maintaining Unity, Love and

communion and correspondency:
And to that end, when necessity or greater
duty hindreth us not, we shall meet at such
convenient times and places, as shall be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
or agreed on from time to time;
and shall labour to improve these meetings
to our mutual edification, in such consulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,

as our present case shall most require. And
we consent to deal faithfully in advising and
admonishing one another; and for the satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction

of the Brethren (to the fore-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned

the promoting of Truth, and Holiness,
and Unity among our selves, and with
other Churches, as we have a call.</p>
            <p>And also we agree by communicatory
Letters upon all needful occasions, to certifie
our Brethren and other Churches of the
state of our affairs, and of particular mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
that those that justly have communion
in one Church, or are excluded, may have
communion with other Churches, or be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
by them accordingly, when there is
just occasion.</p>
            <p>And if any Brethren or Churches be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
over so far by temptation, as unjustly
to deny us their communion, in this way of
Association, Assemblies, or Correspondency,
we shall not therefore deny them to be our
Brethren, or Churches of Christ, but shall
Love and Own them, and have so much
Communion with them, as their distance
shall leave them capable of, if they joyn
with us in the Profession and Practice of
true Christianity, and of the points that are
necessary to Church-constitution and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,


<pb n="21" facs="tcp:41924:12"/>
and are not proved guilty of
heresie, ungodliness, or such kind of schism
or scandalous sins, for which the Scripture
commandeth us to reject men, and avoid
them. But such as are thus guilty (though
they offer themselves to associate with us)
we shall refuse to hold communion with, till
they credibly profess Repentance, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
a Reformation.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. Because it is a matter of great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment

of the Gospel, and the encrease
and welfare of the Church, that there be a
Provision of able, faithful Ministers, and
that unworthy persons be kept out; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
deceivers and unworthy men are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to intrude, and the people ordinarily
are insufficient of themselves to make such
tryal of mens ability and soundness as is
requisite to the safety of the Church; and
the Church in all ages hath received Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
by the Ordination of other Ministers
of Christ: We do therefore Agree to be
careful and faithful in the discharge of our
duties hereabout, so far as we can discern
them, Resolving that if any vacant Church
desire us to recommend a fit person to be
their Pastor, or to Judge of any recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
to them, we will not recommend


<pb n="22" facs="tcp:41924:13"/>
or approve of any, but such as we judge
most agreeable to the will of Christ; nor
will we prefer less fit and worthy men, for
friendship or any carnal interest or respect.
And if any intollerably unworthy person be
about to intrude, or have intruded, or any
neighbour Church be about to choose, or
have chosen such, if we have opportunity,
we shall faithfully acquaint them with their
sin and danger, and perswade them to a
better course. And if we shall be called to
invest any by solemn Ordination in the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
office of the Ministry, we shall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
it, as near as we are able, according to
the directions of the Word of God; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
none that Christ excludeth: And if
it may be, we shall do it in that Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which the person is to Over-see, that so
we may the better discern their mutual
Consent, inculcate their duties, and engage
them to a faithful performance thereof.</p>
            <p>And whereas it is much controverted of
late, Whether the Power of Ordination be
given to the people, or the Pastors of a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Church, or the Associated neighbour
Pastors, and whether a stated President
among these should not have a negative
voice herein; We are Agreed, that leaving
the people their due Liberty of Consent in


<pb n="23" facs="tcp:41924:13"/>
the reception of their proper Pastors, We
will none of us singly Ordain, without the
assistance of other Pastors: Nor will we
joyn with any Hereticks or others, in unjust
and impious Ordinations, that tend to the
corrupting or dividing of the Churches.</p>
            <p>And to avoid Division upon a tolerable
difference of Opinions, where we may agree
in Practice, we Consent that the Associati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that have no stated Presidents, or that
give not to such a Negative voice, shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
into their Communion those that are
of the contrary opinion; giving them
leave, if they desire it, to profess or record
their opinion in that particular, so they will
afterward walk among them in Love and
Peace. And that the Associations that
choose a stated President, and give him a
Negative voice in Ordination, shall in like
manner, and on like terms, receive into
their Communion, such as dissent in that
particular, and having professed or record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
their dissent, will walk submissively in
Love and Peace. Which liberty also of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing
and recording their different prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
we desire may be allowed them, that
joyn in Synods, as being only for Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion

            <p n="1">1. THE Lord Jesus Christ having pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased
our Salvation by his blood,
and stablished his Testament or Covenant
of Grace, and left us his example of perfect
holiness, ascended to the Father, and is there
the Glorified Lord of all, and Head over all
things to his Church, all power being given
him in Heaven and Earth; that interceding
for us with the Father, he might be the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sury
of our Light and Life; and offering
salvation to the miserable world, might ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and cleanse, and save the Church, which
is his Body; Communicating to them that
grace that is here necessary to them, in their
way and warfare, and perfecting them in
Glory with himself, when their warfare is
accomplished.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Christ Being thus invisible to us, in
Glory with the Father, performeth not
these works below, by himself in person,
immediately and alone; but by his Spirit,
Ministers, and Word. The Holy Ghost
being his Advocate or Agent to these ends;
and his Ministers the Instruments used by his


<pb n="26" facs="tcp:41924:15"/>
Spirit and himself: to indite and bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to his word, and to Preach it to the
world, as that infallible Truth which must
guide them to Salvation.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The first Prophetical and Apostolical
Ministers, being sent by himself, and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by the inspiration, conduct and miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
gifts of the Holy Ghost, did found the
Church, and enlarge it unto many nations of
the world, and left them the holy Scriptures,
which contain the doctrine which they
preached, that it might be certainly and fully
preserved, and propagated till the coming
of Christ. And they setled by the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Christ and his Spirit, an ordinary
ministry to succeed them, not to deliver a
new Law or Gospel, but to preserve and
preach the doctrine which in the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
(and conjunctly at first also from
the mouths of the Apostles) they had
received as once delivered to the Saints,
and to guide the Churches by it to the
end.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Though Christ appointed Ministers
that should have so far a charge or care
of the whole Church, as not to be limited to
any one part, but to extend their labour and
oversight, as far as their capacity and
opportunities would permit: yet did he never


<pb n="27" facs="tcp:41924:15"/>
make any man his Vicar or Vicegerent, as
Head of the universal Church: nor lay
upon any one, whether <hi>Peter, Paul,</hi> or any
other, the charge and oversight of the
whole: nor did ever <hi>Peter</hi> or any one
Apostle exercise such an Office, in governing
all the Catholike Church: especially when
it ceased to be confined to <hi>Jerusalem</hi> and
the adjacent parts, and was dispersed
through the world. Never did the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
receive their Commissions from <hi>Peter:</hi>
or all the Ministers then in the world, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
their work by his Commission, or by
any power received from him, nor were
accountable to him, and judged by him for
what they did. Much less is this universal
Head-ship, committed to the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi>
through all (or any) generations: But
because a certain Primacy of Order was
granted him by Emperours and Councils,
within the limits of the Roman Empire, long
after the Apostles days: therefore doth he
take advantage thence, to pretend a Title to
the universal Head-ship: As if the Roman
and the Christian world had been the same;
or the Emperor and his Clergy had been the
Rulers of all the Christian subjects of all
other Princes or Pastors upon earth: and
his limited Primacy had been an universal


<pb n="28" facs="tcp:41924:16"/>
Soveraignty. This claim of the Pope of
<hi>Rome</hi> to be the Vice-Christ, or universal
Pastor of all the Christian world, is a tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical,
impious, irrational usurpation; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the holy Scripture, and the state of
the Primitive Church, and contrary to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and common sense, which declare his
incapacity of the work; far more then any
Prince is uncapable of being the universal
Monarch of the world; And therefore all
Christians should abhor this proud and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious
usurpation, and fly from the guilt of
that horrible schism, and those corruptions
in doctrine, worship and government,
which it hath introduced.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Christ calleth his ordinary ministers
to that office, by enduing them with his
gifts, and disposing them thereunto, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the hearts of the people to consent, and
by ordination of the senior Pastors; and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

7. This Preaching or publishing the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
is done by voice or by writing: that
by voice, is done by Reading, by publike
Sermons, or interlocutory conference: that
by writing is either by translating the holy
Scriptures into the languages used by the
Nations, or by expounding and applying
them. So that the holy Scriptures in the
<hi>original languages,</hi> are the word of God,
both as to the <hi>terms and sense Grammatical</hi>
and <hi>Doctrinal:</hi> The same Scriptures in a
<hi>Translation</hi> are the word of God as to the
<hi>sense,</hi> both <hi>Grammatical and Doctrinal;</hi> but
not as to the Terms: The holy doctrine of
the Scriptures delivered in the <hi>writings,</hi> and
<hi>Sermons,</hi> and <hi>conferences</hi> of the <hi>Preachers</hi> of
the Gospel, is the word of God, as to the
<hi>Doctrinal sense;</hi> but not as to the <hi>terms</hi> or
<hi>Grammatical sense,</hi> except when they recite
the Scripture words, as in the original or
translated.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Baptism is a holy Sacrament instituted
by Christ, in which a person professing the
Christian faith (or the Infant of such a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor)
is (regularly by a minister of
Christ) baptized in water into the name
of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost,
in signification and solemnization of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Covenant, in which as a Penitent Believer


<pb n="30" facs="tcp:41924:17"/>
(or the seed of such) he giveth up himself
(or is by the Parent given up) to God the
Father, Son and Holy Ghost, from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth
(or from the time of natural capacity)
to Believe in, Love, and serve this blessed
Trinity, against the Flesh, the World, and
Devil, and this especially on the account of
Redemption: and (if he sincerely make this
Covenant) is solemnly entred a member of
Christ and his Church, a justified reconciled
Child of God, and an heir of Heaven: all
which, with the other present benefits of
the Covenant, he is hereby instated (or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vested)
in; they being thus solemnly deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
to him by the Promise thus sealed, and
applyed by an appointed Minister of
Christ.</p>
            <p>Or if some of us doubt whether these
special benefits of the Covenant are deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
thus to all the Infants that are sincerely
dedicated unto God; yet we are all agreed,
that they are assured to them as soon as they
believe: and in the interim of their incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,
they have a general promise that God
will be their God, and his mercy shall be to
them.</p>
            <p n="9">9. It is a notable part of the ministerial
Office to Baptize: and consequently to try
and judge of their Profession who are thus


<pb n="31" facs="tcp:41924:17"/>
solemnly to be admitted into the Church,
and estated by Baptism in these benefits:
Therefore hath Christ given the Keys of his
Kingdom to their trust, both that his holy
Church may be preserved from the unjust
intrusions of uncapable persons: and that
the faithful Covenanters may have the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
consolation, by receiving a sealed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
and pardon, from the hand of a minister
of Christ, commanded by him to seal and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
it in his name.</p>
            <p n="10">10. We are perswaded that it is the Will
of Christ that the Infants of the faithful
shall be dedicated to him in Baptism, and
engaged in his Covenant, and made mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of his visible Church, because we find
that under the promise before Christs Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
it was their duty to devote and
engage their Children to God in the holy
Covenant, and that God did accept them
as visible members of his Church; And we
never find where Christ had discharged
Parents from this duty, or turned all Infants
out of his Church, and reversed this bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of their Church-membership; but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily
we find him offering to have taken
the Jewish Nation to be still his Church, if
they would have taken him for their Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our;
and telling us that it was for Unbelief,


<pb n="32" facs="tcp:41924:18"/>
that they were broken off; and that it is but
some of the branches that were broken off,
and we are graffed in amongst them into
the same Olive-tree, and that all Israel shall
be saved, when the fulness of the Gentiles is
come in; And we find Christ rebuking his
Disciples for hindering little Children from
being offered to him, and that he charged
them to forbid it no more, and that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
and blessed them himself, and tels
us that of such is the Kingdom of God; and
we find it the Commission given to his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,
that they were to Disciple the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
Baptizing them. All which, and
much more (especially having not the least
intimation of his Will against that which
was even then the Duty and Practice of the
Parents, and the Infants benefit) do deter
us from forbidding the dedication of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
unto Christ, and receiving them into
his Church by Baptism.</p>
            <p n="11">11. Baptism being so great a work,
should be deliberately, seriously and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
performed, if it may be, publikely
before the Church, where the person (or
Parent) should make their solemn pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
and be received with the joy and
prayers of the Church; whether Infant or
Adult.</p>
            <p n="12">
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:41924:18"/>
12. The Catholick Church consisteth of
all the Christians in the world: Those that
have the sanctifying Spirit of Christ are the
living members: Those that openly profess
Christianity, and enter into Covenant
with Christ, and are not yet Baptized, are
visible members initially, but the solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zation
and investiture is defective; If it
be where Baptism cannot be had, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
is innocent; If where it may be had,
it is sinful: but yet not such as nullifieth
the persons visible Christianity. And no
errours, offences or differences do exclude
any totally from the Catholick Church,
while all the essentials of Christianity are
kept.</p>
            <p n="13">13. It is the will of Christ that all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
that have opportunity, be members
of some particular Church, as well as of the
universal: that he may have the honour,
and they the great and necessary benefits,
that by the Ministry, Ordinances and
Communion of Saints, is there to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.</p>
            <p n="14">14. A particular Christian Church, is
[A competent number of Christians coha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting,
who by the appointment of Christ,
and their own expressed Consent, are uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
(or associated) under one or more


<pb n="34" facs="tcp:41924:19"/>
Pastors, for the right worshipping of God in
publick, and the Edification of the members,
in Knowledge and Holiness, and the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
of their obedience to Christ, for the
safety, strength and beauty of the society,
and thereby the Glorifying and pleasing of
the Lord.] It is a Political organized
society, that is here defined, and not a meer
Community that is incapable of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and other Ordinances, and the
benefits of them, for want of Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seers.</p>
            <p n="15">15. Those Ministers that are placed in
Parishes, where are many sorts of people,
some Ignorant of the essentials of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
some Apostates, some impious and of
wicked lives, and some that consent not to
be members of their Pastoral charge,
should teach them all that will submit and
learn: For we are called to it by the
Magistrate and obliged by the publike
maintenance which we receive to that
end; and engaged by the general com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of improving our talents, and
the special opportunity that we have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
            <p n="16">16. This teaching of all our Parishioners
that will submit, must be both personally
and publikely, as far as we have ability and


<pb n="35" facs="tcp:41924:19"/>
opportunity. The former must be by Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chizing,
and conference; wherein we must
teach them first the essential points of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,
and labour to help them to the
clearest understanding of the doctrine
of Salvation; and press it on their affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
and help them to discern their sin
and misery, and do all that we can to
procure their conversion or edification,
according to their several states; manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the whole work with those holy affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
that the weight of it doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.</p>
            <p n="17">17. The great necessity of our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
and the advantages of this familiar
way, do tell us that this work of catechizing
and conference is so great a part of our
duty, that we should do it with much dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
prudence and constancy. And the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
precepts of doing all to edification and
in order, oblige us ordinarily to appoint a
stated time and place where every family
may come in order; And if we are able we
should go to them, that cannot or will not
come to us, if they will but hear us.</p>
            <p n="18">18. Those that are Baptized in Infancy,
and there engaged to God in the holy Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
should with all possible care and
diligence, be educated by the Parents, or


<pb n="36" facs="tcp:41924:20"/>
any that have the tuition of them, in the
Nurture and admonition of the Lord, and
taught betimes to know the doctrine of the
Gospel, and to believe in the Lord Jesus
Christ, and to Love God above all, and
their neighbours as themselves, and to hate
iniquity, and live to God, and first to seek
his Kingdom and righteousness; To which
end Parents should Catechize their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and daily be teaching them the word
of God, and acquainting them with his fear
and holy worship. And ministers must
with special care and diligence oversee the
several families of their charge, and excite
the Parents to this necessary duty. And
also should themselves assist them herein,
and Catechize such youth (as well as all
others that are Ignorant) as often as they
can; especially where Parents do neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
it.</p>
            <p n="19">19. As Infants are by baptism admitted
among the Infant-members of the Church,
upon their Parents profession of Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and dedicating them to God; so must
they personally make a profession of their
own faith, and own their baptismal Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
and give up themselves to God the
Father, Son and Holy Ghost, before they are
to be admitted into the number and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion


<pb n="37" facs="tcp:41924:20"/>
of the Adult members of the
Church; Which profession is to be tryed
and approved of by the Pastors of the
Church: And so excellent a duty, to be
carefully, and seriously, and solemnly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
that the transition into the
state and communion of the Adult, may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to be so great and observable a thing,
as may excite all to an answerable care and
diligence, in preparation thereunto, and to
look after that saving faith and holiness,
which they must so solemnly profess. And
Ministers should have a special care, that
they take nothing for a credible profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
that is not so: and corrupt not the
Church by letting in uncapable members,
that must either be cast out again, to the
grievous exasperating them against the
Church and way of God, and so to the
apparent hazzard of their souls: or else
must live ungoverned in their wickedness,
to the great dishonour of God, and the
provocation of his wrath against them and
the Church.</p>
            <p n="20">20. For the publike worshiping of God,
and our own Edification, the Pastors,
where there is opportunity, must congregate
the people in a solemn Assembly in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
place and time. And all that can


<pb n="38" facs="tcp:41924:21"/>
must constantly there attend, preferring
the publike worship of God before the
private: much more before their world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
businesses, that are not of flat necessity
to themselves or others.</p>
            <p n="21">21. In these publike Assemblies it is
lawful for us to admit, even, Infidels
to be present, and such Catechumen's as
are yet unfit to be members of the Church,
and there to teach, reprove and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort
them, and pray for them according
to their state: though we may not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
them to be members of the Church,
nor admit them to our special com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</p>
            <p n="22">22. Because it is the holy Scriptures that
containe that Gospel of which we are Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters;
and because the honour of Gods
holy word is to be preserved, and the people
to be instructed in it, and taught to know it;
it is therefore our duty in the solemn As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies
to read the word of God to the
people, in a known tongue; (as <hi>Moses</hi> and
the Prophets were read every Sabbath day
in the Synagogues of the Jews.) Such
portions being chosen, and order observed,
as the Pastors discern to be most for edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p n="23">23. Our publike preaching of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel


<pb n="39" facs="tcp:41924:21"/>
should be from faith and holy expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
with plainness, and perspicuity, with
reverence and gravity, with convincing
evidence and authority, with fervent zeal,
and perswading importunity, with the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derest
love and melting compassion, with
faithfulness, impartiality and prudence,
suiting both matter and manner to the
necessity of the hearers, and with frequency
and unwearied patience, waiting on God
for the success.</p>
            <p n="24">24. The Pastor is to lead, and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to consent and joyn in heart in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
prayers, and unanimously to pour out
their souls unto the Lord in penitent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of sin, and fervent petition, and
joyful thanksgiving and praise: and this
according to the direction of the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures;
and especially of the Lords prayer:
which is the most perfect, comprehensive
summary, form and pattern of our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</p>
            <p n="25">25. Confession is to be made, both of
our own sin, and the sins of the Church and
Nation, of Magistrates, Ministers and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:
yet so as that we turn it not into a
reproaching and dishonouring of our su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours,
or an abusing of mens persons, by
venting our malice or distempered passions,


<pb n="40" facs="tcp:41924:22"/>
or uncharitable censures against them; we
must confess our original and actual sin:
The great corruption of our hearts and
lives: our sinful thoughts, affections,
words and actions: our privative and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive
sin: out omissions and commissions:
our secret and unknown sins in general, and
our known and open sins by name: our
sins of ignorance, and sins against know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge:
our sins before and since conversion:
our sins against the Lord himself, consisting
in our unholiness, contrary to the first ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
and our unjustice and uncharitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
against our neighbour; and our folly
and injury against our selves: The sins of
our relations, and of our more private life:
our sins against the light and law of nature;
and our sins against the Gospel and grace
of a Redeemer: Against the outward
means of Grace, and against the inward
motions of the Spirit, and of our consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences:
against mercies and judgements:
against the examples of Christ and his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
and the warning-falls of others;
especially those sins by which we have most
dishonoured God and our holy profession;
and have most scandalized, hardened or
tempted others: And all our confessions
should proceed from true contrition and
hatred of the sin.</p>
            <p n="26">
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:41924:22"/>
26. Our petitions must be only for things
agreeable to the revealed will of God: And
principally for the hallowing of his name,
and the coming of his Kingdom, and the
doing of his will, in earth, as it is in heaven:
And therefore we must have compassionate
thoughts of the dark and miserable parts of
the world, where by Heathenism, Infideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Mahometanism, the name of God
is grievously dishonoured, and his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty
denied or rejected, and Satans
Kingdom doth prevail, and where the will
of God is partly unknown, and partly will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
disobeyed: And our eye and heart
must be on the state of the universal
Church, that all this interest of God-in-Christ,
may be <hi>there</hi> preserved and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced.
And in order to these blessed
ends, we must beg such necessaries of our
life, as the supportation of our natures for
the work of God requireth: And the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness
of all our sins through Christ
(which yet we cannot expect to receive, if
we from our hearts forgive not others:)
And a gratious preservation from tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
or the power of them, and from Satan
and sin the greatest evils: That so the holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of our hearts and lives may shew that
we are the loyal subjects of the Kingdom of


<pb n="42" facs="tcp:41924:23"/>
our Lord, and that we acknowledge and
magnifie his Soveraign power, and live as a
people devoted to his glory. And all this we
must beg in an humble sense of our great
unworthiness, misery, necessity and insuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency
to help our selves; and in the name
of Christ, in understanding and faith (and
therefore not in a tongue that we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
not) and with fervency and uncessant
importunity, as directed, excited and
strengthened by the Spirit of Christ.</p>
            <p n="27">27. Our thanksgiving unto God must
not be like the Pharisees, in hypocrisie and
pride, or to make ostentation of things that
we never had, but in humility and holy
joyfulness of mind, we must declare our
thankfulness, for our Creation, Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
Justification and Reconciliation with
God, our Sanctification, and all the parts
thereof, and helps thereunto: For the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
and Ministery; and the plantation,
preservation and propagation of the Church
thereby: for common and special works of
providence, for the good of the Church, our
brethren or our selves: for mercies ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
or extraordinary: spiritual or corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral:
for prevention of evils, or removing
them: for the quality and degree, the suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness
and seasonableness of all our mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,


<pb n="43" facs="tcp:41924:23"/>
with the rest of their aggravations:
especially for those that most promote our
everlasting happiness, and the publike good
and glory of the Lord.</p>
            <p n="28">28. The matter of our holy praises of the
Lord, must be his blessed and infinite Being
and Nature, and all his Attributes: his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
Power, and Wisdom, and Goodness:
his Truth, and Holiness, and Love: his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
Dominion, his Soveraignty, and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly
benignity: his Justice and his Mercy:
even as they are revealed in the works of
the Creation, and in the glass of the holy
Scripture, and in the person of Jesus Christ,
and in the Image of God upon his Saints:
And all these his works also must be praised
in subserviency to his praise. And because
it is a most high and excellent duty to praise
the Lord, we must strive to do it with all
the faith, and reverence, and admiration,
and love, and delight, and joy, and cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
that possibly we can attain: and this
with constancy as our daily work, with our
eye on heaven, where we shall do it in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
to all eternity.</p>
            <p n="29">29. As the holy Scriptures should be
read in a tongue that the people under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
so should the purest exactest transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of them be used that can be had: And


<pb n="44" facs="tcp:41924:24"/>
though it be not of absolute necessity to the
communion or peace of the Churches; yet
it is to be desired and endeavoured, that all
neighbour Churches that are of one lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
do all agree in the use of that one
translation.</p>
            <p n="30">30. Though in cases of necessity the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
may be publikely expounded and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
by the reading of the Expositions and
Sermons of others, yet as it is meet that the
Preachers of the Gospel be able to perform
this work themselves; by the abilities given
them from God, in the use of just and edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
means; so it is meet that by diligent
studying, meditation and prayer, these
abilities be improved; and that from this
holy and spiritual treasure within them, the
Ministers of Christ do draw forth sound
Explication, with pertinent lively Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the truth.</p>
            <p n="31">31. So also in the publike prayers, though
it be lawful (in it self) to read the words of
prayer prescribed us by others; yet as all
Ministers should be able to pray themselves
from the knowledge and feeling of their
own and the peoples wants, so it is meet
that their graces and holy abilities be ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
exercised in such prayer, and that
they be not restrained from speaking to


<pb n="45" facs="tcp:41924:24"/>
God in such sound and meet expressions, as
shall either presently, or by the means of
their preparations, proceed from the sense
of the matter of their prayers, excited and
drawn forth by the assistance of the Spirit
of Christ. But whether any particular Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor
should use a stinted form of words
imposed by others, or invented by himself,
or whether he shall pray without such stint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
forms, or both, by turns, is a point to be
determined according to his own abilities,
and the state of his flock, and other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents:
but it is not to be made a matter
of such necessity in it self, as to lay the unity
or peace of the Churches, or the liberty of
the Pastors and Worshippers of Christ up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it.</p>
            <p n="32">32. The <hi>Publike Praises</hi> of God must
be expressed by the Pastor <hi>in such words</hi>
as are produced by that holy knowledge,
faith, admiration, love and delight, with
which his soul should be possessed that is so
nigh to God; and also by the recitation of
sacred Psalms and Hymns, and by the
cheerfull singing of such by the Church:
wherein the melody must be spiritually, and
not carnally used: for the assisting of our
souls in the exercise of that holy alacrity
and joy that is required in so high a work;


<pb n="46" facs="tcp:41924:25"/>
and not to draw off our minds from the
matter, nor to stop at the pleasing of our
ears. Such Psalms also may be recited or
sung, as contain matter of confession of sin,
petition, thanksgiving, and such narratives
as tend to praise.</p>
            <p n="33">33. The form of words to be said and
sung, must be taken especially out of the
holy Scriptures: to which use we have the
Psalms of <hi>David</hi> and other Hymns: And
also we may use such as have been or shall be
composed by wise and holy men, agreeable
to the doctrine of the Scripture, and fuited
to the Gospel frame of worship, and as far as
may be, even in Scripture phrase. And
though it be not meet to insist upon a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
in lesser things, when it cannot be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
without the violation of concord in
greater things; yet is it much to be desired
and endeavoured that all the Churches of
the same language (especially that are near
and in the same dominions) should agree in
using the same Psalms and Hymns for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and meeter; and that the version so
agreed on, be the best that they can
have.</p>
            <p n="34">34. The Eucharist or Supper of the Lord
is [a holy Sacrament instituted by Christ,
wherein bread and wine being first by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration


<pb n="47" facs="tcp:41924:25"/>
made Sacramentally or represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatively
the Body and Blood of Christ, they
are used by breaking and pouring out, to
represent and commemorate the sacrifice of
Christs Body and Blood upon the Cross,
once offered up to God for sin: and are
given in the name of Christ unto the
Church, to signifie and solemnize the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newal
of his holy Covenant with them, and
sealing it unto them, and the giving of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to them to expiate their sins by his sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,
and sanctifie them further by his
Spirit, and confirm their right to everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
life: and they are received, eaten and
drunk by the Church, to profess that they
willingly receive Christ himself to the ends
aforesaid, (their Justification, Sanctification
and Glorification) and to signifie and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnize
the renewal of their Covenant with
him, and their holy Communion with him,
and with one another.]</p>
            <p n="35">35. The Sacrament of the Lords Supper
containeth in it these three parts. 1. The
Consecration of the Bread and Wine.
2. The Representation and Commemora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Sacrifice of Christ. 3. And the
giving to, and participation by the Church.
The Consecration hath chief respect unto
God the Father: the Representation and


<pb n="48" facs="tcp:41924:26"/>
Commemoration to the Son as sacrificed:
and the Giving and Participation, to the
applying operations of the Holy Ghost.
As it must first be the Body and Blood of
Christ before it be sacrificed, and first offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in sacrifice to God, before it is offered
for nourishment and salvation unto men;
so is it in the order of Sacramental represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
            <p n="36">36. The Consecration is performed by
the Churches offering up the Creatures of
Bread and Wine to God to be accepted to
this holy use: and by Gods acceptance of
them, as dedicated thereunto. The Churches
dedication is expressed by the present acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and Gods acceptance is expressed by his
command and promise, and the ministerial
acception and benediction. The Minister
in this action is the agent of the people in
offering or dedicating these creatures unto
God, and he is Gods Agent or Minister in
receiving and blessing them.</p>
            <p n="37">37. In this dedication of the Bread and
Wine to God to be the consecrated matter
of the commemorative representative sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,
the Church acknowledgeth the
three grand relations of God to his people.
1. We acknowledge him the Creator and
Owner of all the Creatures. 2. We ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge


<pb n="49" facs="tcp:41924:26"/>
him our Righteous Soveraign
Ruler, whose Law we have offended, and
who hath received the attonement, and
whose Laws we do herein obey. And,
3. We acknowledge him our Father, or
bounteous benefactor, by whom we are
sustained, and whose love we have forfeited,
and with whom we desire by Christ to be
reconciled.</p>
            <p n="38">38. This consecration maketh not the
Bread to be no Bread, or the Wine to be no
longer Wine; nor doth it make any addition
to, or change upon the glorified real Body
of Christ; but it maketh the Bread to be
Sacramentally Christs Body; and the Wine
to be Sacramentally his Blood; that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentatively:
as an Actor in a Tragedy is
the person whom he representeth: or as
in Investitures, a sword is the honour of
Knighthood, or a key is the house, or a twig
or turf is the land.</p>
            <p n="39">39. Because Christ was to be invisible to
us, and the heavens must receive him till the
restoration of all things, therefore as he
hath sent his Spirit within to be his Agent
in his members; so hath he appointed his
Ordinances without, and especially this vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
solemn Representation and Comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration
of his sacrifice; that our faith


<pb n="50" facs="tcp:41924:27"/>
might hereby be helped, and our souls might
be raised to such apprehensions of his love
and the mercy of our Redemption, as if we
had even seen him crucified before our eyes,
and this till his glorious return, when
we shall enjoy him visibly in his glory.</p>
            <p n="40">40. As Christ in his Intercession, as our
high Priest in the heavens, procureth and
conveyeth his benefits of salvation upon the
account of his sacrifice once offered on the
Cross; so doth the Church in this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration,
present him unto God the
Father, as the sacrificed Lamb, in whom
they profess themselves to believe, and by
whom alone they expect salvation, and all
the blessings tending thereunto.</p>
            <p n="41">41. In this Commemoration the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
is chiefly the Agent of Christ, in repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
his voluntary offering up himself
unto the Father in sacrifice for sin: And
he is the Agent of the people, in that part
of the Commemoration, in which they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
their Believing in a crucified Christ, and
thankfulness for him, and dependance on
him as their hope.</p>
            <p n="42">42. Jesus Christ having finished the
work of Redemption, which he was to do
on earth, in the days of his flesh, ascended
and is glorified with the Father, and being


<pb n="51" facs="tcp:41924:27"/>
become the perfect head and treasure of the
Church, hath in his Testament or new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
made a free gift of himself and life
to all that will receive him as he is offered;
and he hath appointed his Ministers not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to proclaim this gift unto the world, but
also in his name to deliver it to the Church:
And it is a great encouragement and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
to Believers, that it is a Minister or
Agent of Christ himself, that by his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
and in his name doth say to them
[Take ye, eat ye, this is my Body which is
broken for you.] And [this is my Blood of
the New Testament, which is shed for you,
drink ye all of it]; Christ himself with his
saving benefits, being herewith as truly
offered to their faith, as the signs and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentations
are offered to their hands and
mouths. Though it be still but (consecrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
bread and wine that doth represent, yet
is it the very Body and Blood of Christ that
is represented; and Christ himself as the
Head of the Church, and fountain of our
renewed life, and as our spiritual nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that is truly given us, and received
by us.</p>
            <p n="43">43. It is therefore unmeet for any but a
lawful Minister of Christ, who is authorized
hereunto, to administer this holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:


<pb n="52" facs="tcp:41924:28"/>
both because no other are called to
it in the holy Scripture, nor can shew any
warrant for such an undertaking; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is very injurious to the comfort of
the Church, when they know not that the
person hath any authority to deliver them
so great a mercy from the Lord, nor whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Christ will own his ministration.</p>
            <p n="44">44. The Ministers must partake of this
holy Sacrament with the Church: not as
they are the Agents of Christ for the delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of it, but as they themselves are his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
and members of the Chruch.</p>
            <p n="45">45. Before the receiving of this holy
Sacrament we ought to examine our selves,
that we may come preparedly with repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
for all known sin, and faith in Christ,
and an humble feeling of our own necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and a thankful sense of the love of God
expressed in our redemption by Christ, and
a hungring and thirsting after him and his
righteousness, and with an unfeigned love
unto our brethren, and a high estimation of
the union and communion of the Saints,
and with a resolution to walk in holy obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to God, in patient hope of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Christ, and of the everlasting King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
where we shall be perfectly in him
united: which holy affections are also to


<pb n="53" facs="tcp:41924:28"/>
be exercised in the time of our Communion
in this Sacrament, and afterwards upon the
review of what we have here received and
done.</p>
            <p n="46">46. The Word and Prayer must be joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the Sacrament. The nature and
use of it must be opend, and the people ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
to the exercise of the duties before
mentioned. Sin must be confessed and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented,
and mercy implored, and thankfully
acknowledged, and the goodness of God,
especially manifested in the work of our
Redemption, must with the greatest admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
alacrity and joy that we can attain
to, be magnified and praised, till this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable
love of God in Christ hath drawn
out our hearts in fervent love to him again.
And it will be most suitable to this Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristical
Ordinance, that the Church do sing
some Psalm or Hymn of praise to God, for
the mercies of our Redemption.</p>
            <p n="47">47. Those are to be invited to the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
of the Lord that have these necessary
qualifications, in some degree, and the rest
to be acquainted with the danger of eating
and drinking unworthily. Those only
are to be admitted to the Table of the
Lord that have the use of reason, and
can examine themselves, and are members


<pb n="54" facs="tcp:41924:29"/>
of the Church, and have made a personal
credible profession of faith and holiness,
and are not justly, for heresie or any scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
sin, removed from present communion
with the Church.</p>
            <p n="48">48. The using or not using of forms of
prayer in the administration of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
is to be determined of, as aforesaid
in the other parts of worship, according to
the different abilities of Ministers, and state
of the several congregations, and other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents
that should weigh in such indifferent
things. But as in the Administration of
Baptism, it is ordinarily meetest and most
safe, to use the express form of words
which Christ hath directed us to, and the
Church hath still used, <hi>viz.</hi> [I Baptize thee
in the name of the Father, Son and Holy
Ghost]: so in the Administration of the
Sacrament of the Lords Supper, it is safest
and meetest that we use the words that
Christ by his example hath directed us to
use. As <hi>Matth. 26. 26, 27, 28. Luk. 22.
19, 20. 1 Cor. 11. 24, 25. viz.</hi> [Take ye,
eat ye, this is my Body which is broken for
you, this do in remembrance of me] and
[This is the Blood of Christ, even of the
New Testament (or this is the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the Blood of Christ) which is shed


<pb n="55" facs="tcp:41924:29"/>
for many for the remission of sins; drink
ye all of it in remembrance of him.]</p>
            <p n="49">49. As it is not unmeet for the Church
at other times when they assemble, to make
a solemn profession of the Christian faith
and of holy obedience, to manifest their
constancy therein; and to declare what
doctrine it is that we assemble to profess,
and to preserve it in the minds of all; so is
it more especially meet, that at Baptism and
the Lords Supper, when we are solemnly
to renew our Covenant with the Lord, the
Covenanters do renew this solemn Professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
To which end it is most safe to make
use of the ancient forms of Confession,
called, The Apostles Creed, and the Nicene
Creed; and also to recite the Ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments,
with a profession of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to the terms of the Covenant with God
the Father, Son and Holy Ghost. To which
if we (at lest sometimes) adjoyn some fuller
Explication of the Creed and Decalogue
(such as is our Profession here before set
down) it will not be unprofitable or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meet.
And in such manner it may all be
managed, and such signs or expressions of
consent required, as the Pastors shall judge
meet for the attainment of the desired ends,
with liberty for such variations, as are


<pb n="56" facs="tcp:41924:30"/>
necessary to prevent a dead formality.</p>
            <p n="50">50. At the dismission of the Assembly,
it is meet that the Pastor do solemnly bless
them in the name of Christ, to which he is
authorized as an act of his Ministerial
Office.</p>
            <p n="51">51. Deacons are Church-Officers insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
by the Holy Ghost to be serviceable
to the Pastors and the Church, by the distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution
of the Creatures dedicated to the
Church-Communion, and taking care for
the supplying of the necessities of the
poor, out of the contributions or stock of
the Church.</p>
            <p n="52">52. The first day of the week is appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
or separated by the Holy Ghost for the
holy Assemblies and publike worship of the
Church and other holy exercises; and is
herein to be improved to the honour of
God, and the edification of our selves and
others: and all other imployments are
therein to be avoided that any way hinder
the holy duties of the day; except such as
become a greater duty, upon the account of
Piety, Justice or Mercy. That some stated


<pb n="57" facs="tcp:41924:30"/>
time be separated to the publike service of
God and the benefit of our souls, is a thing
that the law of Nature doth command;
that this stated time should be at least one
day in seven, the reason and equity (at
least) of the fourth Commandment doth
acquaint us: that this day should be every
first day of the week, the Holy Ghost in the
New Testament hath revealed to us; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting
us with Christs rising on that
day (which laid the foundation of the
change) and of the Assembling of his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
on that day, and his owning their
Assembly by his appearing to them, and
teaching them, and blessing them, and
giving them their commission and the Holy
Ghost, <hi>Joh.</hi> 20. 19, to 24. The same they
did the next first day, where he again ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
and owned their Assembly, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
himself unto them, <hi>Joh.</hi> 20. 26, 27.
And that this was the practice of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
and the Primitive Christian Churches
directed by them, appeareth <hi>Act. 20. 7, 8.
1 Cor.</hi> 16. 1, 2. so that it was called the
Lords Day, as the last day before was called
the Sabbath, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 10. And to put us out
of all doubt of the matter of fact, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
of the meaning of these texts of
Scripture; the certain Tradition and most


<pb n="58" facs="tcp:41924:31"/>
Concordant history of the Church assureth
us, that ever since the days of the Apostles,
the universal Church in all parts of the
world, hath constantly observed the Lords
Day in Commemoration of the Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of Christ: which it is not possible that
they could have done, without contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
and rebukes from the Apostles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
or some of the Churches which they
planted, if it had not been a certain truth.
Those therefore that will be against the
holy observation of the Lords Day, must
either impudently deny the Testimony of
all Church History and Tradition, which
with one consent assure us that it was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
universally in the Christian
Churches from the Apostles daies, as a
thing by them established and practised;
or else they must imagine that all the
dispersed Churches through the world
conspired in the teaching and practising
of such an error without any known re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke,
wherein it had been most easie for any
to have convicted them to be slanderers of
the Apostles, or the Ages that were before
them. Having therefore so much in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
in the fourth Commandment, in the
New Testament, and the Doctrine and
Practice of the universal Church, for our


<pb n="59" facs="tcp:41924:31"/>
holy observation of this day; it ill beseems
any Christian to forsake all or any of these,
and think now in the end of the world to
find out the certain practice of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
better then all the Churches which
they planted.</p>
            <p n="53">53. Seeing the Lords Day is purposely
set apart for the celebrating of the memori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
of the Resurrection of Christ, and so of
the work of our Redemption (as the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
was for the Commemorating of the
work of Creation), the work of the day
must be very much Eucharistical, and the
Church should be taken up in the thankful
admiration of the mysterie and mercy of
our Redemption, and in the affectionate
praises of the Lord our Redeemer, and an
aspiring after the everlasting Rest, which he
hath purchased, and promised, and prepared
for us with himself.</p>
            <p n="54">54. Ministers must not only perform the
publike worship of God upon this day, but
also exhort the people to improve the
rest of it in private, by prayer, and medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and holy conference, and calling to
mind the Word which they have heard;
especially the Parents and Masters of fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
who must instruct their children and
servants, and watch over them, and restrain


<pb n="60" facs="tcp:41924:32"/>
them from the violation of the day, and
call them to an account of the doctrine
they have heard, and the duties to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</p>
            <p n="55">55. It is lawful, and a duty on other daies
also, according to our necessities and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities,
to Redeem some time for the
publike worship of God. And whenever
the Pastors shall call the Church together,
to hear the Word, or perform holy worship,
it is the peoples duty obediently and gladly
to attend, if greater duties do not prohibit
them.</p>
            <p n="56">56. When great afflictions lie upon the
Church, or any useful members of it; or
when any great sins have been committed
among them, it is meet that in publike by
fasting and prayer we humble our selves
before the Lord, for the averting of his
displeasure. And on such occasions it is
the Pastors duty to confess his own and the
peoples sins, with penitence and tenderness
of heart, and by his doctrine and exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to endeavour effectually to bring the
people to the sight and sense of their sin, and
the deserts of it, and to a firm resolution
of better obedience for the time to
come; being importunate with God in
Prayer for pardon and renewed Grace.</p>
            <p n="57">
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:41924:32"/>
57. Upon the receipt of any notable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
mercies, the Church having
opportunity, should Assemble for publike
Thanksgiving unto God: wherein the
Pastors should stir them up to the livelyest
sense of the greatness of their mercies, and
lead them in a joyful celebration of the
praises of their bountiful benefactor. And it
is lawful on these daies to express our joy
in feasting and outward signs of mirth;
provided that they be moderately and
spiritually used, and not to gratifie our sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual
desires; and that we relieve the poor
in their necessities (which also on daies of
Humiliation and other seasons we must not
forget.)</p>
            <p n="58">58. It is not unlawful or unmeet to keep
an anniversary commemoration of some
great and notable mercies to the Church,
the memory whereof should be transmitted
to posterity.</p>
            <p n="59">59. In all the modes and circumstances of
worship which God himself hath left unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined,
all Christians must take heed of
making unnecessary things to be necessary,
and laying the unity and peace of the
Church on things indifferent, and laying
snares for the consciences of others; but
must leave much to the prudence of the


<pb n="62" facs="tcp:41924:33"/>
particular Pastors that are upon the place,
to whom it belongs to fit such circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantials
to their peoples state; and the
Churches in such things wherein they may
safely differ, must be left to their liberty:
Long and sad experience having taught us,
that the violent imposing of unnecessary
things, is the engine of the Devil to tear the
Church.</p>
            <p n="60">60. The marriage of Christians being a
work of great concernment to themselves,
and meet to be publikely performed, and
accordingly to be sanctified by the Word
and Prayer; it is convenient that it be
solemnized by the Minister, or at least that
he counsell and exhort them, and pray for a
blessing on them: being first sufficiently
satisfied of their capacity and necessary pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations.
Herein he is to acquaint them
with the Institution, Nature and Ends of
their Relations; and the duties severally
and joyntly by them to be performed; and
the difficulties and temptations to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
and provided for. Especially they
are to be directed to live together in holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
as the heirs of life, and to be very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and diligent in the holy education of
their children, and governing their families
for the Lord; and to use the world as not


<pb n="63" facs="tcp:41924:33"/>
abusing it, remembring their approaching
separation by death. And he is to see
that they solemnly enter into the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonial
Covenant, engaging themselves
to conjugal fidelity to each other, until they
are separated by death.</p>
            <p n="61">61. The Pastors of the Churches must
not only Teach the people, and guide
them in the publike worship: but also must
faithfully Oversee them in private, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
to know and watch over each mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of their flock, preserving them from he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies,
errours, and divisions: defending the
Truth, confuting gainsayers and seducers;
instructing the Ignorant, exciting the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent;
encouraging the despondent; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting
the afflicted, confirming the weak,
rebuking and admonishing the disorderly
and scandalous, and directing all accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their needs, in the matters of their
Salvation. And the people in such needs
should have ordinary recourse to them, as
the Officers of Christ, for guidance and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
of their doubts, and for assistance
in making their Salvation sure, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing,
maintaining or restoring the peace


<pb n="64" facs="tcp:41924:34"/>
of their consciences, and spiritual consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p n="62">62. Those persons that are known to
commit any gross and scandalous sin,
should first by private reproof and admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
(unless where the notoriousness and
heinousness of the crime doth presently call
for publike reproof) be called to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance:
And if they hear not the Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
or will not Reform, the Church must
be told of it: and therein it is most conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient,
that the Pastors be first acquainted
with the case (to avoid contention and
confusion,) before it be brought into the
publike assembly: And to that end it is
convenient that there be stated meetings
where the Pastors and some chosen members
of the Church, (not as Officers, but the
Deputies or Trustees of the rest) should
in their several capacities take cognizance
of such offences; that so a unity and full
correspondence may be held between the
Pastors and the flock, and all things may be
done advisedly, orderly, and concordant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
but where this cannot well be done, the
Pastor or Pastors must do their work with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it.</p>
            <p n="63">63. Those persons that by more private
means will not be brought to necessary


<pb n="65" facs="tcp:41924:34"/>
Repentance and Reformation, must by the
Pastor be publikely reproved and admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
before the Church, and there called
to Repentance by the opening of their sin,
and the judgements of the Lord, and plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with them those Gospel mercies and
motives that should melt them into contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And if the success do not appear, it
is ordinarily meet that the Church should
joyn in prayer for the offender, that God
would give him repentance unto life.</p>
            <p n="64">64. If after sufficient waiting in the use
of these means, the offendor still remain
impenitent, it is the duty of the Church to
reject him out of their communion. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Pastors must compassionately declare
his offence and his Impenitency, and the
Judgements that God hath threatned to
such, and the Laws of Christ commanding
the Church to put such from among them,
and avoid them, and have no company with
them, that they may be ashamed, or to take
them as Heathen men or Publicans: and
must accordingly declare the person offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to be unmeet for Christian Communion,
and charge the people to avoid him, and
have no fellowship with him, and himself
to forbear the Communion of Christians,
binding him over to answer it at the bar of


<pb n="66" facs="tcp:41924:35"/>
Christ. Which sentence must be accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
executed by the Pastors, in refusing
him the Ordinances proper to the Church,
and by the people in avoiding familiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and communion with him, till he be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored
upon his Repentance.</p>
            <p n="65">65. It must be a <hi>credible Profession</hi> of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
only that must be accepted by the
Church either for the preventing of such
a rejection, or for restoring the rejected.
And usually when the case is heinous and
notorious, or the Church hath had the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
cognizance of it, they must also have
publike notice of the penitence of the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor;
who should with remorse of conscience
and true contrition confess his sin before the
Congregation, and heartily lament it, and
crave the prayers of the Church to God for
pardon and reconciliation through Christ,
and also crave an Absolution by the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
and a restoration into the communion
of the Church: But because it much depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
on circumstances of the case whether
the Confession should be publike or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate,
or in what manner made, it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to be much left to the Prudence of the
Pastors, whom the people in such cases are
commanded to obey.</p>
            <p n="66">66. When a credible Profession of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance


<pb n="67" facs="tcp:41924:35"/>
is made (whether voluntarily by
the Converted, or upon the Churches ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition
by the scandalous, or after ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication)
it is the duty of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors
to declare such Penitents in the name
of Christ to be pardoned and absolved, and
Ministerially to give them this Mercy from
the Lord, in case their Repentance be sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
as they profess: And if the person
were excommunicate, it is the duty of the
Pastor to declare him again meet for the
Communion of the Church, and require the
Church to receive him with joy as a return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
sinner, and not to reproach him with
his falls, but to forgive him; as Christ for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveth
him; all which they are accordingly
to perform; and the Penitent with Joy to
receive his absolution, and to return to the
Communion of the Church, and to a
more holy careful obedient life.</p>
            <p n="67">67. When any by frequent Covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breaking,
have forfeited the Credit of their
words, the Church must have testimony of
the <hi>actual Reformation</hi> of such persons, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they can receive their professions and
promises as credible any more. Though
yet there is so great difference here in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
and offences, that the particular cases
must be much left to the prudence of the


<pb n="68" facs="tcp:41924:36"/>
Pastors that are present, and know the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
and the whole case.</p>
            <p n="68">68. So great is the necessity of the sick,
and so seasonable and advantagious the
opportunity, that Ministers should not neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently
omit them, but in Love and tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
instruct them, according to their seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
conditions: endeavouring the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the ungodly, and the strengthening
of the weak, and comforting such as need
Consolation; directing them how to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
their affliction; and helping them
to be truly sensible of the evil of sin, the
miscarriages and negligences of their lives;
the vanity of the world; the necessity and
sufficiency of Christ, and the certainty and
excellency of the everlasting Glory: Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading
them to a pious, just and charitable
disposal of their worldly estate; and to
forgive such as have wronged them, and to
be reconciled to those with whom they have
been at variance; and believingly to hope
for that life with Christ, which he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
to all that are sanctified by his Spirit,
and comfortably to commit their souls to
their Redeemer, and quietly rest in the Will,
and Love, and Promises of God; Resolving
if God should recover them to health, to
Redeem their time, and live as a people de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted


<pb n="69" facs="tcp:41924:36"/>
to his Glory. It is meet also that
the Pastors pray for the sick, both privately
and publikely when it is desired and thought
fit.</p>
            <p n="69">69. The Burial of Christians should be
decent and honourable, and though it be
a thing indifferent in it self, whether Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations,
Funeral Sermons or Prayers be
then used, yet because the season is very
advantagious for mens reception of holy
instructions, it is convenient (at least when
desired) that the Minister do take that
season as often as he can, to mind people
of their mortality, and the necessity of a
speedy preparation for their change: so
prudently managing all his Exhortations
and Prayers, that the due end may be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
and the abuse prevented as far as
may be.</p>
            <p n="70">70. The lives of Christs Ministers should
be conformable to their holy doctrine: and
so exemplary in Innocency, Love, Humility,
Meekness, Patience, Contempt of the world,
crucifying the desires of the flesh, and in
a zealous heavenly conversation, and in all
works of Piety, Justice and charity, within
their power, that the mouths of the enemies
may be stopped, and the people may learn,
and be convinced and directed, even by


<pb n="70" facs="tcp:41924:37"/>
their holy examples, and our selves may be
saved, and the Christian Church and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
may be honoured, to the glory of the
Holy Ghost and of our Redeemer, and our
heavenly Father.</p>
            <p n="71">71. As we have all one God, one Christ,
one Spirit, one Faith, and Hope, and Love,
one Covenant, and one Catholike Church, so
should the Communion of Saints extend as
far as their capacity and opportunities will
allow. And as particular persons must
Associate for personal Communion in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
worship, so particular Churches should
associate for such Brotherly correspondency
and communion, as they are capable of, and
their needs require; That by communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Truths and Mercies which they
have received, and advising together, and
by a brotherly collation of their apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
and improvement of their several
gifts, the unity of the Churches may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
and discords and uncharitableness
may be avoided, and the beauty and
strength of the Churches maintained. And
therefore the Pastors of the neighbour
Churches (not excluding others that are fit)
should meet as frequently, and at such times


<pb n="71" facs="tcp:41924:37"/>
and places, as the ends and works of the
Association do require.</p>
            <p n="72">72. Into these Associations such Pastors
and Churches should be received that make
a credible Profession of Faith and Holiness,
and no other: And they that are Hereticks,
or of scandalous ungodly lives, must after
a first and second admonition, if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
impenitent, be rejected and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owned
by the Faithful Pastors and Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</p>
            <p n="73">73. Where the fixing of a stated Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
in each of these Associations is requisite
for the peace and edification of the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
it may well be yielded to: but how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
a special care must be had to prevent
contentions and divisions: and therefore
perverse disputings must be suppressed; and
proud, self-conceited, domineering persons,
and such as are of fiery, turbulent, conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
spirits, and also subtile hereticks and
dividers, must be watched against as the
plague of the Churches, and all possible
charity, humility, meekness, self-denyal,
and zeal for holy concord, must be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised.</p>
            <p n="74">74. Those that through distance or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments
cannot, or through mistakes or
peevishness will not joyn in such stated bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly


<pb n="72" facs="tcp:41924:38"/>
Associations and Assemblies, are yet
to be allowed the due estimation and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Brethren, and so much Communion as
at a distance they are capable of, if they do
but agree with us in a sound profession of
the faith, and a holy conversation, and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterial
fidelity in the main: but yet we must
disown the sin of their dividing, or neglect,
and as we have opportunity testifie against
it.</p>
            <p n="75">75. These Churches that cannot hold lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Communion with one another through
differences that destroy not the Essentials
of Christianity, should yet maintain a dear
and tender Christian Love to one another,
and profess their owning each other as
Christians, and Churches of Jesus Christ,
and should agree together upon certain
just and equal Rules for the management
of their unavoidable differences, so as may
least prejudice charity and common good,
and least harden the ungodly, or grieve the
weak, or dishonour God, or hinder the
success of Common, great and necessary
Truths upon the souls of men; contriving
and amicably promoting the Cause of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,
and every part of it, in which they
are agreed; and should open their disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to the people as little as they can.</p>
            <p n="76">
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:41924:38"/>
76. In cases of tolerable difference, as
Ministers and People must maintain a special
holy Love, and Communion as far as their
differences will admit; so must they desire
the well-fare and the Peace of one another,
and not stir up hatred or persecution, against
each other, by odious nick-names, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asperating
the Magistrate or people against
dissenters; but should consent to the
Liberty of each other, and help to take off
unjust hatred, and to hinder all unmerciful
violence or rigor against one another; And
all of us should watch against and abhor that
proud, self-conceited, domineering disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that would make us censorious, malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
or cruel against the weakest servants of
the Lord.</p>
            <p n="77">77. Yet must we not under pretence of
Charity, consent to any such noxious Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
as plainly tendeth to the wrong of
the Church, and the poysoning of the souls
of others; nor yet must we consent to the
errours of the best. Though we are not
the judges of the secrets of mens hearts, nor
may not deal uncharitably with any, yet
must not heretical self-conceited persons
be tolerated in the obstinate dispersing of
their errours, to the destruction or danger
of mens souls, nor to reproach and speak


<pb n="74" facs="tcp:41924:39"/>
against the weighty necessary truths of
God: Nor should any be tolerated to
kindle the flames of uncharitableness and
contentions in the Churches, by railing, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachful
language against the tolerable dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senters:
But a healing, merciful, and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
and not a destructive Toleration
should be promoted.</p>
            <p n="78">78. The Pastors of the Churches of Christ
have the power of the Keys of the Kingdom
of Heaven, but not of the Temporal sword
on earth: And though we determine not
whether in cases of Necessity, it be lawful
for Pastors to be also Magistrates; yet it is
certain that without Necessity it should not
be allowed (their work requiring all their
time and strength) and that as Pastors it
belongeth not to them; But as the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
is the appointed officer of God, to
Govern even Churches, Pastors, and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
in the way of outward force, and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors
are his Officers to govern them by Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Conduct; so must we be so far from
desiring to usurp a secular power, that we
should still advise the Magistrate to keep
the sword in his own hand, and to take heed
of putting compulsive power in the hands of
Pastors, or enabling them to execute their
passionate displeasure against their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren:


<pb n="75" facs="tcp:41924:39"/>
And as the Magistrate must not usurp
the Pastors office, but only see that we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
it our selves, and punish us if we do not;
so must not the Pastors usurp the Magistrates
office, but humbly and modestly teach and
advise him from the word of God, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
him, and threaten him, and in cases of
extremity denounce the Wrath of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him, and bind him over to the Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
of Heaven, to answer for his obstinate
impenitent contempt; and then leave all
the matter to that bar, and patiently suffer
if we be persecuted by him; Not doing any
thing in the management of any of our
work, without a due respect and reverence
to his Authority, and a care of the common
good that dependeth on his honour, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring
what is meet for him to hear, and
for us as Messengers of Christ to speak.</p>
            <p n="79">79. Those Churches of several Nations
that through distance and diversity of secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Governours, are uncapable of perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
or local Communion with others, should
yet consent as neer as may be in their holy
professions, and practises; not tying each
other to any of their unnecessary modes
or forms, nor uncharitably censuring any
tolerable dissenters, but owning those
Churches that agree with them in the great


<pb n="76" facs="tcp:41924:40"/>
and necessary things, &amp; holding such corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondence
with them by Messengers, as shall
be needful to the promoting of their Unity,
Love and Peace, and of the Gospel and
common cause of Christ, and the defence of
each other against the common enemies of
those, as emergent occasions shall require
and direct them.</p>
            <p n="80">80. To the aforesaid uses, the Councils
or Synods of Pastors are lawful and conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
in cases that require them, where the
Pastors of several Churches and Nations
may diliberate and determine in order to
their Unity, of Doctrines and Practices to
be Agrreed in, and may strengthen the
hands of one another. But yet, the Canons
of such Councils are rather Agreements,
then proper Laws, to their several members
or absent Brethren; and bind in order to
Unity and Concord by vertue of those Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Commands that require us to do the
work of God in such Unity and Concord,
and not by vertue of any proper superior
Regimental power, which that Council hath
over the particular Bishops of the Churches
of Christ. And as for General Councils, as
we should to the forementioned ends regard
and honour them above all other, if really
such were lawfully assembled; so in this


<pb n="77" facs="tcp:41924:40"/>
enlarged and dispersed state of the Militant
Church, we may easily see, that full and
proper Universal Councils, are neither the
Stated Governors of the Universal Church,
nor necessary to its well-being, no nor Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to be attempted, as a Course that would
certainly destroy or grievously wrong the
Churches, by the death and long absence of
the Pastors, through so many hundred and
thousand miles travail, and so long attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
which the state and work of proper
Universal Councils will require: Yea the
said distance, with the age and weakness of
the Pastors, and the different languages,
and the poverty of many disabling them
from such tedious voyages and journies,
and the dissent of the Princes. (many of
them Heathens, Infidels, Mahometans) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
whose Government they live, or
through whose dominions they must pass,
these with many the like Impediments do
make a true Universal Council (like an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Parliament or Senate) to be so far.
from necessary, or desirable, as to be Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
Impossible, or next to Impossible, as to
the very Being of it.</p>
            <p>The way that God hath appointed for
Church-Government and deciding contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies,
is, 1. That Princes and Magistrates


<pb n="78" facs="tcp:41924:41"/>
govern by the sword or force, and judge
who are fit to be Punished by the sword
(And though most Princes on the earth by
Infidelity have made themselves uncapable
of this part of the work of their Office, yet
cannot that disoblige them from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
of God, or free them from his pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments
for not performing them, nor
make the Office of Magistrates another
thing, nor disable Christian Princes and
Magistrates, or disoblige them who have
not made themselves uncapable.) 2. That
these Princes and Governors of several Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
do hold a Loving Christian Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondency,
for the management of their
affairs, and Government of the Churches
under them, so as may be most to the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of the Cause of Christ, and the union,
strength and defence of Christians; (The
General Rules, and Ends of their Trust and
Power, do oblige them to hold such Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies
by their Messengers as are needful for
their Agreement and the Unity and Safety
of the Churches under them, as well as they
oblige Pastors to such necessary correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencies.)
3. That the Pastors of particular
Churches be the Governors of those Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
by the word and holy Discipline (not
having the power of the sword or violence)


<pb n="79" facs="tcp:41924:41"/>
and that they Judge who is fit or unfit for
Communion with that Church which each
or any of them over-see, and who is to be
thence Excommunicated, or there Absolved.
4. That these Bishops, Pastors, or Elders of
particular Churches, should hold Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
among themselves with all their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
of other Churches, as far as their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
capacity will allow, and the need or
benefit of the Churches require it: and that
they handle in common the causes that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to all in common, and settle and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Agreements for the Unity and Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of the Churches: And they are Judges
(as Associate) who is to be received into
their Associate Communion; and who to be
excluded from it; and what Pastors or
Churches they should hold such Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with as they are capable of; and which
they should admonish, or renounce. 5. The
Christian people have allowed them a Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Discretion, by which they must
prove all things, and hold fast that which
is good: and must discern and obey the
Lawfull commands and directions of their
Magistrates and Pastors. 6. And as Men
have thus their several shares alloted them
in Government, Judgement, and decisions,
limitedly, and not Absolutely judging, even


<pb n="80" facs="tcp:41924:42"/>
to the Execution which belongs to their seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Judicatures: So the Finall Absolute
Judgement, and Decision of all Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies
and Causes, is reserved to the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Tribunal of the Lord, to which we
may make our last Appeal, where all the
world shall be judged in Righteousness, and
all the Judgements of men be themselves
Judged, and Truth and Error, Good and
Evil, Right and Wrong will be more perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
manifested unto all; and it shall be irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versibly
determined by Jesus Christ, who shall
go into Life Everlasting, and who to everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
punishment.</p>
