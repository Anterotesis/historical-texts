            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The CASE of the Election for the City of Briſtol.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>UPon the</hi> Petition <hi>of Mr.</hi> Robert Henly <hi>Merchant, Complaining of divers Irregularities and Illegal Practices in the Election, and that Sir</hi> Robert Cann <hi>Baronet is returned, as Choſen for that City, together with Sir</hi> John Knight, <hi>to ſerve in this preſent Parliament, whereas in truth Sir</hi> John Knight, <hi>and the Petitioner Mr.</hi> Henly, <hi>were duly Choſen by the Majority of Rightful Electors, and ought ſo to have been return'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He City of <hi>Briſtol</hi> is a Large and Populous City, and a County of it ſelf, and <unclear>hath</unclear> at leſt 2000 Free Burgeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes Inhabitants, who are Govern'd by a <hi>Major,</hi> 12 <hi>Aldermen,</hi> 2 <hi>Sheriffs,</hi> and a <hi>Common-Council</hi> of 40, Choſen according to a Charter, whereby it is Incorporated and made a City, which antiently was only a Village, or Free Borough.</p>
            <p>When the <hi>Proclamation</hi> was Publiſhed, Declaring His Majeſties Reſolution to call this preſent Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Sir <hi>John Knight</hi> (who had formerly ſerved for the ſame City) offered to ſerve again if they would freely Chooſe him, and at the Requeſt of many of the Free Burgeſſes and Freemen, Mr. <hi>Henly</hi> likewiſe offer'd them to ſerve in this preſent Parliament if they ſhould Elect him, but Sir <hi>John Lloyd</hi> the then <hi>Major,</hi> and ſome of the <hi>Aldermen</hi> and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Council</hi> Combining with the then <hi>Sheriffs</hi> to prevent the Free Choice of the Citizens, did ſet up Sir <hi>R C.</hi> Baronet, and Sir <hi>Robert Y.</hi> Baronet, two of the <hi>Aldermen</hi> of the City, and to get them to be Choſen, and to prevent the Election of Sir <hi>John Knight</hi> and Mr. <hi>Henly,</hi> did contrive, reſolve upon, and put in practice, divers Illegal and Irregular things; as Before the <hi>Election;</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They gave out, That none but Freemen could be choſen, and at the ſame time denyed Mr. <hi>Henly</hi> his Freedom, though he Legally demanded to be made Free, and themſelves Confeſt he had a Right to be ſo, as having Married a Freemans Daughter, but ſaid, that He ſhould not have his Freedom, becauſe he ſhould not be Choſen a Parliament Man.</p>
            <p>They deny'd ſeveral Perſons their Freedom, who had a Right to it, and Legally demanded it, becauſe they knew, (as they ſaid) they would Vote for Sir <hi>John Knight,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Henly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They declared, That ſuch as Voted for Mr. <hi>Henly,</hi> ſhould be taken notice of, as Enemies to the Freedom of the City.</p>
            <p>The Morning before the Election they did cauſe Papers to be Poſted up at ſeveral parts of the Town, purpoſing, That none but a Freeman could be Elected, and at the Bottom of ſome of thoſe Papers, was Written, <hi>No Henly; No Henly:</hi> and when ſome of the Electors pulled down thoſe Papers, they were, for ſo doing, Bound over to the <hi>Seſſions,</hi> and forced to give Security for their Good Behavior in the mean time.</p>
            <p>At the <hi>Election;</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They deny'd to take the Pole for Mr. <hi>Henly,</hi> and took it only for the other Three; but after ſome time, having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd of the Matter, they told him, That the Pole ſhould be taken for him if he would provide a Clerk to take it; but when he had offered one or two to take the Pole for him, they abuſed and beat them, and ſaid, None but their own Clerks ſhould take the Pole; who thereupon began to take it for Mr. <hi>Henly,</hi> but would not permit Mr <hi>Henly,</hi> or any body for him to ſuperviſe it.</p>
            <p>The Pole was begun in the <hi>Guildhall,</hi> which, ſoon after they begun to take the Pole for Mr. <hi>Henly,</hi> was almoſt full of ſuch as offer'd to Vote for Sir <hi>John Knight,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Henly,</hi> but ſo ſoon as this was perceived, they withdrew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into an Inner Room, and bolted themſelves in, and Letting in at a Back-door, ſuch as (by a <hi>VVord</hi> given) were known to Vote for the other Competitors continued on the Pole there, but when any that knew not the <hi>VVord</hi> endeavored to get in, they were kept out, and beaten back; the other, who Voted for the other Competitors, and knew the <hi>VVord,</hi> were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted at the ſame time; and as ſoon and as often as any number got in, who deſired to be Polled for Sir <hi>John Knight,</hi> and Mr <hi>Henly,</hi> the Pole was Adjourned; whereby, the Pole was continued 9 days, which might eaſily have been ended in 2.</p>
            <p>There being many Electors in the City, who declared themſelves for Sir <hi>John Knight,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Henly,</hi> that they knew would not take any Oath, not Legally Impoſed upon them, they refuſed any to give their Voices, that would not Swear themſelves Free, though they ſhewed a Copy of their Freedom, under the Hand of the Chamberlain, and Seal of his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and admitted all, that would Swear themſelves Free, to be Polled; whereby, many that were neither Freemen, nor Freeholders were Polled for Sir <hi>Robert Cann,</hi> and Sir <hi>Robert Yeomans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the laſt day of the Poll they returned, and ſat in the <hi>Guildhall,</hi> and at the other end of the Hall, the Mayor, and ſome Aldermen ſat as a Court, and called for the Goaler, and publickly commanded their Officers to bring before them thoſe that Poled for Sir <hi>John Knight,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Henly,</hi> whom being brought before them, were Committed to Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, upon pretence of Offences formerly committed againſt certain <hi>Penal Statutes;</hi> Whereupon, Great Multitudes that came to Poll for Sir <hi>John Knight,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Henly,</hi> were ſo Terrified, that they went away, and durſt not give their Vote; and at the ſame time, in the ſame Circumſtances with thoſe Impriſoned, were ſuffered to Vote for Sir <hi>Robert Cann,</hi> and Sir <hi>Robert Yeomans,</hi> and to go away freely and unmoleſted. By which Contrivance alone, they Confeſſed, That themſelves believed, they deprived Sir <hi>John Knight,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Henly</hi> of 400 Votes.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding all which <hi>Irregularities,</hi> and <hi>Illegal Practices,</hi> Sir <hi>John Knight,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Henly</hi> had the Majority of Rightful Voices, and ought therefore to have been <hi>Return'd,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Henly</hi> hopes to make appear at the Hearing of the Cauſe.</p>
            <p>After the <hi>Election;</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Being Conſcious of the <hi>Illegality</hi> of their Proceedings, in Committing Perſons to Priſon at the POLE, they Diſcharged them without any Requeſt on their behalf, and without Bail or Proſecution, though the <hi>Statute,</hi> upon which the Commitment was grounded, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires Three Months Impriſonment, without Bail or Mainprize.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Robert Cann,</hi> &amp;c. Made it their Buſineſs to Proſecute all the Diſſenters that Voted for Mr. <hi>Henly,</hi> and Sir <hi>John Knight;</hi> while thoſe that Voted for Sir <hi>Robert Cann,</hi> and Sir <hi>Robert Yeomans</hi> were equally Informed againſt, but not proſecuted.</p>
            <p>About Three days after the <hi>Election,</hi> the <hi>Mayor</hi> and <hi>Sheriffs</hi> apprehending the danger they had run themſelves into by theſe <hi>Illegal Proceedings,</hi> called a <hi>Common Council,</hi> and there procured a Vote to Indemnifie the Mayor for what he had done in the <hi>Election</hi> at the City Charges, and the ſame was Moved in behalfe of the <hi>Sheriffs,</hi> but Sir <hi>John Knight</hi> Proteſting againſt it, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing, it could not be obtained. <add>so many others w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> him y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> herd remayned not<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
