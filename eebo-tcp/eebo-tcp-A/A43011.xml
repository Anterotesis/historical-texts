         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

that it was his Majesty's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
I should write my Lord's
Case, the humble obedience I
owed to so great and high Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
hath obliged me to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
the said Case in all its
circumstances; not doubting
but that it may prove as use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb facs="tcp:62336:3"/>
in its kind, especially if it
shall meet with an Answer, as
any Physical Consultation that
ever was yet printed. For,
first, it contains the best <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial
Method,</hi> and Practice of
the chiefest, Experienc'd, Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedest
Physicians. 2. Their

<pb facs="tcp:62336:3"/>
Method and Remedies for cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
a Fever, Acute Pains,
Vomitings, Gripes, and many

this, a clear Demonstration,
that his Lordship was troubled
with no other Disease, than
what was occasioned by the
puncture of a Nerve, or procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by Art.</p>
            <p>But what I chiefly pretend
unto in this Tract, is to inform
you how to cure the most dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
of Wounds by the <hi>first
Intention,</hi> that is, in fewer
hours than most simple fleshy
Wounds are days or weeks in
curing; which certainly will
prove of great advantage to
you, whether you be a Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian,
Surgeon, Apothecary, or

neither; for it is the Publick
good I aim at in this Treatise,

For which, in
recompence, some Apotheca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
some Physicians, and
some near Neighbours, did ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
lately combine into a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy
against my Life and
Estate; but if that should
miss, they were resolved not to
miss their stroke in stabbing my
Reputation: And what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence

            <head>THE
Medical &amp; Chirurgical
CASE
OF A
NOBLE-MAN.</head>
            <p n="1">§ 1. FRom the esteem of those
numerous observations
in Physick communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the World, is
greatly detracted by the Romancing
vein of their Authors, or by being
so common and vulgar, that they
seem no novelty to every Nurse:
So that they are onely very few
that recompense Physitians for their
pains in reading of them; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
those few, the Case I am
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:62336:5"/>
now describing, may merit a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marque
for rarity and variety of
Symptomes, equal to any ever pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished;
assuring you, there shall be
nothing inserted here, what is not
respondent to the truth in the least
particular; though nothing is more
to be regretted, than that an acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
so unfortunate in all its cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances,
both of the Wound,
Cure, and Mistakes, should befall a
person, whose Magnanimity, Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
ancient Descent, and other
singular Endowments, did render
him a true English Nobleman, and
Peer of the Realm.</p>
            <p n="2">§ 2. His Lordship received a Wound
in the right <hi>Hypocondre,</hi> the Sword
entring about an Inch more or less
(by conjecture) below the short
Ribs, almost perpendicular to the
right Pap, and passing thwart down
through the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> seemed to stop
on the <hi>Os coxendix</hi> (or hip bone)
somewhat above the <hi>Acetabulum.</hi>
The Sword felt very cold as it pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:62336:5"/>
and on this side the terminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
near the Groin, made a prick or
puncture so smart, that it caused his
Lordship to fall down; which also
occasioned a great Bruise or Contusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
on the Hip; that is, a contusion
of the <hi>Musculi glutaei,</hi> and the <hi>Cutis</hi>
above them. <hi>His Lordship got up
again, and walked to some consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
distance, until he arrived at
a person of Quality's house in,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="3">§ 3. My Lords constitution of
Body was strong and vigorous;
his Temperament Hot and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mid,
that is, Sanguine; his Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit
replete, fleshy, and well-coloured:
he was <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that is,
of good and sound Bowels; aged
near eight and twenty; his <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
was onely observable in this, that
his Nature could in no manner bear
strong Catharticks; whereas on the
other hand, the gentlest Lenitives
or Laxatives, and Eccoproticks, in
a very moderate Dose, would ever
operate plentifully with him, and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62336:6"/>
that upon occasion <hi>cum</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. My
Lord's <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> (if I may so term it)
was a most passionate aversion
from the Roman-Catholick Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and a great inclination to
Learning and Languages; wherein
he was so far advanced, as to be
noted to be an universal Scholar;
an expert Linguist, and an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Mathematician. His Candour
and Affability rendred him belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
of all persons of whatsoever
degree, that had the honour of
knowing him. He was undaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the greatest of dangers, as
appeared in the late Sea-fights, in
which he served his Majesty as a
<hi>Voluntier.</hi> He was entirely just in
his actions, and free of all manner
of Debaucheries of the Times.</p>
            <p n="4">§ 4. After a short repose at the
place above-mentioned, his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
was advised to send for a Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon
nearest at hand, who proved
to be a French man: He no sooner
came, but immediately probed the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:62336:6"/>
Wound, which finding to pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate
into the hollow of the Belly,
cram'd in a Tent, armed I suppose
with some Stegnotick, though
without any great occasion, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
the Wound did issue forth but
a small proportion of Blood. This
done, he took away some eight or
nine ounces of blood out of the
right Arm.</p>
            <p n="5">§ 5. Whether the foresaid French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mam
was a Barber, a Blood-letter,
or Surgeon, I know not, being
wholly unacquainted with his edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
by which at <hi>Paris</hi> one is
obliged to be Apprentice four
years to a Master-surgeon of <hi>Paris,</hi>
and afterwards examined: or if
he hath attained to his profession
with some Master abroad, he is to
serve three years in one of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spitals
of <hi>Paris</hi> before he can be
admitted Master-surgeon of <hi>Paris.</hi>
Neither is this French man, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to my information, received
among the Company of Surgeons
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:62336:7"/>
at <hi>London</hi> as a forain Brother: So
that if he was not a Master-surgeon
of <hi>Paris,</hi> or other great City, nor
yet a forein Brother in <hi>England,</hi>
I judge it was a great presumption
in him to offer to dress so great a
person as his Lordship.</p>
            <p n="6">§ 6. However, he hath the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reputation
of a Surgeon here, which
any French Lacquey, having one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
served a Barber ten or twelve
moneths, and coming into <hi>England</hi>
provided with a <hi>Pot of Turpentine,
a Lancet, and a stock of impudence,</hi>
shall never miss of, <hi>viz.</hi> of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
of a famous Surgeon lately
come out of <hi>France.</hi> By the first
ingredient he is to cure you of the
<hi>Chaude Pisse;</hi> by the second, of the
Fever; and by the third ingredient
it is he makes you believe he is as
great a Physician as he is a Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon;
whereas in effect, he is onely
<hi>a Surgeon of the three Ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">§ 7. The first Physician sent for,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62336:7"/>
was my self, having served his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
in that capacity seven or eight
years; but not being in Town, Dr.
<hi>Polyphemus</hi> his assistance was desir'd,
who immediately prescribed Cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
Oyntments, Fomentations,
Cordials, and what not, to fill up
the Sheet, in order to remove, or
at least to appease the violent pain
of the left side in the lower part of
the Belly, among Physicians ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
the <hi>Hypogastrick region.</hi> What
the Prescriptions contained, the
Doctor's own Apothecary knows
best; neither can I speak further of
them, than that in the time of four
and twenty hours, or somewhat
longer, the Bill amounted to three
pounds odde shillings.</p>
            <p n="8">§ 8. Dr. <hi>Polyphemus</hi> observing
the storm of Symptomes to increase
upon him, in point of prudence
did not judge it convenient to see
himself sole Pilot in a Sea where
so many Sands and Rocks might
possibly environ him, and he not
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:62336:8"/>
perceive 'em; he therefore pressed
that some more able Head-pieces
might be joyned to his, by which
means, if a Shipwrack should hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen,
they could readily excuse one
another; it being customary to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Physicians, first to consult their
own reputation and profit, and
next to that, the welfare of their
Patients. To answer that indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Dr. <hi>Timon</hi> and the <hi>Ephesian</hi>
Doctor were called in. The first
thing in debate was, what parts
were hurt; for the discovery of
which, they commanded their
French Surgeon to make his soun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings,
which he performed not
by the Probe, but by his Fingers,
screwing one or two of them into
the Wound, and turning them
round: upon the forcing them out
again certifi'd his Principals, that the
<hi>Peritonaeum</hi> was divided, his Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
having grated quite round and
round the Perforation, and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seqvently
the Sword must have
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:62336:8"/>
passed through the hollow of the
Belly. Whereupon the eloquent
Dr. <hi>Polyph.</hi> according to the usual
custome of his Polyglot, did dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
himself in a most elegant Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangue,
(which some in Burlesque
term, prating, a quality more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
the Stage, than a Patients
Bed-side.) The substance was, That
Wounds are more or less dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
according to the parts that
are hurt; therefore it were highly
incumbent upon them in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture
to make use of their best
Anatomical craft; in which parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
the learned Dr. <hi>Timon,</hi> by his
industrious and most minute dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sections
of Animals and their parts,
as Heads, Plucks, Dogs, Cats, at
<hi>Oxford</hi> (humane Carcasses being
very rare there) hath acquired so
great a share (<hi>as appears in his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregious
piece</hi> de C.) that he
might with right challenge the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of Speaker in that little Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
whose determination then was:
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:62336:9"/>
First, That the Liver was not hurt.
Second, That the Sword slid over
the Guts (being slippery) under
the <hi>Peritonaeum.</hi> Further this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent
saith not.</p>
            <p n="9">§ 9. Next Dr. <hi>Polyphemus</hi> flung
in his Anatomical Talent, implying
the external coat of the <hi>Colon</hi> to
be raced by the Point of the Sword.
Moreover, That the Sword did
not pass under the bowels, (a sort
of expression I never expected
from any Physitian) and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
that the <hi>Mesentery</hi> escaped
being pierced.</p>
            <p n="10">§ 10. The Doctor of <hi>Ephesus,</hi>
then not a Fellow, nor indeed so
much as a Candidate, spoke last,
and least, and closed with them
both in a <hi>concedo totum.</hi> Should
I pass by this last Doctor's care, I
should eclipse his merit: For though
every night either one of the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons,
Apothecary, or their men,
were pressing to watch with his
Lordship, yet the Doctor's passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:62336:9"/>
care did oft exclude them, to
prefer himself to sit up all night;
for which service he was ever sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted
next Morning with three
Guinies, besides Pipes, Tobacco,
Wine, Ale, and paying the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary
for the <hi>Opium,</hi> which was
usually given when the Doctor
watched.</p>
            <p n="11">§ 11. The French-Surgeon (who
hath the honour of being called Dr.
<hi>Polyph.</hi> his Surgeon, whether from
following his Coach, or from being
his Tributary, I know not) had
the boldness to say, in the presence
of two Noblemen, and before the
Physicians faces, <hi>The Doctor be all
mistaken, it be neider de Liver,
neider de Gut, neider de Bladder;
but it be de Kiddenay be hurt;</hi> and
did undertake to prove it mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matically,
<hi>viz.</hi> The Sword entred
just under the short Ribs on the
right side, which is one Angle;
thence passed thwart over to the
<hi>Kidde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>y,</hi> which makes another
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:62336:10"/>
Angle; whence again the Point
might easily be retorted to the
Groin, which compleats the third
Angle: so that here you have a
Wound made in a Triangle; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
that if the Point of the Sword
should not have reached the Groin,
by consent of parts the pain might
very well have been communicated
from the Kidney thither. I confess
had he not smiled when he deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
this impertinency, I could not
have inferred him a rational <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal</hi>
from his discourse, but onely
from his Risibility; and for that
reason have not thought it seemly
to insert the least Letter of his
Name among those so eminently
learned men, as are mentioned, and
to be mentioned in this Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</p>
            <p n="12">§ 12. Still more Eyes were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired;
and to that end Dr. <hi>W.</hi>
was invited into their <hi>Conclave;</hi> of
whose sharp-sighted ingeny nothing
was less doubted than a clear dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:62336:10"/>
of the seat and cause of
those pains that continually tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured
this Noble person. Anatomy
had oft shewed him that the left
<hi>Vreter</hi> commonly took its way not
far off from that region, within
whose circumference the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
pains were limited; the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
of Urine thereunto being
added, whereby his Lordship was
at intervals much incommoded,
were Arguments sufficient enough
to induce him to believe the left
<hi>Vreter</hi> to be pierced through.</p>
            <p n="13">§ 13. Affairs daily appearing in
a worse dress than other, it was pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
resolved among the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned
experienced and learned
Doctors, that since in all appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
a fatal determination would
suddenly (in their opinions) hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen,
that to render their frustrane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
consultations more authentick,
it was highly necessary to admit
into the <hi>Cabal</hi> Mr. Pres. the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of Physick, and Father to the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:62336:11"/>
Family of Physicians; likewise Dr.
<hi>Nemo,</hi> their elder Brother and Elect,
whose deep learning is so univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally
noted, that his abode can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be unknown to any that shall
but cast an eye upon the Frontis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece
of that elaborate Dispensato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the last Edition. By these,
whatever had been done by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
before, was ratified and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed;
and whatever hereafter
should be acted, done, or perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
should also be approved and
corroborated by them. So that it
might seem not a little strange to
hear people talk of miscarriages,
errors, and I know not what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
discourses concerning the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding
Physicians, here being the
greatest and undeniable Authority
to bear them out; therefore this
may be an <hi>Item</hi> to all persons, that
if any of their Relations, as Father,
or Wife, should happily die under
the care of such or such a Physici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
not to mutter or mumble that
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:62336:11"/>
they miscarried, or might have been
recovered, or the like; because
the Physician (if legal, as they call
it) acteth <hi>cum privilegio;</hi> and it
shall be ratified at any time that
they died learnedly; and this in
Law is adjudged to be a competent
satisfaction.</p>
            <p n="14">§ 14. Though several parts were
respectively by these great men in
their scrutiny proposed to be affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
as you have read; yet in the
whole their counsel cannot be dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to be divided, no more than
when any thing is supposed to be
lost, it is determined by the seekers
to look for it in places (though
never so distant and absurd) as
well where it is not, as where it is:
and so it was in this case, especially,
when his Lordships Relation, out
of curiosity hiding her self behinde
the Curtains in the Room where
the Consultation was held, heard
them conclude thus: <hi>Let the pain
be in this part, that, or the other
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:62336:12"/>
part, let us order a Clyster, for that
can do no hurt:</hi> and so it was una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimously
carried; and for this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
several Guinees were distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
which however can hardly be
said that it was respondent to the
new Motto, <hi>Come, let us prescribe
for our Fees.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="15">§ 15. In the next grand mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
according to the account I
had from the same person of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
it was held necessary to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise
Barley-water for the Patient's
ordinary drink; for which care
the like number of Guinees was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented:
and for a third Consulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
where Milk and Water was
agreed on, they were rewarded
with such another sum. So you
may observe with what care and
mature deliberation Medicines
were particularly advised one by
one, and not thronged in by num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers;
yet alas!</p>

§ 16. But Reader, be not tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sported
in your amazement at the
extraordinary industry of these
Physicians, in pitching upon such
simple (that is, single) Medicines,
as were just before mentioned to
you, when two other Physicians
of the Cabal did by far outvie
them in their care, in prescribing
a Pippin roasted to their Patient
for his every nights supper; and to
shew of what importance the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
of it is, they fell into a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
debate, whether it ought
to be roasted in a <hi>brown Paper,</hi>
or a <hi>Vine-leaf.</hi> The Contest grew
high, though at last agreed upon the
Vine-leaf, as being more medicinal.
Likewise in the case of my Lord,
about a moneth before his decease,
it was thought necessary to call in
two of the learnedest Physicians of
<hi>London,</hi> who having taken an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
inspection of the Disease, and
particulaly examined all my Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions,
did positively aver,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:62336:13"/>
that the Disease and Causes could
be no other than what I had disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
them to be, and the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
expressed in the Bills to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
proper: Furthermore they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
me to retire with them into
the next Room to consult; which I
excused, alleadging, that it would
be more convenient for them both
onely to consult together, to have
their free scope, and prescribe what
they thought fit, that his Lordship's
Relations and others might see
what they could advise, whether
it should be the same, or different,
or something more than what was
in use then, which on purpose I
kept concealed from them. They
wrote down, 1. An Hypnotick
(or sleeping) Potion. 2. A Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regorick
Liniment. 3. An Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyne
and Traumatick Glyster.
4. A Vulnerary Decoction. This
done, his Lordship's Relation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
the Resolves of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult;
which being expressed to her,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:62336:13"/>
she was pleased to render this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer:
As for the <hi>Hypnotick,</hi> that
in the opinion of all people hath
been adjudged to be the principal
cause of my Lord's ruine. Touching
the Oyntment, there is one made use
of now, which is seldom appli'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
success. A Vulnerary Drink also
is daily taken, by vertue of which
my Lord was (not long since) so well
recovered, as to enable him to go
forth two moneths together. A
Glyster is given every afternoon,
or at least every other day, the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of which hath been sufficiently
approved. Wherefore if you have
thought upon nothing else, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
that the Medicines that are
at present made use of, ought rather
to be continued, than to run the
risque of others, though of the same
kinde; and so I thank you for your
pains and trouble. But that for
which I produced this instance,
was once more to offer to your
view the great caution that's ever
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:62336:14"/>
concomitant to the Learned in their
joynt advises: for upon my return
into the <hi>Consult-room,</hi> I found the
two Doctors at some variance; the
one preferring <hi>brown Sugar</hi> to be
dissolved in the Glyster last spoken
of, and the other striving hard for
<hi>Sugar-candy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="17">§ 17. Before I arrive to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cital
of the practical attempts of
these grand Physicians, let's pause a
while upon the variety of their
Sentiments touching the parts hurt.
The Anatomical Physician in his
Essay, declares with a pensive gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,
that the Liver was not hurt;
which, considering onely the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
of the Sword, and the posture
his Lordship stood in when the
Wound was given, (a circumstance
necessarily to be considered) was
easily determined. My Lord's Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary
standing upon a high guard,
with his Sword-arm straight exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
his Lordship made a Pass
upon the <hi>Seconde</hi> (being the onely
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:62336:14"/>
thrust the other lay open to) with
a ful <hi>allonge;</hi> upon which his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary
<hi>took time,</hi> by dropping his
Point, and pursuing it with a thrust
on the <hi>tiers,</hi> by which the Sword
happened to enter a little below
the short Ribs on the right side,
and passed thwart downwards to
the inside of the left Hip; so that he
holding up his Wrist, and turning
the Point of his Sword down, and
thereupon making a Pass with an
<hi>allonge</hi> upon his Lordship, standing
in the posture aforesaid, must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
have mist the Liver, and
passed through the <hi>Mesentery</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the small Guts downwards;
whereas if one standing on his
guard in somewhat a higher po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture,
had received a <hi>quart</hi> thrust
made straight, and the Sword had
entred a little below the short Ribs
on the right side, and had passed
directly thwart over, then the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
could not have escaped being
wounded; and in all probability
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:62336:15"/>
the <hi>Colon</hi> and the Spleen also would
have been hurt (supposing the
Sword had passed quite through)
or if it had descended onely a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
downwards, then the Kidney in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
might have been hurt, as the
<hi>French</hi>-man inconsiderately asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
So that you may observe how
requisite it is to take notice of the
circumstances. In fine, I conceive
that that learned Dr. was too short
(I crave his excuse for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression)
in his discovery, there
being other parts hurt then not
thought on.</p>
            <p n="18">§ 18. He that suspected the <hi>Colon</hi>
to be toucht, must also have infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
that a Wound in that part,
though in the external Tunick, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
into an Ulcer, would soon
have perforated the other Coats of
that Gut; and consequently Blood
and Matter issuing out at the stool,
would have been evident signes
of it; besides, the Excrements e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
time passing by, whether na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:62336:15"/>
or by Glyster, must also
have occasioned inflammations and
smart pains, and probably some
part of the Excrements would now
and then have been thrown into
the capacity of the <hi>Abdomen.</hi> If
according to the opinion of the
other Physician, one of the <hi>Vreters</hi>
had been divided, there must soon
have ensued a Dropsie upon it.</p>
            <p n="19">§ 19. The Chirurgical part was
performed by two <hi>French</hi>-men,
whose <hi>devoires</hi> were to heal the
Wound of the right <hi>Hypochondre</hi>
by several intentions, <hi>viz.</hi> by stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
the bleeding, digesting, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging,
incarning, and cicatrizing;
whereby on purpose it was kept
open for many days, though against
the rules of the most experienced
Surgery; there hapning, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
doth, 1. Cholerick Vomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings.
2. Smart gripes of the
Guts. 3. A Wound-feaver; and
all this, besides other Symptomes, by
keeping the Wound open, through
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:62336:16"/>
which the crude nitro-salin air enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into the Body, causes such an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
and alteration on the Guts
and Bowels, as produceth those
mischiefs aforesaid. Moreover, if
the Remedies to remove such ill at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants
be not properly applied,
then there is an addition of new
concomitants, whereby at last the
Patient is obliged to yield to his
unfortunate Period, and this by
the first mistake of curing a Wound:
so that it is in Chirurgical practice,
as it is in the way of reasoning,
<hi>Admisso uno absurdo, conceduntur
mille.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="20">§ 20. Wounds are kept open
either for to give passage in extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
some extraneous Body, as a
Bullet, Splinter, a piece of a Sword,
or Lance; or to purge extravasate
Blood, or other Juices, that Nature
may convert into an <hi>Ichor, Sanies,
Pus,</hi> or other matter at the Orifice
of the Wound. Now in this case
of his Lordship, whatever Blood,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:62336:16"/>
or other matter should be supposed
to have been extravased or issued
out of the Vessels, disseminated
through those parts that were hurt,
it must necessarily through its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
propensity of weight have
descended down into the <hi>Pelvis,</hi> or
bottom of the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> granting
the <hi>Peritonaeum</hi> to be divided: if
so, how could it rationally be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,
that the foresaid matter
lodging in the bottom of the Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
should be evacuated at the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
part, unless the Patient were
hung every day by the Heels with
his Head downwards? neither
then would it be feasible, in regard
that the <hi>Epiploon</hi> and the Guts
would by such a counternatural
position cram and fill up the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of the Wound, by which the
forementioned matter would be
intercepted. Another inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
that is consequent to pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating
Wounds of the upper part
of the Belly, is the <hi>Epiploon,</hi> or
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:62336:17"/>
the Guts, or both, do ever after up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Coughing, or by lying on that
side, or otherways, make such a
Protuberance there, as is observed
to happen upon ruptures, or <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia's;</hi>
which also upon this way of
cure befel his Lordship, being
thereby rendered subject upon the
least Cough, or lying on his right
side, to be extreamly incommoded
with a Protuberance of the bigness
of a Fist, more or less; for which
we advised a Truss, such as I had
seen another wear before, being
wounded in the Belly, and ill cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
            <p n="21">§ 21. The last, and for what I
know, the greatest mischief, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
this way of cure was the <hi>occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sional
cause</hi> (a term best under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
by the three first named Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians)
was, that nature was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
from her work, namely of
protruding the extravase Blood,
that might be suspected to be fallen
down into the Cavity of the <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domen,</hi>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:62336:17"/>
towards the Groin, or other
external part, to be converted into
an Imposthume, as on the like oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
hath been oft observed.
2. Of discussing through the Pores,
or carrying off the Gleet (which
otherwise soon turns into a <hi>Virus</hi>) by
Urine, as daily remarques on such
cases do sufficiently evince. 3. Of
thickning and concocting the ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
juice (that by a Wound or
puncture of a Nerve is rendred
thin and acrimonious) by Natures
Balsamick vertue, whereby a pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
is soudered and consolidated.
Of all these three intentions, I say,
Nature was diverted, by keeping
the Wound open; which occasio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
unsufferable Gripes, Vomitings,
and a Wound-feaver; by which
means the spirits were put into
a tumult and outrage, dispersed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
several parts, which otherwise
would in three or four days have
easily healed both the Puncture and
external Wound.</p>
            <p n="22">
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:62336:18"/>
§ 22. I am not onely to tell you
how this accident ought not to be
cured, but also am obliged to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
the manner how his Lordship
in probability might have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
in fewer hours than he
survived Weeks. The external
Wound, for the reasons alledged
before, ought to have been cured
by the <hi>first intention</hi> onely, which
is Agglutination or Consolidation,
whereunto a Wound is easily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted,
by applying the lips toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and retaining them so, either
by Bandage, Suture-plaster, or Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
according to the position of
the part, and circumstances of the
discontinuity; supposing there was
no extraordinary Hemorrhage, or
expectation of extraneous Bodies
to be extracted, or matter to be
repurged, Tendons and Nerves to
be recently hurt, so as to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
no prejudice from the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bient
Air, or its own Gleet, which
immediately turns into a <hi>Virus,</hi> and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:62336:18"/>
the whole Wound fresh, to which
its own Blood oft serves for the best
<hi>Gluten</hi> and Balsam. But if by long
retardation the extravase Blood
should have been coagulated, then
it must be washed off with a little
warm'd red Wine, and immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon it the Lips are to be clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.</p>
            <p n="23">§ 23. In case of a Haemorrhage
in a fresh Wound, hapning upon
the division of some of the capil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
or greater Arteries or Veins,
make use onely of this styptick Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor,
<hi>viz.</hi> Put three parts of <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cothar,</hi>
one part of common Allom,
and one of <hi>Sal Prunellae,</hi> powdred
and mixed together, into a Bolts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,
affusing on them as much
Spirit of Wine not rectified, as may
swim atop two Inches; digest them
in Ashes eight and forty hours, or
longer, then decant the Liquor;
with this wet some dry Lint, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
into a loose Pledget, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
it to the Wound so, that each
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:62336:19"/>
particle thereof may assuge some
part of the evaporation of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor:
this being continued until
the Haemorrhage be sufficiently
checkt; then close the Lips, apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the same Pledget atop, newly
wetted again, and put a Compress
on each side of the Lips, about one
Inch more or less distant from them;
and over that make a Bandage ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the structure of the part
and figure of the Wound.</p>
            <p n="24">§ 24. Possibly what concerns
simple fleshy Wounds, their cure
by the first intention may universal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be approved to be the best and
speediest, barring the exceptions
hinted to before, and some few o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
but it is much scrupled
where Nerves or Tendons are pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctured
or divided, where Gleet, if
imprisoned by a sudden consolida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the circumjacent wounded
fleshy parts, doth cause most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
Pains, Inflammations, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posthumes,

Syncopees, and upon their
continuation, Death.</p>
            <p n="25">§ 25. Surgery is in no part less
improved than in this particular,
which though punctures of Nerves
or Tendons daily happen upon
unskilful bleedings, yet allowing,
they dilate the cuticular Orifice
to give vent to the Gleet, <hi>sanies,</hi>
or other matter that may be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendered,
and so endeavour to cure
the Wound by several intentions,
notwithstanding it's frequently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marqued,
that few escape without
great tortures, large tumours, lame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
or the loss of the whole Limb,
and sometimes of Life; and all this
by reason the Gleet is not sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
stopt, the Puncture healed, and
the Air kept out, by a speedy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solidation
of the supercubant
wounded sanguine parts.</p>
            <p n="26">§ 26. Now to prevent all these
mischiefs, and to answer those va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
indications by one single in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
I will do the Publick that
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:62336:20"/>
service, to impart a Medicine so pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrable
as to reach a wounded
Nerve, Tendon, or any nervous
parts, though in the remotest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
of the Body, and so congluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>native
and balsamick, that it will
stop the Gleet, and consolidate the
divided Nerve, and other wounded
parts, in an interval of time so short,
that onely your trial of it can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
you to believe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Medicine is the following Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Take Oyl of Therebinthin what
proportion you please, which by
gentle evaporation in Sand reduce
to a Balsam; adde to it as much
<hi>Colchotar</hi> of Vitriol as will serve to
impastate it into the consistence of
an Electuary; hereon pour as much
Spirit of Wine, once rectified, as
will swim atop five or six Fingers
breadth; digest it in Sand, until the
Spirit of Wine be sufficiently im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:62336:20"/>
or clogged with the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sam;
then decant it, pour on the
remaining Balsam the same measure
of Spirit of Wine, which being
sufficiently digested, decant it. Pour
the decantations into a Glass-body,
fasten the Head to it, and abstract
the Spirit of Wine in <hi>Balneo M.</hi>
until what remains in the Glass-bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
be of the consistency of a Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sam
or thick O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l.</p>
            <p>You may observe, if you make
use of compound <hi>Balsam of Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur,</hi>
instead of the Balsam of The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rebinthin,
impastate it with the
<hi>Colchotar,</hi> and extract it as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said,
it may be preferred in some
cases.</p>
            <p>The Application is in manner
following: The discontinuity of
the Nerve, or nervous part, not
being very remote from the surface
of the Body, you are to drop a few
drops warm'd into the Orifice of
the Wound, having first, by wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with warm'd red Wine, or
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:62336:21"/>
gentle compression, removed the
coagulated Blood out of the
Wound, that may intercept the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netration
of the Balsam to the parts
intended; afterwards uniting the
Lips, impose upon them a Pledget
armed with a few drops of the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sam;
and with, or without Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses,
according to the condition
of the Wound make your Bandage.
But if a nervous part be supposed
injured in a more retired scituation
of the Body, a proportionable
number of drops of the same Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sam
is to be instilled into a small
quantity of white Sugar, and then
dissolved in a draught of red Wine,
or vulnerary sanative Decoction,
which taken inwardly twice or
thrice a day, will soon reduce the
Patient to a perfect recovery.</p>
            <p>What I have here proposed, is
to be apprehended onely to relate
to the manner of cure, by the first
intention; in the mean while, if the
Patient be plethorick, costive, or
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:62336:21"/>
attended with particular Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptomes;
bleedings, evacuations,
and other means, are left to the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion
of the Physician, or Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon,
to be administred according
to the emergencie of the occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>Though among Vulnerary Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines
these before-mentioned are
the best I know, yet the many
experiments of <hi>his Majesty</hi>'s <hi>Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerary
Drops</hi> on Wounds, and some
penetrating also, (which in point
of danger might seem to exceed
that of his Lordships in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning)
so speedily and safely cured
by them, is an evident demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that it is the most excelling
of Medicines that ever was inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
considering how pleasant it is,
and amicable to all the Spirits, and
yet so extraordinary penetrating
and sanative. These <hi>Royal Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerary
Drops</hi> were procured by
the Right Honorable my Lord <hi>H.</hi>
and sent from him to his Lordship
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:62336:22"/>
by Monsieur, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
signified to the Physicians,
after they had sufficiently abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the said Monsieur, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for
his pains, they declared it was
a Medicine they did not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand;
they knew not what it was,
and therefore would not give their
consent it should be used; adding
withal this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>die sort of menace,
That if his Lordship did take it,
they would come at him no more
(Would to God they had not) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
my Lord had onely made use
of the foresaid <hi>Vulnerary Drops.</hi>
I am assured, by all what I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
of the circumstances of that
Wound, and the manner how it
ought to have been cured, (which
I have already expressed to you)
it was very possible he might have
been living at this hour, and have
given his Gracious Majesty thanks
for saving his life, by the service
that a Noble-man of his vigorous
years, and extraordinary qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:62336:22"/>
might enable him to.
But then we should have lost our
Fees and Reputation, for not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
the Cure. This puts me
in minde of a French Surgeon at
the <hi>Hague,</hi> (a sort of people to be
found almost in all places, where
the price of bleeding exceeds two
pence half penny) who being met
by a friend in the street, was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
of whither he was going in
so great haste; t'other replied, <hi>To
get a brave Gelding, or a fat Ox, out
of a Gentleman's Leg;</hi> Which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
but superficially hurt, he to
accomplish his designe, did by sharp
gnawing Ointments and Plaisters,
purposely widen the Wound, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
at length by his tampering a
Gangrene hapned, and thereupon
his Leg was taken off below the
Knee, which soon after put a period
to his life. Now had this Wound
been cured by the first intention,
in two or three days, then the
Monsieur would have been disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:62336:23"/>
of his fat Ox; or had he
suffered another Surgeon more
knowing and expert than himself
to be called in to his assistance,
which by the rules of honesty and
conscience he ought to have done,
when he found himself in an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
and the Patient in apparent
danger; but, thought he, then his
<hi>male</hi> practice, his ignorance, and
want of skill would be detected,
especially should one be called in
that was not of his Colledge at
<hi>Paris,</hi> and possibly one that might
have known the Constitution of
this Patients Body for several years.
No, saith the French-man, it's bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for my Reputation that this
man, and a hundred more, die un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
my hands, than that I suffer
one to go from me not cured, to be
recovered by another; for the
<hi>Grave hides a multitude.</hi> But
would the Patients Relations have
had five or six of his Colledge at
<hi>Paris</hi> sent for, these he would glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:62336:23"/>
consult with, (for many Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
can easier carry a Corpse to
the Church-yard than one) and
the method is usually thus. Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
(saith he in ordinary) I holp
you out t'other day at a dead lift,
and you, and you, and you; here
is a Patient whose Leg is gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gren'd,
he will die; I have made
such and such applications: Then
they conclude one and all, this
Gangrene was occasioned by the
Patient's ill diet and disorders. Yes,
Brother, saith another <hi>Cox-comb,</hi>
this Gangrene is Hereditary, his
Father died of a Gangrene in the
Kidneys; you have done what
man could do, he is a dead man;
but continue still the same applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
until he is certainly dead, lest
another should come in and set him
up again; for that would prove
a great scandal to our whole So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety.</p>
            <p>Before I recede from my Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
give me leave to prevent your
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:62336:24"/>
suspecting it fabulous, by making
appear, that it's very possible for
a French-man, though onely a
Corn-cutter, a Shaver, or Blood-letter,
to pass for an excellent Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon.
First he shall shew you a
rare show of glittering Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
then charm your Ears with
prating of hard words; by flea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a Dog or Cat before two
or three Novices as Witnesses, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
himself an Anatomist: If he
mangles a Muscul into two parts, he
triumphs in the Character of being
the greatest Anatomist in the world,
in regard he hath first discovered
all Musculs to have two Bellies;
whereas, poor fellow, besides a false
experiment or two upon the <hi>ductus
Chyliferus,</hi> or transfusing of Blood,
is utterly ignorant of the whole
System of Anatomy: and lastly,
with a <hi>Stentorophonia,</hi> howls it
out, <hi>he is one of the Colledge of</hi>
Paris, which engrosses all; and
therefore needs to give no other
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:62336:24"/>
account, though he be never so great
a <hi>Quidam.</hi> The same arrogance
is assumed by the Physicians of the
faculty of <hi>Paris,</hi> which is the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
also, who therefore suffer
none to mount on Asses, or rather
Mules, to visit Patients in the City,
but themselves; whereas those o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Physicians that are graduated
at <hi>Monpellier,</hi> or other famous U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversities,
have onely the liberty
of practising in the Suburbs; so
that if a person of Quality should
happen to fall sick in the City of
<hi>Paris,</hi> he is obliged to live and die
under one of the Physicians of the
faculty; and if by Prognostick he
is sentenced to die by one of them,
if he sends for twenty more, he
will get no reprieve. For this
reason, many Gentlemen, whose
sickness will permit them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move,
make choice of the <hi>Faux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourgs,</hi>
where they may advise with
what Physicians they please, whose
Learning and Experience doth not
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:62336:25"/>
consist in a mere formality of being
of the Colledge of <hi>Paris,</hi> but it's
derived from their close studies, and
industry in attaining to every Branch
of the Art of Physick, as Anatomy,
Pathologie, Chirurgery, Botanicks,
Pharmacy, Chymistry, travelling
to most of the renown'd Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities
of <hi>Europe;</hi> visiting the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spitals
in all places, and observing
cases, and fishing out of Professors
what it's possible for them to learn.
So that it hath been oft obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
that those that could not be
cured in the City, were easily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
in the Suburbs. This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
represented to <hi>his Majesty of</hi>
France, it was judged very injust,
that a Company of <hi>formal Fops</hi>
should, by their invincible By-laws,
exclude so many Learned men, and
by that disable them for practising;
and therefore, whoever he be that
lieth sick in <hi>Paris,</hi> must either be
kill'd or cured by one of them,
and be mulcted according to his
discretion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:62336:25"/>
To remedy this, though his said
<hi>Majesty</hi> would not deprive them
of their ancient Priviledges, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
conferred on them by his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors,
yet thought it expedient
to erect a <hi>forein Colledge,</hi> into
which all Physicians that were gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duated
as Doctors in other Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities,
were incorporated, and
priviledged to practise in the City,
as well as Suburbs; which seemed
to be a Ballance to the faculty of
<hi>Paris;</hi> by which means if <hi>male</hi>
practice was committed by one of
the latter, it was immediately ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
notice of by some or other of
the former, and complaint made
to a superior power; and thus
vouching for one another, and kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<hi>cum previlegio,</hi> was at an end.
Another benefit that redounded
from instituting a <hi>forain Colledge,</hi>
was, that they were ever outvying
one another in Learning, Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
Cures: In fine, they were a
diametrical controul to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:62336:26"/>
a sick man might be sure he
should not be slattered, deceived,
or imposed upon in his Distemper,
or Purse, because there were their
opposites (I mean in emulation)
ready at hand to be called in upon
them.</p>
            <p>This new Constitution was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
very pleasing to many Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,
that had three or four Sons;
the Eldest claiming the Lands <hi>jure
Haereditario,</hi> one of the rest possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
might be intended for Physick,
on whose education in Learning,
Travelling, and taking his Degrees,
there must be a good sum of money
expended, and probably all his Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
now that this Physician so
honourably educated, should have
the priviledge denied him of pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctising
in the capital City of his
Country, by a Society of avari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
Monopolizing Physicians, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he will not repeat or take his
degrees over again among them, pay
3 or 4 thousand Livres, stoop to the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:62336:26"/>
meanest of them, though his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niors,
and cohere with them in all
their diabolical vouchings, errours,
and ill practices, was one of the
severest things, and worst of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes
imaginable. Neither was
this all; but whoever was admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
among them, was to swear, that
he would with all artifices, interest,
and power, declame all other Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians,
though duely educated and
graduated, especially those that
by their Industry, Studies, Travels,
and Experience, equal'd the best of
their Colledge, he was obliged to
Mountebank, and call them Quacks,
Ignorants, or any other vile name,
that might render them contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the people, to prevent them
in their Bud for ever coming to
any considerable employment in
Physick.</p>
            <p>The people at length grew in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censed,
and made it a grievance of
the Nation, that a Colledge-phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician
should, beyond their Prince,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:62336:27"/>
have a power of life and death
over them, without being liable to
an account for it: Neither did their
sollicitude rest here, but would
oft surmise, what if a brave spirited
Nobleman, or the Prince himself,
should be taken ill, his life and
their welfare must depend upon the
conjectural opinions of three or four
of these fellows; whereof if one by
a hired wilful mistake, errour, or
ignorance, doth act perniciously,
the rest will readily complie with
their Leader, unless controuled
and ballanced by others of a more
sincere and judicious temper. No
wonder then, that these men had
contracted the Character of <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians
of the three</hi> S. viz. <hi>Son,</hi>
meaning thereby a Glyster: <hi>Seigneé,</hi>
Bleeding: and <hi>Sena,</hi> intimating
Purging; expressing, as if they
could do nothing else, but blow
Wind in their Guts, bleed, and
scowre them. It was not keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Coach, and living in Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:62336:27"/>
that would longer perswade
people, they knew a whit the
more for that; comparing them
to some Merchants, who by living
splendid and high, had procured a
great credit, though looking into
their bottom, they found them not
worth a <hi>Sous marc.</hi> Therefore it
is easily believed, that the erecting
a <hi>forain Colledge</hi> was a great satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
to the Subject. But it's
time I should have done describing
those <hi>Colledge-fripons,</hi>

§ 61. But what need I, to justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
the foremeant Doctor, fetch a
president so far off, when there is
one nearer, in a notable instance (if
true) of a Physician, a degree
higher elevated in fame than he?
This Doctor was called in (as they
term it) upon another Physician,
not of the Colledge, to cure a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient;
he no sooner saw him, but
cries out, This is a sort of <hi>Asthma,</hi>
which my self and Dr. <hi>Willis</hi> first
found out, and named it <hi>Asthma
Convulsivum:</hi> But it's I only have
appropriated a Remedy to it. What
is't, demanded t'other Gentleman?
It is, quoth he, <hi>Spirit of Sal Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniac,</hi>
exhibited in the measure
of a Spoonful without any vehicle.
The other replied, I dare not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to it, without a good propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of liquor to dilute it. You are
over-cautious, quoth the <hi>Sal Armo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niac</hi>
Doctor, leave it to me, and
behold the Miracle. <hi>Nolens volens,</hi>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:62336:39"/>
given it was, but the Patient freely
expiring that day (which is more
than he had done many days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
his Lungs being obstructed)
prevented the Medicine of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
its effect, and the Doctor
of seeing the Miracle. Had the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
been dissected, without doubt,
they would have observed another
<hi>occasional cause,</hi> namely a very
sharp cutting <hi>Armoniac</hi> Rheum,
that had inflamed, corroded, and
excoriated the <hi>Oesophagus</hi> and Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,
and convelled the great
stomachic Nerves, whence derived
this convulsive <hi>Asthma,</hi> the nerves
of the <hi>Diaphragm</hi> being likewise
convelled by consent: excuse the
expression of attributing the word
Convulsion to the Nerves, it being
usually applied to Muscles. Now
it's apparent enough, that this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine
did exceed the former in
heat; but by the way remember,
that exhibiting it in that manner,
was <hi>Authoritas Medica,</hi> not to be
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:62336:40"/>
imitated by every Physician, nor
indeed by any, unless of very great
repute, no more than <hi>Steteruntque
comae,</hi> by every Poetical Paeda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue.
The relation of this fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned
consultation was given
me in the company and hearing of
twenty Physicians more, by the
same Physician, whom the other
was called in upon; from whose
reputation the credit of this instance
is to take its measure. But enough
of this, intending to be more at
large upon Miracles of this kinde
performed at <hi>Paris,</hi> in a Treatise,
entitul'd, <hi>The Conclave of Physici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
where the subtil and polite
Government of the Physical Pope
and his Cardinals, is discoursed
of.</p>
            <p n="62">§ 62. On the 27th and 28th of
<hi>Decemb.</hi> if you look back on the
<hi>Recipees,</hi> you will finde the Cordial
Juleps strained to a higher pitch of
heat, and throngs of Spirits; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
in the preceding treatment of
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:62336:40"/>
his Lordship, especially towards the
beginning, the Cordials were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
more moderate in heat, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
diluted with Simple Waters;
which as the Patients Symptomes
increased, were also thought fit to
be stimulated, and made quicker,
to keep pace with the Distemper,
until at last both had carreer'd into
an high Fever, as hereafter shall be
remarqued.</p>
            <p n="63">§ 63. What ever Curatory Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
are desumed, I have ever
observed, that some grand Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians
of, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> never are forgetful of
the <hi>Indicatio Vitalis;</hi> whereon
they lay so great a stress, that they
seem to prefer it before the Cure
of the Malady, and the removing
of the Cause: Insomuch, that
where-ever they come, the Scene
is a Cordial prescribed at the head
of the Scrowl, especially where the
Disease doth not manifest it self so
plainly to their apprehension; and
particularly in the Diseases of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:62336:41"/>
and big-bellied Women. This
sort of <hi>Cordial Practice</hi> sounding so
safe among the Vulgar, imposes a
necessity upon the <hi>minor</hi> Physici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
to move in the same Zodiac:
For should a Friend or Relation of
a Patient come to visit him, and
not see the small Vials on the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
with the Silken Stoppers, he
would rail the poor <hi>minor</hi> Prophet
out of doors, and cry out, <hi>He kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the sick man for want of a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial.</hi>
So that it's easily believed,
that the greatest estates are gotten
by prescribing of Cordials, and not
by curing Diseases. However, take
my meaning right, I do not hence
infer this Cordial Practice to be an
Imposture in those eminent Doctors,
but rather some Ruines of <hi>Paracel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi>
in their <hi>Pericranium;</hi> whence
you may justly term them <hi>Chymists:</hi>
for by their Cordials they intend
to fortifie the general <hi>Archeus</hi> in the
Stomach, or at least to make an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
or <hi>idea</hi> upon it (or to use
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:62336:41"/>
               <hi>Helmont</hi>'s phrase, a reflection like
upon a looking-glass) which being
successively continuated or propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated
(like streams in a water) unto
every particular <hi>Archeus,</hi> that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
over every part, a Disease,
and its <hi>occasional Cause,</hi> are expelled
in a moment; provided that their
Cordials are virtuated with those
Qualifications <hi>Helmont</hi> designed
for his <hi>Drif.</hi> But these are onely
<hi>Deliramenta Catarrhi,</hi> and so is oft
this <hi>Cordial Practice,</hi> unless when
put into use, it hath a power ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned
to oppose and remove the
Cause of the Disease. This pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised,
let's make enquiry whether
this Cordial Practice used from
the beginning upon my Lord,
might be accounted proper. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi>
Whether prescribing gentle
and moderate Cordials in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
and very strong and smart
ones towards the latter end, was
not much more improper.</p>
            <p n="63">§ 63. The Indication for Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dials
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:62336:42"/>
is taken from the defect of
the vital and animal Spirits, occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
by the loss of laudable Blood,
or a vitiated and diminuted <hi>Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosis,</hi>
whence Blood is not suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
engendred for matter to be
converted into Spirits and the <hi>Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus
nutritius,</hi> or by the loss of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
dispersed and consumed by
great Pains and Tortures, or what
other Cause, by the <hi>Phaenomenon</hi>
they then conceived, they please
to assign. The loss of Blood was
insignificant here; but the insuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable
pains in the lower part of
the Belly were great, through
which Sleep was interdicted, the
Spirits extremely depauperated,
and the Concoctions of the body
subverted, so that a proportionable
measure of Blood could not be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated.
To answer the Indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
surmised in this latter notion,
they prescribed the common Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dials
usual among them almost in all
Distempers; <hi>viz.</hi> Black-Cherry-water,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:62336:42"/>
Plague-water, Cinamon-water,
and <hi>Aqua mirabilis;</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
the one, and sometimes the
other. But what could these ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect?
You may believe, they could
not supply the twentieth part of
Spirits that were dayly exhausted.
Furthermore, it may be offered to
consideration, whether the foresaid
Cordials did not sharpen and fret
the Blood and Spirits, whereby the
pains might be render'd more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tense,
and their causes augmented;
which Method being continued,
what could the issue of it be, but
that which followed?</p>
            <p n="64">§ 64. To illustrate this to you in
a more familiar instance; Suppose
a man loaden with a burthen on his
shoulders so weighty, as to make
his Joynts shake and tremble under
him; if you give him a Dram of
the Bottle, he may support a little
the longer: though soon after, his
Joynts fall on shaking much more,
and then you relieve him with a
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:62336:43"/>
glass of Canary; which perceiving
to effect less than his first Cordial,
in regard the burthen on his shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
hath dispersed more Spirits, and
weakned him much more than the
first Cordial restored, or corrobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated,
you make a third essay (ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining
the former Cordials too
weak) and offer him a large dose
of <hi>Aqua mirabilis,</hi> upon which
suddenly comes tumbling down to
the ground, both man and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then.</p>
            <p n="65">§ 65. My observation upon this
is; 1. That the direct way to assist
this man, is to take off his burthen
from his shoulders, either all at
once, or by degrees; which will
prove the best Strengthner and
Cordial, especially if supplying
him with proportionable Corrobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratives.
2. That the weaker a
man groweth, his Cordials ought
to be less spirituous, and more
temperate; for else it will drown
and overwhelm his Spirits on a
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:62336:43"/>
sudden. But in these preceding
Prescripts, I finde the weakest
Cordials exhibited in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and the strongest towards
the end. However, since it was
concluded by such great Physici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
that the administration of
Cordials in that form and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was necessary, good manners
prompt me to declare, <hi>It was well
done, they did what men could do,
and they ought to have been sure to
continue it, until the Patient had
certainly,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="66">§ 66. For to appease and lay
the pains, <hi>Hypnoticks</hi> were fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
given: These by stupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
and condensing the Spirits,
gave his Lordship some intermission
of his tortures, during their opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
which no sooner was expir'd,
but they return'd into their accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed
fury. What followed?
My Lord was several times surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
with a total suppression of
Urine, a Symptome very dreadful:
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:62336:44"/>
But the <hi>Ephesian</hi> happily thought
on a small Wax-candle, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
forced into the <hi>Vrethra</hi> (or
passage of the Yard) not so far as
the <hi>Sphincter,</hi> did by stimulation
excite the <hi>facultas excretrix</hi> of the
Bladder, by which means his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
immediately discharged his
Urine. Now let's examine the
Cause of this Suppression: It was
not occasioned by the Stone; for
the Wax-candle did not penetrate
so far, as to be supposed to reach
it, and thrust it back; neither was
it any grumous Blood, Slime, or
Gravel, for the same reason. Then,
I hope, I may without offence, put
the question, Whether it was not
the too oft repeated <hi>Hypnoticks</hi>
and <hi>Opiates,</hi> that had stupefied the
Bladder, its <hi>Sphincter,</hi> and those
branches of Nerves that defer the
animal Faculty to both, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
the animal Spirits being
render'd torpid, had not force suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to evacuate the Urine,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:62336:44"/>
whence hapned that suppression.
That <hi>Opiats</hi> and <hi>Narcoticks</hi> are not
seldome attended with so ill a
Symptome, as the suppression of
Urine, needs no other proof, than
dayly Experience; and that his
Lordships suppression depended on
such like cause, the argument <hi>à


juvante</hi> seems evidently to infer,
which was a Wax-candle; that by
stimulating and exciting the sopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
faculty of the Bladder, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
an excretion of Urine. But
Modesty obliges me to say, This
was very well done, in regard such
great Masters of Medicine cannot
do amiss.</p>
            <p n="67">§ 67. All this while the Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians
were only vagrant in latitude,
receding from one Remedy to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and not gaining the least way in
longitude, but rather losing ground;
which made them come so oft to an
anchor, by giving of <hi>Opium.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
since they could not always
act <hi>Lulla by,</hi> nor the Patient con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:62336:45"/>
be detained in sleep, there
was a necessity of launching out,
and steering all manner of Courses,
to get into Port.</p>
            <p>First then, his Lordship's pains
were judged to proceed from a <hi>Coli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca
Biliosa,</hi> (or a hot Colick) which
they endeavoured to purge off by
their <hi>Laxative,</hi> prescribed on the
20th of <hi>November:</hi> What success
had this? By night they were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to summon in their whole <hi>Posse
Comitatus, viz.</hi> Cordial Juleps,
Fomentations, Bags, Hypnotic Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
two Anodyne Glysters, as
appears in their Prescriptions: the
next day the repetition of the
Purge was approved of, but Gly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
Anodyne Liniments, Pearl
Cordial, and the <hi>Hypnotic,</hi> were to
be in readiness. The 22th and
23th the <hi>Hypnotic</hi> (their <hi>Anchora
salutis</hi>) and Cordials were repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
On the 24th of <hi>Decemb.</hi> they
were resolved to try their fortune
once more, by purging of Phlegm
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:62336:45"/>
out of the Stomach; by which they
seem'd to intimate another opinion,
<hi>viz.</hi> That his Lordships Pains
issued from a Wind-Colick, the
Wind being occasioned by the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuation
of the Phlegm in the
Stomach, and posted thence into
the great Guts; whence it was to
be carried off by <hi>Pil. Ruffi,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="68">§ 68. Seeing the Pains proved
too obstinate to be longer suspect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for any, or all the sorts of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
they would now <hi>tentativè</hi> (a
term too much in use among them)
suppose these torments to be Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butic,
and the pain that oft excur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
as far as the Loins, to be a
<hi>Lumbago Scorbutica.</hi> About ship
again, steer large; orders were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
given to distil an <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scorbutic</hi>
Water or Spirit (or what
you please to term it) prescribed
on the 1 of <hi>Decemb.</hi> consisting of
Snails, Brooklime, Dandalyon,
Oranges, and Limons, Broom
flowers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And that you may
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:62336:46"/>
the better understand, that they
had treated his Lordship severally
and jointly as a Scorbutic Patient,
you may peruse their joint-Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
of the seventeenth of
<hi>Decemb.</hi> where it is determined,
that the Patient shall persevere in
the use of the <hi>Destillatum Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scorbuticum,</hi>
which is the proper
name they imposed upon their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
of the first of <hi>Decemb.</hi>
Moreover you may observe, that I
have not suggested these Diseases
from the vertues or intention of
their Bills, but from their expressed
words; as for further instance, in
their Record of the fourth of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember</hi>
you read, they term my
Lord's pains a Colick pain. Where
they seem for a while to leave off
their Scorbutic method, and convert
their whole efforts against the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
on fresh: Here Oyl of sweet
Almonds, Syrup of Marshmallows,
and Chamomil-water, are esteemed
as great Specificks: Their Auxili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aries
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:62336:46"/>
are Carminative Glysters, Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations,
Bags, Cordials, Balsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mics,
and Hypnotics, their old
friend. But <hi>Omnia incassum,</hi> still
worse and worse.</p>
            <p n="65">§ 65. Once more, and that for
the last, they are resolved to make
a bolt or a shot of it: They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred,
that My Lord had been
taken more than once with a sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
of Urine, a Symptome
that oft attends the Stone in the
Bladder, and that which proved
an <hi>Ignis fatuus</hi> to seduce our Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians
into a strange mistake: For
unto the foresaid Symptome of
Suppression, they added an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>current
pain of the Loins, Vomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
(now deemed a Symptome of
the Stone-Colick) pains above the
Groin, interpreted to be Vellica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Ureter by Gravel, or
small angular Stones: And lastly,
his Lordship's Father dying of the
Stone in the Kidneys, was an <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culean</hi>
Argument, that those great
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:62336:47"/>
Tortures were <hi>Nephritic</hi> Pains, and
the Disease no other than the Stone
in the Kidneys. This they confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
asserted to all my Lord's
Relations and Visiters; and they
made no doubt, but there were
Engines, Pickaxes, and Shovels,
that they could command out of
their Apothecaries Shop, whereby
they should easily dig the Stone
out of the Mine of the Kidneys.
To work they go with their edged
tools, and make their first attaque
with a <hi>Nephritic</hi> Purge, mark'd
down on the 8th of <hi>Decemb.</hi> this to
be seconded with a strong <hi>Laxative</hi>
and <hi>Diuretic</hi> Glyster; the next day
the assault to be renewed twice
with a <hi>Diuretic</hi> Apozem, virtuated
with the expression of fifty Hog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,
and within two hours to be
reinforced with the exhibition of
<hi>Opobalsamum,</hi> commonly called,
<hi>The Balm of Gilead,</hi> or the best sort
of a well-concocted <hi>Therebinthin,</hi>
exactly imitating the vertues of the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:62336:47"/>
Rosin of <hi>Venice:</hi> In summa, an
Imposture put upon the <hi>European</hi>
Christians, by <hi>Armenians</hi> and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian</hi>
Mahometans. But by the way
consider, the vast Dose of <hi>Hog-lice,</hi>
the <hi>Opobalsam,</hi> or <hi>Armenian</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binthin
upon that, and Therebin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thin
Glysters upon that again;
whereof some days four or five of
them were administred successively
one after another, each Glyster
containing four Ounces of <hi>Luca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellus</hi>'s
Balsam dissolved in it; so
that in twenty four hours there were
twenty or five and twenty Oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
that is, above a Pound and an
half of <hi>Lucatellus</hi>'s Balsam forced
into the Patient's Belly: How large
the proportion of <hi>Therebinthine</hi>
must be to make such a huge mass
of Balsam, is easily computed. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
all this, in the intervals were
exhibited Doses of Oyl of sweet
Almonds, Syrup of Marshmallows,
Balsamic Syrups, and a Decoction
of <hi>Lignum Nephriticum</hi> and <hi>Mastic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,</hi>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:62336:48"/>
Chips so highly decanted
for the Cure of the Stone. All these
I account only the Shovels; but
the great Pickax was their <hi>Pulvis
Nephriticus Magistralis,</hi> a <hi>Nostrum</hi>
prepared by their Privy Apotheca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and to be purchased of him at
his own rate by the Apothecary in
ordinary. And forasmuch as col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laterally
was intimated to me, this
famed <hi>Pulvis Nephrit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> derived its
vertues chiefly from <hi>Hog-lice,</hi> Egg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shels
calcined, Crabs eyes prepared
with Oyl of Tartar, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But
whether <hi>Cantharides,</hi> or <hi>Spanish</hi>-flies,
did constitute any part of the
<hi>basis</hi> of this mighty Pouder, I could
yet never learn; a particularity
worthy to be enquired into. A
Dram and half of this <hi>Pulvis</hi> was
ordered for a Dose on the 19th of
<hi>December,</hi> as you may read before
among the Prescripts, and to be
swallowed down once or twice a
day in <hi>Rhenish</hi> Wine. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the passages, through which
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:62336:48"/>
the Stone was to come, should be
made big enough, wide enough,
and slippery enough, a Draught
writ down on the 17th of <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi>
of Oyl of sweet Almonds,
Syrup of Marshmallows, and of
the five opening Roots, was to be
given a little before; besides, lest
the Stone should stick in the way,
a <hi>Therebinthin</hi> Glyster was to bring
up the rear, to force it on. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
all this bustle, his Lordships
Urine came tumbling down in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taracts,
but no Stone. At length
the Doctors begin to discover red
Gravel, of which they reported,
they had saved near upon one
Spoonful and an half; but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
it so exactly resembled that
sort of red Sand, which is contain'd
in the <hi>German</hi> Hour-glasses, scarce
any body could look upon it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
smiling. The Gravel descending
was interpreted by them to be the
<hi>Prodromus</hi> of the Stone, which now
they expected every minute, with
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:62336:49"/>
as much Faith, as the <hi>Iews</hi> do their
<hi>Messias,</hi> after a great Storm. And
what is more, one of them like a
<hi>Bigot</hi> Midwife, sate up a Night
or two, to assist at this Rocky
birth.</p>
            <p n="64">§ 64. They push on still, and
adde new forces to their <hi>Stone-breakers,</hi>
and <hi>Piss-driving</hi> Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines,
by ordering twenty drops
of <hi>Spirit of Therebinthin</hi> (a strong
Piss-driver) to be mixt with the
Syrups forementioned, and washt
down with a draught of <hi>Rhenish</hi>-Wine,
this to be repeated after six
hours: no Stone yet, but Urine
in abundance; whence they sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised,
that since the passages were
so well lubricated, the Stone must
stick fast in the <hi>Pelvis</hi> of the Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys;
to loosen which, a Vomit
was commanded to be used on the
24th of <hi>Decemb.</hi> as their Bill ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth;
and on the 25th and
28th, a Purge. From the concus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the Vomit in its operation,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:62336:49"/>
and the compression of the Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culs
of the Belly upon going
to Stool, it was expected the
Stone would be shaken, and tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
down. But in fine, they
were greatly mistaken in their
measures; instead of the Stone,
there was a flood of Urine (impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
so called) came down so
impetuously, that this Patient,
or Physicians Martyr (as his
Lordship was oft pleased to term
himself) in twenty four hours
made six times more water than
he drank, according as my self,
and Chirurgeon several times
found upon an exact computati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by measure: For in a Nights
time twelve, and sometimes thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
Pints of water, were discharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Bladder; which I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
denominate Urine, as not
having the Colour, Scent, or
Tast of such; but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
lookt like rock-water, tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sparent,
and clear, without sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:62336:50"/>
scented like Beef-broath,
and tasted sweetish like Honey.
Here, from making little or no U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine,
observe well, sourced a most
plentiful spring or fountain of clear
water. <hi>Now all hands at work, if
you are men, Luff, no near.</hi> To
stopping the leak they go; and in
order to that, on the <hi>29th</hi> of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember</hi>
appoint an Adstringent
stopping Electuary; likewise a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
binding Decoction of <hi>Comfrey,
Yarrow,</hi> &amp;c. On the <hi>30th</hi> a thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Powder of <hi>Gum-Arabick,</hi> and
<hi>Gum-Dragant,</hi> with a Distillation of
<hi>Cypress-tops, Whites of Eggs, Cinna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
and Milk:</hi> Upon this a mixture
of <hi>Rhubarb, Gum Arabic, Dragant</hi>
and <hi>Confrey-roots,</hi> an unpleasant
sort of <hi>Tansey.</hi> More yet, there must
be also plentifully drunk <hi>Almond</hi>-Milk
with <hi>Poppey</hi>-seeds in it, and
Cordials, and all this in one day. On
the <hi>31th</hi> in the morning they made
their Visit, and spake to the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
attending; Well, what chear,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:62336:50"/>
Nurse? <hi>O, Mr. Doctor, abundance
of Vrine this night! Pain and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
so insufferably violent, that
his Lordship flung himself twice out
of Bed, as if he had Convulsions! His
burning Heat so great, that all night
long my Lord held his hands on bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles
of cold water! Fainted several
times, that I thought he would not
have seen the Morning! Vomited
and strained very oft, as if his eye-strings
would have broke! My Lord
drew his breath so extremely short
and thick, that I verily believed,
he would have been stifled; for his
Lordship would not suffer any Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
to be drawn, or any body stand
near the bed-side, lest he should hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the air from him!</hi> Now,
Mr. Doctor, <hi>Quomodo pulvis?</hi> No
doubt, but the Nephritic <hi>Pulvis</hi>
was a most excellent Powder; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
did Medicine answer expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
better; for perfectly did it
remove the suppression of Urine,
and if Stone or Gravel had been in
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:62336:51"/>
the way, it could never have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
the force of it. Therefore,
<hi>Let's conclude, one and all, They
did what men could do!</hi> Here was
no want, but abundance of Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
and it was ten to one, if one
of them did not hit. He that
throwes with ten Dice, cannot
easily miss <hi>quater trey,</hi> unless he
be <hi>cursedly</hi> unfortunate; and Sea-men
in a Storm do oft hoist up all
their Sails, though they bring the
Mainmast by the board.</p>
            <p n="69">§ 69. Well, <hi>Contra vim mortis
non est Medicamen in hortis.</hi> After
the <hi>Consult-Masse</hi> was ended, my
Lord's Relation askt them, <hi>What
think ye of my Lord? what hopes
have ye?</hi> they replyed (as I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed)
one and all, We have no
manner of hopes, he is a dead man;
we will do what we can to give
him ease. They all gave him over;
and to all those Noblemen that
were Visiters, they declared posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively,
that his Lordship could not
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:62336:51"/>
live; and some went so far, that
they expressed it was impossible, he
should outlive seven days. This
desperate Decree of the Doctors
was soon conveyed to my Lord's
ears by a messenger, that seldome
tarried long by the way to carry
news of this nature to him.</p>
            <p n="70">§ 70. His Lordship no whit dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid
at the ill-tidings, about the
second or third of <hi>Ianuary</hi> desired
I should attend him. My Lord
was then pleased to signifie, that
my absence from the Town on the
day he received his Wounds, had
occasioned him to make use of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
vogued Physicians, whose
greatness of fame since he perceived
to be a vulgar opinion, by the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
that attended their experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
upon him, he frequently
pressed them to consult with me,
as having had a greater experience
of his Constitution upon various
occasions, that did not only require
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:62336:52"/>
competent Learning and Judgment,
but a careful attendance. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation
this sort of discourse
raised on their <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> caused
them to burst into this peremptory
answer, that they would not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult
with me, let the event be what
it would, <hi>because I was not of the
College,</hi> and if his Lordship per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
in those demands, they would
certainly desert him. This reply
being thoroughly perused, my Lord
was obliged to surrender himself
to their discretion, partly through
the necessity of pleasing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> some of
his Relations, and partly through
the new assurances they confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
gave him of a speedy and perfect
Recovery. Since therefore now
he found their hopes turned into
despair, he had easily obtained
from them, what by no manner of
arguments he could dispose them
to before; and in consequence of
that, did appoint me to give them
a Consult-meeting on the morning
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:62336:52"/>
following. In order hereunto, I
examined the Symptomes prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
and those present, which
chiefly were insufferable Pains and
Tortures on the left side of the
lower part of the Belly, too horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for any man of ordinary strength
to endure. 2. A scorching <hi>Hectic</hi>
Fever, that had so macerated his
Body, that it was a perfect repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentative
of a <hi>Skeleton,</hi> covered
over with a skin. 3. A <hi>Diabetes,</hi> in
the dialect of some borish Physici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
called a <hi>Pisspot-dropsie,</hi> a Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptome
so rare, that among ten
millions of sick persons, scarce one
is observed to be afflicted with:
For it is seldome in the power of
the worst of Morbisick Causes to
produce it, unless assisted with the
<hi>Pickaxes</hi> and <hi>Shovels</hi> of the Art of
Physick. 4. <hi>Syncopees,</hi> or long
deep Swoonings, several in a day,
and frequent <hi>Lipothymies,</hi> or fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings.
5. A suffocative Respira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or stifling breathing; as for
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:62336:53"/>
want of sleep, a very low ebbe of
Strength, Vomitings, a dejected Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite,
and worse Concoction, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
I account as nothing, in comparison
of these five.</p>
            <p n="70">§ 70. Death usually being the
termination of each of these Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms,
even when singly afflicting
the Body, moved this Query in me,
Which of all these five mortal Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
would in the most appearance
kill his Lordship first? Upon some
discussion, my opinion inferred,
that the <hi>Diabetes</hi> would absolve its
fatal course the soonest, probably
in eleven days; but then that each
of the other four <hi>Symptomes</hi> might
very well pretend to one days mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief,
seemed conjectural enough,
which substracted from the foresaid
eleven, inferred a consequence,
that his Lordship would not out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live
seven days, as some of the
Doctors had prognosticated.</p>
            <p>How little such a Tragic Scene
of Morbisic Attendants could en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:62336:53"/>
a person to act jointly with
those, that after so many brutal ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies
and affronts, now seemed
only to admit of a Consultation to
make use of me, like the Fox of
the Cats foot, was evident; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
the obligation I owed to my
Lord, and some of his Lordships
own Relations, engaged me to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
the utmost of my endeavors,
especially upon the general noise of
their <hi>Conclamatum</hi> of his Life, and
the observation of many particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
wherein I apprehended they
had egregiously erred.</p>
            <p>By appearing somewhat later
than the hour appointed, it was
supposed my stomach was taken
off by the reflections the Doctors
had made the night before, (for I
was not yet of the College) who
therefore knowing where I was
that Morning, now pressed ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
I should be sent for; not so
much to consult, as to hale me in
to bear part of the burthen. Being
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:62336:54"/>
come to the famous Consult-room,
I found two men, one much of the
<hi>Meen</hi> of some Renegado-Divine, or
School-master turn'd to Physick,
vested and tunickt with black;
the other Campagne Tunickt with
gray, smoaking a Pipe of Tobacco
<hi>al' Indiano.</hi> Whatever they seem'd
to me in the external, the Physical
Eloquence of the former, expressed
by a tongue so nimble, that my
ears could hardly keep pace with
him, and the solid judgment of the
latter, did demonstrate them most
excellent Physicians in the general;
and in particular, the one hath me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited,
among the Vulgar, the fame
of a good Childrens Doctor, and
the other of a Womans Doctor.</p>
            <p>The Prologue of these Physicians
was, that they were come thither
to hear, what Proposal I had to
offer, in order to my Lords Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.
A greater impertinency I
have not heard; implying, as if
they had looked upon themselves to
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:62336:54"/>
be appointed Commissioners to
receive Proposals from me, touching
some kinde of improbable work,
as the draining of a River, or the
like; and to be Judges of <hi>Oyer</hi> and
<hi>Terminer</hi> of the feasibility of the
Project. Thus we see how arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
some sort of men are, when
finding themselves buoyed up by
common fame, Coach and Horses,
and Propt with the dubious inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
of a Law, studying <hi>Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus
viis &amp; modis</hi> to oppress their
equals.</p>
            <p n="71">§ 71. The Replication I made
'em was, that according to the
form of Consultations, I expected
an account of what course and
method had been used, what Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
and against what Diseases,
Causes, or Symptomes; which
done, I should shew<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> my self ready
in declaring my Sentiment. Upon
this, the well-spoken Gentleman re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
the nature of the Wound, and
by what means cured; withal, that
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:62336:55"/>
there were other Distempers sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened
upon that, <hi>viz.</hi> Colick,
Scorbutic pains, Stone and Gravel;
the latter of which he offer'd to
prove, by having caused the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
of a great heap of Gravel,
through the force of those Stone-breaking
and Piss-driving Medicines
that were exhibited, adding the
hereditary property of the Stone,
whereof his Lordship's Father
died. The other Physician was
upon the carping auscultation, to
which his <hi>continuando</hi> of the <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginian</hi>
smoak contributed, by its
<hi>Henbane</hi> quality of condensing of
his animal Spirits.</p>
            <p n="72">§ 72. By passing over all what
they had acted, and the reflections
thereon, I endeavoured to avoid
Disputes and Provocations, and
thought to have contracted an ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and well understanding among
them, which is very necessary to
render Consultations successful;
and therefore immediately exprest
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:62336:55"/>
my sense, That in all Wounds, the
termination of the Cause wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
be it Sword, Lance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
ought to be particularly observed;
and for that reason, the Sword
wherewith his Lordship was woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
was to be exactly traced in its
passage; which considering the
prick, that my Lord very sensibly
perceived a little above the left
Groin, and caused him to fall down,
was an argument the Sword termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
or stopt upon the <hi>Os Coxen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dix</hi>
or <hi>Ischion,</hi> a little above the
<hi>Acetabulum;</hi> if so, then probably
the Sword must have passed the
<hi>Mesentery,</hi> part of the <hi>Psoas,</hi> and
the <hi>Musculus Iliacus internus.</hi> The
ausculting Physician interrupted
me, in saying, that there was no
such Muscul as the <hi>Musculus Iliacus</hi>
belonging to the frame of Mans
Body; and that I was under a great
mistake, it was an errour; and far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
it was ignorance in me; and
therefore I ought to consider well
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:62336:56"/>
of what I said before such men as
they were. At that time having
no Anatomical Picture-Book by
me, nor the occasion of shewing
them the Muscul in a dead Body,
I swallowed the affront, for the
reason expressed in the beginning
of this Paragraph, and proceeded,
intimating that here might very
rationally be suspected, that there
was some small proportion of puru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
matter collected in the hollow
of the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> converted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
such, out of Blood leaking
through some small Vessels, that
were hurt by the passing of the
Sword. But this did not seem a
cause sufficiently adequated to
produce those acute Pains above
the Groin, which therefore I posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
asserted, could be occasioned
by no other than the Puncture of
one of those great Nerves, that are
originated from the <hi>Medulla Spina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis</hi>
about the <hi>Lumbi,</hi> whence issuing
a Gleet, which by Stagnation is
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:62336:56"/>
soon converted into a <hi>Virus,</hi> or
Venom, the property whereof is
not only to cause horrible pains of
the Nerves and Nervous Parts,
but Syncopees, Lipothymies, Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitings,
short oppressed breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
Convulsions, Fevers; but
never a suppression of Urine, nor
<hi>Diabetes:</hi> Whence these two latter
are to be derived, ask the Doctors,
and consult their Prescriptions.</p>
            <p>To prove that those fore-menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
Symptomes did only issue
from the puncture of a Nerve, I
instanced the concomitants and
accidents, that usually attend and
follow a puncture of a Tendon, or
which is much worse, of a Nerve
in the Arm, upon unskilful Blee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings;
<hi>viz.</hi> extreme Pains, Imposthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations,
Syncopees, and the rest.</p>
            <p>The Indications are two. 1. To
stop the Gleet of the Nerve. 2. To
remove the virulent humour, or
liquor, that's already gleeted. By
answering the first indication readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:62336:57"/>
and in due time, the latter is
prevented. But in his Lordships
case there were more Indications to
be desumed from Diseases, that
were constituted, <hi>per Deuteropathi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am,
per errorem externum,</hi> and by
<hi>occasional causes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I cannot here omit, once more
to declare the excellency of our
Balsam, described before, how
speedily it would have performed
in the beginning, what both the
Indications point at; and in many
other Distempers its effects are no
less admirable. But nothing is
more to be regretted, than the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of the <hi>Royal Vulnerary
Drops,</hi> especially being offer'd so
seasonably; which as far as I can
understand, were never yet taken
for the cure of the most dangerous
of Wounds, without having cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
performed the effect, that
was expected from them. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
I do believe, that far meaner
Medicines might have stopt the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:62336:57"/>
Gleet, as Spirit of Vitriol dulci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
Spirit of Sulphur, or <hi>Vitrio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum
Martis,</hi> or what is more ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,
common Vitriol tied up in a
rag, and applied externally, near
the place where the puncture was,
or further off; so diffusive and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrative
is the nature of Vitriol.</p>
            <p>It was not in the beginning, but
at the latter end, that I was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted;
and therefore besides the
former, other Indications are to be
taken, as well from the Diseases the
Sword had occasioned, as those
which Art had procured, viz. <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>betes,</hi>
Fever, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I soon percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
that nothing but a <hi>Mercurial</hi>
Remedy would answer all Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations;
but lest the well-spoken
Doctor should thence take an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to bespatter me, and cry out
aloud, I offered to give his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
<hi>Mercury,</hi> (a word that sounds
barbarous among the ignorant.) I
apprehended it prudence to defer
it, until another might be called in,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:62336:58"/>
or that I had prepared his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
or some of his Relations for
it. In the mean time I proposed
this following, as answering most
of the Indications, as affairs stood
then.</p>

            <p>You may remember, I mentioned
two Physicians that were to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted
that Morning, before this
was prescribed; but one of them
being thrown out for a wrangler, I
was yoaked to the other; who did
as readily reform, and conform, or
indeed take up any form, as any
man I ever met with; though at
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:62336:58"/>
the same time he did also expect
to be indulged in several of his
own Enthusiasms, which resting too
much upon the <hi>basis</hi> of some of his
preceding Opinions, caused fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
dissentions and jarrings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
us. And it is a very common
Observation, that where some great
Physicians have taken up a senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and declared it, they will
not recede from it, though they are
convinced they are in the wrong,
and that it will tend to a certain
prejudice of the Patient; because
they will seem to be more than
men, in the impossibility of erring;
but I have more charity, than to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
this worthy Physician was
polluted with any such Principle;
or at least I hope he was not.</p>
            <p>I have somewhat abruptly given
you an account of our first Consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
which now I shall set down
in the total. After I found that
whatever I proposed, was not only
rejected, but render'd in <hi>Ridicule,</hi>
               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:62336:59"/>
and that at so unfit a season, where
a Person of Honours Life lay at
stake; I asked one of them in <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi>
discoursing of the <hi>Diabetes,
Exhibuisti ne bolum armenum con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra
hunc affectum?</hi> He replied, <hi>Non
novi bolum armenum, sed novi qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem
bolum armenam.</hi> Here I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
he rather acted the part of
a School-master, as he had done
that of the <hi>Iliac</hi> Anatomist, than
of a Physician; which made me
conclude, they designed less what
might be advantageous to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient,
than carping, and derision.
Upon that I took my leave, refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
my Fee, because I had done
nothing for it; which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
they greedily accepted,
as if they had laboured hard in
prescribing never a Bill; and so
we left the Patient in a great deal
of Pain and Misery.</p>
            <p>At Night I was sent for again,
where I met one of them alone,
who singly agreed to all what I
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:62336:59"/>
offer'd, but for formality desired,
to defer prescribing until the other
<hi>Iliac</hi> Physician should be present,
which would not be until the next
morning; and so we left the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
again as we found him. But
it hapned before I went away, that
a very eminent <hi>English</hi> Surgeon
came thither, to give his opinion
touching his Lordships condition,
which imported, that either some
Tendon, Nerve, or Membrane was
hurt on that side, where the pain
was. This agreeing very near with
what I declared to his Lordship be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
we were appointed to meet the
other Doctors next morning. My
self and the forementioned Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeon,
as we returned home, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed,
that in this case, <hi>Rebus sic
stantibus,</hi> nothing could be more
proper, than a <hi>Mercurial</hi> Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine,
viz. <hi>Mercurius dulcis,</hi> a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
so safe, that it is as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
given to Children against
the Worms, as <hi>Aloes,</hi> or Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seed.
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:62336:60"/>
But I desired him to propose
it, in regard the Physicians would
rather take it from a Chirurgeon,
than a Physician; such is the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
emulation of mankinde!</p>
            <p>On the Morning we met; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
my turn to speak first, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentment
I had of their false re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections
touching the <hi>internal Iliac
Muscul,</hi> and <hi>Bolus Armenus,</hi> oblig'd
me to declare, that before I went
on further, I would make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
who was in the errour; and
to that purpose, here was now
brought an authentic Anatomy-Book,
and a <hi>Pharmacopoea;</hi> in the
latter they might see <hi>Bolus Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>
and in the former the <hi>Muscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus
Iliacus internus.</hi> This was no
sooner expressed, but one of the
Physicians burst out into very scur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilous
language, which without
any further ceremony caused me to
leave the Room, and the Consulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Before I was gone past half
the length of the street, I was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:62336:60"/>
back again; and he that was
the most mutinous dismissed, though
much against my desire.</p>
            <p n="73">§ 73. During the calm, the use of
<hi>Mercuri. Dulcis</hi> was no sooner pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,

            <p>§ We had some controversie about
this Hedg-hog powder, the Doctor
pretending he had done Miracles
with it in the like case of a <hi>Diabe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes;</hi>
which assertion I much su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected,
in regard such a Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
under those circumstances,
was not easily parallel'd. Besides,
all the Authors that I ever read,
and in particular <hi>Fran. Ioel. lib. 6.
sect. 2. q.</hi> 8. recommends it as a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
<hi>Diuretic,</hi> against a total sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
of Urine, and seems to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate,
as if it were more forcible
than Hog-lice. Likewise <hi>Forestus
l.</hi> 21. 15. extols it for moving of
Urine and Stool. How could this
then be proper to put a stop to a
Pissing Disease, that so potently
moved Urine? However he would
have it used, because his experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
had supplied him with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Examples. Neither could we
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:62336:61"/>
well accord upon his <hi>Syrupus Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>samicus
ruber,</hi> which according to
my information was a dissolution of
<hi>Gummi Guaiaci</hi> in Spirit of Wine,
and sweetned into a Syrup with
white Sugar. This Medicine I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
against, as being a violent
Purgative, and Diuretic, and a
great fretter of the Blood. The
argument he valued little, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
his own experience; so that
I was forced through importunity
to yield to it. Though in the
whole I found this was grounded
upon the remains of his former opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of his Lordship's being trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
with the Stone and Scurvey.
So opiniatre are some men, when
they fasten to a Disease.</p>
            <p n="75">§ 75. It was his Lordsh. commands,
that since he had taken a new Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine,
prescribed him on Indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
different from those of his
former Physicians, I should watch
with him; by which means I had
occasion more particularly to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:62336:62"/>
the manner of his Pains,
making of Urine, Vomiting, Brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
and Fainting. About eleven
of the Clock at Night his Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptomes
grew very violent, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that he called very earnestly
for his <hi>Hypnotic,</hi> or sleeping Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
I told his Lordship, I could
by no means consent to it, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
it would six those virulent hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
weaken his Brain and
Nerves, and that it was wholly
disagreeing with the Medicine he
had taken in the Morning. A day
or two after, My Lord related to
me, that his other Physicians had
given it him two and thirty Nights
together, and therefore wondered
I scrupled so much at it. You are
to observe, that this ordinary <hi>Hyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notic</hi>
was seldome prescribed, but
order'd by word of mouth; For
it's very rare, that <hi>Opiates</hi> are given
in that proportion, and for so long
a continuance; so that it was not
convenient to have those Bills filed
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:62336:62"/>
in an <hi>Apothecaries</hi> shop, <hi>in perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuam

            <p n="76">§ 76. On the Morning following
the Night I sate up, I gave his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
assurance of removing his pains
very suddenly, by Remedies, that
nights observation had indicated;
but desired the application might
be deferred, for an hour or two,
until the <hi>English</hi> Surgeon (a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of great Knowledge and Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
whose judgment I esteemed
far beyond any of the Physicians)
and the Doctor appeared, to whom
I offer'd the use of <hi>Ventoses,</hi> or
Copping-glasses, to be applyed on
the part affected, to the intent
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:62336:63"/>
those virulent humours that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned
these torments, should be
attracted externally, and so discus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.
The Surgeon well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the effects of <hi>Ventoses,</hi> and
the nature of the Distemper, agreed
immediately they should be applied,
not in the least doubting a good
success; but the Doctor stumbled
at it extremely, and objected elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
against it: I suppose, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it was proposed by me, and
so well approved by the Surgeon.
At length our arguments prevailed
for the <hi>Ventoses:</hi> Upon the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of the first Copping-glass,
his Lordships Pains abated, and
upon the renewing it the second
and third time, his Pains were va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished

the least return for two Months

was on a sudden surprized with a

that it put us out of our road for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
a while; but the <hi>occasional cause</hi>

though it had been given
some days before, and was wrought
off by five or six motions on the

it was to be imputed to
the daily use of the Balsamic Syrup

without any more ado, my self and
the Surgeon desired, that both the

            <p n="84">§ 84. The effect of these Medicines
having reduced the retentive fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
of the Guts to their former
duty, I judged it expedient to
loose no more time, but to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
towards a Cure; and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
it was not improbable, that
in a short interval the Gleet of the
Nerve would by stagnation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>assume
its preceding <hi>virus,</hi> and that
the superfluous Humours of the
body would by nature be thrown
to that part, as being the weakest,
I proposed, that a large <hi>Caustick</hi>
should be applied on the region of
the left <hi>Ilia,</hi> by which means the
channel of the foresaid Humours
would not only be diverted out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
but there would be a vent
given to those virulent evapora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
though their fountain was
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:62336:67"/>
so deeply remote. For it's conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to Experience, that an <hi>Empy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ema</hi>
consisting of matter more gross,
hath been rarified, extracted, and
dryed up, by several <hi>Causticks</hi>
applied to the Breast. This being
new to the other Physic ian, and
because it was recommended by
me, he would by no means assent to
it, and therefore pressed, that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
Physician of the Cabal should
be called, in which particular he
was indulged by my Lords Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
He misunderstanding, that
it was the other Doctor advised
the <hi>Caustick,</hi> therefore immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
approved of it; but the next
Morning perceiving his mistake,
did as obstinately oppose the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of a <hi>Caustick</hi> on the inside
of the Thigh a little below the
Groin, as he had easily yielded to
the former. The Surgeon, whose
Experience and Judgment I estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
beyond twenty of them, gave
me his opinion, that the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:62336:68"/>
could not be used without
success; and therefore after they
were withdrawn to their several
occupations, we caused the foresaid
<hi>Caustick</hi> to be applyed, and three
or four days after we judged it
convenient to apply another on the
inside of the Thigh, a little above
the Knee; the <hi>Escar</hi> being cast off,
we keep them open for a long
time, by putting in several <hi>Ivy</hi>-pease
with a piece of flatted lead
over them, to cause them to make
a deeper impression.</p>

the ordinary Chymical Balsam,

it was the Balsam of Sulphur; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

            <p>On the 16th of <hi>Ianuary</hi> in the
morning, this Physician finding his
Lordship encompassed with Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes
so dangerous, that in his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
he seemed to have computed
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:62336:70"/>
the Hours and Minutes, beyond
which he could not survive, and
therefore peremptorily declared,
that if another Physician of the
Cabal was not called in, he would
come no more; an expedient that
was made use of by him, to draw
his neck out of the collar. I told
him, as he went down the stairs,
he acted not only very ungrateful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
having received so many Fees;
but uncharitably and inhumanely,
in leaving a Person of Honour in
that condition, who now once in
six hours was assailed with a <hi>Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cope,</hi>
that sometimes for the space
of half an hour rendered him in
appearance little different from
dead.</p>
            <p>Conceiving these Convulsions,
and other Symptomes, to be occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned
by those venemous steems,
attacquing the Brain, and the whole
<hi>genus nervosum,</hi> and consequently
the Heart, through that nervous
branch of the Sixth pair that is
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:62336:71"/>
distributed to it, to which the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi>
Surgeon did not only assent,
but likewise offer'd such demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strative
Arguments, that I should
not have expected from any of the
Physicians, moved me to give his
Lordship six, and sometimes eight
drops of my own <hi>Balsam of Sulphur,</hi>
(prepared after a mode not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
in the least) in an ounce of a
Cordial prescribed by me: for now
being left at my own liberty, I
directed such Medicines as I thought
proper to answer the present Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations.
At the second exhibition
the <hi>Syncope</hi> and Convulsions cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.
His Vomiting, which was
caused by consent of the great
<hi>Stomachick</hi> Nerves, and his diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
of Respiration depending on
the affection (by consent) of the
Nerves, that are disseminated
through the <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
very considerably abated.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding the other Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician
judged it prudence to change
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:62336:71"/>
his resolution, and make officious
Visits to his deserted Patient, to
observe the event; and perceiving
that the Symptomes went off so
strangely beyond his expectation,
on the third morning after he had
left us, came into the Consult-chamber
again among us, with
much affability and Eloquence, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
to enter into consultation
with me; but we immediately gave
him the whole Room to walk in by
himself. My Lord enquired the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of our leaving the Doctor; an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
was made, that he had a minde
to come in upon the review, and it
was thought sit, that since he left
his Lordship in extremity, we
ought to leave the Doctor, now the
distemper had a better aspect: But
however as for my own particular,
if his Lordship was pleased to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
me, or if his Honours Relation
would needs have it so, I was very
willing to advise with so learned
and eminent a Physician. My Lord
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:62336:72"/>
waved it, and left himself wholly
to our care.</p>
            <p>By the way, this is a plain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of the result of Consultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and the difference of a Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians
acting singly and freely with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
that disturbance, imploying the
utmost of his care and endeavours
to the advantage of his Patient:
Whereas in Consultations, especially
grand ones, it matters not what the
event is, there being a great many
vouchers and shoulders, to bear the
corps upon; besides, oft-times he
that prates most, leads the rest by
the nose. And to what purpose
should any of them take much
pains? For if the Patient lives,
the reputation of his Cure is equal
to them all, as well to the Fool as
the Knave; their Fee is likewise
equal, he that saith little, hath as
much as he that speaks all: More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
if any of them should prove
refractory, or somewhat mutinous,
be sure the rest would never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:62336:72"/>
with him again; which must
necessarily prove a great loss to
him. For there is abundantly more
money got by Consultations, than
single Practice: Neither <hi>Mayern,
Prudgeon,</hi> nor <hi>Willis</hi> could have
got a quarter of the estate they
left, barring Consultations; more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
it is a safe practice, and no
hazard of a mans Reputation.
Every Physician expects no less
than a double Fee, and for that
each of them will foist in his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine,
which too oft proves to be
such a hodgpot, that it sends the
Patient in a little time to his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors.
<hi>Fernelius, Hollerius, Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retus,</hi>
and <hi>Cardan,</hi> men in their time
of far greater fame than any of
my Lords Physicians, chanced to
be called in Consultation; the one
advised Bleeding, the other a
Julep, the third a Decoction, the
fourth a Cordial <hi>Bolus,</hi> besides ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other Medicines, all to be used
in one day: a great charge this
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:62336:73"/>
must amount to! The Patient was
a Youth troubled with a Headach,
Drouth, Gripes and Fever. The
Physicians were no sooner gone,
but there comes an Old-woman, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended
by a Jesuit, who with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
much consultation anoints his
Belly, especially about the Navil,
with a Liniment of <hi>Ox-gall, Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cynthis,</hi>
and <hi>Aloës,</hi> which in less
than an hour moved a Stool or
two, and brought away five or six
Worms: Upon this the Lad was
immediately restored to his health.
The Physicians returning next
morning to see the Patient, who
was abroad at play, were very ill-received
by the Mother of the Boy,
who called them <hi>Rogues,</hi> that would
have kill'd her Childe by bleeding;
and <hi>Cheats,</hi> for taking her Money
without deserving it.</p>
            <p>Some days before this Doctor
left us, there hapned a long dispute
between me and two of the former
Physicians, who baited me for
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:62336:73"/>
three hours together in a Consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
concerning a purulent eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation,
which I had observed his
Lordship made by Stool. Here
they cavill'd, in objecting, they
saw no passage by which matter
could be transmitted into the Guts.
I told them the passages were not
different from those, through
which Nature in a Dropsie, being
stimulated by a Purge, doth throw
off water, that is collected in the
capacity of the <hi>Abdomen.</hi> Let

               </gap>. Likewise it hath
been many times observed, that in
an <hi>Empyema</hi> the purulent collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
hath been discharged sometimes
by Stool, but more commonly by
Urine, by the matter being admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
into the Vessels, and so by

            <p>It was much about this time,
since affairs went on so successfully,
the Physicians of the Brotherhood
made it their business to disperse
themselves into most of the great
Coffee-houses of the Town, where
they sometimes reported, I was a
Mountebank, sometimes a Surgeon,
and othertimes an Apothecary, or a
Chymist; for what I had done was
meerly by chance. I much wonder,
how many such Mountebanks they
can shew me, that are of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination.
As for my Education, I
question whether I have not had
far better than any of them. The
<hi>Latine</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> Tongues I at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:62336:74"/>
in the <hi>Low-countries;</hi> then
was placed in <hi>Exeter</hi>-College in
<hi>Oxford,</hi> Doctor <hi>Conant</hi> being at
that time Rector, where I studied
Philosophy several years; then
went to <hi>Leyden,</hi> where I had one
<hi>Collegium Theoreticum,</hi> and two
<hi>Collegia Practica</hi> under Professor

under Professor <hi>van Horn,</hi>
and one <hi>Colleg. Botanicum</hi> under
Professor <hi>Vorstius.</hi> I went twice
a week to the Hospital with the
foresaid Professor <hi>vander Linden,</hi>
to learn to know Diseases, when
they came before me, and how to
cure them. I was also instructed
there in the <hi>Chymical</hi> Art by a
<hi>German.</hi> My Lodging was at a
Surgeons house, on purpose to
learn the practical part of Surgery;
once a day I went to an Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caries
shop, kept by a Relation of
my Landlord, where I was taught
the trade of an Apothecary. After
this I passed into <hi>France,</hi> to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:62336:75"/>
my self by visiting the Sick
of the <hi>Charité</hi>-Hospital every day,
for some Moneths together; and
twice a week I went to <hi>l'Hostel
Dieu,</hi> made what Observations I
could, and committed them to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.
Thence I made the <hi>petit
tour,</hi> and in my way I took my
Degrees in Physick, both of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelor
and Doctor. Upon my
return to <hi>Paris,</hi> I made an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
with Monsieur <hi>Iannot</hi> to dress
and assist at the greater Operations
in Surgery, at the forementioned
<hi>Charité</hi>-Hospital: in the intervals
of my Studies I was present at
Monsieur <hi>Gayen</hi> his Anatomies, as
many as hapned to be during my
abode there. I passed also a cours
of <hi>Chymistry</hi> with Monsieur <hi>Barlet.</hi>
Hence I returned into <hi>Holland,</hi>
where I was admitted Fellow of the
College of Physicians at the <hi>Hague,</hi>
as appears by their Dispensatory in
print. After some months I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to <hi>London,</hi> whence I was
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:62336:75"/>
sent to <hi>Flanders,</hi> to be Physician
(or Doctor-General, as they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
phrase it) to the Army,
where I continued till I was tired
of the employment, and then took
my course for <hi>Italy</hi> through <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many;</hi>
passed away some time at
<hi>Padua, Bolonia,</hi> and <hi>Rome;</hi> and
having seen the other chief Cities,
came back through <hi>Switzerland,</hi>
and so down the <hi>Rhine</hi> to <hi>Collen,</hi>
thence into <hi>Holland,</hi> and soon after
into <hi>England,</hi> where I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
ever since, and followed
my Practice. Now how these Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
can make a Mountebank,
Surgeon, Apothecary, or Chymist
of me, without touching their own
Copyhold, I cannot tell: Sure I
am, I was never a Renegado Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,
a Schoolmaster, or Trooper
turn'd to Physick, or ever put the
dice upon them by a forged <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plome</hi>
from <hi>Oxford;</hi> neither am I
a meer <hi>Velvetier,</hi> that hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but the Plush-jacket on his
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:62336:76"/>
Back, to shew what Trade he is of;
neither was I ever Member of a
Society that harboured such, but
scorn to be of it. I never gave
<hi>Mercurius Dulcis</hi> to a Lady against
Fits, that serv'd me such a jades
trick as to <hi>Salivate</hi> her, and put
her in danger of her Life. I never
advised a young Lady very lately
to loose twenty or thirty Ounces of
Blood, upon a spotted Fever, which
kill'd her. I have at no time ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred
<hi>Laudanum Opiatum</hi> so
unskilfully, that Patients never
awaken'd again. I never gave
Vomit or Purge, that kill'd the
Patient in the operation. I have
not prescribed a Purge very lately
to a young Gentleman, whose small
Pox appearing, was mistaken by
the Physician for Heat; which the
next day, when the Purge should
have been taken, were plainly risen
all over the body, and caused the
Doctor to go to Prayers with the
Lady his Mother and the Family, to
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:62336:76"/>
give God thanks the Purge was
not taken, and made his confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that it would have killed him,
had he swallowed it, standing
ready upon the Table for him.
Thus you see Physicians sometimes
tye a Sword over your head by a
hair. Was it not the <hi>Town-Idol,</hi>
that by his Anatomical Craft di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
the place of Incision in a
Childe, whose <hi>Anus</hi> was imperfo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated,
upon the <hi>Sphincter</hi> Muscul,
whereof the Infant soon died, he
having wholy missed the Venthole?
Did he not a considerable time
treat a Lady out of Town, for a
a Rhumatisme of the Shoulder,
which proved a large Imposthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
ready to be opened, and
upon apertion discharged above a
Pint of purulent matter, and so was
suddenly recovered; who other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
by this Rhumatic course might
have lost the use of her Arm, and
possibly of her Life? But enough
of this at present; Only lest they
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:62336:77"/>
should run into an inconvenience
by a mistake of the name, I will
give them this Advertisement, That
there is one <hi>Harvy,</hi> whom the
courtesy of <hi>England</hi> gives the title
of Doctor, he lives somewhere near
<hi>Suffolk-str.</hi> learnt his Trade of

though whether he keeps the Stage,
I cannot inform them. Thus much
for my own vindication.</p>
            <p>The Vulnerary Decoction and
Bags derived their Vertues chiefly
from <hi>Traumatic</hi> Herbs (viz. <hi>Pyrola
Virga aurea, Sanicula,</hi> and some
others) that were gathered on the
<hi>Alpes</hi> of <hi>Switzerland,</hi> and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
dryed, in energy and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
far exceeding ours, which were
presented to me by the Right Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
my Lord <hi>Holles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The form of my Prescriptions
of the Vulneraries, Cordials, and
other Medicines, may be seen on
the Apothecaries file, the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:62336:77"/>
whereof I have omitted,
not only because it would swell
this Treatise into too great a mole,
but chiefly by reason those, that
shall think fit to answer this Tract,
should have some matter to work
on; So that I hope they will as
faithfully transcribe my Bills, as I
have done theirs: For I should
take it very ill, if they should tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
me in that particular. A third
Reason you shall also know in my
Reply.</p>
            <p>My Lord's Diet was chiefly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Broath made of Mutton, Veal,
and Poultry; sometimes with Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerary
Herbs in it, other times
without. I allowed him no Flesh
for a month or six weeks. From
Glysters I disused his Body gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally;
directing at first but one in
two days, then one in a week, at
length wholy omitted them for a
long interval: They were either of
Mutton-broath alone, or of Milk
and Sugar, according as I judged
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:62336:78"/>
requisite. My Balsam of Sulphur
was continued; I directed also
a Vulnerary Decoction; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Vulnerary Bags to be infused
in Eight-shilling Beer, and to be
drunk in his usual Drink; like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
Cordials, and sometimes Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dials
and <hi>Antepileptics</hi> mixt toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>The effect of these Medicines
were such, that in a short space his
Urine appeared in moderate pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions,
of a good laudable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence
and colour, and a healthy
<hi>hypostasis.</hi> Then I thought sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable,
to adde <hi>Comfry</hi>-roots and
<hi>Milfoil</hi> to his other Vulneraries,
to heal and consolidate the pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctured
Nerve. After this his
Lordship went abroad for two
Months, flung off his Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines
too soon, against my advice;
only once in a fortnight I prevail'd
with him to take a <hi>Laxative</hi> of
<hi>Manna</hi> and <hi>Syrup</hi> of <hi>Roses,</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
in Broath. In the interim
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:62336:78"/>
my Lord kept a very ill Diet, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
did eat Coleworts, powder'd
Beef, fresh Cod, Salmon, Tarts,
and the like; dined oft abroad,
where he scarce refused any thing,
that was brought to the Table:
Drank all sorts of Wine, though
moderately; and once beyond o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
times drank sharp <hi>Rhenish</hi>-wine
upon a plentiful Dinner of fresh
Cod, which occasioned a smart
ebullition of his Humours, bursted
open again the Puncture, that was
so lately healed, and procured a
fresh Gleet, so violent, that his
Lordship relapsed into Pains as
great as ever. There was no way
to stop the impetuous current of
this Gleet, and consequently to
remove his Pains, but by giving a
lift to his humours, and turn the
stream upwards; which I perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by raising a Salivation so gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
that his Mouth was scarce sore,
or his Face swelled: his Lordship
did not salivate above a Pint and
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:62336:79"/>
an half in 24 hours, neither was it
continued beyond seven or eight
days. The Salivation was no
sooner raised, but his Pains vanisht
immediately, and in the time of
the Flux recovered his Appetite
and Strength; an observation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to what it useth to effect in
others. However, this was a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrative
Argument <hi>à juvante,</hi>
that his Lordships pains were oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned,
by a venemous Gleet
from a punctur'd Nerve. Upon
this I caused my Lord to take two
or three Sweats, upon a draught of
a Decoction of <hi>Sarsa</hi> with Vulne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries,
in a chair, to sweat out the
remains of the Mineral, and dry up
the superfluities of the <hi>Succus Ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vosus,</hi>
and other humours: After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
continued the same Decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for some time, though not so
long as I did advise. In every
draught of the Decoction were
used ten or twelve Drops of my
<hi>Tincture of Antimony,</hi> which put
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:62336:79"/>
his Lordship into a condition to be
abroad again for several Weeks;
but returning to an irregular Diet,
fell into a plain <hi>Rhumatism, viz.</hi>
smart Pains in his Breast, which
after a short continuance would
remove to his Shoulders, thence to
his Neck and Elbows, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
to his Back; for this I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised
his Lordship to be blooded a
moderate quantity, twice in eight
days, or thereabouts, by which
means this foresaid <hi>Rhumatism</hi>
went very well off. Then I used
all the perswasive Arguments, not
forgetting that of the Pitcher go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so oft to the Well, to observe
Rules strictly, and particularly
those relating to his Diet, which
my Lord thought a Penance so
great (as indeed it would have
been to any man, that had been so
long in a course) that he soon shoke
off all directions, and was again
as irregular in his Diet, or rather
more than before. The effect of
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:62336:80"/>
this proved likewise worse than
formerly; for besides Pains, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
now to observe matter <hi>(pus)</hi>
in my Lord's Urine, about the
quantity of a dram, which by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
increased to the measure of a
spoonful or two, and that of an ill
colour: For deterging, I gave his
Lordship some of my Balsam of
<hi>Sulphur,</hi> likewise another Tincture
of <hi>Antimony,</hi> with directions how
to use it in a Vulnerary Decoction
that was prepared, sometimes with
vulnerary Herbs, boiled in a small
<hi>Aqua Calcis,</hi> and sometimes in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and a little <hi>French</hi>-wine. The
matter by these means soon grew of
a better colour, and well-digested
into a white <hi>pus,</hi> then gradually
diminished, until it came to that
pass, which required consolidation
and healing: To which intent I
gave a Tincture of <hi>Mars</hi> of my own
preparation, which being all used,
as much as I had of it ready pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared,
I was forced to advise <hi>Tun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge</hi>-waters,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:62336:80"/>
having a Vertue not
only to cleanse, and consolidate,
(witness many that have been
cured both of internal and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Ulcers) but to discharge the
malignant Gleet of the Nerve, to
which I ever had a particular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard,
as being the cause of all.
These Mineral-waters were drunk
with so great success in Town,
that I was encouraged to perswade
his Lordship to go to the Wells,
where the waters, by the observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of all people, are found much
more effectual: But it hapned,
that the rockiness of the ways
thither had so disturbed those ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
parts (which might have been
prevented by a Litter; but that my
Lord would by no arguments yield
unto) that it threw him into his
pains, which so put us out of our
course, that it was not in the power
of Art to recover our point again;
neither did his Lordship drink the
Waters more than once; which he
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:62336:81"/>
should not have done, had I been
present. Being returned to Town,
the Ulcer recruded again, and
discharged matter, sometimes for
eight or ten days, until what was
engender'd was quite drain'd; then
there was an intermission of the
discharge, until there was a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
quantity regendred, which
would then again be cast off by
Urine.</p>
            <p>At length there was so great a
Debilitation of the Nerves and
Brain, occasioned by the frequent
return of the Pains, and regurgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of the venemous Gleet, that
it oft-times cast the Patient into
<hi>Cataleptic</hi> Fits, which by internal
Medicines, the application of <hi>Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toses</hi>
and <hi>Epispasticks,</hi> I did more
than once bring his Lordship off,
beyond the expectation of all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.
His Body being dayly more
and more macerated, his Spirits
diminishing, and Strength extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
impairing, God Almighty was
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:62336:81"/>
pleased to deliver him of all his
miseries, on <hi>Michaelmass</hi>-day in
the morning, about seven of the
Clock.</p>
            <p>His Lordships Body was opened
two days after by command of the
Coroners Jury, who ought to have
understood, it was my business
(who had attended this Noble Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
three quarters of a year, and
in all probability knew best, where
to discover the Cause (the <hi>occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal</hi>
of his Death) by directing the
Surgeon, Monsieur <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster-Surgeon
of <hi>Paris,</hi> and of the
Hall in <hi>London,</hi> that likewise at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
last) in the Dissection: But
it was so managed, that the other
Physicians and Surgeons had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signedly
so pallisado'd themselves
about the table, that I had only
room to peep through, to observe
the hand of the dissecting Surgeon,
that he might not drop in a Pebble
into the hollow of the Kidney, to
palliate the reputation of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters.
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:62336:82"/>
After they had left the
Room, I returned to make a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower
search than they had done,
there being also present two Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
of Physick, not of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege,
who were both very expert
Anatomists. Here I found all his
Intrails sound, not the least Stone
or Gravel in the Kidneys; but the
<hi>Psoas</hi> Muscul, on the left side, was
<hi>gangren'd,</hi> and part of the <hi>Colon,</hi>
both being turn'd black, though
not <hi>sphacelated:</hi> for in a <hi>Sphacelus,</hi>
which is a perfect Mortification,
the part is so rotted, that it will
scarce hang together, and is usually
attended with a stink; whereas a
<hi>Gangrene</hi> is only a tendency to, or
the beginning of a <hi>Sphacelus.</hi> I
likewise observed, that the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
Muscul, comparing it with the
Muscul of the other side, was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minisht
one third part, being cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roded
away, and turned into mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
that was engendred through
the Ebullition, or in their sense
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:62336:82"/>
Fermentation of the malign Gleet
and the Blood, which being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>to the Veins, was by Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation
carried to the Emulgents
and Kidneys, and thence with the
Urine to the Bladder, in the same
manner as I have already mention'd
before. So that here in this part
was the Ulcer, where no matter
was found at that time; because it
had been drained and carried off
before, his Lordship not having
discharged any matter five or six
days before his Death. Moreover,
pressing hard with my Fingers up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the said <hi>Psoas</hi> Muscul, that was
so extremely wasted, I felt those
great branches of Nerves of the first
and third Lumbal Conjugations
(whose anterior branches are disse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated
through its body) like a
cord, rigidly contracted, and knot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
throughout, a true signe the
Puncture was in one of those
Nerves, neither was any other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident
capable to produce all these
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:62336:83"/>
and the other Symptomes; so that
it was no wonder, if upon contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the Nerves, his Lordship's
left Leg was contracted shorter than
the right. His difficulty of breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
was beyond all dispute occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned
by consent of a branch of
the first <hi>Lumbal</hi> pair of Nerves,
that is distributed through the
carnous part of the <hi>Diaphragm;</hi>
likewise his Gripes by consent of
those other branches of Nerves,
that excur to the Guts. The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
tumor on the left <hi>Ilia</hi> was
only a tension of the Membranes.
In Conclusion, I will presume to
offer these Queries. 1. Whether
I ever receded from the opinion I
first stated, or from the Indications
I first desumed. 2. Whether it be
not probable, had I acted as vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
as others have done, these
great Physicians would have
judged <hi>Oribasius de Laqueis</hi> a fitter
author for me to read than <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates.</hi>
3. Whether a good old
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:62336:83"/>
Surgeress in the Country might
not in the beginning have been
more successful with a Poultess of
a few green Herbs on the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
and the good <hi>Allom</hi> Posset.
4. If the method that was followed
by me, had been used at the time,
when they began to give his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
<hi>Opium,</hi> and before they had
made use of their Pickaxes and
Shovels, whether in all probability
the success would not have been
different. 5. Whether it was not
as ridiculous as malicious, in some
of these Physicians, to report, that
two or three small Doses of <hi>Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius
Dulcis,</hi> (whereof Children of
three or four years old have taken
six or seven Doses with great suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
against the Worms) and those
consented unto by the chief of 'em,
as appears by his Mark set to the
Prescription, should have done his
Lordship the least injury, having
been given at least Six or Seven
Months before. I have no more to
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:62336:84"/>
say at present, but, From grand
Consultations in Physick, <hi>Liberae
nos Domine.</hi>
