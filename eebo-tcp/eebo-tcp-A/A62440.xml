            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Whether those you call ignorant persons, especially Mr. <hi>Odowd,</hi> (whom 'tis confessed I did sometime meet with upon a very reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and justifiable account) be guilty of those Crimes that are laid to their charge, (malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously as I conceive in great part, and upon false grounds) I shall not undertake to venti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late or discuss, let them plead and vindicate themselves. However, grant them and my self never so bad as you say. Yet Truth is Truth, and will stand firm in despite of all your undermining, cryptick, and subterranean workings, to blow up the Propugnators and Defenders of it. I desire to appeal to all so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, discreet, honest, and impartial men that know me <hi>intus &amp; in cute,</hi> whether I ever pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed or joyned with any to carry on any base unworthy thing in this Chymical Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise, above the Glory of God, the increase of Vertuous Actions, the Honour of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,

                  <p>As for that intimate friendship between me and Mr. <hi>Odowd</hi> (which your Halophant di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulges) it is as arrant a Truth as that you are real friends to Chymistry, unless it be <hi>per An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiphrasin.</hi> Indeed I alwayes looked upon the Gentleman as a queint Courtier endued with good natural parts, and might deserve well of his King and Countrey, according to his sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, without justifying his Illiterature, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing withal that were true (which I former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly much suspected) that he had acquired so potent and active an <hi>Arcanum</hi> as he relates, and some do now testifie, above any Weak and sluggish Preparation in your Dispensato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: To your grand shame be it spoken, that such an Illiterate person, (for which Defect I have heard him sometimes ingenuously con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dole himself in the presence of several know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men) should outvie your learned Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in that which is principally desired by every Sick man; but I never had that favour

From that time there came to me a Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Note of Mr. <hi>Rawlinsons</hi> Cure, signed with his own hand, I began to think better of him then before, and conceited the Devil was not so black as some that painted him.

                  <head>An Epistolar Discourse to the Learned and Deserving Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of <hi>Galeno-pale.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>AFter my most real and hearty thanks, for that great favour you were pleased to oblige me with, in bestowing upon me that Learned, Useful, and Seasonable Piece of yours, <hi>Galeno-pale,</hi> (in acknowledgement of which obligation, be pleased to accept the tender of my utmost service, and most cordial love) I make bold in answer of your request so me, to return you my sense of that Tractate of yours, (which is so highly deserving, as not to need my Commendation, and so accurately learned, as not to fear any mans Censure or Animadversion) as also of that trivial and contemptible piece of Garrulity, pretended as an Animadversory Reply to your Book, and Lash for your person; though in my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he hath had the ill luck, to be so far out
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:40704:20"/>
in the performance, that his ill cookt mess of opprobrious Obloquy, will serve onely to polish, and make more amiable the lustre of that your excellent Tractate; and like a black foil, to set out to the greater advantage, that so every way desirable Jewel.</p>
                  <p>Of my concurrence with you in opinion, my two Tractates, <hi>viz. Helmonts Vindication,</hi> and <hi>Pyrotechny Asserted,</hi> are such undeniable arguments, that I need adde nothing in this place for confirmation of a truth so beyond doubt, apparently evident. To them I referre such as either know not, or will not believe, that I am altogether concurring with you in Judgement; being able to prove beyond ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional contradiction, that our Opinions here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in agree with the truth of Nature; and can practically demonstrate, that our Antagonists, in what they differ from us, have onely idle Speculations, and unprofitable airy Notions, which they embrace instead of real practical truths; so hugging (as the Poet hath it) a Cloud instead of <hi>Juno.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is not because we are strangers to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Humours, that we do not, with the <hi>Galenists,</hi> make up Temperaments, and vary Complexions and Constitutions, according to the divers mixtures of them, and measure all
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:40704:20"/>
the defects in Nature, by their contest, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valency and victory. What the received opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion herein is, we know, and learned many years since; but afterward, being convincing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reclaimed by the unresistable force of light and truth, we learned that hard lesson, of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king loss of all these imaginary attainments, and were willing to confess that we had drunk largely of muddy and unwholesom waters; and being thus overswayed with the Dictates of a more sound Reason, we accounted it no dishonour both to sing a <hi>Palinode</hi> our selves, and sound a Retreat unto others; desiring if it were the good will of God, that as many as are friends to Learning and pretend to inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity, may taste of the pure streams of truth, and solid learning; not doubting but if once tasted, they would drink largely, and alwayes desire the same Waters, loathing those muddy and infected lakes to which they had been long accustomed.</p>
                  <p>While we resolved on this course, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressed our selves in earnest to this work of Charity, of recovering as many as we could (all if possible) from the paths of Errour, in which they (following either blinde or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful guids) had long wandred: As we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally did a work of pious Charity towards all,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:40704:21"/>
so our pains and labour was candidly interpret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and acknowledged by some, who by the help of that small Candle which we (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our mean capacity) had lighted up, and brought with us, did discover such monstrous Deformities and Defects in that Fabrick in which they were, and for want of a clear di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Light, esteemed a sumptuous and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Building; they discovered, I say, such rotten Foundations, ruinous Arches and Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, mouldering and tottering Walls, a leaky and almost falling Roof, that they were quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prevailed with to quit that dangerous, and most unpleasant abode, fit onely to make a ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation for Birds of darkness.</p>
                  <p>But alas! as there is no action (of what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment soever) that will universally please, so this work of ours, which by many was, and by all deserves to be attributed to pious Charity, was misinterpreted, reproached, and reviled by many, and those men of no mean rank or fame. For this old, decayed, rotten Structure, of which I speak, is challenged by some of the Antients of the Fraternity, as a Propriety belonging to the Professors of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy and Physick; of which they as Seni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors are to have the mannagement and dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing. These to the younger deal out Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:40704:21"/>
and Tenements, as also Honours and ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tular Preferments, with this caution, that they shall admit them and no other, to be their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours, Guids, Directors, and Counsellors: and because the Building was once famous and stately, though now decayed and ruinous, they dawb over these Defects with Plaistering and Painting, and adorn the Walls and Arches with curious Hangings, but will not indure any clear Light to be brought in to discover their crazie and tottering Habitation, lest their Guests and Candidates being affrighted at the discovery, should leave them; and so the repute they have, of being the Fathers and Dispensers of Art and Knowledge, should vanish like a shadow before the Sun.</p>
                  <p>These are they that are ever learning, but never come to the Knowledge of truth; and the reason is, because they think they have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready attained it, and therefore conceive there is no need of further learning, and disdain to be taught, or reproved, but will abuse him that shall attempt it, and load him with op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probrious contumelies.</p>
                  <p>On which score it was, Sir, that the late invective against your person (and in your name all that are assertors of Pyrotechny its excellency, beyond the Art or Mystery of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:40704:22"/>
professed by those who style them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves <hi>Methodists,</hi> as by a Characteristical note of Distinction) was vomited up under colour of Animadversions upon your deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly esteemed Tractate, with a Title befit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Author (appearingly at least) of that infamous Libel; which were I in your case I would scorn to Answer, but in such a way as might manifest deserved contempt and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, not of he Author (pretended) had he been (which he can hardly) more inconsiderable then he is, but of the sheets which he hath blotted, not with any design, (if he have but the wit to survey the Lines he hath fathered with any discretion) but to let the world know, what a pitiful Reply the Rational Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists of <hi>Amen-Corner</hi> can make to the just Exceptions of the true Sons of Art, against their pretended <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which to English in their sense, is onely a bare subscription to <hi>Galen;</hi> on which score they are severely cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable, but deserve pity (to speak the most soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) for that unlawful Marriage, which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out consent of both parties, they have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to make between solid Realities and practical Verities, on the one part, and aerial Speculations, mistaken Principles of Nature, and ignorant Conclusions, and Prescriptions
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:40704:22"/>
taken on trust from their predecessors, without examination, on the other part; which Marriage if they can consummate, so as to produce from it a <hi>Galeno-Chemical</hi> off-spring, I hope they will reconcile lazie Ignorance, with sedulous Diligence and Industry, in searching out truth, for Bride-men; and Light and Darkness, Truth and Error, adept Knowledge, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taticious Uncertainty, for Bride-maids; and let all about Town that have skill in the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Languages, Logick, and School Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, and have read <hi>Galen</hi> and <hi>Paracelsus, Avi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cen</hi> and <hi>Helmont, Riverius</hi> and <hi>Quercetan,</hi> the <hi>London Dispensatory,</hi> and <hi>Scroderus Pharma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copoea,</hi> &amp;c. be Candidates of this new Society; and let the Author of those sorry <hi>Animadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions</hi> on your Book, be Door-keeper to this new-model'd Colledge, with order that he admit of none, that is a verier Wise-man then himself, as a Member among them; and then no doubt but the Art of Medicine will be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, so as to silence the wonder of a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notaure, or the Poets <hi>Pegasus,</hi> or a Syren.</p>
                  <p>But, Sir, I hope as you in your <hi>Galeno-pale</hi> have begun to forbid the Banes, and to put a stop to the Enterprize of so unequal a Match, and have shown most just Causes why two Parties so disagreeing should not be joyned
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:40704:23"/>
in Matrimony; so you will continue a vigilant Eye that the <hi>Galenical Satyr,</hi> whose Lust of propagating (whether in, or out of Kinde) is insatiable, may not commit a Rape upon so delicate a Nymph as <hi>Pyrotechny;</hi> such an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful mixture is by some reputed and report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the original of Apes, Monkeys, and Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boons; if or no, truly, I shall not dispute, but surely the unequal commixture before mentioned, will in likelihood, yea for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, produce as great, or greater Monsters in Art, then the others are in Nature, allowing the supposition of their original for true.</p>
                  <p>'Tis granted, of late many rash pretenders have assumed the Title of Chemists, whom Nature not knowing, nor they her, the true Sons of Art disdain to own, and protest a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst; among whose number I know none more fit to be first begun withal, then this Fugitive Renegado, who never attaining high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er honour in the Chemical Army, then of a Pioneer, or Dragoon at best, hath proved an Apostate from that Profession he never was worthy of, and betrayed to the Enemy as much as he ever knew, which all that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand any thing in Art, are assured, is little enough; by discovery of which no real Artist need fear dammage, nor was there ground of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:40704:23"/>
Reply to any thing that either hath dropt, or heréafter may fall from his Pen, were it not that all who know him are induced to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that he doth by that Scribble (how im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent soever it be) as many of his minde (in another case) are reported to do, father Brats which they are sure are none of their own, because they either have received, or hope to receive some beneficial Courtesies from the Fathers: Therefore for sake of the real and not pretended Father of that piece, I shall say a little to some Passages I observed therein, though very briefly.</p>
                  <p>First, I observe with what a magisterial su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>percilliousness he censures as illiterate, all that are Professors of true <hi>Pyrotechny,</hi> and maintain its Principles, both as to the Preparation and Application of Remedies, the judging, distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing, and curing Diseases, in opposition to those who subscribing to <hi>Galen, Avicen,</hi> and others of that gang, own the distinction of Dogmatists, and Methodists; and have done for many ages, till of late they have wrought upon the facile Nature, or <hi>Cranium</hi> of an easie impression, of a nameless person (of honour for ought I know) to become their Godfather; and now at the years of rotten ripe discretion, to give them a new Name of
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:40704:24"/>
                     <hi>Rational Chemists,</hi> as a distinction (I conceive) between such, whom his wisdom is pleased to style Melancholly Operators, and them; that is, between such who will admit no practical Theorems, whose Confirmation they have not practically received from the Fire; and those more neat, Genteel Chemists, who without knowing the Names and Forms of Furnaces, the degrees, and manner of ordering Fires, the shapes and diversities of Chemical Vessels, can by depth of reading, and profound Reason, tell what are the best Chemical Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, and when, how, and by whom they are best made; and the time, manner, dose, and rule, requisite for the most beneficial ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration of them. This Gentleman I suppose for the honour of the Nation, and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture benefit of the Cadets of the Gentry, will shortly distinguish between the Rational, and Gross mechanical Merchant, Marriner, Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, &amp;c. And for the honour and profit of Generations to come, introduce and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend Rational Pilots, Masters and Captains of Ships, Captains and Commanders of Land Forces; Rational mannagers of Trafique by Sea and Land; as also Dealers by Exchange of Moneys, and the like; and if he can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade those in Authority to listen to, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:40704:24"/>
such a Rational Motion, we may hope (in time) to be provided as well in all these mentioned Cases, as we are now with Iatro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chemical <hi>Galenists.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis as possible, and probable, to be an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert Chemist, without seriously, sedulously, indefatigably, and constantly attending the Mechanical part of <hi>Pyrotechny,</hi> making new daily, pondering also, and amending future Operations by past experience, as to be an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert Anatomist without knowing the use of the Knife, by bare Rational speculation. 'Tis the Mechanist informs, instructs, and confirms the Theorical speculator, and not on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary: But here the Operator acknowledges the highest of his attainments, to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Masters of <hi>Amen-Corner;</hi> and they owe all which they pretend to of Chemical Skill, to this Servant, (thus one hand washeth another) while an impartial by-stander may say, It is pity such Masters and such a Servant should be separated.</p>
                  <p>But why must all that dissent from the <hi>Nil ultrà, praeter idiotas,</hi> of <hi>Pater Noster Row,</hi> be branded for Illiterate? 'Tis well the visible father of this peremptory and petulant Charge is known not to be guilty of, or overgrown with either wit or learning himself, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:40704:25"/>
is as fit a Judge in the Case, as <hi>Midas</hi> was of the excellency of Musick made by <hi>Apollo</hi> on his Harp, or <hi>Pan</hi> on his Pipe; and if he were repaid as well for his Judgement as <hi>Midas</hi> was, his Masters, in case they should lose him, might finde him, though hid under the Covert of a Philosopher, by the same marks that the Farmer in <hi>Aesop</hi> found a lost Servant of his, concealed under the disguise of a Lions Skin.</p>
                  <p>As to the Challenge made by you of deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the grand Controversie by proof, and experimental Demonstration, the World will take notice, although you and we should be silent, how he seeks to evade it by scandalous and reproachful Quibbles, in which his scur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rility will try the utmost of your patience, and will excuse you if you reply with Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar to his canker'd Lines, writ with a pen dipt in gall; I wish that either side had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born to discharge your selves like Cannons, roaring, and rending each other, yielding much smoke, but little light, yet must Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logize for you in the words of the Comick Poet; that it is (on your part) <hi>responsum, non dictum, quia laesit prius;</hi> He first transgrest the bounds of a fair Gamester, and plaid such Butchers play, as both the Pate and Shins,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:40704:25"/>
that if himself get a crackt Crown, he may thank his own indiscretion, and his blustering huffing. I have known an uncivil braving Hector so abusive to a sober Gentleman, that he hath provoked him at length to cudgel him soundly for his unmannerliness; and I could not account it otherwise then just, that he who would not be guided by discretion, should be basted into better manners. But of this a word to the wise.</p>
                  <p>But concerning the thing proposed, and that on such fair terms as cannot be refused with honour, nor accepted, without a silencing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration on one side or other; if it be enough to laugh at the Proposal as impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, upon presumption that so many will not be found, that will trust their Lives, either in your, or any other hands of your Perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and Principles; or if they would, that you might easily give a certain Prognostick of them all, with a Reserve, for this ill-nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd Quibble; that you will cure them all alike, and the Earth cover your failing in so rash an attempt; if, I say, this Answer by themselves be judged sufficient, they must ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count all, to whom that Scribble shall come, gross Ideots, and stupid Dunces; for will any (a degree beyond a Natural in capacity) ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:40704:26"/>
that if they did really judge that such would, or probably might prove the effect, they would not have made it their prime busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, either to have rendred you, by the first ridiculous, in finding none that durst adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to trust your skill; or odious, by perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing such Catachrestical Hangman-like Cures. This charge might with probability and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice be retorted, but I hate recrimination; it being unlikely, that if the Contest were once begun to be thus decided, after a score of instances concerning the vast difference of the safety of true Chemical Remedies, and agreeableness of them to Nature beyond the Galenical Prescriptions, and Carbonado's of Humane Bodies, according to their Rules of Art, scarce any more would be found, that would undergo their Methodical course of Physick, (were there no hazarding of Life, and impairing the Strength, by exhausting the fountain of Life, the Blood) if either Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers or Tears might move so much compassion in the Judges, as to escape their too Fatal clutches: but for peace sake I shall drive the bolt no farther, onely this I shall say, and I hope not transgress the bounds of modesty and sobriety, that my self about eight years or more since, publickly challedged them to

the like Contest, at infinite more oddes, and disadvantage on my part, and will yet make good the same, upon penalty of being infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, and so publickly proclaimed, and my self will proclaim it with as much ignominy, as to place, time, and expressions, as they shall please to prescribe unto me, and will under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to procure the Patients without trouble to them; and let them be divided with all equality possible, half to me, the other half to them: let me be certified of their will to accept the Contest, and if I decline what I of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd, I shall willingly beforehand condemn my self to a future prohibition of all Practice, till I openly do what disgraceful Penance they shall think fit to put upon me, and the like, if I am baffled or worsted in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate; onely let able, impartial Arbiters judge between us, the relation of Fact being first published both in our Native, and in a travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Language, the Judges then let them give publique Sentence, according as the Demerits of each side shall appear to them.</p>
                  <p>This may, and I doubt not but will be put off with a Sardonian laughter, while in the mean time <hi>Haeret lateri lethalis arundo,</hi> the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row galls them too much for a hearty smile; nor will very sober persons fail to laugh at,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:40704:27"/>
and deride them, if they can finde no other Answer then grinning merriment, for so home, and so close followed an Argument; which if once resolved on, as the final issue of the Controversie, would quickly for ever silence one or the other party; and if we practically get the better of them, (as I doubt not) if afterward we do not maintain our own Theseis, and oppose theirs, undisputably on our part, and convincingly on theirs, let us be afterwards accounted onely fortunate illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate Empyricks. But if besides this we publiquely give a full account of their Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rems, Axiomes, Maximes, Method, and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, as well in the Therapeutick, as Theori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal part thereof, and then with undeniable Arguments overthrow their whole Building fundamentally, yet challenge them of Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance (even to pity) in the Principles of true <hi>Pyrotechny,</hi> which we will undertake to make as plain as the Noon-day Sun, to the convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing both of themselves and friends that it is really so: What pretence soever they make to Rational Chemistry (this Charge I would have understood of the generality of them, and as they are a Society) and we will permit their man <hi>Johnson</hi> to lay his Head together with them; whose <hi>Chemical Dictionary</hi> dedicated
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:40704:27"/>
to them, will speak his ability in <hi>Pyrotechny,</hi> should we be silent. If, I say, after our pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical Combat, and experimental Contest, we perform this, then let the titles of <hi>Illiterature</hi> and <hi>Empyricisme</hi> be given to them that best deserve them; and if we do it not, we will own our selves empty vain-glorious Boasters, <hi>nec famâ nec fortunâ dignos.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But 'tis time to recall my self, these Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally Chemical Gentlemen may for ought any man in the world (or they themselves) knows, be the <hi>sans peere Chemists</hi> of <hi>Europe,</hi> if not of the Universe; for I call to minde, and very seasonably, that in their Book of <hi>Precautions and Remedies against the Pestilence,</hi> they crown their work with <hi>(multum in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vo)</hi> a Collection of the choicest Chemical Medicines attainable; which they set down for their sakes who are onely affected with Chemical Preparations, with caution, that they be honestly and faithfully made, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Prescription of the best Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors; among which, I was not a little plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, to finde both the Philosophical Elixirs, for the White and the Red, prescribed, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the dose, and time of taking them, and in what Vehicle, to the discretion of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients; upon which I would query, First,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:40704:28"/>
That seeing there is a Plague of the purse, as well as the person, to which these two Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies should most properly be applied? Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, where they are to be had faithfully and honestly prepared? Certainly by their white fixed Sulphur, and by their red fixt incombustible Oyl of Sulphur, they meant the two tinging Elixirs of the Philosophers, or else they prescribed it at all adventures, any thing unknown to themselves, with a hard name to amuse the vulgar; like him of their Fraternity, whom you instance in your Book, who for a long time prescribed <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curius dulcis,</hi> upon presumption that it was a Vegetable.</p>
                  <p>The other Preparations by them advised, if they did but know experimentally, how secret, hidden, and truly difficult their true Preparation is; and how few among Artists that search after them, attain them, (scarce one of ten thousand) they would not so light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prescribe them, unless withal, they could advise where, and of whom, and at what rates they might be procured; and either ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Directions for their use, or left them, who desired to have them, to be directed by the Preparers and Disposers of them; but to give onely a bare Catalogue of a few hard
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:40704:28"/>
                     <hi>what d'yee call 'ums,</hi> to be procured God knows where, and when; and to be used God knows how, or to what end, however at all adventures, with assured success against the Pestilence, is for grave old men to turn again to boyes play, and dance a Chemical An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique, <hi>&amp; magno conatu, specioseque sub prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>textu nugas agere.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The other part of that Book I shall not meddle with, being unwilling to thrust my Sickle into another mans Harvest, onely wish it might effectually answer its Title, and the Expectation of his Majesty and Council, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the poor sick parties, whose Skins must pay for its defect, the more the pity!</p>
                  <p>For my part, I shall allow every Bird to sing its own note, and every Man to praise or dispraise a Bridge, according as it hath carried him over, or failed him. But this I may, and shall not doubt to affirm, that this hand of God, in case it continue upon us, and increase among us, will prove a signal note of distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, between Physicians elected, and sent forth by God, and those mercenary Hirelings, who either run unsent, or were created by the Schools. The latter having compiled a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-doing Book, for the prevention and era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of the Pestilence, to shew the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:40704:29"/>
they have in their own Prescriptions; in the next place, get as soon, and as far off as they can out of reach of it, except a few of the most confident of them, a very incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable number, considering the large Herd of them, who (shameful to mention, more shameful to practise) in consideration of an unreasonable summe of Money in hand de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, and a more unconscionable Salary by the year expected, with other Conditions, arguing a mercenary distrustful minde, will take such care of the Sick, and afford them such attendance as they shall think fit; when as eight times their number would be too few by half, to attend the Sick, in case of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of this calamity: for if in the most healthful times so great a number of Physici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans be not supernumerary, there being ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily Employment sufficient for most, if not all of them; can it be imagined, that in case the numbers of the Sick should be increased ten for one, or upwards, as in some Contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <hi>London</hi> hath sadly found and felt, a fifth or sixth part of the Doctors in and about this City, will be sufficient to attend those whom God shall visit in so unusual a manner, as to the terror and truculency of the Disease, where multitudes are swept away with such
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:40704:29"/>
rigorous speed, as might command pity in any breast that hath left in it the least room for charitable piety?</p>
                  <p>If the Care and Cure of the Sick be the work, office, and duty of all who consciona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly pretend to the Art of Medicine, this sure is a time in which it is an incumbent duty on all its Professors, to double their vigilan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and industry; yea, unworthy is he the name and title of a Physician, who shall then quit his work and station, when his assistance and help is most needful and required: <hi>Dulcia non meruit qui non gustavit amara.</hi> Here is a time and occasion of exercising all their care and charity with the most religious obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance: If it be the work of Doctors, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond doubt and denial it is, how can they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer the neglect of it to God or their own Conscience?</p>
                  <p>Not but that I judge the pious care of the Magistrate highly commendable, in encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging as many as are conscienciously diligent, at such a time when their work and care is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased, with addition of both danger and hazard to their persons; but for any Doctors to refuse or decline this duty, without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stipulating for a large Reward, before either their Ability or Care hath been made appear
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:40704:30"/>
to the world, will brand as many as shall be found guilty in this kinde with a black note of infamy, not to be born with Honour, nor excused by any Apology.</p>
                  <p>The pretence of having other Patients, and their unwillingness to affright or endanger them, is too narrow a Fig-leaf to cover this their nakedness, and hide their shame: For, first, many (if not most) of considerable For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes leaving the City upon the first alarm of this Visitation, as it much diminisheth the ordinary employment Doctors had usually at other times when the City was free from this Contagion; so especially the terrour of this severe Disease silenceth many others, and swallows up in its larger stream other more inconsiderable Rivelets; so that what they propound in case of the Pestilence, might be an adequate Expedient for providing at this season against other Diseases and Maladies; namely, that a sufficient number of Doctors might either by lot, or mutual consent, be set apart to attend such onely as were free from, and were fearful of the Plague, but others (without admitting any excuse) to attend their Calling on this so weighty an occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and in case any through cowardly fear should neglect or decline this their undoubted
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:40704:30"/>
duty, might they be (for ever after) laid aside as unfaithful Physicians of no value, fit to be marked publiquely with some note of disgrace, in case they should after the removal of this hand of God, presume to reassume their former Practice and Profession.</p>
                  <p>For my part I should give my vote that none such might be admitted publiquely to Practise for the future, that should now desert their station, and unworthily decline this so great duty, till first he had stood publiquely in some eminent place of great Concourse, with a Collar of broken Urinals about his Neck, with a Note of his Fault, Name, and place of abode, that men might know where to finde, and how to beware of such an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful, unworthy Quacksalver. Afterwards when every mans demerits shall be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, (and in so common a Calamity, as in all eminent actions of publique Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, remarkable Deserts cannot go undisco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered) the Magistrate, as his prudence shall direct him, may encourage the Diligent, that others may be stirred up to follow their exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: But a cowardly Physician (like a coward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Captain) is unworthy of fame, fortune, or life.</p>
                  <p>As for their Families, undeserving are they
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:40704:31"/>
the name of Christians, who doing their duty, shall be afraid to trust God in such a matter: But in case any of them be afraid, let them remove where they judge themselves more secure, yet I dare say, seldom will such an obstacle lie in the way of a consciencious Physician? That God who can (and if it stand with his pleasure, and be for his glory will) secure the persons, rules and governs the hearts and spirits of all related to such, whom he shall employ in so pious and charitable a work; let me do my duty, and I will trust God with the rest: this is my judgement, this is, and God willing shall be my practice, and will be of as many as God hath elected and made Physicians. The rest that are other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise minded, I beseech God to convince them of their fault and folly. And, Sir, give me leave to tell you, that I was heartily glad for your sake, to finde in you the same spirit; nor can I think of any in this respect culpable, without regret of minde.</p>
                  <p>If a man be consciencious in this particular, self-preservation as well as a desire to be ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable in his calling, will make him very studious in his search, and earnest at the throne of Grace, that he may be master of real and true, not imaginary, false, and unfaithful
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:40704:31"/>
Remedies, against so truculent and terrible an enemy. And those that ask, seek, and knock out of a pure design of pious serving God, in doing their duty faithfully and effectually, and charitable serving their Neighbour, to the comfort of the Patients, and credit of themselves, the merciful God will hear.</p>
                  <p>Blessed be the Almighty who hath fortified us with such resolution, and hath furnished us with such Remedies, as may be the clear <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plomata</hi> and evident tokens of our Mission; and being sent out by the Lord himself among such great numbers of languishing and distres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed objects of Charity, beseeching him, that he would take away, or lighten his hand, as may stand with his infinite good pleasure, and most blessed will.</p>
                  <p>Sir, you see how these thoughts and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses with you have drawn me beyond my first propounded limits, yea, rather beyond the bounds of an Epistle; for which I crave and hope easily to finde your pardon, since matters of no light importance have thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensibly enticed me, and drawn me out to so unexpected Enlargement; I return now to that <hi>Pitiful Thing,</hi> that hath endeavoured to throw durt upon your umblemisht Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to eclipse your bright lustre; which
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:40704:32"/>
he hath as unsuccessfully prosecuted, as he did foolishly attempt it.</p>
                  <p>The last thing that I shall take notice of in his Scribble, is the Contempt he would throw on your Ability by the despicable relation he makes of your Laboratory, as to which you give me a most satisfactory account: First, that where you at present reside, you are onely a sojourner, and unsettled: Secondly, that he neither saw (nor desired to see) a third part of those Conveniencies which you there have, being admitted but into your first, and most obvious room. But let me adde this as an information to him, and as many as it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns, That a true Son of Art makes his Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces, not they him. I will do that in a small contemptible Earthen Furnace, which he shall not in any, or all of those which he hath set up in his pompous Laboratory, an Engine more for shew and ostentation, then real use; and a true Philosopher needs not the half, nay, nor third part of those specious Fooleries which he hath erected, of which, some there are, which if he were then (and not till then) to be happy, when he could give any, but a most ridiculous account of the use of them, and his intent in erecting them, he would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be for ever (in this world) miserable.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="61" facs="tcp:40704:32"/>
For my own part, although I have (as you know) Furnaces, for conveniency, usefulness, and neatness, so many, and fit, that I dare compare with any Laboratory in, or about the City; yet for a need I could furnish my self and many others in City and Countrey, as I do and have done, for a very ample practice, with half as many, and nothing so sightly, Furnaces: Therefore in my judgement, that part of his <hi>Animadversions</hi> betrayes in him as arrant wisdom, as can be expected from such a heap of idle garrulity, and dung-hill of opprobrious contumely. Perhaps he accounts none furnished with a Laboratory as he ought to be, unless like himself, he lay out upon this outside of Chemistry, so much of other mens Moneys as he can possibly get credit for; and having erected it, do nothing of remark in it, unless to draw the Quintessence of a few Spiders, which (as those who know the constitution of Citizens affirm) that one of thos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Animalcula,</hi> is for them a dangerous and hazzardous bit to swallow, as they are in their simplicity; how much more being so subtillized, may they give an Essence, after the tasting of which it is an extream hazzard if ever he recover and do well.</p>
                  <p>Truly I pity this mans folly and simplicity,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:40704:33"/>
and wonder at his unadvised audacity, that knowing in what relation he stands to a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, a great honourer of true <hi>Pyrotechny,</hi> and as great a defier of the <hi>Galenists</hi> (as they stand in opposition thereto) a very judicious, sober person, and stout defender of true natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Helmontian</hi> Principles, against any, or all their contemners and opposers; that I say he (of all men) should suffer his Name to be put to so unworthy a Piece, full of Reproaches against that Art, and such Artists, for whom this Gentleman (to whom he stands so rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) hath a very great, and more then ordinary kindeness; certainly this verifies the Proverb, <hi>Perdere quos vult Jupiter, hos prius dementat.</hi> And if I might without consulting the Stars, foresee from what <hi>Corner</hi> a Storm may arise, that may shake the four Corners of his Labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory, and bring it down tumbling about his ears. For my part, I know not what to make of him, except a Gudgeon, and as such, I shall at present take leave of him; and for his fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and future instruction and edification, deliver him over into the hands of a worthy friend of mine, a noble heroick spirited <hi>Cook,</hi> to make of him, if not what he pleaseth, yet what he can; whether Fish, or Flesh, or red Herring.</p>
