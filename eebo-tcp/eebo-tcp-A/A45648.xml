            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N these preposterous times many vices are predominant but amongst all the whole brood of vices, there is none so great, there is none grown to that height, ther's none so seprous as this of Puritanisme, the errours of which Sect by the grace of God, I will plainly Anatomize and lay open to the view of all men, but first it is requisite that wee should exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine who is pure. Secondly, what creatures they are that count themselves pure. Thirdly, the effects of their purity, Fourthly, their opinions and Hypocriticall lives. Fiftly, whether the fruit of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity be Hypocrisie. Sixtly and lastly, the difference betwixt a true Protestant and a dissembling Puritan, all which points in their order by Gods assistance I shall lay open &amp; plainly decipher, with as much brevity as possible I can, desiring all judicious and true Protestants, to reade it with as much care, and as free from envie, as I shall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse in the writing, for God witnesse with me, although I hate their opinions, I love the men, and it shall be mine (and ought to be the prayer of every true Christian) to God that he would be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to illuminate their darkned judgements, to open their eyes and guide their wandring feet into the way of peace, as touching the first point or question who is pure, I hope it is needlesse to tell any beleever, yet I will give you one testimony which shall serve as a prop, unto that man, if there be such a one which shall stagger in his beliefe, and doubt of Gods purity, you may read in the 19. <hi>Psalme</hi> the 82. <hi>ver.</hi> These words, <hi>The Statutes of the Lord are right and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce the heart, the Commandement of the Lord is pure, and giveth light vnto the eyes,</hi> Likewise <hi>Psal.</hi> 25. <hi>at the</hi> 7. <hi>ver. Gratious and Righteous is the Lord, for he will teach sinners in the way.</hi> So in the 33. <hi>Psal.</hi> at the 34 <hi>verse, Sing unto the Lord a song, sing prayses unto him with a good courage, for the word of the Lord is true, and all his workes are faithfull,</hi> thus much shall serve as touching this point, which I trust is apparently manifest in every one of our hearts, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that God is pure, neverthelesse it will aske some labour, to make it apparent, that there is none pure but God, for in these latter times
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:94302:3"/>
since, ha's got so great a predomination in some mens hearts, and so faire a pretence withall, that they presume to cover all their vicious opinions with the pure mantle of Religion, now to prove that there is none pure but God, I might quote many places in Scripture, but it were a needlesse labour bestow'd on so worthlesse a subject, onely these 3. shall serve, the first of which, you shall find in the 7. of <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.</hi> at the 20. <hi>ver. There is not a just man upon Earth that doth good and sinneth not, the second proofe you shall find in the</hi> 14. <hi>Psal.</hi> 2. <hi>ver. there is none that doth good, no not one.</hi> Likewise <hi>Rom.</hi> 30. 23. <hi>all have sinned and come short of the glory of God.</hi> As touching the third point what sort of Creatures they are that count themselves pure, namely sinfull men, sons and daughters of <hi>Adam,</hi> we are all heires of Originall sinne from our first Father, now if we be borne in sinne, if we be spotted with leprosie, we cannot be pure, but per-adventure they will plead that the power of originall sinne and the stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth of the law was abolisht by Christs death, to this I answer, that to all beleevers it was, for Christs obedience made full satisfaction for our first Parents disobedience, but then how can they cleare themselves from their actuall transgressions, their sins of omission, their sins of Commission, their wilfull sins, their sins of ignorance, are those men pure, that produce naught but the effects of impurity, are those men worshippers of God, which worship their owne er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous opinions, are they lovers of Christ which they never saw, yet hate their brothers whom they see daily, are these men pleasers of God, which preferre their own wils before Gods pleasure, <hi>non est optima quae placet, sed quae decet,</hi> that is not best which pleases, but that which becomes thee, now whether it is most becomming to please God or thy selfe, I leave it to thy consideration; God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands thee to love thy brother, wilt thou hate him, then surely thou preferst thy own pleasure before Gods command, but of this anone, moreover Christ while he was conversant on Earth laboured to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert sinners, I came not to call the Righteous but sinners to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, sayes that Physitian of our Soules Christ Jesus, he spent his time in curing the diseas'd, in feeding the poore, in performing good and pious works, now if these men be Imitators of Christ, we shall suddenly discerne, by their actions, <hi>a good tree bringeth not forth corrupt fruit, Luke</hi> 6. 43. Now let us examine the actions of these <hi>Seperatists alias Puritanes,</hi> the fruit of a true Christian must be faith in <hi>Christ Jesus,</hi> Secondly, the fruit of that faith must be springing, it must not be a dead faith, now the greatest expression of a lively
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:94302:3"/>
faith is good works, as you may read in the 2. of St. <hi>James,</hi> at the 26. <hi>ver. As the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without good workes is dead,</hi> Is it so then that charitable workes are the lively fruits of faith, is it so then that faith without good workes is dead, what just cause have we then to feare that those men which terme themselves <hi>Seperatists,</hi> what cause have we J say to feare that their faith is a dead faith, for they are so farre from good workes themselves, that they will perswade others from the exercise of that pious duty, Thirdly, the badge of a lively faith is humility, &amp; a reverend zeale in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming Gods service, as we may read a perfect example in Christ Jesus, who when he pray'd humbled himselfe before his Father, as you may see in the 22. <hi>chap. Luke, ver.</hi> 21. <hi>And when he was withdrawne from them about a stones cast he kneeled downe and prayed.</hi> Likewise you may read how Humility and reverence was accepted in the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican, when boasting Arrogancy was rejected in the proud <hi>Pharisee, Luke</hi> the 18. <hi>ver.</hi> 13. Now that these sort of men are proud, may easily be exprest, for they are so farre from humility, that at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of the Sacrament which is the greatest and surest meanes of our Salvation, they will not vouchsafe to kneele but sit on their Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shions or places of ease, they are so lazie, or as we may terme them so extream proud, that they will not vouchsafe to goe to meet Christ, but he must come to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the people of <hi>Hierusalem</hi> when they heard Christ was comming to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> City, they ran to meet him, they strew'd the way, they met him with a Song of prayse and thankesgiving, <hi>Hosana, Hosana in the highest, blessed is the King of Israel which commeth in the name of the Lord, Joh.</hi> 12. <hi>ver.</hi> 13. Beloved, did these people so extoll the Lord? Did they reverence him, did they run to meet him, because they had received temporall Blessings of him, because he had cured their lame and given sight unto the blind, and shall not we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence him, shall not we earnestly run to meet him that heald our leprous soules, that gave eyes of understanding to our blind judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that dyed to redeeme us from eternall death, surely beloved if we shall neglect this gratefull duty, these <hi>Jewes,</hi> these people of <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem</hi> shall rise up in judgement against us, but to my former dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, our Precisians thinke it to much labour, it savors of supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to come up to the Communion Table, therefore if the bread and wine which is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> signe of our substantiall Savior be not brought to them, they will rather choose to disturbe the whole Congregation to make a mutenie in the presence of God then be perswaded from their dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolicall opinions, the next point we are to examine is what sort of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:94302:4"/>
men they be that are of this opinion, to wit Mechanick persons, for the most part unlectured grooms, <hi>Coachmen, Feltmakers, Coblers, Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, Glovers,</hi> hauking <hi>Ironmongers</hi> walking after the imaginations of their owne hearts, whose consciences are in a consumption, and wits as rusty as a peece of old Iron which has been broken and throwne on the dunghill, these rusty companions are knowne well enough, in every street their abominations breake forth, and like to spreading <hi>Vlcers</hi> infect poore innocent soules, this beguiler sells his pils very cheape, you may buy one for a peny, but take heed, taste it not for if you doe, it will spoyle your Common prayer; but to proceed, that they are ignorant soules, may appeare in this, that they preferre the Discipline of ignorant men of their owne Society, before the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of learned men, they prefer the drosse before the treasure, they prefer a dunce that will flatter and wrest his text according to the fancies of his Auditors, before a learned Divine, that teaches Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox Doctrine, that will open with the Key of knowledge, the Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net of the Scriptures, alas, Orthodox Doctrine is to cold of disgesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for their queazy stomacks, it is to deepe for them, oh no, it is the language of the beast, and they will not heare it, they will rather for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake the Church, and get under a hedge then endure to be told of their iniquities, so much concerning what sorts of people, they are that think themselves pure, next I come to the effects of their purity, they are proud, they are envious, they are enemies to the Church, they are enemies to learning, they are selfe-wild, selfe-conceited, they are hearers but not doers, they are covetous, they are lyers, they are persecutors of the poore, oppressors of the needy. In fine, J may say with <hi>David,</hi> ther's not one good, no not one, now if this bee the fruit of Purity, let all true Christians judge, next for their opinions, namely, that it is lawfull to seperate themselves from the wicked, but what availes it to seperate themselves from the performers or actors of iniquity, when they retaine and keep the same iniquity in their hearts, what is it for a man to leave the Society of a publique whore, and keepe a private one, what is it to hate swearing and love lying, what is it for me to hate a vice in another, and love it in my selfe, could they separate themselves from their sinnes, as easily as they seperate themselves from the Society of the wicked (as they terme us) I would be one of their conventicle, but so long as J see so much deceipt, so much Poyson in a golden pill, so much base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse covered under a Religions mantle, ile rather choose to be a dore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper in the house of the Lord, then a bauling Pastor in their Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:94302:4"/>
Fiftly, for their lives and conversations, they are men which respect their profits above their consciences, for let a man be of what condition soever, if they thinke they can profit by him, then they will expresse a great deale of formality, a great deale of love and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, but make tryall of their love, and then in verity you shall find them inwardly <hi>Jewes,</hi> though outwardly Saints, they are all for profit, nothing for loue, their Zeale ha's forgot what St. <hi>Paul</hi> sayes in the 2 chap. 1 Epistle of St. <hi>John</hi> about the 9, 10, and 11. verses. <hi>He that saith he is in the light and hateth his brother is in darknesse,</hi> Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise <hi>chap.</hi> 3. <hi>ver.</hi> 15, <hi>whosoever hateth his brother is a Murderer,</hi> and you know that no Murderer hath eternall life abiding in him, but they will say that they doe not hate their brethren but the wicked, to this I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, so long as they continue in sinne they are brothers unto the most wicked man, and in hating him they hate their brother, for we are all Sons of one Father, or will you say that all they that are not of your o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion are y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wicked, it does appeare so, for you have seperated your selves from us, and what greater symptome of hate can there be then seperation, but yet take heed, judge not lost you be judged, againe, ha's the wickednesse of the people made the Church wicked, why should you hate that, is a Surplice, a bug-beare, or is the Common Prayer of force to blister your precise eares, if you should vouchsafe to heare it, you may read in <hi>Matth. chap.</hi> 24. <hi>ver.</hi> 28. these words, <hi>Wheresoever the carkasse is, there will the Eagles be gathered together,</hi> this carkasse may be termed the word of God, and the <hi>Eagles</hi> all true Christians, now if the word of God be taught in the Church, let all true Christians resort thither, as for them that thinke to goe to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven blind-fold, let them goe on, let them spend their dayes accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the imaginations of their owne hearts; let them live securely, yet let them remember that <hi>secura vita est mare mortuum,</hi> a secure life is a dead Sea, let them seperate, let them rayle, let them raigne in vice; yet let them at last remember, that for all these things they must come to judgement, Lastly, the differences betwixt a true <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant</hi> and a <hi>Puritane,</hi> are declared in these foure things, a <hi>Protestant</hi> will deale uprightly, a <hi>Puritan</hi> will cozen his Father, a true <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant</hi> will love his enemy, a <hi>Puritane</hi> will hate every man, a true <hi>Protestant</hi> will serve God devoutly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and expresse it in his life and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation, a <hi>Puritane</hi> will make a zealous shew of serving God, but expresse the contrary in his life and conversation, a <hi>Protestant</hi> will relieve the poore and fatherlesse, a <hi>Puritane</hi> will oppresse the father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse and Widdow, as it is apparent in too many of your zealous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors,
