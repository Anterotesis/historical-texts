         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

You</hi> and <hi>your King</hi> (if he <hi>allow</hi> of your <hi>doings</hi>) will I severely Judge,
<hi>saith the Lord God,</hi> except ye speedily Repent, and all look better to
your Ways than hitherto you have done. <hi>O consider this, ye forgetters of

<hi>doubled</hi> your <hi>wickedness</hi> in the same thing this year also, to provoke my
Soul to arise up against you to your hurt: And the <hi>Beesom</hi> on the top

surely it shall come to passe, that if ye will not yet <hi>repent</hi> of your

will do such things amongst you in my judgement, and fury poured
forth, that the Nations about that hear thereof, shall stand <hi>amazed</hi> at
thee. O <hi>Revolted</hi> and <hi>Back-sliden</hi> Nation; whither art thou gone al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready?
and whither wilt thou run, if thou be suffered to go on? Into
the Pit that thou art step already, and into the nethermost hell thou
wilt fall if I let thee alone. But <hi>I will arise, saith God,</hi> I will <hi>execute
Righteous Judgement</hi> in thee, with <hi>fire</hi> and <hi>sword</hi> will I <hi>plead</hi> with thee,

with thy <hi>Lewdnesse,</hi> and <hi>strengthen</hi> thy <hi>ungodly hands</hi> in thy <hi>wicked ways,</hi>
and say in their hearts, <hi>O this is a good day, these are good Subjects, this is
the time we have long looked for; now we reign; now we may do what we
will, and who shall controul us? who shall hinder us from filling our selves
with all manner of delights? now we are setled in our way; now will we Build
our decayed Houses, and Restore our fallen Worships; now will we Repair
the broken Fences of our Parks, that we may have Game to the full; now shall
our Horses be well fed for the Race, that they may fully please us; now let the
Cock-pits be looked to, for that</hi> (cruel) <hi>Sport, and let our Bowling-Alleys
be well Dressed for our daily Recreation; Now shall the Stage-players for
our delight, have their full Liberty, and all the Sons of Vanity have due
Encouragement for the Old things we Love, and that which is New, though
never so much the Better, our souls Loath; We like the Old Ways of our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
because when they had Lord-Bishops and their Minster Services with
Mattens, and Evensong, with Organs, and Singing-boys, and such like
Things, then there was Peace and Plenty; and when the Neighbourhood
could meet together and sit about a Bone-fire or May-pole, or under a Bower,
and drink strong drink, and tell Stories, and Sing and Roar, then there
was Love and Agreement; And when Playes, and Pastimes, and Wakes
were duely frequented and observed, then was it a Merry Time, and a Joyful
Land, and all went well in those Days, when such Things were on foot; And
when those that said</hi> they feared the Lord, and so could not joyn with us,
but rather Witnessed against us, and Reproved us for such Things, <hi>were
taken a Course withal, O then was it a good Day, say many; And as it was then
so would we have it now,</hi> saith your Vain and Wicked hearts, O ye <hi>fallen</hi>
sons and daughters of <hi>Adam!</hi> And I see you, <hi>saith the Lord God,</hi> with <hi>both</hi>
your <hi>hands</hi> endeavouring these Things, and abusing my Power, if possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to set up the <hi>Devils Kingdom</hi> with it; And thus quite contrary to my
Ordinance, <hi>saith the Lord,</hi> are you become as a <hi>Terrour to the Good,</hi> and
an <hi>Encouragement</hi> to them that <hi>do Evil,</hi> and mine <hi>Eye seeth</hi> you right
well; and my <hi>Heart</hi> considereth you thorowly, and I cannot Love you,
for <hi>prophaneness</hi> and <hi>hypocrisie</hi> is your <hi>covering,</hi> and you are as the <hi>cloaths</hi>
of a <hi>Menstruous Woman</hi> in my sight. Away with your <hi>vain</hi> Worships,
<hi>saith God,</hi> my soul <hi>loaths</hi> your <hi>Sabbaths</hi> and <hi>Services</hi> thereon, yea, your
<hi>Sacraments</hi> are a <hi>burden</hi> to me; I <hi>hate</hi> your <hi>Prayers, Praises, Professions</hi> and
<hi>Confessions,</hi> for you mend not your lives and doings at all; I will stir up
my <hi>Jealousie</hi> and it shall kindle like <hi>flames</hi> of <hi>fire</hi> upon you, and utterly
<hi>consume</hi> the <hi>joy</hi> of your <hi>hearts,</hi> and for <hi>joy</hi> the <hi>bitterest</hi> of <hi>sorrows</hi> shall <hi>seize</hi>
upon you, and you shall become a <hi>burden</hi> to your selves, except you
speedily <hi>Repent</hi> and <hi>turn</hi> to the Lord God, from whom you are far gone
away. For I have a long time <hi>held my peace, saith the Lord,</hi> but now I
will <hi>cry</hi> like a Travelling Woman, I will <hi>destroy</hi> and <hi>devour</hi> at once, I
will <hi>lay waste</hi> the <hi>Mountains</hi> and the <hi>Hills,</hi> because they have not <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered</hi>
my <hi>Power</hi> with <hi>fruits</hi> of <hi>Righteousness</hi> to me. And the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
of People who are as Grashoppers in thy Bowels <hi>devouring</hi> every
green thing, and <hi>spending</hi> my Creatures upon their <hi>Lusts,</hi> not <hi>regarding</hi>
my Glory at all, shall be as heaps of <hi>fuel</hi> for the <hi>fire</hi> of my <hi>Jealousie,</hi>
and it shall <hi>kindle</hi> upon them, and none shall <hi>quench</hi> it, neither shall it
