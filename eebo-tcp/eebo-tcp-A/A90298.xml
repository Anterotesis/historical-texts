         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHen I firſt heard of
the Death of your
Dear Child, and
only Son, I much deplored your Loſs,
and was greatly concern'd to think
how you would bear it, as conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that your affections towards him
were exceeding great, and ſurpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
the common and ordinary Love
of Women; and that your Heart
was ſet ſo much upon him, that
your Life ſeem'd to be wrapt up in
<pb facs="tcp:137153:3"/>
his; ſo that he could hardly die,
but his Death muſt go near to kill
you too.</p>
            <p>I knew indeed your Prudence and
Religion to be very great, yet I
much feared that upon ſo ſevere a
tryal, your Paſſion might get the
ſtart of your Reaſon, and ſo far over
come it, as to prove a great prejudice
to all wiſe Conſiderations: And as I
feared, ſo I was credibly inform'd
by ſome that were Spectators of your
ſorrows, that you laid the Death of
your Son ſo much to Heart, and
was ſo deeply ingulph'd in ſorrows,
that like <hi>Rachel</hi> you refuſed to be
comforted: And the truth is, you
had a ſingular loſs, and therefore
might very well be afforded ſome
grains of allowance in ſorrowing
more than ordinary for the loſs of
<pb facs="tcp:137153:3"/>
your only Son; the moſt intenſe ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
being deſcribed and repreſented
in Scripture by <hi>Mourning as for
an only Son.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore when I underſtood
that you took on ſo heavily, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
mourning and afflicting your
ſelf at ſuch a great rate, I thought
it my duty to do my beſt endeavours
(as having received ſo many Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
from your Family) to ſupport
part of the foundation when it was
ſinking with the weight of over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
ſorrow. And whilſt I was
ſtudying for ſome Counſels that might
be proper for one in your caſe, it
was my misfortune to meet with the
like ſad Providence in the death of
one of my own Children, which made
me more ſenſible of the greatneſs of
your loſs, who was bereav'd of your
<pb facs="tcp:137153:4"/>
only Child; ſo that I had now a new
work to do, which was to maſter
my own Grief, and to keep thoſe ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows
within compaſs, which naturally
ariſe upon the loſs of our neareſt and
deareſt Relations: whereupon im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
I conſulted not with fleſh
and blood, which I knew would lean
more to the ſide of Paſſion than
Reaſon, but begg'd of God that he
would endue me with wiſdom from
above, and that whilſt I ſhewed the
reſentments of a man, I might behave
my ſelf like a Chriſtian, and <hi>not ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
like others without hope.</hi>
And being by the Divine Aſſiſtance
ſupply'd with the Conſiderations in the
following Diſcourſe, which wrought
effectually upon me towards the miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating
of my ſorrows; I thought that
the ſame remedy which I found from
<pb facs="tcp:137153:4"/>
them might very rationally be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
to another, and proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
work the ſame Cure upon your
Ladyſhip, which they had done upon
my ſelf. And ſo <hi>Cicero</hi> relates of
himſelf, that being in great afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for the loſs of his Dear Daughter
<hi>Tullia,</hi> he was forc'd to fly to the
Precepts and Arguments of ſome
famous Philoſophers for comfort and
relief, and to propound to himſelf the
Examples of ſome Eminent Perſons
who had behaved themſelves with
great temper and moderation under
the like ſorrowful circumſtances. And
notwithſtanding all the wiſe Precepts
&amp; brave Examples of others, he found
it ſo hard to be reconciled to Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and to conquer his Grief for
the loſs of ſuch an Excellent and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
Daughter, that he was fain
<pb facs="tcp:137153:5"/>
to ſet upon writing his Book <hi>of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation,</hi>
on purpoſe to divert his
Melancholy, and to beguile the tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
of his Sorrows. And praiſed
be God, I have had the happineſs to
find the ſame benefit by Conſideration,
which <hi>Cicero</hi> did. And hope that
having experimented the benefit of
my own Counſels, I<note n="*" place="margin">Deinde plus me habiturum au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toritatis non dubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabam ad excitan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum te, ſi prius ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe conſurrexiſſem. <hi>Seneca ad Helviam.</hi>
               </note>
may be better qualifi'd
to win both upon your
Ladyſhips Reaſon and
Judgment.</p>
            <p>Indeed your Ladyſhip has had
ſomewhat the greater tryal, as loſing
a Son, and an only Son, <hi>Quid e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nim
utilius filio? quid jucun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius

Conſolatione:</hi> What is more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
and uſeful than a Son? and
what is more pleaſant and dearer
<pb facs="tcp:137153:5"/>
to us than an only Son? And yet he
tells us of<note n="*" place="margin">At filium &amp; unicum <hi>Q. Fabius,</hi> praeterea Conſula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem, qui jam mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas res geſſerat, &amp; majores cogitabat, amiſit: ne<expan>

               </note> 
               <hi>Q. Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius,</hi>
who loſt his on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Son, one that was
in a place of great
Dignity and Honour
in the Common-wealth,
and had got a great
reputation by doing
brave and excellent
things, and would have been more
famous if he had liv'd; That he
was ſo well reconcil'd to the Death of
his only Son, and bore it ſo bravely,
that he ſtood up and made a large
ſpeech, and a very trim, ſolid,
and even Oration in Commendation
of his Son, and recited his great
Vertues without lamenting his
Death.</p>
            <p>And he makes further mention of
<pb facs="tcp:137153:6"/>
one <hi>Q. Martius,</hi> a King, who loſt
his only Son and Heir Apparent to
the Crown, and of many others, as
<hi>Xenophon, Caſſius, Pericles,</hi>
who had the misfortune to bury and
loſe their Sons, when they were come
to be men, and were perſons of great
worth, of ſingular prudence and
piety, and of a growing fame and
reputation in the World; who car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
it with great prudence and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
and ſhewed themſelves
great Maſters of their Paſſion upon
theſe ſad occaſions.</p>
            <p>But perhaps theſe Examples of a
Maſculine patience may ſeem not to
ſuit with the ſoftneſs of your Lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips
temper, nor agreeable to the
natural tenderneſs of your Sex;
Men being always accounted the more
hardy and invulnerable, and leſs lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb facs="tcp:137153:6"/>
to the impreſſions of ſorrow than
Women, whoſe very conſtitution does
give a lift and advantage to their
Paſſions; for being the weaker Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels
they cannot ſo well contain their
reſentments, and ſupport their ſpirits
in affliction, as thoſe that are ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.
And although the Poets feign that
<hi>Niobe</hi> was turn'd into a Statue,
becauſe of her weeping ſo ſtifly for
the death and ſlaughter of her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren;
yet they make no mention of her
Husband <hi>Amphion,</hi> that the he
was any ways concern'd at loſs of
them. And therefore ſome inſtances
of the like patience and moderation
in ſome of your own Sex, are more
likely to prevail with your Ladyſhip,
and to excite you to their imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
I crave leave therefore to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
the ſame Examples which <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:137153:7"/>
did to <hi>Marcia</hi> upon the very
ſame account. Now the Examples
which he produces are <hi>Octavia</hi> and
<hi>Livia:</hi> Each of which had the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune
to loſe a Son, and they were
a pair of very hopeful and pregnant
Youths, and of great expectations in
the World. <hi>Octavia,</hi> ſhe laid ſo
much to heart the death of her <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellus,</hi>
that ſhe could not endure
the least mention of his name, but
was ready to ſink whenever ſhe
heard it, and would not admit
that the least word of comfort ſhould
be ſpoken unto her. <hi>Talis</hi> (ſayes
<hi>Seneca) per omnem vitam fuit,
qualis in funere,</hi> ſhe mourn'd and
took on at the ſame rate all her life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
as ſhe did at the time of the
Funeral. But <hi>Livia</hi> ſhe behaved
her ſelf quite otherwiſe, and though
<pb facs="tcp:137153:7"/>
ſhe lost her <hi>Druſus,</hi> who was a
great man at preſent, and riſing to
be a Prince; yet ſhe beheld the pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous
Funeral that was made for him,
and how his Death was lamented by
the whole Nation as a publick and
general loſs, without falling into any
great fit of Paſſion, and as <hi>Seneca</hi>
phraſes it, <hi>ut primum intulit tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulo,
ſimul &amp; illum &amp; dolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem
ſuum poſuit,</hi> ſhe buried all
her ſorrow in his Grave, and laid
aſide her grief as ſoon as he was laid
in the ground. And having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
theſe Examples to <hi>Marcia,</hi>
he refers it to her wiſdom and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion
which of them ſhe would
chuſe to follow. But I dare not
make any ſuch propoſition to your
Ladyſhip, or make the leaſt question
which way your choice is determined,
<pb facs="tcp:137153:8"/>
being well aſſured that you steer all
the actions of your life by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs
of Reaſon and Religion. So
that I need not tell you, that <hi>Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi>
is the Chriſtians Motto, and
that there is <hi>quaedam &amp; dolendi
modeſtia,</hi> A Rule of Decency to
be obſerv'd in our very Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>And therefore if your Ladyſhip
will be pleaſed to pardon the trouble
and preſumption of this Dedication,
I ſhall add little more, but only to
make ſome Apology, and to acquaint
you with the reaſon why this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
was preſented no ſooner to
your hands. And truly I can give
you no other reaſon but what the
Excellent <hi>Cicero</hi> and <hi>Seneca</hi> have
given long before to excuſe their
writing their Tracts of Conſolation

a Comforter would
hardly be admitted, or
very welcome to you
when you were in the
Zenith of your ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows,

improper, as Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
think it in other

that your ſorrows
have had a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
time to ſpend

your tears, as may be preſum'd, is
pretty well abated, I thought that
this Diſcourſe would come at the moſt
<pb facs="tcp:137153:9"/>
opportune and convenient time to
have your Conſideration, and to put
a full ſtop to your Mourning.</p>
            <p>And now that I have given your

came ſo late, perhaps others
may require a reaſon why it came ſo
ſoon, and why I would venture to
expoſe it to publick, eſpecially in ſuch
a Critical Age, wherein the moſt
Correct Diſcourſes can hardly paſs
muſter with ſome captious Wits, and
eſcape their cenſure and reflection.
But the moſt that I can ſay for
my ſelf why I have publiſht ſuch
a ſlender Diſcourſe is this, That
although there is a great plenty of
Authors who have written excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
well upon this ſubject of the
great unreaſonableneſs of intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Mourning for the Dead; yet
<pb facs="tcp:137153:9"/>
few have ſo confined themſelves as
to handle it with a particular reſpect
to the loſs and Death of Children;
which being a common and daily Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity,
and the ſorrows thereupon
ſo mightily prevailing, and judged to
be not only natural but highly rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable,
I thought with my ſelf, that
it might not be amiſs to endeavour
to obviate this vulgar Error, and
to lay down ſuch Arguments as
might be a perpetual fence againſt
all inordinate ſorrowings for the loſs
of Children. And I hope that my
good intentions herein will make ſome
Atonement for the failings of my
Pen. And that it will be a great
Provocation to ſome able and judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Divines to ſet upon providing
and furniſhing the World with bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and more ſubſtantial Arguments

to the great ſcandal both of
their reaſon and their Chriſtian Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief.</p>
            <p>I have, as your Ladyſhip may
eaſily ſee, avoided all flowery Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions,

            <p>But after all it must be confeſs'd,
that you have had a great affliction
and a deplorable loſs in the Death of
your only Child, and only Son: But
I doubt not but God will give you a

Daughters; and that by your eminent

            <p>BEfore I fall directly upon the
words in the Text, it may be
convenient and neceſſary to
give you ſome previous account of
the occaſion of the Death of the
Child which <hi>David</hi> had by <hi>Bath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheba,</hi>
in the time of whoſe ſickneſs
<hi>David</hi> mourn'd exceedingly, and
was much caſt down, and took on
heavily, and after whoſe Death he
ſeem'd to be comforted, and to take
heart; which occaſion'd theſe words
that I have now read unto you. Now
in the Chapter immediately before
this, we have a ſad ſtory and rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Davids</hi> Adultery and Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;
how that from the temptation
of his own idleneſs, and <hi>Bathſheba</hi>'s
Beauty, he committed Folly with
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:137153:12"/>
her, and drew aſide the Curtains of
her Husbands Retirements; and when
he had overcome and corrupted the
Wife, there is mention of the great
Artifices which he uſed to bring
<hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi> the Husband to cloak and
cover this foul and ſhameful ſin of
his; and when <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi> out of pure
Loyalty and a hearty Zeal for his
ſervice, refus'd to take that eaſe and
pleaſure which <hi>David</hi> under a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
of love and friendſhip advis'd
him to, and when all thoſe little
arts and ignoble devices of enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
him in his Palace, and at his
Table, and making him drunk,
would not bring <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi> to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
then how baſely and unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily
does he plot and contrive his
Murder, by giving Orders to his Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
to ſet him in the moſt dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
place, in the Front of the Battel?
which poor Innocent <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi> might
poſſibly take for an Honour, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret
it an Argument and eſteem
of his greater Courage, when in
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:137153:13"/>
truth, he was onely plac'd there as
a mark to be ſhot at, and to fall a
Sacrifice to his Sovereigns Luſt.
Which accordingly hapned, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi>
being ſlain upon the ſpot, and dying
in that ſtation where it was not like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he ſhould live. And when <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
had thus ſecretly in his heart de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
<hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riahs</hi> Death; yet when
news was brought to him that
<hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi> was dead, he cunningly
and ſlily pretends to look upon it
as no other than a Caſualty, the
misfortune of War, ſaying with
himſelf, that ſuch chances will
come; and bid the Meſſenger tell
<hi>Joab</hi> that there was no reaſon why
he ſhould be troubled or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
at the Death of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah;</hi>
for there was no ſaving any mans
life in Battel, none could be pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledg'd
from Death in Warlike
Encounters; and that the Arrows
or Bullets made no diſtinction,
and that all are alike liable to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,
and that <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi> might
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:137153:13"/>
as well fall and be ſlain as any other
in the Army; which is the ſence of
thoſe very words which <hi>David</hi>
caus'd to be return'd to <hi>Joab,</hi> in the
25. <hi>ver.</hi> of the foregoing Chapter.
<hi>Then David ſaid unto the Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
Thus ſhalt thou ſay unto</hi> Joab,
<hi>Let not this thing diſpleaſe thee:
For the Sword devoureth one as
well as another.</hi> And laſtly, When
<hi>David</hi> had thus diſpatcht and caus'd
the Innocent Husband to be made
away, he then takes the guilty Wife
into his poſſeſſion and marries her,
and expects to live many happy and
pleaſant days in mutual endearments.
But though <hi>David</hi> thought that the
marrying her would legitimate their
love, and take off the old ſcandal of
their former Embraces, yet it was an
act highly offenſive to God, and is
ſo expreſt in the laſt <hi>v.</hi> of the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<hi>And when the mourning was
paſt,</hi> David <hi>ſent and fet her to his
Houſe and ſhe became his Wife, and
bare him a Son; but the thing which
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:137153:14"/>
David had done diſpleaſed the
Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But then notwithſtanding that
<hi>David</hi> had committed thoſe two
horid ſins of Adultery and Murder,
yet he had not any true ſenſe and
feeling of his guilt, nor that remorſe
of Conſcience which he ſhould have
had for ſins of that Crimſon die; but
he rubs on a conſiderable time, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any regret or ſign of repentance:
which inſenſibility and hardneſs of
heart we may juſtly aſcribe to his
living in eaſe, and enjoying the
Charms of <hi>Bathſheba</hi>'s Beauty, which
at firſt inticed him to ſin and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
made him forget it, whilſt his
Soul was ſteep'd in pleaſure and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing
in the injoyment of his new
Spouſe. But whilſt <hi>David</hi> was in his
Nuptial jollity, and ſwallowed up
in fond Careſſes and doting upon
that Beauty which had formerly
bewitcht him, God ſtirs up his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<hi>Nathan</hi> to give him ſome check
and interruption in his ſolaces, by
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:137153:14"/>
propounding ſomething that might
bring his late horrid ſins to his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance.</p>
            <p>And accordingly the Prophet does
his office, and propounds to him the
Parable of the poor man with his lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Ewe-Lamb. How that this was his
only Companion, his only Darling,
his Boſom Friend, that he had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe to love and delight in, nor
that he could call his own, but this
one poor Innocent Creature; and
yet there was a rich man which had
a numerous Flock, and enough to
make a Feaſt for any Friend or Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
whatſoever, and yet was guilty
of ſo much incivility and injuſtice,
as to take away this ſingle Lamb from
a poor man, with a pretence that he
needed it to make an Entertainment,
which he might have done without
the leaſt wrong or detriment to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
as having ſuch a number of his
own, and ſo many which he might
well have ſpar'd.</p>
            <p>Which Parable was no ſooner
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:137153:15"/>
propounded to <hi>David,</hi> but he reſents
the Act with a great deal of indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
and delivers his opinion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him that ſhould do ſuch a fact,
as an unpardonable offender, and
that he was guilty of ſuch a high
piece of injuſtice, that he was not
fit to live. For him that had enough
of his own, and yet to invade the
right and property of a poor man, and
to rob him of his little All, was in
<hi>Davids</hi> Judgment an unſufferable
wrong and injury, and that he that
did it, deſerv'd nothing leſs than
Death; for ſo are the words in the
fifth <hi>ver.</hi> of this Chapter: <hi>And Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids
anger was greatly kindled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the man. And he ſaid to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,
As the Lord liveth, the man
that hath done this thing ſhall ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
die. And he ſhall reſtore the Lamb
fourfold becauſe he did this thing,
and becauſe he had no pity:</hi> So juſt
and ſevere was <hi>David</hi> in condemning
the robbing of a poor man, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
away the ſmall ſubſtance he had.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:137153:15"/>
But then when the Prophet took
upon him to make a nearer Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation
of the caſe, and to bring
it home to himſelf, and point-blank
to charge him with the like injuſtice
which he had ſo ſeverely condemned
in another, ſaying, <hi>Thou art the
man:</hi> We muſt needs think that
<hi>David</hi> was much ſtartled when the
guilt recoil'd upon himſelf, and that
his own Conſcience made the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound.
But then when it was brought
ſo cloſe to him, that there was no
avoiding his own ſelf-Condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>David</hi> preſently makes an inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous
Confeſſion, ſaying, <hi>I have
ſinned againſt the Lord.</hi> And ſuch
we may obſerve are the mercies of
God, that his pardon follows imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
upon his Confeſſion. <hi>And
Nathan ſaid unto David, The Lord
hath alſo put away thy ſin, thou ſhalt
not die,</hi> in the 13. <hi>v.</hi> Howbeit, in
the next <hi>v.</hi> ſays the Prophet, <hi>Becauſe
thou haſt by this deed given great
occaſion to the Enemies of the Lord
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:137153:16"/>
to blaſpheme, the Child alſo that is
born unto thee ſhall ſurely dy.</hi> Where
we may obſerve, that although God
was pleaſed to grant him the greateſt
pardon of his life; yet he does not
give him a general pardon from other
Puniſhments, but aſſures him at the
ſame time that he granted him his
life, that he ſhould have ſuch a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
wherein he might read
the nature and deſerts of his ſins.
<hi>The Child that is born unto thee
ſhall ſurely die.</hi> From whence it
may not be unuſeful to obſerve, that
God is pleaſed ſometimes to lay the
Puniſhment due to the Parents ſin
upon their Children, and ſo here
<hi>David</hi> had ſinned and the Child
muſt die for it; which may be of
great uſe and moment to make peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
more wary and deliberate how
they enter into the Holy State of
Matrimony: For though it be a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Inſtitution, and ordained of
God in Paradiſe, and the State of
Mans Innocency, yet there may be
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:137153:16"/>
ways of unhallowing Marriage, and
turning that into a ſin which was at
firſt ordained for the greateſt Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing.
For if only Intereſt, or Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
or Luſt, be the chief founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and ingredient of our Choice;
or if ſome ſinful pre-ingagement or
lewd Amours make Marriage neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
for the hiding our ſhame; or if
any of theſe things do cauſe a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract,
or make up the match, we may
expect that God in juſtice may blaſt
and curſe the fruits of our Body
for the ſin of our Soul, and for the
ſins of our fleſh too. An inſtance
whereof we have in Gods decreeing
the death of <hi>Davids</hi> Child; which
though it was born in Marriage, yet
God utterly diſlik'd the Conjunction;
the firſt occaſion and grounds there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
being laid in Adulterous Embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
<hi>David</hi> making no ſcruple to
murder the Husband that he might
obtain the Wife.</p>
            <p>But when <hi>David</hi> heard that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
ſentence againſt his Child, that
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:137153:17"/>
he ſhould ſurely die for his ſin, might
not he have confeſt himſelf altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the fault, and deſired to ſuffer
wholly himſelf, and have ſaid as
in another Caſe, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21. 17.
<hi>It is I have ſinned, and done evil
indeed, but as for</hi> this Lamb, this
Innocent Babe, <hi>what has it done?
Let thy hand be upon me, or my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Houſe, and not on</hi> this Child,
<hi>that that ſhould be plagued.</hi> I ſay,
one would think that <hi>David</hi> ſhould
have ſet himſelf to deprecate Gods
diſpleaſure againſt his Child upon
his account, and deſired to have ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained
the burthen of his own ſin:
But the ſentence was gone out, and
what was written was written, and
there was no reverſing the Decree.
And therefore all they that intend to
change their condition, and deſire
that they may leave their Inheritance
to their Children, had beſt look to
it, and have a care that they do not
make Luſt, or any ſinful Pre-ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
a Preamble and Introduction
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:137153:17"/>
to Marriage, for fear God diſappoint
them in their hopes and deſires, and
either write them Childleſs, or take
away their Children in wrath for
their folly and wickedneſs. For
though God ſpared <hi>David,</hi> and
gave him a grant of his own life,
that he ſhould not die; yet there is
no begging the life of his Child,
the Prophet reading its Deſtiny, <hi>the
Child that is born ſhall ſurely die.</hi>
So that for people to couple together
in a ſcandalous and ſinful way, and
to make Luſt the baſis and founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Marriage, is to murther their
Children in the Womb, and in a
manner to predeſtinate them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
            <p>But then when <hi>David</hi> heard that
his Child ſhould not live, but was
under a ſentence of Death, and that
according to the words of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
it preſently fell ſick and was
deſperately ill, How then did he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have
himſelf? Truly like a very kind
and indulgent Father; for it was no
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:137153:18"/>
ſooner ſtruck with ſickneſs but <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
beſought God for the Child, <hi>And
David faſted and went in and lay
all night upon the Earth, and the
Elders of the Houſe aroſe and went
to him, to raiſe him up from the
Earth, but he would not, neither
did he eat bread with them,</hi> in the
16, and 17. v. of this Chapter. Here
we ſee <hi>David</hi> in a ſad and mournful
poſture, expreſſing all the ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms
and ſigns of a mighty ſorrow,
and being earneſt in Prayer to God
for it; which if all Parents would do
the like upon the ſame occaſion when
their Children are ſick, or any ways
afflicted, they would find their
Prayers to be a more efficacious way
than all the Drugs of the Apotheca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
or the numberleſs preſcriptions of
the Phyſicians for the recovery of
their Children: <hi>For the effectual
fervent Prayer of the Righteous a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaileth
much.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But then we may conſider, that
<hi>David</hi> had great reaſon to bewail
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:137153:18"/>
the ſickneſs of the Child, as firſt, being
the effect and puniſhment of his ſin,
and ſecondly, upon the account of
natural affection.</p>
            <p>Firſt, He had a great deal of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to grieve and be troubled at the
ſickneſs of his Child, it being ſent as
a puniſhment for his own perſonal
ſin; and therefore when he ſaw it in
miſery and pain, and great anguiſh,
and conſidered that it ſuffered all
this principally for his ſake, that he
had the greateſt hand in bringing
all this trouble and ſorrow upon it,
and that he was the great Actor in
the Tragedy, and this his ſin occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion'd
this great ſcene of ſorrows:
How could he do otherwiſe than lay
the ſickneſs of it to heart, and take
on bitterly, to think that by the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi> he had caus'd the
Death of his Child, and that by
committing folly with <hi>Bathſheba,</hi> he
had brought ſuch an affliction upon
their Iſſue? I ſay, ſuch a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
muſt needs wound <hi>David</hi> to the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:137153:19"/>
very heart, and cauſe him to make
great Lamentations over the Child.
And truly the ſame ſorrows would
become even the beſt Parents, and
it might not be amiſs for them to
make ſome like Reflections. For the
Parents are generally apt to impute
the Diſtempers, the Sickneſs, the
Death of their Children, either to
want of due care in their Nurſes, or
to the badneſs of the Air, or the
unwholeſomneſs of the Seaſon, or
ill diet, or the irregular courſe of the
Phyſician; I ſay, though we are apt
to aſcribe the ſickneſs and Death of
our Children to theſe outward and
ſecondary Cauſes, yet we ſhould do
well to ſuſpect our ſins as the cauſe
of their miſery and ſufferings, and to
believe that there is ſomething more
than ordinary in the afflictions of
ſuch harmleſs and innocent Creatures.
Surely the Parents have ſin'd though
theſe poor Lambs ſuffer, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is good and convenient that
all Parents do examine themſelves,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:137153:19"/>
and ſee whether they need go any
further than themſelves to find out
the true cauſe and original of thoſe
many weakneſſes and diſtempers
which they ſee in their Children, and
for which they ſeem ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
and troubled. How mightily
are ſome Parents troubled to ſee
their Children grow crooked and
deform'd, and yet little conſider that
poſſibly their Children are the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handſomer
for their being ſo proud
of themſelves, and glorying in their
Beauty; others are griev'd to ſee
their Children prove ſuch Punies, ſo
feeble and infirm, and of ſuch a
weak Conſtitution, and do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
upon the debaucheries of their
life, and how they have loſt their
ſtrength in <hi>Dalilahs</hi> Lap. And it is a
general complaint and obſervation
that every Age declines more and
more in ſtrength and virility, and
that the latter Generation of men are
dwindled almoſt into Pigmies in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon
of what they were formerly,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:137153:20"/>
and yet men do little conſider, that
Luxury and riotous Living may be
aſſigned as the grand Cauſes and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of this great Degeneracy. And
we alſo ſee that new and ſtrange Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes
do creep up daily and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
and invade humane Bodies, and
yet we ſeldom impute theſe decays
and breakings of nature to the vices
of our Progenitors.</p>
            <p>Whereas we have juſt reaſon to
grieve at the ſight of thoſe many
Diſeaſes which attend our Children,
and thoſe great infirmities which they
often labour under, and the more
reaſon to be humbled when we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
upon our ſelves as the Authors
of them. The truth is, we have laid
a train of miſchiefs in our Bodies by
our Vices, which will certainly ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine
and blow up our Children; we
have Created Diſeaſes in our Bodies
by treſpaſſing too much upon na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and offering great violencies
to our Conſtitution; we have bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
and ſhattered our Bodies by
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:137153:20"/>
great exceſs, by hard and unſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Drinkings, and that may be one
reaſon why we deliver down ſuch a
weak and craſie Progeny. We have
turn'd our Bodies into Bogs of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs
and putrefaction, by our
luſt and wantonneſs, and that may
be a very proper reaſon why our
Children carry about them ſuch an
Hoſpital of Diſeaſes. We have made
our Bodies Sepulchres and burying
places of Wine, and that may be
another reaſon why our Children
become Corpſes ſo ſoon, and go ſo
early to their Graves; we eat and
drink deſtruction to our Children by
our Gluttony and Drunkenneſs, we
dig their Graves as well as our own
with our Teeth, and by ſwallowing
down over-much, we prepare them
for the devoration of the Worms;
and 'tis not any whit probable or
likely, that our Children ſhould
prove ſound and healthful, when
we diſtemper our Bodies, and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
up Diſeaſes. And we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:137153:21"/>
that we do propagate Diſeaſes
many times as well as our nature,
and there are Diſeaſes which (our
Poſterity find by woful experience)
run in a blood; And therefore
it is the duty of all Parents who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
the good of their Poſterity, and
have a regard to the welfare and
happineſs of their Children, to be
very ſtrict and punctual in obſerving
the Rules of temperance and ſobrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and in keeping their Bodies pure
and undefil'd; foraſmuch as by a
vicious and debaucht life we ſtore
up Diſeaſes for Poſterity, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
great evils to our Generation.
For 'tis certain, that by great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes
and impure mixtures we do
corrupt our bloud, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
muſt convey a taint to our Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring,
and a rotten Father ſeldom
produces any other than a Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Child; and beſides, our Vices
are as communicable to our Children
as our Diſeaſes, and who knows but
that God might determine to take
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:137153:21"/>
away <hi>Davids</hi> Child for this very
reaſon, leſt he ſhould <hi>Patriſſare</hi> take
after his Father, he being the Child
of an Incontinent Father, and the
Iſſue of ſuch unhallowed Embraces.
And therefore when <hi>David</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voting
his Enemies, he makes this
one of his dreadful Curſes, <hi>Let
the iniquity of his Father be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred
with the Lord, and let
not the ſin of his Mother be blotted
out,</hi> in the 119. <hi>Pſ.</hi> and 14. <hi>v.</hi> And
truly I fear that there are too many
ungodly Fathers and Mothers in the
World, whoſe wickedneſs and folly
is ſuch, as that their Children ſuffer
for it deeply, being cover'd with
Sores and Boils, and having ſuch
Diſeaſes breaking forth as are plain
marks and tokens of their Parents
ſins. God viſiting <hi>the iniquities of
the Fathers upon the Children, and
not ſuffering the iniquity of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to be conceal'd, nor the ſin of
the Mother to be blotted out.</hi> And
therefore thoſe Parents that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:137153:22"/>
to themſelves of any ſuch great
and foul ſin as <hi>Davids</hi> was, have very
great reaſon to lament the Diſeaſes
and Death of their Children, when
they conſider, that they themſelves
were the great Inſtruments of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all thoſe miſeries upon their
Children, and that their ſins have
had the greateſt hand in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.
And 'tis very well worth
our obſervation, that in the firſt Age
of the World it was never ſeen that
the Son died before the Father, but
the oldeſt always went firſt: But then
when the wickedneſs of men grew
great, and their Pride ſo great that
they were too high for their Station,
and would needs be building Caſtles
in the Air, and climbing up to the
Battlements of Heaven, it hapned
preſently afterwards that <hi>Terahs</hi> Son
died before his Father, and there is
a ſpecial note and mark ſet upon it
as a kind of wonder, in the 9. of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſis</hi>
and 28. <hi>v. And Haran died
before his Father Terah in the Land
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:137153:22"/>
of his Nativity.</hi> From whence we
may obſerve, that the wickedneſs
of a Father is enough to alter the
courſe of nature, and to ſhorten his
Childrens days, and to accelerate
their Death, and bring them to the
duſt before their time. And thus I
have been ſomewhat long on this
Argument, that I might repreſent to
you the danger of a ſinning Father
and Mother, and what a fatal miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
they do their Children by their
wickedneſs, in that they bring a
Curſe upon their Family, and by
their ſin occaſion the Death and ruin
of an Innocent Child; as is clear
and manifeſt in this one inſtance of
<hi>Davids</hi> Child being taken away
for the ſin of his Father. And we
may alſo remember what a greivous
Curſe God entailed upon old <hi>Eli</hi>'s
Family and Poſterity, that they
ſhould die in the Flower of their Age,
and be cut off in their very prime,
and that chiefly upon the account
of old <hi>Eli.</hi> And therefore Parents
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:137153:23"/>
had need take a care to pleaſe God,
and that they do commit no great
offence, and to keep from great
tranſgreſſions, that ſo their Children
may not repent that ever they were
born of them, and ſuffer ſadly for
their miſcarriages. And indeed all
Parents that deſire it ſhould be well
with their Children, and that they
ſhould live long and ſee good days,
are concern'd to live a pure and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotted
life, to poſſeſs their Veſſels
in ſanctification and honour, not in
the luſt of Concupiſence, otherwiſe
they may bring great miſeries upon
their Children, and perhaps a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
Death; and if they are reſolv'd
to continue their debaucheries and
lewd Amours, they had even as
good ſtrangle their Children when
they are newly born, and it may be
a mercy to tear them in pieces as
<hi>Medea</hi> did her Brother <hi>Abſyrtus,</hi>
rather than they ſhould live to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit
their Phthiſicks, Conſumptions,
and loathſome Diſeaſes, and to be
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:137153:23"/>
plagu'd all their life long with the
miſerable effects of their Parents
ſins. And truly all vitious and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly
Parents have the ſame grounds
that <hi>David</hi> had to lament over their
Children when they ſhall ſee them
ſick of their Diſeaſes, conſuming
with their Luſts, and expiring un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the curſe of their ſins. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if Parents would but take care
to live better, and more vertuouſly,
poſſibly their Children would not
prove ſo ſickly, and might live lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger;
for 'tis certain, that <hi>Davids</hi>
Child was ſick, and died ſo ſoon, for
the wickedneſs of the Father.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Davids</hi> great grief and
mourning for his Child, during the
time of its ſickneſs, was very juſt
and reaſonable upon another ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
as being an expreſſion of
humanity, and the reſult of a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
affection.</p>
            <p>For our Religion has not like the
Stoick ſeal'd up the fountain of tears,
and wip'd them away from our eyes,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:137153:24"/>
whilſt we are in this bitter <hi>Achor</hi>
and Valley of tears; but has given
us liberty to vent our ſorrows, and
eaſe the inward griefs of our mind in
a reaſonable meaſure, according to
the proportions of humanity, and ſo
far as is conſiſtent with, and not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory
to our Chriſtian hope; and
therefore as to grieve immoderately
is unlike a Chriſtian, ſo not to grieve
at all is unlike a man: ſo that <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi>
ſorrowing for his Child when
he ſaw it in pain and anguiſh, was
but a reaſonable paſſion, becoming
him as a man, in ſympathizing with
the ſufferings of humane nature, and
much more becoming him as he
ſtood in the relation of a Father,
whoſe Bowels, if he had any, muſt
needs move and yearn over a ſick
and languiſhing Child. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it was no ſuch real matter of
wonder, as the Spectators of <hi>Davids</hi>
ſorrows thought it, to ſee him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volv'd
in tears, and making his Bed
on the ground, and acting the part
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:137153:24"/>
of a true Mourner, whilſt his Child
was alive; for he ſaw it reſtleſs, and
tumbling up and down for eaſe, and
could find none; he ſaw it in great
pain and anguiſh, and that there was
no helping of it; he ſaw that Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians
were of no value, and all they
could do could do no good; he ſaw
the Child lie panting and heaving,
and bemoaning it ſelf with ſighs and
groans that were unutterable; he
ſaw it in ſore conflicts and ſtrugling
for life, and in the pangs and Agonies
of Death; and how could a Father
forbear weeping and making great
Lamentations over a Child in ſuch
a deplorable and ſad condition? He
ſaw alſo the Mother wringing of her
hands, and beating her Breaſt, and
with floods of tears running down
her Cheeks, and crying out, <hi>What
ſhall I do for my Child? Lord ſpare
my Child, Lord be merciful to my
Child:</hi> He ſaw likewiſe the Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants
that ſtood about not well able
to endure the room, for the hollow
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:137153:25"/>
ſighs and ſobs, and the piercing
groans of a Child that was drawing
on, and breathing out its laſt. And
laſtly, he ſaw the ſervants of his
Houſe very much clouded, and hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
down, and going mourning and
heavily, <hi>&amp; quis talia fando, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peret
à lachrymis?</hi> Who can poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
forbear weeping almoſt at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſal
of ſuch a large ſcene of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows?
How could a Father reſtrain
his tears when he beheld his own
fleſh and blood, and Bone of his
Bone, to be in ſuch great affliction?
How could he endure to ſee his own
Bowels torn from him without a
deep and ſorrowful reſentment?
How could he look upon a Child,
an Innocent Child, rowling about
in ſo much pain and torment, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
being <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, heavy and
ſorrowful, even to Death? Would
it not melt a heart of ſtone, and
draw tears from a marble to behold
ſuch a ſpectacle of pain and miſery?
And therefore <hi>Davids</hi> taking on ſo
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:137153:25"/>
heavily for his Child in the time of
its ſickneſs, was very reaſonable and
juſtifiable too; foraſmuch as tears
are the natural tribute which we pay
to the ſufferings of Mankind, and
much more do we owe them to our
Friends and Relations, and our dear
Children, and ſuch as are part of
our ſelves.</p>
            <p>But then, if <hi>David</hi> was ſuch a
man of ſorrows, and took on ſo
grievouſly for his Child in the time
of its ſickneſs, and whilſt it was yet
alive, ſurely we may expect to find
him in a deſperate condition and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to ſink into the Grave with it,
when he heard of its departure.
Certainly, he that was ſo much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
to ſee his Child in pain, muſt be
in the greateſt Agonies of ſorrow
when he hears it is dead. He that
could not endure to ſee it in miſery,
how will he bear the loſs of it? He
that was ready to kill himſelf with
grief for his Child when he was ſick,
ſurely cannot live when he is dead
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:137153:26"/>
and gone, and paſt all recovery.
This was that indeed which his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
and all that were about him
expected. They ſuppoſed, ſeeing
their Maſter had laid the ſickneſs
of the Child ſo much to heart, that
he would be in ſtrange confuſions,
and refuſe to be comforted when he
heard of its Death. But there was
no ſuch thing, the Scene is much al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
and chang'd, and the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his ſervants is much deceived:
for inſtead of extream mourning for
the Child when it was dead, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
to revive and take heart, and
falls to his meat, and takes thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhments
which he had lately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd.
Which action and carriage of
<hi>David</hi> ſhew'd very ſtrange and a
wonder to his Servants in the 21. <hi>v.</hi>
But he preſently removes the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and tells them the reaſon why
he mourn'd no longer, but rather
rejoyced at the news of the Childs
Death. <hi>And he ſaid, While the Child
was yet alive I faſted and wept,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:137153:26"/>
for I ſaid, Who can tell, whether
the Lord will be gracious to me that
the Child may live? but now he is
dead, wherefore ſhould I faſt? can
I bring him back again? I ſhall go
to him but he ſhall not return to
me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In which expreſſions <hi>David</hi> does
ſignify and declare the reaſons why
his carriage upon the Death of his
Child differ'd ſo much from what it
was when it was ſick, and yet alive.
<hi>For I ſaid, who can tell whether
the Lord will be gracious to me
that the Child may live?</hi> that is,
though the Child be deſperately
ill and paſt all hopes as to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
appearance, yet who knows
but God may hear my Prayers for
him, if they be made with true fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
and devotion, with zeal and
integrity? Who can tell but upon
my humble Petition and earneſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion
for the Child, God may
ſpare him to me, and give a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
grant of his life, and recal the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:137153:27"/>
black Sentence and Warrant for his
Death, if there be ſuch a due appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
made to him? For whilſt
there is life there is hopes, and there
is mercy always with God, that he
may be feared and ſupplicated unto,
and therefore it may be expedient
and uſeful to continue my Prayers
and to proceed in my penitential
ſorrows. And thus did <hi>David</hi> argue
the reaſonableneſs of his ſorrowing
and humbling himſelf before God
for the Child whilſt it was yet
alive.</p>
            <p>And truly it would be an excellent
and laudable thing in all Parents to
follow this Example of <hi>David,</hi> ſo
as to betake themſelves to Prayer, and
to uſe the deepeſt humiliation when
their Relations and Children happen
to be under the rod and hand of an
afflicting Providence; for there is
no ſuch effectual means for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
as a hearty and ſincere Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.
<hi>For the effectual fervent Prayer
of the righteous availeth much,</hi> ſaith
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:137153:27"/>
St. <hi>James</hi> in the 5. <hi>c.</hi> and 16. <hi>v.</hi> There
is more vertue and efficacy in Prayer
than we are ready to believe, and
they have a more ſoveraign power
to cure all maladies than the beſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions:
This is the <hi>Panaceavera,</hi>
and the great Catholicon, ſurpaſſing
all thoſe of humane Art and Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which ſome have ſo vainly
boaſted to find out. Prayer is the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal
Remedy, and has perform'd
greater Cures, and greater Recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and done greater wonders than
all the <hi>Elixirs,</hi> or <hi>Proprietates,</hi> or
<hi>Noſtrums</hi> of the moſt skilful and
renown'd Phyſicians. It was Prayer
that reſtored <hi>Hezekiah</hi> from a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
ſickneſs, and prolong'd his
Days; it was Prayer which ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<hi>David</hi> under all his troubles, and
gave him eaſe in his greateſt extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities;
it was Prayer that opened
the eyes of the blind, and ejected
the Devils, and did the moſt glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
things to all Admiration: and
therefore we muſt apply our ſelves
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:137153:28"/>
to God, and depend upon our Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
as the moſt proper and ſpecifick
remedy in afflictions. We muſt be
fervent, and frequent, and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
in Prayers to God on the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half
of our Friends and Relations,
and who can tell whether God will
be gracious to us that our Friends
may live.</p>
            <p>But then may ſome reply and ſay,
it was in vain for <hi>David</hi> to uſe
Prayer or any other means; it was
to no purpoſe for him to expect the
recovery of his Child, or that God
ſhould anſwer him though he pray'd
never ſo much. For he knew that
God had decreed the Death of his
Child, and told him in as plain
words as could be, by his Prophet,
that the Child ſhould ſurely die; and
why then ſhould <hi>David</hi> flatter him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
ſo as to imagine that he could do
the Child any good by his Prayers,
or prevail with God for his Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very?
Why ſhould he uſe that du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bious
Language, as, <hi>who can tell,</hi>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:137153:28"/>
'tis poſſible, or it may be that <hi>the
Lord will be gracious to me that
the Child may live?</hi> Why ſhould
he ſtand doubting or ſuppoſing a
poſſibility of a thing, when God had
poſitively declared the contrary?</p>
            <p>To which I Anſwer, That God
declared by his Prophet <hi>Jonah,</hi> the
deſtruction of the <hi>Ninevites,</hi> and
prefixt the time to juſt forty days, and
this was declared with as great poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiveneſs
as the Death of <hi>Davids</hi>
Child by the Prophet <hi>Nathan,</hi> and
the Prophet <hi>Jonah try'd and ſaid,
Yet forty days and Nineveh ſhall be
overthrown,</hi> in the 3. of <hi>Jonah</hi> and
4. <hi>v.</hi> and yet after the delivery and
promulgation of this ſentence, the
<hi>Ninevites</hi> did not deſpond, or ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
deſpair of Gods mercy, but fell
to repentance and humbling them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and put the ſucceſs to the ſame
venture that <hi>David</hi> did, and much in
the ſame Language, ſaying in the 9. <hi>v.
Who can tell if God will return and
repent, and turn away from his
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:137153:29"/>
fierce anger, that we periſh not?</hi>
And what was the Iſſue of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
and Humiliation, and uſing
the beſt means they could to divert
Gods Judgments? Why the Iſſue was,
that by their Repentance they ſtav'd
off the judgment and put it back, as
we may ſee in the 10. and laſt <hi>ver.
And God ſaw their works, that they
turned from their evil ways, and
God repented of the evil that he
had ſaid, that he would do unto
them, and did it not.</hi> And ſo
in the 20. <hi>Ch.</hi> of the 2. of <hi>Kings,</hi>
God ordered the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> to
go and carry to <hi>Hezekiah</hi> the ſame
meſſage of Death, and to acquaint
him that he muſt expect no other
than Death. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord,
Set thine Houſe in order, for thou
ſhalt die, and not live:</hi> Could any
thing be more abſolute and poſitive
than theſe words? and yet <hi>Hezekiah</hi>
inſtead of melancholizing himſelf
with the thoughts of Death, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting
it every hour, <hi>turned his
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:137153:29"/>
face to the Wall, and prayed unto
the Lord, ſaying, I beſeech thee, O
Lord, remember now how I have
walked before thee in truth, and
with a perfect heart, and have done
that which is good in thy ſight: and
Hezekiah wept ſore,</hi> in the 3. <hi>ver.</hi>
And what good, will you ſay, could
<hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s praying, and weeping,
and appealing to the Righteouſneſs
of his life do him? Could that or any
thing elſe ſave him and prevent his
dying, when God had ſo ſolemnly
Decreed? yes truly his Prayer and
Repentance did him ſo much good,
as to prevail with God to grant him
a longer Leaſe of his life; and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
the ſame Prophet that had juſt
now told him of his Death, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
forthwith and acquaint him
alſo that he had reverſt the fatal ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence:
<hi>Turn again, and tell Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah
the Captain of my people, Thus
ſaith the Lord, the God of David
thy Father, I have heard thy Prayer,
I have ſeen thy tears: behold, I
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:137153:30"/>
will heal thee; on the third day
thou ſhalt go up unto the Houſe of
the Lord. And I will add unto thy
days fifteen years.</hi> What then ſhall
we ſay, that there is any change in
the Divine Decrees, or any incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy
in God, or that he is worſe
than his word, when he thus poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
denounces judgment, and yet
ſuſpends it? <hi>God forbid,</hi> ſays the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle,
<hi>yea let God be true, but eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man a lyar, as it is written, that
thou mighteſt be juſtified in thy
ſayings.</hi> And therefore for the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of God from all imputation of
falſhood or mutability in theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
of his judgments denounced
againſt ſinners without any actual
execution, we are to underſtand that
thoſe threatnings of God in Scripture,
which run in an abſolute form, have
a condition imply'd, that is, <hi>Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veh
ſhall be deſtroyed, and Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah
ſhall die except they repent:</hi>
So that God does ſtill reſerve a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of revocation, and puts in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:137153:30"/>
clauſe of repentance, which
though it be not expreſt, yet is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
to be underſtood; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
where Gods threatnings of death
and deſtruction ſeem moſt perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and final, we are yet to attempt
the diverting and preventing them
by our Prayers and repentance; we
are to uſe the means, and as we ſay,
leave the ſucceſs to God: For who
knows but the Lord may be gracious?
But if God will not hear our Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
nor accept our Repentance, as
he did neither in the preſent Caſe of
<hi>Davids</hi> Child; yet we are to uſe
the moſt proper means, and to try
all the ways imaginable to pacify
Gods anger, and to appeaſe his
wrath, and ſtill to go on praying and
repenting as <hi>David</hi> did. We are not
to deſpond of mercy, or to deſpair
of ſucceſs, but at the very laſt puſh,
and the utmoſt extremity of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to ſay, <hi>who can tell but the
Lord will be gracious?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus I have delivered to you
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:137153:31"/>
the juſt reaſons why <hi>David</hi> mourn'd
ſo exceedingly for his Child when it
lay upon a Bed of ſickneſs, and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing:
As firſt, conſidering that
his own ſin was the chief and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
cauſe of his Childs grievous and
deſperate ſickneſs; and ſecondly,
upon the account of that natural af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
which is in all Parents to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
their Children, which moves
their bowels to pity and bewail
them when they are in miſery and
diſtreſs.</p>
            <p>But then the great wonder is, that
the Father which was ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
and deeply immerſt in ſorrow
for the ſickneſs of his Child, ſhould
give over mourning upon the death
and loſs of it; that his ſorrow ſhould
expire and be at an end as ſoon as
the Child was departed, and had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
up the Ghoſt. <hi>But now he is
dead, why ſhould I faſt?</hi> Why
ſhould I trouble and grieve my ſelf
any longer? But how oddly and
ſtrangely, may ſome ſay, doth this
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:137153:31"/>
look in a Father, to dry his Eyes,
and clear up his Countenance pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
upon the death and loſs of his
Child? Is not this a thing out of
courſe, and a very ſtrange temper,
to ſorrow ſo much for the Child
when it was ſick, and to ceaſe ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing
when it was abſolutely dead
and gone? Surely, this giving over
mourning at the death of ſo near and
dear a Relation as a Child, muſt
needs proceed fromhard-heartedneſs,
or the want of natural affection and
of common humanity.</p>
            <p>But then we may obſerve, that
<hi>David</hi> both to excuſe and juſtifie
his not mourning for the Death of
his Child, nor taking on ſo grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly
as he did before, alledges theſe
good and ſubſtantial reaſons, as firſt,
The conſideration of the neceſſity
of his own dying; and ſecondly, The
impoſſibility of his Childs coming
to life again. And we may alſo ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
that he had ſome further conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations
at that time, which helpt
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:137153:32"/>
to allay and ſilence his ſorrows, as
namely Firſt, the conſideration of
the Childs dying in its Age of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency.
Secondly, That it was gone
out of a wicked and troubleſome
World. Thirdly, That it was freed
from thoſe pains, and ſickneſſes, and
diſeaſes, which are incident to this
mortal condition. Fourthly, That
it was releaſed from thoſe pains and
miſeries which it underwent: And
fifthly, That it was the will of God
it ſhould be ſo. And it is but very
reaſonable to imagine, that all theſe
conſiderations, though not verbally
expreſt, might occur to <hi>Davids</hi>
mind, or any mans elſe upon the
like emergency.</p>
            <p>I begin with the firſt conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that put a ſtop to <hi>Davids</hi> ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for the loſs of his Child, and
that was the neceſſity of his own
dying. <hi>Can I bring him back again?
I ſhall go to him. David</hi> conſidered
that Death was common to all, and
that 'tis appointed for all men once
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:137153:32"/>
to die: <hi>What man is he that liveth
and ſhall not ſee death?</hi> in the 89.
<hi>Pſ.</hi> and 48. <hi>v. And I know,</hi> ſays
Job, <hi>that thou wilt bring me to
death, and to the Houſe appointed
for all the living;</hi> and ſo <hi>David</hi>
was convinced that he muſt as ſurely
die as he was then alive, and that life
is but a ſhort preamble to death, and
why then ſhould he grieve and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
himſelf for the loſs of his Child,
when nothing had hapned to that
but what muſt alſo happen to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
and to all men living? For he
was only gone the way of all fleſh,
and had paid that debt to Nature,
which every one muſt do at one
time or other, ſooner or later. His
Child indeed was dead, but that
was but a common, natural and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable
thing, and the beaten
road to the Grave, and the uſual
way of going out of the World. He
conſidered wiſely with himſelf that
his Child was only gone before him,
and that he muſt prepare to follow;
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:137153:33"/>
that his death indeed was ſomewhat
early and immature and ſooner than
ordinary; but the Father muſt not
ſtay long behind. He ſaw that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
the buds and bloſſoms were
nipt and fell to the ground, and
that ripe fruit would certainly drop
off; He obſerved that ſometimes
the Lambs went to the ſlaughter, and
that there was no eſcaping for the
old Sheep; And therefore it was in
vain to be troubled at a thing which
was paſt and gone and could not be
helpt, and which all muſt ſubmit to,
young and old, the Father as well
as the Child.</p>
            <p>And what though it was a Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Babe, and Heir to a Crown, and
if it had liv'd might have been va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued
at as great a rate as his Father,
worth ten thouſand of the ordinary
ſort of people; yet Death was no
reſpecter of perſons, makes no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction,
and takes the ignoble and
noble, the Prince and the Peaſant,
and ſweeps away all alike; 'tis not a
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:137153:33"/>
Crown or a great Inheritance that
will purchaſe life, or deliver from
Death; 'tis not a high deſcent or
being of the Royal Blood, that will
priviledge or exempt from the Grave.
But <hi>David</hi> himſelf muſt ſurrender
up and lay down his Scepter at the
ſummons of the King of Terrours,
which had ſo lately cut off and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
his Sons Inheriting the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Glory; the branch is now lopt
off, and ere long the root will be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
up and carried away. And
therefore 'tis not long, ſays <hi>David,</hi>
before I ſhall go to the ſame place, and
be laid equal with my Child in the
duſt. He has only made the firſt han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel
of my Tomb, and taken the firſt
poſſeſſion of my Grave. He has had
the misfortune, or rather priviledge,
to go before me, but I am going
apace to meet him. He was ſnatcht
away betimes, and I only wait Gods
leiſure, and look when my change
will come, and expect every day to
be called away; and therefore I do
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:137153:34"/>
not think it reaſonable to imbitter
this ſhort life, or to make my ſelf
uneaſy and uncomfortable the reſt
of my days, by a great and violent
ſorrow for the loſs of my Child;
when I know that I have not much
longer to live, and that the days of
my Pilgrimage will ſhortly be at an
end, and that his condition will
ſhortly be mine, and we ſhall both
meet together in the Grave, and be
fellow Lodgers in the Duſt, and
ſleep together in the ſame Chambers
of Darkneſs; and therefore, ſays <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi>
why ſhould I faſt? why ſhould
I macerate and waſt my ſelf? why
ſhould I grieve and pine away? why
ſhould I go and throw away my life in
ſorrowing for the Death of my Child,
when I know that all the ſorrow in
the World will do no good? and that
my Child has paſſed thoſe Gates of
Death, which I my ſelf muſt after a
little while ſtrive and ſtruggle to get
thorough, and that he is now in his
Grave out of which I cannot keep
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:137153:34"/>
long; <hi>and why then ſhould I faſt?
can I bring him back again? I
ſhall go to him, but he ſhall not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But he ſhall not return to me.</hi>
That's another Conſideration which
might well ſerve to pacify <hi>Davids</hi>
ſorrow and diſcontent at the loſs of
his Child; namely, the impoſſibility
of its coming to life again, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
to the ſame condition as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly.
<hi>I ſhall go to him, but he ſhall
not return to me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Death is that which puts a perfect
and abſolute end to this preſent life,
and when we are committed to the
Duſt and laid up in the Grave, there
is no breaking forth, no expecting
our liberty or enlargement till the
day of the general Reſurrection. <hi>We
are Priſoners of hope,</hi> ſayes the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
that is, though we have a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
and aſſurance of our riſing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
and being delivered from the
Grave, yet ſtill we are Priſoners till
the time of our Redemption comes,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:137153:35"/>
and conſequently muſt remain in
hold, and under the ſtrict cuſtody
and durance of the Grave. Death is
a total privation of life, and <hi>à tota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li
Privatione ad habitum non da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur
regreſſus,</hi> our Philoſophy tells
us, that is, though it be poſſible to
recover the ſight when the Organ of
the Eye is only inflam'd or diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd,
or grown over with a film;
yet when a man is ſtark blind, and
his Eyes are dropt out of his Head,
then ſuch a recovery is utterly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible:
and ſo Death being a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
privation of motion, ſenſation, and
all the acts of the animal life, there
is no returning after that has once
paſs'd upon us, to any ſuch vital ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
we are, ſays the Prophet
<hi>Samuel, 2 Sam.</hi> 14. and 14. <hi>ver.
as water ſpilt upon the ground,
which cannot be gathered up again,</hi>
that is, as Water ſpilt upon the
ground preſently vaniſhes out of
ſight, and ſinks into the Earth, and
by the diffluence of its parts is ſo
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:137153:35"/>
diſperſt and waſted that there is no
gathering it up again in the ſame
quantity that it fell; ſo Death cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
ſuch a diſſolution of the parts of
our Bodies, that there is no reuniting
them in the ſame manner, or forming
them into the ſame orderly lively Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick
by all the power and art in the
World. <hi>Can theſe dry bones live,</hi>
ſays the Prophet, is a Queſtion that
might very well be askt, as being a
thing almoſt incredible, but that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is impoſſible with God. But
then how is it that theſe dry bones
will live? ſurely not in the ſame way
as formerly, nor can they be enli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened
by any humane power or
Art, but they ſhall be quickned by
a miraculous power, by the ſame
power which raiſed <hi>Jeſus</hi> from the
Dead; but at preſent, during the
time and reign of mortality, they
muſt remain rotten, and ſhatter'd,
and liveleſs, and only in a poſſibility
to return to life by the wonderful
power of God in the Morning of
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:137153:36"/>
the Reſurrection. And <hi>Job</hi> in the 24.
<hi>c.</hi> and 14. <hi>v.</hi> asks much the ſame
queſtion, <hi>If a man die, ſhall he live
again?</hi> where <hi>Job</hi> does not ſo much
doubt or queſtion the truth of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection,
as puts it out of all doubt
by ſo propounding it; <hi>if a man die,
ſhall he live?</hi> yes, he ſhall, but not
by any power of nature to reſtore
it ſelf, nor that there is any remains
of ſpirit in man after death which
can quicken into new life of its own
accord, nor that there is any ſeed of
immortality in humane Bodies, as
ſome of the Jews did fondly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
when they imputed the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection
to the vertue of a Worm
in the back-bone which never dies:
And therefore though we are to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
another life, yet we muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it in another place; For when
our life here is once expir'd, there is
no return of it, till God breath into
us a new ſpirit of life, and inſpire us
with new vigour and motion. And
therefore pray'd in another place, that
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:137153:36"/>
God would continue his life a little
longer upon Earth, as verily belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
he ſhould never ſee it any more
when he had once left it; <hi>Spare me,
O Lord, a little longer, before I go
hence, and be no more ſeen, Pſ.</hi> 39.
and 13. <hi>v. Man,</hi> ſayes <hi>Solomon, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to his long home, and the mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
go about the ſtreets,</hi> long in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
whence there will be no
moving or ſtirring a foot till the
great day of Judgment. And not
improper to our purpoſe is that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
of the Fox in the Fable,
who when he was much urg'd and
importun'd to go and pay a Viſit to
the Lyon in the time of his ſickneſs,
and told, that his Company would
be more uſeful and ſerviceable to the
Lyon, in order to the helping him
to make his will, as being one fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
for his wiſdom and ſagacity;
anſwered, by no means, for there was
a great deal of danger in going to
viſit this King of Beaſts; For he had
obſerv'd a great reſort to the Lyon,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:137153:37"/>
but ſaw no marks or footſteps of any
that ever return'd from him. <hi>Veſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia
nulla retrorſum;</hi> and ſo may we
ſay, that we have known millions
that have enter'd into the ſhades be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
but none that ever came back
from thence; and therefore we find,
that when <hi>Dives</hi> was in torment, and
made this earneſt requeſt to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
that one might riſe from the
dead and inform his Brethren of the
truth of Hell torments, and by
ſuch a wonderful information might
ſcare them from doing any thing
that might bring them thither;
yet this requeſt was denied him upon
this account, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7. and 9. <hi>v.</hi> there
being ſo great a publication of a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
State by <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets
and other divine teſtimonies; and
beſides, <hi>Abraham</hi> told him, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
us and you there is a great
Gulf fixed, which place is enough to
evince the impoſſibility of a return
to this World after Death; and
therefore we imagin, that <hi>David</hi> at
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:137153:37"/>
the parting of his Child took his final
leave of him, bidding him an Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
farewel, and an Everlaſting good
night. For he conſidered that there
was no hopes of ſeeing him again
under the ſame circumſtances, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing
with him in the fleſh; and
therefore having decently commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
his Body to the ground, and laid
him in the boſom of our common
Mother Earth, and perhaps dropping
a tear or two upon the Hearſe, and
beſprinkling the Grave with tears, as
our Saviour did <hi>Lazarus</hi> in teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
how much he lov'd him, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tires
from the Funeral with great So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity
we may imagine, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any further Lamentations, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>wherefore ſhould I faſt? can I
bring him back again? I ſhall go
to him, but he ſhall not return to
me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But then perhaps ſeveral may be
ready to tax this Diſcourſe with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinency,
and ſay, what needs
there all this ſtir and ado to prove a
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:137153:38"/>
thing that never was gainſaid or
contradicted? as namely, the impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility
of the dead coming to life
again, and riſing out of their Graves
to live anew in this World: who is
ſo ſilly or credulous as to expect ſuch
a thing? or who would deſire to
ſee the Ghoſts, or any repreſentations
of their Friends when they are dead
and gone?</p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, That I believe
there is none ſo ſilly, or whimſical, or
deeply melancholy, as to expect a
return of their Friends and Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
from the Grave. But then peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
make a great Argument againſt
themſelves, and do highly condemn
themſelves of the greateſt folly in
their inordinate ſorrowings for the
Dead. For why ſhould they take on
and weep ſo bitterly for the loſs of
a Child or Relation, when they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
no ſuch thing as a return from
Death? why do they wound them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with ſuch mighty and piercing
ſorrows for their Relations, when
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:137153:38"/>
they know they are dead and gone,
and that there is no hopes of ſeeing
them again as long as the World en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures?
This indeed is their folly to
grieve for an irrecoverable loſs, and
to weep inceſſantly at the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of deceaſed Friends. For tis
the vaineſt, idleſt thing that can be,
to mourn when all the mourning in
the World will do no good, neither
to us or our Friends; and therefore
this conſideration, that all our tears
are in vain and ineffectual, and that
they may be ſpent as well upon a
dead Tree as a dead Child, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
one as ſoon as the other, may
ſerve to ſuppreſs all the extravagant
ſorrowings of all perſons for their
Friends and Relations, and make
them argue with themſelves the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonableneſs
of all ſuch deſperate
mourning, ſaying with <hi>David,</hi> now
they are dead why ſhould we faſt
and take on ſo grievouſly, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
to be comforted, as <hi>Rachel,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
our Children or our Friends
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:137153:39"/>
are not? For to what purpoſe is all
our weeping, and mourning, and
caſting down our ſelves? can we bring
them back again? no, that's utterly
impoſſible, we ſhall go to them very
ſpeedily, and follow them cloſe into
their Graves, but there is no expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to ſee them any more: they ſhall
not return to us.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Another thing which
might well ſtop <hi>Davids</hi> ſorrowing
for his Child, might be this Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
That his Child died in its
innocent time, and before it came
to the Age of ſinning.</p>
            <p>For though it be a great happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to have our Children live and
grow up to be Men and Women, to
ſee them ripen to the perfect uſe of
reaſon, and to arrive at years of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion;
though it be a ſingular
comfort and honour to Parents to
ſee their Children grow eminent for
Piety and Wiſdom, and to become
the great Lights and Ornaments of
their Generation; yet the great un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happineſs
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:137153:39"/>
in breeding up Children is
this, that Parents are not ſure of
their Childrens Inclinations to ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.
And they are not certain
though they give them the beſt Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
in the World, but that they
may make an ill uſe of it, and turn
the edge of their wits againſt God
and Vertue, and only prove more
ingeniouſly wicked, and great Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
in Debauchery. For good E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation
does not always and infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly
make good men; and though
our Children are ſometimes very
hopeful when they are young, and
give great preſages and ſpecimens of
virtuous diſpoſitions, yet their incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
are as uncertain as wind, and
as unſtable as water in that ſlippery
Age, and 'tis a thouſand to one but
that when they come from under the
Diſcipline of the Rod and <hi>Ferula,</hi>
and are left more to their own li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
and have the reins laid looſe
upon their Necks; 'tis then, I ſay,
very great odds, but they will prove
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:137153:40"/>
contrary to expectation, and the by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſs
of their inclinations be turn'd
a wrong way. For whoever ſhall
conſider the flexibility of youth, and
how eaſily it is ſeduced and led aſide
by bad Examples and great tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
which do every where abound
in the World, cannot but think it
a Miracle of Grace for youth to keep
upright and unſpotted from the
World. It may indeed much fortify
and preſerve youth againſt the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults
and flatteries of Vice, to be
ſeaſon'd with good and vertuous
Principles: But if they are never ſo
carefully Educated, and religiouſly
brought up, yet when they come
freſh and green into the World, they
are ready to be bent any way, and
moſt likely to lean to the wrong
ſide, and to ſtand according to the
bent of corrupt nature.</p>
            <p>But queſtionleſs good Education
will go a great way in making a good
man, and has a great ſtroke and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
upon the ſucceeding part of
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:137153:40"/>
our life. But yet 'tis but a common
ſuppoſition, that that Vertue which
was ſo ſecure and flouriſhing when
it was confin'd within Walls and out
of the reach of temptations, may be
in great hazard and danger when it
comes abroad, and to live in the
Air, and within the breath of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.
For a Cloyſter may ſecure
that Vertue which perhaps would
be loſt if it walkt at large, and a
School may ſend forth a good Lad,
which perhaps Liberty and Company
may corrupt and ſpoil. So that there
is no depending upon or aſſurance
of our Childrens Vertue whilſt they
are young, and before they come to
the Regions of Choice, and make
ſome experiment of themſelves, how
tenacious they are of Vertue, and
how much they can hold out againſt
the great and ſuitable temptations
that are in the World; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we are very fond and fooliſh
to promiſe to our ſelves great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
from our Children, or to build
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:137153:41"/>
over-much upon their future Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
and to pleaſe our ſelves with
thinking what rare men they will
make, and what great Comforts they
will prove to us; whereas we know
not what great alterations time may
produce, and what years may bring
forth. For although we may dote
upon our Children when they are
young, as <hi>David</hi> did upon his Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<hi>Adonijah,</hi> and applaud their
Inclinations, yet they may get to
head, and grow Maſterleſs, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient
and incorrigible as <hi>Adoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah</hi>
was, they may grow worſe and
worſe as they grow older, and as
<hi>Jacob</hi> ſaid upon another account,
may by their great undutifulneſs and
ill behaviour bring down our gray
hairs with ſorrow to the Grave.</p>
            <p>We are apt, too apt indeed to
mutter and repine at the Providence
of God when he takes away our
Children when they are young, and
of great hopes as we think and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume;
but God knows what manner
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:137153:41"/>
of perſons they might have been, if
they had liv'd, whether they might
have prov'd good or bad, a joy or
grief unto us. What if theſe hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Children had liv'd to imbibe ill
Principles, to ſcoff at Virtue, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ride
the Being of a God, and to
make a mock of ſin? what if they had
liv'd to be profane and irreligious,
and to prove ſuch youths as we have
ſome in theſe days, ſhould we then
have thought their life a Bleſſing,
and not rather a Curſe unto us? and
who knows but there was a great
mixture of mercy in Gods Judgment
upon <hi>David,</hi> in taking away and
bereaving him of his Child, leſt he
ſhould have prov'd one of bad in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations,
as being ſprung of a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
Stock, and as the vulgar Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb
ſays, <hi>that which is bred in the
bone will hardly ever out of the
fleſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We ſee how ill his other Children
prov'd, <hi>Tamar</hi> was defil'd and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſham'd
of her ſelf; <hi>Amnon</hi> was
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:137153:42"/>
inceſtuous and brought a great ſtain
upon his Family: and his Deareſt
<hi>Abſolom</hi> was both a Murderer and a
Rebel, and died in ſuch a ſtate of
wickedneſs, that <hi>David</hi> was exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
troubled at his going out of
the World in ſuch an impenitent
condition, mightily deploring his
untimely Death, and wiſhing if God
had ſo pleas'd, that he had laid down
his life in exchange for his Sons, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it with the greateſt ingeminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as a ſign of the deepeſt ſorrow,
<hi>O my Son</hi> Abſolom, <hi>my Son, my Son,
would God I had died for thee, O</hi>
Abſolom, <hi>my Son, my Son.</hi> And if
theſe Children of <hi>David</hi> prov'd ſo
bad, who knows but the Child that
died might have prov'd as bad as any
of the reſt in caſe it had liv'd? Ah
Beloved, we know not what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of perſons our Children will
prove, what their qualities and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
may be, and therefore we
know not well what we do when
we murmur at Gods removing them
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:137153:42"/>
from us. And if we do but look
into the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> we may be eaſily
convinc't (and obſerve how we read
there) that Children are not always
ſuch bleſſings that we ſhould deſire
ſo much their living, for they may
be Curſes as well as Bleſſings to us,
according as they ſhall prove. <hi>A wiſe
Son maketh a glad Father, but a
fooliſh Son is the heavineſs of his
Mother,</hi> Prov. 10. 1. and in the 23.
of <hi>Prov.</hi> and 24. <hi>v. The Father of the
righteous ſhall greatly rejoice, and
he that begetteth a wiſe Child ſhall
have joy of him;</hi> and in the 17. ch.
and 21. v. <hi>He that begetteth a Fool
doth it to his ſorrow, and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of a Fool hath no joy;</hi> and in
the 25. v. <hi>A fooliſh Son is a grief
to his Father, and a bitterneſs to
her that bare him.</hi> In all which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
we may ſee, that a man is
much happier in having no Children
than ſuch as are fooliſh and vitious;
and that nothing can be a greater
grief and diſhonour to Parents, than
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:137153:43"/>
to have ſilly and wicked Children.
What comfort is there in having ſuch
lewd and profane Sons as old <hi>Eli</hi>'s,
who brought a ſcandal upon their
Father, and a Curſe upon their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
the whole Generation? O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

that had not ſullied its Soul with the
leaſt tincture of any actual ſin or
tranſgreſſion, and that it went as
pure out of the World as it came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it; whereas if it had liv'd to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity,
it might have been like the
reſt of the World, or died with ſome
great ſin upon it unrepented of, as
well as ſome of his Children had
done.</p>
            <p>And truly the ſame conſideration
may well be made uſe of by all Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
to bring them quietly to ſuſtain
the loſs of their Children when they
die in their nonage, and very young.
And what can be a more comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
conſideration, than for Parents
under ſuch loſſes, to think that their
Childrens Virtue if they had liv'd,
was very uncertain, and that Vice
was the moſt likely to prevail? that
ſin reigned more in the World than
goodneſs, that the greater part of
the World was ſtark naught, and
that but few continued in it but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
ſome ſpot or ſtain, and none
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:137153:44"/>
that was perfectly Innocent? And
therefore it might be a mercy to their
Children to be ſet out of the reach
of ſin and temptation, and to have
ſuch an early tranſlation to Heaven,
before they had done any thing to
hazard their Salvation, or to forfeit
the love of God and title to Eternal
Life and Happineſs. Well may Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
pronounce their Children bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
when they die in ſuch a ſtate of
Innocency. <hi>For of ſuch,</hi> ſays our
Saviour, <hi>is the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, Another conſideration
which pacify'd <hi>Davids</hi> ſorrows for
the loſs of his Child might very well
be this, That it was remov'd from
the great Evils and Calamity of the
World.</p>
            <p>This World (God knows) is but
a troubleſome place at the beſt to
live in, and no man muſt think to
go ſcot-free from troubles of one
kind or other. The <hi>Thracians,</hi> as <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi>
reports out of <hi>Herodotus,</hi> were
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:137153:44"/>
wont to weep at the Birth and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity
of their Children, to think
what a ſad and troubleſome Theatre
they entered upon, and that they
were born to know a great deal of
ſorrow and miſery; but to rejoice
at their departure and going off the
Stage, to think that they then reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
from the diſtracting cares and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietudes
of a troubleſome World,
and were paſt the reach and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
of all misfortunes. This World
is too low a Region to be free from
ſtorms and tempeſts, and there is no
expecting a perfect ſerenity but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the Clouds; and there is no
ſuch happineſs to be enjoy'd here
as a freedom from all miſery and
trouble, he being the happieſt man
at preſent that meets with the leaſt
trouble or perplexity; and therefore
no man of experience in the World
needs to be told, that all here is Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
and vexation of Spirit; and
whoever ſhall conſider the great
changes of miſery that are in the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:137153:45"/>
World, from War to Peſtilence,
from Peſtilence to Fire, from Fire to
great Confuſions which have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
not only in the memory of
many, but in our days, and within
the compaſs of a few Years; and
moreover, what great and terrible
judgments are continually impend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
over our Heads, and full upon
the Inhabitants of the Earth becauſe
their wickedneſs is great; and alſo
the continual loſſes and croſſes, the
ſorrows and diſappointments which
come of courſe, and happen accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the mutable condition of
things below. Whoever, I ſay, ſhall
ſeriouſly conſider this ſad revolution
and mixture of ſorrows, cannot judge
it in reaſon good being here, or look
upon the World as a deſirable place
to live in, much leſs think his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
or Relations the happier for
being here. And therefore <hi>David</hi>
might well think it unreaſonable to
mourn for the loſs of his Child, when
it was conſider'd, that it was gone
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:137153:45"/>
out of a croſs and troubleſome
World, where the higheſt and moſt
advantageous condition (as himſelf
had found by ſad and woful experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence)
could not exempt a man from
great Calamities, when he who was
his Father and a King, was forc'd
from his Throne, and put to his
ſhifts, and driven from Poſt to Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
and perhaps was reduc'd to ſuch
great ſtraits and extremities, that he
would have exchang'd his condition
with the meaneſt of his Subjects:
How could he mourn for the Death
of his Child when he conſidered that
it was ſubject to the ſame Calamities
as himſelf, and perhaps might prove
every whit as unfortunate in the
World if it had liv'd to ſucceed him,
and might have Inherited his trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
as well as his Crown? And
therefore he lookt upon it as a kind
Providence, that God had ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
prevented the Childs ſeeing
any of thoſe miſeries which the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
had felt, and thought it a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:137153:46"/>
happineſs and favour of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
that his Child went out of the
World without knowing or being
ſenſible what a trouble meant:
whereas himſelf had been ſufficiently
toſſed up and down upon the waves
of affliction, and miſerably broken
with the cares and inquietudes of a
troubleſome World, and knew the
World better than to eſteem it the
beſt or happieſt place that his Child
could be in. And truly all Parents
would do well to conſider how it
has far'd with them, what uſages
and entertainment they have met
with in the World, what reproaches
and ſlanders, what loſſes and vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations
have faln to their ſhare, and
how troubleſome a paſſage they
have had; and I do not queſtion,
but that upon a ſerious reflexion
upon the Calamities in their days,
and their own private perſonal ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings,
they will be ready to confeſs
with old <hi>Jacob,</hi> that the days of
their Pilgrimage have been few and
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:137153:46"/>
evil, and conclude them happieſt
that are out of it. And therefore all
Parents have reaſon to ceaſe mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for the loſs and death of their
Children, upon the ſame conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which we may well ſuppoſe <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
made uſe of, namely, that they
are paſt the Waves of this trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
World, and are taken away
from the evil to come.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Another thing which
might well prevent <hi>Davids</hi> extream
ſorrowing for the Death of his Child
might be this conſideration,</p>
            <p>That it was freed from thoſe ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
and diſeaſes which attend this
mortal life.</p>
            <p>No doubt but <hi>David</hi> upon the
loſs of his Child, did conſider what
innumerable Diſeaſes do continually
accoſt and prey upon humane Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
as firſt the many weakneſſes and
diſeaſes that are natural to and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
our Infancy and Childhood, as
the great pain of breeding teeth, the
being ſubject to the ſmall Pox, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gender
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:137153:47"/>
Worms, to fall into the Rick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets,
and many other diſtempers
which are common and peculiar to
Childhood; beſides the many dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
that Children are apt to run in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
and the ſad accidents that often
do befal them, whereby they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
either lameneſs or deformity,
or come to an untimely end. And if
we have the good fortune to get ſafe
over our Childhood, and to come
to riper years, yet as we grow ſtrong,
ſo our diſeaſes are ſtronger, and in
our youth our blood is hot and fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouriſh
and quickly in a flame, and
our very ſtrength of nature helps to
augment our diſtempers, and makes
them prove the more fatal to us; and
when we come to the perfect ſtate
of Manhood, our very dependance
and preſumption upon the ſtrength
and benefit of nature, makes us bold
with thoſe Vices which oftentimes
help to cut us off in the midſt of our
days, and then if we live to old Age,
that is a Diſeaſe of it ſelf, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:137153:47"/>
but ſorrow is our Portion, and
the pains of Death lay hold on us:
ſo that if we take a ſurvey of our
whole life, and of our paſſage from
the Womb to the Tomb, we ſhall
find that every ſtage and period of
this mortal life is way-laid and beſet
with Death. And we know that
there are certain dangerous ſeaſons
in the Age of Man which we call
Climacterical Years, wherein our life
is in great Controverſy, and we have
a puſh for it whether we ſhall live
or die: And truly there are ſo many
Diſeaſes that are of courſe, and
many more that are incidental and
happen between our infancy and
youth, that 'tis a great wonder that
we ever live to be men, and much
more that we ſhould paſs all thoſe
caſualties and misfortunes which lie
all along in our way to the Age of
threeſcore Years and ten. And more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
it may be conſidered what a
great fatality Gods Judgments make,
what a great depopulation and vaſt
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:137153:48"/>
havock of Mankind, the Plague, and
Sword, and Famine do make; and
that when theſe come they ſweep
away Millions as with the Beſom of
Deſtruction.</p>
            <p>But then ſecondly, If we do fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
obſerve how many ſorts and
kinds of Diſeaſes there are in the
World, how that new Diſeaſes daily
ſtart up, and that old ones ſo vary
and alter in their circumſtances, and
contract ſuch ſtrange degrees of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity,
that they become new
too; how alſo that ſome Diſeaſes are
acute, others Chronical, and that
ſome are rackt with the Stone, others
tortured with the Gout; ſome are
drown'd in a Dropſie, others burnt
up with a Feavour; and that there
is ſcarce a man but has a Diſeaſe pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
to himſelf, and proper to his
conſtitution, and dies ſomething a
ſeveral way from his fellow Mortals:
I ſay, whoever ſhall make this obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of the great ſwarm and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicity
of Diſeaſes which aſſault
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:137153:48"/>
Mankind (and that whereas the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes
now mention'd do kill their
thouſands, ſo there is a Conſumption
which kills its ten thouſands, and
deſerves the Name of <hi>Apollyon,</hi> the
great Deſtroyer of Mankind) muſt
needs grant that the life of man is
in jeopardy every moment. And
that he is obnoxious to a great deal
of miſery whilſt he lives.</p>
            <p>But if my Courage or your Hearts
would ſerve you to go into the Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital,
and there turn over the great
Volume of Diſeaſes, and ſee what
huge havock they make; to behold
how the Canker has par'd off the ſide
of one mans Face, and rotted off a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothers
Noſe, and eaten out an
Eye, and carried away a Limb; to
ſee how the Palſy has mortified ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and ſtruck him half dead; and
how many either by natural or viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Conſumptions are turn'd into
meer Skeletons and walking Ghoſts,
and are only the ſhadows of men:
Here you will ſay are ſad ſpectacles of
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:137153:49"/>
mortality, here are ſuch ſights of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
frailty, as are enough to make
the hardeſt heart to bleed, and to
ſqueeze tears from a ſtock. Who can
forbear weeping and lamenting to
ſee Man that is born of a Woman
become the ſpoils of ſo many Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
and to be Anatomized and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſected,
even alive? Here then we
may ſee the ſad and diſmal ruins of
theſe fleſhly Bodies, and what miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Creatures we are when God is
pleas'd to afflict, and to lay ſore and
grievous Diſeaſes upon us. And tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
we are all ſubject to various and
manifold Diſeaſes, which iſſue forth
in effects according to their ſeveral
kinds and qualities; the matter of
moſt Diſeaſes lies lodg'd in our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and brooding within us: and we
have the unhappineſs to inherit ſome
Diſeaſes by traduction from our Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
and there are many more
which are hatcht by our Vices, and
prove the moſt deadly and mortife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.
Some Diſeaſes are ſo favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:137153:49"/>
as to carry off quietly and ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily,
and others are more cruel, and
like the Tyrant multiply our
Deaths, and kill us by piece-meals;
and nothing is a truer obſervation
than this, that we no ſooner begin
to live but we proceed to die, and
are every day going forward and
ſtepping towards the Grave. But then
although life be a ſweet and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
thing in it ſelf, and it be natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
for all men to deſire to ſpin out
the thread of life to the utmoſt
length; yet God may ſend thoſe
Diſeaſes upon us which may make
us weary of our lives, and to wiſh
for Death and the Grave; and ſo we
find that <hi>Job</hi> was ſo peſter'd with
Diſeaſes, that his Life was a burthen
to him, and he does frequently and
paſſionately beg of God to do him
the favour to diſpatch him, and put
an end to his days, as we may ſee in
the 6. <hi>ch.</hi> of <hi>Job</hi> and 8. <hi>v. O that I
might have my requeſt, and that
God would grant me the thing that
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:137153:50"/>
I long for! even that it would pleaſe
God to deſtroy me, that he would
let looſe his hand, and cut me off;</hi>
and in the 3. <hi>ch.</hi> and 20. <hi>v.</hi> He ſpeaks
much to the ſame purpoſe, Saying,
<hi>Wherefore is light given to him that
is in miſery, and life unto the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in ſoul? Which long for death
but it cometh not, and dig for it
more than for hid treaſures:
Which rejoice exceedingly, and are
glad when they can find the grave;</hi>
and in the 7. <hi>ch.</hi> 3, 4, and 5. <hi>verſ.</hi>
He declares how uneaſy and reſtleſs
he was through the greatneſs and
violence of his Diſeaſes, and how
ſeverely he was handled: <hi>So am I
made to poſſeſs months of vanity,
and weariſome nights are appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to me. When I lie down, I ſay,
When ſhall I ariſe, and the night
be gone? I am full of toſſings
to and fro, unto the dawning of the
day. My fleſh is clothed with worms
and clods of duſt; my skin is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
and become loathſome:</hi> and in
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:137153:50"/>
the 13. <hi>ch.</hi> and 14. <hi>v.</hi> He profeſſes
that he had ſo little joy and comfort
in his life, that he would eſteem it
a mercy to die, ſaying, My Soul chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
Death, and ſtrangling rather than
life. Nay, he goes further, and ſays,
that he was quite out of conceit
with living, and would not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal
on Earth for never ſo much,
they are his own words, <hi>I loath it,
I would not live always, let me
alone for my days are vanity;</hi> and
in the 10. <hi>ch.</hi> and the 1. <hi>v.</hi> His afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
ſeem to have been ſo great and
laſting, that they almoſt wore out
his patience, and he could not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
them any longer; which makes
him ſpeak like a man in great extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
and a deſperate condition: Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>My ſoul is weary of my life;</hi>
and ſo <hi>David</hi> in the 6. <hi>Pſ.</hi> and 6. <hi>v.</hi>
utters himſelf in the ſame manner,
Saying, <hi>I am weary with my groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;</hi>
And therefore <hi>David</hi> might
well ceaſe ſorrowing for the loſs of
his Child, when he conſider'd the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:137153:51"/>
manifold Diſeaſes that mankind is
liable unto, and that it often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens,
and that he himſelf had ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienc'd
it, that men meet with
ſuch ſorrows and afflictions that
make them weary of the World, and
exceedingly imbitter their lives, and
why then ſhould he be troubled at
the death of his Child? and that it did
not live to be in danger of enduring
all the Diſeaſes in the Bill of Morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity?
And how did he know but
that if it had liv'd, it might have
prov'd of a ſickly and weak Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution,
and perhaps might bring
thoſe Infirmities into the World with
it as were paſt all Cure, and might
be a ſorrow to the Parents, and a
miſery to their Child as long as it
liv'd. And beſides, Children run
many riſques and hazards whilſt they
are young, and come oftentimes to
great miſchances; and either they
contract a lameneſs by a fall, or loſe
one Eye or both by the ſmall Pox, or
are drown'd, or burnt, or kill'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunately;
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:137153:51"/>
any of which would
prove matter of greater ſorrow to
Parents than a bare natural Death.
And therefore ſeeing God was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to take it away ſo very young,
and that it dropt off with its firſt ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
there was a great mixture of
mercy in this ſad Providence, and
little reaſon to be griev'd at ſuch an
early Death, when it was ſo natural,
and perhaps prevented the meeting
many ſad miſchances, and a Troop
of Diſeaſes which are incident to
this frail and periſhing life. And
truly all Parents have the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
(which we ſuppoſe <hi>David</hi> had)
to comfort up themſelves after the
loſs of their Children, when they die
very young; as conſidering that an
early death may prevent a miſerable
life; and that it is much better to
die young; than to live longer and
have ſuch Diſeaſes grow and hang
upon us as ſhall make life a burthen
to us. And indeed though we are
extreamly deſirous of living, and are
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:137153:52"/>
ſad and melancholy when we think
of dying; yet we may live ſo long
as that we may have enough of it,
and may meet with ſuch ſore Diſeaſes
as may rob us of all pleaſure and
comfort in living, and ſpoil our ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
any contentment in the greateſt
injoyments this World does afford
us; we know how the caſe ſtood
with <hi>Job,</hi> and how that afflictions
crowded in ſo thick upon him, that
as he often profeſſes, they made him
even weary of his life. And there
is none of us that has any priviledge
or exemption, or greater ſecurity
from Diſeaſes than <hi>Job,</hi> nor
have we Bodies of Braſs, or Sinews
of Iron more than he, but we have
Bodies ſubject to the ſame Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and liable to be invaded by the
ſame Diſeaſes, if God to make an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment
of our patience ſhall think
fit to handle us as ſeverely as he did
<hi>Job,</hi> and to inflict the ſame Diſeaſes
upon us: And therefore we need
not ſo much deſire long life and
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:137153:52"/>
length of days as commonly we do;
Becauſe it may ſo happen, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we run out half our race, or
come to the middle of our Courſe,
beſides the troubles that are from
without, we may meet with ſuch a
numerous train of bodily afflictions,
that may make us more covetous of
death than ever we were of life, and
we may live to know ſo much ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
and pain before we die, that
like <hi>Job</hi> we may be ready to curſe
our Birth Day, and wiſh that we
had never been born: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we ſhould not be ſo very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
to depart and leave the
World at any time, though never ſo
ſoon; becauſe we may ſuppoſe, that
the longer we continue in it the
worſe it may be for us, and although
we are in health at preſent, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
our ſelves finely, yet Diſeaſes
may within a little time overtake and
grow upon us, which may make our
life a perfect torment to us, and
cauſe us to conſume our days in mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery.
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:137153:53"/>
To ſpeak compendiouſly, all
Parents and others have little reaſon
to ingulph themſelves in ſorrows for
the Death of their Friends and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
and more eſpecially if it be
early and natural, becauſe when they
are taken away ſo ſoon they happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
miſs of thoſe ſore and grievous
diſtempers which in running out the
whole ſtage of life, do ſeize upon
oftentimes, and render this preſent
life extreamly bitter and unaccepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
And indeed what comfort is
there to ſee our Friends often ſick,
or roaring with the Stone or the
Gout, or ſome acute pain, or to have
them of an ill habit of Body, or of
a broken health, and to be ever
crazy and lingring with ſome fixt
and incurable Diſeaſe? What plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
is it to ſee our Relations rotten
and unſound, and patcht up with
Medicines, and ſupported with the
Arts of Phyſick, and kept alive by
nice and ſuperſtitious obſervations
of diet? or what delight can we take
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:137153:53"/>
in injoying our Friends when they
cannot enjoy themſelves? And what
reaſon then have we to lay ſo much
to heart the death of our Friends
and Relations, and to pine away
meerly for ſorrow that they are
gone? whereas they are now freed
from all the ſorrow and contagion of
bodily diſtempers, and have eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
thoſe ſore burthens which we
are like to feel and ſuffer if we ſtay
here: Methinks we ſhould rather
comfort our ſelves, as we may well
ſuppoſe <hi>David</hi> did, to think that
our Relations when they are dead
and gone, are paſt the ſhock and
fury of a Diſeaſe, that they have
endured one brunt for all; that they
have charg'd that Enemy home,
which we ſo much fear and muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
every day to encounter withal:
ſo that conſidering how we that are
left behind are to run the Gantlet
through Troops of ſorrow, and to
paſs the Pikes of a thouſand Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
'tis highly unreaſonable to mourn
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:137153:54"/>
and ſorrow for the dead, they being
paſt all poſſibility of Diſeaſes, and
far removed from this Climate of
Sickneſs and Death.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, Another thing which
might reſtrain <hi>Davids</hi> ſorrowing
for the loſs of his Child, might be
this conſideration: That it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leas'd
from the great pains and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries
which it lately felt and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured.</p>
            <p>'Tis certain and indubitable, that
the Soul does not quit its Manſion of
the Body without great ſtrivings
and reluctancy, and though it be
conſider'd that the Child was but in
its Infancy, and newly in poſſeſſion
of life, and that the Soul and Body
had contracted but a late acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and that the Friendſhip was
very new; yet where there is ſuch
a ſtrict Conjunction as there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Soul and the Body, though
but for a moment of time, the ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
cannot be without great grief
and ſorrow; where there is ſuch a
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:137153:54"/>
cloſe union and intimacy, there is
no parting without pain and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
and conſequently, though the
Soul of the Child was now juſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
into its New Tenement, yet it
was ſo firmly ſetled, and had taken
that deep rooting, that it could not
be remov'd or ejected out of poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
without great diſturbance. And
therefore to ſee a Child ſtrugling for
life, and to have only breath enough
to intitle it to life, could not but
wonderfully affect and produce great
Agonies of ſorrows in the hearts of
the Spectators. And we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
that men have naturally that
compaſſion as to pity even a Brute
when it lies in pain and miſery, and
look upon it as an act of mercy to
diſpatch it out of the way. And
therefore <hi>David</hi> ſeeing his Child in
that extream anguiſh and diſtreſs, in
that ſickneſs to Death, and that there
was no way to eaſe and relieve it,
could not but reflect upon it as a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
mercy of God to take away
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:137153:55"/>
the Child, and to put an end to ſuch
a painful and miſerable life. <hi>David</hi>
could not forbear weeping and ſadly
lamenting over his Child when he
ſaw it in the pangs of Death, and in
thoſe frightful Convulſions which
were precedaneous to its diſſolution.
But when it pleas'd God to ſeal up
its breath, and to give it a happy
Iſſue out of this troubleſome World,
then <hi>David</hi> began to be better ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied,
and to be ſomewhat com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted
with the conſideration that
God had in mercy releaſed his Child
from that pain and miſery which it
lately underwent, and the ſight
whereof would have pierc'd the
hardeſt heart living. So that all thoſe
that have the ſad opportunity of
ſtanding by their Relations and
Friends when they are upon their
ſick Beds, and in the approaches of
Death, and there to obſerve what a
tumult and commotion nature is in
at that time, and with what pain
and trouble the Soul and Body take
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:137153:55"/>
their leave one of the other, muſt
needs conclude their parting and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
to be a more diſmal and
amazing ſight than a Divorce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the moſt deſperate Lovers.
Let us but be preſent with our
Friends in the heat and rage of their
Diſtemper, or in the ultimate efforts
of life, and we ſhall then ſee a tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendous
and ghaſtly ſpectacle, which
is hardly to be related without tears,
and cannot be ſeen without horror
and aſtoniſhment. O the hollow
ſighs, and the deep ſobs and pierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
groans of our dying Friends,
which are enough to wound any
heart living, and to ſtrike that dread
upon us, that the ſound of their
cries and groans ſhall never be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten,
and can we pretend to pity
them when we ſee them in ſo much
anguiſh and diſtreſs, and in the depths
of miſery, and ſhall we ſo contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
our pretences to ſorrow, and
our compaſſion for them in the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs
of Death, as to be troubled
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:137153:56"/>
when they are out of miſery, and
to deplore their going to reſt. Shall
we weep and mourn to ſee our
Friends upon the Rack, and in great
torment, and ſhall we take on the
more when they are paſt the ſenſe
and feeling of any pain? How can
we reconcile this Poſthumous Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to common reaſon? Or can we
think to perſwade people that we
lov'd our Relations dearly, when they
ſee us grieve when they were in mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery,
but to grieve more when they
are ſtept into happineſs? In a word,
we may yield to the meltings of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
or the tenderneſs of our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
and gratify our compaſſions
in mourning for our Friends when
they are in great miſery, and the
Agonies of Death. For a compaſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
grief is both natural and reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
and if we have any ſpark of
good nature we cannot but be mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lify'd
at the mournful accents of the
moſt deſpicable Creature when 'tis
in pain and great extremities. But
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:137153:56"/>
then to mourn exceſſively for our
Friends when they are out of pain,
and the bitterneſs of Death is paſt,
is both unreaſonable and unchriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an:
unreaſonable becauſe they have
endured and paſs'd the worſt, and
are perfectly diſcharg'd from thoſe
troubles and ſorrows which thoſe
that remain alive are ſubject unto;
and 'tis unchriſtian, becauſe it gives
occaſion to people to ſuſpect our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
of a Reſurrection and a future
Life; and that we are not really
perſwaded that our Friends are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
for the better, and much for
their advantage. And therefore the
Apoſtle in the firſt to the <hi>Theſſal.</hi>
4. <hi>ch.</hi> and 13. <hi>v.</hi> admoniſhes Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
not to grieve and take on for
the dead as others which have no
hope, leſt they ſhould by that means
ſcandalize their Religion, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their belief of a Reſurrection
ſuſpected and dubitable: ſo that we
are concern'd as Chriſtians, and as
we tender the reputation of our
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:137153:57"/>
Chriſtian Faith, not to be laviſh of
our tears, nor over profuſe in our
expences of ſorrow for the dead, leſt
we ſhould be ſuſpected of believing
our Friends happier here than they
will be hereafter. But we ſhould
rather in a manner rejoice at the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture
of thoſe who have liv'd well
and innocently, and die in the Lord:
Foraſmuch as the Apoſtle tells us they
<hi>ſhall reſt from their labours</hi> and have
<hi>all tears wip't away from their Eyes,
Revel.</hi> 7. 17. And we ſhould as our
Church wiſely directs us in the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
for the Burial of the dead, give
hearty thanks to God that it hath
pleaſed him to deliver our Dear
Friends and Relations out of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries
of this ſinful World, which
may furniſh us with another conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
that might poſſibly incur
into <hi>Davids</hi> mind, and help to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
and allay his ſorrowing for his
dead Child, and that is this:</p>
            <p>That it was remov'd far above
the power of ſin and temptation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:137153:57"/>
We at preſent, as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi>
complains, carry about us a Body of
ſin and death. We are ſubject to
manifold ſins and temptations, and
have brought with us into the World
thoſe corruptions which in time will
ripen into and ſally forth in great
actual tranſgreſſions. <hi>Job</hi> makes a
kind of wonder at it, that any man
ſhould think he can be perfectly pure
and innocent in this body of fleſh:
<hi>For what is man that he ſhould be
clean? or he that is born of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
that he ſhould be righteous?
Job</hi> 15. 14. and ſo <hi>David</hi> tells us,
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. 5. That ſin is the Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
of our Parents, that we are
infected with it in the Womb, and
that we are born with propenſions
to evil, <hi>Behold, I was ſhapen in
iniquity; and in ſin did my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
conceive me.</hi> So that the ſeeds
of diſobedience are lodged in our
nature, and the ground-work of ſin
is laid deep within us, and there is
nothing wanting but time and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:137153:58"/>
to make it bring forth in
abundance: So that when our Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
die very young, and go early
to their Graves, we may comfort
our ſelves with this conſideration,
that we loſe them in good time, and
before they have added any actual to
original ſin; and that if they had liv'd
much longer they would have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
a new and further guilt, and
perhaps have advanc'd in ſin as they
did in Years: for 'tis certain, that
the ſtrength of nature gives ſtrength
to our ſins too, and 'tis only Age
that qualifies and fits us for great
and notorious wickedneſs. So that
that ſin which was only in Embryo
in our infancy comes within a few
years to a perfect ſhape, and our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſions
to evil, in a ſmall proceſs of
time are reduced to real and viſible
acts. My meaning is, that although
there is a natural aptneſs and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clivity
in Mankind to ſin and err
from the Laws of our Maker, yet
ſin does lie hid and brooding in the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:137153:58"/>
time of our infancy, and is only
hatcht into perfection by the addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of longer time: and although
we have all the principles of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs
inherent in us at the very firſt
moment of our Nativity; yet we
are too impotent to commit evil, and
to offend God at that rate, as when
we come to a full ſtature in Years
and knowledge. We may be full of
bad inclinations when we are young
and Children, but 'tis only Age that
can make us capable of doing miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief,
and to be workers of iniquity,
and we cannot ſo highly provoke
God when we are ignorant and
childiſh, and know nothing of him,
as when we come to the perfect uſe
of reaſon, and to know his will, and
yet run Counter to it. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Death of our Children may
be a happy prevention of their ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
and if they live ſo long as to
receive the benefit of Baptiſm, and
to be regenerate and born anew of
Water and the Holy Ghoſt, and ſo
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:137153:59"/>
be made lively members of Chriſts
Church, we are bound to thank
God for the mercy of their Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
and that they had their ſins
waſh'd away in the laver of Holy
Baptiſm; ſo as that they go much
purer out of the World than they
came into it: whereas if they had
liv'd longer in the World they would
have contracted a greater guilt, and
had more ſins to anſwer for; they
would have been continually liable
to temptations, and in danger of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
into great and grievous ſins, and
to be corrupted by the bad examples
which abound in all places of the
World. And therefore there is no
reaſon why Parents ſhould ſo much
lament their Childrens leaving them
ſo ſoon; if they do ſeriouſly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that 'tis a naughty World we
live in, and that mens love and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of wickedneſs is exceeding
great, and that 'tis impoſſible to eſcape
all the pollutions that are in it: and
if they do further conſider, how
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:137153:59"/>
much humane nature is tainted with
original ſin and corruption, which
prompts us on to evil continually,
and what a ſubtile and vigilant Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary
we have, who is always ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to beguile and deſtroy us; and
how thick ſet the World is with
ſnares and temptations; I ſay, if this
conſideration did but enter into our
minds, it would be of great force
and power to aſſwage our Paſſion,
and to allay our ſorrow for the death
of our Friends and Relations: it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a very comfortable thing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template
the happineſs and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of thoſe that have ſhook of
the clogs and fetters of the fleſh, and
let fall their Bodies, the troubleſome
Mantles of their Souls, and are now
expatiating in Regions of Bliſs and
Happineſs, and live in the pure Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Goodneſs, and where 'tis
impoſſible that any temptation
ſhould approach, or ſin have any
Dominion over them.</p>
            <p>Laſtly; Another thing which
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:137153:60"/>
might ſtop <hi>Davids</hi> ſorrowing for
the loſs of his Child, might be this
conſideration, that it was the will
of God it ſhould be ſo.</p>
            <p>He conſidered that it was altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
fooliſh and in vain to enter into
any controverſie with God about his
dealings with his Child, or to ſtand
expoſtulating the juſtice of God in
taking it away. For he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd
that Gods will ought to be a
Law unto us, and that there is no
need of diſputing the Righteouſneſs
and Equity thereof, it being always
rul'd and determin'd by his wiſdom,
and juſtice, and goodneſs. For
though God be of an infinite and
uncontroulable power, and can do
whatſoever he pleaſes both in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and Earth; yet there is a Maxime
in Theology as well as Policy, That
the King of Heaven can do no
wrong. It muſt be acknowledg'd
by us all, that our life and being is
the gift and bleſſing of God, and
ſo is the life of our Children too;
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:137153:60"/>
and therefore when God does in
mercy give us Children, ſo he may
with juſtice take them away. For
may not he diſpoſe of his gifts, and
do with his own as he pleaſes? God
lent us Children for a little time on
purpoſe to pleaſe us; ſhall we be
troubled when he reſumes them to
himſelf, or griev'd when he requires
them back? we are to obſerve, that
there is a great difference between
Gods way of diſpoſing his gifts, and
that of mens. For though it be
common with men to make a Deed
of Gift, and to transfer their own
right to a thing wholly to another,
ſo as to loſe all propriety in it; yet
God does not make the ſame diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
of his gifts in that abſolute
manner; but when he gives us Riches,
or Honour, or Children, or any
other gifts, he does not make over
to us all the title to, and intereſt in
them, but reſerves to himſelf a power
of Revocation, ſo as that he may
demand them back at pleaſure; he
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:137153:61"/>
only gives us the uſe and comfort of
them for a time, but never parts
with the propriety, or reſigns up all
his claim to them: And beſides, we
ſhould conſider, that although God
does put thoſe Children into our
power, and under our juriſdiction,
which he is pleas'd to give us; yet
that Parents have not that abſolute
power over their Children that God
has, nor are they wholly at their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal,
as to the great Iſſues of Life
and Death, which are only in Gods
Hands. And therefore though we
may look upon our Children as our
own, as being fleſh of our fleſh, and
bone of our bone, though we may
appropriate them to our ſelves, and
reckon we have the beſt title to
them of all our Poſſeſſions; yet ſtill
God retains the ſupream right, and
has the firſt and oldeſt title to them,
and we are only deputed by God to
be the Overſeers and Guardians of
our Children: and therefore as God
is pleaſed to commit our Children to
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:137153:61"/>
our care for ſome time, yet when he
does not like they ſhould be any
longer under our tuition, he does in
mercy and kindneſs to them take
them away; when he ſees it not
good for them to continue with us,
he then to ſhew his Authority, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves
them from us, and calls them
home. And therefore Parents would
do well to conſider, that God has
more right to their Children than
themſelves, and that they are abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
at his diſpoſal, but not at
theirs, that they have not that power
of Life and Death over their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
which God has: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Parents have no reaſon to be in
that Hurricane and ſtorm of Paſſion
upon the loſs of their Children, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
they are troubled that God
ſhould have his will more than they
have theirs; unleſs they are grieved
that God ſhould take upon him to
diſpoſe of their Children without
their conſent and liking; which ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues
a great impiety of mind, as if
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:137153:62"/>
they thought that God was either
unjuſt in taking away the Children
from their right Owners, or unmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful
in not ſparing of their lives,
which was a greater comfort to them
than all other enjoyments; whereas
it would be much better, and tend
to huſh and ſilence all the ſorrows of
Parents for the loſs of their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
to conſider, that they are but
under-Proprietors of their Children,
and that they came firſt from God,
before they came to them; and
that as God is the donour of them,
ſo he may well be allow'd the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
of them, whether for Life or
Death. And beſides, it ſhould be
conſider'd, that Gods will is and
ought to be ſupream, and Maſter of
ours; and that we ſhould patiently
leave them to Gods will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
when he does not think fit to
leave them to ours. It was an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
ſaying, and ſubmiſſive ſpeech
of <hi>Jobs, ch.</hi> 1. 21. who when God
was pleaſed to bereave him of all his
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:137153:62"/>
Children by violent and unnatural
Deaths, and of all his Worldly goods
too, yet ſubmitted to his great miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes
with an invincible patience
and mildneſs, ſaying, <hi>Naked came I
out of my Mothers Womb, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
ſhall I return thither, the Lord
gave, and the Lord hath taken
away, Bleſſed be the name of the
Lord.</hi> Here is an Example beyond
Example of Patience, and quiet ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
to the will of God in one
of the greateſt and ſevereſt trials
imaginable; here indeed is an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
fit for our imitation, and
ſhould be drawn into practice upon
the like occaſion. And it would
highly become Parents and others,
and indeed is the duty of all to lay
themſelves at the will of God, and
with all humble Proſtrations reſign
up their wills to his, and to reſign
up their Children and Relations
freely to him, who firſt gave them
freely to them. And to ſay in like
manner with <hi>Job,</hi> God has indeed
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:137153:63"/>
bleſſed us with Children, but has
not thought fit to continue them to
us: and though we could have been
well content to have enjoy'd them,
if God had ſo pleas'd; yet we are
content to want them, being he

and for us to take them away. <hi>The

taken away; Bleſſed be the name of

               <hi>Seneca</hi> will teach
us otherwiſe in
words to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
that we ought
not to reckon all
that we enjoy our
own, or to look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
our Children as
a ſure Inheritance,
and entailed upon
us, but conſider, that
they are of the ſame
uncertain hold and
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:137153:63"/>
tenure as other outward bleſſings
are, that they are given us but for
an uncertain time, and that we muſt
not promiſe to our ſelves any long
or certain enjoyment of them; if
we are allow'd the uſe, and benefit,
and comfort of our Children for a
time, 'tis not fitting that we ſhould
mutter or think much to part with
them when God demands his own,
and requires back what he only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to us by way of lone; but
rather be in a readineſs to part with
our Children and all other bleſſings
when God will not truſt us with
them any longer.</p>
            <p>Having thus ſhew'd upon what
conſiderations <hi>David</hi> might well
ceaſe ſorrowing for his dead Child,
and which may be of excellent uſe and
ſervice to ſupport and comfort o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
under the like loſſes, and to
prevent all exceſſive mourning for
the Death of their Friends and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
eſpecially when they die
young, I ſhall now winde up the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:137153:64"/>
whole Diſcourſe with a word or
two,</p>
            <p>Firſt, By way of Reproof.</p>
            <p>Secondly, By way of Exhortation.</p>
            <p>Firſt, By way of Reproof to all
thoſe that are apt to quarrel with
Providence, and to entertain hard
thoughts of God, as if he were either
unjuſt or unmerciful when he takes
away their neareſt and deareſt Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
from them; and do often in
the bitterneſs of their Souls, and
the great anguiſh of their ſpirits,
charge God fooliſhly, and ſpeak un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adviſedly
with their lips, and think
they do well (like <hi>Jonah</hi>) to fret
againſt the Almighty, in that he
deals with them after ſuch a manner,
and will not ſuffer them to enjoy the
deſire of their Eyes, and the joy of
their Hearts, ſo long as they wiſh
and deſire. They aſſert with a great
deal of ſorrow, that their Soul was
wrapt up in the life of ſuch and ſuch
a Child, that it was an <hi>Abſolom</hi> for
its Beauty, and a <hi>Solomon</hi> for its
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:137153:64"/>
Wiſdom, and a <hi>Moſes</hi> for its meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and good nature; that it was
very pregnant and a great Wit, and
gave great and lively Specimens of
future Vertue and Wiſdom; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
for God to deprive them of a
Child that had naturally ſuch Charms,
and whoſe vertuous temper and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
did preſage ſo much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
to themſelves, and ſo great a
benefit to the World, muſt needs
make deep and melancholy impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
upon their Spirits, and put
them into an extream Paſſion. And
thus Parents and others are apt to
clamour againſt and cenſure the
dealings of an afflicting Providence,
when it comes home to them, and
touches them in part of themſelves,
and ſuch as they profeſs to love as
dearly as their own Souls: whereas
'tis an utter fault in them thus to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine
at the hand of God, and they
know not what Spirit they are of
when they fall into ſuch fits of Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
and paroxyſms of diſcontent,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:137153:65"/>
refuſing like <hi>Rachel</hi> to be comforted,
becauſe their Children and Relations
are not; and wiſh like <hi>Elijah</hi> in a
pet, that God would take away
their life too, for they are no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than thoſe that are gone before
them. But is this like men or like
Chriſtians to be abſorpt and ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
up in a <hi>vortex</hi> of ſorrow,
and to be carried away with ſuch an
Euroclydon and violent ſtorm of
Paſſion? O the great folly and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs
that is in the hearts of men,
thus to grumble at Providence, and
to be ſo much out of humour as to
fall ſick as <hi>Ahab</hi> did for very vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that we cannot enjoy what we
have a mind to, and a great long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to poſſeſs. So great and ſtupen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous
is our ſtubborneſs and obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy
not to yield to Gods will nor
ſubmit to his pleaſure, but to take
on and rave like mad people, and
to complain grievouſly like <hi>Laban,</hi>
that we have loſt our Gods, our
greateſt hopes and comforts, when
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:137153:65"/>
God has only taken away our Idols.
But we had beſt have a care that
we be not ſo very impatient and
outragious when God takes away
our Relations from us; and ſo cauſe
and provoke him to write more bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
things againſt us, and bereave us
of all our Worldly Comforts, and
of the light of his favour, and the
ſupports of his Spirit, which would
be the greateſt and ſoreſt loſs that
can poſſibly befal us.</p>
            <p>Secondly, By way of Exhortation
to Parents and all others who may
be concern'd in the loſs of Relations
and Friends, that they would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to compoſe themſelves to
a quiet, and humble, and patient
ſubmiſſion to the will of God in
the ſevereſt of his diſpenſations;
that they would comport and
demean themſelves with that tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
and moderation at the Death
of their Friends, as becomes Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
who profeſs a firm belief of a
future Reſurrection, and a future
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:137153:66"/>
life in glory; and that they would
baniſh all unkind, and uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
thoughts of God when he is
pleaſed to take away their Darlings
and Favourites, and quietly acquieſce
in his Providence, and endeavour to
believe, that what God doth is beſt
both for themſelves and their Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
ſaying with all humility and
ſubmiſſion of Soul, It is the Lord,
let him do what ſeemeth him
good.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It would be wiſdom in
all Parents and others to conſider,
that their Children and Friends are
mortal, and of humane race, and
that they are born in order to die.
And ſo <hi>Seneca</hi> adviſes his Friend
<hi>Marcia,</hi> not to grieve or take on
deſperately for the loſs of her Son,
but to conſider, that mortality was
an appendage to humane Nature,
<hi>Et ex quo primum lucem vidit, iter
mortis ingreſſus eſt;</hi> that he no
ſooner began to live but he began
to die, and that life is a conſtant
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:137153:66"/>
journeying and properation to the
Grave. And 'tis well worth our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring
what is reported of <hi>Anax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agoras,</hi>
that when he was warmly
ingag'd in a Philoſophical Diſquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and word was brought unto
him that his Son was dead, he did not
ſeem in any diſorder, or to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compos'd
at the news, but went on
with his Diſcourſe very ſmoothly, and
only made this reply, That he knew
that he was the Father of one that
was mortal. <hi>Anaxagorae inter fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliares
ſuos de natura rerum diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerenti,
filii mortem nunciatam
tradunt; nihil<expan>
                     <am>

niſi, ſe illum genuiſſe mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talem.</hi>
Cicero de Conſola. And
therefore all perſons to prevent the
being ſo much troubled and ſtartled
at the Death of their Relations,
ſhould often meditate on Death, and
be frequently poſſeſs'd with thoughts
of their own and others mortality;
and when they live in a daily expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation
of their own Death and thoſe
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:137153:67"/>
that belong unto them, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be amaz'd at the early Death of
their Relations, or ſorely afflicted
when it pleaſeth God to take them
away firſt. For the looking upon
the life of their Relations to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
as uncertain as their own,
muſt needs make their death more
tolerable, than when they reckon and
depend upon their living; <hi>quae mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
antè praeviſà ſunt, languidius in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currunt,</hi>
ſayes <hi>Seneca.</hi> When we
think of a thing long before-hand,
it loſes of its terror, and we are
not ſo much troubled at it when it
actually comes. So that if we did
but conſider that our Children and
Relations are as mortal as our ſelves,
and that 'tis no rarity for them to
die before us, we ſhould not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to break our hearts with over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
grief, or to bury our ſelves in
ſorrow at the death of our Relations,
come it ſooner or later. But as <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca</hi>
obſerves, <hi>In hoc omnes errore
verſamur, ut non putemus ad mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:137153:67"/>

juventa, omniſ<expan>

                     <ex>que</ex>
                  </expan> aetas ferat;</hi> 'tis a
general error, and popular to think
that the Aged and the Decrepit muſt
needs die firſt; whereas the youngeſt
are as liable to Death as they, and
are taken away every whit as ſoon.
And again in the ſame Conſolatory
Diſcourſe: <hi>Tot praeter Domum
noſtram ducuntur exequiae, de mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te
non cogitamus, tot acerba funera.
Nos togam noſtrorum infantium,
nos militiam &amp; Paternae haeredita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis
ſucceſſionem animo agitamus.</hi>
There are (ſayes he) ſo many Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals
and ſpectacles of mortality
paſs by our doors every day, and
we do not regard them, nor lay to
heart this Death of others: But we
are thinking to make our Children
fine and great, and what great Heirs
they will be after our deceaſe: But
we think of nothing leſs than our
Childrens dying, which makes their
death ſo very grievous and ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:137153:68"/>
unto us: Whereas by a due
premeditation on death, and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalling
it in our thoughts, both our
own death, and that of our Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
would become leſs terrible and
aſtoniſhing, as being a thing which
we every day expected and ſtood
looking for.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, It would be very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
and prudential to command
or check our paſſion in due time,
and not to let it ſpin out to too
great a length. For as <hi>Seneca</hi> tells
<hi>Marcia,</hi> that our tears cannot al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
flow, nor our mourning laſt
always. <hi>Dolorem dies conſumit,
quamvis contumaciſſimum,</hi> a little
time, or a few days, will exhauſt
the Fountain of our tears, and drain
it dry, and overcome the moſt obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
grief. And <hi>Cicero</hi> ſays the ſame
thing. <hi>Quòd etiamſi nolis, tempore
tamen ipſo extenuatur &amp; evaneſcit,</hi>
that is, we muſt give over ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at laſt, whether we will or no,
and when we have wept ſo long
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:137153:68"/>
that we can weep no more; and
therefore 'tis a ſtark ſhame that our
reaſon ſhould not do that which a
little time will effect; that it ſhould
not put a ſtop to our tears, which
within a little while will dry up of
themſelves. <hi>Multum autem intereſt,
utrum tibi permittas moerere, an
imperes,</hi> ſays the ſame <hi>Seneca,</hi> 'tis
more honourable to ſuppreſs our
paſſions, than to let them run them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
out of breath and to ſink of
their own accord.</p>
            <p>And in another place, he tells
<hi>Marcia,</hi> that it is wiſdom to huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
our tears well, and not to let
them ſtream too plentifully, but to
be ſparing of them, and to reſerve
ſome againſt another time. <hi>Lachrymae
nobis deerunt antequam dolendi
cauſae.</hi> For if we live in the World,
we ſhall meet with many occaſions
to weep and mourn, and ſhall never
want matter of ſorrow and trouble.
And therefore we ſhould make it
evident by our ceaſing to mourn for
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:137153:69"/>
the dead in juſt and convenient
time, that our reaſon has that aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
over our Paſſion, as not to let
it run too far, or ſpend it ſelf quite
at once, whereas there may be great
reaſon and occaſion for it at ſome
other time.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, and to conclude all, Let
none ſuſpect that this Diſcourſe had
any aim to promote or introduce a
Stoical Apathy among Chriſtians,
whoſe Religion is a compleat body
of mercy, and a perfect ſyſteme of
tender-heartedneſs and compaſſions,
and teaches men to be pitiful and
compaſſionate and melting above
the common ſtandard of humanity.
Let none, I ſay, ſo miſconſtrue it, as
becauſe it argues againſt exceſſive
and immoderate mourning for the
dead, that therefore it intends to
harden mens hearts, and to bar them
from paying a juſt tribute of tears
and ſorrow to the memory of their
Deceaſed Friends; or becauſe it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
againſt effeminate weepings
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:137153:69"/>
and lamentations, that therefore it
will not allow us the ſenſe and feeling
of men. <hi>Nec verò credi velim,</hi> ſayes
<hi>Cicero, me, quia dolori nimio re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnem,
idcirco dolorem omni ex
parte improbare, omneſ<expan>
                     <am>

                  </expan> illius ex
animo filias evellendas exiſtimare,
&amp;c.</hi> But our deſign is chiefly to
perſwade men to curb and moderate
their Paſſions and ſorrows for the
Dead, by ſhewing, that if they
would but liſten to the Counſels and
Dictates of reaſon, it would inform
and convince them of the folly of
grieving and afflicting themſelves to
no purpoſe, and when all the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing
in the World will do no
good, <hi>Parcamus Lachrymis,</hi> ſayes
<hi>Seneca, nihil proficientibus;</hi> and
alſo how contradictory it is to the
Faith of a Chriſtian to continue
mourning for the Dead, as if they
were irreverſibly gone and loſt to all
intents and purpoſes of happineſs, as
if Death were an utter extinction and
annihilation of their beings, and as
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:137153:70"/>
if there were no immortality after
this ſhort and fading life is ended.
'Tis true, that the Stoicks injoined
their Diſciples to dam up the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
of their natural affections and
paſſions, and not to let them forth
in the leaſt degree upon any occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
whatſoever. And this Apathy
they pretended and boaſted to be
the aim and perfection of their Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy;
whereas the Chriſtian Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy
is not near ſo rigid, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
us to give way to our paſſions
in ſome meaſure, and upon juſt and
ſolemn occaſions. We read of the
Lamentations of <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> and how
that the Death of the good King
<hi>Joſiah</hi> was ſolemniz'd with great
mournings and lamentations, all
<hi>Iſrael</hi> mourned for <hi>Joſiah,</hi> and <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi>
lamented <hi>Joſiah, 2 Chro.</hi> 35. 24.
And that which doth more authorize
our Mourning for our Friends, is
the carriage and practice of thoſe
devout men in the Goſpel, who car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
<hi>Stephen</hi> to his Burial, and made
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:137153:70"/>
great Lamentation over him, <hi>Acts</hi>
8. 2. Nay a further Confirmation
of the lawfulneſs of mourning for
our deceaſed Friends, is the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of our Saviour himſelf, who
wept over <hi>Lazarus</hi>'s Grave, as we
may ſee <hi>John</hi> 11. 35. which the
ſtanders by made a great Argument
of his love and concernment for the
Death of <hi>Lazarus.</hi> And 'tis very well
known that the Jews lookt upon
tears and mourning to be ſo natural
and proper at a Funeral, that they
hired Women called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Jer.</hi> 9.
17. (and ſo had the <hi>Romans</hi> their
<hi>Praeficae</hi> for the very ſame purpoſe,)
to weep at Burials for the greater
ſolemnity, ſo that rather than there
ſhould be any want of tears upon
ſuch ſad occaſions, they Celebrated
the Obſequies of their Friends with
a mercenary ſorrow; and therefore
it was a ſevere and unnatural Injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of <hi>Tiberius</hi> to charge the
Friends and Relations of thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
that he put to Death, not to
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:137153:71"/>
mourn for them, or ſo much as ſhed
a tear at their Execution upon pain
of his higheſt diſpleaſure. <hi>Interdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum
ne capite damnatos lugerent,
Suetonius.</hi> Whereas our Religion
does not require us to put off bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els
of pity and compaſſion, as the
Philoſophy of the Stoicks, or the
cruelty of the Tyrant did; but only
prohibits us to pluck up the Sluces,
or to open the Flood-gate of our
Paſſions, ſo as to let them run with
a mighty Torrent, and to over-flow
the bounds of reaſon and modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
But then although we are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
by the Example of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
to ſympathize with the ſufferings
of humane nature, and to grieve
according to the proportions of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity,
for the loſs of our Friends
and Relations; yet we are to have
a ſpecial care that our ſorrows are
not unreaſonable or immoderate:
for as no ſorrow ſhews want of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity,
ſo too much ſhews the want
of Religion. For by our immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:137153:71"/>
grievings we ſeem to renounce
our Creed, or at leaſt to diſtruſt
the truth of one of its prime and
fundamental Articles, which is the
Reſurrection of the Dead. And
therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſeeing the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
in his days were apt to grow
exorbitant in their ſorrowings for
the Dead, thinks fit to give them
this inſtruction, 1 <hi>Theſſ. 4. 13. But
I would not have you to be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
Brethren, concerning them
which are aſleep, that ye ſorrow not,
even as others which have no hope.
For if we believe that Jeſus died
and roſe again, even ſo them alſo
which ſleep in Jeſus, will God bring
with him;</hi> in which words he does
plainly declare, that we do in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
confute and diſſolve our Belief
of the great Article of the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
if we lay the loſs of our
Friends ſo much to heart, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulph
our ſelves in ſorrows as thoſe
that have no hope. And indeed, what
can be more unlike, or contrary to
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:137153:72"/>
the Faith and Belief of Chriſtians,
than that unruly and exceſſive ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
of <hi>Rachel</hi> for the loſs of her
Children, whom the Scripture ſeems
not only to note, but to brand
and ſtigmatize for her impatience,
in that ſhe wept for her Children, and
would not be comforted, becauſe
they were not? Ah Lord! what a ſad
thing is this to contradict our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,
to ſay, we believe a Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
and yet ſorrow as if there
were none? But in ſhort, either we
believe a Reſurrection, or we do
not; if we do believe it, why do
we bewail the Death of our Friends
with ſo much bitterneſs and lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
as if they were utterly loſt
and gone, as if they were paſt all
joys and comfort, and were to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh

from a ſhort and fading to an Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
Life; we are then to repute
Death our beſt and deareſt Friend,
in that it leads and uſhers us to ſuch
Endleſs Happineſs. But if we do
not believe a Reſurrection, why are
we ſo raſh and formal as to own
an Article that we dare not rely
on? Ah! We little think that the
greateſt Atheiſt in the World can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
make a greater Argument a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
our Religion than we do our
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:137153:73"/>
ſelves, when we let looſe the reins
of our paſſions, and refuſe to be
comforted for the dead, and wound
and pierce our hearts thorough with
great and mighty ſorrows, thereby
teſtifying that we little believe a
Life to come, or a better State than
this is, or that our Friends have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chang'd
for the better: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we had beſt look to it, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to curb and check our paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
that we do not give occaſion
to our Enemies to blaſpheme and ſay,
where is that Heaven, that place of
reſt and bleſſedneſs which you ſo
much talk of? where is that Faith
of a future Life and a judgment to
come, which you ſo zealouſly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs?
how can you perſwade us that
you believe what you profeſs, ſeeing
that upon the trial you are ready to
kill your ſelves with very grief for
the Death of your Friends and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
and thereby give a ſtrong
ſuſpicion, that you think this World
the beſt Paradiſe for your Friends
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:137153:73"/>
to live in, and the other the beſt
only to talk of.</p>
            <p>To conclude, Let us endeavour
to poſſeſs our hearts and minds with
a firm hope and perſwaſion of a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
State and Eternal Life; and then
we ſhall be the freer to think of our
own Death, and be leſs troubled to
part with our Friends and Relations
when God thinks fit to take them
away. <hi>Simplicius</hi> in his Comment
upon <hi>Epictetus cap.</hi> 33. does rightly
obſerve, how variouſly we are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
at the Death of others and
the Death of our own Relations,
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
If we hear, ſayes he, of the
Death of anothers Wife or Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
we are not much concern'd,
but put it off very ſlightly, and
ſay, that their dying is no wonder
at all, and that there is no reaſon to
be much troubled at it, foraſmuch
as Death is natural and common to
all. But then, ſayes he, when we
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:137153:74"/>
happen to loſe any of our own Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
we ſeem to have another guiſe
opinion of Death, and to change
our note, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
that is, We
hear of and ſee the death and burial
of others patiently enough, and
without being much troubled or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
concern'd, but when it comes
home to our ſelves, and we loſe any
of our own dear Friends and Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
we are preſently in a ſtorm,
and riſe into a ſupream paſſion, and
in the bitterneſs of our Souls cry out,
that we are miſerable and undone,
and the unhappieſt people in the
World, and that there is no loſs like
our loſs, and that none has ſuch
great afflictions as we, and then there
is nothing to be heard or ſeen but
great Lamentations and Mourning,
and a huge Scene of ſorrows. In
which words, the Philoſopher does
rightly note our partiality to our
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:137153:74"/>
ſelves, and how that we eſteem and
look upon Death to be only unkind
and cruel to our ſelves and thoſe
that belong to us, and that we can
hear and think kindly enough of it
at a diſtance, but when it comes
nigh us, and touches us in our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
then we are all mutiny and
confuſion. And therefore it is a
great Argument of our folly and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcretion,
to waver and alter ſo
much in our opinion of Death, as
to entertain worſe thoughts of it
at one time than another. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit,
the more than ordinary ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
that is between us and our Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
may defend and juſtifie our
ſorrowing ſomewhat more for them
than for perfect Strangers; yet it is
againſt common ſenſe and reaſon,
that we ſhould be ſo deſperately diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted
at that Providence which
deprives us of our Relations, whereas
we are ſo little concern'd at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
fatality of Mankind. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it behoves us in point of Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:137153:75"/>
to labour to have always
the ſame thoughts and opinions of
Death, and to count it no more
cruel, no more an Enemy, when it
ſeizeth upon our own fleſh and
blood, than when it ſeizeth upon
the reſt of humane race: And if we
make no great matter of the death
of others whom we ſee daily fall to
the ground, looking upon it as a
natural thing for them to die: ſo let
us conſider, that 'tis every whit as
natural for our Relations to die, and
nothing happens to them but what
is common to all fleſh living. And
this conſideration the Philoſopher
looks upon as very juſt and reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
and preſcribes it as an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Remedy and Antidote againſt
all immoderate ſorrowing for the
loſs of our deareſt Friends and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations:
But alas! why do I urge
ſuch a poor conſideration as that of
Death being common to all men, to
aſſwage and mitigate our ſorrows for
the Dead, as if any conſideration in
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:137153:75"/>
the World could do it more effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
than our Chriſtian Hope and
the belief of another and better life
hereafter. Some indeed may at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
and endeavour to quiet and
ſilence their ſorrows by Arguments
drawn from reaſon, and the acute
ſayings of Philoſophers; and think
they may be able from meer natural
courage, and ſome bold principles,
to laugh at and deſpiſe Death as well
as the Stoicks did in their high rants
and ſullen moods: but no Arguments,
or the moſt ſtubborn Principles in
the World, can be of equal force
with our Chriſtian Hope for that
purpoſe. A Hope that opens to us
the Caſements of Heaven, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents
to us in a great meaſure the
glories of the Reſurrection; the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
and full knowledge whereof can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be attain'd in this narrow ſtate
of mortality, and is far tranſcending
all humane reach and comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;
ſo that for me to go about to
make a full and compleat deſcription
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:137153:76"/>
of the excellencies and perfections
appropriate to the future ſtate,
would be the ſame fondneſs as to
attempt to illuſtrate a Star with my
Finger: But yet for our great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
and incouragement at preſent,
the Scripture gives us this plain no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
and information of a glorious
transformation as to our vile and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtrial
part; How that then our vile
Bodies ſhall be chang'd, and made
like unto Chriſts glorious Body, that
this mortal ſhall put on immortality,
and this corruptible incorruption.
How then can we that have this Hope
faint in our mind, or ſo much as
ſhed a tear at the departure of our
Friends out of this miſerable Life,
ſeeing it will be ſo much for their
advantage, ſo very much for their
preferment to leave us? For they
that are accounted worthy to obtain
that World, and the Reſurrection
from the Dead, ſhall ſtrangely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
themſelves, and ſurpaſs all
the excellencies of humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:137153:76"/>
at preſent, and be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
to the Angels, and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
bear the Image and Form of
Chriſt himſelf. And this equality to
Angels, and likeneſs to Chriſt, is no
more than what we have ſure and
certain grounds to hope for from
the plain and poſitive words of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture;
and therefore we ſeem either
not to believe or elſe to envy the
happineſs of thoſe that depart this
Life, when we are in ſuch extream
Agonies of ſorrow for their removal
from us. Wherefore let this Hope
be always our ſupport and comfort,
that Death is a certain advantage to
our Friends that have ſo lived as to
die the Death of the Righteous; and
that they are freed from the leaſt
touch or feeling of thoſe ſickneſſes,
and pains, and Diſeaſes, and Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
and from thoſe toils and
hardſhips which this mortal frail con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
expoſes us unto. And having
this Hope and belief of a better life
hereafter, Let us rather bleſs God
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:137153:77"/>
for delivering our deareſt Friends from
this preſent evil World, and taking
them away from the evil to come; Let
us, I ſay, bleſs God for doing that ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
favour to our Friends whom we
lov'd ſo well, as to tranſlate them to
Glory and Happineſs before us, and in
giving them ſuch an early poſſeſſion of
that Crown of Life which we all ſo much
ſtrive and pray to attain, rather than re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine
at Gods Providence in not letting
them ſtay any longer with us in this Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley
of Tears. Let us look upon Death
rather as a mercy than a Judgment to our
Friends which die in the Lord, for they
ſhall reſt from their Labours, and have
all Tears wip't away from their Eyes,
and ſhall never know the meaning of a
ſorrow or trouble any more; in a word,
Let us look upon Death as a Friend ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than an Enemy to our Relations,
which puts a period to the days of their
Pilgrimage, which are but few and evil
at the beſt, and eſteem it a bleſſed change,
which is the term of their Bondage, the
end of their Cares, the concluſion of
their Sorrows, and the beginning of end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
Happineſs, and which paſſes them
through the Gates of Death to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Glory.</p>
