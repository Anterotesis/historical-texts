            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A REMONSTRANCE TO THE CREDITORS <hi>OF THE</hi> COMMON-WEALTH OF <hi>ENGLAND,</hi> Concerning the Publique Debts of the Nation.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>IS Excellencies New Repreſentative being now Diſſolved, and their Supream Power envolved in him, as the ſapp of a Tree runs to the root in cold Winter; It is not for the Creditors of the Common-wealth of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to deſpaire of their due Debts, and think themſelves undone by what is done, but rather turne their preſent fears into future hopes, conſidering that the late diſeaſed, and deceaſed Parliament before their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution in their laſt Will and Teſtament, made their Noble Generall who is now our <hi>Lord Protector</hi> their ſole Executor, whom I hope will be carefull to ſee you ſatisfied, and the grievances of the people removed.</p>
            <p>In him therefore you muſt confide, and render that honour, worſhip, and fear which is due unto his Highneſs under God, and to him and his Counſel repaire and Petition for Juſtice, and due ſatisfaction of your juſt Debts, according to that way and manner preſcribed in my <hi>Remonstrance</hi> of the 22 of <hi>June</hi> laſt, and much more abundant, that you may not run in vaine but obtaine your juſt deſires.</p>
            <p>For preparation hereunto, it is meet that you be throughly ſenſible of what the late Parliament hath done for you.</p>
            <p>That well pen'd Act for <hi>Ireland,</hi> of the 26 of <hi>Septemb.</hi> laſt, you ought not to forget, conſidering that therein they have granted Lands to you at an eaſie rate, for your Publick Faith Bils and Debenters, which I ſuppoſe will be good Accomoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for thoſe who intend there to inhabit or plant. And it is remarkable what ſpeciall proviſion they have made therein for deſolate Widows, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But to ſpeak as the truth is, they have not therein made Proviſion for ſtating your Debenters, who have not ſerved in <hi>Ireland,</hi> only they doe (in a manner) promiſe it Yet by the Act of the 19 of <hi>October</hi> laſt, they have impowered the Committee of the Army, to cauſe the Accompts of all Officers and Souldiers that either are or were in the Service of this Common-wealth at any time ſince the 15 of <hi>January,</hi> 1647. to be ſtated, audited, and caſt up. But not for thoſe that were disbanded before.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſſe though ſome were contented to accept of Lands in <hi>Ireland,</hi> the reſt would not be ſo ſatisfied, but expected payment of their Bils and Debenters, from the Forreſts and Chaſes, which was given by the old Parliament, for Collaterall Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, in the Act of the 17 of <hi>July,</hi> 1649. But incontinently this late diſſolved Parliament have put the Publick Faith upon doubling thereupon, wherein it is to be feared there will be double dealing, and that the needy Creditors will be expoſed (as it were) to be ſold for a little ſilver, and the poor for the price of a paire of ſhooes; for they being not able to double, muſt be conſtrained in the midſt of their great extreamities to ſell their Publick Debts at an inconſiderable value, with many ſighes and tears into the bargaine: And of all the Forreſts they have reſerved but four for the Collaterall Security for the Souldiers Bils chargeable upon the late Kings Lands, and that with ſuch delatory Conditions, whereby their expectations are fruſtrate, though they earned their Wages with the hazard of their lives and deareſt blood.</p>
            <p>The Act of the 7 of <hi>Octob:</hi> laſt, which is for Publick Creditors to bring or ſend in their Claimes of their Debts to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners therein named, is ſaid to be for the due ſtating and clearing of Publick Debts in order to their payment. It alſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth payment to the diſcoverer of his own proper Debt: But as the Act of Marriage is deficient, without telling how long they ſhall hold together, So this Act is lame in divers reſpects: It tels you of ſtating, and of paying, but not by whom, nor when, Therefore it is not amiſſe for you to Petition for an additionall Act, or that the remaines of that Bill which was read, &amp; Ordered to be read againe by the old Parliament, <hi>Nov:</hi> 30<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1642. may paſſe for your better Security. And the 12 Undertakers be ſufficiently impowered, upon this, certain men have ingag'd to diſcover 500000. <hi>l.</hi> for payment of publick debts. I know many of you are very neceſſitous, and others, though more able, cannot ſpare money out of their Trading to double. You have waited many years with much patience, &amp; I have laboured many Months, &amp; attained experience of the ſaid Calamities of the people more then before, I have in my progreſſe ſeen a diſſolution of a Golden Parliament, coveting profit, And a Parliament choyce as ſilver, labouring for Credit, conſiſting (as was ſaid) moſt of religious and conſcientious men, in whom the beſt affected had hopes of good, But a houſe divided againſt it ſelf cannot ſtand. The Newes of this will goe to <hi>Rome,</hi> but let not the uncircumciſed in heart rejoyce and triumph. Moſt men upon this diſſolution take occaſion to cry Aha Aha, and to ſpeak their pleaſure, but prudence may teach them when and how to ſpeak. Indeed the occaſion of their diſſolution is known to many, but few do rightly conſider the cauſe to be That in matters fundamental they laid aſide Gods moſt righteous Law, and leaned to their own: wherefore their diſſolution was of God, who ſaith, <hi>I will have mercy &amp; not ſacrifice.</hi> It proceeds from the Lord of Hoſts, who hath determined to ſtayne the pride of all glory, &amp; to bring into contempt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>all the Honorable of the Earth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
