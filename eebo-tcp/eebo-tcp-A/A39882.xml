         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:59194:3"/>
which in al places they are ſo impudently bold, as to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their Rebellion upon his ſacred Majeſty, as if all they did, were in obedience to his Majeſties commands, which by way of implicite faith: although they never ſaw any ſuch warrants, they are bound to believ, becauſe their Prieſts and prime Commanders doe informe them; the ſecond, their Prieſts indeavour to perſwade them there is no diſtruction nor hope of pardon; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to drive all to ſuch deſperate courſes, as they will bee rather kill'd then taken, and encourage one another to enter into a bond, for killing all his majeſties Brittiſh ſubjects, and proteſtunt profeſſours. An happy agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment betweene his Majeſty and the Parliament would quickely take of the maſque, and ſo weaken the power, that the greater part of the ſeduced Gentry and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons would leave them, and a diſcreete liberty given to Governours of Counties, and Provinces, to pardon ſome ſpeciall Perſons, and Corporations upon honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable termes, would untye their bond, and make every one of them, cut anothers throats to ſecure their owne pardon: the Towne of <hi>Galway</hi> hath by the Earle of <hi>Clanricard</hi> and Saint <hi>Albons</hi> meanes made a pacificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the Fort, but upon ſuch diſhonourable termes, that it hath rather beene a ſubtile ſtrengthning of their rebellion, then a truly intended pacification. Although in every Province where I come, I deſire the aſſiſtance of, and to be aſſiſtant to the chiefe Governours thereof: and have accordingly in that Province of <hi>Conaght,</hi> find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Majeſties Fort, and the Town of <hi>Galway</hi> at odds againe, being called thither for the reliefe and aſſiſtance of his Majeſties Fort, advertiſe the Earle of <hi>Clanricard</hi> Governour of the Towne and County of <hi>Galway,</hi> and my Lord <hi>Rannelagh</hi> Preſident of <hi>Connaght,</hi> who did
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59194:3"/>
concur in their opinions, that the loyalty of the Towne of <hi>Galway</hi> could never be ſecured without a garriſon, if they knew how to obtain it, my Lord <hi>Clanricard</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining that his friendes had left him, and the reſt would leave him, if the pacification were broke: and my Lord <hi>Rannelagh</hi> complaining that his Souldiers lacked all neceſſarie proviſions, mony, food and cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and but small proportions of Amunition, my ſmall force not being in any probable way ſufficient to compell them to receive a garriſon: I ſilently ſuffred the Earle of <hi>Clanricard,</hi> and the Captaine of the Fort, to patch up their broken Pacification, by which the Fort is ſufficiently relieved; leaving the Fort of <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way</hi> in theſe termes of peace and plenty, I ſent to the Iſles of <hi>Arran,</hi> and did great ſpoile in burning the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells cabines, and corne, and brought from thence two hundred cowes, and ſome ſheepe. But the Rebells (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept twenty that were kil'd, fled in boates from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide of the Iſland, ſome eight miles diſtant, the ſtormes being ſo great, that in eight daies time I could ſcarce gaine the mouth of the River of <hi>Limerick:</hi> where I am ſtill doing all the harme I can to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells: but ſeeing the warres are not like to be ſoon en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as was firſt ſuppoſed: if your Lordſhips will take a courſe for the ſtrengthning of theſe forces at preſent under my command to the full proportion contained in the ordinances of Parliament.
