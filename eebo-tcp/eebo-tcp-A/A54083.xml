            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </head>
            <p>THE ſhare I have had in this Controverſy, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending between <hi>G. K.</hi> and his <hi>quondam</hi> Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, the People called Quakers, hath not been ſo much Argumentative (that I found ready done to my hands) as to turn his own Weapon upon himſelf, and detect the Inconſtancy and Contradiction of the Man, who while pretending to give <hi>a Liſt of</hi> others <hi>groſs and vile Errors</hi> (as in his <hi>True Copy,</hi> p. 17.) and reflecting on ſeveral of our Friends by name (without excepting any) as <hi>holding groſs and vile Errors, oppoſite to ſome of the fundamental Doctrines of Chriſtianity, and yet ſo Hypocritical, as not to own and retract in publick their Errors expoſed in publick, even leſt ſuch Retraction and Correction ſhould leſſen their Honour and Eſteem among their too credulous Followers and Admirers</hi> (ſee <hi>Preface</hi> to <hi>Groſs Errors,</hi> p. 2.) yet had not then eſſayed to correct his own, which by his own confeſſion (<hi>True Copy,</hi> p. 17.) <hi>Needed both further Explanation, and in ſome part</hi> (as he mincingly worded it) <hi>an Emendation and Correction.</hi> This gave me occaſion, after having inſpected his Books, wherein I found many Contradictions both doctrinal and perſonal, as well as Abſurdities, to be engaged in laying them before himſelf and others (the which I exhibited in three Tracts, the one entituled <hi>Apoſtate Expoſed,</hi> the other <hi>People called Quakers Cleared,</hi> and the third <hi>Keith againſt Keith,</hi> the firſt and laſt of which he is ſtill Debtor to) who have more than once called upon him for them (they having been promiſed in the third Month 1695) and at length told him, upon the great Joy and Peace he pretended to have in his publiſhing a lame Retraction of his former Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of two Scriptures (which yet fell abundantly ſhort of what had been propoſed by him) <hi>That perhaps, had I
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:93161:3"/>
not forced him to it, by expoſing of him, he had ſtayed yet another Twelve-month, before he had given them,</hi> as in my <hi>Keith againſt Keith,</hi> p. 90, 91.</p>
            <p>Now, after long Importunity (like the Widow to the unjuſt Judge) he emits ſomething which he entitules, <hi>Explications and Retractations of divers Paſſages contained in his former Books,</hi> which that it may not want for noiſe, and perhaps to ſtave off the work he is already clogged with, he gives out <hi>may at preſent ſuffice for a Reply to</hi> T. E<hi>'s and my late and former Books,</hi> Five of which now ſtick upon his hands. Yet leſt he ſhould ſeem wholly to fore-cloſe himſelf from a <hi>larger Anſwer,</hi> he tells us, p. 42. <hi>he hopes to do it,</hi> E'RE VERY LONG.</p>
            <p>This naturally leads me to call to mind, how he hath ſerved <hi>T. E.</hi> with reſpect to two of his, which he told us, in his <hi>Poſtſcript</hi> to his <hi>Groſs Errors,</hi> printed <hi>Anno</hi> 1695, it was PROBABLE a due anſwer might be given to in due time, which due time is not yet come with him, but he hath laboured to ſhift it by more Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifices than one. For ſeeing what juſt ground I may have (at leaſt) to ſuſpect him the Compoſer of thoſe ſeven Queries propoſed by the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi>'s Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain to our <hi>Yearly Meeting</hi> Anno 1695, and made publick by himſelf, which he improved to cut himſelf out new work, while the old lay on his hands (as if it had been therefore deſigned) 'tis manifeſt from his Summoning us to meet him at <hi>Turners-Hall,</hi> alledging <hi>want of Time and ability of Eſtate to print anſwers to us,</hi> and his ſince telling us (in his Book <hi>Antichriſts and Sadducees,</hi> p. 21.) that he hath <hi>offered to anſwer Vivâ voce, that there is no end of anſwering in print, few will be at the pains to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare book with book, and the Charge is too great for him,</hi> that he would fain have ſhifted that free and open way of anſwering by the Preſs, which he had drawn us into, and where we had purſued him, by appointing, without our conſent, a day to Arraign us at his Bar,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:93161:3"/>
wherein had we complied, he might (as I once told him) have run off from the Cauſe he was hampered with and uneaſie under, and by wrangling a-freſh upon ſome out-skirts of the Controverſie, have drop'd the main one. Now this Project failing, What doth he do? Betake himſelf to anſwer <hi>T. E.</hi> in Print? Nothing leſs: But then he tries, whether he can ſet the Church of <hi>England</hi> and the Proteſtant Diſſenters upon our Backs, informeth them, <hi>Vile Errors are boldly and avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly promoted among a ſort or Gang of Quakers, as are not only as bad as any Popery, but M<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>CH WORSE than the WORST of Popery,</hi> in divers reſpects, animates them to <hi>ſuppreſs our Books and diſturb our Meetings, elſe Papiſts will out-do them in Zeal,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Ant. &amp; Sadd.</hi> p. 40, 41. It is after all this, when none of theſe ways would take, that the poor Man is fain to pretend he hath an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered them all at once, in the Book before me.</p>
            <p>To which he prefixeth a <hi>Preface,</hi> wherein he excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth his <hi>delay, as having found divers more Paſſages that needed an Explanation, and ſome of them a Correction, above what he had diſcovered, when he publiſhed his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</hi> So that it is to be hoped, it is now effectually done, in his own Judgment. But it ſeems our <hi>great Brags, telling of great matter of Contradictions and other Abſurdities, found in his Books, juſtly occaſioned a longer delay.</hi> Which I think ſhould rather have forwarded him. I will aſſure him, had he collected thoſe Paſſages out of his Books, ready to my hands, which I was fain to tumble over his Books for, it had eaſed me, and facilitated my work. As to his telling his Reader, <hi>We <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

falſly to Accuſe, than juſtly to Prove, he might have ſuſpended his Brag, till he had brought his Proof along with him.</p>
            <p>Thus much to excuſe his Delay; now for beginning with us, before he had ſwept his own Houſe; he alledges four things: 1. <hi>That his free Acknowledgment might excuſe him from beginning with his own Books, till he had brought us to an equal Acknowledgment, or upon our ſtubborn and pertinacious Conceit of our Books, he might the more juſtly expoſe us, as guilty not only of Errors, but of hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them pertinaciouſly.</hi> All which, with reſpect to us, is meerly precarious, a begging of the queſtion, who him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf had once acquitted us, and that even from the Errors he would now faſten upon us, yea and out of ſome of the ſame Books he then cited in our Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and we ſtill continue to defend as unjuſtly impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to us, whereas his own (let him call them Errors, or ſome more diminutive name, if he pleaſe) he hath aſſigned as needing both Explication, Emendation and Correction. His ſecond, Aſſigning his own to be <hi>Motes,</hi> ours <hi>Beams,</hi> is too idle for me to take notice of, as thinking his Teſtimony on his own behalf not valid. His Thirdly, alledging our <hi>Excommunicating</hi> him, is as ſhallow: For had not that drawn him to be Vindictive, it would rather have ſtirred him up, by a free and open Retraction, to have approved himſelf, to have exceeded us in Confeſſing and Forſaking. And his laſtly is all of a piece with his ſecond, That <hi>what he hath retracted or renounced, was never judged by him an Article of Faith,</hi> and that <hi>we have not proved him contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting in his latter Books, any Article of Faith aſſerted in his former Books.</hi> To which I reply, Had he not done his work by halves, he would have found cauſe to have retracted his doctrinal Errors, Errors which every body elſe, that knows what Errors are, will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to relate to Articles of Faith, and which as ſuc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

we have exhibited and argued upon, which muſt be left to the indifferent Reader's Judgment, who hath read his and our Books. In the mean time I enter upon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining thoſe before me, which he hath here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to explain or correct, which I alſo ſubmit to the Judicious, whether they relate not to Articles of Faith, and alſo whether <hi>G.

K.</hi>) to aſſert that the Scriptures out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Teſtimony is moſt neceſſary, and that no true and ſaving Knowledge of God is to be attained, but by the Scriptures being read or heard: Then it is <hi>G. K.</hi> his Senſe, and not a Mis-conſtruction thereof, that a Saving Knowledge of God may be attained, by Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Revelation, without the help of the Scriptures, and that the Scriptures outward Teſtimony, is not moſt neceſſary, in his Judgment. And this Saving Knowledge muſt be a Knowledge of the Chriſtian Religion, except he be prepared to retract his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction.</p>
               <p>But <hi>to obviate this Offence and Miſtake</hi> (as he terms it) <hi>he recommends the Reader to what he hath ſaid, from</hi> p. 38. <hi>to</hi> p. 42. <hi>of that Book</hi> (but cites no paſſage out of it) <hi>where I diſtinguiſh,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>of means intermitting and tranſmitting, and ſhew that it is the intermitting means, that hinders the Revelation to be Immediate, but not the tranſmitting. Anſw.</hi> Here he Shuffles, the Debate here is not whether Revelation be Immediate or no, when tranſmitted through organized Inſtruments, either the Holy Scriptures or Men divinely inſpired, but whether he hath aſſerted, ſuch an Immediate Revelation is not ceaſed, as is received with either the one or the other.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:93161:5"/>
That the Reader may inform himſelf of, even in p. 40, within the compaſs of <hi>G. K.</hi> his Reference, for he there ſaith,
<q>We find that he ſometimes uſeth outward means, and ſometimes he uſeth them not, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigheth unto us, from and through his own Seed and Birth in us, the living Manifeſtations and Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications of his Life, Will and Council, many, yea MOST TIMES without all Means, or Inſtruments from without, for moſt times we are left alone as to Inſtruments or Means without us.</q>
I would adviſe him therefore, in his next, either to retract this Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, which is within the Pages he hath ſo lately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended to us, or his referring us thereto to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate the pretended Miſtake and Offence; for this Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage will hamper him elſe.</p>
               <p>Now let us ſee whether he mends the matter by his other Book, called, <hi>Divine Immediate Revelation,</hi> for he tells us that in p. 44. thereof as an inſtance, <hi>He did own the Holy Scriptures to be a neceſſary means to give us the true Knowledge and Faith of Chriſtian Doctrines and Principles:</hi> But that his own Citation ſaith not, but only that <hi>all other Doctrine and Heads of the Chriſtian Religion</hi> (which he calls <hi>ſpecial,</hi> the other <hi>general Religion) are made known to us by the Scripture means, the Holy Spirit inwardly inlightning and inſpiring,</hi> &amp;c. Which doth not prove that they are a neceſſary means, a <hi>ſine quâ non,</hi> that without which the Knowledge cannot be conveighed, but that they are profitable and uſeful means, when at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with Divine Illumination and Inſpiration, and therefore not <hi>ad rem.</hi> What he would have <hi>noted, that twelve Years ago he diſtinguiſhed between Gentile and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion</hi> (ſaith he, between <hi>ſpecial</hi> and <hi>general</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, ſay I) <hi>though ſome call this a new Doctrine in him ſo to diſtinguiſh,</hi> I think hath little of weight in it, except he had told us who his Accuſers were. For my part, I do not account it a <hi>New Doctrine</hi> in him, to diſtinguiſh
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:93161:6"/>
between ſpecial and general Religion, yet I do eſteem it a <hi>Contradiction</hi> to ſay, as in p. 63. of that Book,
<q>
                     <hi>Cornelius</hi> received the Spirit immediately, and yet ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained it further by means of <hi>Peter</hi>'s Preaching.</q>
[And again to aſſert,]
<q>It is an Error to ſay, <hi>Cornelius</hi> had the Holy Ghoſt in his Gentile State, but the Holy Ghoſt was promiſed PARTICULARLY to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers in him, to ſuch ONLY who believe in Chriſt crucified and raiſed again, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
                  <hi>Truth Advanced,</hi> p. 70. neither of which he hath yet retracted.</p>
               <p>He goes on, <hi>Seeing the word Immediate Revelation is no Scripture Term (though Revelation is) I can freely conſent that the word Immediate be not preſſed, or impoſed on any. Anſw.</hi> This is idle all over. We are not entring into a Strife of words with him, but will he retract the <hi>things?</hi> will he ſay, <hi>Revelation</hi> is not <hi>Immediate,</hi> now a days? which in two former Books he hath aſſerted that it is, and entitled one of them, <hi>Immediate Revelation not ceaſed,</hi> the other, <hi>Divine Immediate Revelation continued in the True Church</hi>; and told us the ill Conſequences of deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, aſſigning it as <hi>ſuch a Fundamental Error, that the greateſt part of their other Errors are built on it, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the whole Superſtructure of their Church and Miniſtry, as to its outward Conſtitution,</hi> (ſee <hi>Preface</hi> to <hi>Imm. Rev.</hi> p. 1.) This were he ſincere, he would either retract or fairly maintain, but inſtead of that, he playeth upon words, and acts the Sophiſter, to his great Shame, were he not paſt it. For whereas, even in p. 42. of <hi>Imm. Rev.</hi> a Page he recommends us to even now, he could then ſay,
<q>Theſe who miniſter not immediately from the immediate Communications of Life, in their own Hearts can do us no good, for they cannot Miniſter and tranſmit the Communications of Life, who have it not in themſelves; ſuch are <hi>Wells without Water,</hi> and <hi>Clouds without Rain,</hi> ſaid he then.</q>
Now ſuch Miniſters, who he knows ſtill oppoſe <hi>Immediate Revelation,</hi> and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:93161:6"/>
deny an immediate Call, are by him reputed <hi>Pious,</hi> which is far from being Wells without Water and Clouds without Rain (for to ſuch was <hi>reſerved the Blackneſs of Darkneſs for ever,</hi> Jude 12.13.) and perhaps given with a deſign to lick their Fingers, as well as that he hath laboured to irritate them againſt us, for to ſuppreſs our Books and diſturb our Meetings, that he might be eaſed of that Task he is ſo uneaſie under, and hath hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto ſo unſucceſsfully wearied himſelf with.</p>

Rev.</hi> viz. <hi>His blaming them who ſay the Scriptures are a filled-up Canon,</hi> &amp;c. And p. 4. of the Book it ſelf, <hi>Though no new Eſſentials are to be added, yet a new and fuller and clearer Teſtimony may be added concerning the ſame old Eſſentials.</hi> This laſt paſſage he clips egregiouſly, for he there ſaid,
<q>Now though we ſay, That the Scriptures are a full and perfect Teſtimony of all the Eſſentials of the Chriſtian Religion, yet we believe (<hi>contrary to theſe of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional way</hi>) that they are not a Canon ſo filled up, as no more is to be added unto them, from the ſame immediate Inſpiration of the Spirit of God through his Servants, of the SAME AUTHORITY with them, for though no new Eſſentials are to be added, yet a new and fuller and clearer Teſtimony may be added, concerning the ſame old-Eſſentials.</q>
Now, as it is not his preſent Intereſt to give his Belief contrary to thoſe of the National way, for he craves their help againſt us; ſo inſtead of being ſo ſincere as to retract it, he ſlips it over in ſilence. And that his Belief now, and his Belief then, may not ſeem to interfere, he puts a Trick upon his Reader, concealing thoſe words, where

He here bids us <hi>Note, By this perfect ſubſtantial Birth he did not mean (as he now doth not) any Subſtance NEWLY PROD<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>CED—but only a vital <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion of Subſtantial Principles formerly exiſting.

Let him therefore keep to his own Rule better, or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver pretend to correct others Logick: For as is the Man's Cauſe, ſo is his way of defending it.</p>

               </p>
               <p>His following Aſſertion (<hi>that to believe in Chriſt, as he gave his Body of Fleſh outwardly to be broken for us, and his Blood outwardly to be ſhed for the Remiſſion of our Sins, is the eating of his Fleſh and drinking of his Blood, as well as the inward Enjoyment of his Life in us,</hi> and that <hi>this is clear from</hi> John 6.29, 35, 40, 47, 48.) I muſt a little compare with what he hath ſaid elſewhere. In his Book entituled <hi>Rector Corrected,</hi> Printed <hi>Anno</hi> 1680 (a paſſage not yet retracted) he blames his Adverſary p. 19. for ſaying, <hi>He would prove that the Fleſh and Blood ſpoken of,</hi> John 6. <hi>are not a ſpiritual, inviſible Subſtance,</hi> retorting thus,
<q>Then what muſt we infer from this Interpretation of thine, but that we muſt eat viſible Fleſh and drink viſible Blood?</q>
But hear him further, <hi>ibid.</hi>
                  <q>When the <hi>Capernaanites</hi> underſtood it of viſible Fleſh and Blood, he told them, <hi>He that eateth my Fleſh and drinketh my Blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him,</hi> to ſignifie that it was an inward and inviſible Eating, of an inward inviſible Subſtance, whereof he did ſpeak:</q>
For proof of which he then quoted <hi>John</hi> 61, 62, 63. at large. Again P. 21. he ſaith,
<q>Chriſt's giving his Fleſh for the Life of the World, is more than to offer up his viſible Fleſh upon the Croſs, for he giveth his Fleſh to eat, and his Blood to drink, whereas many that believe Hiſtorically, that his viſible Fleſh was offered upon the Croſs, do not eat his Fleſh, and drink his Blood, for they have not Life in them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
So that with <hi>G. K.</hi> one while eating his Fleſh and drinking his Blood, is an inward and inviſible eating of an inward and inviſible Subſtance, and it is proved to be ſo out of <hi>John</hi> 6. and his Adverſary branded with <hi>Capernaanitiſm</hi>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:93161:11"/>
for denying the Fleſh and Blood there ſpoken of, to be a ſpiritual, inviſible Subſtance: Anon, Chriſt ſpake there of a Belief in him, as his Body of Fleſh and Blood was broken and ſhed outwardly (it is not <hi>Capernaani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm</hi> in him, it ſeems, ſo to aſſert, though it was in the <hi>Rector</hi>) and that very Scripture is referred to for proof, that he did ſo, and yet <hi>G. K.</hi> no Changeling the mean while, if ye will believe him; who not only acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth (<hi>That the Fleſh which he ſaid they were to eat, and his Blood they were to drink, was that which he had before he deſcended,</hi> Imm. Rev. p. 228.) but alſo in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Page hath it,
<q>That they did eat his Fleſh and drink his Blood as TRULY and REALLY in meaſure before he came in that Body of Fleſh which was born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> as the Saints have done ſince.</q>
Again p. 258.
<q>This Body of Chriſt, of which we partake, is NOT THAT which he took up when he came in the Fleſh outwardly, but that which he had from the beginning, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

<q>And though I cite Scriptures, and make uſe of them in Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing this Point, yet I can truly ſay, I have not my Knowledge from them; who had ſaid but a Line or two above (which he giveth not here) I have not fetcht them from my own Wiſdom, neither hath it taught me them.</q>
Now he bids us <hi>Note, He ſays from them, as being the Efficient Cauſe, but he did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that he had his Knowledge by them,</hi> Inſtrumentally, <hi>to wit, the Doctrinal Knowledge and Faith he had of Goſpel Truths, and Principles of Chriſtianity, for that is abundantly Acknowledged in</hi> MANY PLACES (ſaith he, but he names not one) <hi>in that Book.

Where the Intelligent may perceive, he (in like manner) uſeth <hi>from</hi> for <hi>by,</hi> for the words were uttered <hi>by</hi> Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and ſo he muſt intend, or as great a Grammarian as he is, he muſt have writ Non-ſenſe: As well as that ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Scripture-Record, he ſaith, <hi>They point only at that which reveals.</hi> They did not then, it ſeems (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to him) <hi>give</hi> the Knowledge, give the Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but point only or direct to that which gave it.

Who in his Gradation deſcends to this Query, ſaying,
<q>To come to Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, who ſpoke to them in the days of his Fleſh, Did his words reveal him, or his Father unto them?</q>
But what is this to prove, that the Knowledge of Chriſt after the Fleſh, was needful to all Mens Salvation, either explicitly or implicitly, when as that was no ſubject of the Argument, but only of Scripture words ſpoken by himſelf in the days of his Fleſh, or by others before and ſince? Who (when he comes <hi>to ſumm all that is ſaid in this Argument</hi> (they are

<q>The Goſpel was preached unto <hi>Abraham, Abel, Enoch, Noah,</hi> and to all Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers who lived before Scripture was writ in a Book<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that it was ſpoken into their Hearts by the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

Will he now maintain that they had both the Scripture Words and the Spirit and Light, in order to make it Goſpel? Could not Chriſt in ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into their Hearts be conceived without ſome Form of Words, or was it not Goſpel till ſo conceived?</p>

Whence I Query, Cannot the Goſpel (which is the Power of God unto Salvation) reveal the Father, or doth that Goſpel point only at that which reveal?
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:93161:15"/>
Or is that which reveals the Father, (which he ſaith the beſt of words cannot do) as it is opened in Man by the Son, no Goſpel, till outwardly preached or written? Thus for want of Sincerity to retract, and by labouring to defend as Congruous what is ſo Contradictory, is the Man entangled, and the more he toils, the more he is perplext. His ſecond Reference, inſtead of doing him any good, further lays him open. For though he doth there aſſert the <hi>Light,</hi> as the <hi>Principal thing,</hi> yet not <hi>in ordine ad idem,</hi> not with relation to the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> for which end he here adduceth it, for there was no Diſſertation thereof there.

<q>One takes himſelf to read Commentators to furniſh him for the Miniſtry, another to read <hi>Hypocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen</hi> to become a Phyſician, while their hands are out from the Light of Chriſt, which gives true Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Ability to Miniſter either to the Soul or Body, and is the principal thing.</q>

<q>Now the Bowels of the Father's Love ſtirred in Compaſſion to the Work of his Hands, that of the pure Creation in Man, which tho ſhut up in Death, yet it remained and periſhed not as to its Being— and this is the loſt which God ſent his Son into the World to ſave, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
Now in §. 11. he explains himſelf to have <hi>meant there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, the Soul of Man, that is a Created Being, and that he called it that of the pure Creation, not that it had not been defiled by ſin, but by reaſon of its great worth, in reſpect of its Original and Primitive State, and its near capacity to be cleanſed and purified.</hi> Anſw. I might here ſhew that this is Doctrinally unſound, that Man's Body was Created pure as well as his Soul, that ſin defiled both the whole Creation (not the Souls only) <hi>groaning and travailing in pain together, that the Creature it ſelf alſo ſhall be delivered from the Bondage of Corruption into the Glorious Liberty of
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:93161:17"/>
the Sons of God,</hi> Rom. 8.21, 22. So that as Man's Sin <hi>deſtroys both Soul and Body,</hi> Matt. 10.28. the Reſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion affects both, but I chuſe, after this tranſient Touch, to oppoſe <hi>G. K.</hi> to <hi>G. K.</hi> and ſhew what he then meant by the <hi>Loſt,</hi> and that he did not intend the Soul of Man, as he here ſuggeſts. For in p. 71. he ſaith,
<q>When God created Man, he created him in his own Image, he put his Image, Chriſt the expreſs Image of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in Man, and he breathed in him the Breath or Spirit of Life, then did Man live indeed, he was a living Soul.</q>
By which it appears he did not then mean <hi>by living Soul,</hi> that which he now calls <hi>a created Being,</hi> but <hi>the Soul of that Soul,</hi> Chriſt, God's Image put in Men, who there adds,
<q>And the Light of Men was his Life, lived in him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
Again p. 75. after having declared <hi>what is not to be ſaved,</hi> viz. <hi>The Old Adam, the Birth of the Serpent's begetting,</hi> he ſaith,
<q>That which Chriſt came to ſave is that of God, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from him, the Seed of God in Man, whereof <hi>Abraham</hi>'s old decayed Body and <hi>Sarah</hi>'s barren Womb was a Type.</q>
So that here's no mention of <hi>Bodies</hi> nor of <hi>Souls,</hi> but of the <hi>Birth</hi> of the Serpent and the <hi>Seed</hi> of God: And as what was ſpoken of the Birth of the Serpents begetting is not applicable to the Body, ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is what was ſaid of the Seed of God in Man, appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable to the Soul of Man, although in his next §. he would fain perſwade us to be ſo impoſed upon.</p>

<q>Chriſt cauſeth to fructifie and bring forth <hi>Iſaac,</hi> the Seed of Promiſe.</q>
So that he was not ſpeaking of the Soul of Man, nor of <hi>Iſaac</hi> the Begotten, but of the Seed, the Begetter, the Fructifier, which he terms, <hi>ibid.</hi>

And in p. 76.
<q>The Body of Sin is a Burden to it, and ſo the Light ſhineth forth in the Darkneſs, to viſit the Seed ſhut up therein.</q>
By all which it is obvious what he intended by the Loſt God ſent Chriſt to ſave, <hi>viz.</hi> That Seed Man had loſt, Man had ſlain as to himſelf, and that by the Pure Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Man, which though ſhut up in Death, yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained and periſhed not, he meant ſomewhat of a more noble Extraction in Man, to which the Body of Sin is a Burden, and not the Soul to whom it is no Burden, while it is ſhut up in Death.

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:93161:18"/>
therefore think much to tranſcribe a Paſſage or two al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready given in our former Books, and not yet retracted by him. In his <hi>Way caſt up,</hi> p. 99. he ſaith,
<q>Though the outward Coming of the Man Chriſt was deferred, according to his outward Birth in the Fleſh for many Ages, yet from the Beginning this Heavenly Man, the PROMISED SEED, did inwardly come into the Hearts of thoſe that believed in him, and bruiſed the Head of the Serpent, and deſtroyed him that had the Power of Death, that is, the Devil.</q>
And in <hi>Way to the City of God,</hi> p. 125.
<q>Even from the Beginning, yea upon Man's Fall, God was in Chriſt reconciling the World to himſelf, and Chriſt was manifeſt in the HOLY SEED inwardly, and ſtood in the way to ward off the Wrath of God from the Sinners and Unholy, that it might not come upon them to the uttermoſt, during the day of their Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. For even at Man's Fall the Seed of the Woman was given, not only to bruiſe the Serpent's Head, but alſo to be a Lamb or Sacrifice to <hi>attone</hi> and pacifie the Wrath of God towards Men.</q>
And alſo p. 128. he Queries,
<q>Why might not Chriſt ſuffer in Men before his outward Coming, as he doth now ſuffer in them long after it?</q>
Again,
<q>The Seed hath been the SAME in all Ages, and hath had its Sufferings under, by and for the Sins of Men, in them all, for the removing and ABOLISHING of them.</q>
This I bring, not to entertain a ſtrife about words, but ſeeing he abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely told us what he ever intended, I demand the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent hereof, whether he did not then acknowledge Chriſt's Appearance as a Seed, and the Effects thereof, both to reconcile attone and pacifie the Wrath of God towards Men, and alſo to bruiſe the Head of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, was previous to that of his being born of the Bleſſed Virgin, the which he knows to be that which we have all along pinched him with, out of his former

Nor will his Notion of a <hi>diſcontinued diſtance</hi> help him, but rather ſhew he is a meer Shuffler. Firſt, for that it is no Scripture Phraſe,

<q>Chriſt muſt be revealed by the Father, before he became a Foundation, this is that which buildeth, which edifieth the effectual Working in every part, the Revelation of the Arm of the Lord IN Man's Heart.</q>
And p. 103. having told us that
<q>Whatſoever Church is not builded on this Foundation (Chriſt Jeſus immediately revealed both in the whole Body and every Member thereof) is not the true Church, but a Synagogue of Satan, a vile Harlot, <hi>Myſtery Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> the Mother of Fornicators, for the true Church is one in all Ages, and hath ever had one Foundation Jeſus Chriſt, the ſame yeſterday, to day, and for ever.</q>
[Note this muſt relate to his inward Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance only, for he had not taken Fleſh of the Virgin from everlaſting.] He proceeds to Query,
<q>What was this Foundation of the Church of God, before ever Scripture was writ, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>?</q>
[Was not that before his outward Appearance in Fleſh, ſay I?]
<q>Was it not Jeſus Chriſt the Word, which was in the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>?</q>
To which he anſwers,
<q>It was even the Word which came from God himſelf, and taught them immediately.</q>
Again p. 105. to prove that <hi>Moſes</hi> teſtifieth to this Foundation (Chriſt revealed in Man) he quotes <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. v. 11 to 16. which treats of the word nigh in the Mouth and Heart. And p. 107.
<q>The Jews and People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> who lived in <hi>Moſes</hi>'s time, and were SAVED [he ſaith] it was through Faith in this Word, in this Prophet raiſed up IN them, in their Hearts, not AT A DISTANCE, but nigh. And this [he calls] Chriſt in them, the Hope of Glory, the Myſtery hid from Ages and Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:93161:20"/>
but was EVER made manifeſt in the Saints.</q>
                  <q>Again p. 112. he ſhews, that under the Name of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, <hi>Solomon</hi> manifeſtly points at this Principle and Foundation, Jeſus Chriſt the Wiſdom and Power of God:</q>
Then asks p. 116.
<q>Where is this Wiſdom to be found? How are Men bewitched from the true Path, where it appears, and how were we bewitched by them, ſeeking her without us?</q>
And now I leave it to the Reader to judge what <hi>G. K.</hi> meant by ſaying, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt revealed in Man is the Foundation of the true Church,</hi> and whether he hath not falſified his Senſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, rather than he would retract what yet he dares not defend, who hath done it premeditatedly, moſt of theſe Quotations having been more than once laid before him in Print already, and argued upon, to which he gives the Go-by while he obtrudes ſuch an Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of his words formerly, as theſe paſſages do di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly oppugn, and takes no notice of what we have alledged out of them.</p>
               <p>What he next offers out of p. 243 to 247. he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends as a proof that <hi>he did then own the Man Chriſt without us in Heaven, as our Head and Foundation, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of our Faith. Anſw.</hi> He ſpeaks indeed there of the Man Chriſt, who ſuffered in the Fleſh at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> his being the <hi>Spring, out of which all the living Streams flow into our Souls,</hi> p. 245. and that he is <hi>to be prayed to,</hi> p. 247. which none of us deny. But the queſtion being about the <hi>object of Faith,</hi> and this Quotation therefore adduced by him, to prove the Man Chriſt without us in Heaven, is the Object of our Faith (though that is not treated of in the Citation given) I ſhall ſhew what <hi>G.

<q>The hidden Man of the Heart, whom <hi>Paul</hi> witneſſed that he lived in him, this he underſtood of Chriſt as Man, ſaith <hi>G. K.</hi>

Which ſhews he there ſpake of him, as a <hi>Spiritual</hi> Man, but

the Body which the Jews Crucified he p. 245. calls
<q>That <hi>Temple</hi> in which the Fullneſs and Centre of Life did dwell.</q>
And in his <hi>Way caſt up</hi> (a Book not yet retracted) p. 102. he is yet more poſitive, that
<q>It is not the outward Fleſh and Blood that is the Man— but the Soul or inward Man that dwelleth in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Fleſh—ſuch as Chriſt was, even from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning.</q>
So that by this Poſition, when he ſpeaks of the Man Chriſt, he muſt mean not the outward Fleſh and Blood, but the Soul or inward Man, which was from the Beginning, and in time ſuffered in Fleſh, whom <hi>Paul</hi> and the Saints witneſſed in them, as Man, which he ſeemed to foreſee, when he tells us here, <hi>Leſt any ſhould ſurmiſe, that by Chriſt Jeſus in all this large Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I did mean the Light Within only, and not the Man Chriſt Jeſus without us, I expreſly mention the Man Chriſt Jeſus without us,</hi> p. 246. <hi>who is aſcended,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Anſw.</hi> He then ſaid, even in behalf of us, whom he hath ſince tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, as well as himſelf, that
<q>We own Chriſt Jeſus, not only as God, but as Man, and that both inwardly and outwardly. [But] the immediate Fellowſhip and Union with the Man Chriſt Jeſus without us, who is aſcended, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>— We have [ſaith he there] through the meaſure of the Life of Jeſus Chriſt, as Man made manifeſt in us.</q>
Thus he tells us the effect of the Faith wrought, viz. <hi>Immediate <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion of the Man Chriſt without us, who is aſcended,</hi> is by the <hi>inward</hi> Manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Man Chriſt: Then ſurely that Manifeſtation muſt be the <hi>Object of our Faith,</hi> ſay I, <hi>viz.</hi> That which being preſented before us gives the Fellowſhip, gives the Union within as aſcended.</p>
               <p>Yet ſo much Flouriſh doth he make upon this Quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that he angrily ſuggeſts, p. 10. <hi>It is abundantly ſufficient to diſcover the Impudence of his late Adverſaries, who by perverting his words aſſert, That he made the Light the alone Object of Faith, which</hi> (he ſaith) <hi>he never did.

occaſion to demand of him, Whether there be no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty to find, who the Woman is that had ten Souls, kept nine and loſt one; or has the ſame Woman lighted the Candle, ſwept the Houſe, ſought and found one of her Souls in the Houſe, and what that Houſe was, where ſhe found the Soul ſhe had loſt? Surely Abſurdities will grow upon him thick and three-fold (as the Saying is) if we come to examine him throughout. However he endeavours to prove his Aſſertion, That by the loſt piece of Money is meant the Souls of Men, not the Light Within, from the <hi>Womans lighting the Candle to ſeek the loſt piece of money, which plainly ſignifieth</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that the way that the Lord uſeth to find the loſt Soul, is by lighting a Candle in it, and inwardly enlightning it, to ſee its loſt Condition. Anſw.</hi> Firſt, The Lord can find the Soul without lighting a Candle in it, but he lights a Candle in it, that by the Light thereof it may find him, in and through that Gift of his Light, Spirit or Grace, which he had put into it, and which it, by departing therefrom, is ſaid to have left. Which if the Creature had totally loſt, ſo that its day of Viſitation were over, there had been no remaining ſpark in the Soul to ſeek it, nor had it received that degree of renewed Light, whereby to light the Candle, and both ſeek and find the loſt piece. Secondly, The very deſign of the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, was to ſet forth, <hi>not</hi> what God had loſt, <hi>but</hi> what Man had loſt, the Candle being uſed by Man, who needed it, not by God and Chriſt, who needed it not. Man was the loſer, he was to ſweep his own Houſe, in order to find what he had loſt, which was primarily the Divine Gift which God had given him and his Soul (or rather the Life of his Soul) but conſequently of that. And indeed <hi>G. K.</hi> himſelf more nearly hits the Scope of the Parable, in the Explication he here gives of what he had ſaid <hi>Imm. Rev.</hi> p. 125. the which he tells us, <hi>T.

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:93161:23"/>
That God had not loſt himſelf, nor Chriſt had not loſt Chriſt, but men had loſt both by their Sins.</hi> So little doth he mend the matter by his preſent Expoſition of the Parable. Yet to that degree is the Man infatuated, that what moſt deſerved notice, <hi>viz.</hi> His many flat Doctrinal Contradictions, he can glibly ſlide over; this which himſelf ſaid above, was a <hi>miſunderſtanding, an undue application of Scripture,</hi> and yet <hi>to prove a Truth,</hi> comes very frankly from him, as if he longed to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe his Folly and Unſoundneſs, which he had given but too great Demonſtration of before.</p>

Knowledge and Faith. Yet to make it yet more fully appear, hear him further p. 232. where he ſaith,
<q>In them who have not the Scriptures, the Spirit and Light ſufficiently teacheth them the parts of Religion abſolutely neceſſary, without the Scripture, to which parts the Hiſtory of the Scripture doth not belong.</q>
What parts are thoſe, ſay I? For the Spirit doth not teach the Knowledge of Chriſt's Birth, Life, Death, Reſurrection, Aſcenſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> without the Scripture, (omitting Circumſtances of Time, Place, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he could not formerly mean, as he now ſaith, but his ſaying ſo now, is a falſe Pretence. See alſo p. 243. where he ſaith,
<q>True Religion and Chriſtianity may ſubſiſt without the Knowledge of Chriſt in the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to wit, In the Myſtery of the Life of Chriſt in the Spirit, and yet even here, where the Hiſtory is wanting [he doth not ſay the Circumſtance of Time, Place, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] the Myſtery or in-ſide of Chriſtianity is not without its skin or out-ſide, namely an outward Confeſſion unto God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
This I doubt not but he would now account <hi>Deiſm</hi> in us; but I obſerve, he did not then oppoſe Myſtery to Myſtery, but Letter to My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, out-ſide to in-ſide, yea that he admitted of an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, <hi>viz. an outward Confeſſion unto God,</hi> which might ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt without the Knowledge of Chriſt in the Letter (which is more than bare Circumſtances of Time, Place or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons) even where the Hiſtory is wanting: And that in the Myſtery of the Life of Chriſt in the Spirit. So that then true Religion and Chriſtianity (with him) might ſubſiſt in the Myſtery without the Hiſtory: Nor was it the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate between him and his Antagoniſt whether <hi>all the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances</hi> were <hi>Eſſential</hi> to true Religion, but whether the <hi>literal and hiſtorical Knowledge</hi> was ſo, which <hi>G.

However if the Reader be diſpoſed to ſee what I have affirmed out of him, upon this Subject, he may find it in <hi>My People called Quakers cleared,</hi> p. 17, to 22. and <hi>Keith</hi> againſt <hi>Keith,</hi> p. 69, to 71.

But he adds, <hi>upon Suppoſition, that any ſuch thing can be found in my Books, I retract and renounce it,</hi> which is Childiſh all over.

And towards the cloſe of that Page, he ſaith,
<q>Let the Scriptures be ſearched throughout, and it ſhall never be found, that Men are ſimply condemned, or made inexcuſeable for <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin, but for their own Sins in the firſt place, and for thoſe of their Anceſtors but conſequentially <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
This laſt Citation <hi>G.

To which I Anſwer, The new Diſpenſation is a Fruit of Mercy as well as Juſtice, extended to the Vineyard in order to its bringing forth Fruit, his Puniſhment afterwards is an Effect of his Righteouſneſs; but God's not puniſhing Infants, who never ſinned is an Effect of Juſtice, of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs only. Yet that he may put a Trick upon his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, he jumbles theſe two Quotations together, (which ſpake of different things, the firſt, of a new Diſpenſation to Mankind, in order to bring forth Fruit; the ſecond, of Infants not being condemned, who never ſinned) and that in theſe words, <hi>I did give</hi> p. 72. <hi>that none are ſimply condemned and ſent to Hell, for</hi> Adam<hi>'s Sin, for I cannot agree to that uncharitable Opinion, that any dying Infants periſh, or ſuffer the Fire of Hell-fire, ſim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="83" facs="tcp:93161:42"/>
while pretending to give his own words, the Senſe of which he hath notoriouſly perverted, fetching in what was written in the beginning of the Page, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected God's Righteouſneſs in a renewed Viſitation; and expecting of Fruit, and clapping to the end of the ſecond Quotation, which ſpake of the not condemning Infants, who never had ſinned, thoſe words [what God in ſtrict Juſtice might do <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] as if they had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately followed in the Quotation, whereas they preceeded half a Page and more above, and were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to a different end. Which is ſuch a degree of Notorious Prevarication and Falſhood, that is rarely found in the worſt of our Antagoniſts.</p>
               <p>By this time the Reader may give a gueſs what the Man would be at; which till I had thus traced him, was very obſcure to me. For his pretended <hi>diſſatisfaction with the method he had uſed from</hi> p<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 67, to 72. <hi>in the way of managing this Argument</hi> (which he calls) <hi>effectual and ſolid in the main, as to the ſubſtance of it, yet not with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to diverſe weighty Circumſtances in anſwering Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt it</hi> (which is all he gives, ſo much as <hi>leaning</hi> towards a Retractation) could give me no light into it: Who as he ſaith not that his former Arguments were unſound, but that they were effectual and ſolid in the main: So wherein <hi>any Circumſtance</hi> is otherwiſe, he aſſigns not, but by his Legerdemain and Foul Play leaves a more open way for us, to track his Senſe here, than in many of the foregoing; which Courſe is not to his Credit.</p>
               <p>In his Quotation out of p. 69. he is not quite ſo groſs. What he had there ſaid of <hi>a Seed of Sin, its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tranſmuted from</hi> Adam <hi>into all his Poſterity,</hi> he gives at large, with this addition [<hi>I ſtill affirm it</hi>] what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed in that place [that it is not Mens Sin, nor im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted unto them before Actual Tranſgreſſion] he takes no notice of, nor doth he ſo much as O'<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Yet at length, ſpeaking of <hi>Infants,</hi> he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth, <hi>they all need that God be merciful unto them for Chriſt's ſake,</hi> and therein I agree with him, but to different Ends: For I diſtinguiſh between <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>Juſtice</hi>; the not puniſhing Infants who have not ſinned, is a Fruit of his Juſtice, the preſerving them from ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, by his Divine Seed, is a Fruit of his Mercy.

But theſe Tricks will do him no good, but be a means further to detect and expoſe his Fraudulent dealing.</p>

                  </q>
To this Query I will oppoſe another Query of <hi>G. K</hi>'s, as I find it in <hi>Truth Advanced</hi> p. 183. Qu. 4.
<q>Whether <hi>Paul</hi>'s Saying, He thanked God he did Baptize but a few at <hi>Corinth,</hi> doth prove that Water-Baptiſm was of no more Eſteem or Value than Circumciſion, ſeing a Faithful Preacher might ſay concerning a People to whom the Goſpel had been preached—He thanked God he was not ſent to preach to them, but to a People that were more Worthy? Doth this prove that the Preaching of the Goſpel is to be laid aſide? ſaith <hi>G. K.</hi>

For although we read the Angels are ſaid to be <hi>Miniſtring Spirits, ſent forth to miniſter for them who ſhall be Heirs of Salvation,</hi> Heb. 1.14. yet we no where read they were inſtrumental to the Creation (for God created the World not only principally, but even without Inſtruments) nor was the World ſo much as <hi>inſtrumentally</hi> redeemed by the Death of the Martyrs, their Death was not ſo much as contributary thereto, but <hi>ſolely and wholly</hi> by Chriſt the Redemer.

                  <q>The ſubſtance of what he gives out of <hi>Truth Defence</hi> p. 191, 192. is that the Sacrifice of Chriſt's Death did truly extend for the Remiſſion of Sins paſt, from the beginning of the World, that all the Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers that lived under the Law and Prophets, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Law, were ſaved by Faith in Chriſt— and by Vertue of his Death and Offerings, once for all, all have had, have, or ſhall have a Day of Viſitation— and ſhall be accountable to the Man Chriſt, on the ſcore of his Dying for them.</q>
Upon this he deſcants, p. 35. not retracting but defending it, as proving <hi>that he did not place our</hi> WHOLE <hi>Salvation upon an inward Principle, excluding the Man Chriſt Jeſus from being jointly concerned with his Light, Grace and Spirit in Men, as</hi> (he falſly ſaith) <hi>many called</hi> Quakers <hi>do: And that he then held, that all who were ſaved in any Age of the World, were ſaved by Faith in Chriſt, as well before he came in the Fleſh as ſince.</hi> All which is granted him, as I have often told him, but whether that Faith was ALWAYS at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with a Revelation that he came and ſuffered outwardly, elſe NOT SAVING, is the Matter in Controverſie. For whereas ſome had objected, <hi>There can be no Juſtification without Faith in Chriſt, but theſe</hi> Gentiles <hi>had not Faith in Chriſt, G. K.</hi> anſwers <hi>by deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſecond Propoſition, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni. Gr.</hi> p. 30. that they had not Faith in Chriſt. And how did he prove that, may ſome ſay? Did he offer to prove that they had an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit Faith in Chriſt (his late diſtinction) or that they might have the Hiſtory of what Chriſt did and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, or was to do and ſuffer, without Circumſtances
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:93161:58"/>
of Times, Places or Perſons (a new-coined fetch he hath in Sect. I. §. 18. of theſe) nothing leſs.
<q>But as he had ſaid <hi>Imm. Rev.</hi> p. 243. that true Religion and Chriſtianity may ſubſiſt without the Hiſtory of Chriſt in the Letter, to wit in the Myſtery of the Life of Chriſt in the Spirit, and yet, even here, where the Hiſtory is wanting, the Myſtery or Inſide of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity is not without its Skin or Outſide, namely an outward Confeſſion to God <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
So here <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni. Gr.</hi> p. 30. he ſaith,
<q>If they did cleave unto and believe in the Light, they believed in Chriſt, for he is the Light, nor is the outward Name that which ſaveth, but the inward Nature Vertue and Power ſignified thereby, which was made manifeſt in them <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
So that Faith in the <hi>inward Manifeſtation</hi> was Faith in <hi>Chriſt</hi> then with <hi>G. K.</hi> and alſo Saving.
<q>This he calls <hi>ibid,</hi> p. 34. the main and principal Thing, the Word of Faith, the <hi>Gentiles</hi> did ſhare in with the <hi>Jews,</hi> that whoever a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Gentiles</hi> did believe and call upon the Name of the Lord, were ſaved, no leſs than the <hi>Jews.</hi>
                  </q>
And <hi>ibid</hi> p. 56. he calls it,
<q>Some Manifeſtation of him, in and among the <hi>Gentiles, ſufficient to Salvation.</hi> As well as that he had ſaid, <hi>ibid</hi> p. 36. The very Goſpel hath been preached to ALL, otherwiſe they ſhould never have been charged with not having obeyed it.</q>
All which I offer that <hi>G. K.</hi> may not couch himſelf under general tearms, and thereby caſt a Miſt before his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der's Eyes, as he endeavours to do in what follows, where he ſaith</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That by Faith in Chriſt, I meant the Man Chriſt (who is both God and Man) who in the fulneſs of time came in the Fleſh, and ſhed his Blood, for the Remiſſion of their Sins, is obvious to any Intelligent Reader. Anſw.</hi> Then it ſeems he was the Man Chriſt <hi>before</hi> that fulneſs of time, that he came in the Fleſh and ſuffered, <hi>viz.</hi> that which he calleth <hi>Way to City of God,</hi> p. 133.
<q>That Heavenly and

Divine Subſtance or Eſſence of which the Divine Birth was both Conceived in <hi>Mary,</hi> and is inwardly Conceived in the Saints <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As ſuch he calls him the Seed of the Woman that even at Man's Fall was given to bruiſe the Serpents Head, and to be a Lamb or Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to attone and pacifie the Wrath of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Men, and that he bore the weight of his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Sufferings, in great meaſure, from the very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning.</q>
See <hi>ibid</hi> p. 125, 126. Now the Matter in Debate between <hi>G. K.</hi> and us, even with reſpect to what he hath formerly aſſerted, is whether this Attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, this Sacrifice, this bearing the weight of his Sufferings from the beginning, did bruiſe the Head of the Serpent in none, attone for none, ſave none, either before Chriſt's Offering up of himſelf in the outward, or where a Revelation from God, that he ſhould ſo ſuffer, was not given? That without his outward Coming, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Decree of God, Redemption had never been Purchaſed, ſo that whoever are ſaved in any Age of the World, it is by Vertue thereof, is fully and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily acknowledged by us: But whether this Vertue hath never ſaved any, but where the Hiſtory (I do not ſay, the Circumſtances of Times, Places <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry) hath been revealed, is that wherein we oppoſe <hi>G. K.</hi> formerly to <hi>G. K.</hi> latterly. Therefore what he adds, <hi>That we are moſt injurious to him, and falſe Accuſers of him, who call this a new Doctrine, to affirm that all whoever were ſaved with Eternal Salvation, were ſaved by Faith in the Man Chriſt, either expreſs or implicit, even by him that was in the fulneſs of time Crucified for them,</hi> is an unfair ſtating of the Controverſie. For beſides that contrary to his own Rule (<hi>Ex.

I had in my <hi>Keith</hi> againſt <hi>Keith,</hi> p. 107, 108. quoting him out of <hi>Preſb. and Ind.

(which Book I know not how to come by) <hi>That all that go to Chriſt in Heaven after Death, muſt have an expreſs Knowledge of Chriſt in Heaven.</hi> Whence he Queries, both whether the <hi>Souls now in Heaven, can be without all Knowledge of Chriſt, and whether the Souls of</hi> Plato, <hi>and</hi> Socrates (<hi>whom farr be it from him,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>to ſuppoſe they are not in Heaven) are ſtill without all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Knowledge of Chriſt? Anſw.</hi> If the Faith the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles have, will carry them to Chriſt in Heaven, they are well enough. We doubt not but their Knowledge <hi>there</hi> will be compleat; nor do we think when they are once there, they will be ſent back again for want of an expreſs Knowledge, before they came thither.

He then ſaid,
<q>Now the Light hath ſhined forth in ſuch clearneſs, that we [<hi>i. e.</hi> as now interpreted, <hi>ſome</hi> of us] have ſeen to the bottom of all <hi>Babylon</hi>'s Treaſures. And we [to wit, ſome of the People called Quakers] do witneſs this day come and broke up among us in pure perfect Brightneſs, every one in their meaſure, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And we [<hi>viz.</hi> Not the Generality, but ſome of us] have ſeen the Bride, the Lamb's Wife, the <hi>New Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> deſcending from above, from God out of Heaven—And her Light is like unto a Stone moſt precious, like a Jaſper clear as Chryſtal, and we [ſome of us] have ſeen the Frame and Proportion of this City, with the Walls and Gates of it, (within which our [<hi>i. e.</hi> ſome of our] feet have ſtood)—And the Lord hath made us [ſome of us] Citizens of this City, and Stones of this Building—And as the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry

and Worſhip of the Church or Houſe of God among us, [<hi>viz.</hi> among ſome of us] is Spiritual, ſo is the Order, Diſcipline and Government among us, [<hi>i. e.</hi> ſome of us] And now what I have declared un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you (and the Manifeſtation of the Spirit of Truth will ſhew much more, even the perfect Pattern of the Houſe of God in the Mount) concerning theſe things, which are neceſſary and expedient in order to a through, cleanly and perfect Reformation, we [<hi>i. e.</hi> ſome of us] the People of the Lord, called Quakers have fallen upon them, being taught and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by the Wiſdom of God.</q>
Thus far out of <hi>G. K.</hi> in which what I have inſerted in Crotchets, ſhews the natural Tendency of this preſent Retractation. If this diſpleaſe ſuch among the Church of <hi>England-men</hi> and Proteſtant Diſſenters he now would fawn upon, as too large a Character of any of us, perhaps for their ſakes, in his next, he may retract it yet further. That he did not do it now, I do not ſo much impute to any remaining Eſteem of any of us, as that the Man is loth to be thought wavering in his Judgment, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it would go eaſieſt off, to make it general, which he may hereafter reſtrict as narrow as he pleaſeth. Yet let me add, The Quakers (neither in the General nor in the Particular) do not any more need his Teſtimony for them, who is gone from that which gave it, than <hi>Paul</hi> did that of the <hi>Pythones</hi> Damſel, who ſaid, <hi>Theſe, Men are the Servants of the moſt high God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Acts</hi> 16. v. 16, 17.

Anſw.</hi> I preſume it was not long ſince he thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a <hi>Chief Leader</hi> among them, more fit to lead than to be lead.
