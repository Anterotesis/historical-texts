            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE <hi>Fourth Doctrin</hi> is, That, although Chriſt ſeems ſometimes to be far di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant from his People under their <hi>Trials,</hi> yet he doth notice them in a ſingular way. He ſaw them <hi>toiling</hi> and <hi>rowing</hi> (as <hi>Mark</hi> has it) and yet he was at <hi>Prayer</hi> all the time. For clearing you, we ſhall (1.) ſhew what way Chriſt <hi>noticeth</hi> the <hi>Trials</hi> of his people. (2.) Why he doth ſo. (3.) What his noticeing doth to his People in their Trials
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:136247:3"/>
(4.) What are the Trials, wherein he doth concern him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
               <p>In order to the Firſt, He noticeth the Trials of his People, as he hath <hi>fore-ordained</hi> them in his eternal Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel. Nothing ever befell his People but what was decreed from Everlaſting. 2. He ſo noticeth the Trials of his People, in making them fall out for ſeveral caſes, and keeping his eye upon them therein. 3. He hath not only a <hi>permiſſive</hi> but an <hi>active</hi> hand in ſeting all the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their Trials on foot, whether they be Devils, or Men, or wind, or ſtorm: he ſiſteth the houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> with a ſieve, yet not one grain ſhall be loſt. By his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence he triſtes a convenient ſeaſon for the trial, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times (as he did to <hi>Peter</hi>) gives them warning of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Trial come, —<hi>thus night before the cock crow, thou ſhalt deny me thrice.</hi> 4. He ſo noticeth the trials of his People, as to ſet bounds to them, that they come ſuch and ſuch a length, and no further; as here in the Text, he lets the Diſciples toil-on till the <hi>fourth watch of the night.</hi> 5. He noticeth their Trials ſo as he maketh interceſſion to God for them anent their trials: as here he was at prayer when they were toiling and rowing in the night-time <hi>in the midſt of the Sea.</hi> 6. He ſo noticeth their trials, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he drives-on his own purpoſes, and makes their trials ſubſervient thereunto.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Second</hi> thing is, <hi>Why he noticeth the Trials of his People. Anſw.</hi> 1. Becauſe he is highly concerned in them: they ſtand in a near relation to him: they are all the fruit of the travel of his Soul: he is engaged to the Father for them, and them therein; and all that befalleth them is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto him, and He is to be anſwerable for the leaſt of them. 2. There are few, or none, but he is to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of their Trials; for they can do little themſelves, and others deſpiſe them. 3. His noticeing of his Peoples trial ſayes they were not caſt under them by hap-hazard, but with deliberation, and that they are not alone in their trials, although they often-times perceive him not, yea even when they are as <hi>beaſts, Pſalm.</hi> 73.—<hi>Nevertheleſs I am continually with thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:136247:3"/>The <hi>Third</hi> thing in the <hi>Doctrin</hi> is, <hi>What his People have by his notice.</hi> It ſayes, his Peoples trials cannot runn a full car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier, as otherwiſe they might: he ſets bounds to them, and has allowed the expences wherewith to debate with them.</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>Fourth</hi> thing <hi>What are the Trials wherein he doth moſt concern himſelf.</hi> 1. He noticeth indeed his Peoples trials, but eſpecially thoſe which their duty has led them to, as here he had commanded them to go to Sea. 2. He noticeth all ſuch trials as are above their reach, as to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate; as here in the text. 3. He noticeth all the trials wherein his People are labouring as much as they are able, though all their labour ſignifie not much. 4. He noticeth all the trials that are hard, and far above the trials they have formerly met with, as here in the text.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe</hi> 1. Then let the People of God comfort themſelves with this, that he taketh notice of al their trials in all the fore-mentioned reſpects, and is much concerned to do ſo. Then ſince it is ſo, men ſhall not get all the intents of their heart againſt his People, but they ſhall have ſupport under all their trials, and relief from them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe</hi> 2. The trials of his People in <hi>Brittain</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> are certainly concerned by him: For <hi>Firſt,</hi> He did engage them in the buſineſs, and it is above remedy as to men. 2. It is above all other trials that ever we were under be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and all his People are toiling as they can under them. We may add this as a <hi>third,</hi> That they are triſted with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny notorious indignitys don to the King of Heaven. 4. His Name is ſingularly concerned in the thing. All Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are looking whether or not our matters will ſtand; for they have heard that we were a <hi>Covenanted People</hi> with the God of heaven. 5. He conſiders he has a goodly Remnant and Flock in the Veſſel that is now <hi>toſſed</hi> with the ſtorm. If his People would reſolve to drown together rather than to ſin by compliance, it would ſpeak much good of the buſineſs. But Chriſt's <hi>advocation</hi> is on foot for his People who are engaged for him: he was at prayer when his Diſciples were at Sea: he prayed that <hi>Peters faith might not fail.</hi> Now his <hi>Advocation</hi> is in order to theſe
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:136247:4"/>
things: <hi>Firſt,</hi> That his Peoples faith fail not, as has been ſaid. 2. That the ſin, which hath brought-on the trial, may be forgiven them, and all the circumſtances of their trial. 3. That they may not take any unlawfull way for their outgate. 4. That their trial may be ſanctified ſo as to produce its proper fruit with them that are under it. 3. That their want of a right and ſuteable frame of ſpirit may not increaſe their trials, or ſtop their out-gate and iſſue, and that it may according to the promiſe be haſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as it is in <hi>Zech.</hi> The <hi>Man</hi> whom he ſaw <hi>among the mirtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Trees,</hi> that were <hi>in the bottom,</hi> was <hi>CHRIST</hi> interpoſing for the poor <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> O for the faith of this, that he is interpoſing himſelf for all our trials!</p>
               <p>Then I ſay 1. Study all of you to be of one mind. 2. Let his People comply with him in all the points or his Advocation we have ſpoken of, and keep up the Cauſe of his concernments, acknowledging always your ſin and ſhort-coming, and <hi>chooſe</hi> evermore <hi>affliction</hi> rather than ſin, and ſtudy to have the right uſe of the trial as much as the out-gate. 3. Let this comfort and eſtabliſh your hearts, that Chriſt is pleading and advocating your cauſe before God and his Throne in all the fore-ſaid reſpects, and remember that God heareth him alwayes, and that he will not lye unto <hi>David,</hi> but will <hi>keep Covenant</hi> with him, even when his Children tranſgreſs, and that <hi>is a good thing,</hi> Sirs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 80.</p>
               <p>Now from their toiling and rowing obſerve, That his People muſt be in the uſe of any mean God has left them, although the uſe thereof ſignifie very little for their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate. They wrought here againſt wind and weather, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though to little purpoſe. The Diſciples brought the four or five <hi>loaves</hi> to Chriſt, although it ſeemed to them a vain thing to feed ſo many. For amplification, we would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member theſe things: 1. That in the worſt of times God has left ſome means for his People to uſe. 2. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that the Lord by theſe ſilly means ſometimes works great things, ſo that his People ſhould not be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together hopeleſs in the uſe of them. 3. We would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:136247:4"/>
that the Lord one way or other bleſſeth the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent uſe of ordinary means, how ſmall ſo-ever they be. 4. When God hath left no ordinary means proper for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing ſuch and ſuch effects, he has appointed his People to pray, and ſtand ſtill and look for his ſalvation. When <hi>Iſrael</hi> is brought to the red Sea, and the AEgyptians purſuing them, and no mean left, <hi>Moſes</hi> cries unto the Lord, and bids the People ſtand ſtill, and ſee the ſalvation of the Lord. 5. Remember that it is ordinary for God to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce his People to very ſmall means in their ſtraits, and yet they are commanded to uſe them; and by this he tries their loyalty and obedience, and this alſo teacheth them not to idolize the beſt of means. Then let his People in all their ſtraits look what means God hath allowed them to make uſe of, and be diligent in the uſe of them. 2. They would not deſpond, when the means appear very deſpiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, for God uſes to bleſs the lawfull uſe of ſmall means. 3. When no proper mean is left, then be in the uſe of Prayer, for that is your duty, and that may breed peace. Let God do what is good in his ſight.</p>
               <p>Now we come to the <hi>Third</hi> thing, and that is <hi>the out-gate of the Diſciples, and all the circumſtances of it</hi>: when they began to drown, they were but four miles from land, and not till then, <hi>And in the fourth watch of the night,</hi> and that is near the morning. Then Love ſets forward, and Chriſt comes without their entreaty, and worketh by his Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency upon the waters, which he made like a beaten floor under his feet: then, when he comes, they miſtake him, and are afraid; and ſo their trial groweth to a greater height: he ſpeaks to them, and inhibits their fear, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layes it, by telling them that it was <hi>he.</hi> And ſo in this their new trial they got a new diſcovery of him, and then he comes to the ſhip. And next ye have <hi>Peters</hi> ſeeking a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular evidence of this, if it was Chriſt that ſpake, to them.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>obſerve</hi> this Doctrin: Sometimes when we think our trial great enough, Chriſt is pleaſed to ſcrue it up a great deal higher. They ſurely judged their trial at a great
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:136247:5"/>
height before, with wind and ſtorm: we may think it was at a great height before <hi>the fourth watch of the night,</hi> and yet he is pleaſed to drive it that length.</p>
               <p>For clearing of the Doctrin, <hi>Conſider</hi> that his People ſoon thinks their trial at a great height: <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe they meaſur it by former ſufferings they have met with, or by former trials, not remembring that the Lord intends to have his People further tried, and that the latter triall wil be ſharper, and poſſibly darker, as to the out-gate, than the firſt was. 2. They compare their trials and meaſur them with the trials of his People, that have not been with the higheſt, but with the loweſt; and that makes them think their trial high enough. 3. They often meaſur their trials with their preſent felt ſtrength, not remembring that he gives out expence according as the trial groweth. 4. They often compare their trials with the means that are left them for out-gate, not remembring that God uſeth ſometimes to lay-aſide all means that People have their eyes on, and create new means for their out-gate and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance. 5. They often meaſur their trials by their own fore-caſting one reſolution for it, whereas the trials ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſwell to a greater height than his People apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it to go: and becauſe the trial ſoon goes to ſuch a height, we think it will go no further, and ſo we err, not knowing the Power and Counſel of the Lord.</p>

                  </gap> Ye would <hi>conſider</hi> that the Lord has different ends in the trials of his People, which they know not, and different thoughts. 2. He is Maſter of their trials, when it is above their reach, for he intends to magnifie his <hi>Power in their weakneſe,</hi> and to give them ſingular proofs of his Love towards them, which his People were not expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and to drive them to ſuch things as are not ſoon ſet on foot with them. 3. As this makes him wind-up their trials to an higher pitch, ſo we would beware of ſome miſtakes that are about his way in this: <hi>Firſt,</hi> We muſt not think that this is for want of love to the Party tried. Or 2. that he forgets them, as they are apt to fancy: for here he ſaw them <hi>toiling</hi> and <hi>rowing,</hi> and yet he was <hi>praying</hi> for
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:136247:5"/>
them, as has been ſaid. 3. We would not think it undu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifulneſs in the Party tried, for here the Diſciples were toiling and rowing as they could. 4. We would not think but leſs trials would be ſufficient to lay us on our back, if we were left to our ſelves, and had no ſupply from him. Then learn 1. to judge of your trials aright, and to meaſure rightly: for that will prevent many unſuteable complaints and deſpondency of ſpirit. 2. When ye think your trials at a great height, and at the higheſt pitch you can bear or be recovered from, to your apprehenſion, leave room to him to wind them up a pin higher, and miſtake him not, though he do ſo.</p>
               <p>The next Doctrin is, That though the deliverance of his People may be delayed, yet it ſets foreward in due time, Chriſt at length comes; and there is great reaſon for his delays many times, as was ſhewed before: and here we ſhall ſpeak 1. How it may be ſaid he comes in due time, though he delay. 2. What way he comes, ſo as it may be ſaid he comes in due time. And <hi>firſt,</hi> He comes in due time, when he comes ſeaſonably to prevent the ruine of his People, as <hi>Pſ.</hi> 94: 10.18. <hi>When I ſaid, my foot ſlippeth: thy mercy, O Lord, held me up.</hi> 2. He cometh ſeaſonably, when he doth triſt with their fit condition: for as ſoon as they are deſperat of help any other way, and begin to look to God alone, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 142:4. <hi>I looked on my right hund, and beheld, but</hi> there was <hi>no man that would know me; refuge fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me: no man cared for my ſoul. I cried unto thee, O Lord, I ſaid, Thou</hi> art <hi>my refuge,</hi> and <hi>my portion in the land of the living.</hi> Then 3. It cometh ſeaſonably, as it's meaſured out, to prevent any ſinfull courſe for out-gate, which his People are ready to ſplit upon in the time of trial, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 125. 3. <hi>For the rod of the wicked ſhall not reſt upon the lot of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous: leſt the righteous put forth their hands unto iniquity.</hi> 4. It cometh ſeaſonably, as the deliverance cometh forth, when it is ſweeteſt to the Party tried. O! how cheerfull were they, when he came unto them? and how affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natly did they receive him into the ſhip?</p>
               <p>The next thing we ſhall obſerve, ſhall be the things
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:136247:6"/>
which appeared in their deliverance, 1. When he comes, they were toiling in the uſe of the means they had, though it did ſignifie little for the time. 2. He comes without much entreaty on their part: all this time we hear not much of their Prayers. 3. The delivery comes as a fruit of Chriſt's interceſſion: He had been praying, and now as the fruit of his interceſſion he is ſent himſelf as the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverer of the party that could do little for themſelves, but were all dead men in their own eſtimation. 4. The deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance cometh paving-out the way to its ſelf through dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties, which nothing but free love and Omnipotency, and almighty power could or would have done. No dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty ſtands before him, when his Peopls caſe ſo requires: he puts forth omnipotency for a refuge to his People that he has engaged with hazards. 5. The deliverance ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth in Chriſt's dominion over that which did trouble his People: now he cometh trampling upon the Sea which was ready to ſwallow them up: he proveth himſelf to be Lord over that which did affright them, although they were not as yet delivered from it. 6. Their deliverance cometh with new proofs and diſcoveries of Chriſt's love to the party, and of his ſoveraignty over that which was their fear, and ſets them free from all that which made them afraid. Then for</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe,</hi> Let his People take courage to them, and ſet their face to the ſtorm, for their deliverance will come in good opportunity and ſeaſon, in all the foreſaid reſpects.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe</hi> 2. Let his People make uſe of any means that he has left them, and all of them pray and wreſtle with him alittle while yet.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe</hi> 3. We muſt look for more out of his compaſſion and pity, and as the fruit of Chriſt's interceſſion, than from all our own devotion and diligence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe</hi> 4. Although difficulties be unſupportable, as to us, yet we are to wait for ſingular caſts of his Power, if the caſe ſo require.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe</hi> 5. Let his People wait for diſcoveries of him, for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

not be the leaſt diſcovery of him: yet he ſhall appear trampling upon thoſe that keep us captive, by his omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Power, when he thus appears, then lift up the head for deliverance cometh near. And whether I be dead, or alive, I charge all the godly to act faith in him, when he is ſeting his foot on our Sea, when he ſhall begin to out-will his Enemies, and divide them among themſelves, and break their purpoſes among their hands, and to intricat them with their own work, and confound their purpoſes, and to execute vengeance here and there upon them. There ye may conclude he is beginning to ſet his foot upon our Sea, and ye are to look for deliverance to his Church!</p>

               </head>
               <p>WE were ſpeaking of the out-gate of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples from a ſad trial, and that their delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance did not appear, untill the <hi>fourth watch of the night.</hi> He is pleaſed to wind-up the trials of his People higher than they thought they would ever have born-out, but though he delayed a long time, yet now he ſets foreward, and comes to them. I told you that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance of his People doth come in due time: Now when Chriſt ſets foreward, they apprehend him to be ſome <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> or <hi>Devil.</hi> So it holds-out this Doctrin</p>
               <p n="1">1. That many times when the Lord ſets foreward to the deliverance of his People, they do exceedingly miſtake him, as is eminently clear in the text, and as it was in the caſe of his People, when <hi>Moſes</hi> brought them out of <hi>Aegypt.</hi> And here I ſhall ſhew you, in what caſes his People miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take him, when he ſets foreward to deliver them. 2. What cauſeth them miſtake. <hi>Firſt,</hi> They miſtake him, when they are under great affliction of ſpirit, and ſore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:136247:7"/>
beaten with trials, then they are ready to miſtake him; and in that caſe they are unfit judges of God's appearance, or what he doth or ſaith for their help and good: they are under ſuch a frame of ſpirit, as to expound all he doth or ſaith, to be wrath. When <hi>Iſrael</hi> was in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> they were ſo ſorely beaten with affliction, that they would not give an anſwer or an ear to what <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid unto them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the anguiſh of ſpirit they were under, they had been ſo injured with affliction for a long time. And when a ſoul hath been ſorely beaten with the evidences of his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger a long time, and the terrors of hell hath compaſſed them about, ye will not readily perſwade them of any thing that is for their good; they are not fit judges. 2. They miſtake him, when they are under deep apprehenſions of their own guilt, for then they meaſure every thing by their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving, and ſpeak as <hi>Peter</hi> did, <hi>Depart from me, for I am a ſinfull man:</hi> ye will ſay it's a good word, but it doth not belong to me.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They readily miſtake him, when he moves in their deliverance in ſome ſtrange and unbeaten path; and ſo is it here, for Chriſt came to them walking on the Sea, which was an uncouth way. Think ye but <hi>Jonah</hi> doubted his delivery, when he was ſwallowed-up by the whale? It is natural for all men to miſtake the God of heaven, for <hi>his wayes are not like our wayes</hi>; for men ſavour of the things of the earth, they take up every thing in a natural way: ſo that, except they be helped by God, they cannot take up any thing aright that he doth, there is ſuch a natural incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in them to expound all things wrong. So it is no ſtrange thing that people do not take him up. The truth is, it is a more ſtrange thing that they take him up in any thing right, becauſe of the benſil of their natural ſpirits. 2. We have a miſerable way of ſhaping God by the creatur, and all his wayes like the creaturs wayes: the Diſciples think it can not be a man who walks upon the water, it is ſome <hi>phantaſma</hi> or <hi>Devil.</hi> He was a wiſe man, who ſaid <hi>Is this the manner of men? Indeed not,</hi> David, <hi>there is not a man in all the world that would have taken you from the ſheep-keeping, and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:136247:7"/>
made you a King.</hi> And if that principle were out of the hearts of the People of God, they might come to much ſweetneſs; no doubt that is the thing that alwayes ſpeaks within them <hi>there is no man that would do this with me.</hi> Indeed that is true, but yet it is the way of God for all that: and ye muſt conceive <hi>his wayes are far above mens wayes, as the heavens are above the earth.</hi> The <hi>Third</hi> thing wherein we miſtake, is, We are ready to lay down a way for him to come, and if he come not that way, then we miſtake him. This was the great part of the miſtake in Chriſt's Diſciples at the reſurrection, they thought he ſhould have riſen ſo glorious, that all the world ſhould have fallen-down before him preſently: <hi>And now,</hi> ſay they, <hi>he is three dayes dead,</hi> and they had not ſeen him. Yes they ſaw him, but they thought they would have ſeen him another way, and ſo they miſtook him, they look ſometimes for him in ſuch a mercy, and he comes in another way than they look for him; they look ſometimes for him in a temporal mercy, and he comes in a ſpiritual mercy, in looſing the bonds of the ſpirits of his People, they think he will come in ſuch a mean, and he comes in another that is as good. For <hi>Uſe</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then leave latitude for him to deliver his People from their bondage ſpiritual or temporal, any way he will, and do not confine him to this or that mean: for ordinarily he comes not that way that his People would have him to come, as has often been made out in the experience of his People; ſo that they have been ſometimes afraid to ſpeak of the way they would fain have had him to come, leſt he ſhould have come another.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Put a favourable conſtruction on every thing he doth, and that will prevent your miſtakes of him and his way of coming for the deliverance, whatever it be. His People would enure themſelves to this way, which indeed is much our duty, for <hi>charity thinks not evil,</hi> and it is want of love to God that makes us think evil of his Diſpenſations. God loves a cheerfull giver, and not a churle: he loves alwayes the man that bodes wel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe</hi> 3. When your trials are at a great height, and the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:136247:8"/>
Lord is taking ſtrange wayes and caſts of Providence, be ſparing to ſpeak your judgement and apprehenſion, till you ſee what the reſult will be: for the diſpenſation may look ragged-like at firſt, yet will produce a great mercy to the Church.</p>
               <p>The next <hi>Doctrin</hi> is: Sometimes when God is ſeting the deliverance of his People on foot, he uſeth then to ſcrue up the trials a degree higher than they were before. The Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples were afraid of the Sea before, but now for an evil ſpirit: it's ſaid <hi>they cried-out for fear,</hi> which they did not before, and yet he is coming for their deliverance: there is nothing more true in the many deliverances God wrought for his People in Scriptur than this. Ye may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member <hi>Moſes</hi> is ſent to <hi>Aegypt</hi> to deliver the People, but indeed their trials grew never great, till <hi>Moſes</hi> came; and when they got out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> they are not far off, till the Enemy and the Sea, and the mountains were on every ſide of them, and yet their deliverance was on foot really.</p>
               <p>There are theſe <hi>Reaſons</hi> of the Doctrin: <hi>Firſt,</hi> that he may decry all means, and bring them down in the Peoples conceit, that he has called them to ſet on foot, and that their eyes may be only ſet on God. <hi>Moſes</hi> would have been a great man, and likely idolized by the People, if his enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize had not firſt broke in his hand: if <hi>Iſrael</hi> had not been firſt broken before <hi>Benjamin,</hi> they would have idolized their number of men; but God gave them on their finger-ends once or twice, that they might not lean to their mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude. 2. He doth ſo, that he may prepare his People for the deliverance, though ſuch be his pity and compaſſion, that he waits not for his Peoples frame to deliver them. Ye will ſay, the People is not fit to be delivered. Yes, it is true: but God will do as much in the delivery ſome one way or other, as will fit them more than ſeven years trouble would have don. A little trial in the deliverance it ſelf will do much good, it haſtens the delivery before it come: it may be there will be ſomething in the delivery that will break your heart and humble you more than all the trouble of conſcience or eſtate ye have met with before.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:136247:8"/>3. He doth ſo many times, to make the adverſaries cruel and inſolent, and quickly to fill up their cup. When the trial is betwixt his People and their Enemies, he makes the delivery to take an halt, of purpoſe to make the enemy inſolent and proud, and then to turn up their heels in the midſt of their pride. Wherefore did <hi>Iſraels</hi> delivery halt in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> but that the Enemy might grow more terrible and inſolent? 4. He doth ſo, to make the delivery more ſweet to his People than ever it could have been, if they had not met with that trial. O! but Chriſt was welcome to the Diſciples now! and this new trial made him a great deal more welcome than he would have been? that they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended him to be a <hi>Spirit.</hi> 5. He doth ſo, that there may be fit wither-weights upon his People in their delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, that they may carry ſoberly, and evenly under their recept; for if his People want ſome wither-weight, they are ſo light-headed, that the delivery would make them ſtark mad: therefore he will let ſome worthy inſtrument fall in the delivery of his People, that the loſs of them will almoſt counter-ballance the deliverance. Then 6. He doth ſo, to perfect ſome buſineſs, to debate with ſome perſons, who are exceedingly concerned in the difficulty, that falls on his People; and he avengeth the Particular that he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues in that caſe: and many ſuch things are with him, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I grant the compariſon holds not in all, in that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance that <hi>David</hi> met with from his ſon <hi>Abſalom</hi> and his men, he overturned <hi>Abſalom's</hi> heels, which in <hi>David's</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count did countervail the deliverance it ſelf. Wel then, <hi>Sirs,</hi> ſeing this is God's way to make the deliverance halt, and to ſcrue up the trial a pinn higher ſometimes.</p>
               <p>Then for <hi>Uſe,</hi> If it pleaſe the Lord to let you ſee your deliverance dawning like day upon the mountains, then think that your difficultys are not all over. I will not ſay what way God may take to deliver us, but I am very appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive that whenever the deliverance ſhall come, there ſhall be multituds of difficultys interwoven, that it ſhall be hard to diſcern it, whether it be a deliverance or not, it will look ſo like the contrary. And this I have thought
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:136247:9"/>
many times, What if there ſhould a Party appear for the work of God in the fields, and be broken all to pieces, and yet that ſame Partys breaking contribute for the delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the Church? So I ſay, when the deliverance firſt begins to dawn, do not think that your difficultys are over, ye may meet with ſome thing in the delivery that may be worſe than all the trouble ye have ſeen, that ye will wiſh rather to be as ye were before than to abide it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe</hi> 2. I would not have the People of God to think that their deliverance waits upon their frame of ſpirit for it: I ſay, there may be ſomething in the deliverance that will give you a frame of ſpirit; if the Lord give you a frame of ſpirit before the deliverance come, it is wel; but I am ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry apprehenſive there ſhall be ſomething that will humble his People in <hi>Brittain</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> more than ever ye have yet met with theſe years by-gon. God may do that in a night that will put them more to their prayers than all they have met with before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Uſe</hi> 3. I would have you to think that the deliverance will not come, till all the means be laid aſide. Now ye may be miſtaken in that: But for the inſtrument ye are afraid to idolize, fear not that, for in the deliverance God ſhall make you quite of theſe, which ſhall accreſe to your trial. Or, <hi>Sirs,</hi> is there any of you that have the faith of an out-gate of the People of God in theſe Lands, then I ſay, make your account and prepare your hearts to meet with greater trials than ye have met with formerly, and that even in the dawning of your deliverance. The Diſciples were affrighted even almoſt out of their wits, when they ſaw Chriſt come walking upon the water: now he comes to them, and he had ſome little thing to do with <hi>Peter,</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were fully delivered, he behoved to have a proof of the ſtrength of his own faith and Chriſt's <hi>ſufficiency</hi> to help.</p>
               <p>The next <hi>Doctrin</hi> is this: That the People of God are very ſubject to ſlaviſh fear, when new difficultys appear to them. It's ſaid, when <hi>Iſrael</hi> fled before the men of <hi>Ai, their hearts melted, and became like water.</hi> O! but they were
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:136247:9"/>
afraid! I grant the People of God take ſooner with their ſin than any other People. I ſhall ſpeak <hi>Firſt</hi> what this ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh fear is. 2. Why his People are ſo ſubject to it. 3. What is the prejudice they have by it. 4. What may be the cure of it.</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>Firſt</hi> then, <hi>What this ſlaviſh fear is that his People are troubled with.</hi> It ariſes from the misbelief of what God hath ſaid, and forgeting what he has ſaid concerning them. 2. It flowes from their fixing on his Providence, and puts the worſt conſtruction on it. 3. It flowes from deſpondency of ſpirit and heartleſneſs, and that weakens their hands in the uſe of lawfull means for bearing their own trial and working for their own out-gate; they think they will do no more good than dip their ſinger in water, and their faith and hope and all goes to wrack: and upon this there followes an inclination to follow ſome unlawfull mean for their out-gate, and if they follow not that, then the heart is kindly laid out for ſuch a temptation; for ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily complaints are the fruits of ſlaviſh fear. <hi>Slaviſh fear</hi> then ſtands in this, <hi>viz.</hi> in an atheiſtical puting of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur in a channel of independency on God, as if the creatur could come and go of its own accord without commiſſion from him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5. <hi>It's God who comforteth: who art thou that art afraid of a man that ſhall dye, &amp;c.?</hi> The truth is, they had forgotten the Omnipotent Power and Soveraignty of God, and thought men could do with them what they pleaſed without God. When ye are ſo, it is an hundred to one if ye make not haſt to get from under the trial ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull way.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Reaſons</hi> of this: <hi>Firſt,</hi> There is the great ignorance of God's intereſt in his People, that is the cauſe of all their ſlaviſh <hi>fear,</hi> &amp; that which he challenges his People for, <hi>Thou haſt feared every day, and haſt forgotten me: who art thou that art afraid of a man that ſhall dye?</hi> We take up our ſelves as ſtanding alone without God. There feared they, where no fear was: for <hi>God is in the congregation of the righteous</hi>: ſome take it that it's the Enemy, becauſe of God's being among his People. Yea but ſome take it alſo, that his People fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:136247:10"/>
although God was among them. 2. There is unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief. 3. Atheiſme, a growing ſin; his people apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God to be like the creatur, and the creatur to be like God, that he can work what he will without the creatur, and the creatur what it will without him: he puts God above the creatur in ſomethings, and the creatur above him in ſome other things.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Fourth Reaſon</hi> is, becauſe his People too ſoon yeeld to this fear: ye think in no caſe ye do it without reaſon. Yea but ye are bound to ſhut-out thoſe things, when they come-in upon you. When ſlaviſh fear begins to mutter in our boſom for harbouring, it makes it prevail.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Third</hi> thing is the prejudice of a ſlaviſh fear. 1. It weakens the hands of his People in all duties; for when they begin to fear out of meaſur, they loſe all, and grow indifferent whether they do duty or not. No man will bide by his duty, when his faith faileth him; &amp; if he go about any duty, it will be but as a rat-rime, like the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> when they tell their beeds. The <hi>ſecond prejudice</hi> is diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſoul: nothing can comfort the People of God, where this prevailes. The <hi>third</hi> is the diſcompoſur of their countenance, to the prejudice of Religion: when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it gets upper-hand, it makes them look as if they ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>an hard Maſter,</hi> who puts his People to undergo ſuch things as he will not allow expence for. The <hi>Fourth</hi> is, it diſobliges God to work for their out-gate and deliverance from it, as it's ſaid, <hi>he could do no mighty works, becauſe of their unbelief.</hi> 5. It puts them in an uncapacity to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand their own mercy, when it begins to appear. This ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh fear mude them in <hi>Aegypt</hi> that they could not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid touching their deliverance from it. And when they are in ſuch a caſe of ſlaviſh fear, all duty is a burden to them: it is better for them to bear the ſton-bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row than for them to go-about duty that may tend to their out-gate. And <hi>ſixthly,</hi> Whatever God may do to his People in his Soveraignty and Mercy, the man, that is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſlaviſh fear, has not a promiſe in the Bible to look to that God will help him in ſuch a caſe, <hi>Jac.</hi> 1: <hi>I— let not
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:136247:10"/>
that man think that he ſhall receive any thing of the Lord,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he asketh not in faith.</p>
               <p>The <hi>laſt</hi> thing in the <hi>Doctrine,</hi> is the cure of this diſeaſe: the thing that cures the Diſciples fear is Chriſt's approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them in favour. Behold he cometh, but they miſtake him. There is none of the People of God, but bring Chriſt and them together, he will heal them of all their diſputs and diſeaſes, Chriſt approaches to them, and ſpeaks friendly to them, and ſtill they heard that word, <hi>it is I, be not afraid,</hi> together with his approaching. Will that do it? No: Chriſt adds his authority, rebuking their ſlaviſh fear, although they themſelves have ground to be quieted? yet they can not, untill he ſay <hi>be not afraid, it is I,</hi> I command your Devil to ſit within your ſelf, will that do it? No: there are ſome of them that are peremptor, they will have a ſpecial confirmation, and <hi>Peter</hi> ſteps out before the reſt, —<hi>if it be thou, bid mo come to thee on the water,</hi> otherwiſe I will never believe. Wel <hi>Peter,</hi> muſt ye have a confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation? Ye ſhall have it, but ye ſhall not crack much of it, ere all be don; it may be ye be at a greater doubt, before the end of the day. Then that which compleatly allayeth all their fear, is Chriſt's in-coming to them, and nothing elſe doth it.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Uſe</hi> then, Let all the People of the Lord know there is ſuch an infirmity attending them: when difficultys are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed upon you, and ſlaviſh fear labours to take poſſeſſion of you who are fled to Chriſt, guard againſt it, and know the evils thereof, encourage your ſelves againſt it. When your fear grows in a cloud, and dark day, to prevent it Conſider 1. what intereſt God hath in his People, they are ſet as a ſeal upon his heart, and written upon the palms of his hands; he hath ſaid, <hi>he that toucheth you, toucheth the apple of mine eye.</hi> Would we be afraid, if we believed that any that troubleth the People of God, do as ill as if they took God on the looking face? Indeed and in truth if we believed that, we would think them won gear. 2. Believe this alſo, that whatever the Lord doth or ſuffers men to do, ſhall <hi>work together for the good of his People.</hi> it is a common
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:136247:11"/>
truth in every bodys mouth, yea but I may ſay the leaſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved truth in all the Bible. Ye will not queſtion the truth of the promiſe, but yet ye ſtand at the application. I offer you that inſtance, and put your ſelves to it, if ye can ſolid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acquieſce with it in your heart, that all the diſtreſſes and afflictions his People are under in <hi>Brittain</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> ſhall work together for their good: then if it be ſo, as I do not doubt of it, why then do ye not believe it, and are quiet?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Believe this alſo, that there is nothing that befalls his People; but what is by his Providence: ye ſay, it's true, but there are many things, that we meet with, that God doth not allow. I ſay there is nothing ye meet with, but that which is either by his <hi>active</hi> or <hi>permiſſive Providence. There is no evil don in the city but what the Lord knoweth.</hi> That the Miniſters in <hi>Brittain</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> are put from their houſes, Kirks, and Lands, and baniſhed out of the countrey, is all his Providence, and ſhall work together for their good, and if it be, then ye are to be ſilent. 4. Know this and believe that there is nothing to be fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but God and an evil conſcience. As a man in <hi>Ireland</hi> ſaid to a <hi>Biſhop,</hi> when he threatned to impriſon him, he anſwered, <hi>I know no ſuch priſon as an evil conſcience, and ſo if ye reſolve to fear nothing but the God of Heaven and an evil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, ye need not fear men, for the fear of theſe will quiet all your other fears.</hi>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have told you that the natural life of man may come in competition with the Cauſe and intereſts of Chriſt, and that ſome men will get a free choice in this caſe to ſave or loſe their life, though every one will not get it to their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I have likewiſe told you that the natural life of Man when put to a mans option to ſave or to loſe as he pleaſeth, with denials, or not denial of the Cauſe, was a mighty temptation,—<hi>All that a man hath will he give for his life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But however it might be a mighty tentation, and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:136247:12"/>
many things may occurr in the way to obſtruct the man's right choice in the caſe, yet be it known unto you all, that <hi>whoſoever ſeeketh to ſave his life</hi> with prejudice to the cauſe of Chriſt and a good Conſcience, thereby <hi>loſeth his life</hi>: I was beginning to tell you what wayes a man would ſtudy to ſave his life with prejudice to Chriſt and his cauſe, and he doth ſo either by omitting that which is his duty before God, for fear of his life or for fear of incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences that might follow upon his doing of his duty; or he doth it by committing that which is poſitively ſinfull before God, for fear of his life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt</hi> of all the man prefers his natural life to Chriſt and his cauſe and a good Conſcience, by omitting his duty: and that is 1. when he forbears to teſtifie for God in his place and ſtation, I mean by witneſſing with the mouth for him; this reaches both miniſter and People, when they will not ſpeak for Chriſt's cauſe when it's reproach'd, for fear of hazard: this is to ſeek to ſave their life by omitting of duty.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Folk may be ſaid to ſeek to ſave their life with preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice to the cauſe of Chriſt, by omiſſion of duty in this caſe, when God layes an opportunity of his ſervice and work be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them for the good of his Church; but by reaſon of their faint-heartedneſs they fear, and will not ſet about it, and ſo will not reſcue Chriſt and his cauſe by oppoſing what God calls them to oppoſe. 3. By omitting other duties competent for them in their place and ſtation, or by reaſon of the wicked Laws made againſt ſuch duties by the Supream Magiſtrat, with certification of ſuch and ſuch hazards to occurr upon them, by doing of thoſe duties, as ye ever already heard.</p>
               <p>Having ſpoken to theſe things, we come now to ſpeak of the next great Head of caſes and wayes with prejudice to Chriſt and his cauſe and intereſts and our own Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence poſitively, by doing that which is ſinfull againſt God, and this is don ſeveral and many wayes. There are ſeveral and many caſes, in which Folk may be ſaid to prefer their natural life to Chriſt's cauſe and their own Conſcience,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:136247:12"/>
by commmitting <hi>poſitively</hi> that which is ſinfull againſt GOD. And</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt:</hi> Folk prefers their natural life to Chriſt his inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts and Cauſe, when men do diſclaim the intereſts and cauſe of Chriſt, and all that party, ſide, and faction, becauſe of Chriſt Jeſus and the Truth; I hope it's clear and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out controverſy to you all: if Folk do this for fear of their life, or any peril, or hazard that they may come under, with prejudice to his intereſt and cauſe, that they are ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſave their lives with prejudice to his intereſts and cauſe, and ſo fall-in, under the hazard of the Text of <hi>loſing their life.</hi> This was <hi>Peter's</hi> fault, for as holy a man as he was, he thought he was ſomething hardly put to it, and he being under the apprehenſion that his life might have gon if he had confeſſed his <hi>Maſter,</hi> and ſo judges himſelf to be in hazard, upon that account he doth formally diſclaim Chriſt Jeſus and all that faction and party: —<hi>thou art one of them,</hi> (ſay they) <hi>for thou waſt with him in the garden; thou art one of his Diſciples, thy ſpeech bewrayeth thee</hi>: I vow and ſwear (ſaith he) I am no fanatik, if ye will believe me. And thus he formally diſclaimes Chriſt and his intereſts and Cauſe, and forſware himſelf. This is a very hainous way of ſeeking to ſave our life with prejudice to Chriſt his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts and cauſe and our own conſcience. But</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly</hi>: Some can hardly get it denied but they have been with Chriſt, and one of that party, ſide, and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and one of their ſect, as it's ſaid in the Scripturs; but yet, for fear of their life, they will not only diſclaim that intereſt, party, ſide, and faction; but to put it out of all queſtion that they do ſo, they will now put it under their hand in a covenant, or declaration, (as ye uſe to call it) that they do diſclaim that party, ſide, and way, and ſo that they do judge all their former works and actions in that way and with that party to be ſin, and ſo will ſolemnly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige themſelves by an Oath that they ſhall never owne that intereſt or way any more, if the Supream Magiſtrate put them not to it. I hope ye are all clear that this is one of the moſt hainous wayes that can be choſen for Folks ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſave their lives with prejudice to Chriſt his intereſt
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:136247:13"/>
and cauſe; yet there are many of this generation, that will not only diſclaim that party, ſide, and faction, (for it may he called a <hi>Faction</hi>) but they will alſo put it under their hand in a declaration that they do judge that way their ſin, and ſo ſhall never owne that intereſt or way of Chriſt any more, if the Supream Magiſtrat put them not to it, though he ſhould turn them all <hi>Mahumetans.</hi> I have this much charity to give ſome of their <hi>Lowns,</hi> albeit I have not much to give to any that ever have gon that way, yet I have this much charity to give to ſome of them, that it has been for fear of the loſs of their lives, or for fear of the loſs of ſome perſonal intereſts, that has made them do ſo: if it has been <hi>the wickedneſs of their Principles,</hi> betwixt themand God may it be, my part is clean of it, however let them do it as they will, they have ſought to <hi>ſave their lives</hi> with prejudice to Chriſt his intereſts and cauſe. And there are two great wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes ſtanding againſt them, that ſhall ſtand againſt them before God and man, and that is their <hi>Tongue</hi> and their <hi>Hand,</hi> theſe two ſhall witneſs againſt them before Heaven and Earth, declaring their unparalleled wickedneſs. Ye may perhaps think the taking of that printed paper <hi>the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration</hi> is but a ſmall trivial buſineſs: but I would ask at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſerious godly ſoules, that have the leaſt ſpunk of ingenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty remaining <hi>in</hi> them, that have not ſinned away their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience with this pernicious time, <hi>Sirs,</hi> what would ye think to ſee a printed <hi>Covenant,</hi> ſuch as our <hi>Covenant</hi> was, having ſo many mens names at the end of it, as our <hi>Covenant</hi> hath had in many places, men thinking it their glory to have their <hi>Names</hi> at the end of that <hi>Covenant</hi>; I ſay, what would ye think to ſee another Covenant diſclaiming the former printed Covenant by the ſelf-ſame men that owned the former having their names at the former Covenant, vowing and ſwearing to maintain the Cauſe and Intereſts of Chriſt, having their names at the latter printed <hi>Covenant,</hi> vowing and ſwearing the <hi>quite contrary,</hi> never to owne the <hi>intereſts</hi> of Chriſt any more: what would ye think to ſee the names of theſe <hi>Knaves</hi> now at this latter <hi>Covenant,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fealing againſt their own names at the former Covenant?
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:136247:13"/>
Truely, conſtruct of them as ye will, I think the world may wonder of them, elſe ye may give them charity and the like; but if God write not another Bible, I have none to give them, conſtruct of them as ye will. It's a ſhame in the ſight of the Nations for men to falſifie their own deed before Sun and Moon, Heaven and Earth, God and man, to put it under their hand that they ſhall never owne the <hi>Intereſts</hi> of Chriſt contrary to their Oath; the hainouſeſt perjury they put upon themſelves that ever men put upon themſelves, or that ever we read of either in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur or in any other hiſtory: this is one of the moſt hainous wayes that ever men took for ſhuning of <hi>perſonal hazards,</hi> with prejudice to Chriſt his intereſts and cauſe; if they loſe not their <hi>life</hi> many of them, we wonder, and that ſome will poſſibly ſee it, ere long, though perhaps we ſhall not be much witneſs to it, yet there will be witneſſes to it, ere the dreadfull <hi>day of Doom.</hi> Folk ſets alwayes long termes. But</p>
               <p>There's a <hi>Third</hi> way that many <hi>ſeek to ſave their lives</hi> with prejudice to Chriſt's cauſe, by doing ſomething that's <hi>poſitively ſinfull</hi> before God, and that is neither by diſclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt and his cauſe, and party, and ſide, nor yet by puting it under their hand that they ſhall never owne that party nor way any more; but it is, by joining of intereſt and iſſue with thoſe Enemies that have ſo don, there's a joining of their intereſts with thoſe that have ſo done, that God looks on as very hainous in his ſight. There are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wayes of joining intereſts and iſſue with that party: there are many plotings and complotings and workings to and fro to their hands amongſt us in this matter. How be it we have ſo much charity to give to ſome of them that have ſo done, that it's not ſo much out of malice that they have don ſo [perhaps], as the <hi>fear of perſonal hazards,</hi> which has made them join iſſue and intereſts with that party. But however here I ſhall give you ſome wayes and caſes in which men do join intereſt and iſſue with the Enemies of God; and though I will not ſay that all theſe, that I am about to name, may be properly applied to thoſe that may be called <hi>the Enemies of God,</hi> yet having theſe, or any of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:136247:14"/>
theſe, they look with very <hi>black marks</hi>; and though I will not ſay that one, that's guilty of one or them, will be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of all of them, yet I judge one of them uſeth to follow another in a mans practice, ſo God's judicial plagues bring them to an height. Ye will find alwayes of a Peoples joining of intereſts and iſſues with God's profeſſed Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, in the Prophecy of <hi>Obadiah,</hi> they run all to the caſe of <hi>Eſau</hi> there, in the name of <hi>Edom, Jacob's</hi> baſtard bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, a <hi>Lown,</hi> that had <hi>ſold his birth-right</hi> for a fill of his own foul belly, and he had ſtill an ill-will to the honeſt lad <hi>Jacob,</hi> and ſo whenever he got an opportunity, he joined iſſue and intereſt with thoſe that were his profeſſed Enemies: and ye will ſee many things brought in there, that God charges him with. This may be very properly applied to many within our times, that have joined intereſt and iſſue with that Party that's the Enemies of God and Church at this time, to lay their hand to their heart, and ſee whether or not they ſpeak not their very caſe and theirs.</p>
               <p>Firſt: This there charged upon <hi>Edom,</hi> is, <hi>In the day of thy Brothers affliction thou ſtoodſt on the other ſide.</hi> Now that ye may underſtand the matter, ye muſt take it up thus: There were <hi>two Partys</hi> in that day, ſtanding confronted over againſt another, <hi>videlicet,</hi> poor <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſtanding on the one ſide, and <hi>Iſraels</hi> Enemies, that had invaded them, ſtanding on the other ſide; <hi>Edom</hi> is a baſtard brother in the houſe, and he comes-in, for his own hand, and ſides with <hi>Iſraels</hi> Enemies. When God had placed the <hi>two Partys</hi> one againſt another, <hi>Edom</hi> comes in, and when he ſhould have ſided with the People of God, he ſides with the Enemies of the People of God; ſo ſoon as he knew who were the profeſſed Enemies of the People of God, he ſided with them, he <hi>ſtood on the other ſide.</hi> It's like he declared not himſelf to be an Enemy at the firſt, but he <hi>ſtood on the other ſide,</hi> and that was enough to declare him to be one of the Enemies of <hi>Jacob.</hi> There are ſome of you who will ſpeak nothing againſt the People of God, and ye will not declare t;o be Enemies, but yet ye will ſpeak as little good for them for all that, and that ſayes <hi>ye ſtand upon the other ſide,</hi>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:136247:14"/>
els ye would help when they are in need; your indifferency in ſuch a day will prove you to be Enemies of the People of God, and ere long, in God's righteous judgment, it's like ye'l go the full length, if ye be ſtanding there, els ye will not ſtand long there, God will declare you to be rank Enemies to his Cauſe and People. It is not good to ſide with God's Enemies either in jeſt or in earneſt. There is not much word of ſome of our compliances yet, but we <hi>ſtand on the other ſide</hi> for all that. Truely I fear you very ſore ere all be don: then it's enough to declare any man to be a joyner of iſſue and intereſts with God's enemies and the enemies of his People, becauſe though they ſpeak no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing againſt the People of God, yet they ſpeak nothing for them, in the day of their affliction; <hi>thou ſtoodſt on the other ſide, in the day of thy Brother's affliction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. It's charged on them there, that they <hi>rejoiced at Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob's affliction, and at the proſperity of their Enemies,</hi> that's another ſtep of compliance or joyning of intereſt and iſſue with them, rejoicing at the Enemies proſperity, and at their ſucceſs, and at the calamity and deſtruction of the People of God. Indeed quoth ſome, I am not guilty of that, I had rather have them that ye call <hi>the People of God</hi> upmoſt; do ye ſo? What think ye then of the keeping of days of Thankſgiving? then ye may ſay, ye kept thoſe days, on this account and on that account. Yes ye may put Folk by ſo, but ſee if ye put God and your own conſcience by ſo. God knowes on what account ye kept thoſe days of thankſgiving. I defie you or any elſe on any account. But ye juſtifie all the Goſpel work, that the Enemies have don for the overthrow of the work of God in theſe Lands. Ye may go about the buſh with me, how to find our diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, but gang about it, as ye will, (my Friend) I ſhall hook you: for the matter ſtands directly thus, that on one of theſe <hi>two</hi> accounts ye behooved to rejoice at, either at the proſperity of the <hi>wicked,</hi> or at the adverſity of the <hi>godly.</hi> For juſt in the day of our affliction, when our Worthies fell, and when our Government and Miniſters were cried down, and all the conjured Enemies of our Lord Jeſus
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:136247:15"/>
Chriſt got up, then Head and Miſchief by our Rulers eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by a Law, that day ye ſtated your day of thanksgiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Know ye how, and what at ye rejoiced? Lay then your hand to your hearts, and read that Scriptur, it's only <hi>Jacob</hi> that is in affliction; and its not only the wicked crew, <hi>Jacobs</hi> enemies that are exalted. Now lay your hand to your hearts, and learn to know on what account ye rejoic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and know that ye are but baſtard brethren, rejoicing at the proſperity of the enemies of Jeſus, and at the affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction or <hi>Jacob,</hi> and know what hazard ye are in. Indeed perhaps ye may ſay, it was the fear of your life, or fear of inconveniences, that might follow on your not keeping of ſuch dayes; ye may loſe your means, or ye may loſe your life, or ſomething that belongs to life. Indeed I believe you now, I ſeek no more of you than that, that's enough to prove that ye have ſought your life, to ſave them, with prejudice to Chriſt and his Cauſe, by thy keeping of a day of thankſgiving. Indeed I give you that much charity, that it has been for fear of your life, or ſome inconveniency that has made you keep a day of thankſgiving, with preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice to Chriſt and his Cauſe. If it has been but the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs of your principles, it's the worſe of that, betwixt you and God may it be. But I give you the charity, that it has been for fear of your life, or ſome inconveniencies, that has made you wrong the cauſe of Chriſt, by keeping a day of Thanksgiving.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is this charged on <hi>Edom,</hi> and ye may take it as another degree of joining intereſt and iſſue with God's ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and it is this, <hi>neither ſhould they have ſpoken proudly in the day of his diſtreſs.</hi> There are ſome, that are given to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mologat the courſes of the time, and yet they have no will to be called the enemies of the People of God, and they have as ill will to be called <hi>Phanatiks</hi>: but they are even ſuch fools as are given to take a rant ſometimes; and not to give them too much charity, it's to be judged they will take ſome more than ordinary, for fear they be judged pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natiks: and when they are taking their rant, they will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach the poor People of God thus: <hi>It's wel war'd on
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:136247:15"/>
them: they were all grown ſo proud, that they could be tolerat: they could not but meet with a miſchief, thy were all grown ſo proud, ſo ſaucy, and ſo preciſe, there could not better come of them.</hi> Wel, be doing ſo, talk-on ſo; but remember that this is no ſmall part and way of joining iſſue and intereſt with God's enemies, and remember ye are of the black band that hath <hi>ſpoken proudly in the day of Jacobs affliction.</hi> What is the cauſe I pray you. Was it not, that ye your ſelves ſhould not be ſuſpected to be of that Party that's cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Phanatiks,</hi> that ſo ye might not be under the hazard they are in at this time? Therefore ye have ſpoken ſo proudly againſt that Party in the day of their affliction. It had not been ſo ill for you to have called them ſo in the day of their proſperity. But in this ye are exceeding guilty, that ye have ſpoken proudly in the day of <hi>Jacobs</hi> diſtreſs and affliction.</p>
               <p n="4">4. There is this charged on <hi>Edom,</hi> and ye may take it here as another ſtep and degree of compliance with the enemies of God, <hi>neither ſhouldſt thou have laid thy hand on thy Brothers ſubſtance in the day that ſtrangers carried away his forces.</hi> Will any body think ye, that proſeſſes love to the cauſe, take an harl of an honeſt man's gear, when its going for the Cauſe and Covenant and work of <hi>Reformation?</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I'l warrand you, that they will. Its true, none I know that has love really to the Cauſe and Covenant and work of Reformation will do ſo. But I know enough of <hi>Lowns</hi> that have profeſſed much love to the Work, will be very glad to winn a days wages, to drive an honeſt man's pound, when it's going for the work of Reformation, and many will not hook to put-in their hand among the honeſt mans gear, when it's going for the Work of Reformation, and take a good deal of it. Will ye do ſo? Then truely it ſhall be the deareſt gear that ever ye wan in your life. Will the <hi>States</hi> take a fine of a man, for promoving of the work of God? And will ye take any off-fallings, that ye can get? Will ye lay your hand on your Brothers ſubſtance in the day of his diſtreſs? Take it as ye will, but ye may as wel take God's vengeance, as take it: and if ye take it, ye ſhall
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:136247:16"/>
take God's vengeance with it. It ſhall be the deareſt gear in your aught the thing that ye take of them that way, if ye take any thing of the People of God, for the Covenant and Work of Reformation, or for any thing relating thereunto, believe it, ye ſhall get the broad curſe of God with it, that ſhall crow in their crop, and burſt out at the broad ſide, and turn out that which is in or you, that all the world ſhall ſee as wel within as without: and withall know aſſuredly this is one of the higheſt wayes of joining iſſues and intereſts with God's enemies, that the Spirit of God hath left on record in the Scriptur; and know ye are once ſcrued up and over among the <hi>black band,</hi> and God knows when ye ſhall come-off again.</p>
               <p n="5">5. There is this there charged on <hi>Edom,</hi> and ye may take it likewiſe as another ſtep and degree of compliance, and that is, <hi>thou ſtoodſt on the croſs way to cut-off thoſe of his that did remain.</hi> There is even ſome folk at this preſent that has not gone the full length they reſolve, that from the Work of God are going over the bray, and the People of God is like to be ruined, as its to lend all a putt together, to put all further wrong, to reproach any thing that remaines. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed enemies have gotten the one wheel of the work of God over the bray, and ye wait wel under thumb to get the other put over the bray alſo, the vote and cauſe will go againſt them. Quoth ye, we can not help it, and we need not caſt our ſelves into needleſs hazards, from the work be going, let it go, and from that party be going, let them even go, we need not ſpeak for them, for they will over the bray, be as it will, therefore let us vote even as the reſt vote, leſt we bring our ſelves into hazard. I know there are ſome of you that would not have taken the lives of thoſe that were execut at this time, nay but ye will not hook to reproach them for all that, and amongſt the enemies of God not care to ſay they were guilty of death: its an high way of joining intereſt and iſſue with that Party: hereby ye <hi>ſeek to ſave your life,</hi> with prejudice to Chriſt his cauſe, intereſts, and People.

Wherefore do ye ſo? Is it not that ye your ſelves ſhould not be ſuſpected to be one of that Party? or is out of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice that ye do ſo?

I ſhall not ſpeak much more upon it: but remember this general head, that though ye do not diſclaim Chriſt, nor his Cauſe, nor yet take the declaration, yet that there is a joining of iſſue and intereſt with that Party that are the profeſſed enemies of God, that ye have ſo don for perſonal hazards, and it goes readily from one degree to another, till it winn to the laſt.</p>

They begin and they ſide with that Party that is the enemies of the Church of God, and will ſpeak but little, and debate for that Party, and they will ſpeak nothing againſt the People of God, yet they will ſay as little for them; but they will ſtand on the other ſide, and indeed if they be there, they will gang alittle further the next time, and profeſs that they have reaſon to evidence ſomething of joy, for the ſucceſs and proſperity of the wicked, at leſt to profeſs joy in that caſe, for fear of hazard or inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, once being there, they will not ſtand much to ſpeak proudly, and teſtifie againſt the People of God in affliction, and to blame them thus, that it is all juſtly come upon them, they were all ſo proud, that they could not ſtand; indeed when once they be at this, to reproach the People of God thus, without all debate when they ſee their gear going for the <hi>Covenant</hi> and <hi>Cauſe</hi> and <hi>Work</hi> of <hi>Reformation,</hi> if they get opportunity of any thing that is ado, they will even find in their heart to take a clat of it. Indeed when once they be at that with it, they will take a clat of an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt mans gear, when it is going for the honeſt <hi>Cauſe</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out debate, they will not ſpare to ſtand in the croſs-way to cut-off thoſe of his that doth remain. Wo them! I no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing doubt, if they be cuting-off any thing of the Work of God, that remaines, but they will diſcover any that they know hidd, that they think will come into the calk, for that work. If they do all the reſt, doubtleſs when they come to their own companions, and have taken a rant, they will drink to the confuſion of the <hi>Covenant</hi> and all the <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natiks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now ye ſee there are many ways of joining intereſts and iſſues with the Enemies of God, and gang from leſs to more, from one degree unto another, till God in his righteous judgment lay-on the laſt ſtone, as their plague: it may be ye are but ſtanding on the other ſide to day yet, and if ye be ſpeaking nothing for the People of God, ye are ſpeaking as little againſt them.

                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:136247:17"/>
                  <hi>Fourthly:</hi> There is a way that men prefer their <hi>natural life</hi> to the Cauſe and intereſts of Chriſt by doing that which is <hi>poſitively ſinfull,</hi> and that by giving obedience to ſinfull Acts and Laws, for fear of perſonal hazard, is ſuch a thing as I know to be iniquous and ſinfull; but there comes out ſuch a Law from the Supream Magiſtrat, that ſuch a thing muſt be done, or then be liable to ſuch and ſuch hazard, and for fear of that hazard I give obedience to that iniquous Law, and that way ſeek to ſave my life with prejudice to Chriſt and his Cauſe. This was the caſe of the three child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren that were put to it at <hi>Babylon,</hi> but they did not obey; there came out a wicked Law againſt them, that whenever they heard all the bagg-pipes blow, they ſhould without any more fall down and worſhip the <hi>idol</hi> that <hi>Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar</hi> had ſet up, or then take it upon their peril to be caſt into the firy fornace. O! but the three children made a fair and honeſt choiſe, Be it known to you all Gentiles, quoth they if the bagg-pipes ſhould blow till they burſt again, we will not fall down and worſhip the <hi>Idol</hi> that <hi>Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar</hi> has ſet-up; if our God pleaſe, he can deliver us, but whether he will deliver us or not, we will not bow down to your <hi>glecks.</hi> O! but they made a fair choice! There are many Folks now in our days, I think, if the King would command the moſt iniquous Law that ever was command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a church, I doubt not but they would give obedience thereunto, for fear of inconveniencies that they fear would come upon them for their diſobedience: they have given a great proof of this already, and a greater proof than this can not be given, for they have ſworn that <hi>his Majeſtys will ſhall be the rule, according to which they ſhall level all their actions.</hi> I hope it is clear to you all, that theſe <hi>Lowns</hi> have taken a ſinfull way to ſave their life, with prejudice to Chriſt and his Cauſe, as ever was taken. I am ſure their lives muſt be in hazard.</p>
               <p>The next I propoſed to ſpeak to, was, What <hi>pretences</hi> have men to ſay, for their own defence, for this unhappy way of complyance. What ſhaddow or pretext have they for this? Have they nothing to ſay for themſelves, for
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:136247:18"/>
taking of ſuch an uncanny gate as this? Yes, that they have, it is an ill deed but they'l alwayes get ſome excuſe for it: and ſo they have much to ſay for their evil deeds too: they have many pretences and reaſons for their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence here, though I hope ye are all clear, that no pretext or reaſons formable can be given, without a ragg about the foot of them. No formable reaſon can be given why men ſeek to ſave their lives with prejudice to Chriſt and his Cauſe, but ſuch as they are they have enough of them, and ye ſhall judge them, for I ſhall give you an inſtance of ſome few of them. Now let every man lay his hand to his heart, and be judge here.</p>
               <p>The <hi>firſt pretext</hi> that we ſhall name, which many have for their compliance, is this, <hi>LAW and AUTHORITY,</hi> there is Law and Authority for the thing. When we ſay, what meant ye to comply, and take that unhappy courſe by the end? they chuſe this goodly pretence, there is Law and Authority for it: in this they fortifie themſelves in all their abominable courſes, <hi>there is Law and Authority for ſuch things.</hi> Wilt thou tell me? O man, if thou haſt any ſpunk of ingenuity remaining in thee, whether or not was there not Law and authority at <hi>Babylon</hi> for the three child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren to fall down and worſhip the graven image that <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar</hi> the King ſet-up? Though this Law and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority came from the King, yet it was not a <hi>lawfull</hi> autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, &amp; therefore they behoved to ſay to the King in this, we will neither obey Law nor Authority. Or wilt thou tell me man, of all the <hi>Martyrs</hi> that ever thou heardſt of martyred for the Cauſe of Chriſt, if ever any of them was martyred without a ſhaddow of Law and Authority, ſave ſome that have been killed ſecretly. Any that were brought to any publick hearing, there was alwayes ſome ſhaddow of Law and authority laid againſt them. Was it not ſo from the beginning? All the cruelty that ever was done to Chriſt, his Church, and his Cauſe, ſince the beginning, it was ſtill ſent-out with ſome ſhaddow of Law and authority, it was ſtill ſo ſince the beginning. I think, man, if thou wert a man, and not a beaſt, thou ſhouldſt reſolve not to make thy

                  </gap> ſubject to all the iniquous Laws that may come through a Land. I mean'd one that has rational underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing above a beaſt ſhould know that he ſhould not make his Conſcience ſubject to all the iniquous Laws that come through the world. I had thoughts that thou that art a man <hi>baptized into the name of Father, Son, and holy Ghoſt,</hi> there is ſome ſpunk of ingenuity left within thee, that thou ſhouldſt know this much, that the humane Laws of the <hi>Prince</hi> do not make void all the Divine Laws and authority of our Lord Jeſus upon the conſciences of men. I mean'd when a Divine Law and an humane law had confronted, in oppoſition one to another, that the Divine Law was to make void the humane: but I never knew that the humane laws of the Prince made void all the Divine laws of Chriſt before. I never heard that doctrin taught, but within theſe four years, God be thanked. Short while may the Law of the Prince laſt, that makes void all the Divine Laws and authority of our bleſſed Lord Jeſus. Truely, man, thou haſt a bony plea of it, thou muſt fell thy conſcience, abjure the <hi>Covenant,</hi> and comply with their iniquous laws and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority for it. If thou art a man, and not a beaſt, <hi>man,</hi> I think thou ſhouldſt know this, that it is more lawfull to obey God than man. The Apoſtle made greateſt enemies judges in this matter, <hi>whether it be moſt lawfull to obey God rather than man, judge ye.</hi> But ye muſt obey man, though oppoſit to all the commands of God. The King's laws are for this, quoth ye, there is law and authority for it. True<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ye have a bony plea of it, a brave pretence of it forſooth. I think a man baptized into the Name of the Father, Son, and holy Ghoſt, ſhould think ſhame to inſtance ſuch a pretext. It's even like your ſelf, there is law and authority for it. There are many alſo who for their compliance pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend loyalty to their <hi>Prince</hi>: they muſt comply, they muſt abjure the <hi>Covenant,</hi> that they may prove their loyalty &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects to his <hi>Majeſtys</hi> grace. Goodſooth let me tell it quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly betwixt me and you, there is few good news in the land, ſince the like of you became ſo <hi>loyal.</hi> If our King had been a man qualified with grace, as once we ſuppoſed him to be,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:136247:19"/>
and had born down <hi>vice</hi> and <hi>profanity,</hi> there had not been ſo much loyalty in the breaſts of a thouſand of you, as is in the breaſt of one of you, at this day. Alwayes I thought it had been true loyalty to the Prince, to have keeped him in his own room, and given him his own due, to have keeped him <hi>ſubordinat</hi> to Chriſt, and his <hi>laws ſubordinat</hi> to the Laws of Chriſt. I thought true loyalty to the Prince had been to have keeped his Houſe in the <hi>line of ſubordination</hi> to the fear of God. <hi>Fear God, and honour the King,</hi> I judged that had ſtood wel in all the world; but there is a genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion now, that has turned it even contrary, <hi>Fear the King, and then honour God.</hi> I thought never that that was true loyalty yet: I never heard that doctrin taught before: but I thought alwayes that was true loyalty, <hi>Fear God, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the Prince.</hi> God's vengeance be on them that have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered that Divine law, ever, untill they ſet as good an one in the place of it. They made the rule all wrong, that put the King in the firſt place: he will never ſtand wel there. I do think men of rational judgment, that have not ſold themſelves to this iniquous time, will think it the true ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Prince, to keep him in the line of <hi>ſubordination</hi> to God's honour, <hi>Fear God, and honour the King.</hi> He is the beſt ſubject, who is the beſt Chriſtian. And ask ſome, What makes you take ſuch a miſchievous courſe by the end, for the overthrow of the work of God? O! I behov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to prove my loyalty to my Prince: ye underſtand not there are many who queſtion my loyalty now. In truth, <hi>Sir,</hi> ſay I, there is many a better man, than ever ſtood on your ſhinnes, or his either, that queſtions your loyalty now to the God of heaven. Will ye make this once clear in the firſt place, that ye are a loyal ſubject to the God of heaven, and then prove your loyalty to your Prince, by things that do not contradict the Scriptures of Truth and the Laws of the God of heaven. It is never a ſoncy loyalty that makes folk to quite their Religion. Tho his Religion juſtled againſt that which they accounted loyalty, they charged him with this, that his way was a way of <hi>ſedition</hi> and <hi>hereſy.</hi> His way did not prove him to be loyal enough.
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:136247:19"/>
Wel, ſaith he, I am a loyal ſubject for all that, after that way, ſo <hi>I worſhip the God of my Fathers:</hi> if that be hereſy, quoth ye, I am an heretik; if that be rebellion againſt the Prince, I am a rebell to him, for ſo <hi>worſhip I the God of my Fathers.</hi> But albeit ye will quite with your Religion, to prove your loyalty to your Prince, yet truely we will not do ſo. And if ye call ſuch <hi>Fanatiks,</hi> that take the way we do, then we are ſuch, <hi>after the way, that ye call</hi> Fanaticiſme, <hi>ſo worſhip we the God of our Fathers</hi>: we may not quite with our Religion, albeit ye call it by the name of <hi>Treaſon, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſy, Rebellion,</hi> and <hi>Diviſion</hi>: hold ye by your thing, and we will hold us by our thing: it is always beſt for Folks to hold them ſtill by their own thing.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is many Folks, who for their compliance pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend <hi>peace to the Church, and to themſelves.</hi> Know ye not what diſcord and miſchief that way breeds every where? Quoth ye, I am even gon the length, I am gon, for peace, in ſome caſes. <hi>Peace,</hi> man, <hi>peace,</hi> man, I pray thee, what peace wouldſt thou? wouldſt thou have peace with God's enemies, that has deſtroyed all that is precious in our ſight? Whom with would ye have peace? I hope ye may have peace with all the People of God, without compliance. Why then tell ye us, that we ſhould keep peace with a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that has deſtroyed all the work of God?

There are many who pretend this for their compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, even <hi>uſefulneſs to the Church,</hi> in their caſes, they ſay they have done what they have done of that kind, that they may be uſefull to the work of God in other caſes. What moved thee to comply, <hi>Man,</hi> and run with that unhappy party ſo great a length, for the overthrow of the work of God? But ye underſtand not my drift in it, it was that I might get credit from them, and thereby I will have place, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to ſpeak for the People of God, and for the Cauſe, and ſo this is a way to be uſefull for the Work of God, by their puting credit upon me, that way, I will have a fair opportunity to get many a good turn don in the favour of honeſt men. Gang thy way, <hi>Man,</hi> the vengeance of God gang with thee, for we will either have good God's gate, or will never have good at all, for good is not good, if it come not God's gate: we look never that God will triſt us with good through ſuch foul fingers as yours; we look that God will triſt us with good through a cleanlier hand. But I never knew that this was your duty to do evil, that good might come of it: I never knew that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur ſtated the matter thus, that Folk ſhould do evil, than good might come of it. I ween'd ay that Folk ſhould have done good at preſent, if they would have had good to have followed on it. But I never knew that Folk was to do evil, that good might follow, I never read that in all the Bible, and I have read it all from the one end to the other, and ſome of it twice over, but I never read that in it all. Go thy way, <hi>Man,</hi> the vengeance of God gang with thee; for we look never for good at the like of thy hand. I dare ſay, if it were not more reſpect to thy carnal intereſts, that thou lookſt moſt to, than any reſpect that thou haſt to the Cauſe of Chriſt and his People, thou wouldſt never have gon the length thou haſt gon, God reward you for that ye have don to Chriſt and his Cauſe, and ſo he will, in his own due time, ye will get the Devil to your thanks yet, for the good ye have don to the Cauſe of Chriſt and his People by compliance.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:136247:22"/>But there are many likewiſe who have this pretext for their compliance, they profeſs to be keeping their <hi>life</hi> till a better time: it is a ſin to us to let our life, and what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to us gang this gate, we may keep our life till a better time: indeed, as I was telling you before, I never heard tell, that that man's life did ever any more good to Chriſt and his Cauſe, that once did compet therewith, and was preferred thereunto, and ſo was brought-off with preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice to the ſame; God will never be in ſuch a <hi>Knaves</hi> common, as thine, to prefer thy life with that honour, as to make it uſefull for the Cauſe of Chriſt again, who has preferred thy life to the Cauſe. I ween'd the Scriptur had arted thee better, <hi>Man,</hi> that <hi>he that is faithfull in the little, will be faithfull in the greater,</hi> and he that is not faithfull in little, will not be faitfull in much. We will never honour ſuch as have denied his Cauſe, to make them uſefull for the Cauſe and Work again, ſuch as is faithfull in the little, and <hi>keeps his garments clean,</hi> in an evil time, God will prefer that honeſt man with taking a good turn of his hand, for his Cauſe and People. He will take nothing of a <hi>Lown's</hi> hand that has defiled himſelf, and has not been faithfull in the little. Let ſtill that ſound in your ears, that he that is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in the little, will be faithfull in the much; he that is not faithfull in the little, will not be faithfull in the much. I'l wad ye ſhall ſee theſe children, that have gon that gate, and are keeping their life till a better time, goodſooth I'l wad that ye ſhall ſee an evil time take them. Goodſooth they will look with clear eyes that ever will ſee their life do a good turn more in this world. I believe the moſt part of them, if not all of them, is kept for a black hour. They will look with clear eyes, that ever will ſee them get a good time, or yet be uſefull to the Church in this world again.</p>
               <p>There are many likewiſe that have this pretext for their compliance, that they do what they do that way out of no ill intention, it was upon ſuch good accounts that they did ſuch and ſuch things, we had no ill intention in ſo doing, we intended to wrong no man, far be it from us to perſecut
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:136247:23"/>
or bid any body do any thing againſt their Light, we had no ill intention in what we have don. Ye have a bony pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text of it forſooth! I ſhall deſire any man to ſearch through all the Scripturs, and ſee if any ſuch a thing be to be found in them, of God's ſtating mens honeſty upon good inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, while the good intentions brought-forth evil fruit, I never read ſuch a thing in all the Bible.

               <p>But in the next place I ſuppoſe that this is as ordinary a pretext among us, for compliance, as any. What could my bare teſtimony do to it? it could not turn the chaſe: all that Party, Side, &amp; Way, that ye ſay is for Jeſus Chriſt, they are all dung down, ere ever I ſided with any Party. We might wel have caſt our ſelves into hazard, by doing or ſpeaking for that way, but that could never have don the turn, it would never have turned the chaſe. What could my ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing have don, for keeping in the Miniſters, when Acts and Laws was for their caſting-out? it would never have don good, I might wel have caſt my ſelf into hazard. What could my vote have done for ſuch a mans life, that Acts and Laws were for the execution of? And when once it was ſo, what need we hazard our ſelves needleſly? For what would the teſtimony of ſilly poor laſſes and lads have done?</p>
               <p>A bony pretence ye have of it forſooth! I never read it in all the Scripturs where ever God made a mans fore-ſight

of events the meaſur of his actions in duty. I never heard that a man was to ſhift his duty upon that account, becauſe he thought his duty would not have good conſequences. I never underſtood that before, that iſſues and events be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to us. I weend ay known duty had belonged to us, but iſſues and events had belonged to God. Indeed the <hi>Prophets,</hi> that the Lord ſent forth long ſince to ſpeak in his Name, had a little more ground to ſhift their duty, when God told them the iſſue and event would not prove good, yet they durſt not for their life ſhift their duty even in that caſe: <hi>Go,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ſpeak to this People, but they are a ſtiff-necked and rebellious people, they will not hear.</hi> Will they not hear, might they ſay, then we will never ſpeak to them, it is but folly to caſt our ſelves into hazard, when it needs not. We may as wel gang and ſpeak to ſtocks and ſtones, and they will not perſecut us, ſince the thing we ſpeak will have alike effect upon both. Whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, ſpeak ye my word to them, or their blood will I require at your hand: ſpeak, when God bids you ſpeak, whether there come evil or good of it; if ye will not, God will make your tongues to fry and flutter upon the hot coals of Hell, he will garr it blutter and blyze upon the burning coals of hell. Speak, Sir, when God bids you ſpeak, or he will garr that tongue that he hath put into your mouth, pople and play in the pow pot of hell. Ye have a bony pretence of it, <hi>Man,</hi> your bare teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony will not turn the chaſe. <hi>Sir,</hi> did thoſe <hi>two Witneſſes</hi> in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> that <hi>propheſied in ſaccloath,</hi> by their teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony turn the chaſe? yet they were to witneſs againſt the abominations of the time, till they were <hi>ſlain</hi> for all that. Folk have gotten a brave gate of it now forſooth, rhat they will ſpeak nothing for the Cauſe of Chriſt now, becauſe that will not turn the chaſe. Speak, when God calls you to ſpeak, or he will garr you do worſe in a worſe time. At laſt when Folks have made all the pretences they can make, in end they muſt even come to this, I dought not ſtand it out for fear, fleſh and blood would not do it, when I conſidered the hardſhips, that now the People of God is in hazard of,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:136247:24"/>
of ripping-up of the noſe, and cuting-off of the ears and hands, and loſing of the life, it was ſo terrible to me, while fleſh &amp; bloud would not ſerve me to ſtand it out. Indeed it's even the beſt and moſt honeſt pretence of all that ye have had yet from the beginning; yet there is no conſolation to you from this Text, I would have you to remember that the Text ſpeaks peremptorily, <hi>he that ſeeks to ſave his life, ſhall loſe it.</hi> I have not a diſpenſation to grant you from theſe words, but I ſhall read-over the good Text of our Lord Jeſus to you, that will ſpeak better for it ſelf than I or any body that will ſpeak on it, <hi>he that ſeeks to ſave his life ſhall loſe it.</hi> See if that grants you a diſpenſation. The man his heart would not ſerve him to ſtand it out, yea but he that ſeeks to ſave his life (ſaith the Text) ſhall loſe it. Alas! my fleſh and blood dought not do it, my fear mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me to ſuch a courſe, <hi>he that ſeeks to ſave his life, ſhall loſe it.</hi> O! I had great tentations, many burdens, wife, and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, which my care was engaged for, I could not get it ſtood out, <hi>he that ſeeks to ſave his life ſhall loſe it</hi>: a dreadfull word, that may make you all tremble, <hi>he that ſeeks to ſave his life ſhall loſe it</hi>! Never make a pretext of your own weakneſs; never make a pretext of this, that other Folk that had more wit than ye<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> did ſuch a thing before you, though ye were not clear in it, yet that ye thought that they behoved to be clear in it, there is no excuſe to you from this, <hi>he that ſeeks to ſave his life ſhall loſe it.</hi> Ye ſaw many that ye judged <hi>good</hi> and <hi>godly</hi> doing ſo, that is no excuſe for you, fra ye ſaw an appearance of evil, <hi>he that ſeeks to ſave his life ſhall loſe it.</hi> Therefore I charge you in the Name and Authority of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, when ye ſee the Cauſe of Chriſt on the one ſide, and your Life on the other ſide, competing and juſtling againſt one another, that ye make a right choiſe, for the good of the Cauſe, or ye ſhall come under the hazard of this Text, <hi>he that ſeeks to ſave his life ſhall loſe it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A <hi>Third</hi> thing we would ſpeak a word to, is this:
<list>
                     <item>1. What way doth the Folk loſe their life; that goeth about ſo prepoſterouſly to ſave their life, either by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:136247:24"/>
that which is their ſin, or for fear of perſonal ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, doing that which is wrong?</item>
                     <item>2. How do they loſe their lives?</item>
                     <item>3. What ſort of Life is this, that they loſe?</item>
                     <item>4. What is mean'd, by loſing their life?</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Here <hi>Firſt</hi> of all, they loſe their life, as they loſe life ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting thereby, for Chriſt hath in even-down terms ſaid in the words following, <hi>He that denieth me before men, him will I deny before the Father and the holy Angels.</hi> In truth then if he deny you, I know not who will own you in that day, none of all that Court and Side that he is on will own you: but I know another Court that will own you, believe, even the court and ſide of all the Devils in hell, they will own you, they will know you wel enough, believe, they will gather all together about the poor Soul, as ſo many greedy crows about a gushorn, every one gripping it ſtraiter in their clooks than another. But none of that court will own you, all that Court will ſay, I know you not, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ye were their born brother: they dare not ſay, they know you in that day, if Chriſt know you not: it's ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life that ye will loſe, my Dove, by taking ſuch pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſterous wayes, to ſave it, that's a ſore word, O! but that's a great pawn, ye loſe life, as thereby ye will loſe life everlaſting. O! that's a pawn ye ſhall never exchange again, — <hi>what ſhall a man give in exchange for his Soul?</hi> Prove your loyalty to your Prince by loſing of your Soul that gate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> They loſe their natural life, as God's bleſſing to them. Mans natural life, while God calls him not to lay it down, is God's bleſſing to him; but if God call for it, and he lay it not down, it is no more God's bleſſing to him, but God's curſe; he holds it no more of God, but of the Devil in hell: the ſaving of his life is God's plague and vengeance on him, his life after that is God's plague and curſe to him, he holds it no more of God: and that time, when God calls for his life, and he layes it not down, he forfeits his right holding of his life in God, and fo he loſeth his life, as he loſeth God's bleſſing upon his natural
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:136247:25"/>
life, he has loſt his life as God's bleſſing, and he holds it as God's curſe, he ſhall never have power again by his life to committ a good deed, all the actions again proceeding from that life ſhall be curſed, curſed in his in-going &amp; in his outgoing, in his basket, &amp; in his ſtore, and in every thing he doth: he may build houſes, and buy land after that, but all ſhall be accurſed, all the actions proceeding from that curſed life ſhall be curſed, live they long, or live he ſhort, the curſe of God ſhall fall upon him, though he ſhould live to be the ſinner of an hundred years old, he ſhall be accurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, his life curſed, his actions curſed, all that he doth ſhall be but fuel to the curſe of God that ſhall light broad flaught upon him, he ſhall eat, and drink, and wear in the curſe of God, he ſhall feed and live upon the curſe of God, and the curſe of God ſhall feed and live upon him, he ſhall hold bed and boord on the curſe of God, and the curſe of God ſhall hold bed and boord on him, that way they ſhall loſe their life, they ſhall loſe it as God's bleſſing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly</hi>: The man that goes thus prepoſterouſly about to ſave his life, he ſhall loſe his life ſo, as within alittle he ſhall loſe the comfort of his life, within alittle he ſhall be full of Hells ſorrow, hells terror ſhall ſeize upon him, the worm that never dyes ſhall begin an inward gnawing at his heart, the worm of an ill conſcience rugging at his heart, and intrals of him, like a canker-worm drawing at his lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, an inward flame like the fire of hell ready to burn him up within, ere ever death come, to take-away the curſed carcaſe of him, the gnawing worm that never dyeth ſhall ever draw at the conſcience of him, like a greedy glade riv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at a guſhorn ay as if the Devil were within going to rive out the Soul at his broad ſide, and to run away to hell with it. God will kindle the fire of hell in the heart of him, wherein he ſhall find that hungry worm like the Devil, drawing at the heart of him, drawing-out the ſoul and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trals of him, like a few hungry glades riving at a guſhorn, thou ſhalt never have reſt henceforth, but an inward gnaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and rugging at the heart, till thou be fully poſſeſt in everlaſting flames. Gang thy way, <hi>man,</hi> if thou haſt
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:136247:25"/>
wronged the Cauſe of Chriſt for fear of thy life, I would not have an hour of thy life for all the gold of <hi>Gawry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly</hi>: This man loſeth his life another way more formally, as God upon this account for the man's ſeeking to ſave his life, garres his life gang upon a miſerable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, and that many times or long as the juſt reward of his ſin; he dyes in the midſt of his dayes, God garres him make ſome tykes teſtament, he doth not dye properly, he is cut-off in the midſt of his dayes, he diſownes God and betrayes the cauſe for fear of his life, ere ever he wit, God clieks him off. He had an honourable opportunity to have let his life go, but he would not let it go, ſo God garres him let it go upon a more miſerable account, and very readily God garres his life gang by that ſelf ſame mean that he took to ſave his life: it's like their eyes are open now that will ſee the like of that yet, now will ever we ſee that day that the <hi>Declaration,</hi> and the <hi>Service-book,</hi> and keeping <hi>dayes</hi> of mens invention, will be the high-way to garr ſome folk loſe their life. Will ye have patience a little? Ye ſhall either ſee that day, or ye ſhall ſay I had no skill of preaching, or of the mind of God, ye will ſee this, that thoſe folks that have betrayed the People of God, have moſt of all betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their own life, they think they have gotten a ſafe-gate for their life now, as ever man had, for they have made the <hi>King Head of the Church,</hi> and they ſhall be of any Religion that ever he likes to bring through the Land, that they may ſave their life. Goodſooth that will not workyet, all that will not bide you, that will even but bring you the ſooner to the gallows, that will garr your bones whiſtle in the wind ſome day. Will the taking of the <hi>Declaration</hi> do your turn, think ye? God will garr the taking of that Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, that many a man thinks to be the ſafety of his life, that way of the ſafety of his life will garr his head weigh his tail yet, and his bones whiſtle in the wind. All thoſe ſhifts will but the ſooner bring them to the gallows: ye muſt come to the gallows for theſe ſhifts that ye take againſt the Light of your own Conſcience. Ye will to the gallows, for all the plots that ye plot againſt the People of
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:136247:26"/>
God. Wicked <hi>Haman</hi> muſt to the gallows, for all the plot that he plots ſo deep againſt the People. Ye think that theſe lawes, that ye make againſt the People of God, will only bring them to diſtreſs, ſorrow, and bonds. Yea but they will garr your bones whiſtle in the wind, for all that. The readyeſt way to bring folk to a miſerable hinder-end, is, that wicked Declaration. What would ye think of ſuch a caſt of kindneſs from God's hand, as that to make your miſchief turn upon your own head? Wicked <hi>Haman's</hi> plots and contriving cruelty againſt the People of God moſt haſte to help him to haſte him to the gallows. <hi>Haman</hi> may make many decrees, but he muſt to the gallows, ere he ſee them put to execution. What would ye think, if thoſe lawes that they are making againſt the People of God, to bring them to ruin, bring their own carcaſes to the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows? Theſe their Acts and Lawes that they are making againſt the People of God, is the way in all the world to haſten themſelves to a miſerable hinder-end. The ſinfull way, that a man takes for the ſafety of his life, proves the very mean and way of his overthrow, and ſo will come of them yet.</p>
               <p>Now, what is the reaſon of this, that he, that ſeeks to ſave his life, ſhall come to a miſerable hinder-end that way that he ſeeks to ſave it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The reaſon is <hi>the righteouſneſs of God</hi>: God is a Righteous God, that is even the reaſon of it; God is a Righteous God, he will make it known to all the world that he is an Upright God, and that there is no unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs in him. He is righteous in this, to rain ſnares on ſuch wicked Soules, that lay ſnares before the conſciences of his People. The Righteous God loveth Righteouſneſs, as ye heard in the morning, upon the hinder-end of that <hi>Pſalme,</hi> that we lectur'd on; the way that the man went to ſave his life, when God called him to lay it down, he is a Righteous God to garr his life gang by that way which he looks to ſave it, the man that before Heaven and Earth, Sun and Moon, und the World, makes ſuch a choiſe, as God has forbidden to ſave his life; God is Righteous to
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:136247:26"/>
hold him at his choiſe, and that way to bring him to a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable hinder-end. I offer'd you life eternal, Peace of Conſcience, the way to ſave your life for ever, ye would not, but ye would have your ventur on a way of your own. Wel, as I live, ſaith God, I ſhall take you at your word, that choiſe ſhall you make, that ye have made, and that choiſe ſhall be your ruin, ye ſhall take the holding of your life in that choiſe, that ye have made; ye ſhall never get more of me, ye have no more to crave of me. Now, God is a Righteous God in this. Wel now, for the <hi>Uſe</hi> of the <hi>Doctrine,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt</hi> of all, Ye would labour to know with your ſelf, in what hazard your life is in, when the Cauſe of Chriſt is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſtage, ye would reckon with your ſelves, how many wayes ye may run the hazard of your life, when Chriſt's Cauſe is upon the ſtage, either by not doing and omitting that which ye ſhould do, or by committing and doing that which ye ſhould not do, it were not amiſs to conſider theſe hazards, and what the Scriptur ſpeaks of folks ſeeking to ſave their lives, any of theſe wayes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly</hi>: Do not hold up, nor ſatisfie your ſelves with any of your broken pretences, that I have named, or others, that I have not named, they hold no weight before God, ye muſt be even-down in the matter, for <hi>he that ſeeks</hi> any way <hi>to ſave his life, ſhall loſe it.</hi> Ye need not ſpeak of this, there is Law and Authority for ſuch a falſe cauſe; ye need not ſpeak of your proving your loyalty to your Prince, that way; ye need never pretend that ſuch a way ye thought beſt for peace; ye need never pretend your uſefulneſs to God's People, by your taking ſuch a gate; ye need never ſay, ye are keeping your life till a better time; ye need ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver tell us, ye had no ill intentions, or that your bare teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony would not have don good: theſe are fooles devices, <hi>he that ſeeks to ſave his life, ſhall loſe it.</hi> That word hath more weight, than all the fooliſh intentions and pretexts that ye have, <hi>he that ſeeks to ſave his life, ſhall loſe it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly</hi>: Let me obteſt you, as ye love your own life, as ye love the life of your Soul, and your natural life, as

God's bleſſing, and not as God's curſe, and as ye love the comfort of your life, and life it ſelf; then by all theſe I obteſt you to make a right choiſe: it is like ere long your life may come upon the ſtage for Chriſt and his Cauſe, and ye may get it in your option, to ſave or to loſe your life, with denial or not denial of the Cauſe. Now as ye love the life of your ſoules, and a bleſſing upon your natural life the comfort of your life, the keeping of your life, make a right choiſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly</hi>: Sirs, Never covet the life of thoſe that have keeped their life by wronging the Cauſe of Chriſt, covet not their life, I ſay, therefore. Have they not a brave life of it? God ſave me and all that I good would from a trial of it, for all that? will ye let alone, for all that, if ye had a trial of it, within a little ye would think it worſe than the moſt miſerable death that ever a man dyed. One dying not long ago may be exemplary for this, it's a brave teſtimony that he gave for this, lying on his death-bed, I <hi>would not</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>bide one night again, as</hi> I <hi>have had, for that Declaration, for all the World.</hi> When heard ye one of our ſide, that ever ſaid the like of that, for taking the <hi>Covenant,</hi> and abiding by it? God be thanked, we will get ſome of the other ſide, that will ſay ſo for taking of that <hi>Declaration,</hi> albeit they be ſcarce as yet, nevertheleſs I hope there ſhall be more of them, ere it be long. I ſay, covet not their life: black and miſerable is the life that ſome of them have of it, a fearfull looking for of the Soul to be rugged out of them, the <hi>worm that never dyes</hi> ay ſitting rugging at the heart of them, where the life ſits, the broad <hi>curſe</hi> of God upon their life and all that they gather together with their hands, as the work of their life, God's curſe upon all holding bed &amp; boord of them, &amp; it may be that make a ſad ſight to be ſeen of ſome of them and all that they have, what they are. That is a dreadfull thing, beſide the inward worm gnawing with terror, like a worm rugging at the mawe of them, ready to rugg-out the very miſerable life, that they would fain be quite of, which God ſhall within a little cauſe to gang in the favour of the Devil, in the midſt of their dayes. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:136247:29"/>
                  <hi>Sirs,</hi> covet not their life, they have a miſerable life of it; yet, <hi>Sirs,</hi> upon the other hand, ye muſt ever pitty poor folk in this caſe, for their tentation was even very great, as I was ſaying to you before, Now, that we may end this doctrin, obſerve here the righteous wiſdom of God in deſtroying mens lives, who for fear of perſonal ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard ſeek to ſave them, with prejudice to Chriſt and his Cauſe, who love their lives better than Chriſts Cauſe, &amp; ſo wrong it, for the ſafety of their life. Ye may ſee much of that now adayes, and if ye live long, ye will ſee more of it, there may be much of it ſeen already, if ye ſee a man falling into a ſnare, to enrich himſelf, as indeed ye will get hundreds not farr off, O then admire the <hi>Righteous Wisdom</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> in that ye ſee a man ſeeking to ſave his life, and falling into a miſchief by that, admire the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God in it, if ye ſee my complying with that wicked Party, for fear of their life, or for fear of their meanes, admire the righteous wiſdom of God in this, for making that a ſnare, for deſtroying of their life, which they made uſe of, for a mean to ſave their lives. </p>

               <p>YE have heard ſeveral reaſons of this <hi>inhibition</hi> ſerved upon this Truth in the mouth of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, which doth not warrand any man to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal this gracious Truth, unleſs they have a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory command for the doing of it, as the Diſciples here had. He did it as a Miniſter, not ſeeking his own glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, he did it as much pittying the Diſciples in their weak and unſettled condition, becauſe they could not wel main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that Truth before the <hi>Jewes</hi> and learned <hi>Rabbies,</hi> which Truth was controverted then, they being then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſettled, untill the <hi>Spirit was poured-out upon them from on high,</hi> that the <hi>Son of Man</hi> was riſen. He did it alſo as a
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:136247:30"/>
plague upon the <hi>Jewes,</hi> becauſe they abuſed this truth, therefore as a juſt puniſhment and recompence of their ſin, he layes on an arreſtment on the Truth, that they ſhould tell no man, <hi>that he was Jeſus the Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>Saviour of ſinners,</hi> the <hi>King, Prieſt, and Prophet of his People.</hi> He did it as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of the ſins of many for the accuſing of the Truth. But one of the greateſt Reaſons of this <hi>inhibition</hi> was to make way for another glorious deſigne, which was on foot in Heaven anent <hi>Chriſts ſuffering at Jeruſalem, for,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>if they had known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt knowing that he behooved to go to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and ſuffer, and to redeem the world, and ſo he ſets them at liberty to crucifie him, by their not knowing that he was <hi>the Lord of glory,</hi> and ſo he leaves them to a latitude to perſecut and crucifie him, that ſo he might accompliſh the great deſigne that his <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>He</hi> had on foot anent the <hi>Redemption</hi> of the World. And the Doctrin I ſhall here hold forth upon this Reaſon of the <hi>inhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition</hi> is this, <hi>that the Lord by the moſt uncouth and ſtrange Diſpenſation in his Church brings about the moſt glorious Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes and Works of God, that can be imagined in the world.</hi> There was no Diſpenſation almoſt that was more uncouth and more ſtrange, and more dark, &amp; more deſperate-like, than this was, <hi>Let no body know that I am the Chriſt, Let none know that I am the Saviour of the world,</hi> yet all was don by the burial of that Truth. The Lord Jeſus Chriſt brought about the moſt glorious work that ever was wrought for his Church, which was <hi>by the death of a ſtain Chriſt,</hi> which was occaſioned here ſome way by his hiding of this Truth from thoſe that were to crucifie him. I ſay, the Lord uſeth by the moſt ſtrange and uncouth diſpenſation in his Church, to bring about the moſt glorious purpoſes &amp; advantagious works for the good of his Church of any in the world. In following out this Doctrine, I ſhall ſpeak to theſe few things: <hi>Firſt,</hi> we ſhall ſpeak a little of ſtrange and uncouth diſpenſations, that fall-out in the Church, and then a word to what thoſe glorious works of God are, that are brought about by thoſe glorious diſpenſations. 3. We
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:136247:30"/>
ſhall give you ſome inſtances, by which it will appear that the Lord by the ſadeſt and uncoutheſt diſpenſations, that ever fell-out in the Church, has brought about the greateſt and moſt advantagious work for her. And in the cloſe of the Doctrine we ſhall ſpeak a word of Reaſon, why the Lord chuſeth this way, for bringing about ſuch glorious works and purpoſes by ſuch uncouth and ſtrange diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. For the <hi>Firſt,</hi> We call <hi>Diſpenſations</hi> uncouth and ſtrange and dreadfull-like, when things, as it were, fall out by a kind of <hi>ſpecial Providence,</hi> yet do juſtle with the revealed Word of God and his commands, ſuch as a lye put into the mouth of <hi>Jacob</hi> by <hi>Rebekkah,</hi> there was a kind of ſecret Providence in the thing that juſtled with the command of God, yet ye know there came ſome ſtrange ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to him thereby. So <hi>Eſther</hi> ye know came in the place of <hi>Vaſthi</hi> the Queen, this did exceedingly juſtle againſt the command of God, for the Jewes ſhould not have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred in marriage with any of that place that was not in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with God, this ſeemed to juſtle againſt the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God, yet ye know how this did amount to the good and advantage of the Kingdom of Chriſt. So the ſons of <hi>Jacob</hi> fell upon the <hi>Shechemites</hi>: that was an uncouth diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation, the poor man was juſtled exceedingly for that living among ſtrangers, yet there came a great advantage for <hi>Jacob</hi> out of that; <hi>Jacob</hi> had too long reſted in that neſt, therefore ſaith he, <hi>Ariſe Jacob, and go to Bethel.</hi> 2. We call <hi>Diſpenſations</hi> ſtrange and uncouth, as they juſtle with promiſes, predictions or prophecys of the Lord's great things towards his People; ye know he endeavoured for the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to bring them out of the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> it makes the burden ſeven-times worſe, their task is doubl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, this juſtled with God's promiſes or prophecyes of coming out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> a bonny beginning indeed, there is not one of them will come out of it, their task is doubled, yet by theſe things he brought about their delivery glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, for great advantage to them, and great ruin to their enemies. <hi>Hamans</hi> promotion with all his followers to the court of the King, it did directly juſtle againſt the oath that
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:136247:31"/>
he had ſworn he would have warr with <hi>Amalek</hi> for ever, <hi>Haman</hi> is ſo high, that he is like to overthrow all his <hi>Church</hi> and followers, that was an uncouth diſpenſation, yet his height overthrew him for evermore. 3. We call <hi>diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> uncouth, as they juſtle againſt the People of God, and as they difficult all the People of God, ſo as they cau not extricat themſelves out of that plunge, nor know what way to do it, theſe are uncouth and ſtrange diſpenſations. The People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in their march out of <hi>Egypt</hi> inſtead of liberty and freedom of march God ſtraitens them all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and the <hi>red Sea,</hi> with a rock on every hand, there was no eſcape there, that was an uncouth diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet that made way for a glorious out-gate for them and the utter overthrow of the enemy for ever. Yea ſaith <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> they are intangled in the land of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the wilderneſs hath ſhut them in, we have gotten you in an hoſe-net. Yea, <hi>goodman,</hi> crack at leiſur, it will be as good fiſhing you with an hoſe-net to morrow ere this time. 4. We call <hi>diſpenſations</hi> uncouth and ſtrange, as in themſelves they are deſtructive to the purpoſes and works he intends to bring about, as they are in themſelves deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive to theſe purpoſes, they are uncouth enough. Why are they not? As for example, the Lord buryeth a truth of great importance, lets men lay a great ſtone upon it, and ſay it ſhall never riſe again, then he brings up that truth again more glorious than ever. When he intends to make a truth famous on the earth, then he lets bury it; that is an uncouth and ſtrange providence and diſpenſation: this was the diſpenſation here mentioned in the Text, <hi>let no body know that I am the Chriſt;</hi> once ſaith he, bury that truth. I forbid you to tell any body that Truth. That's a ſtrange diſpenſation, it ſeems to be deſtructive to the whole Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace. Nay but bury it for all that, for I ſhall garr it riſe with a thouſand advantages more than ever yet; he hath a ſweet ſharp hand in theſe things, yes truely he has a ſellon gate to make contraries work for good. I confeſs it's a bare moor that he goes over, and gets nothing; that diſpenſation never fell-out in the Church, but he gets ay an
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:136247:31"/>
harle of it, for the good and advantage of the Church and People of God. I ſay then there are many uncouth and ſtrange diſpenſations, now ſome of them juſtling with commands, ſome with promiſes and predictions, ſome of them difficulting all the People of God, puting them all to their wits end, ſome of them of them ſelves deſtructive to the purpoſes he intends, yet by all thoſe he will bring about the moſt glorious purpoſes and works for the good of his Church in the world. This is the croſs wheel that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in a wheel, whoſe ſpoaks are dreadfull for height, and full of eyes; this is the wiſdom of God in his dealing with his Church going out of all mens ſight, whereby he intends to bring about glorious things for his Church.</p>
               <p>The <hi>ſecond</hi> thing we would ſpeak to, is, what are thoſe moſt glorious works and purpoſes of God for his Church, that he intends to bring-in by uncouth, diſpenſations. In a word, we mean by thoſe ſuch works and purpoſes as do mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter occaſion for the adminiſtration of the glorious attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes of God, whereby they may be gloriouſly ſeen for the good and advantage of the Church, ſuch works and purpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es as do manifeſtly bear ground to diſcover mercy to his friends, juſtice to his enemies, and God diſcovered thereby his glorious wiſdom, faithfulneſs, holyneſs and juſtice ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed both to friends and enemies; I mean theſe glorious works and purpoſes, that offer in them a diſcovery of the Attributes of God, an evident diſcovery of Mercy for his People, and an evident diſcovery of juſtice toward his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, thoſe are the <hi>glorious Works,</hi> that are brought about by <hi>ſtrange</hi> and <hi>uncouth diſpenſations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>third</hi> thing, I would here ſpeak a word to, is, to give ſome <hi>inſtances</hi> wherein ye may ſee the truth of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin many inſtances may be given in Scriptur, I ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them to theſe few <hi>Heads,</hi> 1. Take the diſpenſation or providence that was firſt managed in man's ſin, and is ſtill managed yet in man's tranſgreſſions, and ye ſhall find by the moſt uncouth and dread full-like diſpenſations the moſt glorious works of God fall-out for his Church: I ſhall mention but two Particulars in all that Head of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:136247:32"/>
the one was <hi>Adam's</hi> fall; <hi>Adam's</hi> fall was a moſt dreadfull diſpenſation, it juſtled exceedingly with the command of God, and with promiſes, and was deſtructive in it ſelf to his advantage, yet thereby the Lord brings about a better ſtate for Adam and his poſterity, than they were in before, thereby he did bring about admirable mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to his Friends, and admirable juſtice to his Enemies, which will be ſeen for admiration, to the world's end, and for evermore. 2. Conſider even in the ordinary falls of his People into ſin, theſe are uncouth <hi>diſpenſations,</hi> yet I hope ye will all grant that the Lord lets his People be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken thereby? that he may the more and the ſurer many times bind them up. It's true ye ſhould abominat every <hi>evil way,</hi> and <hi>ye may not ſin, that grace may abound,</hi> yet it's as true in this reſpect, I may ſay, <hi>that grace hath many times ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per abounded, when ſin hath abounded</hi>: the thing wherein it holds true, that <hi>uncouth</hi> and <hi>ſtrange diſpenſations</hi> bring about <hi>a moſt glorious work,</hi> which I ſhall inſtance was in that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation, which was managed in the Church of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhewn, to <hi>Egypt</hi> there was an uncouth diſpenſation falls-out, yet alwayes glorious: in end, of all <hi>Jacob's</hi> bairns <hi>Ioſeph</hi> was the beſt bairn of all the coupe, he was thinking on and dreaming of ſome things, and he is ay telling ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of them, for anger of that they'l take-away his life, yet, as it fell-out, they ſell him to the <hi>Egyptians</hi> into <hi>Egypt,</hi> where the dreamer and all his dreams now, quoth they? There is an uncouth diſpenſation, what ſhall become of the Kirk now, for the ſpecial man, that ſhould keep her alive, is ſold a ſlave? This was an uncouth diſpenſation, yet a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation moſt uſefull for the Church of any diſpenſation that could fall-out. Hold your tongues, ſaith <hi>Ioſeph</hi> to his brethren, <hi>God is wiſe enough</hi> in this, much ſhame and lack belongs to you for your ſelling of me, but God was wiſe enough for all that, he brought it about for good; and then ye know the uncouth diſpenſation that was triſted with the Church in <hi>Egypt,</hi> what ſad things they met with, before they went forth from it, that juſtled againſt both com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands prophecys, and predictions, after promiſed liberty
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:136247:32"/>
their bondage growes ay the longer the worſe, then they reſolve to ſlay all the <hi>male-children,</hi> but truely they never throve faſt till then there is an uncouth providence, the decree comes out to ſlay all the men children, but it's ſaid, <hi>the more they ſlew, the more they increaſed.</hi> Now but ye may think they had grown many of them, and they had not ſlain none of them in faith, ye are all miſtaken, there would never have been ſo many of them, <hi>the more they ſlew, the more they encreaſed,</hi> and that way God brought them to be above theſe lowns, wherein they were cruel, wel yet the diſpenſation grows ay the more and the more uncouth, the King grows ay angryer and angryer: angryer may he be, ſhame nor he burſt at the broad ſide for anger, but if his anger ſhould rive him all a bitts, they ſhall come out of <hi>Egypt</hi> that day, 400 years that they entred in, and ſo they did, ye would even be telling their things now, <hi>Sirs,</hi> to one another, and then ye know the ſad diſpenſation they were exerciſed with, after they went out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> before they came to the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> when the red ſea is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, and a rock on every hand, and <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and all his hoſt behind, this was the uncoutheſt diſpenſation of all, yet by it came the moſt glorious work of all, for then they were made fully and for ever quite of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and all his company, they were never troubled more with them, God ſets ay all his enemies once fair a foot on the field, he gives ay a good account of his enemies once in the field, and ſome to the ſword, but the next time they are ſought, they are not to be found. Ye need not think that theſe dayes are all away, in truth I think they are but even coming, yet many of them whenever God gives over good an account of the adverſaries of the Church, they had need to ſay their laſt prayers, for truely they are near a cloſe. Fra once <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and all his hoſt came out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> he had need to have faln to his laſt prayers with it, for he was near an end, and then ye know what difficulties they met with in the wilderneſs and in the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and yet all of theſe brought about a moſt glorious work, in end theirs are right brave wives tales, to tell about the fire-ſide at night: there was
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:136247:33"/>
another uncouth providence falls out in <hi>Davids</hi> time anent the three years famine that was upon the Church, that all the land was like to be ſtarved with hunger, many would think that was an unhappy diſpenſation, but truely it was one of the happyeſt diſpenſations that ever fell out in the Church, for were it not theſe years of famin, the dreadful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the breach of ſacred oaths to God had never been known, and then ye know what uncouth-like diſpenſations fall out upon the Church in <hi>Eſthers</hi> dayes, the enemies of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> there is all at a very great height, they having gotten authority on their ſide, they have all the People of God forehand hanged, for they had a Religion that other Folks knew not, this uncouth diſpenſation brought about the moſt glorious work imaginable for the overthrow of all the enemies of the Church. It's not believed what good God brings about for the Church by uncouth and ſtrange diſpenſations, that when the wicked ſpring as the graſs, and are as the green bay-tree, it is that they may be cut-off for ever. Brutish men know not this, that when the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed are brought to a great height, it is that they may be cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>off for ever, it's the fore-runner of the dreadfull vengeance of God upon them, when he raiſeth them to a great height, that it is that his vengeance may cut them off for ever, and then ye know the ſad things that befell the Church at <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> ye know what decrees came out there againſt thoſe that worſhipped <hi>the True God</hi>: if any man ſeek but a ſute from the <hi>King</hi> for ſo many dayes, he ſhall be caſt into the den of <hi>Lions</hi>; if any man worſhip not the image which <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> hath ſet-up, he ſhall be caſt into the firy fornace. This was a dreadfull diſpenſation, that theſe laws and decrees ſhould have been ſettled by the Kings of the Earth, againſt whom there was no riſing-up. Nay but there were as many bony decrees came out the back of theſe again, <hi>if any man ſpeak a word againſt the God of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, they ſhall be caſt into the Den of Lions, and a midden made of their houſes, they ſhall rot in the Earth; no God can ſave in the manner that this God can do.</hi> In truth I think, though one had ſworn it to you, if it had not been in the Book of
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:136247:33"/>
God, ye ſhould not have believed it, I doubt if ye believe it wel as it is. Bot believe this, if ye will, that uncouth and ſtrange diſpenſations bring about glorious works of God for the good of the Church, I know wel ye have many inſtances of it, the great part of the Bible clears it, and the Book will be believed by better than ever ſtood on your ſhinnes. The weakeſt turns that ever fell out in the Church that way, he made them ay the ſtrongeſt turns. I can not help it that ye will not believe it, but it's true enough.</p>
               <p>Bot next there is many inſtances of this under the New Teſtament alſo, for <hi>he is even that ſame God</hi> under the New Teſtament that he was under the Old. The <hi>Firſt</hi> great and remarkable thing, that fell out under the New Teſtament, was the deſtruction of Jeruſalem, and the abomination that makes deſolat, ſet-up in the midſt thereof. This was a dreadfull thing, the place of the publick worſhip of the Lord is all dung down and overthrown. Yea bot we are all obliged to God for that, for all that the Lord took oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion by that to build many a Kirk in theſe lands, the Lord ſet up a Chriſtian Church better than ever that was, he brought out a good turn out of that evil. And there was another remarkable thing fell out there at Jeruſalem, anent the Jewes perſecution at Jeruſalem, there is nothing then bot heading and hanging, drugging and drawing to priſons, all the twelve Apoſtles are put away, and there may be no more publick preaching, all the Apoſtles and miniſters muſt be baniſhed and put away, no man may ſpeak more in the Name of the Lord. In truth that was a canny gate that they took, for truth, for if they had ſitten ſeven years in a general aſſembly to have ſpread truth, and made it famous through the Earth, they took the ready way and the ſhorteſt cut, that was an happy luck that that <hi>Perſecution</hi> roſe, it would have been long ere our witt had brought it that way about, that way the Goſpel came to us, we were unworthy of it, bot God was good that gave us it for all that, it was even by that diſpenſation and the like, whereby God took occaſion to ſend the Goſpel over
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:136247:34"/>
to theſe <hi>Iſlands.</hi> Whenever God had a mind to make ſome Truth eminently glorious, then he let it ay fall into ſome Enemies hand to ſuppreſs and bury it, and by the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial of it he made it to riſe again, and be the moſt famous Truth upon the Earth. And the laſt tale I ſhall tell you about it, is this, and it is even the laſt that will be, and that is, <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> will even gather together to rout-out the Church, and then when they are all wel drawn up, and fair on the field, God will even make an end of all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and ſoon decide the controverſy that way; they will all gather up, and then God will even make an end of them. God haſten that day of their gathering together. For if they were all once wel gathered together, God will make us quite of them. So goodſooth ye wiil find the <hi>Pope</hi> and the <hi>Turk</hi> take even other by the hand, to drive one deſigne, the <hi>Pope</hi> and the <hi>Turk</hi> and <hi>Prelates</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignants</hi> will even all ſhake hands together, and draw up fair once in the field, for the ſwallowing-up of the Church, Lord haſten them all fair afoot on the field, that ſo the poor ſad People of God may ſee a good ſport in the down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come. For if they were once wel drawn-up, there ſhould be a ſudden down-come, God would make us quite of them, that gate. We muſt even wait-on a while, untill they draw better up; bot if they were all wel drawn-up, I aſſure you we would not need to wait long afterward.</p>
               <p>Now for Reaſon why the Lord takes ſuch uncouth diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations, to bring about his glorious Work and Purpoſes for the good of the Church, it is even for this, that he may diſcover the hearts of all men, much weakneſs in ſome, much wickedneſs in others; he lets poor ſilly weak things even bable on, and every one tell their own tale, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by diſcovers their weakneſs, and others, he gives them op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to vent the malice that is in their hearts, and thereby diſcovers their wickedneſs, <hi>a ſword ſhall pierce through manies hearts, that the hearts of many may be diſcloſed.</hi> He doth it alſo, that he himſelf may be the more ſeen in his glorious work for the Church, that no body may ſay they have a hand in that work, to aſcribe glory to themſelves,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:136247:34"/>
but that <hi>the Lord alone way be exalted.</hi> Now for <hi>Uſe</hi> of this <hi>Doctrin,</hi> I would have you all conſidering with your ſelves that there is now a junctur of ſtrange diſpenſations concurring together upon the Church at this time, as ever was upon the Kirk of God. Are not thoſe that ſhould feed the Lord's People with the Word of Life, ſold as ſlaves? of the People of God under bondage? the Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Lord all thrown down and deſolat? the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery thruſt-out, a number of them, and the reſt of them ready to be thruſt-away? unrighteous decrees multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing day after day? This is a clear thing to you all, the adverſaries of our Lord Jeſus and his Church are all at an eminency, and on foot, ſo that I dare ſay, the hearts of many of the Godly are at a ſtand, about what will become of all, there is ſuch a junctur of difficulties and dreadfull diſpenſations rolled over upon us.</p>
               <p>Now is there any of you that has a heart to believe in this caſe, that the reſult of this ſhall be the moſt glorious work for the good of the Church, that ever came about? Have ye an heart to believe this truth? I dare ſay ye want no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but an heart to believe it. Do ye believe this, that theſe uncouth diſpenſations ſhall bring about the moſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious works, that ever our eyes ſaw? This will be, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ye believe it or not. God never brought about ſuch an uncouth diſpenſation, but he brought about a moſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious work at the back of it. Chriſt Jeſus is, in a manner, now dead and buried: goodſooth his being buried will make him victorious over them all. The uncoutheſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation that ever was, brought ay about the moſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Work for the Church. No body has an heart to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve this. Has any of you an heart to believe this <hi>Doctrin.</hi> that the whole tenor of the Bible holds out that the Lord by uncouth diſpenſations brings ay about a moſt glorious work for the good of the Church? Have ye an heart to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve this? Has any of you that <hi>Charity</hi> to give God, that <hi>believes all things, and hopes all things, without which though a man would give all his goods to the poor, and his body to be burnt,</hi> it were an unacceptable ſacrifice. Ye muſt have
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:136247:35" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that charity, that bodes ay luck on God's hand, and thinks ay liberally of him. Have ye an heart to believe this, that the generation to come will have the Lord to bleſs, for <hi>ſtrange and uncouth Diſpenſations</hi>? Every generation yet had the Lord to bleſs, for the <hi>uncouth diſpenſations</hi> that were triſted with their fore-fathers Has any of you an heart to believe that the generation to come will have the Lord to bleſs, for theſe <hi>uncouth diſpenſations</hi> that now we are triſted with? The <hi>Truths</hi> of God are now buried, the <hi>Covenant</hi> is buried; that great Truth [that <hi>CHRIST is ſole HEAD of his CHURCH, and LORD over the CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SCIENCES of Men</hi>] is now buried. Now has any of you an heart to believe it, that the burial of the <hi>Covenant</hi> will be the reſurrection and glory of the <hi>Covenant</hi>? Has any of you an heart to believe this? It will be true enough, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it as ye will, that burial of the Covenant ſhall be the reſurrection and glory of the Covenant: it ſhall be ſeen, to their everlaſting ſhame, that it was an uncanny gate that they took for themſelves, to break the <hi>Covenant,</hi> that day they broke it, and burnt it at the Croſs of <hi>London.</hi> If they had ſitten ſeven years in a General Aſſembly, contriving how to make it a famous <hi>Covenant,</hi> they fell upon the right gate that day. Have ye an heart to believe this? It will be true, whether ye will believe it or not. The burial of the Covenant ſhall be the glory of the Covenant.</p>
               <p>Now this is a controverted Truth, that <hi>CHRIST is ſole HEAD and KING of his CHURCH, and LORD over the CONSCIENCES of Men</hi>; his <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Officers</hi> are reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the King's Laws and Officers are choſen. Now, has any of you an heart to believe this, that the burial of this Truth ſhall make it the moſt famous Truth on the Earth? The moſt glorious dayes of the Church of God are ay brought about by the moſt <hi>ſad</hi> and <hi>dark dayes.</hi> Therefore let us <hi>reſt in hope, and endure patiently.</hi>
