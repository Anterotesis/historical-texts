            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE actings of Providence are no leſs various than unſearchable, and it is both a pleaſant and pious Employment to obſerve and meditate on Gods miraculous proceedings with Mankind. For Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential Diſpenſations are diſcoveries of the Wiſdom and Goodneſs of God in diſpoſing of the conditions of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, whereby they may beſt glorifie him in whatever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falls them in this Temporal Life; becauſe a true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an

Though the gain be his, yet the loſs is ours; for when a good Prince dies, a general damp and conſternation ſeiſes the hearts of all Loyal Subjects, becauſe publick Calamity charges every Man with a rate of ſorrow proportionable to the tenure of his underſtanding; and the Memory of his late Majeſty may juſtly oblige all his People to an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of Tears as a ſignal of grief, and Your Lordſhip comes in as a Chief Mourner, who has had the Emanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his Royal Favour, which incourages my confidence to implore Your Lordſhips Patronage: whereunto if you will vouchſafe to give the leaſt approbation, I ſhall not deſpair of the more favourable Cenſures of others; and therefore it intreats Your Candid Interpretation and

The Bell ſtill toles for the voluptuous Epicure; and the Earth, that inſatiable Grave, longs for his corpulent Body to feaſt Worms. The ſwift motion of the Heavens roles up the thread of our Lives, and the fleet Horſe on which Death runs is ſtill poſting after us. Crowns nor Scepters can't ſecure from the Artillery of Death.

Conſider now the Day is far ſpent, the Night is haſtning and ſpreading its wings over us, the Grave expects us and bids other Corps make room. Death is ready to graſp us in its cold Arms, and hale us to the dreadful Tribunal, and yet how little of our great Work is done; we burn away our precious Days, and miſerably waſt our light and Life; we exhauſt our ſtrength, and laviſh out our affections on fond Toys and Nothings, ȧs if Eternity were to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected here, and none hereafter.

It is not Crowns Imperial, nor Thrones, nor Diadems, that can eſcape the great Aſſize. The laſt judgment is ſuch a day, as neither Wiſdom, nor Riches, nor Honours can deliver them from it.

The Jews likewiſe, who were of the greater and better ſort, had their Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chres in their Gardens, that in the midſt of their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures they might be mindful of Death, and to be unto them as monitors of their mortality: So while we are contriving our profits and pleaſures, our employments and recreations, and ſharing out our lives among them, let us not forget how eaſily we may be cut off by the ſudden and ſurpriſing ſtroaks of death. <hi>Fabius</hi> the Roman Senator was ſuffocated with a hair in a little milk.

Man is a compound of jarring qualities, heat, cold, drought and moiſture, which are always wageing an inteſtine war within him, ſo that poor mortals are ſubject to deſolation every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For the truth of this, let us ſearch the Records of the Grave, there lies the rich and the poor, the wiſe and the fooliſh, the learned and unlearned, the Noble and Ignoble, even the rubbiſh of a thouſand genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions heaped up one upon another. Our very Graves were once living, we dig through the veins of our Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers, and we muſt ſhortly become earth to bury our Poſterity, therefore let us learn the neceſſity of dying, for amongſt all Arts and Sciences whatſoever, there is none in compariſon, more beſeeming our Chriſtian care, than that which teaches us to live righteouſly and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly here, that afterwards we may live eternally when we depart hence, and be happy in the Regions of bliſs in the world to come. Life is a ſpot of time between two Eternities, and it is an act of the greateſt prudence to pray for Divine Arithmetick to number our days and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply our hearts to wiſdom, and contemplate with our ſelves of the uncertainty of life, that our hearts may be lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up to deſire the Heavenly inheritance.

            <p>O think what a Potent Oratory there is in Princely Clemency! Who would not be captivated by ſo ſweet a Conquerour? Who would not be melted in ſo delicate a Flame? What Heart would not entertain ſo pleaſant an Arrow? It ſtruck through the Hearts of all his Liege People; and they as faithful Subjects returned the ſtreams of Loyalty and Love, Duty and Obedience unto the Ocean whence it flow'd.

Some indeed owe their innocence to their dulneſs and ſtupidity, and are not vitious, becauſe not witty enough to be takingly and handſomly wicked; but here it is far otherwiſe, as will appear from the quickneſs of his Parts and Ingenuity, his Activity and Motion, Wiſdom and Prudence meeting in him, with all other Virtues and Excellencies mutually embracing each other. And the Endowments of his Mind will give it a clear illuſtration, his Apprehenſion was quick and pierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, his Memory faithful and retentive, his Fancy ſpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and active, and his Judgment over-ruling them all; neither prejudicated by vulgar Opinions, nor eaſily co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen'd

by varniſh'd and plauſible error.

Religion is the Pillar on which the great Fabrick of the Microcoſm ſtandeth, and all Humane Societies, and Civil Aſſociations, are united by this Holy Cement in the Bands of Concord, Unity, and Love.

putting on Righteouſneſs as a Garment, and Judgment like a Robe and a Diadem.

            <p n="1">1. His Piety. Religion is the fair Daughter of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, and that Immenſe Being has planted it in the Heart of Man, to direct us in our way to Heaven. It is the univerſal <hi>Patrimony</hi> which entitles us to be the Sons of God, and by which we are Adopted unto the aſſured Hope of Life and Immortality. It is the moſt Sacred Anchor which upholds Church and State; for without the knowledge and fear of a Deity, all things would run into diſorder and Confuſion; without an opinion of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to ſee and reckon with us, Might, Craft, and Falſhood would ſway alike with Men and Beaſts, and the Conſcience of good and Evil would be all one. Religion then is the <hi>Loadſtone</hi> with which when our Souls are once touched, they are directed to the right Pole of the beatifical Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and without which we muſt infallibly expect to ſplit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Rocks of Eternal Perdition; therefore this Pious Prince did think it the greateſt Character of his Glory to
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:99440:11"/>
be truly Religious towards God, and to preſerve the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Divine Majeſty in his own Soul, becauſe in a pure Conſcience Gods Face is to be ſeen, and no where elſe on Earth. It is the Mountain of Transfiguration where we may ſee the Kingdom of God. This is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Iſle <hi>Patmos</hi> where are the Viſions and Revelations of the Son of Man. It is the Garden God walks in. It is the Temple that the Holy Ghoſt dwells in, the Golden Pot, the hidden Manna is laid up in it. It is <hi>Gideon</hi>'s Fleece which all the Dew of Heaven falls on; for he that hath a pure Heart, and clear Hands, waſhed not in Water but Innocency, may with Holy <hi>David</hi> compaſs Gods Altar; their Walks are in a Wood dropping Honey, their Dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings on a Mountain of Myrrh, and Lodging on a Bed of Spices. We read in Holy Writ that the Sun and Moon ſpeak loud, their ſound is gone out into all the Earth; but yet a holy and virtuous Life ſpeaks louder,<note place="margin">Pſal. 19. 1.</note> the ſound of it is heard in Heaven, and cauſeth Joy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Angels. The ſound of it alſo goes out to the Earth, and fills the Mouths of Men with Gladneſs and Rejoycing. It is the manifeſtation of Grace and Vertue, which makes the Lord to be admired in them who fear him. This opens every ones Eyes, and cauſes all to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that God is in them of a Truth: practis'd Piety is the moſt perſwading Oratory to Piety and Godlineſs, and all Vertue. They who live in the unfruitful Works of Darkneſs diſhonour their Maker, it is only the Trees of<note place="margin">Iſal. 61. 8.</note> Righteouſneſs which Glorifie him: ſo ſaith our Saviour, <hi>Herein is my Father glorified,</hi> when you bring forth much<note place="margin">John 25 8.</note> Fruit.

Every Grace, and every Virtue of a Chriſtian, is a real Sermon to convince the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:99440:12"/>
World of its Impiety. The Pious Mans Devotions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute Atheiſtical Prophaneneſs. The Chaſt Mans Behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our teaches the wanton Modeſty, and the Sober Mans Carriage declaims againſt Exceſs, and beſpeaks Sobriety to the Intemperate. The Meek Mans Converſation preaches Mercy to the furious Ones, and ſo it is the pious manifeſtation of Grace and Virtue for which Men bleſs God, and the abundant Grace beſtowed on our late Gracious Soveraign, his admirable Courage, Piety, and Patience in the greateſt Agony of his Sufferings, and with earneſt Prayer and Supplication, deſiring the diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of his Earthly Tabernacle, ſpeaks him the moſt Chriſtian King, and that Sanctity and Piety as Fruit did grow on this Royal Tree. Theſe were the Principles of his Piety and Religion on which this Mighty Monarch ſerved God, with <hi>Faſting and Prayer</hi> (like <hi>Anna</hi> the Propheteſs) <hi>Night and Day in the Temple,</hi> and with Fear and Reverence worſhipped God in his Holy Sanctuary; therefore praiſe waiteth upon him in the Gate, for <hi>the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wiſdom, a good under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding have all they that do thereafter.</hi> For the knowledge of God is the Philoſophers Stone in Divinity, by it we may turn all events into Golden Advantages to our Souls. This is the Knowledge that ſpeeds our paſſage to Eternal Glory, that is the ſhorteſt cut to Immortal Happineſs; and the trueſt Honour is inveloped in this rich Mantle of Wiſdom, in that it appears God himſelf is the Grand Teacher thereof. Our Wiſe <hi>Solomon,</hi> as a prudent <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty</hi> under God, and a worthy Succeſſor of a Bleſſed Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſerved the God of his Father with a perfect Heart and a willing Mind, and performed all things in order <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording</hi>

               <hi>to the commandment of</hi> David <hi>the man of God.</hi> And 'tis alſo the commendation of his late Majeſty, as of<note place="margin">2 Chr. 35. 24.</note> other good Kings, <hi>Aſa, Jehoſaphat, Hezekiah</hi> and <hi>Joſiah,</hi> that they did that which was right in the Eyes of the

Lord, as did <hi>David</hi> their Father. Now as all <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> mourned for their good King <hi>Joſiah;</hi> ſhould not the tide of <hi>Englands</hi> ſorrow ſwell ſo high for <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi>'s <hi>Joſiah,</hi> King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, ſeeing the parallel conſideration is as full of Equity, and transforms us into <hi>Niobes,</hi> making our Heads Rivers of Waters, and our Eyes Fountains for continual Tears?</p>
            <p n="2">2. His Princely Goodneſs to all his People, is eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,</p>
            <p>Firſt, In the rare Chriſtian Grace of Humility: though he was the fountain of Honour, and advanced above o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ſhining like the Sun in the lower Firmament, bright with Rayes of Glory and Greatneſs; yet he did not ſoar on the wings of Pride and Ambition, either fondly to diſdain the meaneſt of his Subjects, or proud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to lord it over others: nor yet did the Greatneſs of Majeſty make him forget his Parentage or Mortality, or to derive his Pedigree from the Off-ſpring of Death: But this illuſtrious Prince as <hi>the Son of Wiſdom,</hi> and it <hi>is juſtified of her Children,</hi> did know he was caſt of the ſame Mould with thoſe of a lower Species; and though he did ſit as a God, in reſpect of Imperial Authority, yet he muſt die like Man, and reſt alſo in the Bed of Silence, and by neceſſary conſequence not neglect holy and ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous preparation for it. Thus may we diſcover his Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Piety by the Virgin-temper of Humility, walking in the Steps of his Bleſſed <hi>Saviour</hi> and <hi>Redeemer,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding him from his Cradle at <hi>Bethlehem</hi> to his Croſs at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> as a mirrour of Humility. And this Pious Prince, as a Noble Imitator of his Lord, followed the Grand Exemplar of the Chriſtian Religion, who bids us learn of him to be <hi>meek and lowly,</hi> therefore he was <hi>cloathed</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matt. 11. 29. 1 Pet. 5. 5. Jam. 4. 6.</note> 
               <hi>with Humility,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, and had it written in the Table of his Royal Heart, <hi>God reſiſteth the proud, but giveth grace to the Humble,</hi> which now is conſummated
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:99440:13"/>
with Glory; for he wants not the envied Crowns of this World, having exchanged the ſhadows of an Earthly Kingdom for one Eternal in the Heavens, wearing the Crown of Righteouſneſs and Perſeverance in a better World.</p>
            <p>Secondly, His admirable Patience or Long-ſuffering. In <hi>Long-ſuffering,</hi> ſayes one of the Ancients, the Lord <hi>doth inhabit.</hi> This ſublime Spirit indeed poſſeſſed the Royal Breaſt of his late Majeſty, which raiſed him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the ordinary Rank of Mankind in a truly Pious Patience under the greateſt Sufferings. His Chriſtian Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Compaſſionate Kindneſs, Tender-hearted Charity, and Pious Patience againſt all injuries, declare him not only one of the greateſt Worthies of the Engliſh Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but the <hi>Beſt of Kings,</hi> and ſhews that Religion and Vertue, as Fruit, did grow on this Royal Tree. We may without Sword or Fire become <hi>Martyrs,</hi> if we have Patience in our Hearts. For true Patience carries with it a ſingular property, that Satan hath not the power to attain ſo much as a ſhadow of it, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, he is always in Impatience; Patience is too beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for his deformed Nature and crooked diſpoſition, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a compoſition of all thoſe lovely Vertues and Graces of the Holy Spirit, to which he is a perfect ſtranger. To die by a Perſecutor, it s <hi>Martyrdom</hi> in open work; but to ſuffer injuries, and love our hater, it is <hi>Martyrdom</hi> in heart. Let Baptiſm be your Armour, Faith your Helmet, Love your Spear; but <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience Cap-a-pe,</hi> your whole Armour of defence, it is the ſweeteſt Salve to miſhap, or deſire of revenge, the trueſt Remedy of Injuries, and the Shield againſt Wrongs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, through <hi>Patience in well-doing, we ſeek for Glory and Honour, Life and Immortality.</hi> It is great Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, if being hurt, to forgive. It is great Glory if thou mighteſt puniſh, and yet to Pardon. This was
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:99440:13"/>
one of the Gemms in the Crown of his late Majeſty, that he exerciſed a Soveraignty over all his Subjects with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing and delightful kind of Patience, which does e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternize his Memory, and blazon his Honour to Poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, even his auſpicious and moſt gentle Government; and Chronicle will free me from the leaſt tincture of flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, if any think I am beyond the bounds either of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity or Truth. Now if the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the whole ſorrowful ſtructure of his <hi>Lamentations</hi> on the mournful Obſequies of the Good King <hi>Joſiah,</hi> ſhall not the Engliſh World weep out Elegies, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dole the Death of the Royal <hi>Charles,</hi> the <hi>light of our Eyes, and breath of our Noſtrils,</hi> of whom <hi>we ſaid, under his ſhadow we ſhall live among the Heathen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, His wonderful Beneficence or Chriſtian Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity diſplays it ſelf,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt.</hi> In forgiving his Enemies, when they had forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken their Allegiance by acts of Rebellion, and his late Majeſty could have cruſh'd them with the Hand of Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; yet he made an act of Indemnity or Oblivion the vehicle of his Kindneſs, which ſpeaks his Kingly Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, that he was a Patron of Goodneſs and Charity, and gives us occaſion to diſcern how tranſporting a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light it is to a Noble and Generous Mind, to be an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of good to others. As the bountiful light in the Body of the Sun, illuminates and beautifies all the Orbs, and Heavenly Bodies about it; by the projection of its beams, it begets all the Beauty, Glory, Sweetneſs, we have here below on the Earth, and it is ſo communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cative of doing good, as it never reſtrains the free Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of its Influence and Glory, until it determine by natural and neceſſary expiration: Even ſo proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onably his late Majeſty, as the Sun, did cheriſh and enli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Terreſtrial Bodies, and folded not up his Rays, but diſpenſed them freely, ſo that his Princely Clemency and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:99440:14"/>
Charitable Diſpoſition, like a rich Fountain, did run with large ſtreams of Goodneſs, which renders his Deceaſed Majeſty deſervedly honoured by all his Subjects; for all things that have an affinity with the Heavens, have a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municative Goodneſs, and move upon the Center of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other which they benefit; and Man may be, by ſo much, Neighbour to the Gods, by how much he doth good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond requital: for ſelf is a poor Center of a Mans actions; but to do good to others begets a ſtrong reflection of Majeſty and Honour. O that all thoſe who pretend to greatneſs of Mind would copy out this Munificence, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all Opportunities <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> to do good; for 'tis goodneſs which ſits gloriouſly Triumphant at the Top of Heaven, and uncharitableneſs lies miſerably grovelling under the bottom of Hell. Heaven deſcends from one as its principal Cauſe, Hell is built on the other as its main Foundation; as the one approximates the Bleſſed Angels to God, and beatifies them; ſo the other removeth the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Fiends to ſuch a diſtance from God and Happineſs (ſaith a Reverend Divine) not to wiſh, not to do any good. It is true Nobleneſs, and carrys with it the ſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of Majeſty and Greatneſs, Honour and Piety, to be of a large diffuſive Spirit, exerciſing Bounty and Mercy,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tom.</hi> 2.</note> as holy <hi>Athanaſius</hi> in his Works affirms, that Mercifulneſs is the Queen of Vertues; and his late Majeſty (whoſe Sacred Memory we celebrate) did practiſe this high piece of Chriſtian Perfection, according to the Preſcriptions of<note place="margin">Matt. 5. 41.</note> our Lord, in forgiving his Enemies: which ſhews that Goodneſs and Charity, as Fruit, did grow on this Royal Tree.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> His Kingly Munificence and Liberality, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the <hi>Tribe of Levi,</hi> but to all that implored his Royal Favour, diſpenſing of his Treaſures to the ſupply <hi>of the needy,</hi> and putting on <hi>Bowels of Mercy</hi> to thoſe in want and neceſſity, giving <hi>Bread</hi> to the <hi>Hungry,</hi> and <hi>cloathing</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:99440:14"/>
               <hi>the naked with a garment:</hi> And one Charitable Action (performed in Obedience to the Divine Command) will be more conducive to our Eternal Welfare, than the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of innumerable Worlds. Therefore this Pious Prince was inclined to acts of Beneficence and Compaſſion, who now injoys the happy conſequences thereof; for Bread caſt upon the Waters is <hi>trajectitia pecunia,</hi> Money, for which you take a Bill of Exchange from God, and it meets you in a far Country, no Robbers by Land, no Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies by Sea, no unfaithfulneſs of Factors, no violence of Tempeſts ſhall take it from you. He <hi>hath diſperſed, he hath given to the poor</hi> (ſaith the Pſalmiſt) <hi>and his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 112. 9.</note> 
               <hi>endureth for ever.</hi> And ſo Goodneſs and Charity did ſhine in this Mighty Monarch, like the precious Stones in <hi>Aarons</hi> Breaſt-Plate. There is no felicity now a want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (to this illuſtrious Monarch) but that of <hi>Virginius Ruffus,</hi> to have another <hi>Tacitus</hi> to write his Funeral Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequies, thoſe juſt Encomiums and Praiſes due to his rare and ſingular Perfections; for Vertues are Copies drawn for imitation, and left as paths for ſucceeding Ages to tread in:
<q>
                  <l>Regis ad Exemplum totus componitur Orbis.</l>
               </q>
And his late Majeſty being Dead, yet ſpeaks by his Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Example to all his loving Subjects, in the Language of the Holy Apoſtle, <hi>Be ye followers of me, as I was of Chriſt,</hi> in Faith and Hope, Humility and Meekneſs, Charity and Patience, till you come <hi>ad interior a velaminis,</hi> above the reach of dull Mortality, filling up thoſe ſeats of Bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and triumphing in the Glories of a <hi>Saviour.</hi> Death, however we figure it with the Pencil of Fancy, yet it does but rend the vail of Mortality, and lets the Soul into the Palace of ineſtimable Majeſty, where we ſhall not only behold <hi>Jeſus</hi> in all his Glory, but receive the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt effects of his mighty Love, and live with him for
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:99440:15"/>
ever in Heavenly Places. The quality of the Grave is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd ſince Chriſt ſlept there; it was a Priſon, now a Chamber of repoſe. The Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> ſpeaking of the<note place="margin">Iſai. 57. 2.</note> Death of the faithful, ſaith, <hi>They ſhall enter into peace, they ſhall reſt in their beds,</hi> for Death of a formidable Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my is made a Friend, and a Bleſſing in Chriſt, a paſſage from the Valley of Tears to the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of Glory. Now who would be afraid to be Happy? Indeed were our Tombs the Everlaſting Repoſitories of our moulded A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes, and the Grave a ſad Cloſet of Eternal Sleep, a Man had ſome reaſon to tremble at the apprehenſions of Death; and ſince the Day cannot ariſe but through the ſhadows of the Night, and there is no tranſition to Heaven and Eternal Life but through the Chambers of a Temporal Death, we ſhould be content to go that way to Glory, that our Saviour went before. Venerable <hi>Job,</hi> under the ſad Tragedy of Miſery, with a Triumphant kind of Joy,<note place="margin">Job 19. 25, 26, 27.</note> laid up in his Boſome this joyful expectation, <hi>I know my Redeemer liveth, and though Worms deſtroy this Body, yet in my Fleſh ſhall I ſee God.</hi> The ſame individual Bodies<note place="margin">Joh. 5. 28.</note> that died will be raiſed, <hi>Marvel not at this, for the hour is coming in the which all that are in the Grave ſhall hear</hi>

               <hi>his voice, and come forth.</hi> And the Reſurrection of our Bodies is aſſured by Chriſts Teſtimony, the veracity of<note place="margin">Acts 10. 38, 39, 40, 41. 1 Cor. 15. 20.</note> Chriſt is witneſſed by his Reſurrection, for <hi>Chriſt is the firſt-fruits of them that ſleep.</hi> As the firſt Fruits are a ſure demonſtration and evidence of the near approach and drawing on of the Harveſt, ſo the Reſurrection of Chriſt is a ſure ground of hope and comfort for aſſuring us, that<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 14, 15.</note> all thoſe who dye <hi>Christs Diſciples,</hi> ſhall riſe to a Bleſſed Immortality. He ſhall make us partakers of his Glory, and bring us into thoſe everlaſting Habitations, where dwells an undiſturbed Peace, where neither Diſeaſes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach the Body, nor Vices have acceſs unto the Mind, where ſhall be life without fear of Death, and Joys with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

mixture of Sorrow. In the Primitive Times, at Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, they were wont to ſing Pſalms of Thankſgiving. The <gap reason="foreign">

What cauſe is there now of Sorrow or Lamentation? but rather of Joy and Gladneſs: when we conſider Deaths Errand, it is our convoy to Heaven, the dawning of an Eternal Day, and Eve of a Glorious Feſtival, the way wherein we muſt walk to Happineſs If old <hi>Jacob,</hi> when he ſaw the Chariots come from <hi>Aegypt,</hi> his Heart did leap within him, becauſe he ſhould ſee his Son <hi>Joſeph:</hi> We may ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine what a comfort it will be in the beatifical Viſion, when <hi>Adam</hi> ſhall ſee all his Grand-Children the Sons of <hi>Enos</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; <hi>Abraham</hi> his faithful Seed; <hi>Moſes</hi> his true <hi>Iſrael<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites; Aaron</hi> his Spiritual Poſterity; <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi> ſhall ſee his Penitents; <hi>Peter</hi> his Converts; <hi>Paul</hi> his Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; the Angels ſhall ſee all their Wards; God all his Sons; Chriſt all his Members What a glorious appeaing will there be?

O that this confide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration might have its proper operation in the Hearts and Minds of all, ſo as to fear God and practiſe Religion, that we may obtain a Glorious Reward; for all Ornaments and Excellencies, whether of Art, Nature, or Policy, are but a dead thing, unleſs they be animated and quickned with the power of Religion and fear of God: therefore whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we aim at a Temporal or Spiritual good, Religion is
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:99440:16"/>
mainly to be magnified. Many Bleſſings belong to the Religious which they enjoy in this Life. The Riches of Grace are poured on them, and the Word of Life is preach'd unto them; their Thoughts are Heavenly, and Hearts the Throne of the Holy Ghoſt; their Tongues talk of the Praiſes of the Almighty, and their Feet ſtand in the Temple of the Lord; their Prayers are like Incenſe, and the lifting up of their Hands as an Evening Sacrifice; Who will not now become Religious? to wear a Crown that never ſhall have an end after Death, to have Angels their Companions, and Saints their Fellows, Heaven their dwelling Place, and Pleaſures of Paradiſe the recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of their Reward. If ſumptuous and ſtately Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings do delight, what Habitation is ſo Magnificent and Glorious as the New <hi>Jeruſalem?</hi> If Riches, what ſo Rich as that, whoſe Foundation and Wall are of Precious Stones, and Gates of Orient Pearls? If Honour, what Honour comparable to this, to be Servants of the Moſt High, the Sons of ſo mighty a King, and Heirs of ſo Glorious a Kingdom; where neither the Teeth of Time can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, nor Rancor of Envy deprive of Honour, nor Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Adverſary ſpoil its Glory, being endleſs and Incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible. There is no ſuch gain as trading to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, to be Merchant Adventurers for Happineſs, all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things are nothing; let this ſo raiſe your apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions as your Lives may be an Argument to prove it: for if we do expect Salvation, Mercy and Glory, at the Hands of the Almighty, we muſt be active in well doing, Obedient to his Laws, Confident in his Promiſes, and Religious in his Service, that ſo being followers of the Bleſſed Saints, who are departed out of this Life in the Faith of Chriſt, directing our Lives after their Good Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, and particularly of this Pious Prince, who has changed the Terreſtrial Paradiſe of all his Kingdoms, to be partaker of a Celeſtial One, which is beyond the

            <p>NOW after the dayes of Mourning in <hi>England</hi> for the Death of <hi>Britain</hi>'s <hi>Joſiah,</hi> the Great and Good King <hi>James</hi> the Second hath given us a day of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing in the peaceable Acceſſion to the Imperial Throne of theſe Kingdoms, which hath been long and happily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed by his Royal Anceſtors, and by an unqueſtionable Right and lineal Succeſſion deſcends on his Sacred Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty. We have great cauſe to rejoyce, when we conſider our happineſs, that it hath pleaſed the Almighty God to give us for our King a Prince of the ſame Blood, Son of <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Martyr,</hi> and Brother to <hi>Charles</hi> the Good and Great: and His Sacred Majeſty has attained the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of <hi>James the Just,</hi> who is not only an Inheritor of the Crowns of his Royal Progenitors in all the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs and Glories of a Coronation, but of their Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues.

And with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual Gratitude and hearts full of Duty and Allegiance, we pay the Tribute of Thanks to his Sacred Majeſty, for his moſt Indulgent Declaration, that he will take our Lives, Liberties and Religion into his immediate Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection; and the inviolable Steddineſs of his Royal Word is that on which we rely with an intire Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, for the Support and Enjoyment of our Eſtabliſht Religion; a Religion, that has been (as his Majeſty gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly obſerves) and ever will be for the Maintenance of Monarchy. And as our Church is the Rule to us of a pure and unſpotted Loyalty, ſo it is not poſſible we ſhould loſe the one, ſince his moſt Illuſtrious Majeſty is ſo graciouſly pleas'd to preſerve the other. And what can we deſire more on this ſide Heaven, than that we live under his auſpicious Reign, ſafe in our Religion and Properties. What bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter pledges could we have asked for them, than what we have; his Sacred Word, which hath made us intirely ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure; and hath left us nothing now to wiſh or pray for, ſave only that it would pleaſe Almighty God by a merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and over ruling Providence to defeat the Malice, and to fruſtrate and diſappoint all the Conſpiracies of his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies. And we humbly beſeech the Great God, the King of Kings, to preſerve his Sacred Majeſty in Health and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, to proſper all his Affairs at home and abroad, and make all his Subjects truly Loyal and Obedient, and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh his Royal Throne many and many Years, that he may long and happily Reign over us to the utmoſt period of Humane Nature; and when the Crown ſhall ſlide from his Sacred Temples, be at laſt tranſlated to an Eternal Throne of Glory.</p>
