            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>The Catholick Ballad: Or an Invitation to Popery.</head>
                  <opener>To the Tune of 88.</opener>
                  <l>SInce <hi>Pop'ry</hi> of late is so much in debate,</l>
                  <l>And great strivings have been to restore it,</l>
                  <l>I cannot forbear openly to declare,</l>
                  <l>That the Ballad-makers are for it.</l>
                  <l>We'l dispute no more then, these <hi>Heretical men</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>Have exposed our Books unto laughter,</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="13" facs="tcp:57484:9"/>So that many do say, 'twill be the best way</l>
                  <l>To sing for the Cause hereafter.</l>
                  <l>O the <hi>Catholick Cause!</hi> now assist me my Muse,</l>
                  <l>How earnestly do I desire thee!</l>
                  <l>Neither will I pray to St. <hi>Bridget</hi> to day,</l>
                  <l>But only to thee to inspire me.</l>
                  <l>Whence should Purity come, but from Catholick <hi>Rome?</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>I wonder much at your folly?</l>
                  <l>For Saint <hi>Peter</hi> was there, and left an old Chair,</l>
                  <l>Enough to make all the World holy.</l>
                  <l>For this Sacred old Wood is so excellent good,</l>
                  <l>If our Doctors may be believed,</l>
                  <l>That whoever sits there needs never more fear</l>
                  <l>The danger of being deceived.</l>
                  <l>If the Devil himself should (God bless us) get up</l>
                  <l>Though his Nature we know to be evil,</l>
                  <l>Yet whilst he sat there, as divers will swear,</l>
                  <l>He would be an infallible Devil.</l>
                  <l>Now who sits in this Seat, but our Father the Pope?</l>
                  <l>Which is a plain demonstration,</l>
                  <l>As clear as Noon-day, we are in the right way,</l>
                  <l>And all others are doom'd to damnation.</l>
                  <l>If this will not suffice, yet to open your eyes,</l>
                  <l>Which are blinded with bad Education;</l>
                  <l>We have Arguments plenty, and Miracles twenty,</l>
                  <l>Enow to convince a whole Nation.</l>
                  <l>If you give but good heed, you shall see the Host bleed,</l>
                  <l>Aud if any thing can perswade ye,</l>
                  <l>An Image shall speak, or at least it shall squeak</l>
                  <l>In the Honour of our Lady.</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="14" facs="tcp:57484:10"/>You shall see without doubt the Devil cast out,</l>
                  <l>As of old by <hi>Erra Pater;</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>He shall skip about and tear like a dancing Bear,</l>
                  <l>When he feels the Holy Water.</l>
                  <l>If yet doubtful you are, we have Relicks most rare,</l>
                  <l>We can shew you the Sacred Manger;</l>
                  <l>Several loads of the Cross as good as ere was</l>
                  <l>To preserve your Souls from danger.</l>
                  <l>Should I tell you of all, it would move a stone-wall,</l>
                  <l>But I spare you a little for pity,</l>
                  <l>That each one may prepare, and rub up his ear,</l>
                  <l>For the second part of my Ditty.</l>
                  <l>Now listen again to those things that remain,</l>
                  <l>They are matters of weight, I assure you,</l>
                  <l>And the first thing I say, throw your Bibles away,</l>
                  <l>'Tis impossible else for to cure you.</l>
                  <l>O that pestilent Book! never on it more look,</l>
                  <l>I wish I could sing it out louder:</l>
                  <l>It has done men more harm, I dare boldly affirm</l>
                  <l>Than th' Invention of Guns &amp; Powder.</l>
                  <l>As for matters of Faith, believe what the Church saith,</l>
                  <l>But for Scripture, leave that to the Learned;</l>
                  <l>For these are edge-tools, &amp; you Laymen are fools,</l>
                  <l>If you touch them you are sure to be harmed.</l>
                  <l>But pray what is it for, that you make all this stir?</l>
                  <l>You must read, you must hear, and be learned:</l>
                  <l>If you'l be on our part, we will teach you an Art,</l>
                  <l>That you need not be so much concerned.</l>
                  <l>Be the Churches good Son, and your work is half done,</l>
                  <l>After that you may do your own pleasure:</l>

                     <pb n="15" facs="tcp:57484:10"/>If your Beads you can tell, and say <hi>Ave Mary</hi> well,</l>
                  <l>Never doubt of the Heavenly Treasure.</l>
                  <l>For the <hi>Pope</hi> keeps the Keys, and can do what he please,</l>
                  <l>And without all peradventure,</l>
                  <l>If you cannot at the fore, yet at the back-door</l>
                  <l>Of Indulgence you may enter.</l>
                  <l>But first by the way, you must make a short stay</l>
                  <l>At a place called Purgatory,</l>
                  <l>Which the Learned us tell, in the buildings of Hell,</l>
                  <l>Is about the middlemost story.</l>
                  <l>'Tis a monstrous hot place, and a mark of disgrace,</l>
                  <l>In the torment on't long to endure:</l>
                  <l>None are kept there but Fools &amp; poor pitiful Souls,</l>
                  <l>Who can no ready money procure.</l>
                  <l>For a handsom round Sum you may quickly be gon,</l>
                  <l>For the Church has wisely ordaind,</l>
                  <l>That they who build Crosses and pay well for Masses,</l>
                  <l>Should not there be too long detaind.</l>
                  <l>So that's a plain case, as the Nose on ones Face,</l>
                  <l>We are in the surest condition,</l>
                  <l>And none but poor Fools and some niggardly Owls,</l>
                  <l>Need fall into utter perdition.</l>
                  <l>What aileth you then, O ye great and rich men,</l>
                  <l>That you will not hearken to reason,</l>
                  <l>Since as long as y' have Pence, y' need scruple no offence,</l>
                  <l>Be it Murther, Adultery, Treason.</l>
                  <l>And ye sweet-natur'd Women, who hold all things common,</l>
                  <l>My addresses to you are most hearty,</l>
                  <l>And to give you your due, you are to us most true,</l>
                  <l>And we hope we shall gain the whole party.</l>

                  <l>To confess before you go to it.</l>
                  <l>There is one reason yet, which I cannot omit,</l>

                  <l>What benefits hence may be gain'd.</l>
                  <l>For the Pope shall us bless (that's no small happiness)</l>
                  <l>And again we shall see restored</l>
                  <l>The <hi>Italian Trade,</hi> which formerly made</l>

                  <l>Though Older they be, perhaps far than she,</l>

                  <l>Our Faith is so great, so sound and compleat,</l>
                  <l>It scorneth both Scripture and Reason;</l>
                  <l>And builds on Tradition, sometimes Superstition,</l>
                  <l>And oft-times Rebellion and Treason.</l>
                  <l>Our strict Purity, is plain to each eye,</l>
