            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>ARMORY, or Coats of <hi>Arms,</hi> ſaith Monſieur <hi>Ulſon,</hi> is no other than the Seal or viſible Character of <hi>Nobility,</hi> which is the moſt glorious recompence that either our own Virtues, or that of our Predeceſſors could acquire us. And as a Chriſtian ought not to be ignorant of his <hi>Chriſtian name,</hi> ſeeing it is the mark of his Adoption; ſo ſhould it be ſhameful for a <hi>Gentleman</hi> to be ignorant of his own Coat of Arms, being the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ſign of his Nobility and ſhortned Symbols of his Heroical Actions, or thoſe of his <hi>Predeceſſors</hi>: And in the general ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as Enſigns of Honour among Military men, have been as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently uſed in this Realm, as in any other; for neceſſity bred the uſe of them in Military affairs, for <hi>Order</hi> and diſtinction both of Political Bodies, Military and Civil, and for particular perſons, as notes of Honour; as may be gathered from the Sacred Scriptures on the party colour'd Coat of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> who had that honourable diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and from thence was called the Trophy-bearer, and the <hi>Abſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conditorum repertor,</hi> The Blazoner of Symbolical matter; as alſo that from <hi>Numb.</hi> 2. wherein every <hi>Tribe</hi> was commanded to pitch his Tent under their <hi>Standard, and under the Arms of his Father's Houſe.</hi> And not only the <hi>Armilogie</hi> of this <hi>Heroic Science</hi> was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, but the <hi>Gamilogie</hi> and preſervations of their Families by <hi>Genealogies,</hi> as may be gathered from the ſecond Chapter of <hi>Ezra,</hi> where thoſe that ſought out their Genealogies, among thoſe that were reckoned by Genealogy, but being not found were as pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, caſt from the Prieſthood.

The fifth is the <hi>Pale,</hi> repreſenting a Military man in a ſtanding Poſture, and is called a <hi>Pale,</hi> denoting Vigilancy and Diligence; and is as a Column or Pillar erected to the memory of deſerving Men. The ſixth is a <hi>Cheveron,</hi> and denoteth an Eſtabliſh'd Houſe, one that doth enjoy the <hi>Spolia Opima,</hi> the ſpoils of Arms gained in Wars: Honour being a Spur to Virtue, having attained to <hi>Opimum,</hi> which is all one with <hi>Amplum,</hi> and hath now ſet up the top Rafters of his Houſe.

The ſecond is parted per Chief indented, <hi>Argent</hi> and <hi>Sable</hi>; repreſenting Conſtancy and Divine Doctrine. The third is parted per Pale <hi>Argent</hi> and <hi>Gules</hi>; and ſignifieth Bold in all honeſt Enterprizes. The fourth is parted per Bend, <hi>Azure</hi> and <hi>Or</hi>; which repreſenteth in Moral Virtues, a Soldier of the Holy Court, given to divine Contemplation, and vigilant in Service.

Second, <hi>Rampant</hi>; Magnanimous, Noble. Third, <hi>Paſſant</hi>; Reſolute. Fourth, <hi>Paſsant-Gardant</hi>; Prudent. Fifth, <hi>Saliant</hi>; Valiant. Sixth, <hi>Sejant</hi>; Adviſed.

And becauſe Man, as he is the Head of the whole Creation, ſo to bear the Head of any Thing, is accounted the moſt Honourable; and what is gained with more Labour and Sweat to be preferred. As the <hi>Eraſed</hi> Head is more of Military Power than the <hi>Couped</hi>; the one being <hi>Torn</hi> off, and the other <hi>Cut</hi> off: So now to ſpeak of <hi>Heraldry,</hi> it is no other than that part of Hiſtory that conſiſts of <hi>Succeſſion</hi> in States, Countries, or Families, and Profeſſions, as the Lives of famous Men in any Faculty; For as the Emperor ſaith, We do not count that they only war, for our Empire, which do labour with the Sword and Shield; but alſo our Advocates: For though Councellors are not actual Warriors, yet they are repreſentative Warriors. And this noble Science is the ſame of <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> which is a commemoration of Things paſt, with the Circumſtances of Time and Place in diſtinct diſtances by ſmall Deſcents to revive the Dead, and to the Encouragement of the Surviving. <hi>Cantons</hi> have place among <hi>Augmentations,</hi> as in the Inſtitution of Baronets each wearing an <hi>Eſcocheon</hi> or <hi>Canton,</hi> charged with a <hi>Siniſter</hi> hand <hi>Gules,</hi> and when one <hi>Eſcocheon</hi> is born on another, it ſignifieth the Husband hath Married an Heireſs general, and having Iſſue by her, it is Quartered by the Son, to ſhew the right of her Inheritance is tranſmitted from her to him; But if ſhe be not an Heir, he may but impale the Coat on the <hi>Siniſter</hi> ſide, which is called Baron and Fem; as for the outward Ornaments of <hi>Mantles, Helmets</hi> and <hi>Creſts,</hi> with which the Coats were called altogether <hi>Atchievments,</hi> they were of Military and Civil uſe; The <hi>Mantles</hi> as the Tent, Cloak, or Surcoat over all.</p>
