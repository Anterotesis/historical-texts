            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

peril, and not to dread the least.) Some
Passengers that accidentally intervened,
boulted out the fresh Tragical Intelligence
of the destruction of the <hi>Galileans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the Novel (and for ought I find)
single conjecture of <hi>Maldonate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is more credibly and generally assert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that some of Christs set Auditors here,
took the hint, and mentioned the <hi>Galileans,
whose blood Pilate had mingled with their
Sacrifices;</hi> as if a singular impiety had ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
them liable to this singular cruelty;
as if God had cull'd them out for vessels
of his indignation to be poured into; as if
he had set them for Brands of an unparal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel'd
unremitted guilt.</p>
            <p>Our humane corrupt Nature is no less
prone to impeach, to doom wickedness at
distance, than to espouse, embrace it at
hand.</p>
            <p>Christ, the true Oracle, teacheth the <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi>
better Divinity, not to usurp Gods
Throne of Judicature, to pass Sentence of
Condemnation upon others, but to erect a
Tribunal in their own bosome, to arraign
themselves.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:49559:4"/>
Christ reproveth their erroneous senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
touching the <hi>Galileans,</hi> embrued in
their own Oblations (the Offerer being
become the Offering.) And touching the
Eighteen persons, shivered to their first
Principles, by the sudden demolition of the
Tower of <hi>Siloam.</hi> As for both, the esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,
the measure of their vices is not to be
taken by their calamities.</p>
            <q>I tell you, Nay; but except you repent, you
shall all likewise perish.</q>
            <p>The Text is chequer'd with Clemency
and Severity; it blunts the edge without,
to restrain our censure; and sharpens it
within, to excite our repentance.</p>
            <p>It is a Pillar of Cloud by day, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrap
the offences of others in an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure
concealment; it is a Pillar of Fire by
night, for the discovery of our own, to
enlighten our judgments, to enflame our
zeal: not to be Satyrists, Criticks; but Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitents,
Converts.</p>
            <p>The Text is twice recited within the
compass of five verses; it is a reiterated
smart admonition, the same sacred adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisement
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49559:5"/>
upon a double dysaster; the one
permitted by God, executed by <hi>Pilate;</hi> the
other hath the aspect of a more immediate
stroke of the Divine Justice.</p>
            <p>The Text brancheth it self to two Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions.</p>
            <p>The one negative, implicite, wrapt up;
<hi>I tell you, Nay.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The other, positive, explicite, unfolded;
<hi>Except you repent, you shall all likewise
perish.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The first may be thus unvailed.</p>
            <p>Neither the <hi>Galileans</hi> slaughtered amidst
their Sacrifices, nor those Eighteen Persons
crush'd at the Tower <hi>Siloam,</hi> were greater
Transgressors, than the other <hi>Israelites.</hi> It

            </p>
            <p>The Proposition admits a double sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigh,
Historical, and Doctrinal.</p>
            <p>In our Historical consideration, there is
an harmony among Expositors touching
those that perish'd at the Tower of <hi>Siloam.</hi>
A Narration scarce any where else ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant

in Sacred or Prophane Records.</p>
            <p>Touching the former Calamity (that of
the <hi>Galileans</hi>) there hath been started varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Opinions.</p>
            <p>Some gloss the Title <hi>Galileans</hi> to be a
disguise for <hi>Samaritans; Galilee</hi> (being out
of the Verge of <hi>Pilat</hi>'s Jurisdiction.) St. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril</hi>
of <hi>Alexandrina,</hi> and others in his Track,
unmasque the <hi>Galileans</hi> to be the Disciples
of <hi>Judas</hi> the <hi>Gaulonite,</hi> a grand turbulent
Incendiary, who had trained his Scholars
in a Lecture of the blackest grain of Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
(<hi>Nigriani</hi> in the primitive style) who
instructed them to withdraw their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
from the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire,<note place="margin">Nec Nigri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ani, nec Cassi ani. <hi>Tertul.</hi>
               </note> and their
intercession for the Emperour. Whereof
<hi>Pilate</hi> being certified, surprised, massacred
these <hi>Galileans,</hi> as they were celebrating
their Sacrifices.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Samaritans</hi> they might be for Climate,
for extraction; and yet denominated <hi>Gali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans</hi>
for their Sect, for their Tutor.</p>
            <p>There is a third Relation of a famous, or
rather infamous Magician of <hi>Galilee,</hi> who,
in the notion of a <hi>Messiah,</hi> had incouraged
multitudes (saith <hi>Aegesippus</hi>) conducted
them to Mount <hi>Ge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

would thence ascend to Heaven. Which
Imposture, <hi>Pilate</hi> blasted in the bud, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed
their blasphemy, not by the Tongue
or Pen, but by the Sword.</p>
            <p>To decline the Historical view of the
Proposition, the Doctrinal may be thus dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played.</p>
            <p>The greatest pressures, the sharpest mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series,
the saddest periods of this Life, are

the greatest sinners.</p>
            <p>The Clouds distil their soft dew, pour
down their fertil showers; the Sun darts its
warm beams, its benign influences to all
sorts of men.</p>
            <p>God freely communicates secular bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings

            <p>Not to pursue this Meditation too far:
It will become us to be nicely critical, to

Which casts me on the Tasque in my
Text.</p>
            <q>Except ye repent.</q>
            <p>Though <hi>Origen,</hi> in too wide a candor,
hath extended repentance to the damned
Spirits; yet others have confined it to too
narrow bounds: the <hi>Montanists</hi> not admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
it to those that offend after Baptism;
the <hi>Novatians</hi> not allowing it to a recidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of transgression, to a relapse, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
of guilt.</p>
            <p>Happy it is for us, that the Book of Life
of a merciful God, is not subject to the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zures
of opinionated men.</p>
            <p>That the Keys of Heaven are not within
the restraint of Heresies or Sects on earth.
The experience of all Ages manifests, that
where Truth hath been deserted, Charity
hath been discarded also. The Divine Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
commiserating humane frailties, hath
ordained repentance to be a continual Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick
for a continual malady, a reiterated Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine,
for a reiterated wound.</p>
            <p>A Cure that exacts not so much the
Lamp of the Sanctuary, the Glosse of the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:49559:16"/>
Pulpit, as the practise of the Chamber;
without which, the devotion, the humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Temple this day, is but a Pagean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
of Piety; without which, repentance
may be sought in our repentance, and not
found, as <hi>Florus</hi> complained of <hi>Samnium</hi>

            <p>Confession is but a scanty essay of this

            <p>A true penitential sorrow is not attrite,
(in the Schoolmens style) merely the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct

the deep impression of our sins:

The remorse of Conscience for any

them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aquinas's</hi> definition of Repentance is
Concise and Orthodox. Repentance is a
sorrow for sin, with a purpose of amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Austin</hi>'s counsel corresponds herewith;
Mourn for past sin,<note place="margin">Dole de pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terito pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, cave de futuro. <hi>Aug.</hi>
               </note> beware of future. Let
not our resolutions, like Embrio's, perish in
the womb.</p>
            <p>Let not these cords be untwisted, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravelled
by the opportunities, the blan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dishments
of inveigling darling vices.</p>
            <p>The repentance of life, is the life, the
power, the lustre of repentance; without
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:49559:17"/>
which, the profession of it is but a collusion.</p>
            <p>We do but personate repentance this
day in the Church, our Religious Exercises
are but scenes, disguises; if whilst we so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly
deplore our offences, we do not
sincerel desert them. It is the sorrow of a
Crocodile to lament for that mischief we
yet indulge, pursue; secretly to embrace,
caress that wickedness, which we openly
declare to nauseate; not to abandon that
guilt, which we profess to abhor.</p>
            <p>Our Fasts, our Austerities, are proper
Auxiliaries of repentance; our reformed
practises are the choice accomplishments of
it.</p>
            <p>Our mortification initiates, begins this
duty; our reformation consummates, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
it.</p>
            <p>In this notion, the <hi>Thesis</hi> of <hi>Luther,</hi> so
much bogled at, <hi>That true repentance is a
new life,</hi> is opposed by Invectives more than
Arguments, confuted by Satyr more than
Logick.</p>
            <p>Neither the Divinity, nor the Grammar of
the Text, will warrant or dispence with the
dilatoriness of the Task; to resemble the <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cassians,</hi>
not to be devout till impotent, decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit;
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:49559:18"/>
not to resort to the Temple, till we are
upon the brink of the Grave. The Powers
of Darkness are not stagger'd with a sigh,
nor o'er-whelmed by a tear; they are not
vanquish'd by a faint, languishing, gasping
breath.</p>
            <p>Could Satan, having fortifi'd his interest
by vitious habits and customs be so easily
ejected out of possession,<note place="margin">Qui promisit poenitenti ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niam, non prom-sit pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canti poeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiam <hi>Aug.</hi>
               </note> dethroned out of
his Dominion; yet that God, who hath
promised remission to him that repenteth,
hath not promised repentance to him that
sinneth, especially voluntarily, deliberately.
We are not ascertained of future grace, to
excite, to promote this duty; nor of time to
actuate, to exercise it.</p>
            <p>In all the pomps, the jollities of life, we
are upon the border of death.</p>

               <hi>Drusus</hi> received a deaths wound by a

            <p>An excessive delight hath, to some, by a
sudden dilatation, dispersion of the spirits
leaving the heart unguarded, ushered in the
terror of death.</p>
            <p>Gods sharpest judgments, inflicted or
dreaded, are the most piercing motives of
penitential duties.</p>

            <p>In order hereto, to recapitulate, to summe up
what I have enlarged;</p>
            <p>I have unclaspt my Text to two Propositions.
The one Negative, Implicite; the other Positive,
Explicite. The Negative, Implicite, being thus
unveiled: Neither the miserable <hi>Galileans,</hi> nor
those unfortunate Wretches at <hi>Siloam,</hi> were
greater offendors than other <hi>Israelites.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have offered at a double surveigh of the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative
Proposition, Historical, as to each instance
severally, Doctrinal joyntly, in this tenor. The
greatest pressures, the sharpest miseries, the sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
periods of this life, are no demonstrative ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
to conclude the greatest sinners.</p>
            <p>In the second Proposition, I have pointed out

the restrictive, adversative Particle, [<hi>But<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>I have observed two evident symptoms of the
Divine destructive displeasure, when the sin and
the doom are like parallel lines, and when the
latter is the close train of the former.</p>
            <p>I have, in the second Proposition, recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Duty to be discharged, <hi>Repentance,</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail
that guilt we have committed, not to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
that guilt we have bewailed; not to be scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
dilatory in the exercise of it, but expeditely,
vigorously to rectifie our judgments, to refine our
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:49559:21"/>
affections, to reform our lives; to crucifie those
lusts that have crucified our Redeemer, that these
Scorpions may afford medicines for their own
stings. To abstain from our Viands, and not ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities,
is the Fast, not of sacred Converts, but of
damned Fiends.</p>
            <p>It is a disconsolate severe determination of St.
<hi>Augustine,</hi>
               <note place="margin">plures perie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt poeniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia, quam pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cato. <hi>Aug.</hi>
               </note> which I can never recollect without
anguish of spirit, <hi>More have perish'd by repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
than by sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Restorative hath degenerated to a Bane;
this Balsam of Life, misapprehended, misappli'd,
hath wounded multitudes to death.</p>
            <p>To promote an accurate unblemish'd repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
I have set out the penalty to be incurred
upon the neglect of it. A Sentence like <hi>Elijah's</hi>
little Cloud scarce discernible at first aspect,
but being dilated, blackens the Heavens, teems
with showers of perils, disasters.</p>
            <p>I have pointed out the extremity of the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
not a decay, but a period, [<hi>You shall perish</hi>]
the Universality [<hi>All</hi>] the Similitude [<hi>Likewise</hi>]
enwrapt in the same dismal fate. It was an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val
of forty years before this doom was fulfilled.
Christ thus long protracted the Execution, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he pronounced the Sentence. <hi>Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar</hi>
had a years respite after Judgment was past,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:49559:21"/>
for transforming him from a humane to a brutish
shape. The <hi>Ninivites</hi> were reprieved forty days,
and they repented in sackcloth and ashes.<note place="margin">Non mutat voluntatem, sed vult mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tationem.</note> God
then reverst his Judgment, without any stain of
instability, inconstancy; not by changing his
will, his purpose in himself, but willing, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
a change in the effect, as the School-men
state it; whose decision not apprehended by
<hi>Jonah,</hi> excited his peevish regret. He preferred
the imaginary reputation of a Prophet, before the
real preservation of a populous Kingdom; being
discomposed, that God was more merciful than
himself.</p>
            <p>Let not these <hi>Ninivites</hi> rise up in judgment
against us. If we do not seasonably dread the
menace, arrest the judgment, we shall irrecove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
sink under the pressure, the horrour of it.</p>
            <p>We have of late years enjoy'd tranquillity,
plenty, the delicious fruits of peace, whilst other

Cities besieg'd, batter'd, storm'd, defac'd, rifl'd:
Proprietaries, Masters, treated as Aliens, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as strangers, but prisoners, vassals in their own

whilst populous Territories, furnished
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:49559:22"/>
with the choicest accommodations, have been
depopulated, wasted, even reduced to Desarts.</p>
            <p>They have been subjects of intelligence, of
discourse; no motive of commiseration towards
others, of reflection upon our selves. Who less
afflicted, have been more depraved. I wish from
my Soul it were a scandal to assert it.</p>

Prayers and Fasts become incitements of Drol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries,
of Scurrilities; when there is not so much
piety as hypocrisie; not so much beauty of
holiness, as the paint, the varnish of it, even to
out-strip the spirit of darkness, not to regard to
appear Angels of Light. We may then imagine
God pathetically expostulating the case, <hi>Shall not

the indignation of that God is inflamed who is
a consuming fire; when all the expedients, the
methods of the Discipline of Heaven, prove in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual

Gods mercies are intermingled with the severi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of his menaces, like the Sun-beams in showers
of rain. He denounces his judgments, that he

Consuls, wrapt up for an abatement of seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity:
When he lays it to the root of the tree,

Come now, and let us reason together, saith the Lord;
though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be white as

To stagger such Sophistry of Miscreants,
the Prophet <hi>Amos</hi> sets out Gods fierce displeasure,
as the Painter did <hi>Agamemnon's</hi> deep sorrow (for

(not to distil a tear in a reiterated storm) not to

of each affliction,<note place="margin">Amos 4. 6, 8, 9, 10, 11.</note> (five times recorded in one

Let us meet the Lord of Hosts in his
