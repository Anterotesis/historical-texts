            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN INTRODUCTION To the following DISCOURSE.</head>
            <p>WHen I write of Justification <hi>before God,</hi> from the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful curse of the Law; then I must speak of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Grace, Christ, the Promise and Faith: but when I speak of our Justification before Men, then I must joyn to these, <hi>good Works.</hi> For Grace, Christ, and Faith are things invisible, and so not to be seen by another, otherwise than
<pb facs="tcp:48078:3"/>
through a life that becomes so bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed a Gospel as has declared unto us the remission of our sins for the sake of Jesus Christ. He then that would have Forgiveness of Sins, and so be delivered from the Curse of God, must believe in the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness and Blood of Christ: but he that would <hi>shew</hi> to his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours that he hath truly received this Mercy of God, must do it by <hi>good Works;</hi> for all things else to them, is but talk: As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample; A Tree is known to be what it is, to wit, whether of this or that kind, by it's Fruit. A Tree it is without Fruit, but so long as it <hi>so</hi> abideth, there is mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred occasion to doubt what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Tree it is.</p>
            <p>A Professor is a Professor though he hath no good Works; but that,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Matth. 7.17, 18. Jam 2.18.</hi>
               </note> as such, he is truly godly; he is foolish that so concludeth. Not that Works make a Man good; for the Fruit maketh not a good Tree,
<pb facs="tcp:48078:3"/>
it is the Principle, to wit, Faith,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Matt. 7.16. Luk. 6.44.</hi>
               </note> that makes a Man good, and his works that shew him to be so.</p>
            <p>What then? why, all Professors that have not <hi>good Works</hi> flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from their <hi>Faith,</hi> are naught;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Heb. 6.8.</hi>
               </note> are Bramble-bushes; are nigh un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Cursing, whose end is to be bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. For Professors by their fruitlesness declare that they are not of the planting of God; nor the Wheat:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Matt. 13.37, 38.</hi>
               </note> but Tares and Children of the Wicked one.</p>
            <p>Not that Faith needeth good works as an help to Justification before God. For in this matter Faith will be ignorant of all good Works, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept those done by the Person of Christ. Here then the good Man worketh not, but believeth:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom. 4.3, 4, 5.</hi>
               </note> for he is not now to carry to God, but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive at his Hand the matter of his Justification by Faith; nor is the matter of his Justification be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God ought else but the good deeds of another Man, to wit, Christ Jesus.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:48078:4"/>But is there therefore <hi>no</hi> need at all of good Works, because a Man is justified before God without them? or can that be called a ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifying Faith that has not for its Fruit,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Job 22.2, 3. Jam. 2.20, 26.</hi>
               </note> good Works? Verily good works are necessary, though God need them not, nor is that Faith, as to Justification with God, worth a rush, that abideth alone, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>A twofold Faith.</hi>
               </note>There is therefore a twofold Faith of Christ in the World, and as to the <hi>notion</hi> of Justifying Righteousness, they both concur and agree, but as to the manner of application there they vastly differ.</p>
            <p>The one, to wit, the <hi>non-saving</hi> faith, standeth in speculation and na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ked knowledg of Christ, and so abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth idle:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Joh. 1.12. Heb. 11.13. Rom. 10.16.</hi>
               </note> but the other truly seeeth, and receives him, and so becometh Fruitful. And hence the true ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifying Faith, is said to <hi>receive,</hi> to <hi>imbrace,</hi> to <hi>obey</hi> the Son of God as tendred in the Gospel: by
<pb facs="tcp:48078:4"/>
which expressions is shewed both the nature of Justifying Faith, in its actings in point of Justification, and also the cause of its being full of good Works in the World. A gift is not made mine by my seeing of it, or because I know the nature of the thing so given: but then it is mine if I <hi>receive</hi> and <hi>imbrace</hi> it, yea, and as to the point in hand, if I yield my self up to stand and fall by it. Now he that shall, not only <hi>see,</hi> but <hi>receive,</hi> not only <hi>know,</hi> but <hi>imbrace</hi> the Son of God; to be justified by him, cannot but bring forth good Works, because Christ who is now received and imbraced by Faith,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Acts 15.9. Ch. 26.18, 19. Heb. 11.11,</hi>
               </note> leavens and seasons the Spirit of this Sinner (through his Faith) to the making of him ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable so to be. Faith made <hi>Sarah</hi> receive Strength to conceive Seed, and we are Sanctified through Faith, which is in Christ. For Faith hath joyned Christ, and the Soul together, and being so joyned, the
<pb facs="tcp:48078:5"/>
Soul is one Spirit with him: not essentially but in agreement, and oneness of design. Besides, when Christ is truly received and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced to the justifying of the sinner, in that Mans Heart he dwels by his Word and Spirit through the same Faith also. Now Christ by his Spirit and Word must needs season the Soul he thus dwells in: so then the Soul being seasoned, it season<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Body, and Body and Soul, the Life and Conversation.</p>
            <p>We know it is not the <hi>Seeing,</hi> but <hi>taking</hi> of a potion that maketh it work as it should, nor is the Blood of Christ a Purge to this or that Conscience, except <hi>received</hi> by Faith.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Heb. 9.14.</hi>
               </note>Shall that then be counted right believing in Christ unto justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that amounts to no more than to an idle speculation, or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked knowledg of him? shall that knowledg of him I say be counted such, as only causes the Soul to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
<pb facs="tcp:48078:5"/>
hold but moveth it not to good Works? No verily.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>2 Cor. 3.18.</hi>
               </note> For the true beholding of Jesus to justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and Life, changes from glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to glory.</p>
            <p>Nor can that Man that hath <hi>so</hi> believed, as that by his Faith he hath <hi>received</hi> and <hi>imbraced</hi> Christ for Life before God, be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute of good works: for, as I said, the Word and Spirit comes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so by this Faith, and dwels in the Heart and Conscience: now, shall a Soul where the Word and Spirit of Christ dwels, be a Soul without good Works? Yea, shall a Soul that has received the Love, the Mercy, the Kindness, Grace and Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God through the Sorrows, Tears, Groans, Cross and Cruel Death of Christ, be yet a Fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Tree! God forbid. This faith is as the Salt which the Prophet cast into the Spring of bitter Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>2 King 2.19, 20, 21, 22.</hi>
               </note> it makes the Soul good and serviceable for ever.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:48078:6"/>If the receiving of a temporal Gift, naturally tends to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of us to move our Cap and Knee: and binds us to be the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of the Giver: shall we think that <hi>Faith</hi> will leave him who by it has received Christ, to be as uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned as a Stock or Stone, or that it's utmost excellency is to provoke the Soul to a lip-labour, and to give Christ a few fair Words for his Pains and Grace: and so wrap up the business? No, no: the Love of Christ constraineth <hi>us</hi> thus to judge that it is but reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>2 Cor. 5.14</hi>
               </note> since he gave his <hi>all</hi> for us, that we should give our <hi>some</hi> for him.</p>
            <p>Let no Man then deceive him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self (as he may and will if he takes not heed, with true Notions) but examine himself concerning his Faith, to wit; Whether he hath any, and if some, Whether of that kind that will turn to account in the day when God shall judge the world.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:48078:6"/>I told you before that there is a twofold Faith;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Two sorts of Works.</hi>
               </note> and now I will tell you that there are two sorts of good works: and a Man may be shroud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly guess'd at with reference to his Faith, even by the Works that he chuseth to be conversant in.</p>
            <p>There are Works that cost no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and Works that are charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able: And observe it, The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sound Faith will chuse to it self the most easie works it can find. For example, there is Reading, Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, hearing of Sermons, Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, Breaking of Bread, Church fellowship, Preaching, and the like: and there is mortification of Lusts, Charity, Simplicity, open-Heartedness, with a liberal Hand to the Poor, and their like also. Now the unsound Faith picks and chuses, and takes and leaves, but the true Faith does not so.</p>
            <p>There are a great many Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors now in <hi>England,</hi> that have nothing to distinguish them from
<pb facs="tcp:48078:7"/>
the worst of Men, but their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Reading, hearing of Sermons, Baptism, Church Fellowship, and Breaking of Bread. Separate them but from these, and every where else they are as black as others, even in their whole Life and Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Thus they have chosen to them the most easy things to do them, but love not to be Conscio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably found in the practice of the other: a certain sign their Faith is nought, and that these things, even the things they are conversant in, are things attended to of them, not for the ends for which God has appointed them, but to beguile and undo themselves withall.</p>
            <p>Praying, Hearing, Reading; for what are these things Ordained, but that we might by the godly use of them, attain to more of the knowledg of God, and be strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened by his Grace to serve him bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter according to his moral Law? Baptism, Fellowship, and the
<pb facs="tcp:48078:7"/>
Lords Supper, are Ordained for these ends also. But there is a vast difference between using of these things, and a using of them for these ends. A Man may pray, yea, pray for such things, had he them, as would make him better in Morals, without desire to be better in Mortals, or Love to the things he prays for. A Man may Read and Hear, not to learn to do, though to know: Yea, he may be dead to doing Moral goodness, and yet be great for Reading and Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, all his days. The people then among all Professors,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tit. 2.14.</hi>
               </note> that are <hi>zealous</hi> of good Works, are the <hi>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar</hi> ones to Christ. What has a man done that is Baptized, if he pursues not the ends for which that appointment was Ordained: the like I say of Fellowship, of Breaking of Bread, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For all these things we should use to Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port our Faith, to mortifie the Flesh, and strengthen us to walk
<pb facs="tcp:48078:8"/>
in newness of Life by the rule of the moral Law. Nor can that Man be esteemed holy, whose life is tainted with immoralities, let him be what he can in all things else. I am of that mans mind as to practical Righteousness, who said to Christ upon this very questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<note place="margin">

               <hi>Well Master, thou hast said the Truth: For to Love the Lord our God with all the Heart, and with all the Understanding, and with all the Soul, and with all the Strength: and to love his Neighbour as himself, is more than all whole burn-offerings and sacrifices.</hi> To love my Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour as my self, to do as I would be done unto, this is the Law and the Prophets. And he that is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a stranger to these things, how dwelleth the Love of God in him? or how will he manifest to another that his Faith will save him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:48078:8"/>Satan is afraid that Men should hear of justification by Christ, lest they should imbrace it: but yet if he can prevail with them, to keep Fingers off, though they do hear and look on, and practice lesser things, he can the better bear it. Yea, he will labour to make such Professors bold to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude they shall by that kind of Faith injoy him, though by that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not imbrace him, nor lay hold of him. For he knows that how far soever a Man ingages in a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of Christ with a Faith that looks on, but cannot receive nor imbrace him, that Faith will leave him to nothing but mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes and disappointments at last.</p>
            <p>The Gospel comes to some in Word only,<note place="margin">

               </note> and the Faith of such stands but in a verbal sound: but the Apostle was resolved not to know, or take notice of such a Faith: <hi>For the Kingdom of
<pb facs="tcp:48078:9"/>
God,</hi> saith he, <hi>is not in Word, but in Power.</hi> He whose Faith stands only in a <hi>saying, I believe,</hi> has his Works in bare Words also, and as vertual is the one as the other, and both insignificant e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough. <hi>If a Brother or a Sister be naked or destitute of daily Food.</hi>

               </note> And one of you say un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, Depart in peace, be you warmed and filled: notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing you give them not those things which are needful to the body, what doth it profit? Even so Faith, if it hath not Works is dead, being alone.</p>
            <p>This Faith therefore, Satan can allow,<note place="margin">

               </note> because it is somewhat of kin to his own.</p>
            <p>Besides, What greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt can be cast upon Christ than by such wordy Professors is cast upon him? These are the men that by practice say, The Gospel is but an empty sound. Yea, the more they profess, the louder they
<pb facs="tcp:48078:9"/>
proclaim it thus to be to his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, while they, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their prosession of Faith, hold and maintain their League with the Devil and Sin.</p>
            <p>The Son of God was manifest that he might destroy the works of the Devil,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>1 John 3.</hi>
               </note> but these men profess his Faith and keep these Works alive in the World. Shall these pass for such as believe to the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the Soul. For a man to be content with this kind of Faith, and to look to go to Salvation by it: what to God is a greater pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation?</p>
            <p>The Devil laugheth here, for he knows he has not lost his Vassal by such a Faith as this, but that rather he hath made use of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, that glorious Word of Life, to secure his Captive through his presumption of the right Faith, the faster in his shackles.</p>
            <p>It is marvelous to me to see sin so high amidst the swarms of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors
<pb facs="tcp:48078:10"/>
that are found in every cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of this Land. Nor can any other reason be given for it, but because the Gospel has lost its won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vertue, or because Professors want Faith therein. But do you think it is because of the first? no; the word of our God shall stand (in its strength) for ever: the Faith of such therefore is not right, they have for Shields of Gold, made themselves Shields of Brass: or instead of the Primitive Faith, which was of the operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>2 Chron. 12.9, 10. Col. 2.12. 1 Cor. 2.4, 5.</hi>
               </note> they have got to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves a Faith that stands by the power, and in the Wisdom of Man.</p>
            <p>And to say no more to this; for what is God so angry with this Land, but for the sin of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors that dwell therein, while they have polluted his name with their <hi>Gifts,</hi> and with their <hi>Idols</hi>? God, I say, has been provoked most bitterly by us, while we have
<pb facs="tcp:48078:10"/>
profaned his name, making use of his Name, his Word and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances to serve our selves (O Lord what wilt thou do to this Land!). We are every one looking for something; even for some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that carrieth terrour and dread in the sound of its Wings as it comes, though we know not the form nor visage thereof. One cries out, another has his Hands upon his Loyns, and a third is made mad with the sight of his Eyes, and with what his Ears do hear. And as their Faith hath served them about Justification: so it now serves them about Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and Reformation, it can do nothing here neither, for though, as was said, Men cry out, and are with their Hands upon their Loyns for fear: yet where is the Church, the House, the Man that stands in the gap for the Land to turn away this Wrath by Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and amendment of Life.
<pb facs="tcp:48078:11"/>
Behold the Lord cometh forth out of his place, and will come down and tread upon the places of the Earth, and the Mountains shall be molten under him, and the Valleys shall be cleft, as Wax before the Fire, and as the Waters that are poured down a steep place (but what is the cause of all this?) <hi>For the transgression of</hi> Jacob <hi>is all this,</hi>

               </note> 
               <hi>and for the Sin of the House of</hi> Israel.</p>
            <p>It is that that is observed by them that can make Observation, that all that God has done to us already, has been ineffectual as to cause that Humility and Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, by which his judgments must be turned away. Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is <hi>rare this</hi> day, and yet without doubt, that without which things will grow worse and worse. As for them that hope that God will save his people, though but from temporal Judgments, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they Repent and Reform, or
<pb facs="tcp:48078:11"/>
do otherwise: I must leave them and their Opinions together: this I have found, that sometimes the Repentance, even of the Godly, has come too late to divert such Judgments. And how some of the Godly should be so indulged as to be saved from punishment with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Repentance, when the true and unfeigned Repentance of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers will not deliver them, leaves me, I confess, in a Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness.</p>
            <p>But that which is most of all to be lamented, is, That sin, through custom, is become no sin. The <hi>superfluity</hi> of naughtiness is at this day become no sin with many.</p>
            <p>Surely this was the case with <hi>Israel,</hi> else how could they say when the Prophets so bitterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced Gods judgments against them, <hi>Because we are innocent,</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:48078:12"/>
sin: it is a sign that Soul is in a dangerous <hi>Lethargy</hi>: and yet this is the condition of the most that profess amongst us this day. But to leave this and to proceed.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>A twofold love to Christ.</hi>
               </note>As there is a twofold Faith, two sorts of good Works, and the like, so there is also <hi>A twofold love to Christ.</hi> The one standing or stopping in some passions of the mind, and affections. The other is that which breaks through all difficulties to the holy Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to do it. Of both these there is mention made in the Scripture: And though all true Love begins at the Heart, yet that love is but little set by that breaks not through to practice. How many are there in the World that seem to have the first, but how few shew the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond.<note place="margin">

               </note> The young Man in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel did by his running, kneeling, crying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> enquiring and intreating of Christ to shew him the way to Life, shew that he had inward
<pb facs="tcp:48078:12"/>
Love to Christ and his own Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but yet it was not a love that was strong as Death,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cant. 8.6.</hi>
               </note> cruel as the Grave, and hotter than the Coles of Juniper. It was a Love that stopt in <hi>mind</hi> and <hi>affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> but could not break out into Practice. This kind of Love, if it be let alone, and not pressed to proceed till it comes into a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring practising of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, will love as long as you will, to wit, as long as Mouth and Tongue can wag; but yet you shall not by all your skill drive this Love farther than the Mouth. For with their Mouth they shew much Love,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ezek. 33.31.</hi>
               </note> but their Heart goeth after their Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousness.</p>
            <p>Nor may this Love be counted for that of the right kind, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is in the Heart, for the Heart knows how to dissemble a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Love, as much as about other matters. This is feigned Love,
<pb facs="tcp:48078:13"/>
or Love that pretends to dear af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections for Christ, but can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow no cost upon him. Of this kind of Love the world is full at this day, especially the Professors of this Age, but as I said, of this the Lord Jesus makes little or no account, for that it hath in it an essential defectiveness.</p>
            <p>Thus therefore Christ and his Servants describe the love that is true and of the right kind, and that with reference to himself and Church.</p>
            <p>First, with reference to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. <hi>If a man loves me,</hi> saith he,<note place="margin">

tongue: Not in great and seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly affectionate gestures, but in a practical walking in the Law of the Lord. Hence such, and such only are called the undefiled in the way. (You know who sayes, <hi>I am the way.) Blessed,</hi>

               </note> the hypocrite will give us the slip by betaking of himself to exterior matters, as to his mint, anise, and cummin: still neglecting the more weighty mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Law, to wit, Judgment, Mercy, Faith.

But let such know that God never ordained <hi>significative</hi> ordinances, such as <hi>Baptism,</hi> the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> or the like, for the sake of Water, or of Bread and Wine: nor yet because he takes any delight that we are
<pb facs="tcp:48078:14"/>
dipped in Water, or eat that bread: but they were ordained to minister to us by the aptness of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, through our sincere par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of them, further knowledg of the death, Burial, and Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Christ; and of our death and resurrection by him to newness of life. Wherefore he that eateth and believeth not, and he that is <hi>Baptized,</hi> and is not dead to sin, and walketh not in newness of Life, neither keepeth these ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances nor pleaseth God. Now to be dead to sin, is to be dead to those things forbidden in the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Law: For sin is the transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of that, and it availeth not to vaunt that I am a Saint and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this or that significative ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, if I live in the transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the Law.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>1 Joh. 3.4.</hi>
               </note> For I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed of the Law as a transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor, and so concluded to be one that loveth not Christ, tho' I make a noise of my obedience to Christ,
<pb facs="tcp:48078:14"/>
and of my partaking of his signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cative ordinances. The Jews of old made a great noise with their significative ordinances, whiles they lived in the breach of the moral Law, but their practice of significative ordinances could not save them from the judgement and displeasure of their God. They could frequent the Temple, keep their feasts, slay their Sacrifices, and be mighty apt about all their signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficative things. But they loved I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols, and lived in the breach of the second Table of the Law. Wherefore God cast them out of his presence: hark what the Prophet saith of them. <hi>Come to Bethel, and transgress,</hi>
               <note place="margin">

<pb facs="tcp:48078:15"/>
of Israel, saith the Lord God.</hi> Thus as I said, the hypocrite gives us the slip; for when he heareth that love is in the keeping of the Commandments of God, then he betakes him to the more external parts of worship, and neglecteth the more weighty matters, to the provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the God of <hi>Israel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> As love to God is shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by keeping of his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: So love to my Neighbour is the keeping of the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God likewise. <hi>By this we know that we love the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>1 John 5.2, 3.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>when we love God, and keep his Commandments. For this is the love of God (in us, both to God and Man,) that we keep his Commandments, and his Commandments are not grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous.</hi> He that keepeth not Gods Commandments, loves neither God nor Men.</p>
            <p>Thus then we must learn to love one anoth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Gods Commandment, doth to his brother what is right, for that is Gods Commandment. He that keeps Gods Commandment doth to his Brother even as he would be done unto himself, for that is Gods Commandment. He that keeps Gods Commandment shutteth not up his bowels of Compassion from him: for the contrary is his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment. Further, He that keepeth Gods Commandment shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his Brother what he must do to honour the Christ that he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth, aright: Therefore he that keeps the Commandment, loves his brother. Yea, the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Commandment is loving the Brethren.</p>
            <p>But if all love which we pretend to have one to another, were tryed by this one Text, how much of that that we call so would be found to be nothing less? Preposterous are our Spirits in all things, nor can they be guided right but by the
<pb facs="tcp:48078:16"/>
word and spirit of God: the which the good Lord grant unto us plentifully, that we may do that which is well pleasing in his sight through Jesus Christ our Lord.

               <hi>TImothy,</hi> unto whom this Epistle was writ,<note place="margin">chap. 4, 5, Ephes. 4.11.</note> was an <hi>Evangelist,</hi> that is, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior to Apostles and extraordinary Prophets, and above ordinary Pastors and Teachers. And he with the rest of those under his circumstances was to go with the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48078:18"/>
Apostles hither, and thither, to be disposed of by them as they saw need for the further edification of those who by the Apostolical Ministry were converted to the Faith: And hence it is that <hi>Titus</hi> was left at <hi>Creet,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 1.3.</note> and that this <hi>Timothy</hi> was left at <hi>Ephesus.</hi> For they were to do a work for Christ in the world, which the Apostles were to begin, and leave upon their hand to finish. Now when the Apostles departed from places, and had left these Evangelists in their stead, usually there did arise some bad Spirits among those people, where these were left for the further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Faith. This is manifest by both the Epistles to <hi>Timothy,</hi> and also by that to <hi>Titus</hi>: wherefore <hi>Paul,</hi> upon whom these two <hi>Evangelists</hi> waited for the fulfilling of their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry, writeth unto them while they abode where he left them, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning those turbulent Sprits which they met with, and to teach them how yet further they ought to behave themselves in the house of God, which is the Church of the living God, the pillar and ground of truth. And to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48078:18"/>
he gives them severally divers instructions (as the judicious Reader may easily understand) by which he incourageth them to the prosecution of that service which for Christ they had to do for those people where he had left them, and also instructeth them how to carry it towards their disturbers, which last he doth, not only Doctrinally, but also by shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them by his example and practice, what he would have them do.</p>
            <p>This done, he laboureth to comfort <hi>Timothy</hi> with the remembrance of the stedfastness of Gods eternal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of Election, because grounded on his foreknowledge; saying, tho' <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Philetus</hi> have erred from the Faith, and by their fall, have overthrown the Faith of some, <hi>Yet the foundation of God standeth sure, having this Seal, the Lord knoweth them that are his</hi>: Now lest this last hint should still incourage some to be remiss and carnally secure, and foolish, as I suppose this Doctrine abused, had incouraged them to be before: Therefore the Apostle immediately conjoyneth to it, this exhortation: <hi>And, let every one that
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48078:19"/>
nameth the name of Christ, depart from iniquity.</hi> Two truths strangely, but necessarily joyned together, because so apt to be severed by the children of men; for many under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of their being elected, neglect to pursue Holiness; and many of them again that pretend to be for Holiness, quite exclude the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, and motives that election gives thereto. Wherefore, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle, that he might set mens no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as to these things, right, he joyns these two together, signifying thereby, that as electing love doth instate a man in the blessing of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life, so Holiness is the path thereto; and, that he that refuseth to depart from iniquity shall be damned, notwithstanding he may think himself secured from Hell by the act of Gods electing love.

                  </item>

               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The Exhortation is, <hi>That men depart from iniquity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The Extension of it, is to <hi>them, all</hi> of them, <hi>every one of them that name the name of Christ. And, let e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Exhortation there are several things to be taken notice of, because insinuated by the Apostle.</p>
            <p>The first is, <hi>That iniquity is a very dangerous and hurtful thing,</hi> as to the Souls of sinners in general, so to them that name the name of Christ.</p>
            <p>It is very a dangerous and hurtfull thing to men in general. For 'tis that which did captivate the world
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:48078:20"/>
at the beginning, and that made it a bondslave to the Devil. It has also done great hurt to mankind ever since, to instance a few things:</p>
            <p n="1">
               <note place="margin">2 Pet. 2.12.</note>1. 'Tis that which hath stupefied and besotted the powers of mens Souls, and made them even next to a Beast and Brute in all matters su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural and heavenly. For as the Beast minds nothing but his lusts, and his belly, by nature: So man minds nothing but things earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, sensual and devilish, by reason of iniquity.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <note place="margin">Eph. 4.18.</note>2. It has blinded and darkned the powers of the Soul, so that it can neither see where it is, nor which is the way out of this besotted conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <note place="margin">Rom. 2 5.</note>3. It has hardened the heart a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God, and against all admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition and counsel in the things of the Gospel of Christ.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <note place="margin">Colos. 1.21.</note>4. It has alienated the <hi>will,</hi> the <hi>mind,</hi> and <hi>affections</hi> from the choice of the things that should save it, and wrought them over to an hearty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in those things, that naturally tend to drown it in perdition and destruction.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:48078:20"/>5. It has made man odious in Gods eyes,<note place="margin">Ezek. 16.5.</note> it has provoked the Justice of God against him, and made him <hi>obnoxious</hi> to Hell fire.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Yea, It <hi>so</hi> holds him,<note place="margin">Pro. 5.22.</note> 
               <hi>so</hi> binds him, <hi>so</hi> reserves him to <hi>this,</hi> that, not he himself, nor yet all the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels of Heaven, can deliver him from this deplorable condition.</p>
            <p n="7">7. To say nothing of the pleasure and delight that it makes him take in that way to Hell in which he walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.<note place="margin">Isa. 66.3. Pro. 7.22, 23, 24.25.</note> Never went fat Oxe so game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somely to the shambles, nor fool so merrily to the correction of the stocks, nor silly bird so wantonly to the hidden net, as <hi>iniquity</hi> makes men go down <hi>her</hi> steps to the pit of hell and damnation.</p>
            <p>O 'tis amazing, 'tis astonishing to consider what hurt sin has done to man, and into how many dangers it has brought him: but let these few hints at this time suffice as to this. I will now speak a word to the other particular: namely, that as <hi>iniquity</hi> is dangerous and hurtful to the Souls of Men in general, so it is to them that name the name of Christ. As to the <hi>so,</hi> and <hi>so</hi> naming of him, to that
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:48078:21"/>
I shall speak by and by, but at this time take it thus: <hi>That religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously name his name.</hi> And I say <hi>iniquity</hi> is hurtful to them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It plucks many a one of them from Christ, and the religious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of him. I have even seen, that men who have devoutly and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiously professed Jesus Christ, have been prevailed withall by <hi>iniquity</hi> to cast him and the profession of his name quite off, and to turn their backs upon him. <hi>Israel,</hi> saith the Prophet, <hi>has cast off the thing that is good.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hos. 8.3.</note> But why? <hi>Of their Silver and their gold they have made Idols.</hi> The sin of Idolatry drew their hearts from God: their love to that <hi>ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity</hi> made them turn their backs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him. Wherefore God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains, that of forwardness to their <hi>iniquity,</hi> and through the prevalence thereof,<note place="margin">Ezek. 23.35.</note> they had cast him behind their back.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As it plucks many a professor <hi>from</hi> Christ; so it keeps many a one from an effectual closing <hi>with</hi> him. How many are there that religiously profess and make mention of the name of Chri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t, that yet of love to,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:48078:21"/>
and by the interest that <hi>iniquity</hi> hath in their affections, never close with him unto salvation, but are like to them of whom you read in <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Tim. 3.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.</note> that they are ever learning and never come to the knowledg of the truth.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And concerning those that have indeed come to him, and that have effectually closed with him, and that name his name to good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose: yet how hath <hi>iniquity</hi> hurt and abused many of them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It has prevailed with God to hide his face from them, a thing more bitter than death.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It has prevailed with God to chastize, and to afflict them sorely;<note place="margin">Lam. 3.33.</note> a thing in which he taketh no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It has provoked God to give them over to the hand of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,<note place="margin">Jer. 12, 7. Mat. 18.34.</note> and to deliver them to the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentors.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It hath brought them to questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their interest in <hi>Christ,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psa. 31.22.</note> and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they ever had grace in their Souls.</p>
            <p n="5">5. And for those that have yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved they were in his favour,<note place="margin">Psal. 51.</note> this
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:48078:22"/>
               <hi>iniquity</hi> has driven them to fear that God would cast them away, and take all his good things from them.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Psa. 38.8. Psa. 31.10. Psa. 6.6. Jer. 31.18. 2 Cor. 12.21. Psa. 116.3. Ps. 31.3.4. Jo 13.27. Psal. 88. Lam. 3.4. Lam. 3.16. Jer. 8.14. Chap. 23.15. Psal. 60.3. Ezek 4.16.</note>Yea, he that would know the hurt that <hi>iniquity</hi> hath done to them, that name the name of Christ, let him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the <hi>cries,</hi> the <hi>sighs,</hi> the <hi>tears,</hi> the <hi>bemoanings,</hi> the bewailings, the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations, the sorrows, the confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions the repentings and griefs where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they have been attended, while they have complained that they have been put in the stocks, laid in the dungeon, had their bones broken, suffered the terours of God, been distressed almost to distraction, and have been fed with Gravel, Gall, Wormwood, and with the Water of astonishment for days, yea, years together. By all which, and many more which might be mentioned, it appears that <hi>iniquity</hi> is a dangerous and hurtfull thing.</p>
            <p>But I proceed, and come in the next place to the Extension of the exhortation: namely, that it reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to all those that name the name of Christ. <hi>And let every one that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the name of Christ depart from ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</hi> To handle this a little, and,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:48078:22"/>First, to shew you what the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle here means by naming of the name of Christ: he meaneth not an irreligious naming of that worthy, name, nor those that name it irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiously. This is evident, because, he passeth by their <hi>manner</hi> of naming of it without the least reproof, the which he would not have done, had the fault been in their manner of naming of the name of Christ. Now I say, if he intendeth not those that name the name of Christ irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiously, then tho' the exhortation [<hi>let every one</hi>] seems to extend it self to all and all manner of persons that any ways name the name of Christ, yet 'tis limited by this, to wit, <hi>that rightly,</hi> religiously, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the way of the professors of Christ, name his <hi>worthy name.</hi> And it must needs be so taken, and that for these reasons.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For that, as I said before, the Apostle taketh no notice of their manner of naming of his name, so as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o reprove any undecency or unseem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iness in their <hi>Naming</hi> of him; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he alloweth of the manner of their naming of him.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:48078:23"/>2. Because, the Apostles design in this exhortation was, and is, that the naming of the name of Christ, might be accompanied with such a life of holiness, as might put an addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional lustre upon that name when ever named in a religious way; but this cannot be applied to every man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of naming the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. For if a man shall name the name of Christ unduely, or irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giously, though he shall never so much there withall depart from <hi>iniquity,</hi> and be circumspect to the utmost in all civility and morality, yet he answers not the Apostles end which he seeks by this his exhortation, For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Suppose a man should name the name of Christ vainly, idlely, in vain mirth, wantonness, false or vain swearing, or the like, and shall back this his manner of naming the name of Christ with all manner of Justness and uprightness of life, would this answer the Apostle's end in this his exhortation? Verily no: for this manner of naming the name is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy reprehension; <hi>Thou shalt not take my name in vain,</hi> or vainly make
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:48078:23"/>
use thereof:<note place="margin">Exod. 20.</note> And moral goodness attending the so naming of the name of Christ will do more hurt than good.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There is a reproachful and scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous naming of the name of Christ, such as the <hi>Jews,</hi> and <hi>Pharisees</hi> did accustom themselves unto, as to call him <hi>Jesus,</hi> the deceiver; and <hi>Christ</hi> in a way of scorn and contempt. Nor were these men quite destitute of that which put a luster upon their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; for said the Lord Christ himself unto them,<note place="margin">Mat. 23.</note> 
               <hi>Ye indeed appear beautiful outward.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. There is such a naming of the name of Christ as to make it a cloak for false and dangerous Errors: that men, by the use of <hi>that</hi> name and the <hi>putting</hi> of it upon such errors and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusions, may put off their errors to others the better.<note place="margin">Mat. 24.5.</note> 
               <hi>Many shall come in my name,</hi> to wit with their delusions, presenting them <hi>in my name</hi> to the world, and shall put them off <hi>in my name</hi> to the destruction of the Soul. Now can any imagine that the Apostle should extend his exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to such, that <hi>they</hi> thus continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to name the name of Christ,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:48078:24"/>
               <hi>should depart from iniquity.</hi> To what end should such be comprehended in this exhortation of his? To no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose at all: for the more an erroneous person or a deceiver of Souls shall back his errors with a life that is morally good, the more mischie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous, dangerous, and damnable is that man and his delusions; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore such a one is not concerned in this exhortation.</p>
            <p n="4">4. There is a naming of the name of Christ <hi>magically,</hi> and after the manner of Exorcism, or conjuration: as we read in the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apostles. The vagabond <hi>Jews,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 19.13, 14, 15.</note> the <hi>exorcists</hi> there say, <hi>We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preacheth.</hi> Thus they called over them that had evil spirits, <hi>the name of the Lord Jesus.</hi> But what if these should cloth this their devilish art and devilish way of using or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the name of the Lord Jesus, with departing from iniquity so, as to commend their whole life to bye-standers for such as is morally good: what advantage would Christ, or <hi>Paul,</hi> or the Gospel get thereby? verily none at all, but rather dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage and reproach: as will soon ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:48078:24"/>
to any mans reason, if it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered that goodness of life joyned to badness of principles, is like the Devil clothed in white, or Satan transformed into an Angel of light. And <hi>Paul</hi> was grieved in his Spirit when the wench that had a spirit of divination did acknowledg him to be the servant of the most high God, for he knew it would nothing further or help forward the Lords design, but be rather an hindrance thereto. For when Witches and Devils come once to commend, or make use of the name of Christ, Christ and <hi>Paul</hi> like it not; therefore <hi>Pauls</hi> exhortation which here we are presented with by the Text, is not extended to any of the four sorts aforenamed, but,</p>
            <p>First,<note place="margin">Acts 15.17.</note> To those upon whom his name is called, they should depart from <hi>iniquity.</hi> I say those whom God has so far dignified, as to put the name of Christ upon them: and I will add, that apply that name to themselves. And the reason is because God is now concerned.<note place="margin">Chap. 11.26.</note> God has changed thy name from <hi>Pagan,</hi> to <hi>Christian,</hi> and thou chusest to call thy self by that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ame, saying, <hi>I belong to Christ.</hi> Now
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:48078:25"/>
thou must depart from <hi>iniquity,</hi> for that notice is taken of thee both by Heaven and Earth, that thou art be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Disciple, and <hi>let every one that</hi> (so) <hi>nameth the name of Christ,</hi> or,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 4.16.</note> that nameth it (being himself by God and himself put under such cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances as these) <hi>depart from iniquity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, It is spoken to those that name the name of Christ either in the publick, or pri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ate, worship of God: being themselves professed worshippers of him: and the reason is, for that the ordinances as well as the name of God is holy, and <hi>he will be sanctified in them that come nigh him.</hi> He therefore that approacheth the presence of Christ in prayer,<note place="margin">Lev. 10.3.</note> or any other Divine appointment, must take heed of <hi>regarding of iniquity in his heart</hi>; else the Lord will stop his ears to his prayers,<note place="margin">Psa. 66.18.</note> and will shut his eyes, and not take notice of such kind of worship or worshippers.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Those that the Apostle in this place exhorts to depart from iniquity, are such as have taken unto themselves the boldness to say, that they <hi>are</hi> in him, <hi>abide</hi> in him, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:48078:25"/>
are made partakers of the benefits that are in him. <hi>He that saith he abideth in him,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Joh. 2.6.</note> 
               <hi>ought himself also to walk even as he walked.</hi> And the reason is, because Christ is a fruitful root, and a free conveyer of sap into the branches; Hence it is written,<note place="margin">Ps. 104.16.</note> 
               <hi>that the trees of the Lord are full of sap.</hi> So then, he that nameth the name of Christ by way of applying to himself his benefits, and as counting that he is found of God in him, and so abid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, ought himself to walk even as he walked, that he may give proof of what he saith to be true, by bearing forth before men that similitude of righteousness, that is in his Root and Stem: For such as the stock or tree is, such let the branches be, but that cannot be known but by the fruit:<note place="margin">Mat. 7.16.</note> 
               <hi>by their fruit ye shall know them.</hi> So then, he that thus shall name the name of Christ, let him depart from iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: Yea, let every such man do so.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> This exhortation is spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to them that name Christ <hi>as their Sovereign Lord and King</hi>; let <hi>them</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:48078:26"/>
depart from iniquity.<note place="margin">Isa. 33.21.</note> 
               <hi>The Lord is our judge, the Lord is our Lawgiver, the Lord is our King, he will save us,</hi> are great words: and as they <hi>cannot</hi> be spoken by every one; so they <hi>ought not</hi> to be spoken lightly by them that can. Nor may he that claims so high a priviledge, be but <hi>obedient,</hi> submissive, apt to learn, conscienciously to put in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice what he hath learnt of his Judge, his Lawgiver, and his King. Lest when some shall hear him say that Christ by name is his Lawgiver, and his King (and shall yet observe him to do things evil, and to walk in ways that are not good) they should think evil and speak so of his King; saying, learnt you this of Christ your King, or doth your King countenance you in ways that are so bad? Or do you by thus and thus doing, submit to the laws of your King! Yea your King, his name and Gospel shall bear the burden of the evil, together with the shame thereof, if thou that nam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est the name of Christ, shalt not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from iniquity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:48078:26"/>
               <hi>Lastly,</hi> What ever man he be that by his naming of the name of Christ, shall intimate that he hath any reverence of love to, or delight in that Christ, whose name he nam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>that man</hi> should depart from iniquity not only for the reasons that are above mentioned, but for those that may be named afterwards. But having thus far opened the word, and shewed who, and what manner of man the Apostle had in his eye, in this his exhortation: I shall come in the next place to make some observations upon the Text. As</p>
            <p>First, <hi>That it is incident to men to name the name of Christ religiously, that is, rightly as to words and noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and not to depart from iniquity.</hi> This was the occasion of this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, for <hi>Paul</hi> saw that there were some that did so: to wit, that named the name of Christ <hi>well,</hi> as to words, but did not depart from iniquity. Some such he also found among them at <hi>Corinth,</hi> which made him say, <hi>Awake to righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and sin not</hi>;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.34.</note> he found such at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and cries out to them most
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:48078:27"/>
earnestly, saying, <hi>Awake thou that sleepest,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ephes. 5.14, 15</note> 
               <hi>and arise from the dead</hi>: for albeit they were professors of Christ, yet they lived too much like those that were dead in trespasses and sins. This he also found among the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews,</hi> wherefore he saith to them, <hi>let us lay aside every weight,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 12.1, 2, 3.</note> 
               <hi>and the sin that doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us.</hi> These professors were easily beset with sin, yea it did hang upon them as weights to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them from making of that prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesion of Christ, whose name they named, so beautiful as did become both him and them.</p>
            <p>In my discourse upon this subject, I must endeavour to shew you two things.</p>
            <p>First, <hi>What</hi> Paul <hi>means when he saith, depart from iniquity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Why some that as to words, rightly name the name of Christ, do not depart from iniquity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The first of those doth need some explanation, because in some sence even the best of Saints cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from sin, or iniquity.</p>

               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:48078:27"/>1. Because, <hi>as to the being of it, it is seated and rooted in their flesh,</hi> and hath its dwelling there. Yea, it hath, and so will have an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biding there, so long as man is on this side <hi>that</hi> state of perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is not to be injoyed while we are in the flesh: <hi>for in me,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 7.</note> 
               <hi>that is in my flesh, sin dwells,</hi> nor doth any thing else but sin dwell there: <hi>for in me, that is in my flesh</hi> (said <hi>Paul) dwells no good thing,</hi> therefore the Apostle must not be understood as if he intended to insinuate that there was a possibility that the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and being of sin could be pluckt up by the roots, and so cast clean away from us, as to the very nature thereof: no, that will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide with us, for it hath its dwelling in us.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And as they cannot depart from the nature of it as such, that is, as they cannot be rid of the being of sin, <hi>so neither can they depart from the motions, and stirrings of sin,</hi> no more than they can stir from the motions or stirrings of their natural sences, or of their natural reasons: <hi>The motions of sin,</hi> which
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:48078:28"/>
               <hi>Paul</hi> also calls the lusts thereof, will be where the nature and being of sin is, because it is not dead; for that which liveth, what manner of life soever it hath, will have motion according to the manner of life which it hath: and sin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one of the most quick and brisk things that are, it will also have its motions and lusts according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Hence <hi>Paul</hi> saies, it <hi>lusts</hi> and will <hi>lust,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 6.12. Gal. 5.17.</note> where it is, and dwells: though the very spirit of God, and the utmost diligence of a Christian be also there to oppose it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Again, as the being and moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of sin will be with us, <hi>so also will it in its indeavours.</hi> It will <hi>endeavour</hi> to overcome us, and to make us captives to it self, and to Satan; and <hi>these</hi> endeavours will be with us; nor can we so depart from iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,<note place="margin">Eph. 6.12. 2 Cor. 10.5.

from; that is, cause that it should not be in our flesh: for there it will be, since sin in its being is their.</p>
            <p n="4">4. As the being, motions, and endeavours of sin will still abide in our flesh, <hi>so consequently will its polluting fumes be upon us</hi>; nor doth the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle mean, when he bids <hi>us de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from iniquity,</hi> that we should think that we can so <hi>be,</hi> or so <hi>do,</hi> in this life, as that our <hi>being</hi> or <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> should not smell of the strong scent of sin.<note place="margin">Job. 14.4.</note> 
               <hi>Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one. We are all as an unclean thing,</hi> and therefore <hi>all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isa. 64.6.</note> The scent, the smell, the rank and odious stink of sins abides upon, yea, and will abide upon us, when most spiritual here, and upon our most spiritual acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons too, untill they be taken away by Christ. Thus far therefore, we cannot be concerned in the exho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For should <hi>Paul</hi> exhort us to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from the <hi>being, motion, endeavour,</hi> and polluting fumes and scent of sin: I mean so to depart from them, as that there shall no such thing have place,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:48078:29"/>
or motion, or striving, or scent in, or upon us: he would exhort us to that which is altogether impossible for us to perform, yea, to perform through <hi>that</hi> working of the spirit of God which is to be with us, and in us here. Yea, he must exhort us to that which he could not perform him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, but such exhortations did not stand with the wisdom of an Apostle. Wherefore there is a certain mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this exhortation, from the which if we swerve, we shall both wrong the Apostle and our selves.</p>
            <p>Let us inquire then, what <hi>Paul</hi> should mean when he bids them, <hi>that name the name of Christ, depart from iniquity.</hi> And for our better understanding of him we must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider that there is an iniquity that is inherent in us, and an iniquity that is apart, and at a distance from us: Now if he means, as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly he doth, that they that name the name of Christ should depart from that sin and iniquity that is in themselves: then, though he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not mean that we should separate that from our persons, for that's impossible, yet he would have us
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:48078:29"/>
take off and with-draw our minds and affections there from. And he tells us that they that are Christs do so. <hi>And they that are Christs, have cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified the flesh with the affections and lusts</hi>:<note place="margin">Gal. 5.24.</note> sinful lusts and sinful motions, our minds and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons should depart from them. There are the affections and lusts of sin: and there are the affections and lusts or desires of the soul: and again, there are the affections and lusts of the new man, in Saints. Now this is that that the Apostle would have, to wit, that the affections and passions of our souls should <hi>not chuse but depart</hi> from the affections &amp; lusts of our old man, and should be renewed and made willing to be led by the Holy Ghost from them. <hi>This I say, saies he,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vers. 16.</note> 
               <hi>walk in the spirit, and ye shall not ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil the lusts of the flesh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore when he saith, <hi>depart from iniquity,</hi> if he means, <hi>from our own inherent iniquity,</hi> then he mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t mean thus, take your mind and your affections off, carry your minds a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from them,<note place="margin">Col. 3.1.2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 3.</note> set your minds and affections upon other objects, and let your minds and affections be

yielded up to the conduct of the word and spirit of God. <hi>Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ro. 6.12.</note> 
               <hi>that ye should obey it in the lust thereof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now a man, in mind, and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, may depart from that which yet will not depart from him: yea, a man in mind, may depart from that which yet will dwell in him as long as he lives.</p>
            <p>For instance, there are many dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases that cleave to men, from which, in their minds, they <hi>willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly depart.</hi> Yea, their greatest dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietment is, that so bad a distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per will abide by them: and might they but have their desire accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished, they would be as far there from as the ends of the earth are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sunder, and while they are found to continue together, the mind de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts therefrom, and is gone either to God or to Physicians, for help, and deliverance from it.</p>
            <p>And thus it is with the Saint, and should be with every one that by way of profession <hi>nameth the name of Christ</hi>:<note place="margin">Rom. 7.</note> he should depart from his indwelling sin, with his mind: <hi>with his mind he should serve the law of God.</hi>

               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:48078:30"/>And this is an excellent thing to do, and can be done by none but such as are possessed with an excellent spirit. Ah! to find a man that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally departs from himself, and that draweth the affections of the soul, from the affections and lusts of his flesh, is a rare thing.<note place="margin">Ezek. 11.21.</note> The heart of the most of professors go after the heart of their detestable lusts, and after their inward abominations:<note place="margin">Gal. 6.8.</note> But such shall of the flesh reap corruption, notwithstanding they name the name of Christ.</p>

               <hi>But some may say, how shall I know that I do depart from the iniquity of my flesh, from the iniquity that is in me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Answ.</note>I shall answer this question briefly thus:</p>
            <p n="1">1. How <hi>is iniquity in thine eye,</hi> when severed from the guilt and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that attends it? is it as sepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from these, beauteous, or illfavoured? I ask thee how it looks, and how thou likest it, suppose there were no guilt or punishment to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend thy love to, or Commission of it. For if in its own nature it be desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to thy mind, and only therefore shunned, for fear of the punishment, that attends the Commission of it: without doubt thou art none of them that do depart from it: all that thou
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:48078:31"/>
dost, is, thou shunnest the sin, not of abhorrence of the sin, but for fear of the punishment that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends it. Like the Thief that yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuseth to take away his neighbours horse, not of hatred of theft, but for fear of the Gallows.</p>
            <p n="2">2. How <hi>dost thou like thy self,</hi> as considered possessed with a body of sin, and as feeling, and finding <hi>that</hi> sin worketh in thy members, doth this yield thee inward pleasedness of mind, and a kind of secret sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, or how? for to be sure, where a sanctified mind is,<note place="margin">Job 42.6. Ezek. 16.63. Ro. 6.12.</note> there is nothing more odious in it self, nor that makes a man so in his own eyes, as doth this sight, the sight of sin in him, of the working of lust in him. 'Tis this that makes the good man ashamed, that makes him blush, and that makes him abhor himself.</p>
            <p n="3">3. How look thy duties in thine eyes, I mean thy duties which thou doest in the service of God? I say, how look the best of these, the most warm and spiritual of these, since not one of them can be performed, but they do catch the stain of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:48078:32"/>
sin, as coming from thee? or art thou through the ignorance that is in thee as unacquainted with these things?</p>
            <p n="4">4. Why wouldest thou go to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? Is it because thou wouldest be saved from Hell, or because thou wouldest be freed from sin? I say wouldest thou go to Heaven, because 'tis a place that's Holy, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause 'tis a place remote from the pains of Hell? I ask again, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in dost thou think, the blessedness of Heaven consists? is it in the holiness that is there; or in the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom that is there from Hell? There is not a man alive but would go to Heaven, that he may be saved from Hell: but how many would go thither that they might be saved from the pleasures of sin, from the inward pleasure of sin; of that I will be silent: though surely they are those that are out of love with sin, and that do depart from ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</p>
            <p>Verily my brethren, 'tis a great thing to depart from iniquity; 'tis a great thing to have my will, my mind, and my affections departing from it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:48078:32"/>But secondly, As they that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from iniquity withdraw their minds and affections from the lusts and motions of it, so they <hi>depart also from the occasions of it</hi>;<note place="margin">Ro. 14.13. 1 Tim. 5.4. Exod. 23.7. Prov. 5.8. 2 Tim. 2.16.</note> there are occasions by which sin worketh to bring forth the fruits thereof, and some seek those <hi>occasions.</hi> But he that hath set himself to <hi>depart</hi> from sin in himself, will not seek occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from abroad, to <hi>do</hi> it. Such a man as will keep far from an evil matter, will not company with a person that pollutes and defiles, nor will he come near the door of the Adulteresses house. He will shun pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane and vain babling, for fear of the ungodliness that attends it. He will walk with wise men that he may be wise,<note place="margin">Prov. 13.20.</note> 
               <hi>knowing that a companion of fools shall be destroyed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now there are occasions given and occasions taken to sin against the Lord Jesus: but he that depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from iniquity departeth from them both. He is not for giving any occasion to others to sin; he had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wrong himself and put up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries done, than give occasion to others to do iniquity, and as he is
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:48078:33"/>
for giving none,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 5.22.</note> so neither is he for taking any. He is for partaking of no mans sins, but for keeping of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self pure.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> To depart from iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is to depart from it in those ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples that are set before us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: occasions, and examples are sometimes the same, but there may be occasions to sin, where there are no examples thereto: and therefore in that they differ. And to depart from iniquity is to shun and depart from those examples, those beastly examples that in every corner of the Country present themselvs to men.</p>
            <p>Examples to drunkenness; Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples to Whoredom; Examples to Swearing, to lying, to Stealing, to Sabbath-breaking, to Pride, to Covetousness, to Deceit, to Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie, and to what not, are now adays common among men, and he that is to seek in this matter, and that knows not how to be expertly base, may have patterns and examples thereto in every hole. But to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from iniquity, is to depart from sinful examples, to shut the eyes at
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:48078:33"/>
them, to turn the back upon them, and to cry out to Heaven for grace, to be kept in the path of life. And, <hi>let every one that nameth the name of Christ, depart from iniquity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> To depart from iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, is to depart from the <hi>enticings of iniquity.</hi> There is that in iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that is of an enticing nature. Its Pleasures, Profits, Honours, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights and sweetnesses are enticing, and he that hankers after these is not departed, nor departing from iniquity: A man must be weaned from these things, and must find some things somewhere else, that are better than these, else he cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from iniquity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But some may say I go from it and it follows me.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Quest.</note> 
               <hi>I reject it and it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns upon me. I have said it, nay a thousand times, and yet it offereth it self and its deceits to me again, what would you have me do?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I would answer thus,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> 
               <hi>Depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from iniquity,</hi> is not a work of an hour, or a day, or a week, or a month, or a year: <hi>But it's a work that will last thee thy life time</hi>; and there is the greatness and difficulty
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:48078:34"/>
of it: Were it to be done presently, or were the work to be quickly over; how many are there that would be found to have departed from ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity: but for that it is a work of continuance, and not worth any thing, unless men hold out to the end, therefore it is that so few are found actors, or overcomers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. Departing from iniquity, with many, is but like the falling out of two neighbours, they hate one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other for a while, and then renew their old friendship again</p>
            <p>But again, since to depart from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquity is a work of time, of all thy time: no wonder if it dogs thee, and offereth to return upon thee again and again: for that is mischievous and seeks nothing less than thy ruin; wherefore thou must in the first place take it for granted that thus it will be, and so cry the harder to God for the continuing of his presence, and grace upon thee in this blessed work, that as thou hast begun to call upon the name of the Lord Jesus, and begun to depart from iniquity: so thou mayest have strength to do it to the last gasp of thy life.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:48078:34"/>And further, for that departing from iniquity is a kind of a warfare with it, for iniquity will hang in thy flesh what it can, and will not be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily kept under, therefore no marvel is thou find it wearisome work, and that the thing that thou wouldest be rid of, is so unwilling to let thee depart from it.</p>
            <p>And since the work is so weighty, and that it makes thee to go groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on: I will for thy help give thee here a few things to consider of, And</p>
            <p n="1">1. Remember that God sees thee, and has his eyes open upon thee, even then when sin and temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is lying at thee to give it some entertainment. This was that that made <hi>Joseph</hi> depart from it,<note place="margin">Gen. 39.8, 7.</note> when solicited to imbrace it by a very powerful argument.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Remember that Gods wrath burns against it, and that he will surely be revenged on it, and on all that give it entertainment. This made <hi>Job</hi> afraid to countenance it, and put him upon departing from it: for destruction from God was a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:48078:35"/>
to me,<note place="margin">Job 31.23.</note> and by reason of his highness I could not endure.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Remember the mischiefs that it has done to those that have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced it, and what distress it has brought upon others. This made the whole congregation of <hi>Israel</hi> tremble to think that any of their brethren should give countenance to it.<note place="margin">Josh. 22.16, 17, 18.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Remember what Christ hath suffered by it, that he might deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver us from the power of it. This made <hi>Paul</hi> so heartily to depart from it,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.14.</note> and wish all Christians to do so as well as he.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Remember that those that are now in hell-fire went thither for that they loved iniquity,<note place="margin">Psal. 9.17. Psal. 11.6.</note> and would not depart from it.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Remember that a profession is not worth a pin,<note place="margin">Jam. 2.16, 17.</note> if they that make it do not depart from iniquity.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Remember that thy death-bed will be very uneasie to thee, if thy conscience,<note place="margin">Hos. 7.13.14.</note> at that day, shall be clogged with the guilt of thy ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</p>
            <p n="8">
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:48078:35"/>8. Remember that at the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment day Christ will say to those,<note place="margin">Luk. 13.27.</note> 
               <hi>depart from me,</hi> that have not here departed from their sin and iniquity.<note place="margin">Mat. 25.41.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly,</hi> Remember well, and think much upon what a blessed reward the Son of God will give unto them at that day, that have joyned to their profession of faith in him a holy and blessed conversation.</p>
            <p>Having thus briefly shewed you these things, I shall come in the next place to shew you,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Why some, that as to words, right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly name the name of Christ, do not depart from iniquity.</hi>
               <note place="margin">The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</note> That it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident to men to name the name of Christ religiously, and not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from iniquity: I have proved al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, and now I must shew you why it is so, and the reasons are of three sorts.</p>
            <p>First, <hi>Some profess him,</hi>
               <note place="margin">First Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</note> 
               <hi>yet have not saving faith in him, nor yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived grace from him.</hi> That some profess him that have not saith in him, nor received grace from him, I will make appear first. And then that they do not depart from
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:48078:36"/>
iniquity, shall be shewn after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
            <p>That the first is true, consider, Christ saies to his Disciples, <hi>there are some of you that believe not.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 6.46.</note> And again, <hi>For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not, and who should betray him.</hi> Now if they believe not, they have none of his grace in them: for faith is the first and head grace, the beginning and leading grace: he therefore that is destitute of that, is empty of all the rest. Besides, other Scriptures also confirm this truth. <hi>James</hi> calls some of the professors of Christ that were in his day,<note place="margin">Jam. 2.20.</note> 
               <hi>vain, or empty men</hi>; that is, men void of grace. And the Apostle suggesteth in the very words below the Text, that as in Gods house there are <hi>Golden,</hi> and <hi>Silver</hi> Saints,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 2.20.</note> so their are also <hi>earthy</hi> and <hi>Wooden</hi> ones. For in a great house as Gods is, are not only Vessels of Gold and Silver, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so <hi>of wood and of earth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 9.20.21, 22.23.</note> and some to honour, and some to dishonour; that is, some for Heaven, and some for Hell.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:48078:36"/>Now they are these <hi>Wooden,</hi> and <hi>Earthy</hi> professors that he aimeth at in the Text; to wit, that they should depart from iniquity, or else their profession would do them no good, and these also that he despaireth of in the next words, saying, But, but in this great house of God there will not only be Golden and Silver Christians, but Wooden and Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ones. And if any man purge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self <hi>from these, from these</hi> mens com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies, and from these mens vices, <hi>he shall be a vessel to honour sanctified, and meet for the Masters use, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to every good work.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From all which it is gathered that there are some that name the name of Christ in a way of profession, that have neither faith nor grace in them, and so consequently that do not depart from iniquity. For,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> These want that principle; that holy and blessed principle that should induce them thereunto; to wit, the great and principal graces of the spirit, and they are four. <hi>First,</hi> As I have said, They want faith, that heart purifying grace: for the heart is purified by faith.<note place="margin">Acts 15.9.</note> I
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:48078:37"/>
have shewed you already that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting from iniquity must be with the mind and affections, or with the heart: but how can that be, where the heart is not sanctified and made holy? For an unsanctified mind cannot depart from iniquity, no more than the <hi>Ethiopian</hi> can change his Skin;<note place="margin">Jer. 13.23.</note> but nothing can purifie the heart but faith. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore nothing can make a professor depart from iniquity where faith is wanting. So then, when men pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessedly name the name of Christ without having holy faith in him: they still abide by their iniquity: they depart not from their iniquity, but rather make of their profession, a cloak for their iniquity, for their malice,<note place="margin">1 Thes. 2.15. 1 Pet. 2.16.</note> and for their covetousness and the like. It is not <hi>profession,</hi> but <hi>faith,</hi> that bringeth God and the Soul together: and as long as God and the soul are at distance, what ever profession is made, there is not a departing, not an heart de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting from iniquity. Wherefore to these professors, <hi>James</hi> writeth thus: <hi>Draw nigh to God and he will draw nigh to you,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jam. 4.8.</note> 
               <hi>cleanse your hands,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:48078:37"/>
ye sinners, and purifie your hearts, ye dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble minded.</hi> Men, far from God, cannot think reverently of him, nor so speak and profess him, as standeth with the nature of Gospel Religion; wherefore God saith, <hi>draw near hither,</hi> that is by faith, and again,<note place="margin">Isa. 40.1.</note> 
               <hi>let them come near, then let them speak,</hi> then let them profess.<note place="margin">Heb. 11.6.</note> Without faith a man cannot please God, because he cannot without it, stand before him in the spotless righteousness of Christ, nor yet depart from iniquity and live a holy life.</p>
            <p>There are three things in Faith, that directly tend to make a man depart from iniquity.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It apprehendeth the truth of the Being, and greatness of God, and so it aweth the spirit of a man.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It apprehendeth the love of this God in Christ, and so it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quereth, and overcometh the spirit of a man.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It apprehendeth the sweetness and blessedness of the nature of the Godhead, and thence perswadeth the soul to desire <hi>here</hi> communion with him, that it may be holy, and the injoyment of him, when this world
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:48078:38"/>
is ended, that it may be happy <hi>in,</hi> and by him for ever.</p>
            <p>But without Faith these things cannot be apprehended, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore those that want it, whatever their profession is, <hi>they will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from iniquity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, Repentance,</hi> is another of the great and principal graces, which the Holy Ghost worketh in the heart: Wherefore without this also there can <hi>be no departing from iniquity.</hi> It is in vain to expect it of any man, let his profession be never so stately and great, if he is a stranger to found <hi>repentance.</hi> How many are there in our day, since the Gospel is grown so common, that catch up a notion of good things, and from that notion make a profession of the name of Christ, get into Churches, and obtain the title of a Brother, a Saint, a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of a Gospel congregation, that have clean escaped <hi>repentance.</hi> I say they have catcht up a <hi>notion</hi> of good things, and have through that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventured to name the name of Christ; quite forgetting to take <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi> with them. <hi>Repentance</hi>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:48078:38"/>
should be,<note place="margin">Mark 1.15. Pro. 3.7. chap. 16.6.</note> and is one of the <hi>first</hi> steps into true Gospel profession: but some know nothing of it, untill they come to the <hi>end</hi> of all, and <hi>their repentance</hi> will do them no good. <hi>Repentance</hi> is not, but where the true fear of God is; yea, the fear of God is one ground of <hi>repentance. Repentance</hi> is the scouring grace, 'tis that which purges. <hi>Repentance</hi> is, as I may call it, that bitter pill without the taking, and sound work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of which, base and sinful humours will rest unstirred, unpurged, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driven out of the soul. Can <hi>repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> be where godly sorrow is not? or can <hi>repentance</hi> be where the fruits of <hi>repentance</hi> are not?<note place="margin">Mark 1.4.5. Rom. 6.21. Jer. 7.3, 5.</note> O the <hi>fruits</hi> of <hi>repentance,</hi> thick sown by preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, but it comes up but thinly! Where shall the fruits of <hi>repentance</hi> be found? Confession of sin is one fruit of repentance; shame for sin, is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other fruit of repentance; amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of life, is another fruit of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nce; restitution for cousening, cheating, defrauding, beguiling thy neighbour,<note place="margin">Luk. 19.5, 6, 7, 8.</note> is another fruit of <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi>; yea, if you would see the fruits of <hi>repentance</hi> as described by
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:48078:39"/>
the Holy Ghost, and put together for the further conviction and shame of the impenitent professor; look into the Second Epistle, to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> Chapter 7. vers. 9, 10, 11.</p>
            <p>But this is a day that was never read of, a day wherein <hi>conversion</hi> is frequent, without <hi>repentance</hi>; such a conversion as 'tis, and therefore doth the Church of God now swarm with them, that religiously name the name of Christ, &amp; <hi>yet depart not from iniquity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Alas! all Houses, all Tables, all Shops, have hanging up in them, <hi>the sign of the want of repentance.</hi> To say nothing of the talk, of the beds, and the backs of most that profess:<note place="margin">Eccles. 7.27, 28.</note> by which of these is it that one of a thousand for Men; and for Women, one of ten thousand do shew that they have repentance? No mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel then that the name of Christ is so frequently mentioned there, where iniquity dwells, yea, reigns, and that with the consent of the mind.</p>
            <p>I would not be <hi>austere,</hi> but were <hi>wearing</hi> of Gold, <hi>putting on</hi> of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel, <hi>dressing up</hi> houses, <hi>decking</hi> of children, <hi>learning</hi> of complements, <hi>boldness</hi> in women, <hi>letchery</hi> in men,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:48078:39"/>
               <hi>wanton</hi> behaviours, lascivious words, and tempting carriages, signs of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance: then I must say, the fruits of repentance swarm in our Land: but if these be none of the fruits of repentance then, O, the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of professors, that religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously name the name of Christ, and do not depart from iniquity. But,</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>Thirdly, Love</hi> is another of those great and principal graces, which the H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ly Ghost worketh in the heart: wherefore let profession be never so high, yet if <hi>Love</hi> be wanting there, to be sure such pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors <hi>depart not from iniquity.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.</note> Hence all profession, and subjecting to profession are counted nothing, where love is not. Love is coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a most infallible sign that a man is in a state of Salvation. <hi>He that loveth dwells in God, is born of God, and knoweth him.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Joh. 4.7, 16, 21.</note> Love divideth it self to God, and to my Neighbour. Love to God, is, that we keep his savings, his commandments, his Laws. <hi>If a man love me,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>he will keep my words; and he that loveth me not, keepeth not my sayings.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 14.23, 24.</note> 
               <hi>For this is the love of God, that we keep his

commandments, and his commandments are not grievous.</hi> So then, that profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor that hath not love, <hi>cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from iniquity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">

            <p n="2">2. Where no love is, men cannot deny themselves of that, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise they might lawfully do, lest the weak should fall, and the world be destroyed.<note place="margin">Rom. 14.15. Psal. 97.10.</note>

            <p n="3">3. Where love to God is, there is hatred against iniquity; <hi>ye that love the Lord, hate evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A man cannot love God, that loves not holiness; he loves not holiness, that loves not Gods word; he loves not Gods word, that doth not do it: It is a common thing to find men par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial in Gods Law, setting much by small things, and neglect<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>To speak nothing of the <hi>first</hi> Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, where is he that hath his love manifested by the second? where are they that feed the hungry, and cloath the naked, and send porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to them, for whom nothing is prepared?

Love! love is gone, and now coveting, pinching, griping and such things are in fashion; now iniquity abounds, instead of grace, in many that name the name of Christ.

            <p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:48078:41"/>
               <hi>Fourthly, Hope</hi> is another of those great and principal graces, which the Holy Ghost worketh in the heart, and without which let a man be never so high in profession, and so open in naming the name of Christ, he cannot <hi>depart from iniquity.</hi> As was said before of faith, so we say now of hope.<note place="margin">1 Joh. 3.3.</note> 
               <hi>And every one that hath this hope in him, purifieth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self as he is pure.</hi> Here is that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent office, or rather effect of hope made manifest, it purifieth, it cleans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a man; it makes him make the Lord Jesus his example, as well as his Saviour. He purifieth himself even as he is pure; to wit, in soul, in body, in spirit, in life and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation. Hope of life eternal by Christ, makes a man purifie himself in obeying the truth through the spirit. Hope to be with Christ hereafter, will make me strive to believe him here. Hope of being with Angels then, will make a man strive to live like an Angel here. Alas! alas! there is a company of <hi>half-priests</hi> in the world, and they cannot, they dare not teach the people the whole counsel of God,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:48078:41"/>
because in so doing they will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn themselves and their manner of living in the world: where is that Minister now to be found that dare say to his people, look on me, and walk as you have me for an example? or that dare say, what you see and hear to be in me, do, <hi>and the God of peace shall be with you.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Philip. 3.17. chap. 4.9.</note> These men had hope, and hope puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied them to an example, till they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came patterns to others: Is not this now far off from some professors in the world, are they purified, are they clean that name the name of Christ? are they weaned from that milk, and drawn from the breasts. No, nor their profession is not attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with grace; they name the name of Christ; well, but they do not depart from iniquity. Let a man believe a lie, and according to the reality of his belief, such will his obedience be; let a man hope for that, for which he hath no ground to hope, yet his hope will work with him according to the power thereof: And yet we have a generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of men that profest the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Gospel, which yieldeth the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:48078:42"/>
most substantial ground for faith and hope: yea, we have a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of men that will be naming the name Christ, which is the sweetest, the most taking, and desirable name that is named among the sons of men, and for all that, this Gospel, this worthy name, nor yet their naming of it, doth make them depart from iniquity. But whats the reason? why, they have taken up a profession, but want the Grace of Christ; the Faith, the Repentance, the Love and hope of the Gospel. No marvel then, if they abide among the wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en sort of professors: No marvel then, though the iniquity of their heels still follows them, and that it drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth from them whereever they go. But so much for the first reason, Why men do name the name of Christ and yet do not depart from iniquity.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Second reason.</note>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The second reason, why some that name the name of Christ, depart not from iniquity, is, <hi>for that, though they rest not in bare no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as those forementioned, yet they take up as they, short of the saving grace of God.</hi> There are bare no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, there are common workings,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:48078:42"/>
and there is a work that is saving, and that will do the soul good to eternity.</p>
            <p n="1">1. There are <hi>bare</hi> notions,<note place="margin">1 Thes. 1.5. 1 Cor. 4.19, 20.</note> and they that have them, are such unto whom the Gospel comes in <hi>word only</hi>; such whose Religion stands <hi>in word only,</hi> and is not attended with a power sutable: that is, there goeth not along with the word, a power sufficient to subdue, and work over the heart to a cordial, and gracious close with that word that comes to them. Yet such is the noise, and sound of the word that they are willing to become pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors thereof; there is some kind of musicalness in it, specially, when well handled and fingered by a skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful preacher. <hi>And lo,</hi> saith God unto such preachers, when their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditory is made up of such kind of hearers, <hi>And lo,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ezek. 33.30, 31, 32.</note> 
               <hi>thou art unto them as a very lovely Song</hi> (or as one that sings a Song of Loves) <hi>of one that hath a pleasant voice, and can play well on an instrument: For they hear thy words but they do them not.</hi>

Of these we read in several places; to wit, that they have tasted <hi>of the powers of the world to come</hi>; but not so as to bring them safe to glory. Yet thus far they go.</p>

            <p>Thus, I say, it is with some profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors, who yet cannot be said to depart from iniquity, that is, for all ado, because the things that now are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, abide with them but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while. <hi>For awhile,</hi> they believe;<note place="margin">Luk. 8.13. Joh. 5.35. 2 Pet. 2.11</note> they rejoyce in the light <hi>for a season.</hi> So they clean escape from them, who live in error <hi>for a little,</hi> or <hi>awhile</hi>; and after that return to their old course, and are again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled with their inquities and overcome. This is called, <hi>A turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the Dog to his own vomit again, and with the Sow that was wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to her wallowing in the mire.</hi> And some of these are set forth by this and such like sayings.<note place="margin">Mat. 12.43, 44, 45,</note>

Indeed there seems to be a subjection of the will, and an overruling of the mind, and affections also, else they could not for a time lay aside their iniquity, come off from the pollutions of the world, and

for a season rejoyce in the word and be pleased with the light there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. But we may consider, that this may be, not for that a sound work of God hath passed upon these powers of the soul, but that rather this was by reason of those reflex acts, that the understanding <hi>now</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened, the judgment <hi>now</hi> inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the conscience <hi>now</hi> convinced, had upon these other powers of the soul. And I the rather think it so, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause willingness, mindfulness of, and affection for this Gospel, lasted no longer than the light shined in their understandings, or than the things were relished by their judgment and conscience. So that when the light of their Candle went out, and when the taste of this sugar-plumb was out of their mouth, their wills and affections, not being possessed with the fear of God, they returned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to their course, and went away as before with iniquity.</p>

            <p n="2">2. Besides, Gods withdrawing, to wit, of those common workings, if they were withdrawn without a cause given, (which yet I question) yet why may they not be withdrawn from these, as well as from his own peculiar ones. He knows but little, that doth not know that God oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times hides his face from his own, and also withdraws from them the light and great influences of the Holy Ghost: and turns them over at least in their own apprehensions to the ungodly, and to fallen An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels for their Chastisement, or Tryal, or Instruction, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>But we will let these things pass, and call you again to a remembrance of what is in hand: we are now shewing that there be them that name the name of Christ, <hi>that yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part not from iniquity,</hi> and in shewing the cause of their not so doing, one was for that the Gospel came to them in word only; and the other was for that though it came to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in power, yet not in power, or in <hi>that</hi> power, that effectually keepeth some to salvation. Upon this second reason I now am, and am shewing how it comes to pass that they that are under the power of the things that we have afore dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed, should notwithstanding that return to their vomit again. One cause of this declension, or going back to iniquity I have just now touched upon, and we have some more behind.</p>

            <p>'Tis marvelous to see how some men are captivated with this <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulness.</hi> Those that sometimes have prayed, cryed, groaned, and sigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for eternal life: Those that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times thought no pains too much, no way too far, no hazzards too great to run for eternal life; those who sometimes were captivated with the word, and with the comforts and joy thereof, and that, had it been possible, could have pulled out their eyes,<note place="margin">Gal. 4.14.15.</note> and have given them to a Gospel Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, so dear, and sweet were the good tidings which they brought to such.</p>
            <p>I say 'tis marvelous to see how such men are captivated with the <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulness</hi> of this. They are as if they never had been <hi>them</hi> men; they are, as if they never had had such things; or as if they had never had
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:48078:49"/>
thought about them. Yea, they are <hi>strange,</hi> and carry it <hi>strangely</hi> to all those that still are under the power of that word, and of that mighty hand, by which sometimes themselves were guided.</p>
            <p>Should one say to some, Art not thou the man that I once saw cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under a Sermon, that I once heard cry out, what must I do to be saved, and that sometime ago I heard speak well of the holy word of God: how askew will they look upon one; or if they will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that such things were with them once, they do it more like images and rejected Ghosts, than men. They look as if they were blasted, withered,<note place="margin">Joh. 15.</note> cast out and dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to powder, and now fit for nothing, but to be cast into the fire, and burned. The godliness from which they are departed, and the iniquity unto which again they have joyned themselves, has so altered, so <hi>metamorphosed,</hi> and changed their heart, and mind, and ways. This therefore is the second thing which shews why some that have been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der something of the power of
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:48078:50"/>
things, are again with iniquity, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled and overcome.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Another thing that makes these enlightened ones that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue not to depart from iniquity, is the persecution that always at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends the word: for persecution al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways attends the word, that of the <hi>Tongue,</hi> or that of the <hi>Sword</hi>: Now these men that were once enlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, though they cannot remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber what they were themselves, yet Satan helps them to think that their neighbours remember what they were: and having now lost the savor, the sence of what they once had, and sinned away that spirit that brought it to them, they grow weak; ye are above all men the most unable to stand up, to abide the shock, and tryal, that for their profession is coming upon them. Wherefore,<note place="margin">Mat. 4.16, 17. Luk. 8.13.</note> 
               <hi>by and by they are offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>; to wit, with their own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, and call themselves an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred fools, for being so heedless, so witless, and unwary to mind Gods holy things, in such a time and day. Then they bethink with themselves how to make an honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:48078:50"/>
retreat, which they suppose they usually do, by finding fault first with their own unadvisedness, and of the over-perswasiveness of others; they also now begin to say farewel conscience, yea, God and Heaven and all, and joyn in confederacy with the world again. Thus are they in fear, where no fear is; and the sound of a shaken leaf doth chase them. And there are four things are the cause of this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> For that, notwithstanding the former power that attended the word to their hearts, their hearts did still abide as hard as a rock, there was no true and sound break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, nor softning in that: wherefore there the word wanted depth of earth, as our Lord is pleased to call it; and anon when the Sun was up, that which remained was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently scorched, and so withered away.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Notwithstanding what they had sometimes injoyed, yet the grace of the fear of God was want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in them; so wanting,<note place="margin">Eccl. 7.16, 17, 18.</note> that what should hinder but that they should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to go as they came, and leave
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:48078:51"/>
Christ, the Gospel, and the people of God to shift as well as they can for themselves.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 78.30, 36, 37.</note>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> All that they injoyed did not estrange their heart from their lusts, though when they were in the power of things they were deader to them than formerly; I say than formerly: And it is even with such, as with them, who are for a time taken off from what yet they love, by some new imploy in which they are ingaged. <hi>Saul</hi> went out to look for <hi>David</hi> to kill him, but when he came at <hi>Naioth</hi> in <hi>Ramah,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Sam. 19.18.24.</note> the spirit of God came upon him and he prophesied. But this lasted but for a while, <hi>Saul</hi> soon returned to his old envy against the holy man again.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> It comes upon them even of judgment and wrath, for since they so soon give way to sin, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get, God suffereth them to fall into fear of men, and to force their hearts to comply with bad things, even as <hi>Judas</hi> and <hi>Demas</hi> did; till they are swallowed up of that Gulph, into which the ungodly descend. <hi>As for such</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 125.5.</note> 
               <hi>as turn aside unto their own crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:48078:51"/>
ways the Lord shall lead them forth with the workers of iniquity.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 125.5.</note>
            </p>
            <p>When once God is angry with a people; He can deal with them, He can give them up to those lusts in judgment, that they will not be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from by mercy. Yea, he can make a way for his anger to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take them that have made a way by the deceits of their hearts, to go a Whoring from under him.</p>
            <p>And these are the causes, why those that were once inlightned and have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come, return with the Dog to his own Vomit again, and so though they have or do name the name of Christ, yet depart not from ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> A third Reason, why they that name the name of Christ,<note place="margin">The third reason.</note> do not depart from iniquity, may be, because Grace is weak, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption strong. I speak now of them that are truly gracious: for as those that never had nothing but notion, did <hi>never at all</hi> depart from iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and as those that never had sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving grace, though common work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:48078:52"/>
were with them, do <hi>but a little depart from iniquity</hi>: so those that yet have the grace of God in them, in truth, do not, <hi>as they should, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from iniquity</hi>: wherefore the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation is as much to them as it is to any body else; <hi>And let them that name the name of Christ, with gracious lips, depart from iniquity.</hi> For though there is a great difference 'twixt these, and the two sorts that I mentioned before, these having the true principles of holiness in them; but the other nothing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: yet they, even they, also have need of this exhortation: for they do not as they should, depart from iniquity. Their graces as I said are weak, and that is the reason thereof.</p>
            <p>That these do not depart from iniquity as they should, is clear.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For that their highest acts of holiness,<note place="margin">Isa. 64.6. Psal. 143.2. Heb. 13.15. Mat. 6.12.</note> are tainted therewith, and made imperfect thereby: this is manif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>st, because they s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ill are afraid to shew themselves before God in their own works, and because they betake them for acceptation with God, to the Priestly Office of Christ,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:48078:52"/>
and pray by him, <hi>Forgive us our trespasses.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. This is clear also,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 3.18. Heb. 6.12. Phil. 3.12, 13, 14. 2 Cor. 7.1.</note> because we are, while in this world, no where by the word, said to have attained to the mark and point of absolute perfection; but are bid to grow, to follow on, to press forward, and to perfect holiness in the fear of God. Yea, the best of us all, even the Apostles and Prophets, have not only made it manifest by their <hi>imperfections,</hi> that as yet they have not departed from iniquity, as they should; but they have confessed, and denyed not, that they were yet in the pursuit of righteousness, and had not already attained.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This is clear also, for that the righteousness, by the which the best of Saints are justified in the sight of God, is a righteousness of another, not their own; the righteousness of another man, for that there is not any upon earth that doth good and sins not. And what need we pray, <hi>forgive us our trespasses,</hi> approach God in the perf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ctions of another, and be bid to perfect holiness, if we had already attained, or were already
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:48078:53"/>
perfect, or were so departed from iniquity as we should?</p>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, the complaints of God concerning this matter doth suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently testifie the truth of what I say. When God came to his people in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and bid them forsake the Idols of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> they did not. But they rebelled against me, says he, and would not hearken unto me: they did not, every man, cast away the abominations of his eyes, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did they forsake the Idols of <hi>Aegypt.</hi> Well, He saved them out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and brought them into the Wilderness, and said to them there, Obey my Laws and my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments; But the House of <hi>Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi> rebelled against me in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness, they walked not in my Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, they despised my judgments. Well, then he had them from the Wilderness to <hi>Canaan,</hi> and then said to them,<note place="margin">Ezek. 20.</note> Keep my Laws. But when he had brought them into the Land, then they also polluted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and sinned against him as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:48078:53"/>Again,<note place="margin">Hag. 2.14·</note> when God brought them out of captivity, both they and every thing that they did was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean.</p>
            <p>To be short,<note place="margin">Jam. 3.2. 1 Jo. 1.9.</note> what says <hi>Paul</hi> in the seventh to the Romans? what says <hi>James</hi> in the third Chapter of his Epistle? And what says <hi>John</hi> in his first Epistle, and first Chapter? Do they not all confess, though themselves were Apostles, and so for Grace and Gifts beyond any that breath in this world, that sin and iniquity was yet with them; and so consequently that there was not as yet, that departing by them, therefrom, as there should.</p>
            <p>And the reason, as I have said, is because grace is weak, weak in the best and most strong of the Saints of God. Hence the greatest Saints use to complain, when much assaulted with corruptions, or attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with very hard service for God, of their weakness, and insufficiency, as to a compleatness of doing the will of God.</p>

               <hi>or is my flesh brass</hi>? And again, <hi>Am I a Sea, or a Whale, that thou settest a watch over me? Wilt thou break a leaf driven to and fro? And wilt thou pursue the dry stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>?</p>
            <p n="3">3. So <hi>Daniel,</hi> when he was but to stand and talk with the Angel, how weak did he find himself; <hi>There remained,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Dan. 10.</note> saith he, <hi>no strength in me; and, O my Lord, by the vision my sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows are turned upon me, and I have retained no strength. For how can the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:48078:54"/>
servant of this my Lord, talk with this my Lord? for as for me, straight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way there remaineth no strength in me, neither is breath left in me.</hi> Some may say, but this is natural weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. But I ask, how came nature to be so weak, but through sin? the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains whereof abiding still upon the best of Saints, make them, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding their graces, unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to do any thing as they should.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Paul,</hi> a man of men, who had so much Grace, revelation of grace, and Communion with Christ, that sometimes he knew not whether he was <hi>in</hi> or <hi>out</hi> of the body, and yet you find him making bitter com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of the weakness of his grace, and of the power of his corruptions. <hi>I am Carnal,</hi> saith he, <hi>and what I hate, that do I. How to perform that which is good I find not; when I would do good, evil is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent with me.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 7.</note> 
               <hi>But I see another Law in my members, warring against the Law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the Law of sin, which is in my members. O wretched man that I am, &amp;c.</hi> What complaints, what
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:48078:55"/>
confessions, what bewailings of weakness is here? And what need was there of any of this, if <hi>Paul</hi> could, as he would, have departed from iniquity?</p>
            <p>I have instanced in these four men, because as to failings and miscarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages, they are as free (by what the holy record saith) as any four of whose lives you shall read in all the Bible: but you see that they were too weak to do, and depart from iniquity as they would.</p>
            <p>Grace may be said to be weak, either when a lower or less degree thereof, is compared with a higher and greater degree of the same; or it may be said to be weak when, in what degree of it you will, it shall be ingaged by, or ingage it self against sin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. There are degrees of grace in the world: some have less, and some bigger measures thereof, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the measure of grace recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, so is a Christian capable of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. He that has little, acts but weakly; he that has much, acts more strongly; and he of the Saints that has most, acteth best of all: but yet
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:48078:55"/>
none of these three can act so as they should and would, and, conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, so depart from iniquity as is their duty. Witness those four that I mentioned but now, for they are among the first rate of Saints, yet you see what they did, and hear what they said.</p>
            <p>Sin is a mighty Tyrant: it is also installed in our flesh, and has more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over that in it which suiteth with what ever is sensual in us: The flesh relisheth it well, though the spirit of the Christian is against it.</p>
            <p>Sin is an Active beast, and will not admit that the soul should at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to put forth it self in any good thing, without opposition, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction. When I should do good, evil is present with me.</p>
            <p>Sin is of a polluting and defiling nature; and what grace soever it toucheth, it staineth, and in staining, makes it weaker, than were it not so defiled it would be. Besides, not a grace, nor an act of grace in the soul can escape untouched.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vnbelief</hi> stands ready to annoy faith in the grace, as well as in the act of faith.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:48078:56"/>
               <hi>Hardness of heart</hi> will not let love so affectionately, and sympathising<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly act as it should.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sence and reason</hi> being polluted, will not let hope be so stedfastly fixed upon unseen things as it should.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pride</hi> will not let us be so humble as we ought; nor <hi>self,</hi> so <hi>self deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: passion</hi> often interrupts our <hi>patience,</hi> and <hi>angry</hi> motions our <hi>meekness.</hi> By these and more that might be named, it appears that sin is in us, opposeth our graces, and letteth them from acting as they should. And because this sin has part of our self in its possession; therefore, though our more noble part be utterly against it, yet we depart not from it as we should.</p>

               <note place="margin">Numb. 20.12. Psal. 106.32. Job 38.2. chap. 42.6. Dan. 4.8. Rom. 7.24.</note>God chargeth <hi>Moses</hi> with rash and unadvised words, and so he doth <hi>Job</hi> also: <hi>Daniel</hi> did wear the name of an Idol God; and <hi>Paul</hi> freely confesseth himself unfirm.</p>
            <p>Nor may what hath now been said, be applied to those that are weak in faith, and so in every other grace; for the strongest grace when acted as well as we can, cannot cause
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:48078:56"/>
that we depart from iniquity as we should.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Because the strongest grace, cannot act without opposition.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Because we that are the actors are lame, infirm, and made weak by sin that dwells in us.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Because grace and a state of grace, is not that wherein the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection designed for us doth lie; for that is in another world.</p>
            <p n="1">1. This is a place to act faith in.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This a place to labour and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel in.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This is a place to fight and wrestle in.</p>
            <p n="4">4. This is a place to be tryed in.</p>
            <p>And therefore this is no place of perfection, and consequently no place, where Gods people can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from iniquity as they should.</p>
            <p>Now there is a twofold way of departing from iniquity.</p>
            <p n="1">1. One is when the mind is set against it, and withdrawn from the love and liking of it.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:48078:57"/>2. The other is when the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of it is shunned by the whole man.</p>
            <p>The first of these ways, the Saints though they truly do depart from iniquity, yet depart not from it as they should.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Their understanding sees not the utmost baseness that is in it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Their judgment is not infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med about the vileness of it to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The conscience has not yet been convinced of all the evil that is in it. Then,</p>
            <p n="1">1. How should the soul abhor it as it should.</p>
            <p n="2">2. How should the desires depart from it, with that fervency as they should.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And the will and affections so turn away from it as they should.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> As to the shunning of the acts of sin, there we also come wonderful short.</p>
            <p>We shun not the sins of others as we should: This is made appear,</p>
            <p n="1">1. For that we shun not the company of base men as we should.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:48078:57"/>2. Nor shun or refuse to imitate them in their evil, as we should. How easily are good men perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to comply with bad mens ways: Yea, <hi>Jehosaphat</hi> himself said to <hi>Ahab</hi> that base one; <hi>Behold,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Kings 22.4.</note> 
               <hi>I am as thou art, my people as thy people, my horses as thy horse. Joseph</hi> could learn in <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Court,<note place="margin">Gen. 42.15, 16. Gal. 2.11, 12, 13 14.</note> to swear by <hi>Pharoahs</hi> life. <hi>Peter</hi> also when dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling was in fashion among the people, could learn to dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble likewise.</p>
            <p>We shun not our own sins, or the sins of our own company as we should.</p>
            <p>Christians learn to be proud one of another; to be covetous one of another; to be treacherous and false one of another; to be cowardly in Gods matters one of another; to be remiss and negligent in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian duties one of another.</p>
            <p>Besides, If I should go about to shew here,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 12.12. Exod. 32.22, 23, 24. Judg. 6.29, 30, 31.</note> how Christians will hide iniquity, as <hi>David</hi>; how they will excuse it, as did <hi>Aaron,</hi> how they will plead for it, as did the men of the City of <hi>Joash</hi> for <hi>Baal,</hi> and the like, I might soon make it abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly

               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:48078:59"/>
appear, that Christians do not depart from iniquity as they should. And therefore the exhortation stands good, and of use to the best of Saints on earth, <hi>that they and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of them should depart from ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</hi> Yea, the observation also that they do not do it as they should, doth still stand good against us.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, as it is true in those that have nothing but notion, and that it is true in those that are wrought upon, but not effectually: so it is true, upon those that are truly gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious; observation, proves it fears; of damnation prove it; the outcry of the world, proves it; and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of the best men, proves it.</p>
            <p>I come now to another observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, with which I will present you, and that is this, namely, <hi>that every one that in way of profession and religion names the name of Christ, should depart from iniquity.</hi> I say, that every one that in a way of profession and Religion, nam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the name of Christ, should depart from iniquity. This truth needs more <hi>practice</hi> than <hi>proof</hi>: For I think there are none that have ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Scripture or reason by them,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:48078:59"/>
but will freely consent to this.</p>
            <p>Nor is there any thing ambiguous in the observation that we need <hi>now</hi> to stand upon the explaining of. For,</p>
            <p>What iniquity is, who knows not?</p>
            <p>That it cleaves to the best, who knows not?</p>
            <p>That it is disgraceful to professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who knows not? and therefore that it ought to be departed from, who knows not?</p>
            <p>But because the motives in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular may not be so much considered as they ought, and because 'tis Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans design to tempt us to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy, and to keep iniquity and the professing man together: therefore I will in this place spend some ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments upon you that profess, and in a way of profession do name the name of Christ, that you depart from iniquity; to wit, both in the inward thought, and in the outward practice of it. And those argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments shall be of four sorts, some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specting Christ, some his Father, some our selves, and some the World.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> The Christ, whom you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, whose name you name, and whose Disciples you pretend to be,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:48078:60"/>
is holy.<note place="margin">Heb. 7.26.</note> 
               <hi>Be ye holy, for I am holy.</hi> This is natural to our discourse: for if Christ be holy, and if we profess him, and in professing of him, declare that we are his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, we ought therefore to depart from iniquity, that we may shew the truth of our profession to the world.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> They that thus name the name of Christ, should depart from iniquity, because <hi>This Christ,</hi> whose name we name, <hi>is loving.</hi> Those that have a loving Master, a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster that is continually extending his love unto his Servants, should be forward in doing of his will, that thereby they may shew their sence, and acceptation of the love of their Master. Why, this is his will, that we depart from iniquity, that we throw sin away:<note place="margin">1 Thes. 5.22.</note> that we fly every appearance of evil.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> They that thus name the name of Christ should depart from iniquity, <hi>Because of the honour and reputation of their Lord.</hi> 'Tis a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paragement <hi>to Christ,</hi> that any of his servants, and that any that name his name, should yet abide by, and
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:48078:60"/>
continue with iniquity.<note place="margin">Mal. 1.6.</note> 
               <hi>A son ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>noureth his Father, and a servant his Master: If then I be a Father, where is mine honour? and if I be a Master, where is my fear? saith the Lord of Hosts, unto you, O Priests, that despise my name? and ye say, wherein have we despised thy name.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> They that name the name of Christ should depart from iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>because of his name,</hi> that his name may not be evil spoken of by men: for our holiness puts a lustre and a beauty upon the name of Christ, and our <hi>not</hi> departing from iniquity draws a cloud upon it. Wherefore we ought to depart from iniquity, that the name of the Lord Jesus may be glorified, and not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached through us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> They that name the name of Christ should depart from ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, <hi>because of the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ.</hi> That the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of our Lord Jesus Christ, which they profess, may not be evil spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of by our neighbours. The Gospel is called <hi>holy</hi>;<note place="margin">2 Pet. 2.21.</note> therefore let them be holy that profess it: The which they can by no means be, if they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:48078:61"/>
not from iniquity. Men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not serve the designs of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and their own worldly and fleshly designs. But they that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess the name of Christ, they should be tender of his Gospel, that they keep that in good esteem and repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in the world. The which they can by no means do, unless they depart from iniquity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> They that name the name of Christ should depart from iniquity, <hi>Because the very profession of that name is holy.</hi> The profession; is an holy profession. <hi>Be ye clean that bear the vessels of the Lord</hi>: The vessels, that is, the profession for by that, is as it were, carried about the name, and Gospel of Jesus Christ. We must therefore lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side all iniquity, and superfluity of naughtiness, and do as persons pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing Godliness, as professing a profession,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 2.10. Heb. 3.1.</note> that Christ is the Priest of, the High-Priest of. It is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to any man to be but a bungle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> at his profession, to be but a sloven in his profession. And it is the honour of a man to be excellent in the managing of his
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:48078:61"/>
profession. Christians should be excellent in the managment of their profession, and should make that which is good in it self, good to the Church and to the world, by a sweet and cleanly managing of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly,</hi> They that profess the name of Christ, or that name it religiously, should to their utmost depart from iniquity, <hi>because of the Church of Christ which is holy.</hi> He that religiously professeth the name of Christ, has put himself into the Church of Christ, though not into a particular one, yet into the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal one. Now that is holy. What agreement then hath the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God with Idols? I, or any Pillar, or Post, or Pin,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 6.16.</note> or mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of that temple. One black sheep is quickly espied among five hundred white ones, and one man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie one will soon infect many. One also among the Saints, that is not clean, is a blemish to the rest, and, as <hi>Solomon</hi> says,<note place="margin">Eccl. 9.18.</note> 
               <hi>one sinner destroyeth much good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:48078:62"/>
               <hi>Eightly,</hi> They that profess the name of Christ, or that name that name religiously, should depart from iniquity, <hi>Because of the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of Christ, for they are holy.</hi> Men of old before they went in to meddle with holy things,<note place="margin">Exod. 30.17, 18.19.20.21.</note> were to wash their hands and their feet in a vessel prepared for that purpose. Now since they that name that name religiously do also meddle with Christs appointments, they must al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so wash and be clean: cleanse your hands ye sinners if you mean to meddle with Christ in his appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: Wash lest God cut you off for your not departing from ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ninthly,</hi> They that name the name of Christ religiously, should depart from iniquity, <hi>because of Christs observers.</hi> There ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> many that keep their eye upon Christ, and that watch for an opportunity to speak against him even through the sides of those that profess him. <hi>Behold,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 2.34.</note> 
               <hi>this child is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel: And for a sign that shall be spoken against.</hi> Some take occasion to
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:48078:62"/>
speak against him, because of the meanness of his person; here some again speak against him, because of the plainness of his doctrine; also some speak against him, because of the meanness of his followers; and some speak against him, because of the evil deeds of some that profess him. But if he that gives just oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of offence to the least of Saints had better be drowned in the Sea with a Mill-stone about his neck: what think you, shall his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be, who, through his mingling of his profession of Christs name, with a wicked life shall tempt or provoke men to speak a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Christ?</p>
            <p>I come now to those arguments that respect God the Father.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Then, they that profess the name of Christ should depart from iniquity; <hi>because of God the Father,</hi> because God the Father <hi>has made Christ to be to us what he is</hi>; to wit, the Apostle and High-Priest of our profession.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.30. Joh. 5.23. chap. 15.8.</note> 
               <hi>He that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noureth not the Son, honoureth not the Father, which hath sent him.</hi> Nor can the Father be honoured by us,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:48078:63"/>
but by our departing from iniquity. All our talk and profession of Christ, adds no glory to his Father, who has made him our King, and Priest, and Prophet: if it be not joyned to an holy conversation. Wherefore, if you profess the name of Christ, and would hold the word in hand, that you have believed in him, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from iniquity, for the Fathers sake that hath sent him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> As it is the Father which has made Christ to us what he is; so it is the Father, who hath called us to partake of Christ and all his benefits:<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.9. Heb. 3.14.</note> 
               <hi>Wherefore we must depart from iniquity,</hi> that profess the name of Christ, that we may glorifie him <hi>for his call.</hi> He has called us to the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ; That is, to partake of all that good that is in him, as Mediator, and to be done by him for those that trust in him. Nor had we ever come out of a cursed and condemned condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to Christ for life and blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, but by the call of the Father; For 'tis <hi>not of works,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 9.10, 11.</note> 
               <hi>but of him that calleth: now since he has called us</hi> to this priviledge, [even us whom he has
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:48078:63"/>
called] and left others in their sins to perish by his judgments,<note place="margin">Heb. 3.1. 2 Pet. 1.2, 3.</note> it is meet, we should depart from ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity. Specially since the call by which he called us, is heavenly, and holy, and because he has not only called us to <hi>glory,</hi> but to <hi>vertue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We that religiously name the name of Christ, should depart from iniquity, because God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of our Lord Jesus Christ has commanded us so to do. Wherefore gird up the loyns of your minds, be sober, and hope to the end, for the grace that is to be brought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ. As obedient Children, not fashioning your selves according to your former lusts in your ignorance; but as he that has called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation: Because it is written, <hi>Be ye holy, as I am holy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> They that religiously name the name of Christ, should depart from iniquity, that they may answer the end for which they are called to profess his name. The Father has therefore called them to profess his name, <hi>that</hi> they might be
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:48078:64"/>
trees of righteousness, the planting of the Lord, that he might be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified. Dost thou then profess the name of Christ; bring forth those fruits that become that holy profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, that you may be called trees of righteousness, and that God may be glorified for, and by your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed subjection to the Gospel of his Son.<note place="margin">Isa. 61.3.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> They that name (as afore) the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, should depart from iniquity, <hi>that they may shew to the world the nature and power of those graces, which God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther has bestowed upon them that do reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giously name the name of Christ.</hi> And the rather, because, he that religiously nameth that name, declareth even by his so naming of him, that he has received grace of the Father, to enable him so to do. Now he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not declare this by deeds, unless he depart from iniquity:<note place="margin">Tit. 1.16.</note> and his decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of it by words alone signifies lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to God or man.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> We therefore that reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giously name the name of Christ, should also depart from iniquity; because the spirit of the Father will
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:48078:64"/>
else be grieved.<note place="margin">Eph. 4.30.</note> The countenancing of iniquity; the not departing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from, will grieve the holy spirit of God, by which you are sealed to the day of redemption: and that is a sin of an higher nature than men com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly are aware of. He that griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the spirit of God shall smart for it here, or in Hell, or both. And that spirit that sometimes did illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate, teach and instruct them, can keep silence, can cause dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, can withdraw it self, and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the soul to sin more and more; and this last is the very judgment of Judgments.<note place="margin">1 Thes. 5.19.</note> He that <hi>grieves</hi> the spirit, <hi>quenches</hi> it; and he that <hi>quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi> it, <hi>vexes</hi> it; and he that <hi>vexes</hi> it, sets it against himself, and tempts it to hasten destruction upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. Wherefore take heed, professors,<note place="margin">Isa. 63.10. Acts 5.9.</note> I say take heed, you that religiously name the name of Christ, that you meddle not with iniquity, that you tempt not the spirit of the Lord to do such things against you, whose beginnings are dreadful, and whose end in working of judgments is unsearchable. A man knows not whither he is going, nor where he
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:48078:65"/>
shall stop, that is but entring into temptation; nor whether he shall ever turn back, or go out at the gap that is right before him. He that has begun to grieve the Holy Ghost, may be suffered to go on untill he has sinned <hi>that</hi> sin which is called <hi>the</hi> Sin against the Holy Ghost. And if God shall once give thee up to <hi>that,</hi> then thou art in the Iron cage, out of which there is neither deliverance nor redemption. <hi>Let eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one therefore that nameth the name of Christ, depart from iniquity,</hi> upon this second consideration.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> In the next place, I come now to those arguments that do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect thy self.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Those that religiously name the name of Christ should, must depart from iniquity, because else our profession of him is but a lie.<note place="margin">1 Joh. 1.6.</note> 
               <hi>If we say we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie.</hi> And walk in darkness: that is, and walk in iniquity, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from a life that is according to the course of this World. <hi>He that saith,</hi>
               <note place="margin">chap. 2  4.</note> 
               <hi>I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a lyer, and the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:48078:65"/>
truth is not in him</hi>: The truth that he professes to know, and that he saith he hath experience of, is not in him.<note place="margin">1 King. 17.24.</note> Every man that nameth the name of Christ, is not therefore a man of God, nor is the word in every mans mouth, truth; though he makes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of that worthy name. It is then truth <hi>in</hi> him, and <hi>to</hi> others with reference <hi>to him,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. 2.2, 9. chap. 3.9.</note> when his mouth and his life shall agree. Men may say they are Apostles, and be lyers: they may say, they are <hi>Jews,</hi> that is Christians, and lie, and be lyers, and lie in so saying. Now this is the highest kind of ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and certainly must therefore work the saddest sort of effects. Thus mans best things are lies. His ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry saying, I know him, I have fellowship with him, I am a <hi>Jew,</hi> a Christian, is a lie. His <hi>life</hi> giveth his <hi>mouth</hi> the lie:<note place="margin">Acts 5.4. Rev. 21.8.27. chap. 22.15.</note> and all knowing men are sure he lies. 1. He lies un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God: he speaks lies <hi>in</hi> the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, and <hi>to</hi> the very face of God. Now this is a daring thing: I know their lies, saith he: and shall he no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> recompence for this? See these Scriptures in the Margent, and take
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:48078:66"/>
heed. I speak to you that religious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly name the name of Christ, and yet do not depart from iniquity. 2. <hi>He lies unto men</hi>; every know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing man; every man that is able to judge of the tree by the fruit, knows that that man is a lier, and that his whole profession as to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self is a lie, if he doth not depart from iniquity. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> called the slow bellies, the unsound professors among the <hi>Cretians,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tit. 1.12, 13, 14, 15, 16.</note> liers. They were so in his eyes, for that their professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the name of Christ was not seconded with such a life as became a people professing godliness. They did not depart from iniquity. But again, 3. Such a man is a lier to his own soul. What ever such an one promiseth to himself, his soul will find it a lie. There be many in the world that profess the name of Christ, and consequently promise their soul the injoyment of that good, that indeed is wrapt up in him, but they will certainly be mistaken here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about, and with the greatest terror, will find it so, when they shall hear that direful sentence,<note place="margin">Luk. 13.27.</note> 
               <hi>Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity.</hi> Christ
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:48078:66"/>
is resolved that the loose-lived pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor shall not stand in the judgment, nor any such sinners in the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the righteous. They have lied to God, to men, and to themselves; but J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sus then will not lie unto them: He will plainly tell them that he hath not known them, and that they shall not abide in his presence. But,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Those that religiously name the name of Christ should depart from iniquity, else, as they are liers in their profession, so they are self-deceivers. I told you but now such lie to themselves, and so consequently they deceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. <hi>But be ye doers of the word,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jam. 1.22.</note> 
               <hi>not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.</hi> 'Tis a sad thing for a man, in, and about eternal things, to prove a deceiver of others; but for a man to deceive himself, his own self of eternal life, this is saddest of all: Yet there is in man a propenseness so to do. Hence the Apostle says, <hi>be not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,</hi> and let no man deceive him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. And again,<note place="margin">Vers. 26.</note> 
               <hi>If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:48078:67"/>
not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this mans Religion is vain.</hi> These words [But deceiveth his own heart] I have much mused about: for they seem to me to be spoken to shew how bold and prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously desperate some men are, who yet religiously name the name of Christ: desperate I say at self deceiving. <hi>He deceiveth his own heart</hi>; he otherwayes perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth it, than of its own self it would go: Ordinarily men are said to be deceived by their hearts, but here's a man that is said to deceive his own heart, flattering it off from the scent and dread of those convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that by the word sometimes it hath been under: perswading of it that there needs no such strictness of life be added to a profession of Faith in Christ, as by the Gospel is called for: or that since Christ has died for us, and rose again, and since salvation is alone in him, we need not be so concerned, or be so strict to matter how we live. This man is a self deceiver: <hi>he deceives his own heart.</hi> Self deceiving, and that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout spiritual, and eternal things,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:48078:67"/>
specially when men do it willingly, is one of the most unnatural, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable, and unaccountable acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the world. 1. It is one of the most <hi>unnatural</hi> actions. For here a man seeks his <hi>own</hi> ruin,<note place="margin">Prov. 1.18.</note> 
               <hi>and privily lurks for his own life.</hi> We all cry out against him that murthers his Children, his Wife, or his own body, and condemn him to be one of those that has forgot the rules, and love of nature: But behold the man under consideration is ingaged in such designs as will terminate in his own destruction: he deceiveth his own soul. 2. This is also the most unreasonable act; there can no cause, nor crum of cause that has the least spark or dram of reason, or of any thing that looks like rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, be shewen why a man should deceive himself, and bereave his soul of eternal life. Therefore, 3. Such men are usually passed over with astonishment and silence. <hi>Be astonished O Heavens at this!</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jer. 2.11, 12, 13.</note> 
               <hi>and be ye horribly afraid, for my people have committed two evils, they have forsak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en me the fountain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of living waters, and hewed them out Cisterns, broken
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:48078:68"/>
Cisterns, that can hold no water.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But above all; This, as to this head, is the most amazing place, where 'tis said that the self decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver makes his self deceiving, his sport:<note place="margin">2 Pet. 2.13.</note> 
               <hi>Sporting themselves with their own deceivings.</hi> These are a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple far gone to be sure, that are arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to such an height of negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, carelesness, wantonness, and desparateness of spirit, as to take pleasure <hi>in,</hi> and make a sport <hi>of</hi> that which will assuredly deceive them forever. But this is the fruit of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing of Christ, and of not depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from iniquity. The wisdom and judgment of God is such, as to give such over to the sporting of themselves in their own deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Those that religiously name the name of Christ, should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from iniquity, because of the scandal that will else assuredly come upon Religion, and the things of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion through them. Upon this head I may begin to write, with a <hi>sigh</hi>; For never more of this kind than now. There is no place where the professors of religion are, that is clean
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:48078:68"/>
and free from offence and scandal. Iniquity is so intailed to religion, and baseness of life to the naming of the name of Christ, that one may say of the professors of this age, as 'twas said of them of old,<note place="margin">Isa. 28.8.</note> 
               <hi>All places are full of vomit and filthiness, so that there is no place clean.</hi> Where are they even amongst those that strive for the rule, that mind it at all, when it pinches upon their lusts, their pride, avarice and wantonness? Are not, now adays, the bulk of professors like those that strive at a Gnat and swallow a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel? Yea,<note place="margin">Mat. 23.24. Jer. 2.33.</note> do not professors teach the wicked ones to be wicked? Ah! Lord God, this is a lamentation, and will be for a lamentation. What asore disease is now got into the Church of God, that the Generality of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors should walk with scandal!</p>
            <p>No fashion, no vanity, no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuseness, and yet no niggardliness but is found among professors. They pinch the poor and nip from them their due, to maintain their own pride and vanity. I shall not need to instance particulars, for from the Rich to the Poor, from the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:48078:69"/>
Pastor to the People, from the Master to his Man, and from the Mistress to her Maiden, all are guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of scandal, and of reproaching, by their lives, the name of the Lord. For they profess, and name that worthy name of Christ, but are not, as they should, departed from iniquity.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Hence the name of God is polluted and reproached even till God is weary and cries out, <hi>pollute ye my name no more with your gifts,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ezek. 20.39.</note> 
               <hi>and with your Idols.</hi> O do not pollute my name, says God: Rather leave off profession, and go every one to his wickedness. Tell the world, if you will not depart from iniquity, that Christ and you are parted, and that you have left him, to be imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by them to whom iniquity is an abomination. 'Twould far better secure the name of God from scandal and reproach, than for you to name the name of Christ, and yet not to depart from iniquity. Then, though you sin as now you do, the poor world would not cry out, <hi>Ay! this is your Religion</hi>! Then they would not have occasion to vilifie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:48078:69"/>
because of you; since you tell them that Christ and you are parted. But,</p>
            <p n="2">2. If you will not leave off to name the name of Christ, nor yet depart from iniquity, you also scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal the sincere professors of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; and that is a grievous thing. There are a people in the world that have made it their business e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver since they knew Christ, to cleanse themselves from all filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of flesh and spirit, and that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to perfect holiness in the fear of God: and you scandalous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors mixing your selves with them,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 2.13. Jud. 12.</note> 
               <hi>make their gold look dim.</hi> You are spots and blemishes to them; you are an evil mixing it self with their good, and a scandal to their holy profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. They are you that make the heart of the righteous sad, whom God would not have sad. They are you that offend his little ones. O! the Mill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone that God will shortly hang a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout your necks, when the time is come that you must be d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="3">
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:48078:70"/>3. If you will not leave off to name the name of Christ, nor yet depart from iniquity; you continue to extend your scandal also <hi>to the word and doctrine of God.</hi> They that name the name of Jesus religiously, should so carry it in the world, that they might adorn the doctrin of God their Saviour: but thou that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessest, and yet departest not from iniquity; thou causest the name and doctrine which thou professest, to be blasphemed,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 6.1. Tit. 2.5, 10.</note> and reproached by the men of this world; and that is a sad thing, a thing that will bring so heavy a load upon thee, when God shall open thine eyes (and he will open them either here or in hell-fire, that thou wilt repent it with great bitterness of soul. The Lord smite thee to the making of thee sensible to thy shame, and conversion, if it be his blessed will. <hi>Amen.</hi> But,</p>
            <p n="4">4. If thou wilt not leave off to name the name of Christ, nor yet depart from iniquity, thou wilt bring reproach, scorn and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt upon thy self. <hi>For sin is a reproach to any people.</hi>

               <hi>have I also made you contemptible and base before all the people, according as you have not kept my ways, but have lifted up the face against my Law.</hi> 3. Such shall also be contemned, and had in derision of the men of this world. They shall be an hissing, a by-word, a taunt and a reproach among all people. <hi>For him that honoureth me,</hi> saith God, <hi>I will honour,</hi>

               <hi>but he that despiseth me, shall be lightly esteemed.</hi> I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that <hi>Philpot</hi> used to tell the Papists that they danced BARE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ARSED in a Net, because of the evil of their ways; and the Lord bids professors have a care <hi>that the shame of their nakedness does not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,</hi> or lest they walk naked, and their shame be discovered. For those professors that depart not from iniquity, however they think of themselves, their nakedness is seen of others. And if it be a shame to the modest to have their naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness seen of others, what bold and brazen brows have they who are not
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:48078:71"/>
ashamed to shew their nakedness, yea, <hi>the very</hi> shame of it, to all that dwell about them? And yet thus doth every one that religiously names the name of Christ, and yet doth not depart from iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Those that religiously name the name of Christ, and do not depart from iniquity; <hi>They are the cause of the perishing of many.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 18.7.</note> Wo, saith Christ, <hi>to the world because of offences</hi>: And again, <hi>wo to that man by whom the offence cometh.</hi> These are they that cause many to stumble at sin, and fall into Hell.

               <hi>You have caused many to stumble at the Law,</hi> and at religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Men that are for taking of occasion, you give it them: men that would enter into the Kingdom; you puzle, and confound them with your iniquity, while you name the name of Christ, and do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part therefrom. <hi>One sinner destroyeth much good</hi>: these are the men that incourage the vile to be yet more vile; these be the men that quench weak desires in others; and these
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:48078:71"/>
be the men that tempt the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant to harden themselves against their own salvation. A professor that hath not forsaken his iniquity, is like one that comes out of the Pest-house among the whole, with his Plague sores running upon him. This is the man that hath the breath of a Dragon, he poysons the Air round about him. This is the man that slays his children, his kinsmen, his friend, and himself. What shall I say? A man that nam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the name of Christ, and that departeth not from iniquity; to whom may he be compared? The <hi>Pharisees,</hi> for that they professed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, but walked not answerable thereto, unto what doth Christ compare them, but to Serpents and Vipers; what does he call them, but hypocrites, Whited Walls,<note place="margin">Mat. 23.</note> Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted sepulchers, fools, and blind? and tells them that they made men more the children of H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

of many.<note place="margin">Prov. 11.30.</note> 
               <hi>The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life</hi>: but what is the fruit of the wicked? of the professors that are wicked? why, not to perish <hi>alone</hi> in their iniquity.<note place="margin">Job 22.20.</note> These, as the Dragon, draw many of the Stars of Heaven,<note place="margin">Rev. 12.4.</note> and cast them to the earth with their most stinking tail: cast many a professor into earthly and carnal delights, with their most filthy conversations.</p>

               <hi>But perhaps some may ask me,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Quest.</note> 
               <hi>what iniquity they must depart from, that religiously name the name of Christ</hi>?</p>
            <p>I answer, first, in general,<note place="margin">Answ. 1.</note> Those that religiously profess the name of Christ, must depart from all iniquity.<note place="margin">Heb. 12.2. 1 Thes. 5.22.</note> They should lay aside <hi>every</hi> weight; they should fly <hi>all</hi> appearance of
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:48078:73"/>
evil. Many there be that are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to part with some sins, some pleasures some unjust Prophets, if they may be saved: but this selling of <hi>all,</hi> parting with <hi>all,</hi> forsaking of all, is a very hard chapter.</p>
            <p>And yet the Lord Jesus lays it there,<note place="margin">Luk 14.33.</note> saying so <hi>likewise, whosoever he be of you</hi> (of any of you that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth my name) <hi>that forsaketh not all that he hath, he cannot be my dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple.</hi> Christ by this Text requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth more of them that are his than to forsake all iniquity: Wherefore to be sure, every sin is included. No less than <hi>Vniversal</hi> obedience,<note place="margin">Hos. 10.2.</note> will prove a man sincere. A divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded heart <hi>is a faulty one.</hi> He that forsaketh not every sin,<note place="margin">Job 20.13. Joh. 14.21, 22, 23, 24.</note> 
               <hi>is partial in the Law,</hi> nor can he have respect to all Gods Commandments. There can be no true love to Christ where there are <hi>reserves</hi>; he that will hide any one sin in his bosom, or that will keep it, as the phrase is, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his tongue, is a secret enemy to Jesus Christ. He loveth not Christ that keepeth not his sayings. To halt between two is nought, and
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:48078:73"/>
no man can serve two Masters. Christ is a Master, and sin is a Master: yea, and Masters are they, so op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite, that he that at all shall cleave to the one, shall by the other be counted his enemy. If sin at all be countenanced, Christ counts himself despised. What man would count himself beloved of his Wife, that knows she hath a bosom for another? <hi>Thou shalt not be for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other man,</hi> saith he,<note place="margin">Hos. 3.3.</note> 
               <hi>so will I be for thee.</hi> Would the King count him a Loyal subject, who would hide in his house, nourish in his Bed, and feed at his Table, one that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placably hateth and seeketh to murder his Majesty? Why, sin is <hi>such</hi> an enemy to the Lord Jesus Christ: therefore as Kings command that Traitors be delivered up to Justice; so Christ commands, <hi>that we depart from iniquity. Take away all iniquity,</hi> is a good prayer, and to <hi>resist unto blood, striving against sin,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hos. 14.2. Heb. 12.4. 2 Cor. 10.5.</note> is a good warfare, and he that brings every thought to the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Christ gets a brave victory. Grace leaveneth the whole soul,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:48078:74"/>
and so consequently all the parts thereof: now where the whole is leavened, the tast must needs be the same throughout. Grace leaves no power, faculty, or passion of the soul unsanctified; wherefore there is no corner in a sanctified soul, where sin may hide his head, to find rest, and abode without controul: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently, he that has harbour for this or that sin, and that can find an hiding place, and an abode for it in his heart, is no Christian man. Let them then that christianly name the name of Christ, make it mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest that they do not do it feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly, by departing from iniquity. But,</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Answ. 2.</note>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> And more particularly: They that name the name of Christ, as above, let them depart from their <hi>Constitution-sin,</hi> or if you will, the sin that their temper most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines them to. Every man is not alike inclined to the same sin, but some to one and some to another: Now let the man that professes the name of Christ religiously, consider with himself, unto what sin or va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity am I most inclined; is it Pride?
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:48078:74"/>
is it Covetousness? is it fleshly lust? And let him labour, by all means, to leave off and depart from that. This is that which <hi>David</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>his own iniquity,</hi> and saith, I was also upright before him, <hi>and I kept my self from mine iniquity.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 18.23</note> Rightly are these two put together; for it is not possible that he should be an upright man that indulgeth, or coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanceth his constitution-sin; but on the contrary, he that keeps himself from that will be upright as to all the rest: and the reason is, because if a man has that grace as to trample up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and mortifie his darling, his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som, his only sin, he will more easily and more heartily abhor and fly the rest.</p>
            <p>And indeed, if a man will depart from iniquity, he must depart from his darling sin first: for as long as that is entertained, the other, at least those that are most suiting with that darling, will always be haunting of him. There is a man that has such and such haunt his house, and spend his substance, and would be rid of them, but cannot: but now, let him rid himself of that,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:48078:75"/>
for the sake of which they haunt his house, and then he shall with ease be rid of them. Thus it is with sin. There is a man that is plagued with many sins, perhaps because he imbraceth one; well, let him turn that one out of doors and that's the way to be rid of the rest. Keep thee from thy darling, thy bosom, thy constitution-sin.</p>
            <p>Motives to prevail with thee to fall in with this exhortation, are se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral.</p>
            <p n="1">1. There can no great change appear in thee, make what profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Christ thou wilt, unless thou cast away thy bosom sin. A mans constitution-sin, is, as I may call it, <hi>his visible sin</hi>; 'tis that by which his neighbours know him and describe him: whether it be pride, Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousness, lightness, or the like; now if these abide with thee, though thou shouldest be much reformed in thy notions, and in other parts of thy life. Yet say thy neighbours, he is the same man still: his Faith has not saved him from his darling: he was proud afore, and is proud still; was covetous afore, and
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:48078:75"/>
is covetous still; was light and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton afore, and is so still. He is the same man, though he has got a new mouth. But now, if thy <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution</hi>-sin be parted with, if thy darling be cast away, thy <hi>conversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> is apparent, 'tis seen of all, for the casting away of that is death to the rest, and ordinarily makes a change throughout.</p>
            <p n="2">2. So long as thy constitution-sin remains, as winked at by thee, so long thou art an hypocrite before God; let thy profession be what it will: also when Conscience shall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake and be commanded to speak to thee plainly, what thou art, it will tell thee so, to thy no little vexation and perplexity.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Besides, do what thou canst, so long as thou remainest <hi>thus,</hi> thou wilt be of a scandalous life. No honour is brought to religion by such. But,</p>
            <p>Again, As they that name the name of Christ should depart from their <hi>constitution</hi>-sin: so they should depart from the sins of other mens <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>empers also. Much harm among <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:48078:76"/>
There is a man that has clean es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped from those who live in er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror: has shaken off the carnal world and the men thereof, and is come among professors, but behold, <hi>there</hi> also he meeteth with wicked men, with men that have not departed from iniquity, and there he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled. This is a sad thing, and yet so it is. I doubt there are some in the world, I mean professors, that will curse the day that ever they were acquainted with some pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors. There are professors that are defilers, professors that are wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men,<note place="margin">Jer. 5.26. Jer. 2.33.</note> professors of whom a <hi>wicked man</hi> may learn to sin. Take heed of these, lest having fled from thine own sins, thou shouldest be taken with the sins of others. <hi>Be not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of other mens sins,</hi> is the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel and caution that <hi>Paul</hi> giveth to <hi>Timothy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 5.22.</note> if he would <hi>keep himself pure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Dost thou profess the name of Christ, and dost thou pretend to be a man departing from iniquity? Then take heed thou dost not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceive thy self, by changing one bad way of sinning, for another bad
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:48078:76"/>
way of sinning. This was a trick that <hi>Israel</hi> plaid of Old: for when Gods Prophets followed them hard with demands of Repentance and Reformation, then they would <hi>gad about to change their ways</hi>;<note place="margin">Jer. 2.36.</note> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, they would not change a bad way for a good, but one bad way for another; hopping as the <hi>Squir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel,</hi> from bow to bow, but not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to forsake the tree. Hence they were said to return, but not to the Most High.<note place="margin">Hos. 7.16.</note> Take heed I say of this: Many leave off to be drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards, and fall in with covetousness: many fall off from covetousness to pride and lasciviousness: take heed of this. This is a grand deceit, and a common one too, a deceit of a long standing, and almost a disease <hi>Epidemical</hi> among professors.</p>
            <p>Many times men change their dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling sins, as some change their Wives and Servants; that which would serve for such an one this year, may not serve to be so for the year insu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Hypocrisie would do a while ago, but now Debauchery. Profaneness would do, when Profaneness was in fashion; but now a deceitful Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession.
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:48078:77"/>
Take heed, professor, that thou dost not throw away thy old darling sin for a new one. Mens tempers alter. Youth is for Pride and wantonness, Middle age for cunning and craft, Old age for the world and Covetousness. Take heed therefore of deceit in this thing.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Dost thou profess the name of Christ, and dost thou pretend to be a man departing from iniquity? take heed lest thy departing from iniquity should be but for a time: Some do depart from iniquity, as persons in wrangling fits depart from one another; to wit, for a time, but when the quarrel is over, by means of some intercessor, they are reconciled again. O! Satan is the intercessor between the soul and sin, and though the breach between these two may seem to be irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileable; yea, though the soul has sworn it will never give countenance to so vile a thing as sin is, more <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet he can tell how to make up this difference,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 2.18, 19, 20, 21, 22.</note> and to fetch them back to their vo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

escaped his sins, and been gone. Take heed therefore, O professor: For there is danger of this, and the height of danger lies in it. And I think that Satan, to do this thing, makes use of those sins again, to begin this rejoynder, which he findeth most suitable to the temper and constitution of the sinner. These are, as I may call them, the Master sins; they suit, they jump with the temper of the soul: these as the little end of the Wedge, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with ease, and so make way for those that come after, with which Satan knows he can rend the soul in pieces. Wherefore,</p>
            <p n="6">6. To help this, take heed of parlying with thy sins again, when once thou hast departed from them: Sin has a smooth tongue; if thou harken to its inchanting language, ten thousand to one but thou art intan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled. See the saying of the Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,<note place="margin">Prov. 7.21, 22.</note>

               <hi>depart from the iniquity of the times.</hi> There are sins that may be called <hi>the iniquity of the day.</hi> It was thus in <hi>Noahs</hi> day, it was thus in <hi>Lots</hi> day, and 'twas thus in Christs day; I mean in the days of his flesh: and 'tis a famous thing for professors to keep themselves from the iniquities of the times.

And hence it is that the Lord doth manifest such wrath against his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that are guilty of the common sin of their day, and that he shews such special favour to them that abstain therefrom. Was there no more, think you, but <hi>Noah,</hi> in his gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration that feared <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Vnbelief</hi> was the sin of the day, when <hi>Israel</hi> was going from <hi>Aegypt</hi> to <hi>Canaan</hi>; therefore all that were guilty of that transgression, must be deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to go in to see that good Land, yea, though it were <hi>Moses</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. <hi>And the Lord said to</hi> Moses <hi>and</hi> Aaron,<note place="margin">Numb. 20.12.</note>

They shall enter into my Sanctuary, and they shall come near to my table to minister unto me, and they shall keep my charge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Great complaints have we now among professors, of deadness in duties, barrenenss of the ministry, and of the withdrawing of God from his people; But I can tell you a cause of all this, namely, the sin of the day is got into the Church of God, and has defiled that holy place. This is the ground and cause of all these things: nor is it like to be otherwise, till the cause shall be removed. If any should ask me what are the sins of our day. I would say they are conspicuous,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:48078:80"/>
they are open,<note place="margin">Isa. 3.9.</note> they are declared as <hi>Sodoms</hi> were.

            <p>And I say again, when you find out a professor that is not horribly tainted with some of these things, (I exclude not the Ministers nor their families) let him be as a <hi>Beacon</hi> upon an Hill, or as an <hi>Insign</hi> in our Land.

               </gap> make our selves ridiculous? and says a third, such and such more Godly Wise than we, do so. But I answer, if God has made you singular, and called you to grace, that's singular; and bid you wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

and diverse from the ways of all others. Yea, if to depart from iniquity will make you ridiculous, if to be holy in all manner of conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation will make you ridiculous, then be contented to be counted so. As for the Godly-wise you speak of, let them manifest themselves to be such by departing from iniquity. I am sure that their being tainted with sins of the day, will not prove them godly-wise. <hi>Behold, I have taught you,</hi> said Moses, <hi>Statutes and Judgments, even as the Lord my God commanded me; that ye should do so in the Land whither ye go to possess it.

               <hi>that he will command his children and his houshold after him, and they shall keep the way of the Lord.</hi> To make religion, and the power of godliness the chief of my designs at home, among those, among whom God by a special hand has placed me, is that which is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to God, and that obtaineth a good report of him. But to pass these, and to come to other things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A Master of a family, and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress of the same, are those that are intrusted of God, with those under their tuition and care to be brought up for him; be they children or ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. This is plain from the Text last mentioned: wherefore here is a charge committed to thee of God: look to it, and consider with thy self, whether thou hast done such duty and service for God in this matter, as, setting common frailties aside, thou canst with good Conscience lift up thy face unto God: The which to be sure, thou canst by no means do, if iniquity, to the utmost, be not banished out of thy house.</p>

I took him to do my work, not to train him up in religion.</hi> Well, suppose the soul of thy servant be thus little worth in thine eyes: Yet what wilt thou say for thy children, who behold all thy ways, and are as capable of drinking up the poyson of thy footsteps, as the Swine is of drinking up swill: I say, what wilt thou do for them? Children will learn to be nought of Parents, of professing Parents soonest of all: They will be temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to think all that they do is right. I say, what wilt thou say to this?

sin by the carriages of professing Parents. If it was counted, of old,<note place="margin">Hos. 9.13.</note> a sad thing for a man to bring forth children to the Sword, as <hi>Ephraim</hi> did: What will it be for a man to bring up children for Hell, and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation? But,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly</hi> Let those that name the name of Christ,<note place="margin">Answ. 5.</note> depart from the <hi>iniquity</hi> of their Closet. This may be called part of the iniquity of the house: But because it is not publick, but as a retired part, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I put it here by it self. There are are many Closet sins that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors may be guilty of, and from which they have need to depart: as,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> There is the pride of a <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary,</hi> that is, the study or Closet, and I doubt this sin and iniquity to this day is with many great professors: and in my judgment it is thus manifested.</p>
            <p n="1">1. When men secretly please themselves to think 'tis known what a stock of Books they have; or when they take more pleasure in the number of, than the matter contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their books.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="136" facs="tcp:48078:88"/>2. When they buy books rather to make up a number, than to learn to be good and godly men there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by.</p>
            <p n="3">3. When, though they own their books to be good and godly, yet they will not conform there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</p>
            <p>This is an iniquity now on foot in this Land, and ought to be departed from. 'Tis better to have no books, and depart from iniquity, than to have a thousand, and not to be bettered in my soul thereby.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> There is an iniquity that attends the Closet, which I may call by the name of <hi>vacancy.</hi> When men have a Closet to talk of, not to pray in; a Closet to look upon, not to bow before God in; a Closet to lay up Gold in, but not to mourn in for the sins of my life. A Closet, that could it speak, would say, my owner is seldom here upon his knees before the God of Heaven: seldom here humbling himself, for the iniquity of his heart, or
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:48078:88"/>
or to thank God for the mercies of his life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Then also a man is guilty of Closet-iniquity, when though he doth not utterly live in the neglect of duty, he formally, carnally, and without reverence and godly fear performs it. Also when he asketh God for that which he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not abide should be given him, or when he prayeth for that in his Closet, that he cannot abide in his house, nor his life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Then also a man is guilty of Closet-iniquity, when he desireth that the sound of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion he doth there, may be heard by them without in the house; the street, or of those that dwell by.<note place="margin">Mat. 6.6, 7.</note> For a Closet is only for the man, and God, to do things in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly.</p>
            <p>These things let the professor beware of, lest he add to his ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, sin; untill he, and it comes to be loathsom. The Closet is by God appointed for men to wait upon him in, and to do it without hypocrisie. To wait there
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:48078:89"/>
for his mind, and his will, and also for grace to perform it. And how can a man that went last time out of his Closet to be nought, have the face to come thither again? If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear my prayer; and if so, then he will not meet me in my Closet; and if so, then I shall quickly be weary thereof, being left to my self, and the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of my mind.</p>
            <p>It is a great thing to be a Closet-Christian, and to hold it: he must be a <hi>Close</hi>-Christian, that will be a <hi>Closet</hi>-Christian. When I say, a <hi>Close-Christian,</hi> I mean one that is so in the hidden part, and that also walks with God. Many there be that profess Christ, who doe oftener (in <hi>London</hi>) frequent the <hi>Coffee-house</hi> than their <hi>Closet</hi>; and that sooner in a morning run to make bargains, than to pray unto God, and begin the day with him. But for thee, who professest the name of Christ, do thou depart from all these things; do thou make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science of reading, and practising,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:48078:89"/>
do thou follow after righteousness; do thou make conscience of begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the day with God: for he that begins it not with him, will hardly end it with him. He that runs from God in the morning, will hardly find him at the close of the day: Nor will he that begin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

'Tis he that finds God in his Closet, that will carry the savour of him into his house, his shop, and his more open con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation: when <hi>Moses</hi> had been with God in the Mount,<note place="margin">Exo. 34.</note> his <hi>face shone</hi>; he brought of that glory into the Camp.</p>

<pb n="141" facs="tcp:48078:90"/>
Wicked spirits do not only tempt men to transgress the moral law, but do present themselves in heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things, working there, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring in them, to wrest the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and turn the understanding and conscience awry in those high and most important things. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I say, we must be the more watchful, and careful lest we be abused in our notions and best prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, by the iniquities that joyn themselves thereto.</p>
            <p>'Tis strange to see at this day, how, notwithstanding all the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of God, men are wedded to their own opinions, beyond what the law of grace and love will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit. Here's a <hi>Presbyter,</hi> heres an <hi>Independent,</hi> an <hi>Anabaptist,</hi> so joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed each man to his own opinion, that they cannot have that communion one with another, as by the testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lord Jesus, they are commanded and injoyned. What is the cause? Is the Truth? No! God is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="142" facs="tcp:48078:91"/>
of his own opinion, abounds too much in his own sence, and takes not care to separate his opinion from the iniquity that cleaveth thereto. That this confusion is in the Church of Christ, I am of <hi>Paul,</hi> I of <hi>Apollo,</hi> I of <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas,</hi> &amp; I of <hi>Christ,</hi> is too manifest. But what unbecoming language is this for the Children of the same Father, members of the same body, and heirs of the same glory to be accustomed to? whether it is Pride, or Hypocrisie, or Ignorance, or Self, or the Devil, or the Jesuite, or all these joyntly working with the Church, that makes and maintains these names of distinction. This distance, and want of love, this contempt of one another, these base and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuing thoughts of brethren, will be better seen, to the shame and confusion of some, in the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, I advise thee with whom I am at this time concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to take heed of this mixture, this sinful mixture of trut<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> and ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity together. And to help thee in this thing: keep thine eye much
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:48078:91"/>
upon thine own base self, labour also to be sensible of the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ctions that cleave to thy best performances, be clothed with humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and prefer thy brother before thy self: and know that Christianity lieth not in small matters, neither be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, nor understanding men. And it would be well if those that so stickle by their private and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptural notions (which only is iniquity cleaving to truth): I say it would be well if such were more sound in faith, and morals, and i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> by their lives they gave better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction to the world, that the truth and grace of Christ is in them.</p>
            <p>Sometimes, so much iniquity is mixed with good opinions that it prevails, not only to hurt men in this world, but to drown them in misery everlasting. 'Twas good that the <hi>J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ws</hi> did own and allow the ceremonies of the law, but since the iniquity that joyned it self thereto, did prevail with them to make those ceremonies copartners with Christ in those matters that
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:48078:92"/>
pertained to Christ alone: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they perished in them. The <hi>Galatians</hi> also with many of the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians</hi> had like to have been over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown by these things. Take heed therefore of that iniquity that seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to steal, with the truth, into thy heart, thy judgment and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding.</p>
            <p>Nor doth one iniquity come with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out another, they are linked toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and come by companies, and therefore usually they that are superstitious in one thing, are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted in several other. The more a man stands upon his points to justifie himself, and to condemn his holy brethren: the more danger he is in of being overcome of divers evils. And it is the wisdom of God to let it be so, that flesh might not glory in his presence. <hi>His soul, that is lifted up</hi>;<note place="margin">Hab. 2.4.</note> to wit, with his good doings, with his order, and methods in religion, <hi>his soul is not upright in him.</hi> I have often said in my heart, what is the reason that some of the brethren should be so shy of holding communion, with

those every whit as good, if not better, than themselves? Is it b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of their holy fellowship? No verily: it is because they exalt themselves, they are leavened with some iniquity that hath mixed it self with some good opinions that they hold, and therefore it is that they say to others, <hi>stand by thy self, come not near me,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isa. 65.5.</note> 
               <hi>for I am holier than thou</hi>: But what is the sentence of God concerning those? Why, these are a smoke in my nose, a fire that burneth all the day. Wherefore, as I said before, so I say now again, take heed of the iniquity that clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth to good opinions. The which thou wilt in no wise be able to shun, unless thou beest clothed with humility. But,</p>

This exhortation is as the first, general; for hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies are of that nature, that they spread themselves (as the leprosie of the body) all over; not the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of the soul only, but all the

Hypocrisie will be in the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> in Conference, in Closets, in Communion of Saints, in Faith, in Love, in Repentance, in Zeal, in Humility, in Alms, in the Prison, and in all duties. So that here is, for the keeping of thy soul upright and sincere, more than ordinary diligence to be used. Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie is one of the most abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable of iniquities. It is a sin that dares it with God. It is a sin that saith, God is ignorant, or that he delighteth in iniquity. It is a sin that flattereth, that dissembleth, that offereth to hold God, as it were, fair in hand about that which is neither purposed nor intended. It is also a sin that puts a man upon studying and contriving to beguile,<note place="margin">Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie a vile sin.</note> and deceive his Neighbour, as to the bent and intent of the heart, and also as to the cause and end of acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:48078:93"/>
It is a sin that perswadeth a man to make a shew of Civility, Morality, or Christian religion as a cloak, a pretence, a guise to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive withal. It will make a man preach for a place, and praise, rather than to glorifie God and save souls; It will put a man upon talking that he may be commended; It will make a man, when he is at prayer in his Closet, strive to be heard without doors; It will make a man ask for that he desireth not, and shew zeal in duties, when his heart is as cold, as senseless, and as much without savour, as a clod: It will make a man pray to be seen and heard of men, rather than to be heard of God. It will make a man strive to weep, when he repenteth not, and to pretend much friendship, when he doth not love. It will make a man pretend to experience, and sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, when he has none; and to faith and sincerity, when he knows not what they are. There is opposed to this sin, <hi>simplicity, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency,</hi> and godly <hi>sincerity,</hi> without which three graces, thou wilt be an

            <p>Of all sins, the sin of Hypocrisie bespeaks a man most in love with some lust, because he dissembleth both with God and man to keep it.</p>
            <p>For a conclusion upon this seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold answer to the question above propounded; let me advise those that are tender of the name of Christ, to have regard to these things.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="150" facs="tcp:48078:95"/>
               <hi>First,</hi> Be well acquainted with the word, and with the general rules of holiness; to wit, with the moral law, the want of this is a cause of much unholiness of conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation. These licentious and evil times, wherein we live, are full of iniquity, nor can we (though we never so much love God) do our duty as we are injoyned, if we do not know it. The law is cast behind the back of many, when it should be carried in the <hi>hand,</hi> and <hi>heart,</hi> that we might do it to the end, the Gospel, which we profess, might be glorified in the world. Let then the law be with thee to love it, and do it in the spirit of the Gospel, that thou be not unfruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in thy life. Let the law, I say, be with thee, not as it comes from <hi>Moses,</hi> but from Christ; for though thou art set free from the law, as a Covenant for life, yet thou still art under the law to Christ, and it is to be received by thee, as out of his hand, to be a rule for thy conversation in the world.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 9.18.</note> What then thou art about to do, do it or
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:48078:95"/>
leave it undone as thou shalt find it approved, or forbidden by the law. And when ought shall come into thy mind to be done, and thou art at a stand, and at a loss about the lawfulness, or unlawfulness thereof, then betake thy self to the law of thy God, which is in thy hand, and ask if this thing be good, or to be avoided.</p>
            <p>If this were practised by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors, there would not be so much iniquity found in their Beds, their Houses, their Shops, and their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versations as there is.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> As thou must be careful to find out the lawfulness or unlawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of a thing before thou puttest forth thy hand thereto: so thou must also consider again, whether that which is lawful is <hi>expedient.</hi> A thing may be lawful in it self, and may yet be unlawful to thee, to wit; if there be an inconveniency, or an inexpediency attending the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6.12. chap. 10.23.</note> 
               <hi>All things are lawful for me,</hi> says the Apostle, <hi>but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but all things edifie not.</hi> This
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:48078:96"/>
then thou must consider, and this also thou must practise.</p>
            <p>But this is a hard lesson, and impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to be done except thou art addicted to self-denial. For this Text, and so the practice of what is contained therein, has respect chiefly <hi>to another,</hi> to wit, to thy neighbour, and his advantage and edification; and it supposeth, yea, injoyneth thee, if thou wilt depart from iniquity, to forbear also some things that are lawful, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently profitable to thee, for the sake of, and of love to thy neighbour. But how little of this is found among men? Where is the man that will forbear some law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful things, for fear of hurting the weak thereby. Alas! how many are there that this day profess, that will not forbear palpable wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: No, though the salvation of their own souls are endangered thereby; and how then should these forbear things that are lawful, even of godly tenderness to the weakness of their neighbour?</p>

               <hi>The heart is deceitful</hi>: and, <hi>he that trusts his heart is a fool</hi>; were not written without a cause. Let as many therefore as would examine themselves about this matter have a jealous eye over their own heart, and take heed of being beguiled thereby: let them mix hearty prayer with this matter, unto God, that he will help them to be faithful to themselves, in this so great a matter, yea, let them compare their lives with the holy Commandment, and judge by that rather than by the fleshly fondness, that men naturally are apt to have for, and of their own acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.

Wherefore take heed of him, for he will be ready at thy side when thou goest about this work. Now for thy help in this matter, set God, the Holy God, the All-seeing God, the sin-revenging God, before thine eyes; <hi>for our God is a consuming fire.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="158" facs="tcp:48078:99"/>Let me then, to press this use far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon thee, shew thee in a few particulars, the danger of not doing of it, that is of not departing from iniquity, since thou professest.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> The iniquity that cleaveth to men that profess, if they cast it not away, but countenance it, will all prove Nettles and Bryers to them: And I will assure thee, yea, thou knowest, that Nettles and Thorns will sting and scratch but ill-favouredly. <hi>I went,</hi> saith Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,<note place="margin">Pro. 24.30, 31.</note> 
               <hi>by the field of the slothful, and by the vineyard of the man void of understanding. And lo, it was all grown over with Thorns, and Nettles had covered the face thereof, and the stone wall thereof was broken down.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Suppose a man were, after work all day, to be turned into a bed of Nettles at night: or after a man had been about such a business, should be rewarded with chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Bryers and Thorns: this would for work be but little help, relief, or comfort to him; why this is the reward of a wicked man, of a wicked professor, from God;
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:48078:99"/>
               <hi>Nettles</hi> and <hi>Thorns</hi> are to cover over the face of his Vineyard, his Field, his Profession, and that at the last of all; for this covering over the face of his Vineyard, with <hi>Nettles</hi> and <hi>Thorns,</hi> is to shew what fruit the slovenly, slothful, careless, profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor will reap out of his profession, when reaping time shall come.</p>
            <p>Nor can he whose Vineyard, whose profession is covered over with these <hi>Nettles</hi> and <hi>Thorns</hi> of iniquity, escape being afflicted with them in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science: For look as they cover the face of his Vineyard through his sloth now, so will they cover the face of his conscience, in the day of judgment. For profession and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science cannot be separated long: If a man then shall make profession without conscience of Gods honour in his conversation, his profession and conscience will meet in the day of his visitation. Nor will he, whose condition this shall be, be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ward off the guilt, and sting of a slothful and bad conversation, from covering the face of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, by retaining in his profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:48078:100"/>
the name of Jesus Christ: For naming, and professing of the name of Christ, will, instead of salving such a conscience, put venom, sting, and keenness into those <hi>Nettles,</hi> and <hi>Thorns,</hi> that then shall be spread o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the face of such consciences. This will be worse than was that cold wet cloth that <hi>Hazael</hi> took and spread over the face of <hi>Benhadad,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 King. 8.15.</note> that he died. This will sting worse, tear worse, torment worse, kill worse. Therefore look to it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Nor may men shift this danger by their own neglect of inquiring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the truth of their separation from iniquity, for, that God himself will search them. <hi>I search the reins and the heart,</hi> saith he, <hi>to give unto every one of you according to his ways.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Revel. 2.23.</note>
            </p>
            <p>There are many that wear the name of Christ for a Cloak, and so make their advantages by their iniquity; but Christ at death and judgment, will rent this Cloak from off such shoulders, then shall they walk na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, yea, the shame of their naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness shall then appear. Now since
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:48078:100"/>
no man can escape the search of God, and so, not his judgment: it will be thy wisdom to search thine own ways, and to prevent judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by judging of thy self.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Christ will deny those to be his that do not depart from iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, though they shall name his name among the rest of his people. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from me,</hi> saith he,<note place="margin">Luk. 13.25, 26, 27.</note> all you that departed not from iniquity. Yea, they that shall n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>me his name religiously, and not depart from iniquity, are denyed by him <hi>all along.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. He alloweth them not <hi>now</hi> to call him Lord.<note place="margin">Luk. 6.46.</note> 
               <hi>And why call ye me Lord, Lord,</hi> saith he, <hi>and do not the things which I say</hi>? He cannot abide to be reputed the Lord of those that presume to profess his name,<note place="margin">Ezek. 2.39.</note> and do not depart from iniquity. The reason is, for that such do but profane his name, and stave others off from falling in love with him and his ways.<note place="margin">Rom. 2.24. Jer. 44.26.</note> Hence he says again, <hi>Behold I have sworn by my great name, saith the Lord, that my name shall no more be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the mouth of any man of Judah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="162" facs="tcp:48078:101"/>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 66.18.</note>2. He regardeth not their prayers. <hi>If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear my prayer.</hi> And if so, then what ever thou hast at the hand of God, thou hast it, not in mercy, but in judgment, and to work out farther thine everlasting misery.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He will not regard their soul, but at the last day will cast it from him, as a thing abhorred by him. As is evidently seen by that thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of <hi>Luke,</hi> but now noted in the margent.</p>
            <p>Wherefore from these few hints, thou, whoever thou art, maiest well perceive what an horrible thing it is to make a profession of the name of Christ, and not to depart from ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity. Therefore let me exhort thee again to examin thy self, if thou hast, and dost, (since thou professest that name) depart from iniquity.</p>
            <p>And here I would distinguish, for there is two parts in iniquity, to wit, the <hi>guilt,</hi> and <hi>filth.</hi> As for the guilt, that is contracted by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, I perswade my self, no man
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:48078:101"/>
who knows it, needs to be bid to desire to depart from that; nay, I do believe that the worst Devil in Hell would depart from his guilt, if he could, and might: but this is it, to wit, to depart from the sweet, the pleasure, and profi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of iniquity. There are that call evil good, iniquity good, and that of professors too: this is that to be departed from, and these are they that are exhorted to forsake it upon the pains and penalties before threatened. Therefore, as I said, let such look to it, that they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin themselves if they depart from iniquity. And come, now thou art going about this work, let me help thee in this matter.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Ask thy heart, what evil dost thou see in sin?</p>
            <p n="2">2. How sick art thou of sin?</p>
            <p n="3">3. What means dost thou use to mortifie thy sins?</p>
            <p n="4">4. How much hast thou been grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to see others break Gods Law, and to find temptations in thy self to do it.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="164" facs="tcp:48078:102"/>
               <hi>For the First,</hi> 1. There is a soul-polluting evil in iniquity,</p>
            <p n="2">2. There is a God provoking evil in iniquity.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There is a soul-damning evil in iniquity. And untill thou comest experimentally to know these things, thou wilt have neither list, nor will, to depart from iniquity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For the Second.</hi> I mean not sick with guilt, for, so the damned in hell are sick, but I mean sick of the filth,<note place="margin">Numb. 11.14, 15. 1 Chro. 4.9, 10. Rom. 7.24. 2 Cor. 5.1, 2, 3. Philip. 3.10, 11, 12, 13, 14.</note> and polluting nature of it. Thus was <hi>Moses</hi> sick of sin, thus <hi>Jabez</hi> was sick of sin, and thus was <hi>Paul</hi> sick of sin.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For the Third.</hi> You know that those that are sensible of a sickness, will look out after the means to be recovered; there is a means also for this disease, and dost thou know what that means is, and hast thou indeed a desire to it? Yea, could<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est thou be willing even now to partake of the means that would help thee to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hat means, that can cure thee of this disease? There are no means can cure a man that is sick of sin, <hi>but glory</hi>; and the means to
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:48078:102"/>
come by that <hi>is Christ,</hi> and to go out of this world by the faith of him. There is no grace can cure this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease; yea, grace doth rather encrease it: For the more grace any man has, the more is he sick of sin; the greater an offence is iniquity to him. So then, there is nothing can cure this disease <hi>but glory</hi>: but immortal glory. And dost thou desire this <hi>Medicine.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 54.</note> And doth God testifie that thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire is true, not feigned. I know that there are many things that do make some even wish to die: but the question is not whether thou dost wish to die: for death can cure many diseases: but is this that that moveth thee to desire to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part; to wit, that thou mightest be rid, quite rid, and stript of a body of death, because nothing on this side the grave can rid thee and strip thee off it. And is <hi>hope,</hi> that this day is approaching, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving cordial to thee? And doth the hope of this strike arrows into the heart of thy lusts, and draw off thy mind, and affections, yet farther, from iniquity.</p>

               <pb n="166" facs="tcp:48078:103"/>
               <hi>To the Fourth.</hi> How much hast thou be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="171" facs="tcp:48078:105"/>If there were any dread of God, or of his word, in the hearts of the men of this generation, the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of this one Text is enough to shake them in pieces: I speak of those that name the name of Christ, but do not depart from iniquity. But the word of God must be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled; In the last days, iniquity must abound; wherefore these days will be perilous and dangerous to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors.<note place="margin">Mat. 24.12. 2 Tim. 3.</note> 
               <hi>In the last days perilous times shall come, for men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blaspheemers, disobedient to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, unthankful, unholy.</hi> I do the oftner harp upon this Text at this time,<note place="margin">Vers. 5.</note> because <hi>it is a prediction</hi> of what shall be in the latter days, to wit, what a Sea and Deluge of iniquity, shall in the latter days o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-spread and drown those that then shall have a form of godliness, and of Religion. So that this day is more dangerous than were the days that have been before us. Now iniquity, even immorality, shall with professors be in fashion, be pleaded for, be loved and more

esteemed,<note place="margin">Vers. 3.</note> than holiness it self. Now godliness, and self-denyal shall be little set by; even those very men that have a form of godliness, hate the life, and power thereof; yea, they shall despise them that are good. Now therefore Ministers must not think that what they say of the Doctrine of self denial among professors, will be much, if at all regarded. I say, regarded, so as to be loved and put in practice by them that name the name of Christ. For the strong hold that iniquity shall have of their affections, will cause that but little, effectualness to this end will be found to attend the preaching of the word unto them.</p>

I told thee before that it is foretold by the word, that in the last dayes, peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous times shall come, and that men shall walk after their own lusts, yea, professors, to their destruction. Nor will it be easie to keep thy self there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from. But even as when the Pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence is come into a place, it infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth, and casteth down the health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful: So the iniquity of the last times will infect and pollute the godly. I mean the generality of them. Were but our times duly compared with those that went before, we should see that which now we are ignorant of.

the word of God, in the <hi>Marian</hi> days, we should see another life than is now among men, another manner of conversation, than now is among professors. But I say, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions and prophecies must be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, and since the word says plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that <hi>in the last days there shall come scoffers,</hi>

            <p>Singularity in godliness, if it be in godliness, no man should be asham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of. For that is no more than to be more godly, than to walk more humbly with God than others: and for my part, I had rather be a pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern, and example of piety: I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that my life should be instructing to the Saints, and condemning to the world, with <hi>Noah,</hi> and <hi>Lot</hi>; than to hazard my self among the multitude of the drossie.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="184" facs="tcp:48078:113"/>I know that many professors will fall short of Eternal life, and my judgment tells me, that they will be of the slovenly sort of professors, that so do.

            <p>For my part I doubt of the faith of many, and fear that it will prove no better at the day of God, than will the faith of Devils. For that it standeth in bare speculation, and is without life and soul to that which is good. Where is the man that walketh with his Cross upon

Because he wanted patience,<note place="margin">Judg. 16.15, 16, 17.</note> he grew angry and was vexed, and could withstand her solicitation no longer. Many there be also that can well enough be contented to shut sin out of doors for a while; but because sin has much fair speech, therefore it overcomes at last.<note place="margin">Pro. 7.21.</note> For sin and iniquity will not be easily said nay:<note place="margin">Jer. 3.</note> It is like her of whom you read, she has a Whores fore-head, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuses to be ashamed. Wherefore departing from iniquity is a work for length, as long as life shall last. A work, did I say? 'tis a War; a continual combate: Wherefore he

that will adventure to set upon this work must needs be armed with <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Patience,</hi> a daily exercise he will find himself put upon,<note place="margin">Mat. 24.13. Revel. 3.10.</note> by the continual attempts of iniquity to be putting forth it self. This is called an enduring to the end, a continuing in the word of Christ, and also a keeping of the word of his patience. But what man in the world can do this, whose heart is not seasoned with the love of God, and the love of Christ? Therefore he that will exercise himself in this work, must be often considering of the love of God to him in Christ: for the more sense, or apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a man shall have of that, the more easie and pleasant will this work be to him. Yea, though the doing thereof should cost him his hearts blood. <hi>Thy loving kindness is before mine eyes</hi> (says <hi>David) and I have walked in thy truth.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 26.1, 2, 3.</note> Nothing like the sense, sight or belief of that, to the man of God, to make him depart from iniquity.</p>

               <note place="margin">Answ.</note>Keep thine eye upon all thy shortnesses, or upon all thy failures, for that is profitable for thee.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The sight of this will make thee base in thine own eyes.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It will give thee occasion to see the need, and excellency of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It will put thee upon prayer to God for help, and pardon.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It will make thee weary of this world.</p>
            <p n="5">5. It will make grace to persevere the more desirable in thine eyes.</p>
            <p>Also it will help thee in the things which follow.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It will make thee see the need of Christs righteousness.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It will make thee see the need of Christs intercession.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It will make thee see thy need of Christs advocateship.</p>

            <p n="5">5. And 'twill make Heaven and eternal life the sweeter to thee when thou comest there.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="189" facs="tcp:48078:115"/>But to the question. Get more grace. For the more grace thou hast, the further is thine heart set off of iniquity, the more also set against it, and the better able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from it, when it cometh to thee, tempteth thee, and intreats thee for entertainment. Now the way to have more grace, is to have more knowledge of Christ, and to pray more fervently in his name: also to subject thy soul and thy lusts with all thy power to the authority of that grace thou hast, and to judge and condemn thy self most heartily before God, for every secret incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation that thou findest in thy flesh to sin-ward.</p>
            <p>The improvement of what thou hast, is that, as I may say, by which God judges how thou wouldest use, if thou hadst it, more; and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that, so shalt thou have, or not have, a farther measure. He that is faithful in that which is least, is faithful (and will be so) also in much, and he that is unjust in the least, is (and will be) unjust also in much. I know Christ speaks here about
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:48078:116"/>
the unrighteous Mammon,<note place="margin">Luk. 16.10, 11, 12.</note> but the same may be applied also unto the thing in hand.</p>
            <p>And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another mans, who will commit unto you that which is your own? That is a remarkable place to this purpose in the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations. Behold,</hi> saith he, <hi>I have set before thee an open door</hi> (that thou maiest have what thou wilt, as was also said to the improving Woman of <hi>Canaan) and no man can shut it</hi>:<note place="margin">Revel. 3.8. Mat. 15.28</note> 
               <hi>for thou hast a little strength, and hast held fast my word, and hast not denyed my name.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A good improvement of what we have of the grace of God at present, pleases God, and ingages him to give us more: but an ill improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of what we at present have, will not do so.<note place="margin">Mat. 25.24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30.</note> 
               <hi>To him that hath,</hi> (that hath an heart to improve what he hath) <hi>to him shall be given; but to him that hath not, from him shall be taken, even that which he hath.</hi> Well weigh the place and you shall find it so.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="191" facs="tcp:48078:116"/>I know that to depart from ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity so as is required, that is to the utmost degree of the require<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, no man can; for it is a copy too fair for mortal flesh exactly to imitate, while we are in this world. But with good Paper, good Ink, and a good Pen, a skillful and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling man may go far. And 'tis well for thee if thy complaint be sincere; to wit, that thou art troubled that thou canst not forsake iniquity, as thou shouldest: for God accepteth of thy design and desire, and 'tis coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by him as thy kindness.<note place="margin">Pro. 19.22.</note> But if thy complaint in this matter be true, thou wilt not rest, nor content thy self in thy complaints, but wilt, (as he that is truly hungry, or greatly burdened, useth all lawful means to satisfie his hunger, and to ease him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self of his burden) use all thy skill and power to mortifie and keep them under by the word of God. Nor can it otherwise be, but that such a man must be a growing man. <hi>Every branch that beareth fruit,</hi>

            <p>And I would to God this were the sickness of all them that profess in this nation. For then should we soon have a new leaf turned over in most corners of this Nation: Then would graciousness of heart, and life, and conversation be more prized, more sought after, and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter improved, and practised, than it is. Yea, then would the throats of ungodly men be better stopt, and their mouths faster shut up, as to their reproaching of religion, than they are. A Christian man must be the object of the envy of the world; but 'tis better, if the will of God be so,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. &amp; 3 chapters.</note> that we be reproached for well doing, than for evil. If we be reproached for evil doing, 'tis our shame; but if for well doing, 'tis our glory. If we be reproached for our sins, God cannot vindicate us; but if we be reproached for a vertuous life, God himself is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:48078:117"/>
will espouse our quarrel, and in his good time will shew our foes our righteousness, and put them to shame and silence. Briefly, A godly life annexed to faith in Christ, is so necessary that a man that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses the name of Christ, is worse than a beast without it.</p>
            <p>But thou wilt say unto me, <hi>Why do men profess the name of Christ, that love not to depart from iniquity</hi>?</p>
            <p>I answer, There are many reasons for it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The preaching of the Gospel, and so, the publication of the name of Christ, is musical and very ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to the children of men. A Saviour! A Redeemer! A loving sin-pardoning Jesus! What better words can come from man? What better melody can be heard? <hi>Son of man,</hi> said God to the Prophet, <hi>Lo thou art to them as a very lovely Song,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ezek. 33.32.</note> or as a Song of loves, <hi>of one that hath a pleasant voice, and can play well on an instrument.</hi> The Gospel is a most melodious note, and sweet tune, to any that are not prepos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed with slander, reproach and
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:48078:118"/>
enmity against the professors of it. Now its melodious notes being so sweet, no marvel, if it intangle some, even of them (that yet will not depart from iniquity) to take up and profess so lovely a profession. But,</p>
            <p n="2">2. There are a generation of men that are and have been frightned with the law, and terrified with fears of perishing for their sins, but yet have not grace to leave them. Now when the sound of the Gospel shall reach such mens ears, because there is by that made publick the willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Christ to die for sin, and of God to forgive them for his sake; therefore they presently receive and profess those notions, as the only ones that can rid them from their frights and terrors, falsely resting themselves content with that faith thereof, which standeth in naked knowledge; yea, liking of that faith best, that will stand with their pride, Covetousness, and leachery, never desiring to hear of practical holiness, because it will disturb them: wherefore they usually cast dirt at
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:48078:118"/>
such, calling them legal preachers.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Here also is a design of Satan set on foot. For these carnal Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellers, are his <hi>Tares,</hi> the children of the wicked one. Those that he hath sowed among the wheat of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, if possible, that that might be rooted up by beholding and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be vile and filthy of them.<note place="margin">Mat. 13.36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Another cause hereof is this, the Hypocrites that begin to profess, find as bad as themselves already in a profession of this worthy name: and, think they, these do so, and so, and therefore so will I.</p>
            <p n="5">5. This comes to pass also through the righteous judgment of God, who through the anger that he has conceived against some men for their sins, will lift them up to Heaven,<note place="margin">Mat. 11.20, 21, 22, 23, 24.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he casts them down to Hell, that their fall may be the greater, and their punishment the more intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. I have now done, when I have read to you my Text over again; <hi>And let every one that nameth the name of Christ, depart from iniquity.</hi>
