            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>
               <pb facs="tcp:100417:2"/>1 Cor. 15. 23.</head>
            <argument>
               <p>But every Man in his own order: Christ
the first fruits; afterward they that are
Christ's at his coming.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THe Condition of Man in this
world is so limited and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed,
so relative and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect,
that the best things he
does he does weakly, and the
best things he hath are imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
in their very constitution. I need
not tell how little it is that we know; the
greatest indication of this is, That we can
never tell how many things we know not:
and we may soon span our own Knowledge,
but our Ignorance we can never fathom.
Our very Will, in which Mankind pretends
to be most noble and imperial, is a direct
state of imperfection; and our very liberty
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:100417:3"/>
of Chusing good and evil is permitted to us,
not to make us proud, but to make us humble;
for it supposes weakness of Reason and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Love. For if we understood all the
degrees of Amability in the Service of God,
or if we had such love to God as he deserves,
and so perfect a conviction as were fit for his
Services, we could no more Deliberate: For
Liberty of Will is like the motion of a Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netick
Needle toward the North, full of
trembling and uncertainty till it were fixed in
the beloved Point; it wavers as long as it is
free, and is at rest when it can chuse no
more. And truly what is the hope of Man?
It is indeed the resurrection of the Soul in this
world from sorrow and her saddest pressures,
and like the Twilight to the Day, and the
Harbinger of joy; but still it is but a conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of Infirmities, and proclaims our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
calamity, onely because it is uneasie
here, it thrusts us forwards toward the light
and glories of the Resurrection.</p>
            <p>For as a Worm creeping with her belly on
the ground, with her portion and share of
<hi>Adam's</hi> curse, lifts up its head to partake a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
of the blessings of the air, and opens the
junctures of her imperfect body, and curles
her little rings into knots and combinations,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:100417:3"/>
drawing up her tail to a neighbourhood of
the heads pleasure and motion; but still it
must return to abide the fate of its own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and dwell and sleep upon the dust: So
are the hopes of a mortal Man; he opens his
eyes and looks upon fine things at distance,
and shuts them again with weakness, because
they are too glorious to behold; and the
Man rejoyces because he hopes fine things are
staying for him; but his heart akes, because
he knows there are a thousand wayes to fail
and miss of those glories; &amp; though he hopes,
yet he enjoys not; he longs, but he possesses
not, and must be content with his portion of
dust; and being <hi>a worm and no Man</hi> must lie
down in this portion, before he can receive
the end of his hopes, the Salvation of his Soul
in the resurrection of the dead. For as Death
is the end of our lives, so is the Resurrection
the end of our hopes; and as we die daily,
so we daily hope: but Death, which is the
end of our life, is the enlargement of our Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
from hope to certainty, from uncertain
fears to certain expectations, from the death
of the body to the life of the soul; that is, to
partake of the light and life of Christ, to rise
to life as he did; for his Resurrection is the
beginning of ours: He died for us alone, not
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:100417:4"/>
for himself; but he rose again for himself
and us too. So that if he did rise, so shall we;
the Resurrection shall be universal; good and
bad; all shall rise, but not altogether. First
Christ, then we that are Christs; and yet
there is a third Resurrection, though not
spoken of here; but thus it shall be. <hi>The
dead in Christ shall rise first;</hi> that is, next to
Christ; and after them the wicked shall rise
to condemnation.</p>
            <p>So that you see here is the summe of affairs
treated of in my Text: Not whether it be
lawful to eat a Tortoise or a Mushrome, or
to tread with the foot bare upon the ground
within the Octaves of <hi>Easter. It is not here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired</hi>
whether Angels be material or imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial;
or whether the dwellings of dead In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
be within the Air or in the regions of the
Earth; the inquiry here is whether we <hi>are to
be Christians or no? whether we are to live good lives</hi>
or no? or whether it be permitted to us to live
with Lust or Covetousness acted with all the
daughters of rapine and ambition? whether
there be any such thing as sin, any judicato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
for Consciences, any rewards of Piety,
any difference of Good and Bad, any rewards
after this life? <hi>This is the design of these words by
proper interpretation: for if Men shall die like Dogs
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:100417:4"/>
and sheep,</hi> they will certainly live like Wolves
and Foxes: but he that believes the Article
of the Resurrection, hath entertained the
greatest Demonstration in the world, That
nothing can make us happy but the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of God, and Conformity to the life and
death of the holy Jesus. Here therefore are
the great Hinges of all Religion: 1. Christ is
already risen from the dead. 2. We also shall
rise in Gods time and our order. Christ is
the first fruits. But there shall be a full har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest
of the Resurrection, and all shall rise.
My Text speaks onely of the Resurrection of
the just, of them that belong to Christ; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitely
I say of these; and therefore directly
of Resurrection to life eternal. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he also sayes there shall be an order
for every man; and yet every man does not
belong to Christ; therefore indirectly also
he implies the more universal Resurrection
unto judgment. But this shall be the last
thing that shall be done; for, according to the
Proverb of the Jews, <hi>Michael</hi> flies but with one
wing, and <hi>Gabriel</hi> with two; God is quick
in sending Angels of peace, and they flye
apace; but the messengers of wrath come
slowly: God is more hasty to glorifie his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
then to condemn the wicked. <hi>And
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:100417:5"/>
therefore in the story of</hi> Dives <hi>and</hi> Lazarus <hi>we find
that the beggar died first; the good man Lazarus</hi>
was first taken away from his misery to his
comfort, and afterwards the rich man died:
and as the good <hi>many times die first, so all of them
rise first, as if it were a matter</hi> of haste: And as
the mothers breasts swell and shoot and long
to give food to her babe; so Gods <hi>bowels did
yearn over his banish'd children, and he longs to cause
them</hi> to eat and drink in his Kingdom. And
at last the wicked shall rise unto condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
for that must be done too; every man
in his own order: <hi>first Christ, then Christs ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
and at last Christs enemies. The first of
these is the great ground of our faith,</hi> the second is
the consummation of all our hopes: the first
is the foundation of God that stands sure, the
second is that superstructure that shall never
perish: by the first we believe in God unto
righteousness, by the second we live in God
unto salvation: But the third, for that also is
true &amp; must be consider'd, is the great affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of all them that live ungodly. But in the
whole Christs Resurrection and ours is <hi>the
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
                  </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
                  </gap> of a Christian;</hi> that as <hi>Jesus Christ is the
same yesterday and to day, and the same for ever;</hi> so
may we in Christ, become in the morrow of
the Resurrection the same or better then
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:100417:5"/>
yesterday in our natural life; the same body
and the same soul tied together in the same
essential union, with this onely difference,
that not Nature but Grace and Glory with an
Hermetick seal give us a new signature, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
we shall no more be changed, but <hi>like unto
Christ our head we shall become the same for ever.</hi>
Of these I shall discourse in order. 1. <hi>That
Christ, who is the first fruits, is the first in this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der:</hi>
he is already risen from the dead. 2. <hi>We
shall all take our turns, we shall all die,</hi> and as sure
as death we shall all rise again. And 3. <hi>This
very order is effective of the thing it self. That
Christ is first risen, is the demonstration</hi> and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of ours, for because there is an order in
this oeconomy, the first in the kind is the
measure of the rest. If Christ be the first
fruits, we are the whole vintage, and we shall
all die in the order of Nature, and shall rise
again in the order of Christ: They that are
Christ's, and are found so at his coming, shall
partake of his resurrection. But Christ first,
then they that are Christ's: that's the order.</p>
            <p>1. Christ is the first fruits; he is already
risen from the dead. For he alone could not
be held by death. <hi>Free among the dead.</hi>

Death was Sins eldest daughter, and the
Grave-clothes were her first mantle; but
Christ was conquerour over both, and came
to take that away, and to disarm this. This
was a glory fit for the head of mankind, but
it was too great and too good to be easily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd
by incredulous and weak-hearted Man.
It was at first doubted of by all that were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned;
but they that saw it had no reason
to doubt any longer. But what's that to us
who saw it not? Yes, very much. <hi>Valde dubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatum
est ab illis, ne dubitaretur Ã  nobis,</hi> saith S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine.</hi>
They doubted very much, that by
their confirmation we might be established
and doubt no more. <hi>Mary Magdalene</hi> saw him
first, and she ran with joy and <hi>said she had seen
the Lord, and that he was risen from the dead; but
they believed her not. After that divers women to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
saw him,</hi> and they told it, but had no
thanks for their pains, and obtain'd no credit
among the Disciples. <hi>The two Disciples that
went to</hi> Emaus <hi>saw him,</hi> talk'd with him, eat
with him, and they ran and told it: they
told true, but no body believ'd them. <hi>Then</hi>
S. Peter <hi>saw him, but he was not yet got into the
Chair of the Catholick Church, they did not think him</hi>
infallible, and so they believ'd him not at all.
Five times in one day he appear'd; for after
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:100417:6"/>
all this he appear'd to the Eleven; they were
indeed transported with joy and wonder, but
they would scarce believe their own eyes, and
though they saw him they doubted. Well,
all this was not enough; he was seen also of
<hi>Iames,</hi> and suffered <hi>Thomas</hi> to thrust his hand
into his side, and appeared to S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and
was seen by <hi>five hundred brethren at once.</hi> So
that there is no capacity of mankind, no
time, no place, but had an ocular demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
of his Resurrection. He appeared
to Men and Women, to the Clergy and the
Laity, <hi>to sinners of both sexes; to weak men and
to criminals, to doubters and deniers, at home and
abroad, in publick and in private,</hi> in their houses
and their journeys, unexpected and by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment,
betimes in the morning and late
at night, to them in conjunction and to them
in dispersion, when they did look for him
and when they did not; he <hi>appeared upon earth
to many, and to S.</hi> Paul <hi>and S.</hi> Stephen <hi>from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
So that we can require no greater testimony
then all these</hi> are able to give us, and they saw
for themselves and for us too, <hi>that the Faith and
certainty of the Resurrection of Iesus</hi> might be
conveyed to all that shall die and follow
Christ in their own order.</p>
            <p>Now this being matter of fact, cannot be
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:100417:7"/>
suppos'd infinite, but limited to time and
place, and therefore to be prov'd by them
who at that time were upon the place; good
men and true, simple and yet losers by the
bargain, many and united, confident and
constant, preaching it all their life, and stout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
maintaining it at their death. Men that
would not deceive others, and <hi>Men that could
not be deceiv'd themselves in a matter so notorious
and so prov'd, and so seen: and if this be not suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
credibility in a matter of Fact as</hi> this was, then
we can <hi>have no story credibly transmitted to us, no
Records kept, no</hi> Acts of Courts, no narratives
of the dayes of old, no traditions of our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
no memorials of them in the third ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration.
Nay, if from these we have not
sufficient <hi>causes and arguments of Faith, how shall
we be able to know the will of Heaven upon Earth?
unless God do not only tell it once,</hi> but alwayes,
and not only alwayes to some Men, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
to all Men: for if some Men must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
others, they can never do it in any thing
more reasonably than in this; and if we may
not trust them in this, then without a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
miracle, no Man could have Faith: <hi>for
Faith could never come by hearing; by nothing but
by seeing.</hi> But if there be any use of History,
any Faith in Men, any honesty in manners,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:100417:7"/>
any truth in humane entercourse; if there
be any use of Apostles or Teachers, of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors,
or Letters, of ears or hearing; if
there be any such thing as the Grace of Faith,
that is less than demonstration or intuition,
then we may be as sure that Christ the first
Fruits is already risen, as all these credibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
can make us. <hi>But let us take heed; as God
hates a lie, so he hates incredulity; an obstinate, a
foolish and pertinacious</hi> understanding. What
we do every minute of our lives in matters of
title and great concernment, if we refuse to do
it in Religion, which yet is to be conducted
as all humane affairs are, by humane instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and arguments of perswasion proper
to the nature of the thing, it is an obstinacy
as cross to humane reason, as it is to Divine
Faith.</p>
            <p>But this Article was so clearly prov'd, that
presently it came to pass that Men were no
longer asham'd of the Cross, but it was
worn upon breasts, printed in the air, drawn
upon foreheads, carried upon Banners, put
upon crowns Imperial, presently it came to
pass that the Religion of the despised Jesus
did infinitely prevail: a Religion that taught
Men to be meek and humble, apt to receive
injuries, but unapt to do any; a Religion
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:100417:8"/>
that gave countenance to the poor and piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
in a time when riches were ador'd, and
ambition and pleasure had possessed the heart
of all Mankind; a Religion that would
change the face of things, and the hearts of
Men, and break vile habits into gentleness
and counsel; that such a Religion, in such a
time by the Sermons and Conduct of Fisher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
Men of mean breeding and illiberal
Arts, should so speedily triumph over the
Philosophy of the World, and the arguments
of the subtil, and the Sermons of the Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent;
the Power of Princes and the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests
of States, the inclinations of Nature,
and the blindness of zeal, the force of custom,
and the sollicitation of passions, the pleasures
of sin and the busie Arts of the Devil; that
is, against Wit and Power, Superstition and
Wilfulness, Fame and Money, Nature and
Empire, which are all the causes in this
World that can make a thing impossible; this,
this is to be ascrib'd to the power of God, and
is the great demonstration of the Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Jesus. Every thing was an Argument
for it, and improv'd it; no Objection could
hinder it, no Enemies destroy it; whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
was for them, it made the Religion to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease;
whatsoever was against them, made
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:100417:8"/>
it to increase; Sun-shine and Storms, Fair
Weather or Foul, it was all one as to the event
of things: for they were instruments in the
hands of God, who could make what himself
should chuse to be the product of any cause;
So that if the Christians had peace, they went
abroad and brought in Converts; if they had
no peace, but persecution; the Converts
came in to them. In prosperity they allur'd
and intic'd the World by the beauty of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
in affliction and trouble they amaz'd all
men with the splendour of their Innocence,
and the glories of their patience; and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
it was that the World became Disciple to
the glorious <hi>Nazarene,</hi> and men could no
longer doubt of the Resurrection of Jesus,
when it became so demonstrated by the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of them that saw it, and the courage
of them that died for it, and the multitude of
them that believ'd it; who by their Sermons,
and their Actions, by their publick Offices and
Discourses, by Festivals and Eucharists, by
Arguments of Experience and Sense, by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
and Religion, by perswading rational
Men, and establishing believing Christians,
by their living in the obedience of Jesus, and
dying for the testimony of Jesus, have greatly
advanc'd his Kingdom, and his Power, and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:100417:9"/>
his Glory, into which he entred after his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection
from the dead. For he is the first
fruits; and if we hope to rise through him,
we must confess that himself is first risen
from the dead. That's the first particular.</p>
            <p>2. There is an order for us also. We also
shall rise again.
<q>
                  <l>CombustÃºsque senex tumulo procedit adultus,</l>

The ashes of old <hi>Camillus</hi> shall stand up sprite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
from his Urne; and the Funeral fires
shall produce a new warmth to the dead
bones of all those who died under the arms
of all the Enemies of the Roman greatness.
This is a less wonder than the former: for
<hi>admonetur omnis aetas jam fieri posse quod aliquando
factum est.</hi> If it was done once, it may be
done again; for since it could never have
been done, but by a power that is infinite,
that infinite must also be eternal and indefici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent.
By the same Almighty power which
restor'd life to the dead body of our living
Lord, we may all be restor'd to a new life in
the Resurrection of the dead.</p>
            <p>When Man was not, what power, what
causes made him to be? whatsoever it was,
it did then as great a work as to raise his body
to the same being again; and because we
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:100417:9"/>
know not the method of Natures secret chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
and how we can be fashioned beneath <hi>in
secreto terrae,</hi> and cannot handle and discern
the possibilities and seminal powers in the
ashes of dissolved bones, must our ignorance
in Philosophy be put in balance against the
Articles of Religion, the hopes of Mankind,
the Faith of Nations and the truth of God?
and are our Opinions of the power of God so
low, that our understanding must be his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure;
and he shall be confessed to do nothing,
unless it be made plain in our Philosophy?
Certainly we have a low Opinion of God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
we believe he can do more things then
we can understand. But let us hear S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s
demonstration: If the Corn dies and lives
again; if it layes its body down, suffers alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
dissolution and death, but at the
spring rises again in the verdure of a leaf, in
the fulness of the ear, in the kidneys of wheat;
if it proceeds from little to great, from na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedness
to ornament, from emptiness to plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
from unity to multitude, from death to
life: be a Sadducee no more, shame not thy
understanding, and reproch not the weakness
of thy Faith, by thinking that Corn can be
restor'd to life and Man cannot; especially
since in every creature the obediential capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:100417:10"/>
is infinite, and cannot admit degrees;
for every Creature can be any thing under the
power of God, which cannot be less than in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite.</p>
            <p>But we find no obscure foot-steps of this
mystery even amongst the Heathens. <hi>Pliny</hi>
reports that <hi>Appion</hi> the Grammarian by the
use of the plant <hi>Osiris</hi> call'd <hi>Homer</hi> from his
grave; and in <hi>Valerius Maximus</hi> we find that
<hi>AElius Tubero</hi> return'd to life when he was
seated in his Funeral pile; and in <hi>Plutarch,</hi>
that <hi>Soleus</hi> after three dayes burial did live,
and in <hi>Valerius</hi> that <hi>AEris Pamphilius</hi> did so af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ten dayes. And it was so commonly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd,
that <hi>Glaucus</hi> who was choked in a ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel
of honey did rise again, that it grew to a
Proverb; <hi>Glaucus poto melle resurrexit; Glaucus</hi>
having tasted honey, died and liv'd again.
I pretend not to believe these stories true;
<hi>but from these instances it may be concluded that</hi>
they believ'd it possible that there should be a
Resurrection from the dead; and natural
reason, and their Philosophy did not wholly
destroy their hopes and expectation to have
a portion in this Article.</p>
            <p>For God knowing that the great hopes of
Man, that the biggest endearment of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
the sanction of private Justice, the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:100417:10"/>
band of Piety and holy Courage, <hi>does wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
from the Article of the Resurrection,</hi> was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
not onely to make it credible, but easie
and familiar to us; and we so converse every
night with the Image of death, that every
morning we find an argument of the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.

sleep our Senses are as fast bound by Nature;
as our Joynts are by the grave-clothes; and
unless an <hi>Angel of God awaken us every morning,
we must confess</hi> our selves as unable to converse
with Men, as we now are afraid to die and to
converse with Spirits. But however Death
it self is no more; it is but darkness and a
<hi>shadow, a rest and a forgetfulness. What is there
more in death? what is</hi> there less in sleep? For
do we not see by experience that nothing of
equal loudness does awaken us <hi>sooner then a
Mans voice, especially if he be call'd by name?</hi> and
thus also it shall be in the Resurrection. We
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:100417:11"/>
shall be awakened by the voice of a Man, and
he that call'd <hi>Lazarus</hi> by name from his
grave, shall also call us: for although S.<hi>Paul</hi>
affirms,<note place="margin">1 Thes. 4. 16.</note> 
               <hi>that the trumpet shall sound, and there
shall be the voice of an Archangel;</hi> yet this is not
a word of Nature, but of Office and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry:
Christ himself is that Archangel, and
<hi>he shall descend with a mighty shout,</hi>
               <note place="margin">John 5. 28.</note> (saith the
Apostle) <hi>and all that are in the grave shall hear
his voice,</hi> saith S. <hi>John:</hi> So that we shall be
awakened by the voice of a Man, because we
are onely fallen asleep by the decree of God;
and when the Cock and the Lark call us up
to prayer and labour, the first thing we see is
an argument of our Resurrection from the
dead. And when we consider what the
Greek Church reports, That amongst them
the bodies of those that die Excommunicate
will not return to dust till the Censure be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
off; we may with a little faith and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
believe, that the same power that keeps
them from their natural Dissolution, can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
them to life and union. I will not now
insist upon the story of the Rising Bones seen
every year in <hi>Egypt,</hi> nor the pretences of the
Chymists, that they from the ashes of Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
can re-produce from the same materials
the same beauties in colour and figure; for

he that proves a certain Truth from an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain

but if he serv'd God, he also relied up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

               </gap>, they
who had no hope (meaning of the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection)
were also Atheists, and without
God in the world. And it is remarkable
what S. <hi>Augustine observes, That when the World
saw the righteous</hi> Abel <hi>destroyed, and that the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer
out-liv'd</hi> his crime, and built up a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous
family, and grew mighty upon
Earth, they neglected the Service of God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that account, till God in pity of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
and foolish arguings took <hi>Enoch</hi> up to
heaven to recover them from their <hi>impieties, by
shewing them that their bodies and souls should be
rewarded</hi> for ever in an eternal union. But
Christ the first fruits is gone before, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<hi>did promise that when himself was lifted up he
would</hi> draw all men after him. <hi>Every man in
his own order;</hi> first Christ, then <hi>they that are
Christ's at his coming.</hi> And so I have done with
the second Particular, not Christ onely, but
we also shall rise in Gods time and our
order.</p>
            <p>But concerning this order I must speak a
word or two, not only for the fuller handling
the Text, but because it will be matter of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:100417:12"/>
of what hath been already spoken
of the Article of the Resurrection.</p>
            <p>3. First Christ and then we. And we
therefore because Christ is already risen. But
you must remember, <hi>that the Resurrection and
Exaltation of Christ was the reward</hi> of his perfect
obedience and purest holiness; and he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
us to an imitation of the <hi>same obedience, and
the same perfect holiness, prepares a way</hi> for us to
the same Resurrection. If we by holiness
become the Sons of God as Christ was, we
shall also as he was become the Sons of
God in the Resurrection: But upon no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
terms. So said our blessed Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self:
<hi>Ye which have followed me in the regeneration,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 14. 14.</note>
               <hi>when the Son of Man shall sit on the throne of his
glory, ye also shall sit upon thrones judging the tribes
of Israel.</hi> For as it was with Christ the first
fruits, so it shall be with all Christians in
their own order: as with the Head, so it shall
be with the Members. He was the Son of
God by love and obedience, and then became
the Son of God by Resurrection from the
dead to life Eternal, and so shall we; but we
cannot be so in any other way. To them
that are Christ's, and to none else shall this
be given. For we must know that God
hath sent Christ into the World to be a great
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:100417:13"/>
example and demonstration of the Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy
and Dispensation of Eternal life.
As God brought Christ to glory, so he will
bring us, but by no other method. He first
obeyed the will of God, and patiently suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the will of God; he died, and rose again,
and entered into glory; and so must we.
Thus Christ is made <hi>Via, Veritas, &amp; Vita,</hi> the
Way, the Truth, and the Life; that is, the
true way to Eternal life: He first trode this
Wine-press, and we must insist in the same
steps, or we shall never partake of this bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Resurrection. He was made the Son of
God in a most glorious manner, and we by
him, by his merit, and by his grace, and by
his example: but other then this there is no
way of Salvation for us. That's the first and
great effect of this glorious order.</p>
            <p>4. But there is one thing more in it yet,
<hi>Every Man in his own order.</hi> First Christ, and
then <hi>they that are Christ</hi>'s. But what shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
of them that are not Christ's? why
there is an order for them too. First, they that
are Christ's; and then they that are not his.
<note n="*" place="margin">Rev. 20. 6.</note>
               <hi>Blessed and holy is he that hath his part in the first

even after this life. <hi>The dead in

the wicked from their graves, it is no
otherwise in the sense of the Spirit to be called
a Resurrection, then taking a Criminal from
the Prison to the Bar is a giving of liberty.
When poor <hi>Attilius Aviola</hi> had been seized on
by an Apoplexy, his friends supposing him
dead carried him to his Funeral pile; but
when the fire began to approch, and the heat
to warm the body, he reviv'd, and seeing
himself incircled with Funeral flames, call'd
out aloud to his friends to rescue, not the
dead, but <hi>the living</hi> Aviola <hi>from that horrid bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.
But it could not be. He onely was restor'd
from his sickness to fall into death, and from
his dull disease to a sharp and intolerable torment.</hi>
Just so shall the wicked live again; they shall
receive their souls, that they may be a portion
for Devils; they shall receive their bodies,
that they may feel the everlasting burning;
they shall see Christ, that they may <hi>look on
him whom they have pierced;</hi> and they shall hear
the voice of God passing upon them the into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable
sentence; they shall come from their
graves, that they may go into hell; and live
again, that they may die for ever. So have
we seen a poor condemned Criminal, the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:100417:14"/>
weight of whose sorrows sitting heavily up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his soul hath benummed him into a deep
sleep, till he hath forgotten his grones, and
laid aside his deep sighings; but on a sudden
comes the messenger of death, and unbinds
the Poppy garland, scatters the heavy cloud
that incircled his miserable head, and makes
him return to acts of life, that he may quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
descend into death and be no more. So is
every sinner that lies down in shame, and
makes his grave with the wicked; he shall
indeed rise again, and be called upon by the
voice of the Archangel, but then he shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend
into sorrows greater then the reason and
the patience of a man, weeping and shrieking
louder then the grones of the miserable chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
in the Valley of <hi>Hinnon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These indeed are sad stories, but true as
the voice of God and the Sermons of the holy
Jesus. They are Gods words and Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees;
and I wish that all who profess the
belief of these, would consider sadly what
they mean. If ye believe the Article of the
Resurrection, then you know that in your
body you shall receive what you did in the
body, whether it be good or bad. It matters
not now very much whether our bodies be
beauteous or deformed; for if we glorifie God
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:100417:14"/>
in our bodies, God shall make our bodies glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.
It matters not much whether we
live in ease and pleasure, or eat nothing but
bitter herbs: the body <hi>that lies in dust and
ashes, that goes stooping and feeble,</hi> that lodges
at the foot of the Cross and dwells in disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
shall be <hi>feasted at the eternal supper of the
Lamb.</hi> And ever remember this, that beast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
pleasures, and lying lips, and a deceitful
tongue, and a heart that sendeth forth proud
things, are no good dispositions to a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Resurrection.

said <hi>Phocyllides;</hi> for we hope that from
our beds of darkness we shall rise into Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of light, and shall become like unto God.
They shall partake of a Resurrection to life
and what this can infer is very obvious. For i<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
it be so hard to believe a Resurrection from
one death, let us not be dead in trespasses and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:100417:15"/>
sins, for a Resurrection from two deaths will
be harder to be believ'd, and harder to be
effected. But if any of you have lost the life
of Grace, and so forfeited all your title to a
life of Glory, betake your selves to an early
and an entire piety, that when by this first
Resurrection you have made this way plain
before your face, you may with confidence
expect a happy Resurrection from your
graves. For if it be possible that the spirit,
when it is dead in sin, can arise to a life of
righteousness; much more it is easie to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
that the body after death is capable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
restor'd again. And this is a consequent
of S. <hi>Pauls</hi> argument,<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 10.</note> 
               <hi>If when ye were enemies ye
were reconciled by his death, much more being recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled

that it is a harder and more wonderful
thing for a wicked man to become the friend
of God, then for one that is so, to be carried
up to heaven and partake of his glory. The
first Resurrection is certainly the greater mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle:
But he that hath risen once, may rise
again; and this is as sure as that he that dies
once, may die again, and die for ever. But
he who partakes of the death of Christ by
Mortification, and of his Resurrection by
holiness of life and a holy Faith, shall, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:100417:15"/>
to the expression of the Prophet <hi>Isaiah,
Enter into his chamber of death;</hi> when Nature<note place="margin">Isa. 26. 20.</note>
and Gods decree <hi>shall shut the doors upon him, and
there he shall be hidden for a little moment:</hi> But
then shall they that dwell in dust awake and
sing, with Christs dead body shall they arise:
all shall rise, but <hi>every man in his own order;
Christ the first fruits, then they that are Christs at
his coming.</hi> Amen.</p>
            <p>I have now done with my Meditation of
the Resurrection; but we have a new and a
sadder subject to consider: It is glorious and
brave when a Christian contemplates those
glories which stand at the foot of the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of all God's Servants; but when we
consider, that before all or any thing of this
happens every Christian must <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>wice <hi>exuere
hominem,</hi> put off the Old man, and then lie
down in dust and the dishonours of the
Grave, it is <hi>Vinum Myrrhatum,</hi> there is Myrrhe
put into our Wine; it is wholsom, but it will
allay all our pleasures of that glorious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation.
But no man can escape it. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that the Great <hi>Cyrus</hi> had rul'd long in a
mighty Empire; yet there came a Message
from Heaven, not so sad it may be, yet as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretory
as the Hand-writing on the wall that
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:100417:16"/>
arrested his Successor <hi>Darius,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
               </gap>
Prepare thy self, O <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and
then go unto the Gods; he laid aside his Tiar
and his beauteous Diadem, and cover'd his
face with a cloth, and in a single Linen laid
his honour'd head in a poor humble
Grave; and none of us all can avoid this sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.
For if Wit and Learning, great Fame
and great Experience, if wise Notices of
things, and an honourable Fortune, if Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
and Skill, if Prelacy and an honourable
Age, if any thing that could give Greatness
and Immunity to a wise and prudent man,
could have been put in bar against a sad day,
and have gone for good plea, this sad Scene
of Sorrows had not been the entertainment
of this Assembly. But tell me, where are
those great Masters, who while they liv'd
flourish'd in their studies? <hi>Iam eorum praeben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das
alii possident, &amp; nescio utrum de iis cogitant;</hi>
Other men have got their Prebends and their
Dignities, and who knows whether ever
they remember them or no? While they
liv'd they seem'd nothing, when they are
dead, every man for a while speaks of them
what they please, and afterwards they are as
if they had not been. But the piety of the
Christian Church hath made some little pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:100417:16"/>
towards an artificial Immortality for
brave and worthy persons; and the Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships,
which our dead contracted while they
were alive, require us to continue a fair me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
as long as we can; but they expire in
monethly minds, or at most in a saint and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining
Anniversary;

And we have great reason so to do in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
sad accident of the death of our late most
Reverend Primate, whose death the Church
of <hi>Ireland</hi> hath very great reason to deplore;
and we have great obligation to remember
his very many worthy Deeds done for this
poor afflicted and despised Church. S. <hi>Paul</hi>
made an excellent Funeral Oration, as it were
instituting a Feast of All Saints, <hi>Who all died
having obtained a good report;</hi> and that excellent
Preacher in the 11. chap. of the <hi>Hebrews</hi>
made a Sermon of their Commemoration.
For since good men, while they are alive,
have their conversation in Heaven; when
they are in Heaven 'tis also fit that they should
in their good names live upon Earth. And
as their great Examples are an excellent Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to the living, and the praising them
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:100417:17"/>
when Envy and Flattery can have no Interest
to interpose, as it is the best and most vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Sermon and Incentive to great things;
so to conceal what good God hath wrought
by them, is great unthankfulness to God and
to good men.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Dorcas</hi> died the Apostle came to see
the dead Corps, and the friends of the decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
expressed their grief and their love by
shewing the Coats that she, whilest she li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
wrought with her own hands. She
was a good Needle-woman and a good Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife,
and did good to Mankind in her little
way, and that it self ought not to be forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
and the Apostle himself was not displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
with their little Sermons, and that

               </gap> which the women made upon that
sad interview. But if we may have the same
liberty to record the worthy things of this
our most venerable Father and Brother, and
if there remains no more of that Envy which
usually obscures the splendour of living He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro's,
if you can with your charitable though
weeping eyes behold the great gifts of God
with which he adorned this great Prelate,
and not object the failings of Humanity to
the participation of the Graces of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
or think that Gods gifts are the lesse

pay this duty to Piety, and Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
and Thankfulness, and deplore our sad
loss by telling a true and sad story of this
great man, whom God hath lately taken from
our eyes.</p>
            <p>He was bred in <hi>Cambridge</hi> in <hi>Sidney-college</hi>
under Mr. <hi>Hulet,</hi> a grave and a worthy man,
and he shewed himself not onely a fruitful
Plant by his great progress in his Studies, but
made him another return of gratitude, taking
care to provide a good Imployment for him
in <hi>Ireland,</hi> where he then began to be greatly
interested. It was spoken as an honour to
<hi>Augustus Caesar,</hi> that he gave his Tutor an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
Funeral; and <hi>Marcus Antoninus</hi> erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a Statue unto his; and <hi>Gratian</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
made his Master <hi>Ausonius</hi> to be <hi>Consul:</hi>
And our worthy Primate, knowing the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
which they pass upon us, who do
<hi>Obstetricari gravidae animae,</hi> help the parturient
Soul to bring forth fruits according to its se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal
powers, was careful not onely to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the industry of such persons so useful to
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:100417:18"/>
the Church in the cultivating <hi>infantes palma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi>
young Plants, whose joynts are to be
stretch'd and made streight; but to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
that his Scholar knew how to value
Learning, when he knew so well how to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the Teacher.</p>
            <p>Having pass'd the course of his studies in
the University, and done his Exercise with
that Applause which is usually the reward of
pregnant Wits and hard study, he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd
into <hi>York-shire;</hi> where first in the City
of <hi>York</hi> he was an assiduous Preacher, but by
the disposition of the Divine Providence he
happened to be engaged at <hi>North-Alerton</hi> in
Disputation with three pragmatical Romish
Priests of the Jesuits Order, whom he so
much worsted in the Conference, and so
shamefully disadvantaged by the evidence of
Truth, represented wisely and learnedly,
that the famous Primate of <hi>York,</hi> Archbishop
<hi>Matthews,</hi> a learned and an excellent Prelate,
and a most worthy Preacher, hearing of that
Triumph, sent for him and made him his
Chaplain; in whose service he continued
till the death of the Primate, but in that
time had given so much testimony of his great
Dexterity in the Conduct of Ecclesiastical and
Civil Affairs, that he grew dear to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:100417:18"/>
In that Imployment he was made Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bendary
of <hi>York,</hi> and then of <hi>Rippon;</hi> the Dean
of which Church having made him his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Dean,
he managed the affairs of that Church
so well, that he soon acquir'd a greater fame,
and entered into the possession of many
hearts, and admiration to those many more
that knew him. There and at his Parsonage
he continued long to do the duty of a learned
and good Preacher, and by his Wisdom, Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
and Deportment, so gain'd the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of the Nobility, Gentry and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
of that Countrey, that as at his return
thither upon the blessed Restauration of His
most Sacred Majesty he knew himself ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
enough, and was so kind as to give them
a Visit; so they by their coming in great
numbers to meet him, their joyful Reception
of him, their great Caressing of him when he
was there, their forward hopes to enjoy him
as their Bishop, their trouble at his Depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
their unwillingness to let him go away,
gave signal testimonies that they were wise
and kind enough to understand and value his
great worth.</p>
            <p>But while he lived there he was like a Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond
in the dust, (or <hi>Lucius Quinctius at the
plough</hi>) his low Fortune covered a most
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:100417:19"/>
valuable person, till he became observ'd by
Sir <hi>Thomas Wentworth</hi> Lord President of <hi>York,</hi>
whom we all knew for his great Excellencies,
and his great but glorious Misfortunes. This
rare person espied the great abilities of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
<hi>Bramhall,</hi> and made him his Chaplain,
and brought him into <hi>Ireland</hi> as one whom he
believ'd would prove the most fit instrument
to serve in that design, which for two years
before his arrival here he had greatly medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and resolved, the Reformation of Religion
and the Reparation of the broken Fortunes of
the Church: The Complaints were many,
the Abuses great, the Causes of the Church
vastly numerous, but as fast as they were
brought in, so fast they were by the Lord
Deputy referred back to Dr. <hi>Bramhall,</hi> who
by his indefatigable Pains, great Sagacity,
perpetual Watchfulness, daily and hourly
Consultations, reduc'd things to a more tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
condition then they had been left in by
the Schismatical principles of some, and the
unjust Prepossessions of others, form any years
before. For at the Reformation the Popish
Bishops and Priests seemed to conform, and
did so, that keeping their Bishopricks they
might enrich their Kindred and dilapidate
the Revenues of the Church; which by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:100417:19"/>
Offices, false Informations, Fee-farms
at contemptible Rents, and ungodly Aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
were made low as Poverty it self, and
unfit to minister to the needs of them that
serv'd the Altar, or the noblest purposes of
Religion. For Hospitality decayed, and the
Bishops were easie to be oppressed by those
that would; and they complained, but for a
long time had no helper, till God raised up
that glorious Instrument the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi>
who brought over with him as great affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to the Church and to all publick Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ests,
and as admirable Abilities, as ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his time did invest and adorn any of the
Kings Vicegerents: and God fitted his hand
with an Instrument good as his skill was
great. For the first Specimen of his Abilities
and Diligence in recovery of some lost Tithes
being represented to His late Majesty of bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
and glorious memory, it pleased His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
upon the death of Bishop <hi>Downham</hi> to
advance the Doctor to the Bishoprick of

                  </gap>y;</hi> which he not onely adorned with an
excellent spirit and a wise Government, but
did more then double the Revenue, not
by taking any thing from them to whom
it was due, but by resuming something
of the Churches Patrimony, which by
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:100417:20"/>
undue means was detained in unfitting
hands.</p>
            <p>But his care was beyond his Diocese, and
his zele broke out to warm all his Brethren;
and though by reason of the Favour and Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of King <hi>Iames</hi> the escheated Counties were
well provided for their Tithes, yet the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shopricks
were not so well till the Primate,
then Bishop of <hi>Derry,</hi> by the favour of the
Lord Lieutenant and his own incessant and
assiduous labour and wise conduct, brought
in divers Impropriations, cancell'd many
unjust Alienations, and did restore them to a
condition much more tolerable; I say much
more tolerable; for though he rais'd them
above contempt, yet they were not near to
envy; but he knew there could not in all
times be wanting too many that envied to the
Church every degree of prosperity: so <hi>Iudas</hi>
did to Christ the expence of Oyntment, and
so <hi>Dyonisius</hi> told the Priest, when himself stole
the golden Cloak from <hi>Apollo,</hi> and gave him
one of Arcadian home-spun, that it was
warmer for him in Winter and cooler in
Summer. And forever, since the Church by
God's blessing and the favour of Religious
Kings and Princes, and Pious Nobility, hath
been endowed with fair Revenues; <hi>inimicus
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:100417:20"/>

pretences of Religion to take away God's

had as little to do, and much less than a

represent upon what great and Religious
grounds the then Bishop of <hi>Derry</hi> did with so
much care and assiduous labour endeavour to
restore the Church of <hi>Ireland</hi> to that splendor
and fulness; which as it is much conducing
to the honour of God and of Religion, God
himself being the Judge, so it is much more
necessary for you than it is for us, and so this
wise Prelate rarely well understood it; and
having the same advantage and blessing as we
now have, a Gracious King, and a Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
Patron of Religion, and the Church, he

               </note> which the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the ancient Princes and Nobles of this
Kingdom had bountifully given to such a
comfortable competency, that though there
be place left for present and future Piety to
inlarge it self, yet no man hath reason to be
discourag'd in his duty; insomuch that as I
have heard from a most worthy hand, that
at his going into <hi>England</hi> he gave account to
the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> of 30000 l. a
year, in the recovery of which he was greatly
and principally instrumental. But the goods
of this World are called waters by <hi>Solomon.</hi>
Stollen waters are sweet, and they are too
unstable to be stopt: some of these waters
did run back from their proper chanel, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to another course than God and the
Laws intended, yet his labours and pious
Counsels were not the less acceptable to God
and good men, and therefore by a thankful
and honourable recognition the Convocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Church of <hi>Ireland</hi> hath transmitted
in Record to posterity their deep resentment
of his singular services and great abilities in
this whole affair. And this honour will for
ever remain to that Bishop of <hi>Derry;</hi> he had
a <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> who repair'd the Temple and

High-priest, who under him ministred this
blessing to the Congregations of the Lord.</p>
            <p>But his care was not determin'd in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour
part onely, and Accessaries of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;
he was careful, and he was prosperous
in it, to reduce that Divine and excellent Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of our Church to publick and constant
Exercise, to Unity and Devotion; and to
cause the Articles of the Church of <hi>England</hi> to
be accepted as the Rule of publick confessions
and perswasions here, that they and we might
be <hi>Populus unius labii,</hi> of one heart and one lip,
building up our hopes of heaven on a most

which made this Church lisp too undecently,
or rather in some little degree to speak the
speech of <hi>Ashdod,</hi> and not the language of

to defend his Temple by their Arms, so he
would defend their Persons and that Cause
with his Power and Divinity. And this
excellent man in the Cause of Religion
found the like blessing which they prayed
for; God by the prosperity of his labours
and a blessed effect gave testimony not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of the Piety and Wisdom of his purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
but that he loves to bless a wise Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
when it is vigorously imployed in a

were made even from Religion it self to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct

Religion.</p>
            <p>These were great things and matter of

His zele for recovery of the Church-revenues
was call'd Oppression and Rapine, Covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness

production of Illiberal Arts and ways of get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting;

bear all that reproch which Jealousie and

Enemies were asham'd and convinc'd; they
found they had done like <hi>AEsops</hi> Viper,

to subvert the fundamental Laws; the

the Romans call'd Retiaries, when they

likely to be oppress'd with numbers and
despair, sent what rescue he could, his Royal

persecution. So necessary it was for them,
who intended to do mischief to the publick,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:100417:25"/>
to take away the strongest pillars of the house.
This thing I remark to acquit this great man
from the tongue of slander, which had so
boldly spoken, that it was certain something
would stick, yet was so impotent and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arm'd,
that it could not kill that great same

            <p>Every thing can have an ill name and an

care of reputations as he does of lives, by the
orders of his providence confutes the slander,
<hi>ut memoria justorum sit in benedictionibus,</hi> that the
memory of the righteous man might be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balm'd
with honour: And so it hapned to this
great man; for by a publick Warranty, by
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:100417:25"/>
the concurrent consent of both Houses of
Parliament, the Libellous Petitions against
him, the false Records and publick Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of injurious shame were cancell'd, and
he was restor'd <hi>in integrum</hi> to that fame where
his great labours and just procedures had first
estated him; which, though it was but ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
yet it was also such honour, that it is
greater then the virulence of tongues, which
his worthiness and their envy had arm'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him.</p>
            <p>But yet the great scene of the troubles was
but newly open'd. I shall not refuse to speak
yet more of his troubles, as remembring that
St. <hi>Paul,</hi> when he discourses of the glories of
the Saints departed, he tells more of their
sufferings than of their prosperities, as being
that Laboratory and Crysable in which God
makes his Servants vessels of honour to his
glory. The storm quickly grew high; <hi>&amp;

Neale</hi> laid a snare to bring him to a dishonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:100417:26"/>
death. For he wrote a Letter to the
Bishop, pretended Intelligence between
them, desir'd that according to their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
agreement such a Gate might be deliver'd
to him. The messenger was not advis'd to
be cautious, not at all instructed in the art of
Secrecy, for it was intended that he should
be search'd, intercepted and hang'd for ought
they car'd: but the Arrow was shot against
the Bishop, that he might be accused for
base Conspiracy, and die with shame and
sad dishonour. But here God manifested
his mighty care of his Servants; he was
pleas'd to send into the heart of the messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
such an affrightment, that he directly
ran away with the Letter, and never durst
come near the Town to deliver it. This
story was publish'd by <hi>Sir Phelim</hi> himself,
who added, That if he could have thus en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>snar'd
the Bishop, he had good assurance the
Town should have been his own: <hi>Sed bonitas
Dei praevalitura est super omnem malitiam hominis,</hi>
The goodness of God is greater then all the
malice of Men; and nothing could so prove
how dear that sacred Life was to God, as his
rescue from the dangers. <hi>Stantia non poterant
tecta probare Deos:</hi> To have kept him in a
warm house had been nothing, unless the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:100417:26"/>
roof had fallen upon his head, that rescue
was a remark of Divine favour and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.
But it seems Sir <hi>Phelim</hi>'s Treason
against the Life of this worthy Man had a
Correspondent in the Town; and it broke
out speedily; for what they could not effect
by malicious stratagem, they did in part by
open force; they turn'd the Bishop out of the
Town, and upon trifling and unjust preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
search'd his Carriages, and took what
they pleas'd, till they were asham'd to take
more: they did worse then divorce him from
his Church, for in all the Roman Divorces
they said, <hi>Tuas tibi res babeto,</hi> Take your goods
and be gone; but Plunder was Religion then.
However, though the usage was sad, yet it
was recompenc'd to him by his taking San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary
in <hi>Oxford,</hi> where he was graciously re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
by that most incomparable and divine
Prince; but having served the King in <hi>York<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire</hi>
by his Pen, and by his Counsels, and by
his Interests, return'd back to <hi>Ireland,</hi> where
under the excellent conduct of his Grace the
now Lord Lieutenant, he ran the risque and
fortune of oppressed Vertue.</p>
            <p>But God having still resolv'd to afflict us,
the good-man was forc'd into the fortune of
the Patriarchs, to leave his Countrey and his
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:100417:27"/>
Charges, and seek for safety and bread in a
strange Land; for so the Prophets were us'd
to do, wandring up and down in sheeps-clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
but poor as they were the world was
not worthy of them; and this worthy man,
despising the shame, took up his Cross and
followed his Master.

He was not asham'd to suffer where the
Cause was honourable and glorious; but so
God provided for the needs of his banished,
and sent a man who could minister comfort
to the afflicted, and courage to the persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and resolutions to the tempted, and
strength to that Religion for which they all
suffered.</p>
            <p>And here this great man was indeed tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant;

The last dayes are the best witnesses of a man.
But so it was, that he stood up in publick and
brave defence for the Doctrine and Discipline
of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> First, by his Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
and great Example, for <hi>Verbis tantÃ¹m phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophari

not a Divine: But this great man did both;
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:100417:27"/>
he suffered his own Calamity with great cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
and by his wise Discourses strengthened
the hearts of others.</p>
            <p>For there wanted not diligent Tempters in
the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> who (taking advantage
of the Afflictions of His Sacred Majesty, in
which state Men commonly suspect every
thing, and like men in sickness are willing to
change from side to side, hoping for ease and
finding none) flew at Royal Game, and hop'd
to draw away the King from that Religion
which His most Royal Father, the best Man
and the wisest Prince in the world, had seal'd
with the best Bloud in Christendom; and
which Himself suck'd in with His Education,
and had confirm'd by Choice and Reason,
and confess'd publickly and bravely, and hath
since restor'd prosperously. <hi>Millitie<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â¢</desc>
                  </gap>e</hi> was
the man, witty and bold enough to attempt
a zelous and a foolish undertaking, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress'd
himself with ignoble indeed but witty
arts to perswade the King to leave what was
dearer to Him then His Eyes. It is true, it
was a Wave dash'd against a Rock, and an
Arrow shot against the Sun, it could not
reach him; but the Bishop of <hi>Derry</hi> turn'd it
also, and made it to fall upon the shooters
head; for he made so ingenious, so learned
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:100417:28"/>
and so accute Reply to that book, he so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd
the Errors of the Roman Church, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted
the Arguments, stated the Questions,
demonstrated the Truth, and sham'd their
Procedures, that nothing could be a greater ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
of the Bishops Learning, great Parts,
deep Judgment, Quickness of Apprehension,
and Sincerity in the Catholick and Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Faith, or of the Follies and Prevarica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> He wrote no
Apologies for himself; though it were much
to be wish'd that, as <hi>Iunius</hi> wrote his own
Life, or <hi>Moses</hi> his own story, so we might
have understood from himself how great
things God had done for him and by him;
but all that he permitted to God, and was
silent in his own Defences; <hi>Gloriosius enim est
injuriam tacendo fugere, quÃ m respondendo superare.</hi>
But when the Honour and Conscience of his
King; and the Interest of a true Religion, was
at stake, the fire burn'd within him, and
at last he spake with his tongue; he cried
out like the son of <hi>Croesus,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
               </gap>,
Take heed and meddle not with the King;
His Person is too sacred, and Religion too
dear to Him to be assaulted by Vulgar hands.
In short, he acquited himself in this affair
with so much Truth and Piety, Learning
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:100417:28"/>
and Judgment, that in those Papers his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
will last unto very late succeeding Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations.</p>
            <p>But this most Reverend Prelate found a
nobler adversary and a braver scene for his
contention. He found that the Roman
Priests being wearied and baffled by the wise
Discourses and pungent Arguments of the
English Divines, had studiously declined any
more to dispute the particular Questions
against us, but fell at last upon a general
Charge, imputing to the Church of <hi>England</hi>
the great crime of Schism; and by this they
thought they might with most probability
deceive unwary and unskilful Readers; for
they saw the Schism, and they saw we had
left them, and because they consider'd not
the Causes, they resolv'd to out-face us in the
Charge. But now it was that <hi>dignum nactus

the Bishop now dedicates his labours to the

the Question, and in a full Discourse proves
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:100417:29"/>
the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> not only to be guilty of
the Schism by making it necessary to depart
from them, but they did actuate the Schisms,
and themselves made the first separation in
the great point of the Popes Supremacy,
which was the <hi>Palladium</hi> for which they prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
contended. He made it appear that
the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> were Usurpers of the rights
of Kings and Bishops, that they brought in
new Doctrines in every Age, that they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
their own devices upon Christendom as
Articles of Faith, that they prevaricated the
Doctrines of the Apostles, that the Church
of <hi>England</hi> only return'd to her Primitive pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
that she joyn'd with Christ and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
that she agreed in all the Sentiments of
the Primitive Church. He stated the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions
so wisely, and conducted them so pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently,
and handled them so learnedly, that I
may truly say, they were never more mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rially

of the sacred Rite of Confirmation, impos'd
hands upon the most Illustrious Princes, the
Dukes of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Gloucester,</hi> and the Princess
Royal, and ministred to them the promise of
the holy Spirit, and ministerially establish'd
them in the Religion and Service of the holy
Jesus. And one thing more I shall remark,
that at his leaving those Parts upon the Kings
Return, some of the Remonstrant Ministers
of the Low-Countries coming to take their
leaves of this great man, and desiring that by
his means the Church of <hi>England</hi> would be
kind to them, he had reason to grant it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they were learned men, and in many
things of a most excellent belief; yet he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd
them, and gave them caution against
it, that they approched too near and gave too
much countenance to the great and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
errors of the Socinians.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:100417:30"/>He thus having serv'd God and the King
abroad, God was pleas'd to return to the King
and to us all, as in the <hi>dayes of old, and we sung
the song of David.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>In convertendo captivitatem Sion:</hi> When King
<hi>David</hi> and all his servants returned to <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi>
this great person having trode in the
Wine-press was called to drink of the Wine,
and as an honorary Reward of his great ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
and abilities was chosen Primate of this
National Church: In which time we are to
look upon him, as the King and the Kings
great Vicegerent did, as a person concerning
whose abilities the World had too great testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
ever to make a doubt. It is true, he
was in the declension of his age and health;
but his very Ruines were goodly; and they
who saw the broken heaps of <hi>Pompey</hi>'s The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atre,
and the crushed Obelisks, and the old
face of beauteous <hi>Philaenium,</hi> could not but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
the disordered glories of such magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
structures, which were venerable in their
very dust.</p>
            <p>He ever was us'd to overcome all difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
onely Mortality was too hard for him;
but still his Vertues and his Spirit was immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,
he still took great care, and still had new
and noble designs, and propos'd to himself
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:100417:31"/>
admirable things. He govern'd his Province
with great justice and sincerity;
<q>
                  <l>Unus amplo consulens pastor gregi,</l>
                  <l>Somnos tuetur omnium solus vigil.</l>
               </q>
And had this remark in all his Government,
that as he was a great hater of Sacrilege, so he
professed himself a publick enemy to Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>residence,
and often would declare wisely
and religiously against it, allowing it in no
case but of Necessity or the greater good of
the Church. There are great things spoken
of his Predecessor S. <hi>Patrick,</hi> that he founded
700. Churches and Religious Convents, that
he ordain'd 5000. Priests, and with his own
hands consecrated 350. Bishops. How true
the story is I know not; but we were all wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
that the late Primate, whose memory
we now celebrate, did by an extraordinary
contingency of Providence in one day conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate
two Archbishops and ten Bishops; and
did benefit to almost all the Churches in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and was greatly instrumental to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endowments
of the whole Clergy; and in
the greatest abilities and incomparable indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry
was inferiour to none of his most glorious
Antecessours.</p>
            <p>Since the Canonization of Saints came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Church, we find no Irish Bishop ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noniz'd,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:100417:31"/>
except S. <hi>Laurence</hi> of <hi>Dublin,</hi> and
S. <hi>Malachias</hi> of <hi>Down;</hi> indeed <hi>Richard</hi> of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magh</hi>'s
Canonization was propounded, but
not effected; but the Character which was
given of that learned Primate by <hi>Trithemius</hi>
does exactly fit this our late Father;<note place="margin">De scriptor. Eccles.</note> 
               <hi>Vir in

                  </expan> Canonici non ignarus, clarus ingenio, sermone

excellentis industriae:</hi> He was learned in the
Scriptures, skill'd in secular Philosophy, and
not unknowing in the Civil and Canon
Laws, (in which studies I wish the Clergy
were with some carefulness and diligence still
more conversant) he was of an excellent spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
a scholar in his discourses, an early and
industrious Preacher to the people. And as
if there were a more particular sympathy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
their souls, our Primate had so great a
Veneration to his memory, that he purpos'd,
if he had liv'd, to have restor'd his Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in <hi>Dundalke,</hi> which Time, or Impiety,
or Unthankfulness had either omitted or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed.
So great a lover he was of all true
and inherent worth, that he lov'd it in the
very memory of the dead, and to have such
great Examples transmitted to the intuition
and imitation of posterity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:100417:32"/>At his coming to the Primacy he knew he
should at first espy little besides the Ruines of
Discipline, a Harvest of Thorns, and Heresies
prevailing in the hearts of the People, the
Churches possess'd by Wolves and Intruders,
Mens hearts greatly estranged from true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;
and therefore he set himself to weed
the fields of the Church; he treated the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries
sometimes sweetly, sometimes he
confuted them learnedly, sometimes he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buk'd
them sharply. He visited his Charges
diligently, and in his own person, not by
Proxies and instrumental Deputations: <hi>Quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rens
non nostra, sednos, &amp; quae sunt Iesu Christi;</hi>
he design'd nothing that we knew of but the
Redintegration of Religion, the Honour of
God and the King, the Restoring of collap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Discipline, and the Renovation of Faith
and the Service of God in the Churches. And
still he was indefatigable, and, even as the
last scene of his life, intended to undertake a
a Regal Visitation. <hi>Quid enim vultis me otio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum
Ã  Domino comprehendi?</hi> said one; he was
not willing that God should take him unim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed:
But, good man, he felt his Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle
ready to fall in pieces, and could go no
further, for God would have no more work
done by that hand; he therefore espying this,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:100417:32"/>
put his house in order, and had lately visited
his Diocese, and done what he then could to
put his Charge in order; for he had a good
while since receiv'd the sentence of death
within himself, and knew he was shortly to
render an account of his stewardship; he
therefore upon a brisk alarm of death, which
God sent him the last <hi>Ianuary,</hi> made his Will;
in which, besides the prudence and presence
of spirit manifested in making just and wise
settlement of his Estate, and provisions for his
Descendants; at midnight, and in the trouble
of his sickness and circumstances of addres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
death, still kept a special sentiment and
made confession of Gods admirable mercies,
and gave thanks that God had permitted him
to live to see the blessed Restauration of His
Majesty and the Church of <hi>England,</hi> confess'd
his Faith to be the same as ever, gave praises
to God that he was born and bred up in this
Religion, and prayed to God and hop'd he
should die in the Communion of this
Church, which he declar'd to be the most
pure and Apostolical Church in the whole
world.</p>
            <p>He prayed to God to pardon his frailties
and infirmities, relied upon the mercies of
God and the merits of Jesus Christ, and with
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:100417:33"/>
a singular sweetness resign'd up his soul into
the hands of his Redeemer.</p>
            <p>But God, who is the great <hi>Choragus</hi> and
Master of the Scenes of Life and Death, was
not pleas'd then to draw the Curtains; there
was an Epilogue to his Life yet to be acted
and spoken. He return'd to actions and life,
and went on in the methods of the same pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedure
as before; was desirous still to esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish
the affairs of the Church, complain'd of
some disorders which he purpos'd to redress,
girt himself to the work; but though his spirit
was willing, yet his flesh was weak; and as
the Apostles in the Vespers of Christs Passion,
so he in the Eve of his own Dissolution was
heavy, not to sleep, but heavy unto death, and
look'd for the last warning, which seiz'd on
him in the midst of business; and though it
was sudden, yet it could not be unexpected,
or unprovided by surprize, and therefore could
be no other then that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
               </gap> which <hi>Augustus</hi>
us'd to wish unto himself, a civil and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natur'd
death, without the amazement of
troublesom circumstances, or the great cracks
of a falling house, or the convulsions of impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience.
<hi>Seneca</hi> tells that <hi>Bassus Aufidius</hi> was
wont to say,<note place="margin">Epist. 30.</note>

               </gap>olution were little or none; or
if they were it was full of comfort that they
could be but short. It happened so to this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Man; his Passive Fortitude had been
abundantly tried before, and therefore there
was the less need of it now; his active Graces
had been abundantly demonstrated by the
great and good things he did, &amp; therefore his
last scene was not so laborious, but God call'd
him away something after the manner of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi>
which the Jews express by <hi>Osculum oris Dei,</hi>
The Kiss of Gods mouth; that is, a death in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
foresignified, but gentle, and serene, and
without temptation.</p>
            <p>To summe up all; He was a wise Prelate,
a learned Doctor, a just Man, a true Friend, a
great Benefactour to others, a thankful Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiary
where he was oblig'd himself. He was
a faithful Servant to his Masters, a Loyal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jest
to the King, a zelous Assertor of his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
against Popery on one side, and Fanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cism
on the other. The practice of his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
was not so much in Forms and exteriour
Ministries, though he was a great observer of
all the publick Rites and Ministries of the
Church, as it was in doing good for others. He
was like <hi>Myson,</hi> whom the <hi>Scythian Anarchasis</hi>

to mankind; he had the fate of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
S. <hi>Paul,</hi> he pass'd through evil report and
good report, as a deceiver and yet true. He
was a man of great business and great resort:
<hi>Semper aliquis in Cydonis domo,</hi> as the Corinthian
said; There was alwayes somebody in <hi>Cydon</hi>'s

his life into labour and his book; he took
care of his Churches when he was alive, and
even after his death, having left 500 <hi>l.</hi> for the
Repair of his Cathedral of <hi>Armagh</hi> and S. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
Church in <hi>Drogheda.</hi> He was an excellent
Scholar, and rarely well accomplish'd; first
instructed to great excellency by natural parts,
and then consummated by study and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
<hi>Melanchthon</hi> was us'd to say that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
was a Logician, <hi>Pomeranus</hi> a Gramma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian,
<hi>Iustus Ionas</hi> an Orator, but that <hi>Luther</hi>
was all these. It was greatly true of him,
that the single perfections which make many
men eminent, were united in this Primate
and made him illustrious.

him was visible the great lines of <hi>Hooker</hi>'s Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciousness,
of <hi>Iewel</hi>'s Learning, of the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuteness
of Bishop <hi>Andrews.</hi> He was skill'd
in more great things then one; and, as one
said of <hi>Phidias,</hi> he could not onely make ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
statues of Ivory, but he could work in
Stone and Brass. He shewed his Equani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
in Poverty, and his Justice in Riches;
he was useful in his Countrey, and profitable
in his Banishment; for, as <hi>Paraeus</hi> was at <hi>Anvilla,

the Souldiers out of his store in <hi>York-shire,</hi>
when himself could but ill spare it; but he
receiv'd publick thanks from the Convocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

<pb n="66" facs="tcp:100417:35"/>
Justification from the Parliament where he
was Speaker; so that although, as one said,

that we may all meet together with him at

I conclude with the words of <hi>Caius Plinius,
