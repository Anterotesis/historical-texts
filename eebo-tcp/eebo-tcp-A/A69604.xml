            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

By Sir Nicholas Bacon, Lord

&amp;c.</head>
            <p>THis Argument was occasioned about
an <hi>Attachment,</hi> awarded out of the
aforesaid Court of <hi>Chancery</hi> to the
Sheriffe of <hi>Norfolke,</hi> to attach the body of the
then Lord <hi>Cromwell</hi> for his disobeying a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
made in that Court, The said <hi>Attache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
being executed, and the body of the said
Lord <hi>Cromwell</hi> by vertue thereof detained by
the said Sheriffe, whereof the said Lord <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi>
being a Peere, complained in <hi>Parliament.</hi>

               <head>I.</head>
               <p>First (saith he) That for Contempts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
by a Noble man against his Prince, his
person is attachable by Law. And if a Noble
man disobey a Decree, made in <hi>Chancery</hi> upon
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:57491:3"/>
a cause examinable, there he commits a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
against his Prince, and therefore, by the
common Law, his body, for his contempt, is
attachable, and the rather for that decrees gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
there are <hi>Coram nobis in Cancellaria no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stra.</hi>

               <p>Secondly, if a Noble Man offend against the
Queenes Majesties <hi>Prerogative</hi> in one of the
highest degrees, his body is attachable by Law:
and if a Noble man commit a contempt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
a decree made in the high court of chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerie
&amp; warranted to be made by her highnesse
<hi>Prerogative,</hi> he commits a contempt against
that <hi>Prerogative</hi> &amp; therefore his body for the
same is attachable by Law.</p>

               <head>III.</head>
               <p>Thirdly, it hath alwayes been accustomed
that Noble men have beene and still are called
into the Chancerie for matters examinable in
the same Court; and the same hath beene or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
there, and if custome hath allowed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
then it must necessarily allow the necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
dependance of the same, which is the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of these orders: and other meanes for the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57491:3"/>
ecution of these orders in Chancerie there
is none but by Attachment, and as for that, that
there is no use or President of execution by
Attachment of the persons of Noble men, he
answered that in former ages Noble men were
of that prudence, that they never disobeyed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of those orders in Chancerie, and therefore
no cause of that use.</p>

            <div n="4" type="part">
               <head>IIII.</head>
               <p>Fourthly, to grant a Court power to heare
and order, and not to execute the same, is a
plaine absurdity: &amp; againe to leave all coppi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houlders
of Noble men without remedie, if
they be amoved by their Lords, and all other
men without remedie against Noble men, in
matter of equity, seemes much prejudiciall to
the Commonwealth, considering how great the
number of these may be; besides what incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience
is it to have a Noble man bring a case
into the Chancery, &amp; the Court to have power
to doe justice for him, but not against him.
This is not <hi>Ius equabile,</hi> and all th,ese and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
inconveniences, in his opinion will suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
except Attachments in the causes of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
before remembred be allowed and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted.</p>

               <head>V</head>
               <p>Fiftly, and lastly, for asmuch as the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerie
is warranted to heare, order, and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
causes by vertue of the Queenes Majes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<hi>Prerogative;</hi> where otherwise by law the
subject hath no helpe: and also to qualifie
the rigour of the Law, therefore if all causes
examinable in the Court of Chancerie for the
respects aforesaid, betweene a Noble man and
another should be taken from the hearing
and ordering of the said Court. It must needs
be Derogation of the Queenes said <hi>Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi>
which he thinkes ought not to be que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioned
or debated without her Majesties Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitie,
and therefore prayes her Highnesse may
be therewith acquainted.</p>
