            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He powerfull God of Armies, who onely giues true ſtrength vnto the arme, and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage vnto the heart, to fight the battels of his holy name and truth, euen in the midſt of hopeleſſe perils, hath in all ages ſtood for the miraculous deliuerance of his afflicted Church, when pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſterous and maleuolent minds vrged the finall ruine and extirpation thereof. This cannot in any thing more eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appeare, then in the bloudie and fearefull agitations of the French Church, vnder the troubleſome reignes of Henry the third and Henry the fourth, of indelible me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie: when priuate maſſacres and open hoſtilitie had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt extinguiſhed the chiefe Nobilitie and gentrie of France, and yet in the very inſtant of diſpaire, God with his mightie finger toucht the Kings heart the third Henry, and opened the eyes of his royall vnderſtanding, which produced this happie Edict of Nants now here publiſhed, for a faire pacification of all former troubles and combu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions. Yet was not this fire ſo cleare extinguiſhed (omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the deuaſtations of armes, during the reigne of the laſt renowned Henrie) but that the oppoſite ſpirits of theſe times found out ſome vnquenched ſparkes, whereof to kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle a new flame of cruell warre and bloudſhed, euen in the young and ambitious yeares of this preſent Lewis the thirteenth, the which notwithſtanding after ſome ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble feeling of his heauie hand and diſpleaſure, it hath plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

As proceeding from one and the ſelfe ſame cauſe, theſe instant French troubles haue bene accorded with one and the like effect, the Articles of this preſent Peace being drawne and extracted from the modell and frame of the former Edict of Nants in this Treatiſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uulged, which being at leaſt more large and copious, by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent comparing the one with the other, the beſt vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings may more abſolutely iudge, both of the forme and ſubſtance of the preſent conditions.

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Enrie by the grace of God, King of France and of Nauarre, To all thoſe preſent or hereafter to come, greeting. Amongſt thoſe infinite graces which it hath pleaſed God to impart vnto vs, this is one moſt notable and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marquable, that he hath giuen vs the conſtancie and power, not to be ſhaken with thoſe terrible confuſions, troubles, and diſorders, which were on foote at our comming to this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, the ſame being diuided into ſo many partiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and factions, that the ſame moſt lawfull, was as it were the leaſt in power: and yet neuertheleſſe we bore vp ſo ſtifly in the midſt of all this ſtorme, as in the end we ouercame it, and are now entred into the harbour of ſafetie &amp; repoſe within this State. The abſolute and whole glorie whereof were downd onely to him, and the grace and bounden dutie therefore to vs, in that he was pleaſed to make vſe of our labour and trauaile, for the performance of this ſo good a worke: wherein it hath bene apparent to the whole world, whether we
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:4148:4"/>
haue not diſcharged therein, not onely our dutie and power, but further ſomething more alſo, then in ſome other ſeaſon had bene correſpondent to the digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie we hold; the which we haue not bene afraid to hazard and expoſe, ſeeing we haue ſo mauy times ſo freely aduentured, and endangered our owne life. And in this great concurrence of ſo weightie and perillous affaires, not being able to compound them all at one time, we were tyed to obſerue therein this order: firſt to vndertake thoſe differences which could not be determined otherwiſe then by force; and rather to defer, and hold in ſuſpence the other for a certaine time, which were or might be diſcuſſed by equitie and iuſtice: ſuch as were the generall differences betweene our good ſubiects, and the particular aggrieuances of the more ſound parts of our State, which we ſuppoſed might more eaſily be cured by remouing the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall cauſe thereof, which was the continuance of the ciuill warre. Wherein (by Gods ſpeciall grace) ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing had good and happy ſucceſſe; and hoſtilitie and armes being layd apart in all the interiour parts of the kingdome, we hope it will ſucceed no worſe alſo in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther affaires which yet remaine to be compounded: and that by this meanes we ſhall obtaine the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a good peace, and quiet repoſe, which was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the butt and ayme of all our vowes and intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the onely prize and reward we looke for after ſuch wonderfull trauaile and paines wherein we haue paſſed the courſe of our life. Among the ſaid af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires which required our patience, and one of the moſt principall, was the complaints we daily receiued from many of our Catholicke Prouinces &amp; Townes,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:4148:4"/>
in that the exerciſe of the Catholicke Religion was not generally reeſtabliſhed, as the Edicts heretofore made for the Pacification of troubles through the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of Religion imported. As alſo the Supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Remonſtrances exhibited vnto vs by our ſubiects of the pretended reformed Religion, both for the execution of that accorded vnto them by the ſaid Edicts, as further for that they deſired there might be added for the practiſe of their ſaid Religion, the the libertie of their conſciences, and the ſecurity of their perſons and goods: preſuming they had iuſt oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of new and more fearefull apprehenſions, by reaſon of theſe laſt commotions and inſults, the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall pretext and foundation whereof was for their ruine. Wherefore not to ouercharge our ſelues with too many buſineſſes at one inſtant, and likewiſe that the furie of Armes might not interrupt the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of lawes, how good or behoouefull ſoeuer, we deferred from time to time the prouiſion and care hereof. But now ſince it hath pleaſed God to giue a beginning for our enioyance of ſome better repoſe and quiet, we eſteeme that we cannot better employ it, then in proſecuting and intending that which concerneth the ſeruice and glorie of his holy Name, procuring that it may be adored and prayed vnto by all our ſubiects: and though it yet ſtand not with his pleaſure, that this ſhould be vnder one and the ſame forme of Religion, notwithſtanding that it might be at leaſt with one intention and meaning, and with ſuch gouernment that no vprores or tumults might accrew betweene them: and that our ſelues and this kingdome might alwayes deſerue and preſerue the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:4148:5"/>
glorious title of Moſt Chriſtian, which was purchaſed ſo long time ſince, and with ſo many worthy demerits: and ſo by the ſame meanes to ſupplant the cauſe of all moleſtations and troubles which might enſue hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vpon the point of Religion, which hath euer bene the moſt preualent and penetrant of all others. For the ſame occaſion, obſeruing this affaire to be of ſuch high conſequence, and worthie of deepe and waightie conſideration, after a reuoluing of all Regiſters of the complaints of our Catholicke ſubiects, and hauing alſo permitted our ſaid ſubiects of the ſaid pretended reformed Religion, to aſſemble by deputies for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting of their aggrieuances, and for reducing toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all their ſaid Remonſtrances: and hauing confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with them diuers times vpon this point, &amp; reuiew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the precedent Edicts; We haue thought is conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to enact at this time generally for all our ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects a Law vniuerſall, cleare, plaine, and abſolute, by which they ſhall be limited &amp; gouerned in all differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that haue heretofore growne betweene them in theſe points, or that may hereafter happen, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in both the one and the other may remaine ſatisfied, according as the quality of the preſent times doth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit: Our ſelues being entred into this deliberation, for no other end but out of the zeale we beare to the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of God, and that from this time forward there may be ratified and confirmed betweene our ſaid ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects a firme and perpetuall Peace. Wherein we both inuoke and attend from his diuine Maieſtie, the ſame protection and fauour which he hath euer moſt eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently conferred vpon this Kingdome from the ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction thereof, and during the many ages it hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued:
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:4148:5"/>
and that he will beſtow the grace vpon our ſaid ſubiects, truly to apprehend, that in the obſeruation of this our ordinance and Decree, (next to their imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate duties towards God and Our ſelues) conſiſteth the maine foundation of their vnion and concord, tranquillitie, and repoſe, and the reſtauration of this whole Eſtate to her originall ſplendor, opulencie, and power.
