         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A
CHARACTER
Of Monsieur Scarron's Works,</head>
            <head type="sub">In a Letter from the Famous Monsieur de Balzac to Monsieur Castor.</head>
            <p>THE Book you sent me from Monsieur <hi>Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi>
was a very acceptable Present, and such
a one as I am obliged to set a great value up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
so long as I live. I had scarce open'd it,
but it perform'd a Cure upon me, and gave me ease in
a cruel fit of the Spleen, which had certainly done my
business, had not this Cordial come so seasonably to my
Relief. I hope it will work greater cures, if I often ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
it. Perhaps it will rid me of my pensive Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and Philosophical Sadness: Perhaps it will teach me
to Rhyme, and make me chearful by Contagion. To
deal plainly with you, this Friend of ours Monsieur
<hi>Scarron,</hi> is a strange sort of a Gentleman. With all his
Distempers he has something in him tho' I know not how
to describe it, better than Health, I mean, a stupid,
insensible Health; for I need not tell you that the <hi>Arabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
call Joy the Quintessence and Elixir of a lively,
active Health. Now since you are desirous to know my
different thoughts upon our Author, and require me to
say something particular upon this Head; I must tell
you that he is either the most dissembling, or the most
resolute Man in the Universe. I farther add, that he is
a living Testimony that Mankind is not so effeminate,
as 'tis commonly believed, unless pain uses him more
gently than it does other Men. One that has convers'd
with his Writings, and sees him so merry in his Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
<pb facs="tcp:53808:3"/>
would think that the Executioner flatter'd the suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferer.
I never see him laugh in the midst of his Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
but he makes me think that his pain does not
give him any smart, but only titillation. In short, I
will Affirm, that the <hi>Prom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>theus,</hi> the <hi>Hercules,</hi> and
<hi>Philoctetes</hi> in our Fables, to say nothing of <hi>Iob</hi> in his
real History, speak abundance of great and manly things
in the height of their pains, but nothing that is gay and
cheerful. Among the Ancients, I have frequently met
with those griefs that have been sedate and calm, that
have appear'd to be wise and eloquent, but I never found
a Grief that was cheerful till now; or a Soul that was
able to dance a Saraband or a Jigg in a paralytical Body.
So pleasant a Prodigy as this, deserves the consideration
of our curious Virtuosos. History ought not to forget it<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
and if ever the whim takes me to set up for an Historian,
as I am already an Historiographer, I shall reckon it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the greatest Miracles of our time, which has been
so fruitful in Miracles. What wou'd not your Friend
<hi>Seneca</hi> have said upon so noble a Subject, he that took so
much pleasure to treat of these matters, and so often
sought opportunities to do it? Is it not a plain case, that
that arrogant and haughty Virtue, which is so extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly
commended by him, and pretends to be at ease
even in <hi>Phalaris</hi>'s Bull, nay, maintains, that Pain it self
is a Blessing, falls infinitely short of this easie and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Virtue, which can put in execution the Paradoxes of
the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> without the least touch of their Ostentation<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
Let us therefore conclude in honour of our Author, that
either there is something of extasy and possession in his
Distemper, and that his Soul performs it's functions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part,
without concerning it self with his Body, or that
he is a Man of extraordinary Resolution and Vigour, and
that in the perpetual Dispute between his Soul and his
Body, the Nobler part finds those Advantages over the
other, which the strongest use to have over the weakest.</p>

            <head>To the Courteous Reader that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
saw me.</head>
            <p>UNknown Friend, who never saw'st me in
thy Life, and perhaps never troubledst
thy self much about it, because there is
no great matter to be got by the sight of such a
fellow as I am; be it known unto thee that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
am I very desirous thou shouldst see my
Person, but that I have been inform'd that some
facetious Gentlemen make themselves merry at the
expence of an unhappy Wretch, and describe me
another sort of a Monster, than really I am. Some
of them give out, that my Rump-bone sticks out
like the Ace of Spades, by the same token that
it perforates all my Breeches, and that I am set
upon a Table in a Cage, where I chatter like a
blind Magpy. And others will tell you, and swear
to it too if you'd have them, that my Hat is
fasten'd to a Cord that runs through a Pully, and that
I pluck it up or let it down, when I am to compliment
and Friend, that does me the honour of a Visit.</p>
            <p>I therefore thought my self obliged in Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and all that, to prevent their telling so many
<pb facs="tcp:53808:4"/>
horrid Lyes, and for this reason order'd my
Picture to be engraved, as thou seest it, in the
beginning of this Book. I know thou wilt grum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
Courteous Reader, for every Reader in the
World is a Grumbletonian more or less; and for
my part, I can grum<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>le as well as the best of
them, when 'tis my turn to be a Reader. Thou
wilt grumble in thy gizzard, I say, and snarl, and
quarrel, and huff, and puff, because forsooth, I
show thee my Back-side. But prithee, Old Friend,
don't be too Choleric. Assure thy self that I did
not do it with a design to turn my Breech upon
the Company; but only because the Convexity of
my Back is more proper to receive an Inscripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
than the Concavity of my Stomach, which is
wholly covered by the Pent-house of my Head,
that hangs over it, and because the Situation, or
rather the irregular Plan of my Person may be
seen as well behind as before. I am not such a
Coxcomb as to pretend to make a Present to the
Public (for by those Iolly Damosels the Nine
Muses, I swear and protest that I never dreamt
in my life of seeing my Head stamped in a Medal)
but I would have had my Picture drawn, if I cou'd
have found a Painter bold enough to take my Phyz
in black and white. For want of a Picture therefore
I'le describe my self to thee as near as I can.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:53808:4"/>I am past thirty, as thou mayst see by the back of
my Chair. If I live to be forty, I shall add the Lord
knows how many Misfortunes to those I have already
suffer'd for these eight or nine years last past. There
was a time when my Stature was not to be found fault
with, tho' now tis of the smallest. My Sickness has
taken me shorter by a foot: My Head is somewhat
too bigg considering my height, and my Face is full
enough in all conscience for one that carries such a
Skeleton of a body about him. I have hair enough on
my Head not to stand in need of a Periwig, and 'tis
gray too, in spite of the Proverb. My Sight is good
enough, tho' my Eyes are large; they are of a blew
colour, and one of them is sunk deeper into my head
than the other, which was occasion'd by my leaning on
that side. My Nose is well enough mounted. My Teeth,
that in the days of yore looked like a row of square
Pearl, are now of an ashen colour, and in a few years
more, will have the complexion of a smallcoal Man's
Saturday shirt. I have lost one Tooth and a half on
the left side, and two and a half precisely on the right,
and I have two more that stand somewhat out of their
Ranks. My Legs and my Thighs in the first place
compose an obtuse Angle, then an equal Angle, and
lastly an acute Angle. My Thighs and my Body make
another, and my head leaning perpetually over my Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
I fancy I am not very unlike the letter Z. My
<pb facs="tcp:53808:5"/>
Arms are shortned as well as my Legs, and my Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
as well as my Arms. In short, I am a living Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome
of humane Misery. This, as near as I can give
it, is my shape. Since I am got so far, I will e'en
tell thee something of my Humour. Vnder the Rose
be it spoken, Courteous Reader, I do this only to swell
the bulk of my Book, at the Request of the Booksel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,
the poor Dog it seems being afraid that he should
be a loser by this Impression, if he did not give the
Courteous Reader enough for his Money. Were it not
for this, 'twou'd be to no purpose this Digression as
well as a thousand more. But to our comfort be it said,
ours is not the first Age that People play'd the fools
out of Complaisance, not to reckon the follies they
commit of their own heads.</p>
            <p>I was always a little Cholerick, a little given to my
Guts, and a little Lazy. I frequently call my Man
Son of a Whore and Fool, and a little after call him
Sir. I hate no Man, and could wish all the World did
the same by me. I am as blithe as a bird when I have
Mony, and should be much more so, were I in health.
I am merry enough in Company. I am content enough
when alone. I bear all my ills pretty patiently. And
now as I humbly conceive, the Porch is big enough
for the House, and 'tis high time for me to conclude.</p>

that look'd as they had been taken from the Enemy by way of
Plunder. Instead of a Hat he wore a Night-Cap, tied about
his Head with Garters of several Colours; and this Head-dress
was without doubt a kind of unfinish'd Turbant. His
Doublet was a Griset-Coat, girt over with a Leather Thong;
which serv'd likewise to support a Rapier so very long, that it
could not be us'd dextrously without the help of a Rest. He
wore a pair of Breeches tuck'd up to above the middle of his
Thighs, like those that Players wear when they represent an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Hero; and instead of Shoes he wore Tragick Buskins,
which were bespatter'd with Dirt up to the Ancles. An old
Man, something more regular in his Dress, tho' in very or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Cloaths, walk'd by his side. He carried a Base-viol over
his Shoulders; and because he stoop'd a little as he went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long,
one might have taken him at a distance for a great Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toise
walking upon his hind-Feet. Some Critick or other will
perhaps find fault with the Comparison, by reason of the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportion
between a Tortoise and a Man: But I speak of
those great Tortoises that are found in the <hi>Indies;</hi> and
besides, I make bold to use the Simile upon my own Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.
Let's return to our strolling Company. They went
by the Tennis-Court at the <hi>Hind;</hi> before which were assembled
several of the Chief Men of the Town. The Novelty of their
Equipage, and the Noise of the Mob, who by this time had
gathered about the Cart, drew the Eyes of all those Honourable
Burgh-Masters upon our unknown Travellers,
Among the rest, a<note n="*" place="margin">An Vnder-Sheriff.</note> Lieutenant of the Provost,
<hi>La Rappiniere</hi> by Name, made up to them,
and with the Authority of a Magistrate, ask'd them, who they
were? The young Man, whom I describ'd before, without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
to pull off his Turbant (because with one of his Hands
he held his Gun, and with the other the Hilt of his Sword, lest
it should beat against his Legs) answer'd him, That they were

                     </gap> That his Stage-Name
was <hi>Destiny;</hi> his old Comrades <hi>Rancour;</hi> and the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewomen
(who sat roosting like a Hen on the top of their Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage)
<hi>Cave.</hi> This odd Name set some of the Company a laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
whereupon the young Stroller added, That the Name of
<hi>Cave</hi> ought not to seem more strange to Men of Wit than those of
<hi>La Montagne, Valley, Rose,</hi> or <hi>Thorn.</hi> The Conversation ended
with the noise of Blows; and Cursing, and Swearing, which was
heard before the Cart. This Squabble was occasion'd by the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
of the Tennis-Court falling foul upon the Carter, without say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:53808:7"/>
why, or wherefore, because his Oxen and his Mare were a
little too free with a heap of Hay which stood before the Door.
However the Fray was parted; and the Mistress of the Tennis-Court,
who lov'd to hear a Play more than to hear a Sermon
or Vespers, out of unheard of Generosity in a Keeper of a Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis-Court,
bid the Carter let his Cattel eat their Belly-full.
He took her at her Word: and whilst the hungry Beasts were
feeding, the Author rested a while, and bethought himself what
he should say in the second Chapter.</p>

                  <head type="sub">What sort of Man la Rappiniere was.</head>
                  <p>THE <hi>Sieur la Rappiniere</hi> was at that time the Droll or Jester
of <hi>Mans;</hi> for you must know, that there is not a Town,
though never so small, but has its Jester. The City of <hi>Paris</hi>
has several in each Ward; and I my self might have been
the Jester of mine, had I been willing to it: But every Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
knows, that 'tis a long time since I have forsaken all the
Vanities of this World. To return to <hi>Monsieur la Rappiniere;</hi>
he soon renew'd the Conversation which the Squabble had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted,
and ask'd the young Player, Whether their Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
consisted only in Mistress <hi>Cave, Monsieur Rancour,</hi> and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self?
Our Company, answer'd he, is as compleat as that of
the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> or of his Grace the Duke <hi>d'Epernon;</hi> but
through a Misfortune that befel us at <hi>Tours,</hi> where our Rattle-headed
Door-keeper kill'd one of the Fuziliers of the Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
of the Province, we were forc'd to fly in a hurry, and
in the sad Pickle you see us in. Those Fuziliers of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants,
said <hi>la Rappiniere,</hi> have done as much at <hi>la Flesche;</hi>
A Pox take them, said the Mistress of the Tennis-Court, 'tis
long of them we shall have no Plays. Nay, answer'd the
old Stroller, had we but the Keys of our Trunks, we might
entertain the Town for four or five Days before we reach
<hi>Alençon,</hi> where the rest of our Company are to rendezvous.
The Player's Answer made every Body prick up their Ears:
<hi>La Rappiniere</hi> offer'd an old Gown of his Wife's to <hi>Cave;</hi> and
the Tennis-Woman two or three Suits of Clothes, which
were left in pawn, to <hi>Destiny</hi> and <hi>Rancour.</hi> But, added some
of the Assistants, there is but three of you. No matter for that,
reply'd <hi>Rancour,</hi> for I once acted a Play by my self, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:53808:8"/>
the King, the Queen, and the Ambassador. I us'd
a false Treble Tone when I personated the Queen; I spoke
through the Nose for the Ambassador, and address'd my self to
the Crown which I plac'd upon a Chair; and as for the King, I
resum'd my Seat, my Crown, and my Gravity, and lower'd
the Key of my Voice into a Base. Now, to convince you, if
you will satisfie our Carter, defray our Charges in the Inn,
and lend us what Clothes you can spare, we will act before
Night; else we must beg leave to go to drink, or rest our selves,
for we are come a great way. The Company lik'd the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal,
and that Devil <hi>la Rappiniere,</hi> who was ever hatching some
Mischief or other, said, there was no occasion for any other
Clothes but those of two young Men of the Town, who were
then playing a Set at Tennis, and that Mistress <hi>Cave</hi> in her ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Dress, might pass for any Thing in a Play. No sooner
said but done; in less than half a quarter of an Hour the
Strollers drank three or four Glasses of Wine apiece, shifted
themselves; and the Company, who by this time had encreas'd
into a full Audience, having taken their Places in an upper Room,
a dirty Cloath, instead of a painted Curtain, was drawn up, and
discover'd <hi>Destiny</hi> lying on a Quilt, with a Strawberry Basket
on his Head, instead of a Crown, rubbing his Eyes, like one
who wakes out of his Sleep, and mouthing in the Tone of
<hi>Mondory,</hi> the Part of <hi>Herod,</hi> which begins thus:
<q>Injurious Phantom, that disturbs my Rest.</q>
The Patch which cover'd one half of his Face, did not hinder

<hi>Cave</hi> acted to admiration the Parts of <hi>Mariana,</hi> and <hi>Salome;
Rancour</hi> pleas'd every Body in his; and the Play was carrying on
to a happy Conclusion, when the Devil, who never sleeps, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpos'd,
and made the Tragedy end, not with the Death of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riana,</hi>
and <hi>Herod</hi>'s Despair, but with a Thousand Cuffs, and
Boxes on the Ears, as many Kicks, numberless Oaths; and

                  <head type="sub">What deplorable Success the Play had.</head>
                  <p>IN all the Inferiour Towns of the Kingdom, there's generally
a Tennis-Court, where all the idle People use to resort, some
to play, others only to look on. 'Tis in those Places where
Cursing and Swearing passes for a Rhetorical Flourish, and
where the Absent are murder'd with the Tongue; no Man
'scapes Scot-free; there all live in open Defiance, and every Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
is admitted to rail, according to the Talent he has receiv'd
from the Lord. 'Twas in one of these Tennis-Courts, if my
Memory fails me not, that I left three Comical Persons, reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<hi>Mariana</hi> before an Honourable Company; at which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sided
<hi>Monsieur la Rappiniere.</hi> Now while <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Mariana</hi>
were telling one another of their Faults, the two young
Men, whose Clothes they had so freely borrowed, came into
the Room in their Drawers, and each of 'em his Racket in his
Hand, having neglected to get themselves rubb'd, that they
might come and hear the Play. They were not long in the
Room before they perceiv'd that <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pherores</hi> had their
Clothes on; and the most passionate of the two addressing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to the Waiter of the Tennis-Court; Thou Son of a Bitch, said
he to him, Why didst thou give my Clothes to that Mountebank?
The innocent Waiter, who knew him to be a bruitish sort of a
Man, told him in great Humility, That he had no Hand in
it. Who then, Scoundrel? added he. The poor Fellow durst
not accuse <hi>la Rappiniere</hi> in his Presence; but he, the most inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
of all Men, rising from his Seat, told him, 'Tis I; What
have you to say to it? That you are a Coxcomb, reply'd
the other; and at the same time gave him a desperate
Blow over the Pate with his Racket. <hi>La Rappiniere</hi> was so
surpriz'd to be struck first, whereas he us'd to be beforehand with
others, that he stood motionless, either out of Admiration, or
because he was not yet angry enough, and that 'twas not a
small Provocation that could make him resolve to fight, were
it but at Fifty-cuffs. Nay, perhaps the Quarrel had gone no
further, had not his Man, who was more Cholerick than he,
fallen foul upon the Aggressor, and dealt him a sound Cuff on the
Chops, and in the middle of his Face, and afterwards a great
many others where he cou'd find room for them. <hi>La Rappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niere</hi>
                     <pb n="6" facs="tcp:53808:9"/>
charg'd him behind, and work't on him like one that had
receiv'd the first Provocation: A Relation of his Adversary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vested
<hi>la Rappinere</hi> in the same manner. This Relation was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack'd
by one of <hi>la Rappinierr</hi>'s Friends, in order to make a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version:
This Combatant was assaulted by another, and this
last again by another. In short, the whole Audience divided
into Parties; some curst and swore; others call'd Names;
all beat one another. The Tennis-Woman who saw her Goods
broken to pieces, rent the Air with doleful Cries. In all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability
they had all been murder'd with Stools, Kicks, and
Cuffs, had not some of the Magistrates of the Town (who
walk'd in the Piazza of the Market-place, with <hi>des Essars,</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neschal
of <hi>Mayne</hi>) ran with all speed to the Squabble. Some
propos'd to throw two or three Pails full of Water on the
Combatants; and perhaps this way might have been success<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful;
but however they gave over fighting through weariness:
Besides two Capuchins, who out of Charity flung themselves into
the Field of Battle, procur'd, not a firm Peace, betwixt the
contending Parties, but a sort of Truce; during which a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiation
was set on foot, without derogating from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations
that were taken on both sides, in order to a Tryal in
due Course of Law. <hi>Destiny,</hi> one of the Strolliers, perform'd
Wonders at Boxing; and his great Actions are talk'd of to this
very Day in the Town of <hi>Mans,</hi> according to the faithful Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
deliver'd by the two young Men that rais'd the Squabble,
whom he particularly engag'd, and almost cuff'd to death; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
a great many others of the Enemy, whom he disabled with
the first Blow. He lost his Patch in the Scuffie, and People
took notice that his Face was as fine as his Shape. The bloody
Noses were handsomly wash'd with clean water: those that had
their Bands torn, put on others instead of them; Cataplasms
were applyed where need requir'd; some few Stitches serv'd to
darn many a torn Doublet; and the Houshold-Goods were set
in their proper places, tho not so sound and whole as they were
before. In short, a moment after there remain'd nothing of the
Right but a great Spite and Animosity, which appear'd in the
Faces of those of both Parties. The poor Strollers went out a
long while after the Combat with <hi>la Rappiniere,</hi> who was still
for making Speeches. In their way from the Tennis-Court to
the Market-place they were invested by seven or eight Bullies
with Swords in their hands; <hi>la Rappiniere,</hi> according to custom,
was in a great fright, and indeed not without a cause, had not
<hi>Destiny</hi> generously thrust himself between him and a Sword
which was going to run him through; however he could not
so well put by the Blow, but that he receiv'd a small wound in
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:53808:9"/>
the Arm. Thereupon he drew his Sword, and in the twinkling
of an Eye, beat two Swords out of the hands of the Enemy,
broke two or three Sculls, batter'd and slash'd as many Faces
and discomfited so well the Gentlemen of the Ambuscade, that
all the Assistants unanimously confest, they never had seen so va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant
a Champion. This abortive Plot was laid against <hi>La Rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piniere,</hi>
by two Squires, one of which was married to the Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of him, who begun the Fight with a great blow with a
Racket, and in all likelyhood, <hi>La Rappiniere</hi> had been spoil'd
for ever, but for the valiant Protector, whom Providence rais'd
for him in the Person of our stout Player. This Benefit melted
his Heart of Flint, insomuch, that he would not suffer the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable
remains of a scatter'd Company of Strollers<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> to lodge
in an Inn; but brought them to his own House, where the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
laid down the Strolling Furniture, and return'd home to his
Village.</p>

like a sober well-bred Man; <hi>Cave</hi> like a famish'd Player; and
Madam <hi>La Rappiniere</hi> like one who had a mind to lay hold of
the Opportunity; that is to say, so very greedily, that she got
a Surfeit. Whilst the Servants were at Supper, and the Beds
making, <hi>La Rappiniere</hi> teaz'd his Guests with a thousand Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
full of Vanity. <hi>Destiny</hi> lay in a little Room by himself;
<hi>Cave</hi> in a Closet with the Chamber-Maid; and <hi>Rancour</hi> with the
Valet, I know not where. They all had a great mind to Sleep,
some through weariness, others for having supp'd too plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
and yet they slept but little; so true it is, that there is
nothing certain in this World. After her first Sleep, Madam <hi>la
Rapiniere</hi> had a mind to go where Kings are fain to go them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in Person; her Husband wak'd at the same time, and
tho' he had not recover'd his Drunkenness, he found himself a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone;
he call'd his Wife, no body answer'd: Whereupon he
grew Jealous, fell in a Passion, and instantly rose out of his
Bed in a Fury. As soon as he was got out of the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
he heard a stamping of feet before him, and for some time
followed the noise through a little Gallery, that led to <hi>Destiny</hi>'s
Chamber. He found himself so near what he follow'd, that he
trod upon its heels, and thinking it to be his Wife, he was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to lay hold on her, crying, you Whore! But his hands
could catch at nothing, and his feet stumbling at the same time,
he fell down upon his Nose, and felt something that was pointed
running into his Breast: Thereupon he cry'd out in a most hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
manner, Murder, Murder, I am stabb'd—without let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
go his Wife, whom he thought, he held by the Hair, and
was strugling under him. His Cries and Oaths, set all the House
in an uproar, and every body ran to his Assistance, the Maid
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:53808:10"/>
with a Candle; <hi>Rancour</hi> and the Valet in their dirty shirts;
<hi>Cave</hi> in a tatter'd Petticoat; <hi>Destiny</hi> with a Sword in his Hand,
and Madam <hi>la Rappiniere</hi> last of all, who like all the rest, was
not a little surpriz'd to see her furious Husband grapling with
a she-goat, which was kept in the House to suckle some young
Puppies, whose Dam happen'd to die. No Man was ever so
much out of Countenance, as <hi>la Rappiniere:</hi> His Wife who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
suspected the truth of the Matter, ask'd him if he was Mad?
He answer'd without knowing well what he said, that he had
taken the Goat for a Thief; <hi>Destiny</hi> guess'd the business, every
one returned to his Bed, and made what Constructions he thought

                  <head type="sub">Which contains no great Matter.</head>
                  <p>THE Stroller <hi>Rancour,</hi> one of the principal Heroes of our
Romance, for one alone will not serve our turn; and since
there's nothing more perfect than the Hero of a Book, half a
dozen Heroes, or would be such, will do more credit to mine
than a single one, who might happen to be the least talk'd of,
since all Human things are subject to the caprice of Fortune.
<hi>Rancour,</hi> I say, was one of these Misanthropists who hate every
body, and do not love even themselves: Nay, I was told by
several creditable Persons, that no Man ever saw him Laugh. He
had a pretty deal of Wit, and an indifferent Talent in making
Doggrel Rhimes: He was not over-stock'd with Honour or
Conscience upon any account, and besides he was as malicious
as an old Monkey, and envious as a Dog. He found fault
with all those of his Profession, according to his Opinion; <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leroze</hi>
was too affected; <hi>Mindory</hi> too rough; <hi>Floridor</hi> wanted
Life, and so of the rest; by which he did insinuate, that he was
the only Player without a Fault, whereas he was suffer'd in the
Company, only upon the score of his being an old Stander.
When the Stage was reduc'd to <hi>Hardy</hi>'s Plays, he acted the Parts
of Nurses in a Treble-tone, and with a Vizor; but since the
Parts of Confidents, Ambassadors and Bailiffs Setters, when
there was occasion to attend a King, Murder any Body, or fight
a Battle; he Sung but scurvily the Tenor in <hi>Troies,</hi> and was
Jack-pudding in <hi>Farces.</hi> Upon these great Accomplishments, he
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:53808:11"/>
had built an unsufferable Pride which was attended with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exhausted
faculty of Railing and Slandering, and a quarrelsom
Humour, which however was supported by a little Courage:
All these made him to be fear'd by his Comrades, <hi>Destiny</hi> only
excepted, with whom he was as tame as a Lamb, and shew'd
himself as reasonable as his natural Inclination would suffer him.
'Twas once given out, that he was beaten by <hi>Destiny;</hi> but that
Report did not continue, no more than that about his having so
great an Affection for other People's Goods, that he would some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
seize upon 'em Clandestinely: Yet upon the whole, he was
the best Man in the World. Methinks I acquainted you before,
how he lay with <hi>La Rappiniere</hi>'s Man, <hi>Doguin</hi> by Name: Now
whether the Bed was none of the best, or that <hi>Doguin</hi> was but
an ill Bed-fellow, it so happen'd that he could not sleep a
wink all the Night long. He got up at break of day, (as well
as <hi>Doguin,</hi> who was call'd up by his Master) and going by <hi>La
Rapiniere</hi>'s Chamber, he went in to wish him good Morrow;
<hi>La Rappiniere</hi> receiv'd his Compliment with the State of a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-Provost,
and scarce return'd any of his Civilities; but as
Players are us'd to act all manner of Parts, so <hi>Rancour</hi> was lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
concern'd at it. <hi>La Rappiniere</hi> ask'd him a thousand Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
about the Stage, particularly, how long <hi>Destiny</hi> had been
one of their Company, adding, that he was a very good Player:
All is not Gold that glisters, reply'd <hi>Rancour:</hi> When I play'd
the first Parts, he Acted those of <hi>Pages;</hi> how the Devil
should he now understand a Trade, that he never learnt?
He has not been long upon the Stage, and Players do not come
up like Mushrooms in one Night. Now he is lik'd, because he
is young; but if you knew him throughly as I do, you would
not have half so good an Opinion of him; Besides, he is as
proud, as if he was lineally Descended from Saint <hi>Lewis,</hi> and yet
he won't tell us who he is, nor whence he comes, no more than
a handsom <hi>Phillis</hi> who accompanies him, under the name of Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
and grant Heaven she be no worse. Such as I am, I sav'd
his Life in <hi>Paris,</hi> at the expence of two great Wounds I receiv'd
with a Sword; and he was so unthankful for my good Office,
that in stead of seeing me carried to a Surgeon, he spent
the whole Night in looking in the Dirt for a certain Jewel enrich't
with Diamonds of <hi>Alencon;</hi> of which he said, he was robb'd
by those that set upon us. <hi>La Rappiniere</hi> ask'd <hi>Rancour</hi> when this
Mischance befell him? Upon Twelfth-Day on the New
Bridge, answer'd <hi>Rancour.</hi> These last words cast <hi>La Rappiniere</hi>
and his Man <hi>Doguin</hi> into a great trouble; they turn'd pale, and
blush'd; then blush'd, and turn'd pale again; and <hi>La Rappiniere</hi>
shifted the Discourse so quickly, and in so great a Disorder, that
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:53808:11"/>
                     <hi>Rancour</hi> wonder'd at it. The Hangman of the Town, and some
Archers who came into the Room, interrupted their Conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
at which <hi>Rancour</hi> was highly pleas'd; for he was sensible
that what he had said, had touch'd <hi>La Rappiniere</hi> in a very ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
part, though he was not able to guess what share he might
have in the Adventure. In the mean time, <hi>Destiny</hi> who had
been the Subject of his Encomiums, was in no small Trouble:
<hi>Rancour</hi> found him with Mistress <hi>Cave,</hi> wasting their Breath to no
purpose, to make an old Taylor confess, that he did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
well, and had workt still worse. The Matter in dispute
was this: At the taking the Play-house Furniture out of the
Cart, <hi>Destiny</hi> having found two Doublets and a pair of Breeches
much worn out, he gave them to this old Taylor in order to make
out of 'em a more fashionable Suit, than the Trunk Breeches he
had on; now the Taylor instead of making one of the Doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets
serve to mend the other Doublet, and the Breeches, through
a fault of Judgment, unworthy of a Man who had patch'd old
Cloaths all his Life-time, he mended both the Doublets with
the best pieces out of the Breeches; insomuch, that poor <hi>Desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi>
with so many Doublets, and no Breeches, was reduc'd ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to keep his Chamber, or to make all the Children run after
him, as they had done before, upon account of his Comical Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit.
<hi>La Rappiniere</hi>'s Generosity repair'd the Mistake of the
Taylor, who had the botch'd Doublets for his pains, and <hi>Destiny</hi>
was presented with a suit of Cloath's, the spoil of a High-way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
whom <hi>Rappiniere</hi> had caus'd to be broke upon the Wheel
not long before. The Hangman who happen'd to be there, and
had left those Clothes in the custody of <hi>La Rappiniere</hi>'s Maid, said
very saucily, that they were his Fees; but <hi>La Rappiniere</hi> silenc'd
him, by threatning him to turn him out of his place. The
Cloaths fitted <hi>Destiny</hi> to a hair, and so out he went with <hi>La
Rappiniere</hi> and <hi>Rancour:</hi> They all dined at a Tavern at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
of one of the Burghers, who had business with <hi>La Rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piniere;</hi>
and as for Mistress <hi>Cave,</hi> she past her time away in wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her dirty Nightrails, and kept her Landlady Company.
The same day <hi>Doguin</hi> met two of those young Men whom he
had beaten the day before in the <hi>Tennis-Court,</hi> and return'd
home with two great Wounds in his Guts, and abundance of
Cudgel-blows on his Back; and because he was dangerously ill,
<hi>Rancour</hi> having well Supp'd, went to the next Inn for a Bed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
with his Comrade <hi>Destiny,</hi> to attend Monsieur <hi>La Rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piniere,</hi>
who swore he would have Satisfaction for the Murder
of his Man.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>RAncour</hi> went into the Inn something more than half drunk:
<hi>La Rappiniere</hi>'s Maid who introduc'd him, bid the Hostess
get a Bed ready for him: Who have we here, said the Hostess?
Faith, had we no other Customers, our House-Rent would be
but ill paid. Hold your Tongue Hussy, said the Husband:
Mousieur <hi>la Rappiniere</hi> do's us too much honour: Quickly let a
Bed be got ready for the Gentleman—Ay marry, but where
shall one get it, said the Hostess; for there was but one left,
and I parted just now with it to a Merchant of <hi>Lower-Maine.</hi>
Thereupon the Merchant came in, and hearing the occasion of
their Dispute, offer'd one half of his Bed to <hi>Rancour,</hi> whether
he had Business with <hi>La Rappiniere,</hi> or because he was of an
obliging Nature; for which <hi>Rancour</hi> return'd him thanks, as
far as his small stock of Civility would let him. The Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
supp'd the Host kept him Company, and <hi>Rancour</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
much Entreaty, put in for a third, and begun to drink upon
a new Score. They discours'd about Taxes, rail'd against Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisemen,
setled the Nation, and unsetled their own Brains so
much, especially the Inn-keeper, that he lugg'd his Purse out of
his Pocket, and call'd for the Reckoning, having forgot that he
was at home; but his Wife and his Maid pull'd him by the
Shoulders into his Chamber, and laid him upon a Bed with his
Cloaths on; <hi>Rancour</hi> told the Merchant, that he was troubled
with a Strangury, and would be very sorry if he should incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mode
him; to which the Merchant reply'd, that a Night would
soon be over. Now you must take notice, the Bed had no
<hi>Ruelle,</hi> but was close to the Wall: <hi>Rancour</hi> went into it first, and
the Merchant being gone after him into the place of Honour,
<hi>Rancour</hi> ask'd him for the Chamber-pot—what to do, said
the Merchant? Why, to put it by me, to avoid being Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesom
to you, said <hi>Rancour;</hi> the Merchant reply'd, he would
give it him whenever he had occasion for it, to which <hi>Rancour</hi>
seem'd unwilling to consent, protesting he should be extream
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:53808:12"/>
sorry to trouble him. The Merchant fell asleep without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
him an answer, and scarce begun to be in a found sleep,
when the malicious Stroller, (who could have parted with one
of his Eyes, so as he might make his Neighbour lose both his)
pull'd the Merchant by the Arm, and cry'd to him, Sir, Sir;
the poor Merchant half a sleep, and gaping and stretching, ask'd
him what he would have? Pray reach me the Chamber-pot,
said <hi>Rancour;</hi> the Merchant lean'd over the Bed, and having ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
the Chamber-pot, gave it to <hi>Rancour,</hi> who put himself in a
pissing posture; and having us'd all his endeavours, or at least
seem'd to do so, mutter'd a thousand Oaths, and complain'd of
his Distemper; he return'd the Chamber-pot to the Merchant,
without making a drop of Water. The Merchant set it on the
ground again, and stretching his Mouth as wide as an Oven,
said to <hi>Rancour,</hi> truly Sir, I pity you, and fell asleep presently.
<hi>Rancour</hi> suffer'd him to indulge his Drowsiness, till he snor'd as
loud as the Drone of a pair of Organs, and then the Traytor
wak'd him again, and ask'd him for the Chamber-pot with as
much malice, as he had done before. The Merchant deliver'd
it into his hands with his usual kindness; and <hi>Rancour</hi> laid it
to the place through which one pisses, not so much with a design
to leak, as to keep the Merchant awake: He cry'd out still
louder than before, and was twice as long endeavouring in vain
to make Water, and desiring the Merchant not to give himself
the trouble to reach him the Chamber-pot, for that he would
reach it himself: The poor Merchant, who at that time would
have parted with half his Estate to have slept his Belly-full,
answer'd him gaping, that he might do as he thought fit, and
laid the Chamber-pot in its proper place again: They bid one
another good Night, in a very civil manner, and the poor Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
would have laid a round Sum, that he was going to take
the best Nap he ever had in his Life. <hi>Rancour,</hi> who knew well
enough where his Comedy should end, suffer'd him to fall into
a sound sleep, and then without making conscience to wake a
Man that repos'd so innocently, he laid his Elbow in the pit of
his Stomach, crushing him down with the whole weight of his
Body, and stretching forth the other Arm out of the Bed, like
one that has a mind to take up something from the ground. The
unfortunate Merchant, almost crush'd and stifled to Death, start<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out of his sleep, (crying out in a most hideous manner, Zouns,
Sir, what do you mean, you have almost kill'd me—<hi>Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour</hi>
with as soft and gentle a Voice as that of the Merchant, was
loud and vehement, answer'd him: I ask your pardon, I only
design'd to take the Chamber-pot—Udslife, cry'd the other,
I had much rather give it to you, and not sleep all the Night
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:53808:13"/>
long,—you have so hurt me, that I shall feel it as long as I
live. <hi>Rancour</hi> made him no answer, but fell a pissing so plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
and with such force, that the very noise of the Chamber-pot,
had been sufficient to wake the Merchant: At last he fill'd
the Pot, and return'd the Lord thanks with a villanous Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie.
The good Merchant wish'd him joy as well as he could,
for his plentiful ejaculation of Urine, which gave him hopes
his sleep would no more be interrupted: When the cursed <hi>Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour</hi>
(making as if he would set the Chamber-pot on the ground)
let fall both pot and piss on his Face, his Beard and his Breast,
excusing himself only with, Sir, I cry your mercy? The Merchant
return'd his Civility no answer; for as soon as he felt himself
drown'd in piss, he got out of Bed, roaring like a Mad-man,
and calling for a Candle; <hi>Rancour</hi> with a cunning Calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
told him, truly, 'tis a great Mischance! In the mean
time the Merchant rais'd the whole House with his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
Roaring, and the Inn-keeper, his Wife, Maids and
Servants being come to know what the matter was, he told
them, they had put him to bed with a Devil, and desir'd to
have a fire lighted in another Room; they ask'd him what ail<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d
him? but he was in such a Passion, that he gave no answer; and
taking his Cloaths in a Fury, went down into the Kitchin to
dry himself, and there lay all Night stretch'd on a Bench by
the Fire side. The Innkeeper ask'd <hi>Rancour</hi> what he had done to
him, to which <hi>Rancour</hi> with a counterfeit ingenuity answer'd,
I do not know what he can complain of—He wak'd out of his
sleep, and rouz'd me, crying out, Murder;—sure, he has
had some ill Dream or other, or is turn'd Mad, for besides, he has
bepist the Bed. Mine Hostess put her hand upon it, and said the
Gentleman spoke truly, that her Quilt was wet through, and
swore a great Oath, that she would make the Merchant pay for
it: They bid <hi>Rancour</hi> good Night, and so went their way. As for
<hi>Rancour,</hi> he slept as peacefully as any honest man might have
done, and made himself amends for the bad Night he had at
<hi>La Rappiniere</hi>'s. However he rose earlier than he design'd, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
call'd up by <hi>La Rappiniere</hi>'s Maid, who came running to
fetch him to <hi>Doguin</hi> who was a Dying, and desir'd to speak with
him before he made his Exit. He ran to him much perplex'd, to
know what a dying Man, with whom he got acquainted but
the day before, might have to say to him. But 'twas a mistake
of the Maid; for hearing the dying Wretch call for the Player,
she took <hi>Rancour</hi> for <hi>Destiny;</hi> who when <hi>Rancour</hi> came, had just
shut himself in <hi>Doguin</hi>'s Chamber, being inform'd by the Priest
who heard his Confession, that he had something of great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
to communicate to him. He had not been there above
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:53808:13"/>
a quarter of an hour, when <hi>La Rappiniere</hi> came home, having
been abroad at break a day about some Business: He was told
at his Arrival, that his man was breathing his last, the Surgeons
not being able to stop his Blood, (by reason one of his great
Veins was broke) and that he desired to see the Player <hi>Destiny</hi>
before he dyed. And has he seen him! ask'd <hi>La Rappiniere</hi>
very much disorder'd—answer was made, they were lockt in
together; at which words he was in a manner Thunderstruck,
and ran in a great Fright, and knockt at <hi>Doguin</hi>'s Chamber
Door, at that very time that <hi>Destiny</hi> was opening of it to call
for help; the sick Body being taken by a fainting Fit. <hi>La Rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piniere</hi>
with Trouble in his Face, ask'd him what his silly Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
had to say to him? I think he is Lightheaded, reply'd
<hi>Destiny</hi> coldly; for he ask't me pardon a thousand times, and I
cannot tell that he ever offended me; however, let somebody
look to him, for he cannot live long. Thereupon they made
towards the Bed, and at that very instant, <hi>Doguin</hi> gave up the
Ghost, at which <hi>La Rappiniere</hi> seem'd rather pleas'd, than concern'd.
Those who were acquainted with him, judg'd the reason of it
to be, because he ow'd him his Wages: But <hi>Destiny</hi> alone knew
best of any, what he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> ought to think of it. In the mean time
two men came into the House, whom our Stroller knew to be
his Comrades, of whom we will speak at large in the following

                  <head type="sub">The Adventure of the Litters.</head>
                  <p>THE youngest of the two Strollers who came to <hi>La Rappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piniere</hi>'s,
was <hi>Destiny</hi>'s Servant, of whom he learnt, that the
rest of the Company were all arriv'd, except Mistriss <hi>Star,</hi> who
had sprain'd her Foot, three Leagues off <hi>Mans.</hi> How came
you hither? Who told you we were here? said <hi>Destiny</hi> to him:
The Plague which is now at <hi>Alencon,</hi> hindred us from going
thither, and stopt us at <hi>Bonnestable,</hi> answer'd the Stroller, <hi>Olive</hi>
by Name; and some Inhabitants of this Town we met by the
way, inform'd us you Acted here; that you had fought, and
was Wounded; Mistriss <hi>Star</hi> is very much troubled at it, and
desires you to send her a Litter. The Keeper of the next Inn,
who was come at the report of <hi>Doguin</hi>'s Death, said he had a
Litter at home, and if they would pay him well, it should be
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:53808:14"/>
ready to go by Noon, carried by two strong able Horses. The
Strollers hired the Litter for a Crown, and took Chambers in
the Inn for the whole Company: <hi>La Rappiniere</hi> undertook to
procure a Licence, to act from the Deputy-Governor; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
Noon, <hi>Destiny</hi> and his Comrades took their Journey to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Bonnestable;</hi> it being a very hot day, <hi>Rancour</hi> slept in the
Litter, <hi>Olive</hi> was mounted on the hinder Horse, and the Inn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keepers
Man on the other before; <hi>Destiny</hi> trudg'd it on Foot
with a Gun over his Shoulder, and his Man entertain'd him with
what was befallen them from the Castle of <hi>Loir,</hi> to a Village
near <hi>Bonnestable,</hi> where Mistriss <hi>Star</hi> had sprain'd one of her Feet
as she lighted off her Horse; when two Men well Mounted, and
who hid their Faces with their Cloaks as they pass'd by <hi>Destiny,</hi>
rode up to the Litter on that side where it was uncover'd, and
finding in it but one Man asleep; he that was mounted on the
best Horse, said to the other; I verily believe, all the Devils
are t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

into Litters, to plague me. Which said, he clapt Spurs to his
Horse, and went his way cross the field with his Companion af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
him. <hi>Olive</hi> call'd <hi>Destiny,</hi> and recounted to him the Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
the meaning of which he could not understand, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
did he much trouble himself about it. After they had gone
a quarter of a League further, the Leader of the Litter whom
the heat of the Sun had stunn'd, and made drowsie, brought the
Litter into a Quag-mire, where <hi>Rancour</hi> was like to be over-turn'd;
the Horses broke their Traces, and they were fain to
unharness them, and pull them out of the Mire by Neck and
Tail. They gather'd the broken Remnants of their Wreck,
and reach'd the next Village as well as they could. Now, whilst
the shatter'd Furniture of the Litter was resitting, <hi>Rancour, Olive,</hi>
and <hi>Destiny</hi>'s Man, took a merry Cup at the gate of an Inn that
hapned to be in the Village. Whereupon there came another
Litter led by two Men on foot, which likewise stopt before the
Inn. This Litter was scarce arriv'd, but there appear'd another,
a hundred steps behind it. I believe all the Litters in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
have agreed to meet here, about some business of Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
in order to hold a General Council, said <hi>Rancour;</hi> and
methinks they ought to begin their Conferences, for 'tis not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
that any more will come. Nay, Marry, said the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stess,
here's another that will not stick out, I warrant you—
and in truth they espy'd a fourth, which came as from <hi>Mans.</hi>
This made them all laugh heartily, except <hi>Rancour,</hi> who never
laught, as I said before. The last Litter stopt with the rest, and
in the memory of Man, so many Litters were never seen toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
If those that look'd for Litters, and whom we met a
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:53808:14"/>
while ago, were here, they would have their Belly full of them,
said the Leader of the first Litter: I have met with him,
said the Second: So have we, said he that conducted
the Strollers Litter; to which he that came last added;
that he was like to be thresh'd by 'em. Why so? ask'd <hi>Destiny.</hi>
Because, answer'd he, they had a design upon a certain Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman,
who sprain'd her Foot, and whom we carried to
<hi>Mans:</hi> I never saw Men so furious and unreasonable; for they
quarrell'd with me only because they miss'd of what they look'd
for. This made the Strollers prick up their Ears; and by the
Answer of the Litter-Man to two or three Questions they put
to him, they were inform'd, that the Lady of the Lord of the
Village where Mrs. <hi>Star</hi> sprain'd her Foot, had given her a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit,
and taken great care to have her carried safe to <hi>Mans.</hi> The
Conversation continued a little longer between the Litters; and
they learnt of one another, that they were all search'd by the
same Men whom the Strollers saw. The first Litter carried
the Parson of <hi>Domfront,</hi> who came from the Wells of <hi>Belles<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>,</hi>
and went to <hi>Mans,</hi> in order to get the Physicians of that
Place to consult about his Distemper. The second carried a
wounded Officer, who return'd from the Army. At last the
Litters parted; those of the Parson of <hi>Domfront,</hi> and of the
Strollers went together to <hi>Mans,</hi> and the others where they
thought fit. The sick Parson lighted at the same Inn where the
Strollers were quartered, being the place where he us'd to lie on
that Road. We will leave him to take his rest in his Room,
and in our next Chapter we shall pay a Visit to the Strollers,
to see what was doing in theirs.</p>

                  <p>THE Strolling Company consisted of <hi>Destiny, Olive,</hi> and
<hi>Rancour,</hi> who had each a Servant, who expected to be one
Day an Actor in chief. Of those Servants, some began to speak
without blushing, or being dash'd out of Countenance: Among
the rest, <hi>Destiny</hi>'s Man acted pretty well, understood what he
spoke, and did not want Wit. Mrs. <hi>Star,</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Cave</hi>'s
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:53808:15"/>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>:
Besides all this, they had a Poet, or an Author; for all the
Grocers Shops in the Kingdom were stor'd with his Works,
both in Verse and Prose. This great Wit follow'd the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
almost against their own Will; but because he was no
Sharer, and that he spent his own Money with the Players
they suffer'd him to act Under-parts, which he generally mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd.
They all perceiv'd well enough, that he was in love,
with one of the two Players; but he was so discreet, though
a little crack-brain'd, that 'twas not yet discover'd which of them
he design'd to wheedle into compliance, with the fair Hopes of
making her Immortal. He threatned the Company with a
great many Plays of his own writing; but till then he had
spar'd them, and they only knew by Conjecture that he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
one, call'd <hi>Mar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>in Luther,</hi> of which they found the first
Act; which however he disown'd, although it was written
with his own Hand. When our Strollers arriv'd, the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens
Chamber was already fill'd with the most impertinent
Fops and Beaus of the Town, whose eagerness was almost
cool'd by the indifferent Reception they met with: They spoke
altogether about Plays, Poetry, Poets and Romances; and
there could not have been more noise in the Room, unless
they had been a fighting. The Poet, among the rest, sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded
by three or four, who, without doubt, were the top
Wits of the Town, labour'd to persuade 'em, that he had seen
<hi>Corneille,</hi> crack'd many a Bottle with St. <hi>Amant</hi> and <hi>Beys,</hi> and
lost a good Friend when <hi>Rotrou</hi> died. Madam <hi>Cave,</hi> and her
Daughter <hi>Angelica</hi> set their Goods in order, with as great a
Tranquility, as if no Body had been in the Room. 'Tis true,
<hi>Angelica</hi>'s fair Hands were now and then squeez'd or kiss'd<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

for these Country Gentlemen are ever pulling and haul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling;
but a kick on the Shins, a Box on the Ear, or a Biting,
according as occasion requir'd, soon rid her of those hot-spurr'd
Lovers: Nor was she rude and impudent neither, but her free
and gay Humour would not let her use much Ceremony: As
for the rest, she had Wit, and was very honest. Mrs. <hi>Star</hi>
was of a quite different Humour; for there never was a more
modest, gentile, and good-natur'd Woman in the World, and
she strain'd at that time her Complaisance so far, that she cou'd
not find in her Heart to turn these ogling Fops out of her Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
altho' she felt a great Pain in her sprain'd Foot, and had
great occasion for Rest. She lay in her Clothes on a Bed, sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded
by four or five of the whining sighing Beaus: stunn'd
by abundance of Puns and Clenches, which pass for good Jests
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:53808:15"/>
in the Country, and often forcing a Smile upon Things that she
did not like. But this is one of the great Plagues of that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
which together with the being oblig'd to laugh or weep,
whether one has a mind to it or no, takes very much from the
Pleasure which Players have, of being sometimes Emperors and
Empresses, and of being call'd as fine as Angels, though they be
little handsomer than Devils, or address'd to as young Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
although their Hair and Teeth be part of their Furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
There are a great many more things to be said upon this
Subject, but we must use them sparingly, and place them in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Places in this Book, for Variety's sake. Let's return to
Madam <hi>Star,</hi> beset with Country-Squires, the most troublesom
Race of Men, all great Talkers, most of 'em very impertinent,
and amongst whom there were some newly return'd from the
University. Among the rest appear'd a little Man, who was a
Widower, a Lawyer by Profession, and an Officer, in a small
Court of Judicature in the Neighbourhood: Since the Death
of his little Wife, he sometimes threatned the Women to
marry again, and sometimes the Clergy of the Province to
turn Priest, nay even a preaching Prelate. He was the greatest
little Fool that ever ran madding since <hi>Rollando.</hi> He had stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died
Books all his Life-time; and though the chief end of Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larship
be the Knowledge of Truth, yet he was as great a Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar
as a Page, proud and obstinate as a Pedant, and so bad a
Poet as to deserve to be drown'd, if the Government would
take care to rid the Kingdom of the troublesom Vermine of Rhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
Fools. Assoon as <hi>Destiny</hi> and his Comrades came into the
Room, without giving them the time to know who he was, he
offer'd to read to 'em a Poem of his own making, call'd <hi>The Deeds
and Atchievements of</hi> Charlemain <hi>in four and twenty Books.</hi> This
Proposal put all the Assistants into such a frigh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>s made their
Hair stand an end; but <hi>Destiny,</hi> who in this general Terror
preserv'd a little Judgment, told him smiling, that 'twas not pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
for them to give him the hearing before Supper. Well, quoth
he, I will read to you a Story taken out of a <hi>Spanish</hi> Book<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
which was sent me from <hi>Paris,</hi> and of which I design to make
a regular Play. They shifted the Discourse three or four times,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>on purpose to avoid hearing a Story, which they suppos'd
to be an Imitation of <hi>Guy</hi> of <hi>Warwick,</hi> or <hi>Tom Thumb.</hi> But tho'
they often interrupted him, yet our little Man did not lose
Courage; and with often beginning his Story, he at last forc'd
them to hear him out; however they did not repent, because
the Story prov'd to be a good one, and bely'd the ill Opinion
they had of all that came from <hi>Ragotin,</hi> for so was call'd out
<hi>Iack-in-a-Box.</hi> You will see the said Story in the following
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:53808:16"/>
Chapter, not such as <hi>Ragotin</hi> told it, but such as I had it my
self from one of the Hearers. Therefore, 'tis not <hi>Ragotin</hi> that
speaks, but my self.</p>

the Prize. What I find most advantageous in what you tell
me, answerd <hi>Don Carlos,</hi> is to have it, from the Mouth of a
Lady, who seems to be a Person of Merit; yet had I so much
as hop'd that any Lady had been on my side, I would have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
more care to deserve her Approbation. The unknown Lady
reply'd<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> he had given all the Proofs imaginable of his being a
most dextrous and accomplish'd Gentleman, and that by his
Black and White Liveries, he had shewn he was not in love.
I never was well acquainted with the meaning of Colours; an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd
<hi>Don Carlos,</hi> but this I know, that if I am not in love,
'tis not so much because I am indifferent, as because I am sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
I do not deserve to be belov'd. They said to one another
a Thousand fine Things more, which I shall not relate, because
I know nothing of 'em, and that I would be loath to compose
others, lest I should wrong <hi>Don Carlos</hi> and the unknown La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
who had a great deal more Wit than I can pretrend to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> as
I was dately inform'd by a young <hi>Neapolitan,</hi> who knew 'em both.
In short, the Lady in a Mask declar'd to <hi>Don Carlos,</hi> that 'twas
she who had an Inclination for him: He desir'd to see her
Face; which she refus'd and told him, That he must not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
it yet; that she would look for a more proper Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity;
and that<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> to let him know she fear'd not to trust her self
alone with him, that she would give him a Token. At these
Words she pull'd off her Glove, and shew'd the <hi>Spaniard</hi> the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
Hand in the World, and presented him with a Ring; which
he receiv'd, with so great a Surprize at the Adventure; that he
almost forgot to make a Bow, and thank her when the went
from him. The other Gentlemen, who out of Civility were
gone from him, being come to him again, he told 'em what
had happen'd to him, and shew'd them the Ring which was of
considerable Value. Every one spoke his Thoughts about the
Adventure; and <hi>Don Carlos</hi> was deep in love with the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
Lady<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> as if he had seen her Face. So great is the
Power of Wit on those who have their Share of it. He was
eight long Days without hearing from the Lady; but whether
or no he was uneasie at it<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the mean time he went every Day to divert himself at the
House of a Captain of Foot, where several Men of Quality
met to play. One Night, when he had not been, at Play, and
was going home, sooner than ordinary, he was call'd by his Name
out of a Parlour in a great House. He went near the Window,
which was l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

'twas his invisible Mistress, who told him; Come near, <hi>Don Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

I expect you here to decide our Controversie. You are but
a Brag, said <hi>Don Carlos,</hi> you challenge with Insolence, and yet

you hide your self eight Days together, and then appear only
through a Lattice Wind<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

time, answer'd she: 'Tis not for want of Courage I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay'd

there's yet a great inequality; for, added he, you both see
me, and know who I am, whereas I neither see you, nor know
who you are: Now think with your self, what I can judge of
your concealing your self? Since People seldom do so when
they have a good Design, it is an easie Matter to impose at

the Invisible Lady? You may call them rash if you please, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
<hi>Don Carlos;</hi> but however they are not unlikely. I
would have you know, said she, that I am sincere; you will
find me such in all our Intercourse; and I expect you should
be so too. That's but reasonable, answer'd <hi>Don Carlos;</hi> but
'tis just likewise that I should see you, and know who you
are. You shall be satisfied e're it be long, said the Invisible La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;
and in the mean time hope with Patience; for that's the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
way for you to obtain what you expect from me. Now, that
you may justifie your Love to your Discretion, I am willing
to let you know, that my Birth is not Inferiour to yours;
that I have a Fortune sufficient to make you live with as great
Magnificence as any Prince in the Kingdom; that I am rather
Handsom than Ill-favour'd; and as for Wit, you have too much
of that your self not to discover whether I have any or no.
She had no sooner made an end of her Speech but the with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew,
leaving <hi>Don Carlos</hi> with his Mouth open, ready to answer
her; so very much in love with a Person he never saw, and so
perplex'd about this odd way of Proceeding, which might prove
at last to be a Cheat, that he stood on the same place for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
a Quarter of an Hour, not knowing what to think of
this extraordinary Adventure. He was not ignorant that there
were a great many Princesses and Ladies of Quality in <hi>Naples;</hi>
but he knew likewise, that there were abundance of greedy Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tezans,
eager after Strangers, great Jilts, and the more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:53808:17"/>
as they were Handsom. I cannot positively tell whether
he had Supp'd, or went to bed without Supper.</p>
                  <p>Neither do I care to imitate the Writers of Romances, who
mark with great exactness all the hours of the Day, and make
their Heroe's rise betimes, relate their Adventures by Dinner-time,
eat but little at Dinner, then resume their Story after Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
or retire into the thickest part of a Wood, in order to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
their own selves, unless when they have something to say
to the Rocks and Trees: As Supper-time, they make them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair
at the usual Hour, to the place where they Diet, there
they sigh and look pensive, instead of eating; and thence they
go to build Castles in the Air on some Terrass-walk that looks
towards (the Sea, whilst the Trusty Squire reveals, that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
is such a one, Son to such a King; that he is the best
Prince alive, and thô he be still the handsomest of all Mortals,
that he was quite another Man before Love had disfigur'd him.)
To return to my story, <hi>Don Carlos</hi> repair'd the next day to his
Post, where the invisible Lady waited his coming: She ask'd
him if he had not been much perplex'd about their last Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation,
end if he had not doubted the truth of what she told him.
<hi>Don Carlos,</hi> without answering her question, desir'd her to tell
him what danger she fear'd in discovering her self, since they
were upon even Terms; and that the end of their Amours be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
honourable, it would have the approbation of every Body?
The danger is very great, and you will have it in time, said
the invisible: Once more be satisfi'd that I am true, and that in
the account I gave you my self, I was rather modest than vain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Don Carlos</hi> did not press her any further, other Conversation
which continued some time longer, encreas'd the mutual Love

The next day after there was a great Ball at the Viceroy's,
where <hi>Don Carlos</hi> hop'd to know his invisible Charmer; in the
mean time, he endeavourd to know at whose House she gave
him those favourable Audiences, and was told by the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
that the House belong'd to an old Lady, Widow to a
<hi>Spanish</hi> Captain, who had neither Daughters nor Neeces, and
liv'd very retir'd. He desir'd to wait on her, but she sent him
word, that since her Husband died, she admitted of no Visits,

                     <hi>Don Carlos</hi> went in
the Evening to the Viceroy's, where you may imagine there was
a very fine and numerous Assembly, and nicely observ'd all the
Ladies, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

in Conversation with several, but was disappointed in his search.

She was young and handsom, and her Voice not unlike that of
the Person he lookt for: But at the long run<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> he found such great
disproportion betwixt her Wit and his Invisible's that he was
sorry that in so little time, he had made such progress with this
fine Lady, that without any flattery to himself, he had reason
to believe she did not hate him. They danc'd several times to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and the Ball being over, to the small satisfaction of Don
<hi>Carlos,</hi> he took his leave of his Captive, whom he left full of
Pride; for having had to her self in so fine an Assembly, a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velier
who was envied by all the Men and esteem'd by all the
Women. As soon as he came out of the Ball, he went in great
hast to his House to take Arms, and from thence to the fatal
Gra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e, which was not far off: His Lady, who was there alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
ask'd him news of the Ball, although she had been there her
self. He told her very ingenuously, that he had danc'd with a
very beautiful Person, and entertain'd her all the time the Ball
lasted. She ask'd him several questions in relation to her which
discover'd her jealousie: and as for Don <hi>Carlos,</hi> he let her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
that he begun to doubt her Quality, by reason she was
not at the Ball; she having taken notice of it, us'd all the
charms of her Wit to remove his Suspicio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

as far as 'twas posible, in a Conversation that past with a Grate
between; adding withal, that in a short time she would become
visible. Hereupon they parted: Don <hi>Carlos</hi> very much in doubt
whether he ought to believe her, and she somewhat jealous of
the fine Person, whom he entertain'd during the Ball. The next
day <hi>Don Carlos</hi> going to hear Mass at a certain Church, the
Name of which I have forgot, offer'd Holy Water to two La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
vail'd, who went to take some at the same time with him:
She who appear'd in the better Cloaths of the two told him,
she never accepted of any Civility, from one with whom she
had a quarrel to decide. If you are not too much in hast, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd

<hi>Don Carlos</hi> talks of the high Reputation you have gain'd
during that little time you have been here, and every Body looks
upon you, as the most accomplisht Gentleman in the World:
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:53808:18"/>
The only thing that People wonder at is, your not taking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
that there are in this City some Ladies of Quality and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
who have a particular esteem for you; they have discover'd
it to you as far as Decency will allow, and though 'tis their ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
desire to make you sensible of it, yet they had rather you
had not taken notice of it through insensibility, than if you des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pis'd
their Favour through indifference. Among the rest, there's
one of my Acquaintance who has so much value for you, as to
hazard her own Reputation, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

are discover'd; that you rashly engage in an Amour
with one you do not know, and that since your Mistress conceals
her self, she must either be asham'd of her Lover, or afraid of not
deserving to be belov'd her self, I question not but the Object
of your Contemplative Love, is a Lady of great Quality and
Wit; and that your fancy has fram'd such a Mistress, as is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy

and of whom he could not rid himself. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>he reflected
the remainder of the day upon this Adventure, and suspected
at first the Lady of the Ball, to be the vail'd Person that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
last to him: But then calling to mind that the shew'd
abundance more Wit, than he had found in the other, he was
at a loss what to think of it, and wish'd almost not to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd
with his unknown Mistress, that he might give up himself
entirely to this last: But then again, considering that he knew
her no better than his invisible, whose Wit had charm'd him in
all the Conversation he had with her, he firmly resolv'd to be
constant to his first Choice, without minding in the least the
Threats of the last Lady; for he was not to be wrought
upon by Fear or Compulsion. That very Night he fail'd not
to repair to the Grated Window at the usual Hour, where in the
height of the Conversation with his Mistress, he was seiz'd by
four strong Men in Masks, who having Disarm'd him, carried
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:53808:19"/>
him by force into a Coach that waited for them at the end of
the Street. I leave the Reader to think, how many abusive
Names he gave to those Men in Disguise, and how he Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached
them for attacking him to Disadvantage on his side:
Nay, he endeavour'd to win 'em by promises, but instead of
persuading them, he only made them take more care of him,
and put him out of hopes of being able to shew either his Strength
or Courage. In the mean<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>time the Coach and six Horses drove
on a full Trot, and having got out of the City after an hours
Riding, came into a great House, the Gate of which was kept
open in order to receive it. The four Maskers alighted with
Don <hi>Carlos,</hi> holding him under the Arms like an Ambassador,
introduced to salute the Grand Signior: He was carried up one
pair of Stairs in the same manner, where two Gentlewomen in
Masks came to receive him at the door of a large Room, each
a Candlestick in her Hand, and the four Men in Disguise took
their leave of him with a profound Reverence. 'Tis probable
they left him neither Sword not Pistol, and that he did not
forget to thank 'em for their extraordinary care of his Person:
And yet perhaps he never thought on't; not but that he was a
Man of good Breeding, but upon a Surprize, a flip in point of
Civility ought to be forgiven. Neither will I tell you, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Candlesticks the Gentlewomen had in their Hands
were Silver; that they were at least, if not rather Silver-guilt
ingraven. As for the Room, it was the most Magnificent in
the World, and if you desire it, as well furnisht as some A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partments
of our Romances; Namely the Ship of <hi>Zelman</hi>
in <hi>Polexander;</hi> the Palace of <hi>Ibrahim</hi> in the <hi>Illustri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Room wherein the King of <hi>Assyria</hi> receiv'd <hi>Mandane</hi> in the
<hi>Cyrus,</hi> which together with the others I nam'd before, is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
a Book that has the best Furniture in the World. Now
imagine what Surprize our <hi>Spaniard</hi> was in, to find himself in
this stately Apartment with two speechless Gentlewomen in
Masks, who Conducted him into another Chamber, still better
furnisht than the great Room, and there left him all alone. Had
he been of <hi>Don Quixot</hi>'s Humour, he would have found suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Matter to please his Fancy; and imagin'd himself to be no
less than <hi>Espla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

concern'd at it, than if he had been in his Inn, save only that he
had a great Regret for his Invisible Lady; and as he kept his
Thoughts continually employ'd about her, he found that Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
more Melancholy than a Prison, which looks never pleasant,
but on the outside. He was easily perswaded, that these who
had provided him so fair a Lodging, were none of his Enemies;
and doubted not, but the Lady who spo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e to him the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:53808:19"/>
in the Church, was the Conjurer that rais'd all those En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantments.
He admir'd within himself the Fancy of Women,
and how soon they put their designs in Execution; as for him,
he resolv'd to wait patiently the end of this Adventure, and be
Faithful to his invisible Mistress, in spite of all the Threats and
Promises he might receive in his new Lodging. A little while
after, Servants in Masks, and in very good Cloaths came to lay
the Cloth, and then serv'd up Supper. Everything belonging
to it was Magnificent; Musick and Persumes were not forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten;
and <hi>Don Carlos</hi> not only gratifyed his Smelling and Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
but his Tast also; for he eat and drank, more than I thought
a Man in his condition could have done! But what's impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to so great a Courage! I forget to tell you that he wash'd
his Mouth; for I am inform'd he took great care of his
Teeth. The Musick play'd yet a while after Supper, and all
being withdrawn, <hi>Don Carlos</hi> fetch'd many a turn about the
Room, reflecting on all these Enchantments, or perhaps on some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else; then came in two Gentlewomen and a Dwarf all in
Masks, who without asking him whether he had a mind to go
to Bed, spread a Magnificent Toilet, in order to undress him.
He comply'd with them in every thing. The Gentlewomen
turn'd down the Bed-Cloaths, and then withdrew: The Dwarf
pull'd off his Shooes, Stockings, or Boots, and then his other Cloaths;
all which being done without exchanging a word, <hi>Don Carlos</hi>
went to Bed, and slept pretty well for a Man in Love. At
break of Day he was wak'd by the singing of Birds, that flutt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r'd
in an Aviary; the Dwars came to wait upon him, land brought
him the finest Linen in the World, and the best wash'd and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fum'd:
If you think it fit, I shall not mention what he did till
Dinner, (which was at least as good as Supper has been) but
pass to the first breaking of that profound Silence, which had
been observ'd to that very hour. A Gentlewoman in a Mask
began to speak, by asking him if he would be pleas'd to see the
Mistress of that Inchanted Palace. <hi>Don Carlos</hi> said, the should
be welcom: And a little while after she came in, attended<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>All the fine things he had seen in the other Rooms, I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
before, were nothing in comparison to what he found in
this last, which still receiv'd a new brightness from the Lady
in a Mask. They walk'd on the finest Foot-Carpet that ever
was seen, since Foot-Carpets have been in Fashion: There the
<hi>Spaniard</hi> was plac'd on an Arm-chair in spite of himself and the
Lady sitting by her self, on I know not how many fine Cushi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
over against him, she ravish'd his Ears with a Voice as
sweet as an Harpscical, speaking to him to this effect. I doubt
not, Seignior <hi>Don Carlos,</hi> but you are much surpriz'd with what
has hapn'd to you in my House, since yesterday; but if all that
is not able to move you, yet by it you may see I am as good as

I am able to do. Perhaps my Rival both by her Artifice, and

that the Lady might easily take notice, he spoke his true Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents.
She used all the Arguments she could think of to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suade
him, but he was deaf to her Prayerss and unconcern'd at
her Tears. She renew'd the Attack several times, but met still
with a stout Resistance. At last she began to Revile and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach

and there she left him, not to pick straws, but to curse a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred

too Happy. A Gentlewoman came a little while after to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
him, that he had the liberty to walk in the Garden. He
Traversed all these fine Apartments, without meeting with any
Body, till he came to the Stair-case, at the foot of which he
saw ten Men in Masks, who kept the Door, arm'd with Perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zans
and Carbines. As he was crossing the Court to go into <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

looking him in the Face, and told him, as thô he fear'd to
be heard: That an old Gentleman had trusted him with a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
which he promis'd to deliver into his own hands, tho' his
Life must answer for it, if he should be discover'd; but that a
Present of twenty Pistols, and a promise of as many more, made
him run all Hazards. <hi>Don Carlos</hi> promis'd to be Secret, and
went strait into the Garden, where he read the following Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>

                     <hi>Don Carlos</hi> was so Transported with Joy, to receive the News
from his Lady, with whom he was really in Love, that he kist
the Letter a hundred times over, and came back to the Garden
Door, to Recompense the Messenger with a fine Diamond Ring
he had on his Finger. He walk'd a little longer in the Garden,
still wondering at the Princess <hi>Porcia,</hi> whom he often heard Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
report to be a young rich Lady, of the best Families in
the Kingdom; and as he was a Man of strict Virtue, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
such an Aversion for her, that he resolv'd to break out of
his Prison, even at the hazard of his Life. As he came out of
the Garden, he met a Gentlewoman unmaskt, (for from that
time forward, every Body went bare-fac'd in the Palace) who
came to ask, if he would be pleas'd to have her Mistress eat
with him? And I leave you to think whether he answer'd, she
should, be Welcome. A little while after they serv'd up Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
or Dinner; for I have forgot which of the two it ought to
be. <hi>Porcia</hi> appear'd more bright and handsom, I said just now,
than <hi>Venus Citherea,</hi> and it will not be amiss, if for Variety
sake, I say now, than an Angel: She was charming in every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,
all the time they were at Table; and the <hi>Spaniard</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd
so much Wit in her, that he was in a manner sorry, to
find so many excellent Qualities, so ill bestow'd on a Person of
so high a Degree. He did all he could to appear in good Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
and force a pleasing Countenance, although he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
thinking upon his unknown Mistress; and burnt with
Impatience to return to the Lattice-window. As soon as the
Table was clear'd, they were left by themselves, and because
<hi>Don Carlos</hi> spoke not a word, either out of respect, or only to
oblige the Lady to speak first, she broke silence in these words.
I know not whether I ought to hope something form the Gaiety
I Fancy I have discover'd in your Face; and whether mine, which
you have seen already, does seem handsom enough to you, as
to make you doubt, whether that of your Invisible Mistress, has
more Charms to Captivate your Heart. I do not conceal what
I design'd to present you with, because I would not have you
repent the accepting of my Present; and though a Person
who is us'd to be instructed by others, be apt to be offended at a
Denial; yet I will forgive you, provided you repair your past
Offence, by giving me what I have more right to, than your
Invisible: Therefore tell me your last Resolution, that if in

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Madam, before I
answer what you would know of me, I must desire you, that
with the same frankness you expect from me, you would be
pleas'd to tell me your Sentiments, about what I am going to
propose to you. Suppose, added he, you had engag'd a Man to
love you, and that by all the Favours a Lady can grant without
wronging her Virtue, you had obliged him to swear an Inviola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Fidelity; would you not account him the basest and most
treacherous of Mankind, if he should fail in his Promise? And
were I not that Villain, and that Traytor, if I should leave
for you, a Person who has reason to think I love her? He was
going to frame abundance of Logical Arguments, in order to
convince her; but she did not give him time, and rising ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptly
from her Seat, told him: That she plainly saw the Drift of
his Discourse; that she could not but admire his Constancy, tho'
so much opposite to her own quiet; that she would set him at
Liberty, and that she only desir'd him to stay till Night, to go
back in the same manner he came. While she was speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
she held her Hankerchief to her Eyes, as though she design'd
to conceal her Tears, and left the <hi>Spaniard</hi> a little concern'd;
but yet so Transported with Joy for being again at Liberty,
that he had not been able to conceal it, had he been the greatest
Hypocrite in the World; and I verily believe, that had the
Lady taken notice of it, she would certainly have scolded at
him for it. I know not whether 'twas long before Night came,
for as I told you before I dont trouble my self any more, about
marking the Times or Hours; you must be contented to know
that Night came at last, and that he went into a close Coach,
and was set down at his Lodgings, after a pretty long way. As
he was the best Master in the World, so his Servants were like
to die with joy at the sight of him, and almost stifled him with
their Embraces; but they did not enjoy him long; for having
provided himself with Arms, and taken two of his stoutest Men
along with him, he presently went to the Grated-Window in
such great hast, that those who accompanied him, had much
adoe to keep pace with him. He had no sooner given the usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Signal, but his Invisible Deity communicated her self to him:
And they exchanged such soft and tender Expressions, that I
can't forbear weeping whenever I think on 'em. At last<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> the
Lady told him, she was lately Affronted in that House, and had
sent for a Coach in order to leave it; but because it might be a
long while a coming, she desir'd him to send for his, which
might be sooner got ready; and that she would carry him to a
place, where she would no longer conceal her Face from him.
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:53808:22"/>
The <hi>Spaniard</hi> needed no farther Intreaty, but ran like a Mad-man
to his Men, whom he left at the end of the Street, and sent for
his Coach in all hast. The Coach being come, the Invisible
Lady kept her Word, and went into it with <hi>Don Carlos.</hi> She di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
the Coachman which way he should drive, and bid him
stop at a great House, into which the Coach went by the light
of several Flamboys, which were lighted at their Arrival. The
Cavalier leading his Lady, went up stairs to a very large Room,
where he was a little uneasie, because she did not pull off her
Mask. At last several Gentlewomen being come to receive
them, each a Candlestick in their Hands, the Lady was Invisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
no longer; and pulling off her Mask, she let <hi>Don Carles</hi>
see, that the Lady at the Grated-Window, and the Princess
<hi>Porcia,</hi> were but one Person. I will not endeavour to describe
the pleasant Surprize of the <hi>Spaniard:</hi> The fair Neapolitan told
him, she had stollen him away a second time to know his last
Resolution; that the Lady at the Lattice had made over to her
all her Pretensions, and added a thousand Expressions, no less
obliging than ingenious. <hi>Don Carlos</hi> threw himself at her Feet,
embrac'd her Kness and devour'd as one may say, her Hands with
Kisses: By that means avoiding all the Impertinence and Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sense,
which People generally speak when they are Transport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with Joy. The Raptures of his Passion being over, he
us'd all his Wit, and Eloquence to extol the agreeable
Caprice of his Mistress, and exprest himself so well to her Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
that he confirm'd her, she was not mistaken in her
Choice. She told him, she had been unwilling to trust any Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
but her self in a thing, without which she could never have
lov'd him; and that she would never have bestow'd her self up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a Man less constant than himself. Thereupon the Princess
<hi>Porcia's</hi> Relations came in, having had notice given them of her
Design: And as they were the chief Men in the Kingdom, they
easily obtain'd a Dispensation from the Archbishop for their Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.
The same Night the Ceremony was perform'd by the
Parson of the Parish, who was an honest Priest, and a good
Preacher; and so 'twere needless to ask whether he made a fine
Exhorration upon the Subject. 'Tis said, they got up late the
next day, which I am inclin'd to believe. The News was soon
spread about, at which the Viceroy, a near Relation of <hi>Don
Carlos,</hi> was so overjoyd, that the publick Rejoycings began
anew in <hi>Naples,</hi> where to this day they talk of <hi>Don Carlos</hi> of
<hi>Arragon,</hi> and of his Invisible Mistress.</p>

                     <hi>RAgotin</hi>'s Story receiv'd a general Applause, and he valued
himself as much upon it, as if it had been his own; which
swelling his natural Pride, he begun to treat the <hi>Men</hi>-Players
with Contempt, and then accosting the Women, he took their
Hands without their consent, and offer'd to feel their Breasts;
a piece of Country Gallantry, which shews more a Satyr than
a Gentleman. Mistress <hi>Star</hi> contented her self to get her soft,
fair Hands from his dirty rough Clutches; but Mistress <hi>Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lica</hi>
her Companion, gave him a smiling wrap on the Fingers
with her Busk. He left 'em abruptly, without so much as
speaking a word, glowing with Rage and Confusion, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
to the Man's Company, where every one spoke as fast as
he could, without minding what the rest said. <hi>Ragotin</hi> silenc'd
most of 'em, by asking 'em with a Superior Voice, what they
thought of his Novel. A young Man, whose Name I forgot;
answer'd him bluntly, it was no more his, than any Body's else
in the Company, since he had it out of a Book; Whereupon he
pull'd one which stuck out of <hi>Ragotin</hi>'s Pocket, who scratch'd
his Hands to get it from him; but in spite of <hi>Ragotin,</hi> he put
it into another Man's Hands, from whom <hi>Ragotin,</hi> endeavour'd
to snatch it, to as little purpose, the Book having got by this
time into a third Man's Hands; in the same manner it pass'd
to five or six different Hands, which <hi>Ragotin</hi> could not reach,
because he was the shortest Man in the Company. At last ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
stretch'd himself five or six times in vain, torn half a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen
Cuffs, and scratch'd as many Hands, and the Book still tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling
about through the middle Region of the Chamber, poor
<hi>Ragotin,</hi> who saw every Body laugh at his Expence, rush'd like
a Mad-man upon the first Author of his Confusion, and dealt
him several blows on his Belly and his Thighs, not being able
to reach higher. The Hands of his Adversary, who had the
Advantage of the Place, fell five or six times so perpendicular,
and so heavy on the top of his Head, that the Crown of his
Hat sunk down to his very Chin; which so shook the seat of
his Reason, that the poor little Man did not know where he
was. To compleat his Defeat, his Antagonist at parting, gave
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:53808:23"/>
him a sound kick on the Head, which after a very sudden Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trogradation,
made him fall on his Breech, at the Women-Play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
Feet. Now if possible, I would have you to imagine the
Rage and Fury of a little Man, more proud than all the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
in the Kingdom, at a time when he was Cock-a-hoop a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
his Story; and that too, before Players, to whom he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd
to make Love; as you shall see anon, though he was yet
ignorant, which of 'em had a greater Title to his Heart. To
speak the Truth, his little Body thus tumbled on his Breech, did
so lively represent the Fury of his Soul, by the different Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of his Arms and Legs, that tho' his Face could not be seen,
because his whole Head was enchas'd in his Hat, yet all the
Assistants thought fit to join together, and make as it were a
Barrier 'twixt <hi>Ragotin</hi> and his Adversary, who by this means
got away, whilst the charitable <hi>Women</hi>-Players rais'd the poor
little Man, roaring like a Lion in his Hat, which stopt his Eyes
and his Mouth, and hinder'd him from fetching his Breath. Now
the difficulty was how to pull off his Hat; for its Crown being
in form of a Butter-pot, and the Mouth of it narrower than the
Bottom, God knows whether a Head that got it in by force, and
whose Nose was so very large, was able to get out of it the same
way. This Misfortune occasion'd a great good; for in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability
his Anger was at the highest, and without doubt, its
Effects had been answerable to it, had not his Hat which suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>focated
him, made him consult his own Preservation, rather
than to contrive the Destruction of another. He did not cry for
Help, because he had not the use of his Tongue: But when they
perceiv'd that he lifted up in vain his trembling Hands to his
Head, in order to set it at Liberty, and stamp'd the Floor with
Rage and Indignation, for tearing his Nails to no purpose, they
all bent their Thoughts on his Relief. The first Efforts they
made to pull off his Hat, were so violent, that he thought they
were going to pluck his Head from his Shoulders: At last be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
almost spent. he made signs with his Fingers to have his Hat
cut with a pair of Cizars. Mistress <hi>Cave</hi> unclapst those she wore
on her Girdle, and <hi>Rancour</hi> who was to perform the Operation,
having made a shew of making the Incision over against his Face,
(which did not a little fright him) at last he slit his Hat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
his Head, from top to bottom. As soon as he had given
vent to his Face, all the Company fell a laughing to see it so
bloated, as if it was ready to burst, for the vast quantity of
Spirits that flush'd to it; and besides, his Nose was Excoria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
However, the Jest had gone no farther, had not a bungling
Taylor advis'd him to get his Hat Fine-drawn. This unseaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
Advice so revived his Anger, which was not entirely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguish'd,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:53808:23"/>
that he laid hold of one of the Andirons, and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to fling it amidst the Company, put the stoutest of 'em all in
such a Fright, that every one ran to the Door, in order to avoid the
impending blow of the Andiron; they press'd so much upon
one another, that not above one was able to go out; and that
too by a Fall, his sparr'd Leggs having entangled themselves
with those of the rest. <hi>Ragotin</hi> fell a laughing in his turn, which
gave all the Company fresh Courage; they return'd him his
Book, and the Players lent him an old Hat. He fell into a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent
Passion against the Man who us'd him so scurvily; but
being more vain than Revengeful, he told the Players, with the
Air of one who was going to promise 'em some extraordinary
thing; that he had a mind to make a Play out of his story, and
wou'd contrive it so well, that he was sure to get as much Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
by that single Piece, as other Poets had gain'd by se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral.
<hi>Destiny</hi> told him, the Story he related was very Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining,
but not fit for the Stage. Sure, said <hi>Ragotin,</hi> I hope
you won't pretend to teach me; I would have you to know,
that my Mother was Seamstress to <hi>Garnier</hi> the Poet, and I my
self have one of his Ink-horns at home, <hi>Destiny</hi> reply'd, that
<hi>Garnier</hi> would get no Reputation by it, if he was to do it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
But what Difficulty do you find in it, ask'd <hi>Ragotin.</hi> The
Difficulty, answer'd <hi>Destiny,</hi> is, that it cannot be brought into
a regular Play, without committing a great many Faults, both
in point of Decorum and Judgment. As for that, said <hi>Roga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin,</hi>
a Man of my Parts, may make new Rules when he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.
Pray consider, added he, what a New and Magnificent
thing at once it would be, to represent a great Church-Gate on
the Front of the Stage, before which twenty Beaux more or
less, with as many Ladies, should speak a Thousand fine things
to one another, would it not Ravish all the Spectators with Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration?
I am so far of your Opinion, continued he, that one

would not make my Actors speak within the Church. <hi>Destiny</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
him, to ask him where they could get so many Gentlemen
and Ladies? And how do they do in Colleges, said <hi>Ragotin,</hi> where
they fight pitch'd Battels? I my self plaid at <hi>La Flesche,</hi> the Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
at the Bridge <hi>de Sé,</hi> added he; above a hundred Soldiers of
the Queen Mothers Party appear'd on the Stage, besides those of
the Kings Army, which was more Numerous: And I rememe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
that by reason of a great shower that spoil'd the sport, 't was
reported, that all the Feathers of the Country-Gentry, which
was borrow'd on this Occasion, would never come to themselves
again. <hi>Destiny,</hi> who took great delight in hearing him say all
these Judicious things, reply'd, that Colleges had Scholars enough
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:53808:24"/>
for that purpose, whereas their Company did never consist in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
seven or eight Persons: <hi>Rancour,</hi> who, you know, was a
malicious Dog, sided with <hi>Ragotin,</hi> the better to help to make
him ridiculous, and told his Comrade, he was not of his Opl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion:
that he had been a Player before him; that a Church-Gate
wou'd be the finest Scene that ever was seen; and as for
the necessary number of Gentlemen and Ladies, that they might
have some, and represent the rest with Pastboard. This fine Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient
of Pastboard, invented by <hi>Rancour,</hi> set all the Company
a laughing: <hi>Ragotin</hi> laugh'd with the rest, and swore he knew
it well enough, but had a mind to keep it to himself. As for the
Coaches, added he, Will it not be a Novelty in a Play? I former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
personated <hi>Tobiah</hi>'s Dog, and did it so to the Life, that
the whole Audience was highly pleas'd with it, taking me to be
a real Dog. As for me, continued he, if we may judge of Things
by the Effects they work upon our Minds, I never saw <hi>Pira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi>
and <hi>Thisbe</hi> acted, but I was less concern'd at <hi>Erasmus</hi>'s
Death, than frighted by the roaring of the Lion. <hi>Rancour</hi>
back'd <hi>Ragotin</hi>'s Reasons by others as ridiculous, and by that
means ingratiated himself so far with him, that <hi>Ragotin</hi> took
him to Supper with him. All the other Impertinents left also the
Players at Liberty; who had much rather go to Supper, than
entertain the idle Coxcombs of the Town.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>RAgotin</hi> carried <hi>Rancour</hi> into a Tavern, where he call'd for
the best Things the House could afford. 'Tis thought he
did not carry him to his own House, because his Commons
were but indifferent; but I will say nothing about it, for fear
of making rash Judgments; neither did I care to enquire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Truth of the Business, because I do not think it worth my
while, especially having Matters of far grater Importance to
realte. <hi>Rancour,</hi> who was a Man of great Discernment, and
knew his Men at first sight, no sooner saw a Brace of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridges
and a Capon serv'd up for two People, but he began to
think that <hi>Ragotin</hi> had some Design or other, and did not treat
him so well, either upon account of his own Merit, or to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pay
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:53808:24"/>
the Complaisance he had for him, in maintaining his Story
to be a good Subject for a Play. He therefore expected to hear
some new Extravagance from <hi>Ragotin,</hi> who, however, did not
discover his Thoughts at first, but continued speaking about his
Novel. He recited several Lampoons he had made upon most
of his Neighbours, upon some Cuckolds, that were nameless;
and upon some Women: He sung drunken Songs, and shew'd
him abundance of Acrosticks and Anagrams; which are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
the first things with which your paltry Rhimers being to
plague Men of Sense. <hi>Rancour</hi> made him a compleat Coxcomb;
for he cry'd up all he heard, with Eyes lifted up to Heaven,
and swore like a losing Gamester, that he never heard any
thing so fine: Nay, he was so transported, that he made a
shew of pulling off his Hair. He told him now and then, 'tis a
great Misfortune both for you and us, that you do not leave all
other Business to write for the Stage; for in two or three Years
time <hi>Corneille</hi> would be no more talk'd of, than <hi>Hardy</hi> is now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days.
I am, added he, an absolute Stranger to Flattery; but
to encourage you, I must needs own, I no sooner saw you, but I
read in your Face that you were a great Poet; and you may
know of my Comrades what I told 'em about it. I am seldom
mistaken: I smell a Poet at two Miles distance; and therefore
as soon as ever I cast my Eyes on you, I was acquainted with
you, as well as if I had brought you up. All this fulsom
Stuff went down with <hi>Ragotin</hi> as glib as several Glasses of
Wine, which he drank at the same time, and which intoxicated
his Brain, as much as <hi>Rancour</hi>'s Commendations swell'd his Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.
As for <hi>Rancour</hi> he eat and drank very briskly, erying
out now and then, for God's sake, Monsieur <hi>Ragotin,</hi> improve
your Talent: Once more let me tell you, you are much to
blame, not to make your Fortune and ours. For my part, I
scraul a little Paper as well as other People, but if I made
Verses half so good as these you have been reading to me, I
should not be so hard put to it to keep Life and Soul together,
but would live upon my Income as well as <hi>Mondors.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
Monsieur <hi>Ragotin,</hi> pray write; and if this next Winter
we do not eclipse the Companies of the <hi>Hostel de Bourgoyne,</hi> and
<hi>des Marez,</hi> may I never tread the Stage again without breaking
one of my Arms or Legs, I'll say no more, and so let's drink. He
was as good as his Word; and having pet a double Measure
into a Glass, he drank Monsieur <hi>Ragotin</hi>'s Health to Monsieur
<hi>Ragotin</hi> himself, who did him Reason accordingly, and return'd
it with the Health of the (Women) Players. This he drunk
Cap in Hand, and in such a Rapture, that as he laid the Glass
on the Table, he broke its Foot, without taking notice on't.
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:53808:25"/>
and went three or four times to set it upright, but finding it
impossible, he at last flung it over his Head, and pull'd <hi>Rancour</hi>
by the Sleeve, to let him know he had the Honour of breaking
a Glass in drinking the Players Health: It vex'd him a little
that <hi>Rancour</hi> did not laugh at it; but, as I said before, he was
rather an envious than a risible Animal. <hi>Rancour</hi> ask't him,
What he thought of their Women?—The little Man
blush'd without giving him an Answer: But <hi>Rancour</hi> putting
the same Question to him again, at last, what by his Sturter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
his Blushing, and his broken Speech, he let <hi>Rancour</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
he lik'd one of the Players extremely. But which of em?
said <hi>Rancour.</hi> The little Man was so disorder'd for having said so
much, that he answer'd, I don't know—Nor I neither,
said <hi>Rancour.</hi> This Reply cast him into greater Disorder; and,
with a bewilder'd Look, he said, 'Tis, 'tis—He repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the same Word five or six times over again; at which the
Stroller growing impatient, I like your choice, said he, she's a
very beautiful Person. This put him quite out of Countenance,
insomuch that he could never tell which he lov'd most; though
it may be he knew nothing of it himself, or that his Passion
was rather Lust than Love. At last <hi>Rancour</hi> naming Mrs. <hi>Star</hi>
to him, he said, 'Twas she with whom he was in love: For my
part, I verily believe, that had he nam'd either <hi>Angelica,</hi> or
her Mother <hi>Cave,</hi> he had forgot the Blow he had receiv'd with
a Busk from the one, and the Age of the other, and given him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
Body and Soul, to the very first that <hi>Rancour</hi> had nam'd. So
great was the Trouble of Goatish <hi>Ragotin.</hi> The Stroller made
him drink a great Bumper, which carried off part of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion,
and pledg'd him with another; which done, he looking
about the Room, whisper'd, as though it were a great Secret,
though there was no Body. Well, your Wound is not
mortal, and you have address'd your self to one who is able
to cure you, provided you will be rul'd by him, and keep
Counsel, not but your Enterprize is very difficult; for Mrs.
<hi>Star</hi> is a very Tygress, and her Brother <hi>Destiny</hi> a Lion: But she
does not see Men every Day like you, and I know what I can
do, Let's drink out our Liquor, and to morrow will be Day,
They drank each a Glass of Wine, which interrupted their
Conversation for a while. After that <hi>Ragotin</hi> had recounted all
his Accomplishments and Riches, and told <hi>Rancour,</hi> that a <hi>Nephew</hi>
of his was Clerk to a <hi>Financier;</hi> that this <hi>Nephew</hi> had contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a great Friendship with the <hi>Partisan de Ralliere,</hi> during the
time he was at <hi>Mans,</hi> to settle an Excise-Office there; and
by the means of his <hi>Nephew</hi>'s Interest he endeavour'd to give him
Hopes that he would procure him such a Pension from the King as
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:53808:25"/>
his Players in Ordinary had. He told him likewise, That if
any of his Relations had Children, he would prefer 'em in
the Church; because his Niece was married to the Brother of
a certain Miss, kept by the Steward of an Abbot of that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
who had good Livings in his Gift. Whilst <hi>Ragotin</hi> was
thus relating what great Interest he had, who the more he drank
the more thirsty he grew, was still filling both the Glasses,
which were emptied in an instant, <hi>Ragotin</hi> not daring to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
any thing from the Hands of a Man from whom he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
such a great piece of Service. In short, they swill'd
till they had both their fill. <hi>Rancour,</hi> according to his custom,
grew more serious, and <hi>Ragotin</hi> so dull and heavy, that he laid
his Head down on the Table, and fell asleep. <hi>Rancour</hi> call'd
one of the Maids to make a Bed ready for him, because no Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
was up at his Inn. The Maid told him, she had as good
make two, for she was sure Monsieur <hi>Ragotin</hi> wanted one. In
the mean time he slept and snor'd as well as ever he did in his
Life, for all the Noise they made while they were putting
clean Sheets to two of the three Beds that were in the Room:
But when the Maid came to wake him, and acquaint him his
Bed was ready, he call'd her a Thousand Whores, and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to beat her. At last <hi>Rancour,</hi> having turn'd him in his
Chair towards the Fire, at which the Sheets were air'd, he
rubb'd and open'd his Eyes, and suffer'd himself to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drest
without repining. They got him into his Bed as well
as they could; and <hi>Rancour,</hi> having first made the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber-Door
fast, went into his. About an Hour after, <hi>Ragotin</hi>
got up, to what purpose I never could learn. He rambled a
long time about the Room, not knowing where he was; and
having overturn'd all the Chairs and Tables he met in his Way,
and tumbled down himself several times, without being able to
find his Bed again; he went at last to <hi>Rancour</hi>'s, and pulling his
Bed-cloaths made him start out of his Sleep. <hi>Rancour</hi> ask'd
him, What he would have? I look for my Bed, said <hi>Rago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi>
—'Tis on the Left Hand of mine, reply'd <hi>Rancour.</hi> The
little drunken Man took to the Right, and thrust himself be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the Rug and the Straw-bed of the third Bed, which
had neither Feather-bed, Quilt, nor Sheets, and there he slept
all Night very quietly till next Morning. <hi>Rancour</hi> got up and
dress'd himself before <hi>Ragotin</hi> wak'd; and then ask'd him,
Whether; 'twas to do Pennance that he left his Bed to sleep on
Straw? <hi>Ragotin</hi> was positive that he never got up, and that the
Room must be haunted. The Inkeeper hearing this, stood up
for the Reputation of his House, and picking a Quarrel with
<hi>Ragotin,</hi> threatned to sue him for giving it an ill Name. But
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:53808:26"/>
I have sufficiently exercis'd your Patience with the tedious
Story of <hi>Ragotin</hi>'s Debauch, let us return to the Strollers

                  <p>I Am too much a Man of Honour not to advertise the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
Reader, that if he be offended at all the silly Trifles
he had already seen in this present Book, he will do well not to
go on with the reading of it; for, upon my Conscience, he must
expect nothing else, altho' the Book shou'd swell to the bigness
of the <hi>Grand Cyrus:</hi> And if from what he had read, he doubts
what will follow, perhaps I am in the same Doubt as well as
he: for one Chapter draws on another, and I do with my Book
as some do with their Horses they bestride, having the Bridle on
their Neck, and trusting to their good Conduct. But perhaps I
have a fix'd Design, and without filling my Books with Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
for Imitation, I shall instruct with Delight in the same
manner as a drunken Man creates in us an Aversion for Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenness,
and may sometimes divert us by his merry Imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence.
Let's end this Moral Reflexion, and return to our
Strollers, whom we left in the Inn. As soon as their Room
was clear'd, and <hi>Rancour</hi> got with <hi>Ragotin,</hi> the Door-keeper
they left at <hi>Tours</hi> came into the Inn, with a Horse loaden with
Goods, and sat down to Supper with 'em. By this Relation,
and what they learnt from one another, they understood how
the Intendant of the Province cou'd do them no harm, having
had much ado to escape himself from the Hands of the boi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous
Mob, with his Fuziliers. <hi>Destiny</hi> told his Comrades how
he got away with his <hi>Turkish</hi> Habit, with which he design'd to
represent <hi>Marret</hi>'s <hi>Soliman;</hi> and that being inform'd that the
Plague was at <hi>Alencon,</hi> he was come to <hi>Mans</hi> with <hi>Cave</hi> and
<hi>Rancour,</hi> in the same Equipage we have describ'd in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of these most true, though little Heroical Adventures. Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress
<hi>Star</hi> acquainted 'em also with the good Offices she receiv'd
from a Lady at <hi>Tours,</hi> whose Name never came to my Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and how by her Means she was conducted as far as a
Village near <hi>Bonnestable,</hi> where she sprain'd her Foot as she a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted
off her Horse. She added that hearing the Company
was gone to <hi>Mans,</hi> she got her self carried thither in a Litter,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:53808:26"/>
which the Lady of that Village lent her with a great deal of
Civility. After Supper, <hi>Destiny</hi> alone stay'd in the Lady's Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber;
<hi>Cave</hi> lov'd him as if he had been her own Son; Mistress
<hi>Star</hi> was no less dear to her; and her Daughter and only Heir
<hi>Angelica,</hi> lov'd <hi>Destiny</hi> and <hi>Star,</hi> like a Brother and a Sister.
She did not yet exactly know who they were, nor upon what
Account they turn'd Players; but she had taken notice, that
though they call'd one another Brother and Sister, yet they were
better Friends than near Relations, that <hi>Destiny</hi> paid to <hi>Star</hi> the
greatest Respect imaginable; that she was extream modest and
virtuous: and as <hi>Destiny</hi> had a great deal of Wit, and seem'd
to have a liberal Education, so Mistress <hi>Star</hi> look'd more like a
young Lady of Quality, than like a Stroller. Now <hi>Destiny</hi> and
<hi>Star</hi> were belov'd by <hi>Cave</hi> and her Daughter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, because they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
deserv'd their Love both by their good Qualities, and the
mutual Friendship which they naturally had for two Players,
who had as much Merit as any in <hi>France,</hi> though they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
had the good Fortune to tread either of the two Theaters
in <hi>Paris,</hi> which are the <hi>Non plus ultra</hi> of <hi>French</hi> Players. Those
who do not understand these three little <hi>Latin</hi> Words (which
came so pat in my way, that I could not refuse to place 'em
here) may be pleas'd to ask some <hi>Latinist</hi> of their Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
the meaning of 'em. To end the Digression; <hi>Destiny</hi>
and <hi>Star</hi> did not scruple to express their mutual Fondness be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Cave</hi> and <hi>Angelica,</hi> and shew the extream Joy they had
to see each other after so long an Absence. They related, as
pathetically as ever they cou'd. how uneasie they were about
each other; and <hi>Destiny</hi> acquainted Mrs. <hi>Star,</hi> that the last
time they acted at <hi>Tours,</hi> he thought he spy'd their inveterate
Persecutor amongst the Crowd of their Auditors, although
he had his Cloak about his Face; and that as he went out
of the City, not finding himself able to resist him, if he should
offer to attack him with his Force, he had disguis'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
by putting a great Patch on his Face. He told her af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards,
how many Litters they met with when they went to
fetch her, adding, he was much mistaken if their common E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
was not the same unknown Man, who search'd so nicely
all the Litters, as you have seen in the seventh Chapter. Whilst
<hi>Destiny</hi> was speaking, poor Mistress <hi>Star</hi> cou'd not forbear shed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
some few Tears: <hi>Destiny</hi> was sensibly touch'd with 'em;
and having comforted her as well as he cou'd, he added, that if
she wou'd suffer him to use the same Endeavours in seeking
out their Enemy, as he had us'd till then in avoiding him, he
wou'd soon free her from his Persecutoins, or lose his Life
in the Attempt. These last Words redoubled her Grief: <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiny</hi>
                     <pb n="42" facs="tcp:53808:27"/>
had not Courage enough not to grieve also; and <hi>Cave</hi>
and her Daughter, who were of a tender and compassionate
Temper, griev'd, either out of Complaisance, or by Contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and I believe they did even weep. I cannot tell whether
<hi>Destiny</hi> wept, but this I know, that the Women and he were
silent a long while; and in the mean time every one wept as they
thought fit. At last <hi>Cave</hi> renew'd the Conversation which Tears
had interrupted, and reproach'd <hi>Destiny</hi> and <hi>Star,</hi> that though
during all the time they had liv'd together, they might have
seen how much she was their Friend, yet they repos'd so little
Confidence in her and her Daughter, that they were still unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with their Birth and Quality; adding she had not
met with Crosses enough in her Life, to be able to advise unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
Persons, such as they seem'd to be. To which <hi>Destiny</hi>
answer'd, that their not discovering themselves to her, was
not out of any Distrust, but because he thought the recital of their
Misfortunes could not but be very tedious; telling her withal, he
would be ready to entertain her with the Story of their Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
whenever she was willing to throw any time away upon
the hearing of it. <hi>Cave</hi> was glad of this Opportunity of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying
her Curiosity; and her Daughter, who had the same
eager Desire, being sat near her on <hi>Stat</hi>'s Bed. <hi>Destiny</hi> was
going to begin his Story, when they heard a great Noise in
the next Chamber. <hi>Destiny</hi> stood listning a little while; but
the Noise and the Squabble encreas'd instead of ceasing, and
some Body cry'd out, Murder, Help, Murder—<hi>Destiny</hi>
with three Leaps got out of the Chamber, at the Expence of
his Doublet, which <hi>Cave</hi> and <hi>Angelica</hi> tore as they were going
to stop him. He went into the Chamber from whence the Noise
came, which was so dark that he could not see his own Nose;
and where the Fisty-cuffs, Boxes on the Ears, and several
confus'd Voices of fighting Men and Women, together with
the hallow Noise of naked Feet stamping on the Floor, made
an hideous and frightful Uproar. He ran very rashly amongst
the Combatants, and in one Moment receiv'd a Cuff on one side,
and a Box on the Ear on the other; which changed his good
Intention of parting those Hobgoblins, into a violent Thirst of
of Revenge. He began to set his Hands a-going. and made a
Flourish with his two Arms, by which many a maim'd Chops
were abus'd, as it afterwards appear'd by his bloody
Fists. the Scuffle lasted so long till he receiv'd twenty
Cuffs more which he returnd with double the Number.
In the heat of the Fight, he felt himself bit at the Calf of the
Leg, and clapping his Hands to it, he met with something hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
which he took to be a Dog; but <hi>Cave</hi> and her Daughter
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:53808:27"/>
who appear'd at the Chamber Door with a Candle, like the
fire of Saint <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> after a Storm, espy'd <hi>Destiny,</hi> and let him
see he was amidst seven Persons in their Shirts, who being in
close Conflict before, begun to let one another go, as soon as the
light appear'd: This Tranquility did not last long: The Innkeeper
who was one of the naked Combitants, grappl'd the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et
anew; <hi>Olive</hi> who was also amongst 'em, was attack'd by the
Innkeeper's Man; another of the Combatants, <hi>Destiny</hi> went to
part em; whereupon the Hostess, who was the Animal that
bit him, and whom he took for a Dog, because she was bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed,
and had short Hair, flew at his Face, assisted by two
Maids, as naked and bearheaded as her self. The Shreeks and
Cries fill'd the Air once more, the Cuffs and Boxes made the
Room ring again, and the Fight grew still warmer than before.
At last several Persons who wak'd at the Noise, came into the
Field of Battel, parted the Combatants, and procur'd a second
Suspension of Arms. Now the question was to know the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the Quarrel, and what fatal Accident had brought seven
naked Persons into one Room. <hi>Olive,</hi> who seem'd the least con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
of all, said, that the Poet was gone out of the Room,
and that he saw him come back as fast as he could run, follow'd
by the Innkeeper, who had a mind to beat him; that the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stess
follow'd her Husband, and fell foul of the Poet; that as
he was going to part 'em, a Servant and two Maids fell upon
him; and that the Light happening to go out at the same time,
made the Fight last longer than 'twould have done. Now
'twas the Poet's turn to speak for himself: He said, that he had
made two of the finest Stanza's that ever were written, since
Stanza's were in Fashion; and fearing to lose 'em, he went to the
Maid of the Inn for a Candle, which they scornfully refused
to give him; that the Inn-keeper call'd him Rope-dancer, which
he return'd by calling him <hi>Cuckold.</hi> He had no sooner spoke the
word, but the Host who was within reach, gave him a good
slap on the Chops; you would have thought they made a fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Consort together; for as soon as the box on the Ear was
given, the Inn-keeper's Wife, his Man and his Maids rush'd
upon the Strollers, who receiv'd 'em with sound Cuffs. This
last Encounter was more fierce and obstinate, that the other
two. <hi>Destiny</hi> having clos'd with a lusty Wench, and tuck'd up
her Smock, gave her a Thousand flaps on the Butrocks; <hi>Olive,</hi>
who saw the Company pleas'd with it, did the same to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Maids. The Inn-keeper was busie with the Poet; and the
Hostess, the most Furious of all the Combatants, was seizd by
some of the Spectarors, which made her fly into such a Passion,
that she cry'd out, Theves. Her Cries awak'd <hi>La Rappiniere,</hi>
                     <pb n="44" facs="tcp:53808:28"/>
who liv'd over against the Inn. He caus'd the Door to be
open'd, and judging by the Noise he heard, that there could
be no less than seven or eight People kill'd upon the Spot; he
parted the Fray in the King's Name; and having learnt the
cause of all the Disturbance, he Exhorted the Poet not to make
any more Verses in the Night-time, and was like to beat the
Inn-keeper and his Wife for giving a hundred abusive Names

swearing withal, to turn them out of Doors the next day; but

                  <head type="sub">The History of Destiny and Mistress Star.</head>
                  <p>I was born in a Village near <hi>Paris,</hi> and I might make you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that I came of a very Illustrious Family, since no Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
can disprove what a stranger says of himself; but I am too
Generous, and too much a lover of Truth, to deny the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of my Extraction. My Father was one of the Topping,
and most Substantial Men in his Village, whom I often heard
say, that he was a poor Gentleman's Son; that he spent his
Youth in the Wars, where having got nothing but dry Blows,
and empty Pockets, he betook himself to the Service of a rich
<hi>Parisian</hi> Lady, in the Quality of her Gentleman-Usher; and
that having scrap'd a Sum of Money in his Place, (because he
was also the Steward and Caterer of the House, and had the
knack of emptying his Mistress Purse to fill his own Pockets)
he Marryed an old Waiting-woman of the Family, who dy'd
soon afte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, and left him all she got in her Service. Being soon
weary of his condition of a Widower, and no less of that of a
Servant. he Marryed a Country-woman, who furnish't his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy's
House with Bread: And 'tis to this last Marriage I owe
my Birth. My Father was call'd <hi>Gariques;</hi> what Country he
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:53808:28"/>
was of, I never could learn; and as for my Mother's Name,
it signifies nothing to my Story. Let it suffice, that she was
more coverous than my Father, and my Father more covetous
than she, and that they had both a pretty large Conscience. My
Father had the Honour of being the inventer of the piece of
Flesh tied with a string to the Pot-handle, which having boil'd
a considerable time, may be taken out again, and serve several
times to make Soop. I could tell a hundred more pieces of
Husbandry, which gain'd him with Justice, the Reputation of
a Man of Wit and Invention; but for fear of being Tedious,
I will content my self with relating only two, which may seem
Incredible, though most certainly true. He bought up a great
quantity of Corn, with design to sell it very dear, if the year
should prove bad; but the Harvest being plentiful, and Corn
falling in its Price, he was so possess'd by Despair, and the
Devil, that he had a mind to hang himself. One of his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
who happen'd to be in the Room when he enter'd upon
that Noble Design, and had hid her self for fear of being seen,
(for what reason, I know not) was not a little Surpriz'd, when
she saw him hang on one of the Joynts of the Cieling. She
ran to him, crying out, help, help; she ran to cut the Rope,
and by the help of my Mother, who came to the Noise, got it
from his Neck: Perhaps they repented the doing of so good
an Action, for he beat 'em both to Mummy; and made that
poor Woman pay for the Rope she had cut, by stopping some
Money he ow'd her. His other Prowess is no less strange: He
grudged himself whatever he eat, and his Wife being brought
to bed of a Boy, the Fancy took him in the Crown, that she
had Milk enough to Nourish both his Son and himself; and
hop'd, that by sucking his Wife, he would save Bread, and live
upon a Food of easie Digestion. My Mother's Wit was much
inferior to his, though her Avarice was as great; but though
she did not invent things as my Father did, yet having once
conceiv'd 'em, she put 'em in execution more exactly than he.
She therefore try'd to nourish both her Son and Husband with
her own Milk, and ventur'd also to feed upon it her self with
so much Obstinacy, that the little Innocent Creature was starv'd
to Death; and my Father and Mother so weakned, and so fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish'd,
that when they came to eat, they Surfeited themselves,
and fell both Sick upon it. Some time after my Mother went
with Child with me, and having happily brought forth a most
unhappy Creature; my Father went to <hi>Paris,</hi> to desire his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress
to stand Godmother to his Son, with an honest Church-Man,
residing at his Village where he had a Benefice. As he
was returning home in the Evening, to avoid the heat of this
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:53808:29"/>
Day, and pass'd through a great Strect in the <hi>Suburbs,</hi> the Houses
whereof were for the most part a building; he saw afar off by
the Moon-shine, something that glister'd to his Eyes, as it was
crossing of the Strect. He did not think it worth his while to
enquire what it was; but hearing the Groans of one in Pain,
at the same place where what he had seen vanish'd out of
sight, he boldly enter'd one of those unfinish'd Buildings, where
he found a Woman sitting on the Ground. The place she was
in, receiv'd sufficient Light from the Moon, as to let my Father
perceive that she was very young, and very richly clad, having
a Gown of Silver Tissue, which was the glistering thing my
Father saw a Moment before. You must not question, but my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
who did not want Resolution, was less surpriz'd than the
young Lady; but she was in a condition, that nothing worse
could happen to her. This Consideration gave her the assurance
to speak first, and tell my Father, that if he was a Christian,
he would take pity on her; that she was in Labour ready to
be brought to Bed, and the Maid she sent for a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>usty Midwife,
not returning, she slipt away from her House, without waking
any Body, her Maid having left the Door open, that she might
come in again without making a Noise. She had scarce made
an end of this short Relation, when she was deliver'd us a Child
which my Father receiv'd into the Lappet of his Cloak. He
acted the Midwife as well as he could, and the young Lady
conjur'd him to carry away the little Creature with all speed,
to take care of it; and not to fail two days after, to go to an
old Churchman she nam'd to him, who would give him Money,
and all necessary Orders for the Nursing of the Child. At this
word Money, my Father who had a penurious Soul, was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to display all the Eloquence of a Gentleman-Usher, but
she would not give him time; she put into his hands a Ring,
for a Token to the Priest he was to go to from her; caus'd him
to swaddle the young Creature in her Neck-handkerchief, and
sent him away in hast, <hi>Maugre</hi> his unwillingness to leave her in
the condition she was in. I am inclin'd to believe, she had much
adoe to get home again; as for my Father, he return'd to his
Village, gave the Child to his Wife, and did not fail two days
after, to go to the old Priest, and shew him the Ring. He
learnt of him, that the Child's Mother was a young Lady of a
very good Family, and very rich, that she got this Child by a
<hi>Scotch</hi> Lord, who was gone into <hi>Ireland</hi> to raise Soldiers for the
King's Service; and that this Foreign Lord had promis'd her
Marriage. Moreover the Priest told him, that by reason of her
precipitate Delivery, she was fallen desperate sick, and being in
that Extremity, she consest all to her Father and Mother, who
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:53808:29"/>
instead of Chiding her, endeavour'd to Comfort her, because
she was an only Child; that the thing was a Secret in the House,
and afterwards he assur'd my Father, that if he would take care
of the Child, and keep Council, his Fortune was made. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
he gave him fifty Crowns, and a bundle of all sorts of
things necessary for a Child My Father return'd home after he
had well Dined with the Parson. I was put out to Nurse, and
the Stranger kept at home in my stead. A Month after the
<hi>Scotch</hi> Lord came back, and having found his Mistress so very
ill, that she would not live much longer, he married her one day
before she died, and so was no sooner Husband, than Widower.
He came two or three days after to our Town, with the Parents
of his Wife. There they began to weep afresh, and were like to
stif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>le the Child with Kisses; my Father had reason to be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to the <hi>Scotch</hi> Lord for his Generosity, and the Parents of the
Child did not forget him. They return'd to <hi>Paris</hi> very much
satisfied with the Care my Father and Mother took of their Son,
whom they would not yet take to <hi>Paris</hi> with them, because the
Marriage was still kept Secret, for some Reasons which never
came to my Knowledge. As soon as I was able to walk, my
Father took me home, to keep the young Earl of <hi>Glaris</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
(for so he was call'd by his Father's Name). The Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Antipathy which is said to have been between <hi>Iacob</hi> and
<hi>Esau,</hi> in the very Womb of their Mother, was never greater
than that which was between the young Earl and me. My Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and Mother lov'd him tenderly, and had an Aversion for
me, though I was the more hopeful Boy of the two: There
appear'd nothing but Mean in him: As for me, I seem'd to be
what I was not, and rather an Earl's Son than <hi>Gariquet</hi>'s; and
if I am at last no more than a wretched Player, 'tis undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
because <hi>Fortune</hi> had a mind to be reveng'd upon <hi>Nature,</hi> for
designing to make me something without her help; or if you
please, because Nature is sometimes willing to favour those
whom Fortune is cross to. I shall pass over in Silence,
the Infancy of two young Clowns, (for <hi>Glaris</hi> was such
by inclination, as much as my self) since our most Memorable
Adventures were nothing but abundance of Fisty-cuffs. In all
the Quarrels we had together, I always got the better of him,
except when my Father and Mother sided with him, which they
did so often, and with so much Heat, that my Godfather Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
Saint <hi>Sauveur</hi> by Name, was highly offended at it, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
me of my Father. He made him a present of me with
great Joy, and my Mother had yet less Regret than he to lose
me. Thus I was at my Godfathers well Clad, well Fed; much
Caress'd, and never beaten. He spar'd no Cost to make me
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:53808:30"/>
learn to Read and Write; and as soon as I was fit to learn <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin,</hi>
he obtain'd of the Lord of the Village, who was a very
civil Gentleman, and very Rich, that I should study with two
of his Sons, under a Learned Man he had from <hi>Paris,</hi> and
to whom he gave a very good Salary. This Gentleman, the
Baron <hi>d'Arques</hi> by Name, took great care to have his Sons well
brought up. The eldest call'd Saint <hi>Far,</hi> was a handsom Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,
but as untractably rough and brutish in his Nature, as
ever any Man was; to make amends, the young Brother was
both handsomer than Saint <hi>Far,</hi> and had a Vivacity of Mind,
and a Greatness of Soul equal to the Beauty of his Body. In
short, I do not think there ever was a more hopeful young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
than <hi>Vervelle,</hi> for this was the younger Brother's Name.
He honour'd me with his Friendship, and as for me, I lov'd
him like a Brother, and ever respected him as a Master. As
for Saint <hi>Far,</hi> he had none but ill Inclinations, and I cannot bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
express the Sentiments he had both for his Brother and me,
than by telling you, that he lov'd not his Brother more than
me, for whom he had a great indifference; and that he hated
me no more than he did his Brother, whom he lov'd but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle.
His Diversions were indifferent from ours, for he lov'd no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but Hunting, and quoted Books of Morality; whereas
<hi>Vervelle</hi> seldom went out a Hunting, and took great delight in
Reading, wherein I agreed wonderfully with him, as in every
thing else, without being put to the trouble of doing any thing
out of Complaisance, as in Duty I ought. The Baron <hi>d'Arques</hi>
had a large Library of Romances: Our Tutor who had
never read any in his College, who at first forbad us the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of 'em and had condemn'd 'em a hundred times before the
Baron <hi>d'Arques,</hi> to render 'em as odious to him, as he found 'em
Delightful, grew at last so much in Love with 'em himself, that
having devour'd both the old and the new ones, he confest that
the reading of good Romances, was as Instructive as Pleasant,
and no less proper to inspire young People with Noble Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
than the reading of <hi>Plutarch.</hi> He therefore encourag'd
us to read 'em, as earnestly as he had discourag'd us before, and
first of all advis'd us to peruse the Modern; but these were not
yet suitable to our Palate, and till we were fifteen, we were
much more delighted by the reading of <hi>Amadis de Gaul,</hi> than
<hi>Astrea;</hi> and other fine Romances that have been made since,
by which the <hi>French</hi> have shewn to the World, as by a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
things besides; that if they do not invent so much as other
Nations, yet they bring the Inventions of others to a far great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Persection. We therefore bestow'd upon the reading of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances,
the greatest part of the time we had allow'd us for Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version.
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:53808:30"/>
As for Saint <hi>Far,</hi> he call'd us the Ruyters, and went
abroad every day either to Hunt, or to beat the poor Country
Fellows, which he did with wonderful Succes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. The Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
I had to do well, gain'd me the Favour of the Baron <hi>d'Arques,</hi>
who lov'd me no less, than if I had been his near Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
He would not suffer me to leave his Sons, when he
sent 'em to the Academy, but sent me thither along with 'em;
rather as a Companinon, than a Servant. There we stay'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
two year to learn our Exercises, at the end of which time,
a Man of Quality, Related to the Baron <hi>d'Arques,</hi> raising Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
for the <hi>Venetians,</hi> Saint <hi>Far</hi> and <hi>Verville</hi> persuaded their
Father to let 'em go to <hi>Venice</hi> with their Kinsman. The good
Gentleman desir'd that I should accompany 'em still, and Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>de Saint Sauveur</hi> my Godfather, who lov'd me extreamly,
gave me very gener ously Bills of Exchange for a considerable
Sum, to make use of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> in case those I had the Honour to
accompany, should be unwilling to bear my Charges. We went
the longest way about on purpose to see <hi>Rome,</hi> and the other
fine Cities of <hi>Italy,</hi> in each of which we staid a considerable
time, excepting those which are in the <hi>Spaniard</hi>'s Hands. I fell
sick at <hi>Rome,</hi> and the two Brothers went on their Journey; the
Gentleman under whose Conduct they were, being willing to
lay hold on the Opportunity of the Pope's Gallies, which were
putting out to Sea to joyn the <hi>Venetian</hi> Army near the Streights
of the <hi>Dardanells,</hi> where they waited for the <hi>Turks. Verville</hi>
was extraordinary sorry to leave me, and I almost mad to part
from him at a time, when by my Services I might in some
measure have deserv'd the Love he had for me. As for Saint
<hi>Far,</hi> I believe he lest me with as much indifference, as if he
had never seen me; and I never thought on him, but only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he was Brother to <hi>Verville,</hi> who left me as much Money
as he could spare; but whether Saint. <hi>Far</hi> was consenting, I
cannot tell. Thus I was sick at <hi>Rome,</hi> having no other Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
besides my Landlord, a <hi>Fleming</hi> Apothecary, who
took extraordinary care of me during my Illness, and who, as
far as I can judge, had more Skill in Physick, than the <hi>Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi>

to entertain their Curiosity. I took a singular delight in veiw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Vines, (thus are call'd several Gardins, finer than the <hi>Tuil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in <hi>Paris,</hi> which Cardinals and other Persons of Quality
keep with much cost in <hi>Rome,</hi> rather out of Vanity, than for
their own Entertainment, since they never, or at least very sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
go there themselves,) One day as I was walking in one
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:53808:31"/>
of the finest, I saw at the turning of a Wall, two Women very
genteelly drest, whom two young <hi>Frenchmen</hi> stopt, and would
not let go, unless the youngest of 'em unvail'd her Face. One
of those two <hi>Frenchmen</hi> who look'd like the Master of the other,
had even the insolence to offer to unvail her by force, whilst his
Man held the other, who was barefac'd I was not long deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
what I should do on this occasion, but told presently to those
rude Men, that I was resolv'd not to suffer the Violence they
offer'd to those Women. They were both very much surpriz'd,
for I spoke with such Resolution, as would have daunted 'em,
had they had their Swords as well as my self. The two Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
came over to me, and the young <hi>Frenchman</hi> chusing ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to be balk'd than beaten, told me as he went away; Sir,
for all your Hectoring, we shall meet you in some place or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
where the Swords shall not be all on one side. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd
I would not hide my selfe: His Man follow'd him, and
so I staid with the two Women. She that had no Vail on, look'd
to be about five and Thirty: She return'd me thanks in good
<hi>French,</hi> without any Mixture of <hi>Italian,</hi> and told me amongst
other things, that if all <hi>Frenchmen</hi> were like me, the <hi>Italian</hi>
Women would not scruple to live after the <hi>French</hi>

a Sun which dazl'd my Eyes. I never beheld so Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
an Object in my Life: she cast three or four times her
Eyes on me, as it were by stealth, and as they still met with
mine, the innocent Blushes which over-spread her Face, made
her look as handsom as an Angel. I perceiv'd the Mother was
very fond of her, for she seem'd to share the Pleasure I had in
looking upon her. Now by reason I was little us'd too these
Adventures; and that young People are easily dash'd out of
Countenance in strangs Company, I made 'em but indifferent
Complements when they went away, and gave 'em perhaps but
an ill Opinion of my Wit. I was angry with my self for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
asking their Habitation, and that I did not offer to wait upon 'em
thither; but 'twas Preposterous to run after 'em. I went to the
Door-keeper to inquire whether the knew 'em, but we were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

long while before we could understand one another, because he
spoke no better <hi>French,</hi> than I did <hi>Italian.</hi> At last, rather by
Signs, than otherwise, he gave me to understand that, they
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:53808:31"/>
were unknown to him, at least he would not own he knew'em.
I return'd to my <hi>Fleming</hi> Apothecary, in a very different Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposition
of Mind from what I was in when I came out;
that is to say, very Amorous, and very much in Pain to know
whether that beautiful <hi>Leonora,</hi> was a Courtezan or an honest
Woman, and if she had as much Wit as her Mother, who seem'd
to have a great deal. I abandoned my self to thinking, and
flatter'd my self-with a Thousand fair Hopes, which entertain'd
me a little while, but disquieted me much more when I consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
the Impossibility of my Wishes. Having fram'd a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
frivolous Designs, I resolv'd at last to seek 'em out, not
thinking it possible for 'em to remain long invisible in <hi>Rome,</hi>
(which is not a populous City,) especially to a Man so much in
love as I was. That very Day I look'd for 'em where-ever
I thought it most likely to find 'em, and return'd home more
tir'd and uneasie than I was when I went out. The next Day I
sought 'em still with more diligence, but did nothing but tire and
disquiet my self yet more. By my peeping through the Lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice-
Windows, and my hasty running after all the Women
that bore the least Resemblance to my <hi>Leonora,</hi> I was taken an
Hundred times, both in the Streets and in the Churches, for
the greatest Fool among those <hi>Frenchmen</hi> who have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
most in disparaging their Nation at <hi>Rome.</hi> 'Tis
Matter of Wonder how I could gather Strength at a time
when I suffer'd like one in Hell: However my Body recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
whilst my sick Mind remained so divided betwixt Honour
and Love, which kept me at <hi>Rome,</hi> that I often doubted whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
I should obey the frequent Letters I receiv'd from <hi>Verville,</hi>
who conjur'd me by the Ties of our Frienship, to come to him,
without using the Right he had to command me. At last, all
my Endeavours to find out my unknown Ladies, proving inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual,
I paid my Landlord, and got my little Eq<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ipage rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
in order to depart. The Day before I was to go, Signior
<hi>Stephano Vanberge</hi> (for so was my Landlord call'd) told me, he
design'd to give me a Dinner at a Mistress's House, and make
me confess, he had not made an ill Choice for a <hi>Fleming;</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
withal, that he would not carry me to her before I was
to go away, because he was a little jealous. I promis'd to
wait on him, rather out of Complaisance than Inclination;
and accordingly we went about Dinner-time. The House we
went into had neither the Appearance, nor the Furniture of an
Apothecary's Mistress. We travers'd a very fine Parlour; from
whence I entred first into a Magnificent Room, where I was
receiv'd by <hi>Leonora</hi> and her Mother. You may imagine how
much I was agreeably surpriz'd. The Mother of that Beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:53808:32"/>
Daughter came towards me, to be saluted after the <hi>French</hi>
way; and I must needs own, that she kiss'd me, rather than I her:
I was so amaz'd, that I scarce could see any thing, neither did I
hear one Word of the Compliment she made me. At last I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd
both my Senses and my Sight, and saw <hi>Leonora</hi> more
Beautiful and Charming than before, but had not the Assurance
to salute her. I was sensible of my Fault as soon as I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
it; but instead of repairing it, I blush'd as much out
of Shame, as <hi>Leonora</hi> did out of Modesty. Her Mother told
me, she design'd to return me Thanks before I went away, for
the Pains I had taken to find out their Habitation; and this
still encreas'd my Confusion. She pull'd me into a
<note n="*" place="margin">Bed-side.</note> 
                     <hi>Ruelle,</hi> adorn'd after the <hi>French</hi> Fashion, where her
Daughter did not follow us, because, I suppose,
she did not think it worth her while to join Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
with so dull a Fellow as I seem'd to be. She
staid with Signior <hi>Stephano,</hi> whilst with her Mother I act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Clown to the Life. She was so civil as to find Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to keep up the Conversation all alone; which she did
very ingeniously; though nothing can be more difficult, than to
shew one's Wit with those that have none at all. For my part I
never was such a Blockhead in my Life; and if she was not
tir'd with me then, she never was so with any Body. Amongst
other things, to which I scarce answerd Yes or No, she told me,
that she was a <hi>French</hi> Woman born, and that Signior, <hi>Stephano</hi>
would inform me of the Reasons which staid her in <hi>Rome.</hi>
By this time, Dinner being ready, she was fain to pull me along
to the Table, as she had pull'd me before to the <hi>Ru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>lle;</hi> for I
was so disorder'd, that I did not know how to set one Foot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
'tother. I was the same dull Loggerhead both before and
after Dinner; during which, the only thing I did with Assurance,
was to stare upon <hi>Leonora.</hi> I fancy she was uneasie at it, and
to punish me for it, she never lifted up her Eyes all the while.
Had the Mother been silent, the Dinner had been like a <hi>Carthusian</hi>
Meal; but she discours'd Sign. <hi>Stephano</hi> about the Affairs of <hi>Rome;</hi>
at least I fancy so, for I am not very sure of it. At last we rose
from Table, to the great Comfort of every Body, except my
self, whose Distemper grew worse and worse every Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
When we went to take our leave, they told me a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
obliging Things, which I only answer'd with the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Complement we use at the bottom of a Letter: However I
did something more at Parting than I did when I came in; for
I saluted <hi>Leonora,</hi> and by that means compleated my Ruin. <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phano</hi> was not able to get one single Word from me in all our
Way home. I lock'd my self in my Room, without pulling off
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:53808:32"/>
either my Cloak or Sword. There I revolv'd in my Mind what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
had happen'd to me. <hi>Leonora</hi> presented her self to my Fansie
more Beautiful than ever she appeard to my Sight. I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
how dull and silly I had been before the Mother and the
Daughter; and as often as I thought on it, I was so asham'd
that I could not forbear blushing. I wish'd to be Rich: I curs'd
my mean Extraction; and then I fancy'd to my self a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
lucky Adventures, advantageous both to my Fortune and my
Love. At last, having nothing in my Thoughts but how to
frame a plausible Pretence to stay, and not finding any to my
liking, I grew so desperate, as to wish to fall sick again, to
which I had already no small Disposition. I design'd to write
to <hi>Leonora;</hi> but all I could write did not please me, and so I put
into my Pocket the beginning of a Letter, which perhaps I had
not dar'd to send, had it been finish'd. Thus having disquieted
my self to little purpose, and not being able to banish <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nora</hi>
from my Thoughts, I resolv'd to go by the Vine where she
appear'd to me first of all, to abandon my self entirely to my
Passion, and pass by her Door once for all. This Vine was
well seated in one of the remotest Places of the City, in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
of several old empty Buildings. As I pass'd along, pensive and
Melancholy under the Ruins of a Portico, I heard some Body
stalk behind me, and at the same time I felt my self run
through under the Reins, I presently fac'd about, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
drew my Sword; and finding I had to do with the
Servant of the young <hi>Frenchman</hi> I mention'd before, I was like
to return him at least as good a Pass as he made at me by
Treachery: But as I push'd him a good way without being able
to close with him, because he maintain'd a running Fight, and
endeavour'd to parry, his Master came out from among the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ins
of the Portico, and attacking me behind, dealt me a stun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Blow on the Head, and a great Thrust in the Thigh, which
made me fall down. There was no likelihood of my escaping
at so cheap a rate; but because in an ill Action People<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> seldom
preserve a Presence of Mind, the Servant wounded his Master in
the Right Hand; and at the same time two <hi>Minime</hi> Fryars of
the <hi>Trinity</hi> of the <hi>Mount,</hi> who pass'd that way, and saw me trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherously
assaulted, running to my Help, my Assassins made their
escape, and left me wounded in three several Places. Those good
Fryars happen'd to be <hi>Frenchmen,</hi> to my great Comfort; for in
so remote a Place, had an <hi>Italian</hi> seen me in the Condition I was
in, he would rather have avoided then succour'd me, lest being
found doing me a good Office, he were suspected of being him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
my Murderer. Whilst one of those charitable Fryars re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
my Confession, the other ran to my Lodging, to acquaint
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:53808:33"/>
my Landlord with my Disaster: He came instantly to me, and
caus'd me to be carried, half dead, into my Bed. With so
many Wounds, and so much Love, 'twas not long before I fell
into a most violent Fever. My Life was despair'd of by all, and
I had no Reason to hope better than the rest. In the mean time
my Passion for <hi>Leonora</hi> was so far from abating, that it was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
encreasing, though my Strength grew weaker and weaker.
Wherefore, not being able to support so heavy a Burden, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
easing my self of it, nor resolve to die, without letting <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nora</hi>
know, that 'twas only for her sake that I wish'd to live, I
call'd for a Pen and Ink. They thought I was Light-headed;
but I was so earnest in protesting that they would drive me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Despair in case they should deny me, that Signior <hi>Stephano,</hi>
who had taken notice of my Passion, and was so clear-sighted as
to guess at my Design, gave Orders that I should have all things
necessary to write; and as he knew my Intention, he staid all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
in the Room. I perus'd again what I had scribled a little
before, with Design to make use of some Thoughts which came
before into my Head about the same Subject, and then I wrote
thus to <hi>Leonora.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I no sooner saw you, but 'twas out of my Power to forbear lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
you, My Reason did not oppose my Love, but told me, as well
as my Eyes, that you were the most lovely Person in the World; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
it should have represented to me, how unworthy I was of your
Love. However, that would have serv'd only to exasperate my Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease
with unprofitable Remedies, and after having strugled a while,
I must at last have yielded to the irresistible Necessity of loving you,
which you impose on all that see you. Well, I love you, my charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Leonora,</hi> but with so much Respect, that you ought not to hate
me for it, although I have the Boldness to discover it to you: But
how is it possible to die for you, without boasting of it? And how
can you refuse to pardon a Crime, with which you cannot reproach me
long? I own your being the Cause of a Man's Death is a Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
not to be merited but by a great Number of Services, and you
will perhaps cnvy me an Happiness, which you procure me without
Design. But do not grudge it me, lovely <hi>Leonora,</hi> since 'tis no more
in your Power to make me lose it, and that 'tis the only Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
I ever receiv'd from Fortune, who will never sufficiently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
your Merit, but by procuring you Adorers as much above me,
as all other Beauties in the World are below yours. Therefore I
am not so vain as to think that you will bestow the least Sentiment
of Pity on—</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="55" facs="tcp:53808:33"/>I was not able to make an end of my Letter; my Strength
fail'd
me on the sudden; the Pen fell from my Hand, for my
Mind went so fast, that my Body could not keep pace with
it; else that long beginning you have heard, had been but a
small part of my Letter; so much was my Imagination warm'd
by my Fever and by my Love. I was a long time in a faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Fit, without giving the least Sign of Life; which Signior
<hi>Stephano</hi> perceiving, he open'd the Chamber Door to send for a
Priest. In that very Moment <hi>Leonora</hi> and her Mother came to
visit me, having been inform'd of my being wounded. Now
as they thought this Accident besel me upon their Account, and
therefore that they were the innocent Cause of my Death, they
did not scruple to come to see me in the Condition I was in.
My Trance lasted so long, that they went away before I was
come to my self again, very much afflicted, as one may ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
and fully persuaded that I would never recover. They read
what I had been writing; and the Mother, more curious than
the Daughter, perus'd also the Papers I left on the Bed; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
which there was a Letter from my Father <hi>Garignes.</hi>
I was a long time struggling betwixt Life and Death; but at
last Youth got the better on't; in a Fortnight's time I was out
of Danger; and in five Weeks I began to walk about the
Room. My Landlord entertain'd me often about <hi>Leonora.</hi> He
acquainted me with the charitable Visit, which she and her
Mother had given me; at which I was over-joy'd: And if I
was a little troubled at their reading my Father's Letter, I was
highly pleas'd that my own had been read also. As often as I
happen'd to be alone with <hi>Stephano,</hi> I could talk of nothing but
<hi>Leonora.</hi> One Day calling to mind what her Mother told me,
that he could inform me who she was, and what Reasons ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
her to stay in <hi>Rome,</hi> I desir'd him to acquaint me with
what he knew about it. He told me, that she was come to
<hi>Rome</hi> with the <hi>French</hi> Ambassador's Lady; that a Man of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
a near Relation of the Ambassador, was fallen in Love with
her; that in time she lov'd him too, and that being married
clandestinely, she had the beautiful <hi>Leonora</hi> by him: He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
me likewise, that that Nobleman was fallen out with all
the Family of the Ambassador upon this Account, which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
him to leave <hi>Rome</hi> and go to <hi>Venice</hi> with Madam <hi>la
Boissiere</hi> (for this was her Name) till the time of the Embassy
was expir'd; that having brought her back to <hi>Rome,</hi> he fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd
her a House, and gave her all Necessaries to live like a
Person of Quality, whilst he staid in <hi>France,</hi> whither his
Father call'd him back, and whither he durst not carry his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:53808:34"/>
or, if you please, his Wife, well knowing that none of his
Relations would approve his Match. I must confess I could not
sometimes forbear wishing that <hi>Leonora</hi> were not the Legitimate
Daughter of a Person of Quality, that the Blemish of her Birth
might excuse the Meanness of mine; but soon repented so Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal
a Thought, and wish'd her Fortune were answerable to
her Merit. Tho' this last Thought cast me into Despair; for as
I lov'd her more than Life it self, I plainly foresaw that I could
never be happy without enjoying her, nor enjoy her without
making her unhappy. When I began to recover, and that there
was no other Remains of my Distemper, but a great Paleness in
my Face, occasion'd by the vast quantity of Blood I lost, my
young Masters return'd from the <hi>Venetian</hi> Army, the Plague
which infected all the <hi>Levant,</hi> not suffering them to signalize their
Courage there any longer. <hi>Verville</hi> had still the same Affection
he ever had for me, and Saint <hi>Far</hi> did not yet shew he hated me,
as he has done since. I recounted to them all my Adventures,
except my falling in Love with <hi>Leonora.</hi> Both express'd a
great desire of being acquainted with her, which my exagge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating
the Merit both of the Mother and the Daughter encreas'd.
A Man ought never to commend the Person he loves before those
who may love her also, since Love enters at the Ears as well as
at the Eyes. This Folly has often been pernicious to those who
were guilty of it, which my own Experience will justifie, as
you shall see anon. Saint <hi>Far</hi> ask'd me every Day when I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd
to carry him to Madam <hi>la Boissiere:</hi> One Day, when he
was more pressing than ordinary, I answer'd, I could not tell
whether she would admit of his Visit, because she liv'd very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir'd.
Nay, reply'd he, I now plainly see you are in love with
her Daughter; and adding, he knew how to go to see her with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
me, in a very blunt manner, I was so daunted<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> that he firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
believ'd, what he did scarce suspect before. Afterwards he
pass'd an Hundred silly Jests upon me, and dash'd me so out of
Countenance, that <hi>Verville</hi> pity'd me. He took me away
from his unmannerly Brother, and carried me to
the<note n="*" place="margin">Place to take the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

                     </note> 
                     <hi>Course,</hi> where I was extremely Melancholy,
though <hi>Verville,</hi> out of a Kindness extraordinary
in a Person of his Age, and so much above me
by his Quality, us'd all possible Means to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
me. In the mean time the ill-natur'd Saint <hi>Far,</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
to satisfie himself, or rather to ruin me. He went strait
to Madam <hi>la Boissiere;</hi> where they took him at first for me,
because he had my Landlord's Servant with him, who had often
accompanied me thither; but had it not been for that, I believe
he had never been admitted. Madam <hi>la Boissiere</hi> was very
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:53808:34"/>
much surpriz'd to see a Man she did not know: She told Saint
<hi>Far,</hi> she could not imagine upon what score, a Stranger did
her the Honour of a Visit. Saint <hi>Far</hi> reply'd very Humbly, that
he was the Master of a young Fellow, who was so happy as to
be Wounded in her Service.</p>
                  <p>Having begun his Compliment with an account which, as I
was inform'd since, pleas'd neither the Mother nor the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
and these two Ingenuous Persons, being unwilling to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
the Reputation of their Wit, with a Man who at
first dash shew'd he had so little, the rude Impertinent was
little diverred with them, and they very much tir'd with him.
But what made him almost Mad, was his being deny'd the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
to see <hi>Leonora</hi>'s Face, though he begg'd her a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
times to draw the Vail she commonly wore, as all unmar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed
Ladies do at <hi>Rome.</hi> At last this accomplisht Courtier being
tired with tiring of 'em, rid 'em of his troublesom Visit, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
to Seignior <hi>Stephano</hi>'s with little Advantage from the ill
Office he had done me. Ever since that time, as 'tis ordinary
with illnatur'd People to hate those whom they have Injur'd, he
despis'd me to that Degree, and Disoblig'd me so often, that I
had a hundred times forgot the Respect I ow'd to his Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
if <hi>Verville</hi> by his constant Friendship, and repeated Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,
had not made me amends for his Brother's Brutality. I
was not yet acquainted with the ill Office he had done me, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
I often felt the effects of it; I found indeed, Madam <hi>La Boissiere</hi>
more reserv'd to me, than when we were first acquainted, but
being still as civil as before, I did not take notice of my being
Troublesom. As for <hi>Leonora,</hi> she appear'd very thoughtful be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
her Mother, but when she was not observ'd by her, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought
she was not so Melancholy, and cast on me more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
Looks. <hi>Destiny</hi> was thus relating his story, and the
Actresses listned very attentively, without shewing the least in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
to sleep, when they heard the Clock strike two; (<hi>in
the Morning</hi>) Mistress <hi>Cave</hi> put <hi>Destiny</hi> in mind, that the next
day he was to accompany Monsieur <hi>La Rappiniere</hi> to a House
about two or three Leagues out of Town, where he promis'd to
give 'em the Diversion of Hunting. This made <hi>Destiny</hi> take
his leave of the Players, and retire to his own Chamber, where
in all probability he went to Bed: The Players did the same,
and the remaining part of the Night was spent in quiet; the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <head type="sub">How the Curate of Domfront was carried away.</head>
                  <p>THose who have had so much spare time to throw away upon
the reading of the foregoing Chapters, may remember, if
they have not forgot it, that the Curate of <hi>Domfront</hi> was in one
of those Litters, which met four in Company in a little Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage,
by an Accident which perhaps had never happen'd before;
thô every one knows, four Litters may sooner meet together,
than four Mountains. This Curate then, who lodg'd in the
same Inn where our Players quarter'd, having held a Consulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Physicians of <hi>Mans</hi> about his Disease, and being told
by those grave Doctors in very Elegant <hi>Latin,</hi> that he was trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
with the Gravel, which the poor Man knew but too well
already; and likewise having dispatched some Business which
never came to my knowledge; This good Priest, I say, set out
from that Inn about nine a Clock in the Morning, to return to
the Spiritual Conduct of his Flock. One of his Nieces, drest
like a Gentlewoman, whether she was so or no, plac'd her self
on the fore-part of the Litter, at the good Man's Feet, who was
very thick and short. A Peasant, by Name <hi>William,</hi> led the
Fore-horse by the Bridle, by special, order from the Curate, for
fear the Horse should stumble; and the Curate's Servant, Nam'd
<hi>Iulian,</hi> took care to drive the hinder Horse, which was so
restive, that <hi>Iulian</hi> was often oblig'd to push him forward with
his Shoulders. The Curate's Chamber-pot, which was of yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
Brass, and glister'd like Gold, as being newly scowr'd in
the Inn, hung on the right side of the Litter, which made it
look more Magnificent than the left side, which was only adorn'd
with a Hat in a Pastboard Case, which the Curate receiv'd from
the <hi>Paris</hi> Messenger, for a Gentleman of his Acquaintance, who
had a House near <hi>Domfront.</hi> About a League and a half from
the Town, the Litter jogg'd leisurely on in a hollow way, fenced
on both sides with thick Hedges, as strong as Walls, when three
Horsemen seconded by two Men on Foot, stopt the Venerable
Litter. One of them who seem'd to be the Captain of those
Highway-men, with a most terrible Voice, said: Death and
Furies, the first Man that offers to speak a word, i'll Pistol him,
and clapt the Muzle of his Pistol within two Inches of <hi>William,</hi>
the Country-Fellow's Nose, who led the Horse-Litter. Another
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:53808:35"/>
did the like to <hi>Iulian,</hi> and one of the Foot-Pads levell'd his
Gun at the Curates Neck, whilst the Curate slept very quietly
in his Litter; and by that means was freed from the terrible
Fright which seiz'd his little peaceful Retinue. These Villanous
Fellows drove the Litter with more hast than the dull Horses
that carryed it, were willing to make. Never was silence bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
observ'd, in so violent an Action: The Curate's Niece was
more dead than alive; <hi>William</hi> and <hi>Iulian</hi> wept, without da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
so much as to open their Mouths, by reason of the terrible
Apparition of Fire-arms, and the Curate slept on, as I said
before. One of the Horsemen detach'd himself from the Main-Body,
and went a full Gallop before. In the mean time the
Litter reach'd a Wood, at the entrance of which, the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horse
which perhaps was as much frighted as his Leaders, or else
out of spite, because they forc'd him to go a quicker pace, than
his dull and heavy Constitution would permit him, put his Foot
in a Wheel-tract, and fell floundring so fiercely, that the Curate
wak'd at the Noise; and his Niece trundled down from the
Litter, on the lean Buttocks of the Jade. The good Man call'd
<hi>Iulian,</hi> who durst not so much as answer him; he then call'd
his Niece, who was not such a Fool as to open her Mouth; and
the Peasant being as hard-hearted as the rest, the Curate fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a Passion in good earnest. Some relate he swore a great Oath,
but I can hardly believe such a thing of a Curate of Lower <hi>Mayne.</hi>
The Curate's Niece had by this time rais'd her self up again
from the Horses Buttocks, and sat in her place without daring
to look on her Uncle, and the Horse having with great vigour
disingag'd his Feet, went on faster than ever he did, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the Curate's screaming out, with his Reading-desks
Voice, stop, stop. His repeated cries scar'd the Horses, who run
as if the Devil drove 'em, which made the Curate cry still the lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
Sometimes he call'd <hi>Iulian,</hi> sometimes <hi>William,</hi> and oftner than
the rest his Niece, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o whose Name he added the Epithet of double
Whore and Carion. However, she might have spoke if she had
been willing; for the Man who made her observe a religious Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
was gone to meet the Horsemen who rode before, about
forty or fifty yards from the Litter. But the fear of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine,
made her insensible of her Uncle's hard Words, who see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himself so obstinately disobey'd, began at last to howl' and
cry out, help, help, Murder. Thereupon the Horsemen who
rode before, and whom the Foot-man had call'd back, came to
the Litter, and made it stop. One of them said with a terrible
Voice to <hi>William?</hi> What Foolis that, that makes such a noise
in the Litter. Alas, Sir, answer'd <hi>William,</hi> with fear and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling,
you know it better than my self. The Horseman gave
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:53808:36"/>
him a found knock on the Teeth with the but end of his Pistol,
and presenting the Muzzle to the Niece, commanded her to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mask,
and tell him who she was. The Curate, who from his
Litter beheld all these Passages, and had a Law-suit with a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
in his Neighbourhood, <hi>De Laune</hi> by Name, thought
'twas he that had a mind to Murder him. Whereupon he cry'd
out; Monsieur <hi>de Laune,</hi> I Summon you before God Almighty,
to answer for my Murder if you kill me: I am a Consecrated
Priest, though an unworthy one, and i'll have you Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated
like a <hi>Cannibal.</hi> In the mean time his Niece pull'd off
her Mask, and shew'd to the Horseman a wild staring Face, which
he did not know. This produc'd an unexpected effect. That
passionate Gentleman discharg'd one of his Pistols into the Flank
of the Horse that carried the Fore-part of the Litter, and with
the other shot, one of his Footmen in the Head; saying, let all
that give false Intelligence, have this for their pains. And now
it was, that the Curate's and his Retinues fears began to redou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
He demanded their Confession, <hi>Iulian</hi> and <hi>William</hi> fell on
their Knees, and the Curate's Neece kept close to her Uncle,
But those who put them in that terrible Fright, were already
gone from 'em, and made the best of their way, as fast as their
Horses could drive, leaving to their Charge, the Body of the
Fellow that was shot with a Pistol. <hi>Iulian</hi> and <hi>William</hi> got up,
still shaking with the remains of their Fear, and told the Curate
and his Neece, that the Troopers were gone. Now they were
fain to unharnes the hindermost Horse, to set the Litter up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right;
and <hi>William</hi> was sent to the next Town to get another
Horse. In the mean time the Curate was at a loss, what to think
of these Accidents: He could not imagine, why they left him
without robbing him; nor for what reason, that Horseman kill'd
one of his own Men; at which, however, the Curate was not
so much offended, as at the loss of his poor murder'd Horse,
which in all probability, had never quarrel'd with that Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.
Upon the whole Matter, he concluded that 'twas <hi>de Laune,</hi>
who design'd to Murder him, and said, he'd have his Revenge,
His Neece maintain'd, that 'twas not <hi>de Laune,</hi> whom she knew
very well; but the Curate had a mind it should be he, that he
might have the occasion to indite him for an Assault, hoping to
get him Condemned upon the Deposition of some Knights of the
Post, whom he expected to find at <hi>G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ron,</hi> where he had some
Relations. <hi>Iulian</hi> espying a Company of Men on Horseback
making towards 'em, betook himself to his Heels as fast as he
could run: The Curate's Neece seeing <hi>Iulian</hi> upon the Flight,
thought he had some reason for it, and scamper'd away also
which put the Curate entirely beside himself, not knowing what
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:53808:36"/>
to make of so many extraordinary Accidents. At last he espy'd
Horsemen, whom <hi>Iulian</hi> saw before, and which is worse, he
saw 'em coming up directly towards him. This Troop was
composed of nine or ten Horsemen, in the midst of whom there
was a Wretch bound Hand and Foot on a little sorry Horse,
with a pale downcast Look, like one that's carried to be hang'd.
The Curate began to say his Prayers, recommending himself to
God Almighty's Mercy, not forgetting the Horse that was left
alive: But he was very much Surpriz'd, and Comforted the same
time, finding 'twas <hi>La Rappiniere</hi> with some of his Men. <hi>La
Rappiniere</hi> ask'd him what he did there, and whether 'twas he
that kill'd the Man that lay dead near the Horses side. The
Curate told him the whole Adventure, still affirming, that 'twas
<hi>de Laune</hi> that had Way-laid him, of which <hi>La Rappiniere</hi> made
a Verbal Process at large. One of his Guard went to the next
Village, to get the dead Body remov'd, and return'd with the
Curate's Neece and <hi>Iulian,</hi> who by this time were recover'd
from their Fright, and had met <hi>William</hi> with a fresh Horse for
the Litter. The Curate return'd safe and sound to <hi>Domfront,</hi>
where as long as he lives, he will relate how he was set upon,
and carried away. The dead Horse was eaten up by the
Wolves, or Masty Dogs; the Body of the dead Man was
bury'd I know not where, and <hi>La Rappiniere, Destiny, Rancour,</hi>
and <hi>Olive, La Rappinierr</hi>'s Guard, and the Prisoner, went back
to <hi>Mans.</hi> This is the Success of <hi>La Rappiniere,</hi> and the Strollers
Hunting, who catch'r a Man instead of a Hare.</p>

A Continuation of the History of Destiny and
Star. A Serenade.</head>
                  <p>YOU may be pleas'd to remember, that by the foregoing
Chapter, one of those that set upon the Curate of <hi>Dom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front,</hi>
had lest his Campanions, and went full Gallop I know not
whether. Now as he was Spurring on a main in a deep and
narrow Way, he spy'd afar off some Men on Horseback, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
directly towards him, and would have wheeled about to
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:53808:37"/>
shun 'em, but turning too short, and with more hast than good
speed, his Horse started up so suddenly, that he fell down back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
and his Rider under him. <hi>La Rappiniere</hi> and his Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
observing this, thought it were very strange, that a Man
who came in such post hast towards 'em, should endeavour to
avoid them with the like Speed. It gave them therefore just
cause of Suspicion, especially to <hi>La Rappiniere,</hi> who was very
Susceptible of his own Nature; besides, that his Office ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
him to make the worst Interpretation of things in dubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Cases. His Suspicion encreas'd to a high Degree, when
coming near that Man, who had one Leg engag'd under his
Horse, he took notice that he was not so much dismaid at his
Fall, as that it was with such a Witness: Now considering it
could be no prejudice to him to aggravate his Fright, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
how to discharge his Office, as well as any Provost in <hi>France,</hi>
he drew near him, and told him; What! are you caught in a
Trap, good, honest Man: Well, I'll take care you do not get
such another heavy Fall. This amaz'd the poor Fellow much
more than his Fall had done, and <hi>La Rappiniere</hi> and his Harpies
saw in his Countenance such visible Signs of a gulity Conscience,
that any other Provost less forward than he, would have arrested
him without any more a doc. He therefore commanded his Men to
help to get him up, and bound Hand and Foot on his own Horse,
He soon afterwards met the Curate of <hi>Domfront</hi> in that Disorder
you have read of, with a dead Person Murther'd, and a Horse
shot thorough, which confirm'd him in his Suspicions; to which
the Prisoner's greater Disorder and change of Colour, was no small
Addition. <hi>Destiny</hi> survey'd him more earnestly than the rest, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining
he knew him, though where he had seen him, he could not
perfectly call to mind. He scratch'd his dull Pate all the way
he rode, to awake his drowsie Memory; yet could not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
where he had seen him. At length they Arriv'd at <hi>Mans,</hi>
where <hi>La Rippiniere</hi> committed the suppos'd Malefactor to Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
whilst the Strollers who were to open the stage the day fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing,
retir'd to their Inn, to get all things in readiness. They
were reconcil'd to the Inn-keeper, and the Poet who was as
generous as any Poet of 'em all, would needs Treat 'em at
Supper. <hi>Ragotin</hi> who was then in the Inn, and could not refrain
coming to it, ever since he was smitten with Madam <hi>Star,</hi> was
invited by the Poet, who was so much a Fool, as to invite also
those that had been Spectators of the Combate, which was fought
the Night before betwixt the Players and the Inn-keepers Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
in their Shirts and Smocks. A little before Supper begun,
the jolly Company was further incens'd by the Arrival of an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perator,
and his Retinue; which consisted of his Wife, an old
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:53808:37"/>
Blackamore Maid, a Monkey, and two FootMen. <hi>Rancour</hi> was
of his Acquaintance, of a long standing, and therefore there
past great Civility betwixt 'em: Nor would the Poet, who was
easily acquainted with the People, part with him nor his Wife,
before he had prevail'd upon 'em by his high Compliments,
which sounded loud, and signified little, only to come and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
him with his Presence at Supper. Well, Sup they did,
where nothing happen'd that is Remarkable, only they drank
plentifully, and eat in proportion. <hi>Ragotin'</hi> fed his Eyes on Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
<hi>Star</hi>'s Face, which intoxicated him more than the Liquor
he swallow'd. He spoke but very sparingly all the time they
were at Table, thô the Poet gave him a fair Opportunity of
Wrangling, flatly Condemning <hi>Theophilus</hi>'s Verses, of which
<hi>Ragotin</hi> was a great Admirer. The <hi>She-</hi> Players engag'd a while
with the Operator's Wife, a <hi>Spanish</hi> Woman, pretty agreeable.
They afterwards withdrew to their Chamber, whither <hi>Destiny</hi>
waited on 'em, to prosecute and end his story, which <hi>Cave</hi> and
her Daughter died with Impatience to hear. <hi>Star</hi> in the mean
time was studying her Part, and <hi>Destiny</hi> having taken a Chair
near the Bed-side, whereon <hi>Cave</hi> and her Daughter sat, went
on with his story after this manner.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto you have found me very Amorous, and much in pain,
to know what effect my Letter had wrought in <hi>Leonora</hi>'s and
her Mother's Mind's; you shall see me more in Love yet,
and in the greatest Despair imaginable. I waited every day on
Madam <hi>La Boissiere</hi> and her Daughter, so blinded with my Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
that I did not take notice of the coldness of their Recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
nor did I consider that my too frequent Visits would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
importunate. Madam <hi>La Boissiere</hi> was weary of my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
ever since Saint <hi>Far</hi> acquainted <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> who I was: Yet she
could not civilly forbid me the House, after what I had suffer'd on
her account. As for her Daughter, if I may judge by what
she has done since, I may say she pitied me, thô contrary to her
Mother's Will, who kept so watchful an Eye upon her, that
we could never have an Opportunity to meet in private. But
to speak the Truth, thô this fair Virgin would have been less
cold to me than her Mother, she durst not shew me the least to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of her Favour before her Mother; so that I was on the
Rack, and thy assiduous Visits, serv'd only to make me more
hateful to those whom I design'd to please. One day Madam
<hi>de la Boissiere</hi> having receiv'd some Letters from <hi>France,</hi>
which
oblig'd her to go abroad as soon as she had read the Contents of
'em, she sent immediately for a Coach, and Signior <hi>Stephano</hi>
accompany her, not daring to go alone after the unlucky Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter,
wherein I was engaged upon her account. I was my
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:53808:38"/>
self nearer at hand, and more fit to be her Squire than the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
she sent for; but she would not accept of the least Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
from a Person, whom she intended to rid her self of. As
luck would have it, <hi>Stephano</hi> was not to be found; so that she
was compell'd to shew before me, how uneasie she was, that she
had no Body to go along with her, that I might offer my self;
which I did with as much Joy, as she could have Regret to be
necessitated to take me along with her. I Conducted her to a
certain Cardinal, who was then Protector of the <hi>French,</hi> who
by good fortune gave her Audience, upon the first Motion she
made. The Business was doubtless of great Importance, and
no small Difficulty; for she was a long time with him in a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Grotto, or cover'd Fountain in the midst of a fine Garden,
whilst all the Cardinal's Followers walked into those parts of
the Garden they had most fancy to. Now was I got into a
large Walk of Orange-Trees alone, with the Beautiful <hi>Leonora,</hi>
a Blessing I had often wish'd before in vain; and yet more Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
and Faint-hearted, than ever I had been. I cannot tell
whether she took notice of it or not, or whether it was her Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
which made her speak first to me in this manner. My Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
said she, will have just reason to quarrel with Signior <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phano</hi>
for failing us to day, and being the occasion of the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
we give you to wait here so long. And I am infinitely ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
to him, reply'd I, for procuring me, thô without Design, the
greatest Happiness I ever hope to enjoy. I am too far upon the
score of Obligation towards you, said the, to omit any thing that
may prove your Advantage; therefore, pray lot me know where
the Happiness consists you mention, as procur'd by him, that I
may share your Joy, if it be such as will not offend a Maiden's
Ear. I fear, said I, lest you make that Joy cease—I! an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd
she; No, I never was envious of any Man's Prosperity,
much less of a Person, who has ventur'd his Life on my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.
'Tis not your Envy that I fear, answer'd I,—What
other Motive, return'd she, can there be to make me oppose
your Felicity? Your Disdain, said I. I shall be much perplex'd,
added she, till you let me know what I should Disdain, and
which way this Disdain may concern you. I could soon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>old
this Riddle, said I, but I cannot tell whether you will be
pleas'd to understand it. Do not let me hear it then, reply'd
she; for when we have such Doubts, it shews the thing is not
to be easily understood, or is such as may Displease, I must
confess I have admir'd a hundred times since, how I was able
to answer her, my Mind being less intent upon what she said,
than full of Fears of her Mother's return, and losing the Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
of entertaining her with my Love. However, at last
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:53808:38"/>
I muster'd all my Assurance, and without prolonging a Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation,
which did not carry me fast enough to the Point I aim'd
at; I told her, without minding her last words; That I had
long sought the Opportunity to speak with her, thereby to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
what I had presum'd to express in my Letter, which yet I
durst not have undertaken, but on the knowledge that she had
seen that Writing. To this I added, a great deal of what I had
Written, and said Moreover, that being upon my Departure to
serve the Pope in the War he was making on some Princes of
<hi>Italy,</hi> and resolv'd to die there, since I found my self unworthy
to live for her; I would entreat her only to tell me, what Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents
she would have entertain'd for me, had my Fortune an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd
the Ambition I had to love her. She told me with a
Blush, that my Death would not be indifferent to her; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
added she, if you are still of the same obliging Temper
towards your Friends, do not let's loose one who has been so ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable
to us; or at least, if you will needs die, for some great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
reason than what you have just now express'd; yet defer
your Death, till we have seen one another in <hi>France,</hi> whither my
Mother and my self are suddenly returning. I press'd her to
explain more clearly the Sentiments she had for me, but her
Mother was by this time come so near us, that she could not
have satisfi'd me, if she had intended it. Madam <hi>de la Boissiere</hi>
look'd but coldly upon me, perhaps because I had had an Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to entertain her Daughter, who likewise seem'd to
be somwhat uneasie, which made me stay but a little while
with them, after their being return'd home. I left 'em highly
pleas'd with my Adventure, putting the best Interpretation on
<hi>Leonora</hi>'s Answer, which I inferr'd to be favourable to my Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
The next day I omitted not to wait upon them according
to my Custom: I was told they were gone abroad, and the same
answer I receiv'd for three days together, for I was not Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courag'd
by the first or second Denial. In fine, Signior <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phano</hi>
advis'd me to go no more, because Madam' <hi>de la Boissiere</hi>
would not suffer me to see her Daughter; adding, he took me
to be a Man of more Sense, than to Expose my self to a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusal.
Then he acquainted me with the reason of my Disgrace.
<hi>Leonora</hi>'s Mother had caught her writing a Letter to me, and
having severely Reprov'd her for it, did afterwards give a strict
Order, that her People should always deny their being within,
when I came to pay my Visit to 'em: And then I likewise dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd
the ill Office Saint <hi>Far</hi> had done me, and that ever since
that time, the Mother had been very much displeas'd with my
Visits. As for the Daughter, <hi>Stephano</hi> assur'd me, that my
Personal Merit would have made her wave my mean Birth and
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:53808:39"/>
Fortune, could she have gain'd her Mother's Consent; who was
too Haughty and Covetous to be perswaded to it. I shall not
trouble you with the desperate Thoughts this unwelcome News
put me into: I was as much concern'd at it, as if I had Injustice
done, in being refus'd by <hi>Leonora,</hi> thô I never durst hope to have
the least possession in her Heart: I rail'd against Saint <hi>Far,</hi> and
had some thoughts of Fighting him; but then considering how
much I was oblig'd to his Father and Brother, I had no other
Refuge but my Tears. I wept like a Child, and was always
uneasie, but most of all in Company. Now came the sad
moment of our Departure, and I was forc'd to go away with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
taking my last Farewell of <hi>Leonora.</hi> We made a Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign
in the Pope's Armies, where I courted Death as much as
I could; but Fortune disappointed me in this, as she had e're done
in all my other Attempts. I could not meet with Death which
I sought for, but gain'd Reputation I did not aim at, thô I had
been proud of it at any other time; whereas then I could che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
nothing, but the pleasing remembrance of <hi>Leonora. Verville</hi>
and Saint <hi>Far</hi> were recall'd to <hi>France</hi> by the Baron <hi>d'Arques,</hi>
who
receiv'd 'em like a Father, who dotes on his Children. My Mother
gave me a very indifferent Reception; and as for my Father, he
dwelt at <hi>Paris</hi> with Count <hi>Glaris,</hi> who had chosen him Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
to his Son. The Baron <hi>d'Arques,</hi> who was made acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with my feats of Arms in the War of <hi>Italy,</hi> where I had
sav'd <hi>Verville</hi>'s Life, would needs have me live with him in Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of a Gentleman, and Companion. He gave me leave to
visit my Father at <hi>Paris,</hi> where I found less welcome, than I
had done from my Mother. Any other Person in his Station,
that had had a Son so Accomplish'd as my self would certainly
have presented him to the <hi>Scotch</hi> Earl, but my Father carried
me out of his House in great hast, as if he fear'd I should Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
him: As we went about the Streets, he Reproach'd my
being too fine and gallant; told me, I seem'd proud, and that
'twere better for me to learn a Trade, than thus to strut it with
a Sword on my side. you may imagine, this Discourse sounded
but harsh in a young Man's Ears, that had been well Educated,
and gain'd some Reputation in the Wars. And who besides had
dared to love a handsom young Lady, and declare his Passion
to her. I must freely own, that the Sentiments of Love and
Respect, which a Son own to his Father, could not make me
refrain from looking on him as a very Troublesom old Man.
He led me about through three or four several Streets, with the
same Civility and Caressing Expressions, and then shook me off
Abruptly, charging me not to come near him any more. I was
willing enough to obey this last Injunction, and therefore quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:53808:39"/>
him, to go and wait upon Monsieur <hi>de Saint Sauvour,</hi> who
receiv'd me like a Father indeed, and blam'd my own Parents
for their unnaturalness; promising withal, never to abandon
me. The Baron <hi>d'Arques</hi> had some Business, which oblig'd him
to go and dwell at <hi>Paris.</hi> He took his Lodgings the further end
of Saint <hi>Germains</hi> Suburb, in a very stately House, that had
been lately built with many others, which have rendred that
Suburb the finest part of the City of <hi>Paris.</hi> Saint <hi>Far</hi> and
<hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville</hi>
made their Court to the King, went to the
<note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>At the</hi> Ring <hi>in</hi> Hide-Park.</note> 
                     <hi>Park,</hi> or a Visiting, as all young Men of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
are wont to do in that vast City, which
makes the Inhabitants of all other Cities in the Kingdom that
never come there, be accounted Clowns. For my own part,
when I waited not on them, I frequented all the Fencing-Schools
to keep my hand in use, or went to the Play-House, which is
perhaps one reason why I am now a tolerable Actor. <hi>Verville</hi>
took me aside one day, and told me he was fallen deeply in
Love with a young Lady that dwelt in the same Street. He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
me she had a Brother, <hi>Saldagne</hi> by Name, who was as
jealous both of her, and another Sister under his Tuition, as
if he had been their Husband. Moreover he told me, he had
made no small progress in his Amours, having persuaded her
to give him Entrance by Night into their Garden, the back
Door whereof open'd into the Fields, as ours did likewise. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
made me his Confident, he desir'd me to Accompany him,
and use all my Rhetorick to gain the Favour of the Woman that
was to attend her. <hi>Verville</hi> had shew'd me all along such Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
that I could not reasonably refuse him any thing: So we
went out of our Garden Back-door about ten a Clock at Night,
and were admitted into the Garden where the Mistress and
the Maid waited for us. The poor Madam <hi>Saldagne</hi> trembled
like a Leaf, and durst not speak; <hi>Verville</hi>'s Courage was little
better; the Waiting-woman was as mute as she; and I who
only came to Accompany <hi>Verville,</hi> spoke not a Word, neither
had I any desire of prating. At last <hi>Verville</hi> summon'd his
Courage to his Aid, and led his Mistress into a close Walk, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
first laid a strict Charge upon the Waiting-woman and my
self to play the Centeries part, which we observ'd so Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously,
that for a long time we walk'd together, without speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
one word to one another. At the end of the Ally we met
with the young pair of Lovers: <hi>Verville</hi> ask'd me aloud, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I had entertain'd Mistress <hi>Maudlin</hi> as she deserv'd? I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd,
I thought she had no reason to Complain. No, in truth,
answer'd <hi>Abigal,</hi> for he has not yet spoke one word to me. <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville</hi>
laugh'd at her words, and assur'd Mistress <hi>Maudlin,</hi> that
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:53808:40"/>
I was worth her Conversation, though I were somwhat Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy.
Likewise Madam <hi>Saldagne</hi> said, that her Woman was
not to be Despis'd, and thereupon those happy Lovers left us
again, only bidding us be sure that no Body came to Surprize
'em I then prepar'd my self to be plagued with the Chat of a
Waiting-woman, whom I expected would now examine me about
my Wages, what Acquaintance I had among the Chamber-Maids
in that Parish, how many new Catches I could sing, and what Vails
I had with my Master. After this, I imagin'd she would acquaint
me with all the Secrets of <hi>Saldagne</hi>'s Family, and tell me both his
Faults, and his Sisters. For there are few Servants that meet, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
giving one another a full Account of all they know about their
Masters and Mistresses, and finding fault with 'em for neglecting
to make their own Fortune, and prefer their Servants. But I
was not a little Surpriz'd, to find my self in Discourse with a
Waiting-woman, that began thus: I Conjure thee, thou Dumb
Spirit, to tell me whether thou art a Serving-Man, or not, and
if thou art a Serving-Man, by what admirable Virtue thou hast
forborn, thus long slandering thy Master? I was amaz'd to
hear a Chamber-Maid talk at that extraordinary Rate; and so
I ask'd her, by what Authority she took upon her to Exorcise
me? I perceive, said she, thou art a stubborn Spirit, and
that I must repeat my Conjuration. Tell me therefore, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious
Spirit, by the Power God has given me over all proud
and self-conceited Serving-Men, tell me who thou art. I am a
poor young fellow, answer'd I, that would fain be now asleep
in my Bed. I find, reply'd she, it will be no easie Matter for
me to know who thou art: Yet thus much I clearly discover
already, that thou hast little of a Courtier in thee. For, continued
she, should'st thou not have first broken Silence in an humble
Address; then have taken me by the Hand, entertain'd me with
abundance of Amorous fiddle-faddle, suddenly strugl'd for a Kiss,
attempted to storm my Breast, till you had been beaten off with
three or four Cuffs on the Ear, as many Kicks on the Breech,
and Scratches over the Nose; and then have return'd home
with Scars of Honour, and the Marks of an Amorous Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turer?
There are some Maids in <hi>Paris,</hi> said I, interrupting her,
whose marks I would be proud to bear; but there are others
too, whom I shall dread to look upon, for fear of Dreaming
afterwards of the Devil. What? thou thinkest, said she, that I am
perhaps one of those Scare-crows. But good Master <hi>Squeamish,</hi>
dost thou not remember the old saying, <hi>That in the Dark all
Cats are Grey!</hi> True, reply'd I, but I'll never do that in the Dark
which I may repent when the light appears. But if I be hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som,
said she, what then? Then I have shew'd you less respect
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:53808:40"/>
than you deserve, reply'd I: For if your Beauty be equal to the
Charms of your Wit, you deserve to be serv'd and courted after
the nicest Rules of Gallantry. And couldst thou serve a Lady
according to the nicest Rules, said she? Better than any Man li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
replied I, provided I lov'd her. What's matter for that,
said she, so she lov'd you? Nay, both must joyn Issue, where I
engage in an Amour, replied I. Truly, said she, if I may judge
of the Master by his Man, then has my Mistress made no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
Choice in Monsieur <hi>Verville;</hi> and that Waiting-Maid,
whom thou shouldst condescend to love, would have no little
Cause to be proud of her self. 'Tis not enough to hear me
talk, said I, you must see me too—I believe both may be
better let alone, replied she—Our Conversation was fain to end
here: for Monsieur <hi>Saldagne</hi> knockt hard at the Street Door,
which they made no great haste to open, that his Sister might
have time to slip up into her Chamber. The poor Lady and her
Woman went away in such haste and disorder, that they did not
so much as bid us adieu when they shut us out to the Garden.
<hi>Verville</hi> would needs have me go into his Chamber, when we
got home. I never saw a Man so much in Love, and so well
pleas'd: He extoll'd the Wit of his Mistress, and told me, he
should never be satisfied till I had seen her. In fine, he kept me
there all Night, repeating every thing over and over so often,
that I could not get to my Bed till break of Day. For my own
part I admired to have met with so much Wit in the Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a Waiting-Woman; and I must confess, I had a sort of
an itching Desire to know whether she was Handsom or not, tho,
the Memory of my <hi>Leonora</hi> made me very indifferent towards
all the good Faces I saw every Day in <hi>Paris. Verville</hi> and I
slept till it was Noon: and as soon as he wak'd, he wrote to
Madam <hi>Saldagne,</hi> and sent the Letter by his Footman, who had
several others, and was acquainted with her Woman. This Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
was of <hi>Lower Britany,</hi> of a very disagreeable Figure, and
a worse Brain. When I saw him going, it came into my
Thoughts, that if the Party, whether Waiting-Woman, or Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber-maid,
whom I had entertain'd, should see him in that rugged
Shape, and speak with him a while, that certainly she would
not mistake him for the Person that waited on <hi>Verville.</hi> This
great Looby did his Message well enough for a looby; having
found Madam <hi>Saldagne</hi> with her other Sister, nam'd Madam
<hi>Lery,</hi> whom she had entrusted with <hi>Vervilie</hi>'s Love to her. As
he was waiting for an Answer, they heard Monsieur <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dagne</hi>
singing on the Stairs. He was coming to his Sister's Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
who hastily convey'd the <hi>British Mercury</hi> into a Press for
Clothes. However the Brother made no long stay with his
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:53808:41"/>
Sister, and so the <hi>Britan</hi> was set in the open Air. Madam <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dagne</hi>
lock'd her self up in her Closet a while to answer <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville</hi>'s
Letter, and Madam <hi>Lery</hi> discours'd the <hi>Britan,</hi> whose
Conversation, I doubt, was not very entertaining. Her Sister,
having made an end of her Letter, releas'd her from our Clown,
sending him back with a Billet, wherein she promis'd to meet
him that Night, at the same Time and Place as before. As
soon as it was Night, you may imagine, that <hi>Verville</hi> was ready
to go to the Place of Assignation, We were admitted into the
Garden, and it fell to my Lot to cope with the same Person I
entertain'd before, and whom I found so very witty. She ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd
more Wit this second time than she had done at first;
and both her Accent and manner of Speech was so charming, that I
confess I wish'd she might be as Handsom as she was Ingenious. In
the mean time she could not believe me to be the <hi>Britan</hi> she had
seen before; nor could she apprehend why I should have so much
more Wit by Night than by Day: for having heard the Fellow
relate that Monsieur <hi>Saldagne</hi>'s coming into his Sister's Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
had put him into a great Fright, I took it upon my self, and
plaid upon her with it, assuring her, that I was not then in so
much fear for my self, as for Madam <hi>Saldagne.</hi> This put it
out of all Dispute that I was the same ill-favour'd R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>gue; and
I observ'd afterwards she began indeed to discourse like a
Chamber-maid, She then inform'd me, that Monsieur <hi>Saldagne</hi>
was a terrible Man; that having lost both Father and Mother
in his Youth, being Master of a great Estate, and having only
few of his Kindred, he exercis'd a great deal of Tyranny over
his Sisters, to make them turn Nuns; using them not only like
an unjust Father, but like a jealous unsupportable Husband. I
was about to take my turn, and tell a Story of the Baron <hi>d'Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques</hi>
and his Sons, when the Garden-Door, which we had not
made fast, was thrown open, and in comes Monsieur <hi>Saldagne,</hi>
attended by two Footmen, the one carrying a lighted Flamboy
in his Hand. He came from a House which stood in the same
Row with his and ours, where they gamed every Day, and
which Saint <hi>Far</hi> frequented to pass away the time. They had
both plaid there that Evening, and <hi>Saldagne</hi> having soon lost his
Money, was coming home by his Garden, contrary to his Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom,
and there surpriz'd us as I told you, finding the Door o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen.
We were at that time all four of us together in a cover'd
Walk, which gave us opportunity to shun his and his Mens View
The Gentlewoman remain'd in the Garden, upon pretence of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
king the fresh Air; and to give it the better Colour, began to sing
though she had little Inclination to it, as you may easily ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine.
In the mean time <hi>Verville</hi> having scall'd the Wall, by mean
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:53808:41"/>
of a Vine-Arbour, jump'd down on the other side. But a third
Footman of <hi>Saldagne</hi>'s that was but coming in, seeing him
leap, fail'd not to run and give his Master notice he had seen a
Man leap from the Garden-Wall into the Street. At the same
instant I fell down with a great noise into the Garden, the same
Arbour, by means of which, <hi>Verville</hi> made his escape, being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunately
broke down under me. This Noise, together with
the Fellow's Tale, alarm'd all those that were in the Garden:
<hi>Saldagne</hi> runs to the Place from whence the Noise came, Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
by his three Men, and spying a Man with his Sword
drawn, (for as soon as I could get up I put my self in a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture
of defence,) he attack'd me at the Head of his Company;
but I soon made him know I was no easie Conquest. The
Fellow that carried the Flamboy advanc'd farther than the rest,
which gave me opportunity to see <hi>Saldagne</hi>'s Face, whom I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
knew to be the same <hi>Frenchman</hi> that would have murder'd
me at <hi>Rome,</hi> for having hindred him from being rude to <hi>Leono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi>
as I before related. He knew me likewise at first sight, and
making no doubt but I was come thither to take my just Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,
he cry'd out, You shall not escape me now I assure you:
And then I was hard put to it indeed; besides that I had almost
broken one of my Legs with my Fall. I maintain'd a running
Fight, till I retreated into a Summer-house, whither I saw <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville</hi>'s
Mistress run in before in a woful Condition. She staid
within it, though she saw me enter, whether she wanted time
or Courage to go out, I know not. For my part, my Resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
encreas'd, when I consider'd they could attack me only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
at the Summer-House-Door, which was very narrow. I
wounded <hi>Saldagne</hi> in one of his Hands, and the boldest of his
Footmen in his Arm, which procur'd me a little Respite; yet
could I not have any Hopes of escaping, believing they would
at last make shorter work with me, and dispatch me with Pistols,
having found it too difficult to be done with Swords. But <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville</hi>
came to my Relief: He would by no means go Home with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
me; and having heard the Bustle and clashing of Swords,
he ventur'd to bring me off from the Danger he cast me into, or
at least to share it with me. <hi>Saldagne,</hi> with whom he had already
made an Acquaintane, thought he came to his Aid, as a Friend
and Neighbour. He took it as a great Obligation, and accost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him, said: You see, Sir, how I am set upon in my own
House. <hi>Verville,</hi> who understood his meaning, immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd;
He would be his Servant against any other Man, but
that he came to protect this one against all the World. <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dagne</hi>
enrag'd to find himself mistaken, swore desperately, he
did not doubt to make his Party good against two such Traytors
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:53808:42"/>
himself; and at the same time charg'd <hi>Verville</hi> most furiously,
but was repuls'd by him with a great deal of Gallantry. Then I
thought it high time to get out of my Summer-house to joyn
with my Friend, and surprizing the Lacquey that carried the
Flamboy, I was loath to kill him, and contented my self to give
him a back-stroke over the Pate, which put him into such a
Fright, that he ran off from the Garden into the Fields, crying
out, Thieves, Thieves. The other Footmen fled likewise; and
as for <hi>Saldagne,</hi> I saw him fall in a Hedge at the same instant
that the Light left us, either wounded by <hi>Verville</hi> or by some
other Accident. We did not think it fit to help him to get up,
but minded our own escape with all the haste we could. <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dagne</hi>'s
Sistor, fearing some Violence from her rash Brother,
stept to us out of the Summer-house, where I saw her, and
begg'd of us softly, and melting into Tears, that we would take
her along with us. <hi>Verville</hi> was over-joy'd to have his Mistress
in his own Power, under his Protection. We found our Garden-Door
half-open as we left it; nor would we make it fast as
yet, lest we should have a new Occasion to go out again on the
sudden. There was in our Garden a pretty Summer-house,
painted, and nearly adorn'd, where they did eat in hot Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and which stood at some distance from the Body of the
House. My young Masters and my self did sometimes practise
our Fencing there, and this being the most delightful Place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the House, the Baron <hi>d'Arques,</hi> his Sons, and my self, had
each of us a Key, that we might go in at pleasure, and keep
out the Servants, lest they should make havock of the Books and
the Goods that were there. In this place we lock'd up our Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman,
whose Grief would receive no Comfort. I told her
we would only leave her a few Moments to consult her Safety
and our own, and then return immediately to her. <hi>Verville</hi> was
a quarter of an Hour before he could wake his <hi>British</hi> Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
who had been fudling himself. As soon as he had got a
Candle lighted, we consulted a while where we should bestow
<hi>Saldagne</hi>'s Sister, and resolv'd at last to lead her to my Chamber, in
the upper part of the House, as being frequented by no Body
but my self and a Servant that belong'd to me. We return'd
back to the Summer-house in the Garden with our Light. <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville</hi>
gave a great Shriek at his going in, which very much
surpriz'd me: I had not the time to ask him what ail'd him, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
some Voices just at the Summer-house Door, when I put out
the Candle. <hi>Verville</hi> cry'd our, Who goes there? His Brother,
Saint <hi>Far,</hi> answer'd, 'Tis I, What the Devil do you do here in
the Dark at this time of Night? I was talking with <hi>Garigues,</hi>
said <hi>Verville,</hi> because I am not yet sleepy. I am here for the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:53808:42"/>
same Reason, return'd Saint <hi>Far;</hi> therefore pray let me have the
Room a little while to my self in my Turn. We did not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
him to ask twice; but I stealing out the Lady as dextrously
as I could, and thrusting my self betwixt her and Saint <hi>Far,</hi> who
went in at the same time, carried her away to my Chamber,
bemoaning her self at a desperate rate; and then I went down
to <hi>Verville</hi>'s Room, where his Man was striking a Light. <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville</hi>
then told me, with Grief in his Face, that he must of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
return again to <hi>Saldagne</hi>'s: And what will you do with
him, said I, kill him outright? Alas! my poor <hi>Garigues,</hi> said he, I
shall be the most unhappy Man in the World, if I do not get Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
<hi>Saldagne</hi> out of her Brother's Hands. What! can she be
there still, and in my Chamber too, reply'd I? Would to God
that were true, reply'd he, sighing, I fancy you dream; return'd
I, No, no, I do not dream; we have brought away her eldest Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
instead of her, said he; Why, reply'd I, were you not both in
the Garden together? Nothing more certain, said he; Why
then will you return to her Brother's to endanger your self afresh?
since that Sister you are in pain about is now safe in my Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.
Ha! <hi>Garigues,</hi> cries he again, I knew well enough what I
saw: And so do I likewise; and to prove your Mistake, do
but come up and see Madam <hi>Saldagne;</hi> He told me I was a Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
and follow'd me with the greatest Trouble in the World;
But my Astonishment equall'd his Grief, when I found in my Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
a Gentlewoman I never saw before, and not the same with
her I brought from the other House. <hi>Verville</hi> was as much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maz'd
as my self, but more satisfied by far, finding himself with
his Mistress, contrary to Expectation. He then consess'd his own
Mistake: But I could make him no Answer, neither was I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to comprehend by what Enchantment a Lady whom I had
followed all the while, should be transform'd to another, in the
time we went from the Summer-house to my Chamber. I look'd
earnestly upon <hi>Verville</hi>'s Mistress, who certainly was not the
same Person we brought from <hi>Saldagne</hi>'s. <hi>Verville</hi> perceiving
me in a Quandary; What's the Matter, says he? I tell you
once more, that I my self was mistaken. Nay, said I, 'tis I that am
in an Error, if Madam <hi>Saldagne</hi> came hither along with us. With
whom could she come else, reply'd he? I know not, nor no Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
else, said I, unless it be the Lady her self. Nor can I tell
with whom I came my self, said Madam <hi>Saldagne,</hi> unless it were
with that Gentleman, pointing to me: For, continued she, 'twas
not Monsieur <hi>Verville</hi> that brought me away from my Brother's;
'twas a Man that came into the Garden immediately after
you went out of it, summon'd there, either by my Brother's
Groans, or the Footmens Outcries, which alarm'd him, no
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:53808:43"/>
doubt, and gave him notice of what had pass'd. He caus'd
my Brother to be carried into his Chamber; and my Waiting-Woman
having inform'd me of all this, and assur'd me he was
of my Brother's Acquaintance, and a Neighbour; I went and
staid for him in the Garden, when I conjur'd him to take me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
with him till the next Day, when I design'd to retire to a
Lady of my Acquaintance, where I would stay till my Brother's
Fury was over; which, I told him, I had all the Reason in the
World to dread. This Person was so civil as to offer to conduct
me whither I would, and promis'd to protect me even against
my Brother, with the hazard of his Life. 'Twas under his
Conduct I came to this House, where <hi>Verville,</hi> whose Voice I
knew, spoke to the same Man; and immediately after I was
brought up to this Chamber, where you now see me. This
Account of Madam <hi>Saldagne,</hi> tho' it did not clear all my Doubts,
yet it help'd very much to make me guess how the Thing was
brought about. As for <hi>Vervile,</hi> he was so intent upon viewing
his Mistress, that he scarce minded what she said. He began to
tell her a Thousand sweet Things, without troubling himself to
know which way she came into my Chamber. I took a Candle,
and leaving them together, went back to the Summer-house in
the Garden resolving to speak with Saint <hi>Far,</hi> tho' he should be
as blunt and captious as he us'd to be. But I was not a little
surpriz'd to find, instead of him, the same Gentlewoman, whom
I was certain I brought my self from <hi>Saldagne</hi>'s: And what en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd
my Wonder was, to see her in great Disorder, like one
to whom some Violence had been offered; her Commode torn
off, and her Steenkirk bloody, as well as her Face. <hi>Verville,</hi>
said she to me as soon as I appear'd, approach me not, unless it
be to take away my Life, wherein you will find less Difficulty
than in offering Violence a second time to my Honour. And
as Heaven has given me Strength to resist your first Attempts, so I
doubt not but I shall be able to scratch thy Eyes out, if I cannot
be the Death of you. Is this, added she weeping, that passionate
Love you profess'd to my Sister? Oh! how dear I pay for
my Compliance with her Follies! But when we act contrary to
our Duty, it is but just we should undergo what we stand mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

in fear of. But what do you now meditate, pursued she? per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
my Astonishment; Do you feel a Remorse of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
for your base Action? If so, I can well forget it with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

our Family, not satisfied with seducing a young Lady, and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
a Gentleman, unless a more wicked Act compleat thy
Crime. Having made an end of her Speech, which she utter'd
with great vehemence, she fell a weeping so bitterly, that I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
saw one so afficted. This, I must confess, made me forfeit
all the little Judgment I was till then Master of, amidst so much
Confusion, and if she had not ceased of her own accord to speak,
I never should have interrupted her, so much was I astonish'd at
the Authority of her Expostulations. But perceiving she had done
speaking; Madam, replied I, neither am I <hi>Verville,</hi> nor is he, I
can assure you, capable of such a base Action as that you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
of What! said she, are you not <hi>Verville?</hi> Did not I see you
engag'd with my Brother? Did not a Gentleman come to your
Assistance? And did not you bring me hither on my Entreaty,
where you have offered a Rudeness impious both to my Honour
and Youth? She could say no more, so much her Grief oppress'd
her Heart. For my own part, I never was so much perplex'd,
and could not apprehend how she should both know <hi>Verville,</hi> and
not know him at the same time. I told her I was an absolute
Stranger to the Rudeness she complain'd of; and that since Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>Saldagne</hi> was her Brother, I would conduct her, if she pleas'd
to the same Place, where her Sister was. These Words were,
scarce out of my Mouth, when I spied <hi>Verville</hi> and Madam <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dagne</hi>
coming into the Room where we were, she being absolutely
resolv'd
to go back again to her Brother's; but how this dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Freak came into her Head I know not. The two Sisters
embrac'd each other as soon as they met, and renew'd their flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Tears, as if they were contending who should weep most.
<hi>Verville</hi> earnestly entreated them to return to my Chamber, lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
before them the Difficulty of getting into their House af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the great Alarm the whole Family was in; adding withal,
the Danger they run by exposing themselves to their Brother's
present Fury; the safety of the Place they were in, and how
near it was to break of Day; which being once come. they would
enquire how all things went at <hi>Saldagne</hi>'s, and accordingly they
might resolve what was most convenient to be done. <hi>Verville</hi> ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
persuaded them to condescend to this Proposition. Those
two Ladies finding now themselves secure in one another's
Presence. We went up to my Chamber; whete having ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin'd
the strange Accidents which perplex'd us, we were as
apt to believe, as if our Eyes had been Witness, that Saint <hi>Far</hi>
had certainly attempted upon Madam <hi>Lery</hi>'s Honour, <hi>Verville</hi>
and my self knowing him capable of the like and worse Actions.
We were not deceiv'd in our Conjectures. Saint <hi>Far</hi> had been
gaming in that very same House where <hi>Saldagne</hi> had lost his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
and passing by his Garden a little after the Scuffle was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:53808:44"/>
he met with <hi>Saldagne</hi>'s Footmen, who related to him what
had befallen his Master, whom they said had been set upon by
seven or eight Rogues, thereby to excuse their own Cowardise,
in leaving their Master in the Lurch. Saint <hi>Far</hi> thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
oblig'd to offer him his Service as a Neighbour, and did not
leave him till he had seen him carried to his Bed-chamber; after
which Madam <hi>Saldagne</hi> intreated him to protect her against her
Brother's Fury, and came along with him, as his Sister did
with us. He intended therefore to secure her in the same Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer-house
in the Garden where we were, as I said before; and
being as much afraid lest we should see his Lady, as we were care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
he should not see ours, the two Sisters by this Accident meeting
together, just as he was coming in, and we going out, I hapned
to catch his Lady by the Hand, whilst he laid hold by a like mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake
upon mine; and thus the Ladies were exchang'd. Which
was the more easily done, by reason I had put out my Candle,
and the Ladies so terribly dismay'd as well as we, that they did
not know what they did in the Hurry. As soon as we had left
her in the Summer-house, Saint <hi>Far</hi> finding himself alone with
a very handsom Lady, and having more Instinct than Reason,
or, to describe him in his natural Colours, being indeed a very
Brute, he takes advantage of the Opportunity, never minding the
Consequence, or what an irreparable Affront he offer'd to a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
that had thrown her self into his Arms for Protection. His
Brutality was rewarded as it deserved. Madam <hi>de Lery</hi> defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
her self like a Lioness, bit him, scratch'd him, and made him
bloody all over. After all which, he only went up to Bed and slept
as soundly as if he had done the best Action in the World. You
wonder perhaps which way Madam <hi>Lery</hi> hapned to be in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
at the time we were surpriz'd by her Brother, since there were
none besides her Sister and her Waiting-Woman. This puzled
me as well as you; but at last I learnt from 'em both, that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
<hi>Saldagne,</hi> not daring to trust her Waiting-Woman with the
Secret of her Amours, had persuaded her Sister to attend her in
the Garden; and this was the Person I entertain'd under the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
of <hi>Maudlin.</hi> Here my Wonder was at an end, how a Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bermaid
should be Mistress of so much Wit as I found in her
Conversation: And Madam <hi>de Lery</hi> told me, she was no less
puzled to find me so witty in the Garden by Night, and such a
Blockhead by Day, when she mistook the dull <hi>Britan</hi> to be the
same with me. Ever after that we entertain'd Sentiments for one
another something above a bare Esteem; and I dare say she was
not less satisfied than I, to find our Conditions more equal, than
if either of us had been a Mercenary Servant. The Day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
while we were yet talking together, We left our Ladies
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:53808:44"/>
in my Chamber, where they might sleep if they would, whilst
<hi>Verville</hi> and I went to consult, what was next to be done. For
my part, having no Love-fancies to disturb my Breast, as <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville</hi>
had, I died almost for want of sleep; but there was no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance,
I should abandon my Friend with such a load of Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness.
I had a Footman as Subtle and Witty, as <hi>Verville</hi>'s <hi>Valet
de Chambre</hi> was dull and Blockish; I gave him what Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
I could, and sent him to make Discovery how Affairs stood
at <hi>Saldagne</hi>'s. He perform'd his Message very discreetly, and
brought us this Account, that <hi>Saldagne</hi>'s Servants reported, the
Thieves had desperately wounded their Master; but as for his
Sisters, there was no more mention made of them, than if there
had never been any such alive, whether he little car'd for 'em,
or because he gave positive Orders to his Servants not to speak
of 'em, to stifle such disadvantageous Rumours. I see here
must be something of a Duel after all this, said <hi>Verville;</hi> nay,
perhaps something of a Murder, replyed I: Whereupon I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
him that <hi>Saldagne</hi> was the same Hector that intended
to murder me at <hi>Rome,</hi> and how we came to know one another
in the Garden; adding withal, that if he did but imagine,
as there was all the likelyhood in the World, that I lay there in
wait to take my Revenge of him; then certainly he could not
at all suspect the intelligence between his Sister and us.</p>
                  <p>I went to give an account to those fair Ladies of our Discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and in the mean time, <hi>Verville</hi> Visited Saint <hi>Far,</hi> to sound
his Sentiments, and discover the truth of our Suspicions. He
soon perceiv'd his Face full of scratches; but whatever question
<hi>Verville</hi> put to him, he could get no other Answer, save only,
that as he came from the Gaming-house, he found <hi>Saldagne</hi>'s
Garden-Door open, his House in an Uproar, and himself very,
much Wounded in the hands of his Servants, who were carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him to his Chamber. A very strange Accident, said <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville,</hi>
no doubt but his Sisters will take it very much to Heart:
They are very handsom Ladies, and I must go and give 'em <hi>a</hi>
Visit. What's that to me, said this Brute; who then fell a
Whistling, not minding or giving any answer to whatever his
Brother afterwards desir'd to know. <hi>Verville</hi> left him, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
to my Chamber, where I was employing all my Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
to comfort our fair Distress'd Ladies. They were Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consolate
even to Desperation; and apprehended the roughest
usage from their Brother's Jealousie and Savage Humour, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Man wholly enslav'd to his Passions. My Lacquy brought
'em some Meat from the next Cook, which he continu'd to do
for fifteen Days together; so long were they conceal'd in my
Chamber; which was above the rest, and so much out of the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:53808:45"/>
common Road and Passage, that no Body disturb'd 'em in the
least. They could willingly have put themselves into some
Nunnery for shelter; but after their sad Adventure, they had
just reason to fear, their Brother would have confin'd 'em lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
than they should care for. In the mean time, <hi>Saldagne</hi>'s
Wounds were in a fair way of Curing, and Saint <hi>Far,</hi> as
we observ'd, went every day to visit him. <hi>Verville</hi> stirr'd not
out of my Room, which was not taken much notice of in the
Family, he being wont to pass many whole Days in it, either
Reading, or in Discourse with me. His Love for Madam <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dagne</hi>
encreas'd every day, neither did she love him less. Her
Eldest Sister lik'd me pretty well, nor was she indifferent to me.
Not that my Passion for <hi>Leonora</hi> was abated; but I had no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of hopes from her, thô I might have obtain'd her, yet
should I have made it a matter of Conscience, to render her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy.
Upon a certain day, <hi>Verville</hi> receiv'd a Note from <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dagne,</hi>
wherein he challeng'd him to meet him with a Second
in the Plain of <hi>Grenelle,</hi> to decide their Quarrel by the Sword
By the same Note, he desir'd <hi>Verville</hi> to bring no other but
my self against him, which made me suspect he intended to
take us both in the same Trap. My suspicion was not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
groundless, having already experienced his Treachery;
however, <hi>Verville</hi> would not mind it, resolving to give him any
just Satisfaction, and to offer a Marriage with his Sister. He
sent for a Hackney Coach, thô there were three belonging to
the Family. We went to the place of Assignation, where <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dagne</hi>
waited for us, and where <hi>Verville</hi> was much astonish'd to
find his own Brother, seconding his Enemy. We omitted nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Submissions nor Intreaties, to bring all things to a fair Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation,
but nothing less than Fighting would serve the
turn of those two unjust and irrational Men. I was about to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
to Saint <hi>Far,</hi> how much it was against my Will to draw
my Sword against him; he told me bluntly, that he never lik'd
me in his Life, nor could any thing endear me to him, till he
open'd a passage or two with his Sword point, for his good
will to enter at. With these words he came fiercely towards
me: I only put by his Thrusts for some time, resolv'd, if possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to grapple with him, and so Disarm him, thô with appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
danger of being Wounded my self. Fortune befriended my
good Intention, for he slipt down at my Feet; I gave him time
to rise, and that which should have made him my Friend, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd
his Enmity. In fine, having given me a slight Wound in
the Shoulder, he vapour'd like a Bully-huff, and cry'd, I think
you feel me now.—My Patience being worn out, I prest
upon him, and having put him into Disorder, I got so happily
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:53808:45"/>
within his Sword, that I seiz'd on the Hilt. The Man you
hate so very much, said I, will however give you your Life,
Sir,—He struggled a while to no purpose, and would not
reply a Word, like an obstinate rash Brute as he was, though I
represented to him it was our Duty to go and part his Brother
from <hi>Saldagne,</hi> who were grappled, and fowling over one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
upon the Ground. But I perceiv'd I must be more rough;
and therefore wrench'd his Hand, and forc'd away his Sword,
which I threw a great distance from him. I ran immediately
to assist <hi>Verville,</hi> who was closed with his Antagonist. When
I came up to 'em, I saw afar off several Horsemen galloping
towards us; <hi>Saldagne</hi> was soon after Disarm'd, and at the same
instant, I found my self run through the back by Saint <hi>Far.</hi>
I could no longer Master my Resentment, and so return'd him
a thrust, that made no little Wound. The Baron <hi>d'Arques</hi> his
Father, who came in at that Moment, and saw me wound his
Son, did now hate me, as much as he lov'd me before. He
spurr'd his Horse up towards me, and gave me a great blow
on the Head. Those that came with him, followed his Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and joyntly set upon me. I defended my self most happily
from so many Enemies, but must needs at last have fallen a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
to this Multitude, if <hi>Verville,</hi> the most generous Friend on
Earth, had not thrust himself betwixt them and me, at the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
of his own Life. He gave his own Footman a good cut
over the Pate, because he found him more forward than the rest,
to get his Masters Applause. I yielded up my Sword to the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,
but that could not appease him; he call'd me Rascal, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful
Villain, and all the Injurious Names his Anger could
suggest him, even so far as to threaten to have me hang'd. I
boldly reply'd, that as much Rascal and ungrateful Villain as
I am, I had given his Eldest Son his Life, nor had I offer'd to
hurt him, till he had treacherously wounded me. <hi>Verville</hi> main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
to his Father, I was in the right; but he said, he would
never see my Face again. <hi>Saldagne</hi> went with the Baron <hi>d'Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques</hi>
into the Coach, where they had already put Saint <hi>Far;</hi> and
<hi>Verville,</hi> who would by no means leave me, took me into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with himself. He set me down at one of our Princes Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
where he had many Friends, and return'd to his Father's
soon after. Monsieur <hi>de Saint Sauveur</hi> sent a Coach for me that
very Night, and carried me privately to his own House; where
he took as great care of me, as if I had been his only Son. <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville</hi>
came to see me the next day following, and told me, his
Father had been inform'd of the Challenge by <hi>Saldagne</hi>'s Sisters,
whom he happen'd to find in my Chamber. He after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
assur'd me with a great deal of Joy, that the Business
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:53808:46"/>
was made up by an Agreement of a Double Marriage to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summate,
as soon as his Brothers Wounds were healed, which
were not in any dangerous place. That it lay in my Power to
be made Friends with <hi>Saldagne;</hi> and that his Father's Anger
was appeas'd, who was very sorry he had Misused me. He
added, he wish'd I might soon recover, to be a sharer of their
Joy; but I reply'd, I could not find in my Heart to stay in a
Country, where they might Reproach me with the meanness of
my Birth, as his Father did; but would soon leave the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
either to lose my Life in the Wars, or raise my self by
my Sword, to a condition proportionate to the Sentiments of
Honour, his noble Example had inspir'd me with. I am apt to
believe, he was concern'd at my Resolution; but a Man in Love
cannot mind any thing long besides his own Passion. Destiny
was thus pursuing his story, when they heard the Report of a
Gun in the Street, and presently after one playing upon a pair of
Organs. This kind of Musick never perhaps us'd at the Gate of
an Inn, call'd all those People to their Windows, that had been
wak'd with the Gun. In the mean time the Organs plaid on,
and those who were no strangers to such Instruments, took no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
that the Organs plaid a Church-Tune. No Body could ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
the Design of so devout a Serenade, which however,
was not yet acknowledg'd for such. But the doubt was soon
clear'd by two pitiful Voices; the one of which squeal'd out
a Treble part, and the other roar'd out a rumbling Base. These
two Catter-wauling Voices, were accompanied by the Organs,
and all together made such a horrible Consort, as set all the
Dogs a howling round about. They sung
<q>
                        <l>Our Warbling Notes, and Ivory Lute's,</l>
                        <l>Shall Ravish every Soul, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </l>
                     </q>
with the rest of that old Ditty; after these harsh Notes, they
over-heard a Person whispering as loud as ever he could, and
scolding at the Singer's for singing so Cuckoo-like, always in
one Tune. The poor Choristers reply'd, they knew not what
the Devil he would have them sing? Sing what you will else,
said he, speaking a little louder, for I will have singing for my
Money. Upon this peremptory Sentence, the Organs chang'd
their Tone, and another plous Anthem was sung; as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voutly
as before. None of the Hearers had yet dar'd to speak,
for fear of interrupting the Musick; when <hi>Rincour,</hi> who could
not for his Life hold his Tongue on this Occasion, baul'd out
aloud: What! do they use to perform Divine Service here in
the Street? One of the Assistants said, they were singing. Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nebrae
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:53808:46"/>
in good earnest: 'Tis a Nightly Procession, adds a third
In fine, every merry Fellow in the, Inn, had his Jest upon the
Musick; neither could any one guess, who was the Serenading
Fool, nor whom he design'd to Complement. In the mean time
the Anthem was carrying on to a Conclusion; when ten or
a dozen Dogs which followed a proud Bitch, ran in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the Musicians Legs; and because many Rivals cannot
be long together without Quarrelling, after some Grumbling,
Snarling, and Grinning of Teeth; they fell together by the
Ears of a sudden, with so much<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Fury and Animosity, that the
poor Musicians to save their Shins, betook themselves to their
Heels, leaving the Organs at the mercy of the Dogs. These
immoderate Lovers were so uncivil, in the heat of their scuffle,
as to throw down the Harmonious Machine, with the Frame
that supported it; and I should be loath to Swear, that some of
these cursed Dogs did not lift up a Leg, and pis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> upon the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
Organs, those Creatures being very Diuretick in their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
especially when some Bitch or other of their Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
is dispos'd to proceed to the Multiplication of her Species.
The Consort being thus out of Tune, mine Host order'd the
Inn Door to be open'd, intending to secure the Organs, with the
Table and Trestle on which it stood, from farther Mischief.
whilst he and his Servants were busie about this charitable Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
The Organist return'd accompani'd by three Persons, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
whom were a Woman, and a Man mufled up in his
Cloak. This Man was the very <hi>Ragotin</hi> in Person, who design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Serenade Madam <hi>Star.</hi> addrest himself for that purpose to
a little Eunuch, Organist of a Church. 'Twas this Monster,
neither Man nor Woman, that sung the treble Part, and play'd
on the Organs which his Maid had brought; an overgrown
Chorister sung the Base, both for the sum of two Testers, such
was the scarcity of Provisions in the plentiful Country of <hi>Mayne.</hi>
As soon as the Inn-keeper found out the Author of the Serenade,
he cry'd aloud, on purpose to be heard by all that were at the
Window: Is it then you, Mosieur <hi>Ragotin,</hi> that come with
your Vespers to my Door? You had best go to Bed, and not
disturb my Guests at this time of Night. <hi>Ragotin</hi> reply'd, that
he was mistaken in his Man, and yet spoke it so, as if he inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to discover what he seem'd to deny. In the mean time, the
Organist finding his Instrument much batter'd, and being a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

Servants gave their Votes for the Organist; but <hi>Ragotin</hi> made

them understand like a parcel of ignorant Fools as they were,
that this was never the Custom in Serenades, and so went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
very proud of his Gallantry. The Musicians laid the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
on the back of the Eunuch's Maid, who carried it home to
her Masters House. He in a very melancholy Mood, following
her with the Table over his shoulders, and attended by the Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rister
with the two Trestles. The Inn-Doors were lock'd up
again, <hi>Destiny</hi> wish'd the Ladies good Night, and deferr'd the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder
of his story to the next Opportunity.</p>

                  <p>THE next day the Players assembled betimes in the Morning

Rehearse the Play they were to Act that Afternoon. <hi>Rancour,</hi>

And Maliciously intreated them, that whenever he hinted
it, they would take no notice of it, but put him off with some

Country, said <hi>Destiny?</hi> But whom did you intend it for? Was
it not, continued he, for the fair Lady that set so many honest
Dogs together by the Ears? No doubt on't, said <hi>Olive,</hi> for those
snarling Curs would never have disturb'd such harmonious Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick,
had they not been Monsieur <hi>Ragotin</hi>'s Rivals, and jealous
of him. Another of the Company would needs have his Jest,
and said, without doubt he is in his Ladies Favour, and means
nothing but honourable Love, since he Courts her in the open
Street. In short, every one in the Room had a fling at <hi>Ragotin,</hi>
about his Serenade, except <hi>Rancour,</hi> who spar'd him, as having
the Honour of being his Confident; and it is probable, this
currish Raillery had still employ'd the whole Company, if the
Poet, (who, in his kind, was as Vain and Ridiculous a Coxcomb
as <hi>Ragotin,</hi> and in every thing endeavour'd to gratifie his Pride,)
had not taken them off, by telling them with the tone of a
Man of Quality, or rather of a false Pretender to it: Now you
speak of Serenades, I remember that when I was Married, I had
one bestow'd on me, which lasted a Fortnight together, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
of a hundred several sorts of Instruments. It ranged all over
the <hi>Marcts:</hi> The genteelest Ladies in the <hi>Place Royal,</hi> took it upon
their Account; several <hi>Beaus</hi> assum'd the Honour of it; Nay,
and a Man of Quality took such a fit of Jealousie upon it, that he
order'd his Men to fall foul upon those who bestow'd it on me
only. But they met with their Match, for these were all my
own Country-Men, as brave Fellows, as ever piss'd against a
Wall, and most of them had been Officers of a Regiment I
rais'd, in the late Insurrection of the Commons in our Parts.
<hi>Rancour</hi> who check'd his Bantering Humour in favour of <hi>Rago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin,</hi>
could not be so civil to the Poet, whom he continually
plagu'd. Wherefore he took up the Cudgels against this Darling
of the Muses, and told him: Your Serenade, as you describe
it, sounded more of Bedlam, or the Procession of Rams-horns,
than any of Gallantry, and so probably importuned the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of Quality, to send out his Footmen either to silence, or
drive away the horrid Noise. And what confirms me in my
Opinion, is, the Consideration of your Bride, who died for
Age, within six Months after your Hymeneal Solemnity, as
you term it, was over: Nay, but she died of a fit of the Mother,
said the Poet,—say, rather of a fit of the Grandmother, or Great
Grandmother, replied <hi>Rancour:</hi> For, added he, in the very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth's Reign, she was past having any
Fits of the Mother; and to let you know that I am better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with her, than even you your self, though you tell us
daily such Wonders of her, I will now relate to you a passage of
her Life, which never came to your Knowledge. <hi>In the Court
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:53808:50"/>
of Queen</hi> Margaret.—This beginning of a History drew all
the Company in a Ring about <hi>Rancour,</hi> whom they knew to be
furnish'd with malicious Memories against all Human kind.
But the Poet who dreaded him extreamly, interrupted him, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
I lay a hundred Pistoles to the contrary: Which abrupt
Defiance, made the Company so merry, that they laught him
out of the Room. This was his usual way, by such wagers of
considerable Sums, to maintain his daily Hyperboles, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted
to the weekly Sum of a thousand or twelve Hundred
Impertinencies, besides the innumerable downright Lies he ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
into the Bargain. Now <hi>Rancour</hi> was the Comptroller Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
both of his Words and Actions, and the Ascendent he had
over him was so great, that I dare compare it to the Genius of
<hi>Augustus</hi> over <hi>Anthony;</hi> that is to say, like to like, without put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
a brace of Strollers in the Scale, against two famous <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.
Rancour</hi> having thus begun his story, and being inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
by the Poet, as I said before, every one earnestly intreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him to pursue it: But he excus'd himself, promising to give
'em, another time, a faithful account of the Poet's whole Life,
wherein his Wive's should be likewise interwoven. It was now
high time to rehearse the Play, that was to be acted the same
day in a Neighbouring Tennis-Court: Nothing worth Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
hapned at the Rehearsal. After Dinner they acted their
Play, and came off with great Applause. Madam <hi>Star</hi> charm'd
the whole Audience with her Beauty; <hi>Angelica</hi> did not want
Admirers, and both of 'em acted their Parts to the general Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction.
<hi>Destiny</hi> and his Comrades did wonderfully well, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that many of the Audience who had often seen Plays acted
at <hi>Paris,</hi> confest, that the King's Players could hardly have act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
better. <hi>Ragotin</hi> in his Heart and Mind, ratified the Donative
he had made of his Body and Soul to Madam <hi>Star,</hi> in presence
of <hi>Rancour,</hi> who promis'd him every day to persuade his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress
to accept it. Without this Promise, Despair had soon made
this little pitiful Lawyer, the Noble Subject of some great Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical
Story. I cannot tell whether the Men pleas'd as well the
Ladies of <hi>Mans</hi> in their Acting, as the Women did the Men.

                  <p>AS soon as <hi>Destiny</hi> had stript himself of his old Embroidery,
and put on his ordinary wearing Apparel, <hi>La Rappiniere</hi>
carried him to the common Goals, because the Man they had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
that day the Curate of <hi>Domfront</hi> was set upon, desir'd to
speak with him. In the mean time the Actresses went home to
their Inn with a great Attendance of Citizens. <hi>Ragotin</hi> happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to be near <hi>Cave,</hi> as she came out of the Tennis-Court, where
they had acted, offer'd her his Hand, to lead her home, thô he
would<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> rather have paid that civil Office to his Dear <hi>Star;</hi>
he did the like to <hi>Angelica,</hi> so that he was Squire to the right
and left. This double Civility occasion'd a treble inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy;
for <hi>Cave,</hi> who had the upper hand, as in all reason she ought,
was crowded to the Wall by <hi>Ragotin,</hi> that <hi>Angelica</hi> might not be
forc'd to walk in the Kennel. Besides, this little Dwarf reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no higher than their Wasts, pull'd down their Hands so
much, that they could scarce keep themselves from tumbling
over him. But that which most troubled them was, his often
looking behind him to stare on Madam <hi>Star,</hi> who was talking
to a Brace of Country <hi>Beaux,</hi> that would by all means
lead her to her Lodgings against her Will. The poor Actresses
endeavour'd many times to get loose from their Gentleman-Usher,
but he held so fast, that they thought themselves in Fetters.
They desir'd him a hundred times to spare himself that trouble;
he only answer'd, your Servant, your Servant, (his ordinary Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment)
and grip'd their Hands still harder and harder. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they were fain to be patient, till they came to their Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber-stairs,
where they hop'd to be set at Liberty; but <hi>Ragotin</hi>
was better bred: And repeating only, your Servant, your Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
to all they could say, he endeavour'd at first to go up with
'em abreast, which he found impossible: Then <hi>Cave</hi> turn'd her
back to the Wall, and crept up side-long, dragging <hi>Ragotin</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
her, who dragg'd <hi>Angelica</hi> in like manner, she dragging no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
but laughing like a Fool. Now as an Additional Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency,
when they were within four or five steps of their Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
down comes a Servant belonging to the Inn, with a huge
sack of Oats of an excessive Weight, who with much adoe, so
heavy was his Load, bid them go down again, for he could not
get up again with his Burden. <hi>Ragotin</hi> would needs argue the
case with him; the Fellow swore bluntly, he would let fall his
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:53808:51"/>
Sack upon 'em. This made them go down again much faster
than they went up; but <hi>Ragotin</hi> would not let go his hold. The
Man with the Oats prest hastily upon 'em, which caus'd <hi>Ragotin</hi>
to miss a step, so that he hung in the Air, holding still the Play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
by the Hand, till he pull'd down <hi>Cave</hi> upon him, who sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
him more than her Daughter, by reason of the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of the Place. Thus she tumbled down upon him, lighting
with her Feet on the Pigmy's Belly and Breast, and knock'd her
Head so fiercely against her Daughter's, that they lay all three
tumbling on the Floor. The Fellow thinking they could not
easily get up time enough, and being no longer able to support
his Load, let's his Sack down upon the Stairs, swearing and
cursing like an Ostler. The Sack bursts open with the Fall,
and then came in mine Host, who scolded like mad at the Ostler.
But as he was mad at the Fellow; so the Fellow was mad as the
Players, and they as mad at <hi>Ragotin,</hi> who was as mad as the
maddest of 'em all; because Madam <hi>Star,</hi> coming not far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
'em, was Witness of this Disgrace, not much inferior to
the late Adventure of the deep-crown'd Hat; wherein his Head

a pair of Cizars broke the Inchantment. <hi>Cave</hi> took her great
Oath, that <hi>Ragotin</hi> should never lead her again, and shew'd Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
<hi>Star,</hi> how black and blew he had squeez'd her Hands.
<hi>Star</hi> told her, 'twas a just Judgment upon her, for Robbing her
of Monsieur <hi>Ragotin,</hi> who had engag'd himself to bring her back
to her Lodgings after the Play; adding, she was glad of the Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance
that was befallen, him, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

he heard nothing of all this, being all the while in Dispute

Oats, and had already offer'd to beat his Servant on the same
account, who for that reason beat <hi>Ragotin,</hi> and call'd him Petty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fogger.
<hi>Angelica</hi> began to banter him in her turn, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach'd
him with his Infidelity to Mistress <hi>Star:</hi> In fine, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
did plainly shew how little she was yet concern'd in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
made to <hi>Ragotin,</hi> of making him gain her Affection to
that Degree, as would make him more happy than any Lover in
the whole Country of <hi>Mayne.</hi> Nay, <hi>La Parche</hi> and <hi>Leval</hi> added
to it. The Oats were gather'd up again, and the Actresses went
up into their Chamber one by one, without any further Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.
<hi>Ragotin</hi> did not follow them, nor can I exactly tell, what
became of him. Supper-time came, and to Supper they went:
After Supper, every one withdrew to their respective Affairs, and
<hi>Destiny</hi> lock'd himself up with the Actresses, in order to pursue his
story.</p>

                  <p>I Made the foregoing Chapter a little of the shortest; perhaps
this will prove somewhat longer; however I am not sure of
it; but we shall see. <hi>Destiny</hi> took his usual Seat, and resum'd
his Tale in this manner. I shall finish my Story as briefly as I
can possible, fearing I have tir'd you too much already with the
Account of my Life and Fortune. <hi>Verville</hi> having given me a
Visit, as I said before, and not being able to persuade me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to his Father's: He left me in all appearance much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
at the Resolution I had taken, and went home; where a
while after he married Madam <hi>Saldagne,</hi> as Saint <hi>Far</hi> did Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
<hi>Lery.</hi> She had as much Wit as Saint <hi>Far</hi> had Dulness; and
I wonder how two Persons of such unequal Talents have liv'd
together in the Matrimonial Society. In the mean time, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
recover'd, and the generous Monsieur <hi>de Saint Sanveur,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving
of my Design of leaving the Kingdom, furnish'd me
with Money for my Journey; and <hi>Verville,</hi> who did not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get,
though now married presented me with a good Horse, and
a Hundred Pistols. I took my Journey towards <hi>Lyons</hi> to pass in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Italy,</hi> with design to go once more to <hi>Rome,</hi> and after having
taken my last Farewel of <hi>Leonora,</hi> to repair with speed to <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi>
there to put an end to my wretched Life. At <hi>Nevers</hi> I
lodg'd at an Inn which stood near the River; and coming thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
very early, and not knowing how to spend my time till
Supper were ready, I went to take a Walk on a great Stone-Bridge,
which lies cross the River <hi>Loir.</hi> There were a couple
of Women walking there at the same time; one of which, that
look'd as if she were sick, lean'd on the others Shoulder, and had
much ado to crawl along. As I past by 'em, I pull'd my Hat
off to 'em, without taking notice of their Faces, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
walking for some time on the said Bridge, still keeping my
Thoughts employ'd about my Misfortunes, and chiefly about
my Amours. I was well enough clad, as all those ought to be,
whose Quality cannot excuse an indifferent Habit. When I came
again near these Women; I over-heard one of 'em say: For my
part, I should believe it, had we not heard he was dead.

I cannot tell how I came to look behind me, having no Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to think they spoke of me; and yet no Man but my self was
the Subject of their Discourse. I presently found the first La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
was Madam <hi>la Boissiere,</hi> grown very pale and wan, who
rested upon her Daughter <hi>Leonora</hi>'s Shoulder. Thereupon I
made directly towards them, with more assurance, than I had
in <hi>Rome,</hi> having improv'd my self, both as to my Person and Wit,
during my stay in <hi>Paris.</hi> I found 'em so surpriz'd and amaz'd,
that I verily believe they would have fled from me, had Madam
<hi>la Boissiere</hi> been able to run; and this surpriz'd me no less. I
ask'd them what happy Chance brought me to the Presence of
two Persons whom I esteem'd above all the World. These Words
dispell'd their Fears. Madam <hi>de la Bossiere</hi> told me, I ought not
to wonder to see 'em look upon me with some Astonishment,
since Signior <hi>Stephano</hi> had shew'd 'em a Letter from one of those
Gentlemen I waited on at <hi>Rome,</hi> by which he was inform'd of
my being kill'd in the War of <hi>Parma;</hi> adding, she was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd
to find that News false, which had been so unwelcome to
her. I replied, That Death was not the greatest Misfortune that
could befal me, and that I was going to <hi>Venice</hi> to court it, and,
if possible, spread the Report of my Death with more certainty
than before. They grew sad at my Resolution; and the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
began to express a great deal of Tenderness to me; the
Cause of which I cou'd not well guess. At last I learnt from her
self the Ground of her Civility. I was now in a Capacity to
serve her; and her present Condition would not allow her to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise
and look coldly on me, as she had done in <hi>Rome.</hi> They had
met with a Misfortune which had put them to great Streights:
For having turn'd all their Furniture into ready Money, they
left <hi>Rome,</hi> with a <hi>French</hi> Maid that had serv'd 'em a long time,
and Signior <hi>Stephano</hi>'s Man, a <hi>Fleming</hi> like himself, who would
needs return to his Native Country. This Fellow and the
Wench, it seems, lov'd each other enought to venture a Match;
and yet they kept their Amour so private, that no Body ever
discover'd it. Madam <hi>la Boissiere</hi> being come to <hi>Rouenne,</hi> went
by Water thence. At <hi>Nevers</hi> she found her self so very ill, that
she could go no further. During her Sickness she was somewhat
hard to be pleas'd, and her Maid more unwilling to humour her
than ever she had been before. One Morning, the Wench and
her Paramour were missing; and, which was more grievous still,
the poor Lady's Money was missing also. Her Grief encreas'd
her Distemper, and she was forc'd to stay at <hi>Nevers</hi> till she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
Letters from <hi>Paris,</hi> from whence she expected a Supply to
proceed in her Journey. Madam <hi>la Boissiere</hi> told me this sad
Adventure in few Words. I led 'em back again to their Inn, which
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:53808:53"/>
was the same where I had taken up my Quarters; where after I
had brought 'em to their Chamber, and stood a while with 'em,
I retir'd to my own, leaving 'em to their Supper. For my own
part, I could not eat a Bit, but thought it was at least five or six
Hours while I was at Table. I waited upon 'em as soon as
they had given me notice that I should be welcome. I found
the Mother in Bed, and the Daughter receiv'd me with a
Countenance as sad as it appear'd joyful a Moment before. The
Mother was still more sad than the Daughter, and I griev'd
for Company. We star'd a while upon one another without speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Word. At last Madam <hi>de la Boissiere</hi> shew'd me a Letter
she had newly receiv'd from <hi>Paris,</hi> which cast both her and her
Daughter <hi>Leonora</hi> into the deepest Affliction in the World. She
express'd the Reason of her Grief with a Flood of Tears, and her
Daughter <hi>Leonora</hi> wept also most bitterly; which mov'd me so
sensibly, that I thought I did not express my Sense of it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
though I proffer'd 'em all I could possibly do for their
Assistance, with such a Freedom, as put my Sincerity out of all
douht. I am as yet unacquainted with the Cause of your Grief,
said I; But if my Life may any way contribute to your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
you may set your Mind at rest. Tell me therefore, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
what I must do to serve you: Money I have, if you
want any; and Courage likewise if you fear any Enemies;
and the Satisfaction of having serv'd you, is the only Recompence
I expect for doing you Service. My Words and my Countenance
gave them so full an Assurance of the reality of my Sentiments,
that their Affliction was somewhat abated. Madam <hi>de la Bois<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siere</hi>
gave me a Letter to peruse, wherein a Gentlewoman of
her Acquaintance inform'd her, that a certain Person, who was
nameless, but whom I judg'd to be <hi>Leonora</hi>'s Father, was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to leave the Court, and had retir'd himself into <hi>Holland.</hi>
Thus this poor Lady found her self in a strange Country, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
either Money, or the least Hopes of getting any. I made
her a second Proffer of the small Stock I had, which might a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount
to Five Hundred Crowns; and told her, I would wait
upon her into <hi>Holland,</hi> or any other Part of the World she had
a mind to go to. In short, I assur'd her, she had found in me a
Person that would do her all the Service she could expect from a
Valet, and serve and honour her like a dutiful Son. I blush'd
extremely at this Word of Son: But I was no more that hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Man, who was denied Admittance to their House in <hi>Rome,</hi>
and to whom <hi>Leonora</hi> was invisible; for now <hi>Leonora</hi> was much
more civil, and her Mother less severe. At every Offer I made
she still replied, <hi>Leonora</hi> would be very much oblig'd to me. All
was scor'd upon <hi>Leonora</hi>'s Account, insomuch that one would
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:53808:54"/>
have taken her Morher to have been only a Waiting-Woman
that spoke in her Mistress's behalf: So true it is, that the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
of the World respect People only so far as they are subser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient
to their own Interest. I left them very much comforted,
and retired my self to my Chamber the most contented Man that
could be. I past the Night very pleasantly, tho' waking, which
kept me somewhat late in Bed, for 'twas break of Day before I
began to sleep. <hi>Leonora</hi> appear'd to me that Day more nicely
drest than the Day before; and she could not but observe that I
had taken a little more care of my self. I led her to Mass with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
her Mother, who was as yet too weak to go abroad. We
dined together, and from that time forward were but one Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
Madam <hi>de la Boissiere</hi> very thankfully acknowledged the
good Offices I tendred them, and oftentimes assured me, she
would not die in my Debt. I sold my Horse; and no sooner
had the sick Lady recover'd her Strength, but we took a
Tilt-boat, and went down the River to <hi>Orleance.</hi> During the
time we were on the Water, I enjoy'd my <hi>Leonora</hi>'s Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
nor was so great a Felicity interrupted by her Mother. I
found her Wit as sprightly and charming as her Looks; nor had
she Reason to think mine so dull as she had found it in <hi>Rome.</hi>
What can I say more? In short, she was as much taken with
me, as I was captivated by her; and you may witness ever since
you have seen us together, how little our reciprocal Affection is
diminished—What! said <hi>Angelica,</hi> interrupting him, is then
Madam <hi>Star</hi> that <hi>Leonora?</hi> Who else? answer'd <hi>Destiny.</hi> At
which Madam <hi>Star</hi> was pleas'd to say, her Friend had reason to
question whether she were that <hi>Lenoora,</hi> whom <hi>Destiny</hi> had made
the Heroin of a Romance. 'Tis not upon that score I start the
Question, replied <hi>Angelica,</hi> but rather because we are ever in
doubt of what we most desire. Madam <hi>Cave</hi> said, that for her
part she was confident of this from the beginning, but desir'd
them to wave that Discourse till <hi>Destiny</hi> had made an end of his
Story; who went on thus. We arriv'd at <hi>Orleance;</hi> where our
Entrance was so pleasant, as well deserves a paticular Relation.
A Pack of Scoundrels, who always wait in expectation of Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
at the Water-side, to carry home their Goods, crouded in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
our Boat. There were at least thirty that offer'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to take up two or three little Bundles betwixt 'em, which
the weakest of these lazy Rogues might have carried singly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his Arm. Had I been alone, perhaps I had not been so wise
as to bear calmly with their Insolence. Eight of them seiz'd
upon a little Bundle, not weighing much above twenty Pounds,
which they seem'd to lift up from the Ground with much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
and having got it betwixt 'em, they held it aloft above
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:53808:54"/>
their Heads, upon their Fingers ends. All the Mob that stood
by on the River-side fell a laughing, and we were fain to do the
like. However I blush'd as Red as Scarlet to go thorough the
whole Town with such a Retinue: For the rest of our Goods,
which would not have loaden one Porter, employ'd twenty at
least, my very Pistols being carried in State by four lusty Rogues.
The Order of our March at our Entrance into the Town was
thus: First eight Hang-Dogs, either drunk, or such as ought to
have been drunk, carried the little Box behind 'em, as I told you
before. Next follow'd my Pistols and Holsters, each carried by two
Fellows. Madam <hi>de la Boissiere,</hi> no less vex'd at it than my self,
went immediately after: She was sitting in a great Wicker-Chair,
fastned to a couple of Cowl-staves, and carried by four
Watermen, who reliev'd one another by Turns, and had a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
impertinent Jests as they went along. The rest of our Goods
came after her, being only a little Portmantle, and a Bundle co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
with Canvas, which seven or eight of these Rascals toss'd
from one to another all the way. I brought up the Rear of the
Triumph, leading <hi>Leonora</hi> by the Hand, who laugh'd so hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that I could not but be delighted with their Roguery in spite
of my self. As we march'd along, the Passengers stood still, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
upon us; and the Noise they made on this occasion drew
all the People to their Windows and Doors. At last we arriv'd
at the Suburbs, which is the Road towards <hi>Paris,</hi> attended with
abundance of Mob, and took up our Lodging at the Sign of
the Emperor. I put the Ladies into a Parlour, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
threatned the Rogues so seriously, that they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
to take a small Piece of Money for their Pains, the Inn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper
and his Wise taking my part against 'em. Madam <hi>de
la Boissiere,</hi> whom the Money I had furnish'd her withal sooner
cur'd than any Cordials besides could have done, found her self
strong enough to bear the Coach; wherefor I took up three
places in one that was to go the next Morning; and within two
Days after we arriv'd safe at <hi>Paris.</hi> As we lighted out of the
Coach at the Inn, I made Acquaintance with <hi>Rancour,</hi> who came
from <hi>Orleans</hi> in another Coach at the same time as ours. He
heard me enquire for the Inn to which the <hi>Calais</hi> Coach came,
and told me he was going thither immediately himself, and if we
had not hired a Lodging, he would carry us to a Woman of
his Acquaintance who let Lodgings ready furnish'd, where we
should have a very good Accommodation. We took his Word,
And found it as he told us. This Woman was the Widow of
one that had all his Life-time belong'd to a Play-House, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
as a Door-keeper, and sometimes as a Scene-man, and
even had try'd to act Under-parts, but was hiss'd of the Stage.
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:53808:55"/>
Having scrap'd some Money together at the Play-house, he fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd
a House, let Lodgings, took Boarders, and by all this
made a shift to get considerably. We took a couple of Rooms,
which were pretty convenient. Madam <hi>de la Boissiere</hi> receiv'd a
Confirmation of the ill News she had touching <hi>Leonora</hi>'s Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and heard so much besides, though she conceal'd it from
us, that it made her relapse into her former Disease. This put
off our Journey into <hi>Holland</hi> for a while, whither she resolv'd to
go under my Conduct; and <hi>Rancour,</hi> who was going into the
same Country to a Company of Players, was contented to stay
for us, upon my promising to defray his Charges. Madam <hi>de
la Boissiere</hi> receiv'd frequent Visits from one of her Friends, that
waited at the same time with her upon the Ambassador's Lady
at <hi>Rome,</hi> and had likewise been her Confident, whilst <hi>Leonora</hi>'s
Father made Love to her. This Woman acquainted her with
her pretended Husband's Retirement, and did us several good
Turns during the time we staid in <hi>Paris.</hi> I went out of Doors
as seldom as I could, for fear of being seen by some of my Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance;
nor did I find it a great Trouble to stay within, so
long as I enjoy'd my <hi>Leonora</hi>'s Company; whose Favour I gain'd
more and more by my constant Care of her Mother. Upon this
Woman's Persuasion, who, as I told you, came often to visit us,
we went one Day to Saint <hi>Clou,</hi> to air and refresh our sick La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.
Our Landlady came in for one amongst us, and <hi>Rancour</hi>
for another. We took a Boat when we came to the Waterside;
afterwards we walked in the fairest Gardens; and having made a
small Collation, <hi>Rancour</hi> conducted the Women towards the Boat,
whilst I staid behind to scan the Reckoning with an unreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Hostess, who kept me longer from 'em than I intended. I
got off as cheap as I could, and hastned to rejoyn my Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.
But I was not a little astonish'd to see the Boat gone a
good way from Shore, carrying my Company towards <hi>Paris,</hi>
and leaving me behind, without any notice, or so much as my
Footboy that had my Sword and Cloak to wait upon me. Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at the Water-side, very much troubled at their not waiting
for me, I heard a great Uproar in another Tilt-Boat that lay
there, and drawing somewhat near, I perceiv'd two or three
Gentlemen, or Persons that look'd like such, who would need
fall soul on a Waterman because he would not follow our Boat.
I leap'd at a venture into that Boat, just as it was launching forth,
the Waterman fearing he should be roughly handled. But if I
was troubled that my Company had left me at Saint <hi>Clou,</hi> I was
no less perplex'd to find that he that offer'd this Violence
was the same <hi>Saldagne,</hi> whom I had so much Reason to hate.
At the instant I discover'd him, he remov'd from the place he
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:53808:55"/>
sat in, and came just by me. I did not know which way to
look, and hid my Face from him the best I could. But finding him
so near, that it was impossible to conceal my self long, and knowing
I had no Sword, I took the most desperate Resolution that could
be, which hatred alone could not have suggested me, had it not
been attended with Jealousie. I seiz'd him by the Middle at the
same time he began to know me, and threw my self into the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
with him. He was not able to keep hold of my Clothes,
whether his Gloves hindred it, or his sudden Surprize. Never
was any Man nearer drowning than he. A great many of the
neighbouring Boats came in to save us, every one thinking we
had fallen into the Water Accidentally, except <hi>Saldagne,</hi> who
knew the Truth, but was not in a Condition to discover it so
soon, or to pursue me. So I got on Shore again without much
difficulty, having only a thin Sure on, which did not much hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
my swimming; and thinking it worth my labour to make
haste, I got far enough off from Saint <hi>Clou</hi> before <hi>Saldagne</hi> was
fish'd up. As they had not a little ado to save him, so, I dare say,
they could hardly believe his Relation how I threw him into the
Water, when he affirm'd I ventur'd my own drowning to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
his: For I cannot imagine why he should hide it from 'em.
I was forc'd to go a great way about to get into <hi>Paris,</hi> and durst
not enter the city till Night, having no need to dry my Clothes,
the heat of the Sun, and my violent Exercise, having left but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Moisture in them. At length I got to my dear <hi>Leonora,</hi> whom
I found in great Affliction. <hi>Rancour</hi> and our Landlady were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verjoy'd
to see me again, and so was Madam <hi>de la Boissiere</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
who the better to make her think I was her Son, acted
the Part of a distress'd Mother: She excus'd her self in private
to me for their not staying; assuring me the fright <hi>Saldagne</hi> put
'em into, hindred them from thinking on me; besides, that except
<hi>Rancour,</hi> the rest of our Company would have rather embarrast
than help'd me, if I had engag'd <hi>Saldagne.</hi> They told me, that at
their going from the Tavern, this Spark follow'd 'em to the
Water-side, where he very uncivilly press'd <hi>Leonora</hi> to unmask her
self; And her Mother discovering him to be the same Man that
had attempted the like at <hi>Rome,</hi> she shuffled into the Boat in a
fright, and made the Waterman put from the Shore, without
staying for me. <hi>Saldagne</hi> in the mean time having a couple of
Rakes like himself come to him, got into the next Boat with his
two Comrades, where I found him threatning the Waterman
to make him follow <hi>Leonora.</hi> This Adventure made me keep
more within Doors than I had done formerly. A little while
after Madam <hi>de la Boissiere</hi> fell sick, her Melancholy contributing
much to her Malady; which made us remain part of the Winter
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:53808:56"/>
at <hi>Paris.</hi> We were inform'd, that an <hi>Italian</hi> Prelate, who came
from <hi>Spain,</hi> was going into <hi>Flanders</hi> through <hi>Perone;</hi> and <hi>Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour</hi>
made Interest to have us comprehended in the Passport, in
Quality of Comedians. One Day, as we had waited upon this
<hi>Italian</hi> Prelate, who lodg'd in the Street <hi>de Seine,</hi> we sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
in a Frolick in the Suburbs of <hi>Saint Germains,</hi> with some
Players of <hi>Rancour</hi>'s Acquaintance. He and I going over the
<hi>Pont-neuf</hi> afterwards very late, were set upon by five or six
Rogues. I made the best defence I could, and to give <hi>Rancour</hi>
his due, he did as much as any brave Man could do, insomuch
that he sav'd my Life, tho' he could not keep me from being seiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by these Robbers, my Sword being unhappily fallen from my
Hands. <hi>Rancour</hi> got very stoutly out of their Clutches, with the
loss of a sorry Cloak only. As for me, I was plunder'd of all I
had about me, excepting my Doublet and Breeches. And to ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate
my Misfortune, they rifled me of an enamell'd Box with
<hi>Leonora</hi>'s Father's Picture, which Madam <hi>de la Boissiere</hi> had left
with me, to try what I could get for some Diamonds it had
round the Case. I found <hi>Rancour</hi> at the Bridge-foot, wounded
in the Arm and Face, as I was, though lightly, in the Head.
Madam <hi>de Boissiere</hi> was very much concern'd for the loss of the
Picture; but the Hopes of seeing the Original shortly comforted
her. In fine; we went from <hi>Paris</hi> to <hi>Perone;</hi> from <hi>Perone</hi> to <hi>Brus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels,</hi>
and from <hi>Brussels</hi> to the <hi>Hague;</hi> from whence <hi>Leonora</hi>'s Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was gone about a Fortnight before over into <hi>England,</hi> where
he intended to serve the King against the <hi>Parliamentarians. Leono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi>'s
Mother was so deeply afflicted at his Departure, that she fell
suddenly sick and died. As she was going to breath her last, she
saw me grieve as much as if I had been her own Son: She re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended
her Daughter to me, and made me engage I would
not forsake her, but endeavour to find out her Father, and restore
her to his Possession. Not long after, a <hi>Frenchman</hi> robb'd me
of all the rest of my Money, which reduc'd both <hi>Leonora</hi> and
me to that Necessity. that we were forc'd to get into your
Company, who accepted of us by the Recommendation of <hi>Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour.</hi>
You are acquainted with the rest of my Adventures, which
since that time have been common with us all, as far as <hi>Tours,</hi>
where I think I saw the Devil <hi>Saldagne;</hi> and, if I be not very
much mistaden, I believe it will not be long before I meet him
again in these Parts, which I fear less for my own part than
for <hi>Leonora</hi>'s, who would lose a most faithful Servant, if I
should miscarry, or be forc'd to part from her by my unlucky
Stars. Thus <hi>Destiny</hi> ended his Story; and after having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted
Madam <hi>Star</hi> a while, whom the Relation had a little
disorder'd, by renewing the Remembrance of her Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:53808:56"/>
which made her weep, as if they but newly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd,
he took his leave of the Actresses, and went to Bed.</p>

Stroller, being in Hell before his time, I mean in Love, before
his Death, was still in Bed, when <hi>Ragotin</hi> troubled him with
his Passion, as it were the Belly-ake, came to desire him to
mind his Business, and take pity on him. <hi>Rancour</hi> assur'd him,
that ere that day were over, he would do him a Notable piece
of Service with his Mistress. <hi>La Rappiniere</hi> entred at the same
time <hi>Rancour</hi>'s Chamber, who was still dressing himself; and
having taken him aside, confest his Infirmity to him, and vowed,
if he could bring him into favour with Madam <hi>Star,</hi> there was
nothing in his Power but he would do for him, even to the
making him one of his Assistants, and bestowing his Neece in
Marriage on him, whom he design'd to make sole Heiress after

                  <p>The cheating Rogue promiss'd him yet more than he had done
<hi>Ragotin,</hi> which put this Hangman's Purveyor in good Hopes.

                        </gap>ne</hi> came likewise to consult the Oracle: He was the most
incorrigible presumptuous Coxcomb, that ever came from the
Banks of <hi>Garonne,</hi> and one who thought every Body believ'd
what he Romanc'd about his good Family, Riches, Poetry and
Valour; insomuch, that he slighted all the dry Jests and Bobs
that <hi>Rancour</hi> perpetually put upon him, presuming that what he
did, was only for Conversation's sake: And besides, he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
Raillery as well as any Man alive, and bore it like a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Philosopher, even when it touch'd to the very quick. He
therefore imagin'd he was admir'd by all the Players, nay, even
by <hi>Rancour</hi> himself, who had experience enough to admire but
few things; and was so far from having a good Opinion of this
poor Brother of the Quill, that he made a full inquiry into his
Extraction, thereby to discover whether those Bishops and great
Lords, his Countrymen, whom he quoted ever and anon for
his Relations, were the true Branches of that Genealogick Tree,
this Fool of Noble Alliances, and Coats of Arms, together with
many other things, had caus'd to be drawn in an old Roll of
Parchment. He was very sorry to find <hi>Rancour</hi> in Company,
though he had less need to be troubled at that, than any one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
it being his ill Custom, to be ever whispering in Peoples
Ears, and to make a Secret of every thing, sometimes of nothing
However he took <hi>Rancour</hi> in a Corner, and at first very
gravely desir'd to know whether the Operator's Wife was a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of a great deal of Wit, or not; because he had lov'd Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of all Nations but the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and if she were worth his
Labour, he should not be much the poorer, if he presented h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>
with a hundred Pistols, which he as often mention'd upon every
trifling Occasion, as the great Family from whence he was Des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended.
<hi>Rancour</hi> told him, he was not so well acquainted with
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:53808:57"/>
                     <hi>Donna Inezilla,</hi> as to answer for her Wit, though he had often
met her Husband in the chiefest Cities of the Kingdom, where
he sold his Antidotes; but if he desir'd so much to be inform'd
about her Wit, 'twas but joining Conversation with her, since
she began to speak <hi>Erench</hi> tolerably well. <hi>Roquebrune</hi> would
needs entrust him with his Pedigree in Parchment, that he might
dazle the <hi>Spanish Donne</hi> with the splendor of his Race; but
<hi>Rancour</hi> told him, his Pedigree would sooner make him a Knight
of <hi>Maltha,</hi> than a happy Lover. Whereupon <hi>Roquebrune</hi> with
a smiling Countenance added; Well, Sir, you know what I
am. Yes, yes, replied <hi>Rancour,</hi> I know well enough what you
are now, and what you will ever be to your dying Day. The
Poet went away as he came, and <hi>Rancour,</hi> his Rival and Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
at the same time, drew near to <hi>La Rappiniere</hi> and <hi>Ragotin,</hi>
who were Rivals also, though unknown to each other. As for
old <hi>Rancour,</hi> besides that we naturally hate any one that endeavours
to rob us of what we design for our selves, and the general quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
he had against all Mankind; besides all this, I say, he ever
had a particular Aversion to the Poet, which this Discovery was
not likely to abate. <hi>Rancour</hi> therefore absolutely resolv'd, from
that time forward, to do him all the mischief he could possibly,
to which his apish Nature prompted him, and fitted him for:
And not to lose time, he began that very day, by basely borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Money of him, wherewith he new Cloathed himself from top
to toe, and stock'd himself with Linnen. He had before been
a sloven all his Life-time; but Love, which works far greater
Miracles, made him more curious of his Dress in his Declining
Days. He chang'd his Linnen oftner than did become a Stroller,
and began to Wash, Powder, and colour his gray Hairs, and
Trim himself so carefully, that his Comrades took notice of it.
The Players were that day bespoken to act a Play, at one of the
chiefest Citizens of <hi>Mans,</hi> who made a great Treat, and gave
a Ball at his Neece's Wedding, whose Guardian he had been.
The Assembly was kept at a very fair Country-House of his, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
a League from the City; but whether <hi>Eastward, Westward,
Northward,</hi> or <hi>Southward,</hi> I know not. The Decurator belonging
to the Strollers, and a Carpenter were sent in the Morning early to
make a Stage. The whole Company of Players follow'd after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
in two Coaches, about eleven a Clock, that they might
get thither by Dinner-time. <hi>Donna Inezilla</hi> the <hi>Spanish</hi> Lady,
made one, at the earnest intreaty of the Actresses and <hi>Rancour.
Ragotin</hi> being inform'd of the Business, went to an Inn at the end
of the <hi>Suburbs,</hi> where he waited the coming of the Coach, and
tyed a very fine Steed which he had borrow'd, to the Grate of
the Parlour that lookt into the Street. He was scarce set down
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:53808:58"/>
to eat his Dinner, when word was brought him, the Coach was in
sight. He flew to his Horse on the wings of Love, with a great
Sword by his side, and a Carabine dangling at his Breech like a
Bandoleer. He would never confess what his fancy was, to go
to a Wedding with such store of Offensive and Defensive Arms;
nor could <hi>Rancour</hi> his Confident ever persuade him to discover
it. By that time he had untied his Horses Bridle, the Coaches
were so near, that he had not the time to look for a Mounting-block,
that he might appear in State on his Steed like prety St.
<hi>George:</hi> And being none of the best Horsemen, and unprepar'd
to shew his nimble Disposition, he did it very aukwardly;
for his Horses Legs were as much too long, as his were too
short. However, he stoutly rear'd himself upon the Stirrup, and
threw his right Leg over the Saddle; but the Girts were loose
it seems, which occasion'd a strange Disaster; for this made the
Saddle turn round, while he was bestriding the Steed. Yet all
things went hitherto well enough, but the cursed Carabine which
hung on a Belt about his Neck like a Collar, got so unfortunate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
betwixt his Legs before he was aware, that his Breech could
not reach the Saddle, which was an old-fashion'd one, the Cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine
lying cross it from the Pummel to the Crupper. Thus he
was in a very uneasie Posture, as not being able with the tip
of his Feet, so much as to touch the Stirrups: Thereupon, his
Heels being arm'd with Spurs, kick'd the Horses side in a place
he was never us'd to be prick'd in, which made him start more
briskly, than was necessary for a little Rider in that Posture, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
nothing but the Carabine to rest upon. This made him
cling his Legs close to the Horses sides, which made the Horse
sling up his hinder Legs, and <hi>Ragotin</hi> following the Nature of
all heavy Bodies, fell into the Horses Neck, where he got <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>
bruised Nose, the Steed lifting up his Head suddenly at a jet
with the Bridle he gave him very preposterously: Now think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to repair his Oversight, he let go the Reins, and gives the
Horse his Head, which at that very instant gives a great lea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

his Horse, and something of the like Nature which
hapned to Rocquebrune.</head>
                  <p>WE left <hi>Ragotin</hi> planted on the Pummel of a Saddle, not
knowing how to behave himself, and much perplex'd how
he should come off. I scarce believe that the Defunct <hi>Phaeton</hi>
of unhappy Memory, was more troubled with his Father's four
fiery Steeds, than was at this time our little Lawyer, with this
one Horse as quiet as a Lamb; and that it did not cost him his
Life, as it did <hi>Phaeton,</hi> he was beholding to Fortune for it, whose
Capricies were a fit Subject for me to Expatiate on, were I not
in Conscience oblig'd to release <hi>Ragotin</hi> from the imminent Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
he was in; having besides, many more things to Treat of,
concerning our Strollers, during their Residence at <hi>Mans.</hi> As
soon as the Disastrous <hi>Ragotin</hi> felt what an uneasie Cushion he
had under the two most fleshy parts of his Body, on which he
us'd to sit, as all other Rational Creatures are wont; I mean,
as soon as he found how narrow his Seat was, he quitted the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
like a Man of Discretion, and laid hold of the Horse's Mane,
who ran away at full Speed. Thereupon the Carabine went
off: <hi>Ragotin</hi> thought he was shot thorough the Body, his Horse
undoubtedly believ'd the same, and made such a foul stumble,
that <hi>Ragotin</hi> lost his Seat; insomuch, that for a time, he hung
by the Horses Mane, with one Foot entangled by the Spur in
the Saddle-cloth; and the other Foot with the rest of his Body,
hanging towards the Earth in expectation of a Fall, as soon as
his Spur should break loose; together with his Sword, Carabine,
and Bandeleer. At length the Foot was disingag'd, his Hands
let go the Mane, and down he tumbled, thô with more grace
and skill, than he got up. All this happen'd in sight of the
Coaches, that stopt on purpose to see what would become of
him; or rather to have the pleasure of Laughing at him. He
cursed the Horse, who stood stock still, as soon as he had laid
down his Load: But to Comfort him, they took him up into
one of the Coaches in the Poet's Room, who was willing to ride,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hat he might flutter about the Coach, and Court <hi>Inezilla,</hi> who
at in the Boot. <hi>Ragotin</hi> resign'd his Sword and Fire-Arms up
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:53808:59"/>
to him, which he put on as dexterously, as any Son of <hi>Mars.</hi>
He lengthned <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>e Stirrups, fitted the Bridle, and without doubt
went to get up more Methodically than <hi>Ragotin.</hi> But surely there
was some Spell cast upon that unlucky Horse that Day, for the
Saddle being too loosely girted, as before, turn'd round with
him, as it had done with <hi>Ragotin;</hi> and the string of his Bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
being broken, the Horse ran a pretty way with him, whilst
he had but one Foot in the stirrup, his other serving the Horse
as a fifth Leg, and his back-parts expos'd to the view of all the
Assistants, his Breeches dangling all the way at his Heels. None
of the Spectators did Laugh at <hi>Ragotin</hi>'s Mishap, because they
were afraid he would hurt himself; but <hi>Rocquebrune</hi>'s Accident
was attended with loud shouts and laughter from the Coaches:
The Coachmen stopt to laugh their Belly-full, and all together
hollowed at <hi>Rocquebrune,</hi> which drove him into a House for
shelter, leaving the Horse to his own Discretion, who very wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
walk'd back again to the Town. <hi>Ragotin</hi> knowing he was
Responsible for the Beast, alighted out of the Coach and went
after him; then the Poet having cas'd up his Posteriors, return'd
into the Coach much troubled, and very troublesom to the rest,
by <hi>Ragotin</hi>'s Martial Equipage, who had undergone this third
disgrace in his Mistresses presence, with which we shall conclude
the twentieth Chapter.</p>

                  <p>THE Players were very well receiv'd by the Master of the
House, who was a good honest Man, and one of the most
considerable in those Parts. They had two Chambers allotted
them to lay their Cloaths in, and make themselves ready for the
way, which was put off till after Supper. They likewise <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

in private, and after Dinner, those that had a mind to walk
had the choice of a Grove and a fine Garden. A young Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellor
of the Parliament of <hi>Rennes,</hi> and near Kinsman to the Ma|
ster of the House, Accosted our Players, having discover'd <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiny</hi>
to be a Person of more than Vulgar Judgment, and the
Actresses, besides their great Beauty, to be such as could say
more than just the Parts they had learnt by heart. They Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:53808:59"/>
of things agreeable to their Profession, as Plays, and
Dramatick Writers. This young Counsellor said amongst other
things, that there was scarce any Remarkable Subject for the
Stage, that had not been blown upon; that all History was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
exhausted, and that Modern Authors would be at last
constrain'd to wave those nice Rules of Unity of Times, and
stretch it beyond four and twenty Hours: That the generality
did not apprehend what those severe Rules of the Stage are good
for, being rather pleas'd with Action and Representation than
Recitals; and therefore such Plots might be contriv'd as would
meet with Applause, without either falling into the Extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> or being tied up to the strict Precepts of
<hi>Aristotle.</hi> From Plays, they began to talk of Romances. The
Counsellor said, that nothing could be more Diverting, than
our Modern Romances; that the <hi>French</hi> alone knew how to
write good ones; but however, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
Talent to compose little Stories, which they call <hi>Novels;</hi>
that are more useful, and more probable Patterns for us to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
than those imaginary Heroe's of Antiquity, who grow
sometimes tedious and troublesom, by being overcivil and virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.
In short, that those Examples which may be imitated, are
at least as profitable, as such as do exceed all probability and
belief; from all which he concluded, that if a Man could write
as good <hi>Novels</hi> in <hi>French,</hi> as those of <hi>Michael de Cervantes,</hi> they
would soon be as much in Vogue, as ever Heroick Romances
have been. <hi>Roquebrune</hi> was not of the same Opinion: He said
very positively, that there could be no Pleasure in reading of
Romances, unless they contain'd the Adventures of Princes, Nay,
and of great Princes too, and that for that reason, <hi>Astrea</hi> only
pleas'd him here and there. And in what Histories can one find
Kings and Emperors enough to make new Romances, said the
Counsellor: We must feign such, replied <hi>Roquebrune,</hi> as they
usually do in fabulous Stories, which have no Foundation in Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story.
I perceiv'd then, return'd the Counsellor, that <hi>Don Quix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ot</hi>
is very little in your Favour? 'Tis the silliest Book that ever
I read, replied <hi>Roquebrune;</hi> tho' it be cried up by a great many
Men of Wit. Have a care, said <hi>Destiny,</hi> it be not rather for
want of Wit in you, than any Defect in the Book, that makes
you entertain so indifferent an Opinion of it. <hi>Roquebrune,</hi> would
not have fail'd to answer <hi>Destiny,</hi> had he but heard what he
spoke: But he was so taken up with telling his Feats to some
Ladies, who were come near the Players, that he minded him
not, and promis'd that fair Sex, he would write a Romance in five
Parts, every Part to contain five Volumes, which should eclipse
all the <hi>Cassandras, Cleopatras,</hi> and <hi>Cyrus</hi>'s, tho' this last have the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:53808:60"/>
Sir-Name of the <hi>Grand,</hi> as well as the Son of <hi>Pepin.</hi> In the
mean time the Counsellor was telling <hi>Destiny</hi> and the Actresses,
that he had writ some Novels in imitation of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising
he would communicate 'em to them. Thereupon <hi>Inezella</hi>
told them, in a kind of <hi>French</hi> that had more of the <hi>Gas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con</hi>
than of the <hi>Spanish,</hi> that her first Husband had the Name
of a competent Writer in the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
several Novels that were much esteem'd; some of which
she had in Manuscript, which in her Opinion, deserv'd to be
Translated into <hi>French.</hi> The young Counsellor being very cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
of such kind of Compositions, told the <hi>Spanish</hi> Lady, she
would do him a great favour in letting him have the perusal of
'em; which she very civilly granted; adding withal, that no
Body was better stor'd with Novels than her self; for as some
Women in their Country, will sometimes try to write both in
Verse and Prose, so she had made it her Pastime, and could en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
'em with some of her own making. <hi>Roquebrune</hi> confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently,
according to his Custom, offer'd to turn 'em into <hi>French.
Inezella,</hi> who was perhaps the sharpest <hi>Spaniard,</hi> that ever came
over the <hi>Pirenees</hi> into <hi>France,</hi> replied, that it was not only requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
to understand the <hi>French</hi> Tongue well, but that he must be
equally Master of the <hi>Spanish</hi> also; and therefore she could
not give him her Novels to Translate, till she was so well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with the <hi>French</hi> Tongue, as to be able to judge whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he was qualified for the Undertaking. <hi>Rancour,</hi> who had
been silent all the while, said, there was no doubt to be made of
his Ability, since he had been Corrector of a Printing-House:
He had no sooner popp'd out these words, but he remembred
<hi>Roquebrune</hi> had lent him Money, which made him pursue his Jest
no farther; to which the other, dash'd out of Countenance at
<hi>Rancour</hi>'s Words, reply'd, that he could not deny but that he had
corrected some few sheets, but then 'twas nothing but what he
had publish'd of his own. Madam <hi>Star,</hi> to shift the Discourse,
told <hi>Donna Inezella,</hi> that since she knew so many stories, she would
often Importune her to Relate some of 'em. The <hi>Spanish</hi> Lady
replied, she was ready to give her Satisfaction presently: They
took her at her Word, and all the Company seating themselves
round about her, she begun a story, not in the very same Terms
as you will find in the following Chapter; but yet so intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
as made 'em guess she was Mistress of a great deal of Wit
in <hi>Spanish,</hi> since she shew'd so much of it in a Language, to whose
Delicacies she was a perfect stranger.</p>

                  <p>A young Lady of the City of <hi>Toledo,</hi> Nam'd <hi>Victoria,</hi> des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended
from the Ancient Family of <hi>Portocarrero,</hi> had retired
her self to a House she had on the Banks of <hi>Tagus,</hi> about half a
League distant from <hi>Toledo,</hi> in the absence of her Brother, who
was a Captain of a Troop of Horse in the Low-Countries. She
became a Widow at seventeen Years of Age, being
Wedded to an old Gentleman that had got a great Estate in the
<hi>Indie</hi>'s, who six Months after his Marriage, perish'd in a Storm
at Sea, leaving much Wealth to his Wife. This fair Widow af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Death of her Husband, kept House constantly with her
Brother, where she liv'd in such Repute, that at the Age of Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
all the Mothers propos'd her for a Pattern to their Children,
the Husbands to their Wives, and the Lovers to their Desires,
as a Conquest worthy of their Ambition. But as her Retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
cool'd the Love of many, so on the other hand it encreas'd
the Esteem the whole World had for her. In this Country-house,
she enjoy'd at Liberty all the Innocent Pleasures of a rural Life,
when one Morning her Shepherds brought into her House a
couple of Men, whom they found stript of all their Cloaths,
and bound fast to a Tree, where they had been tied the whole
Night. They had lent each of them a scurvy shepherd's Coat
to cover themselves withal; and in this fine Equipage they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
before the fair <hi>Victoria.</hi> The poverty of their Habit did
not hide from her the Noble Mien of the younger, who made
her a genteel Complement, and told her he was a Gentleman of
<hi>Cordove, Don Lopaz</hi> of <hi>Gongora</hi> by Name; who was Travelling
from <hi>Sevil</hi> to <hi>Madrid</hi> about Business of great Importance, and
having overstay'd his time at Play, about half a days Journey
from <hi>Toledo,</hi> where he dined the day before, the Night sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd
them; and both he and his Men falling asleep, expecting
a Mule-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>ver who staid behind, some Thieves finding them
both in that condition, tied them to a Tree, having first stript
them to their very shirts. <hi>Victoria</hi> doubted not the Truth of his
Relation, his good Mien speaking in his Favour; and however
'twas a great piece of Generosity, to relieve a stranger reduced
to this sad Extremity. It happen'd by good luck, that amongst
the Cloaths her Brother left in her Custody, there were some
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:53808:61"/>
Suits, for the <hi>Spaniards</hi> never part with their old Cloaths,
though they make new ones. They chose the finest, and that
which fitted best the Masters shape; and his Man was also
Cloathed with what they could find next at hand. Dinner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
being come, this Stranger whom <hi>Victoria</hi> invited to her
Table, appear'd so Accomplish'd, and entertain'd her with so
much Wit, that she thought that the Relief the afforded him,
could never have been better bestow'd. They convers'd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the remaining part of the Day, and were so much taken
with each other's Perfections, that neither of them slept so qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly
that Night, as they did before. The Stranger would needs
send his Man to <hi>Madrid,</hi> to fetch him some Money, and buy
him Cloaths, or at least he pretended it; but the fair Widow
would not suffer him, promising to lend him so much as would
carry him to his Journeys end. He made some Overtures of
Love to her the very same day, and she gave him a favourable Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.
In fine, in a Fortnight's time, the Opportunity of the
Place, the equal Merit of these two Persons, a great many
Oaths and Vows on one side, too much Frankness and Credulity
on the other, a promise of Marriage offer'd, and their Recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal

and <hi>Victoria</hi>'s Waiting-woman, made her commit a Fault she
was thought uncapable of, and put this happy Stranger in Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
of the most Beautiful Lady of <hi>Toledo.</hi> For eight days to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
it was nothing but Love and Dear, Fire and Flame's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
these two Lover's. But now part they must, and Tears
succeed: <hi>Victoria</hi> indeed had right to stay him, but the Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
pretended he lost a great deal by not going; however, that
since he had been so happy as to win her Heart, he cared no more
either for his Law-suit at <hi>Madrid,</hi> or his Preferment at Court,
she then was eager to have him gone; her Passion having not blinded
her Reason so much, as to prefer the Pleasure of his Society, to
his Advancement. She got new Cloaths made for him and his
Man at <hi>Toledo,</hi> furnish'd him with as much Money as he desir'd;
and so he set forward on his Journey to <hi>Madrid,</hi> Mounted on
a good Mule, and his Man on another; the poor Lady full of
real Grief at his Departure, and he was no less Afflicted, or at
least pretended to be so, with the greatest Hypocrisie in the
World. The same day he took his Journey, the Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid
making his Bed, found a Picture-case wrapt in a Letter;
she carried it immediately to her Mistress, who found in the
Case the Picture of a most Beautiful young Lady, and reading
the Letter, it contain'd these Words, or others to the same

most intolerably. Miserable, abandon'd Woman that I am,

of her Marriage.) Have I thus long been so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

refus'd so many Men of Quality of my Acquaintance, who
would have thought themselves too happy in my Enjoyment, to
throw my self away upon a stranger, who perhaps laughs at
my easie Credulity; now he has ruin'd my Fame, and made
me for ever Miserable? What will they say at <hi>Toledo?</hi> And what
will they say in all <hi>Spain?</hi> Can a young, base, cheating Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tender,
be Discreet? Why did I let him know I lov'd him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I was assur'd of the sincerity of his Heart? Could he have
chang'd his Name, if he had meant to keep his flattering Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises?
Or can I hope after all this, he will not Reveal his easie
Conquest over me? What will not my Brother be provok'd to
do against me, by what I have done against my self? And to
what purpose is he courting Glory and Fame in <hi>Flanders,</hi> whilst
I Disgrace him in <hi>Spain?</hi> No, no, <hi>Victoria,</hi> thou must do any
thing to repair this Crime: But before I proceed to Vengeance,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:53808:62"/>
and desperate Remedies, I must try to regain by my Craft,
what I have lost by my Imprudence: It will be then time enough
to use desperate Ways, when I have found all others ineffectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al.
<hi>Victoria</hi> had it seems, a great Spirit, and Presence of Mind,
since she could fix on such a good Resolution in such a Plunge.
Her old Gentleman-Usher, and her Waiting-woman, would
have given her Advice: But she told 'em, she knew as much as
they could say, and that Action, and not Words, must now do
her Business. So the very same day, a couple of Carts were
laden with Household-stuff and Necessaries, <hi>Victoria</hi> giving out,
amongst her Domestick Servants, that she had pressing Business
concerning her Brother, which call'd her to Court. She took
Coach with her Squire and Woman, and hastened to <hi>Madrid,</hi>
whither her Goods were appointed to follow. As soon as she
Arriv'd, she enquir'd for <hi>Don Pedro de Sylva</hi>'s House, and being
inform'd where abouts it was, hired one for her self in the same
Street. Her Gentleman-Usher's Name was <hi>Rodrigo Santillane,</hi>
who from his Youth was bred up by <hi>Victoria</hi>'s Father, which
made him love his Mistress, as if she had been his own Sister.
Having much Acquaintance in <hi>Madrid,</hi> where he had spent his
youthful Days, he soon discover'd that <hi>Don Pedro de Sylva</hi>'s
Daughter, was to be Wedded to a Gentleman of <hi>Sevil,</hi> Named
<hi>Ferdinand de Ribere,</hi> which Match was made up by a Cousin of
his of the same Name, it being so near the Conclusion, that
<hi>Don Pedro</hi> was already providing Servants for his Daughter.
The very next day <hi>Rodrigo Santillane,</hi> in a plain and decent
Garb, <hi>Victoria</hi> in the Habit of a Widow of a mean Condition,
and <hi>Beatrix</hi> her Waiting-woman, who was to personate his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-in-Law,
and <hi>Rodrigo</hi>'s Wife, went all together to <hi>Don Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dro</hi>'s,
and desir'd to speak with him. <hi>Don Pedro</hi> receiv'd them
very Civilly, to whom <hi>Rodrigo</hi> said with much assurance, that
he was a decay'd Gentleman of the Mountains of <hi>Toledo,</hi> and
having one only Daughter by his first Wife, which was <hi>Victoria,</hi>
whose Husband died not long since at <hi>Sevil,</hi> finding his own,
and his Daughters Fortune very low, he had brought her to
Court to get some good Service for her; and being inform'd
that he was about setling his Daughter's Family at her Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
he hoped he would not take it unkindly, that he came to
proffer the young Widow's Service to him, she being a Person
very fit to be a <hi>Duegna</hi> to the Bride; adding, his Daughter's
Merit gave him the Confidence to present her to him, not doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her Breeding and good Nature, would give her a little better
Title to her Mistresses Favour, than the small Beauty she had to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
her. Before I proceed any farther, I must adveri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="4 letters">

keep <hi>Duegnas</hi> in their Houses, and those <hi>Duegnas</hi> are much the
same thing as our <hi>Governantes</hi> or Ladies of Honour belonging to
great Persons: I must add to this, that the <hi>Duegnas</hi> or <hi>Duegnes</hi>
in <hi>Spain,</hi> are severe and troublesom Animals, no less dreadful,
than a Domineering Mother-in-Law. To go on with the story,
<hi>Rodrigo</hi> plaid his part so well, and <hi>Victoria</hi> so Beautiful as she
was, appear'd so agreeable in her modest and plain Attire, and
had such a promising Look in her Face, that <hi>Don Pedro de Sylva</hi>
accepted of her immediately to govern his Daughter. He
proffer'd <hi>Rodrigo</hi> and his Wife an Employment in his House like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise;
but <hi>Rodrigo</hi> excus'd himself, and told him, he had some
Reasons not to accept of the Honour he intended him; but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a House in the same Street, he would be ready to wait
upon him at any time he should command it. Thus was <hi>Victoria</hi>
entertain'd in <hi>Don Pedro</hi>'s House, infinitely belov'd both by him
and his Daughter, and no less envied by all the other Servants.
<hi>Don Antonio de Ribera,</hi> who had contriv'd the Match between
his Faithless Cousin, and <hi>Don Pedro de Sylva</hi>'s Daughter, came
often to bring <hi>Don Pedro</hi> News, that his Kinsman was on his
Journey, and had written to him at his setting forth from <hi>Sevil.</hi>
And yet this Cousin did not appear: This very much perplex'd
him, nor could <hi>Don Pedro</hi> and <hi>Elvira,</hi> tell what to judge of it;
but <hi>Victoria</hi> was the most concern'd. However, <hi>Don Ferdinand</hi>
was not able to come so soon: For the very same day he parted
from <hi>Victoria,</hi> Heaven punish'd his Treachery. As he Arriv'd at
<hi>Illescas,</hi> a fierce Dog running out of a House unawares, affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his Mule so terribly, that his Leg was sorely bruis'd against
a Wall, and he thrown down, and his Knee put out of Joint,
which pain'd him so much, he could not prosecute his Journey.
He was seven or eight days under the Surgeons Hands, who
were none of the most Skillful, and his Ailment growing worse
and worse, he at length acquainted his Cousin with his Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune,
desiring him withal to send him a Horse-Litter. The
News of his Fall afflicted 'em no less, than the knowledge of
his being so nigh pleas'd them. <hi>Victoria,</hi> who still lov'd him,
was not a little Disquieted. <hi>Don Antonio</hi> sent a Letter to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey
<hi>Don Ferdinand</hi> to <hi>Madrid,</hi> where being Arriv'd, whilst
they were providing Cloaths for him and his Retinue,
which was very Magnificent, he being the Eldest Son of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
and wealthy enough, the Surgeons of <hi>Madrid,</hi> more
Skilful than those at <hi>Illescas,</hi> cured him perfectly well. <hi>Don
Pedro de Sylva,</hi> and his Daughter <hi>Elvira,</hi> had notice given 'em
of the day whereon <hi>Don Antonio de Ribera,</hi> was to bring his
Cousin <hi>Don Ferdinand</hi> to them. It is probable the young <hi>Elvira</hi>
did not neglect her self, nor was <hi>Victoria</hi> without Concern, She
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:53808:63"/>
saw her faithless Lover make his Entrance, trickt up like a Bride<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

what must he be now in his Wedding-Cloaths? <hi>Don Pedro</hi> was
very well satisfied with him, and his Daughter must have been
very nice, had she not been fully pleas'd. All the Servants of
the House stared with open Eyes upon their young Lady's Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom,
and every one of the Family, was over-joyed excepting
poor <hi>Victoria,</hi> whose Heart was opprest with Grief. <hi>Don Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand</hi>
was charm'd with <hi>Elvira</hi>'s Beauty, and confest to his Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sin,
that she was still more Beautiful than her Picture. His first
Complements express a great deal of Wit, and he very skilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
avoided those impertinent Fooleries, and starch'd Nonsense,
most Men are guilty of, in their first Addresses to a Father-in-Law,
and a Mistress. <hi>Don Pedro de Sylva</hi> lockt himself up in a
Closet with the two Kinsmen and a Lawyer, to adjust somwhat
that was left unfinished in the Articles. In the mean time <hi>Elvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi>
staid in her Chamber, surrounded with her Women, who all
exprest their Joy at the good Mien, and Noble Air of her Lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er:
Only <hi>Victoria</hi> stood cold and silent, whilst the rest were in
their Raptures. <hi>Elvira</hi> observed this, and took her aside to tell
her, she admired she said nothing of the Happy Choice her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
had made of a Son-in-Law, who seem'd so Deserving:
Adding, that either out of Complaisance or Civility, she ought
at least to wish her Joy. Madam, replied <hi>Victoria,</hi> your Lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er's
Mien speaks so much to his Advantage, it were needless to
add my Commendations. The Coldness you have taken notice
of, does not proceed from any indifference; and I were unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of the Favours you have vouchsafed me, should I not share
in every thing that concerns you; and therefore I should be no
less Transported with Joy at your Marriage, than all the rest
about you are, were I not so well acquainted with the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
you are to Wed. My own Husband was an Inhabitant of
<hi>Sevil,</hi> whose House was not far from your Lover's. He is, I
confess, of a good Family, Rich, Handsom, and I do believe,
a Man of Wit. In fine, he is worthy of a Lady, such as you
are. But withal, you desire a Man's entire Affection, which he
cannot bestow on you, because his Heart is divided. I could
wave a Discovery, which may perhaps Displease you: But I
should be wanting to my Duty, should I not Reveal all I know
of <hi>Don Ferdinand,</hi> in a Business which so nearly concerns the
Happiness or Unhappiness of your whole Life. <hi>Elvira</hi> was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maz'd
at her <hi>Duegna</hi>'s Words, and intreated her, not to defer
any longer the clearing those Doubts she had started. <hi>Victoria</hi>
replied, that it was neither to be done before her Women, not
in few Words. <hi>Elvira</hi> pretended she had some Business of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacy
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:53808:63"/>
in her Chamber, where <hi>Victoria</hi> as soon as they were alone,
told her: That <hi>Ferdinand de Ribera</hi> was in Love at <hi>Sevil,</hi> with
one <hi>Lucretia de Monsalva,</hi> a very Beautiful Lady, tho' of a very
mean Fortune, by whom he had three Children, upon promise
of Marriage; and that during <hi>Ribera</hi>'s Father's Life, it was kept
very secret, after whose Death, <hi>Lucretia</hi> having claim'd his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
he grew very indifferent; whereupon she had left the Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to the Management of two Gentlewomen, her Relations, which
made so much noise in <hi>Sevil,</hi> that <hi>Don Ferdinand,</hi> by his Friends
persuasion, absented himself for a time, to shun the Rage of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretia</hi>'s
Kindred, who sought for Blood and Revenge. In this
posture were his Affairs; added she, when I left <hi>Sevil,</hi> which
is about a Month agoe, at which time it was also reported, that
<hi>Don Ferdinand</hi> was going to <hi>Madrid</hi> to be Married. <hi>Elvira</hi> could
not forbear asking, whether that <hi>Lucretia</hi> were a greater Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?
<hi>Victoria</hi> told her, she wanted nothing but a Fortune, and
so left her extream pensive; and firmly resolv'd, to give instant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
her Father an account of the Discovery. At the same Moment,
she was call'd to entertain her Lover, the Business for which he
retir'd into the Closet with her Father, being concluded. <hi>Elvira</hi>
went to him, whilst <hi>Victoria</hi> staid in the Withdrawing-Room,
where the same Fellow came to her that attended on him, when
she so generously receiv'd them into her House near <hi>Toledo.</hi>
This Servant brought a Packet of Letters for his Master, which
he had taken up at the Post-Office from <hi>Sevil,</hi> and not knowing
<hi>Victoria,</hi> so much her Widows Weeds Disguis'd her, he desired
to be admitted to the speech of his Master, to deliver him the
Letters. She told him, it would be a good while before he could
conveniently speak with him; but if he durst trust her with she
Packet, she would be sure to give it him as soon as possibly she
could get to him. The Fellow made no scruple in the Case, and
having left the Packet in her Custody, went about his Business
<hi>Victoria,</hi> who was resolv'd to leave no stone unturn'd, goes up
to her own Chamber, opens the Packet, and in a Moment seal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

it up again, together with a Letter of her own, which she writ
in hast. In the mean time, the two Kinsmen made an end of
their Visit, and took their Leave. <hi>Elvira</hi> spying the Letters in
her Governant's Hands, ask'd what it was? <hi>Victoria</hi> coldly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd,
that <hi>Don Ferdinand</hi>'s Servant had left some Letters with
her, to deliver to his Master, which she was going to send after
him, not being in the way when he went out. <hi>Elvira</hi> said, it
would give 'em some further Light about the Discovery she had
made. This being what she desir'd, <hi>Victoria</hi> breaks open the

                     <hi>Elvira</hi> having read this Letter, was persuaded of the Truth
of what her Governante had told her. Moreover she shew'd it
to her Father, who could not but admire, that a Gentleman of
his Quality should be so base, as to be Treacherous to a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of equal Birth with him, after he had so many Children
by her. Thereupon he went to a Gentleman of <hi>Sevil</hi> for
further Information, being a Friend of his, and one that had
before given him an account of <hi>Ferdinand</hi>'s Wealth and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances.
He was scarce gone out of Doors, when <hi>Don Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand</hi>
came to inquire for his Packet, attended with his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
who told him, his Mistresse's Governante had promis'd
to deliver them into his Hands. He found <hi>Elvira</hi> alone in
the Parlour, and told her, that though the Engagement which
was between her and him, might excuse two Visits in one
day; yet he only came for the Letters his Man had left with
her <hi>Duegns. Elvira</hi> freely told him, that she had taken then
from her, and had the Curiosity to break them open; no
doubting but a Man of his years, had some Amorous Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in so great a City as <hi>Sevil;</hi> and though her Curiosity
yielded her but little Satisfaction, yet she had met with the
Caution in Recompense; how dangerous it was for People
to be Married together, before they were thoroughly acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with each other; adding, she would not debar him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

it was a Trick to hinder his Marriage.
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:53808:64"/>
He address'd himself to <hi>Victoria,</hi> who remain'd in the outward
Room, and told her without taking much notice of her Face,
that either some Rival, or malicious Person had contriv'd that
Letter to abuse him. I a Wife in <hi>Sevil!</hi> cry'd he with Amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
I Children! if this be not the most impudent Imposture
that ever was set on <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

told him he might possibly be innocent; but however <hi>Elvira</hi> in
Discretion could do no less than make a farther enquiry into the
Truth of it; and therefore the Marriage would certainly be put
off, till her Father <hi>Don Pedro</hi> could be convinc'd by a Gentleman
of <hi>Sevil,</hi> his Friend, (whom he was gone to seek on purpose;)
that this was only a pretended Intrigue. With all my Heart,
answer'd he; and if there be but a Lady of the Name of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretia
de Monsalva</hi> in all <hi>Sevil,</hi> let me forfeit the Honour and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
of a Gentleman: And let me intreat you, added he, to
let me know, if you are so far in your Lady's Favour as I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
you to be, that I may bespeak your good Offices on this
Occasion. Truly answer'd <hi>Victoria,</hi> I believe, without Vanity,
that she will not do a thing upon any Body's Account, that she
has refus'd to do on mine: But withal, I know her Humour is
such, that she is not easily appeas'd, when she thinks her self
disoblig'd: And as all the hopes of mending my Fortune de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
on the Kindness she has for me, I shall never offer to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
her out of Complaisance to you, nor hazard her Displeasure
by endeavouring to work her out of the ill Opinion she has of
your Sincerity. I am but poor, added she, and not to get any
thing were to lose a great deal: If what she had promis'd to
give me in case I marry a second time, should fail, I might live a
Widow all the rest of my Days, though I am yet young enough,
and not so deform'd but that some body or other may like me.
But 'tis an old Saying, and a true one, <hi>That without Money—</hi>
She was thus going on with a true <hi>Governante</hi>'s tedious Tale;
for to act<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Don Ferdinand</hi> interrupring her, said: Do me but one piece of
Service I shall require of you, and I will put you above the
Hopes of your Mistress's Reward: And, added he, to convince
you that my Promises are not empty Words, give me Pen, Ink
and Paper, and you shall have what you will under my Hand.
Jesu! Signior, says the feign'd Governante, a Gentleman's
Word is as good as his Bond—But to obey you (I will
fetch you what you desire. She return'd again with Materials
enough to have drawn a Bond of a Million of Gold, and <hi>Don
Ferdinand</hi> was so Gallant, or at least had such a Months mind
to <hi>Elvira,</hi> that he signs her a Blank, leaving her to fill it as she
pleas'd, thereby to engage her to serve him with greater Zeal.
This rais'd <hi>Victoria</hi> up to the Clouds: She promis'd Wonders to

                     <hi>Don Ferdinand,</hi> and told him she wish'd her self the unhappiest of
all her Sex, if she did not act in this Business, as if she her self
was a Party concern'd. And in this she spoke a great Truth.
<hi>Don Ferdinand</hi> left her full of Hopes; and <hi>Rodrigo San<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Thanks to Heaven with her, finding all things seem'd to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
to her Happiness. To lose no time, he went home to
the House that <hi>Victoria</hi> had hir'd, not far from <hi>Don Pedro</hi>'s, as I
before related, where he had fill'd up the Blank <hi>Don Ferdinand</hi>
had given (with a Promise of Marriage attested with Witnesses,
and dated about the same time that <hi>Victoria</hi> receiv'd this faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
Man into her Country-House. He was as skilful a Pen-man
as any in <hi>Spain,</hi> and had studied <hi>Don Ferdinand</hi>'s Hand so well
in a Copy of Verses of his own Writing, which he left to <hi>Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi>
that <hi>Don Ferdinand</hi> himself would have been mistaken in the
Forgery, and thought it to be his own Hand. <hi>Don Pedro de Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va,</hi>
could not meet with the Gentleman he sought to be inform'd
about <hi>Don Ferdinand</hi>'s Amours, but left a Note at his House, and
came back to his own; where that same Night <hi>Elvira</hi> unbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som'd
her Secrets to her Governante, and vow'd she'd sooner
disobey her Father, than ever to marry <hi>Don Ferdinand,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing
withal, that she was pre-ingaged to one <hi>Don Diego de Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radas</hi>
a long while before, and had in all reason complied
enough with her Father's Commands and her own Duty, by
putting a Constraint on her own Inclinations, to satisfie him;
but since Heaven had order'd it so, that <hi>Don Ferdinand</hi>'s Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery
was discover'd, she thought, by refusing him, she did obey
the Decrees of Heaven, which seem'd to allot her another Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.
You may imagine <hi>Victoria</hi> fortified <hi>Elvira</hi> in these good
Resolutions, and spoke quite contrary to <hi>Don Ferdinand</hi>'s Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations.

Father; wherein she entreated 'em to repair to her House about
Business, with the Direction where she dwelt, and subscribed her
self, <hi>Victoria Portocarrero.</hi> Whilst they were carrying these Notes,
<hi>Victoria</hi> strips off her Black Weeds, put on very rich Clothes,
pulls out her Locks, (which I have been told were of the finest
Hair that could be) and dress'd her Head as nicely as if she was
going to Court. <hi>Don Diego de Maradas</hi> came in a while after, to
know what Concern a Lady, to whom he was a perfect Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
might have with him. She receiv'd him very civilly; and
they were scarce set down, when it was told her, that <hi>Don Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dro
de Sylva</hi> was come to wait upon her. She intreated <hi>Don
Diego</hi> to conceal himself in her Alcove, assuring him, it concern'd
him very much to hear the Discourse she should have with <hi>Don
Pedro.</hi> He easily comply'd with the Desire of a Lady of so much
Beauty, and so good Mien, and <hi>Don Pedro</hi> was admitted into
<hi>Victoria</hi>'s Chamber, not knowing her, so much had her Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress
and rich Attire chang'd her Face, and heightned her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestick
Air. She desir'd him to place himself in a Chair, whence
<hi>Don Diego</hi> could easily hear all they said, and then began in
these Words: I think, Sir, I ought in the first place to inform
you who I am, because in all probability you are impatient to
know it. I am of the Family of the <hi>Portocarrero's,</hi> born in the
City of <hi>Toledo,</hi> where I was married at the Age of Sixteen, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
a Widow about six Months after. My Father was a Knight of
the Order of St. <hi>Iames,</hi> and my Brother of the Order of <hi>Callatra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>
Don Pedro</hi> interrupted her, to let her know her Father was
his intimate Friend. What you tell me, rejoices me extreamly;
answer'd <hi>Victoria,</hi> for I shall have occasion for a great many
Friends in the Affairs I design to acquaint you with. After this
he inform'd <hi>Don Pedro</hi> of all that pass'd between her and <hi>Don
Ferdinand,</hi> and put into his Hands the Promise of Marriage
counterfeited by <hi>Santillane.</hi> He had no sooner read it, but she
went on thus: You know, Sir, what Honour obliges Persons of
my Quality to do in these Cases: For though Justice should
be partially denied me, yet have my Friends so much Power and
Credit, that they would prosecute my Interest to the highest. I
thought Sir, it became me to let you know my Pretensions, that
you might put a stop to the Match you had design'd for your
Daughter. She deserves better than to be thrown away upon a
faithless Man; and I believe you are so discreet, as not to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate
in giving her a Husband, whom another has right to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute
with her. Were he a Grandee of <hi>Spain,</hi> replied <hi>Don Pedro,</hi>
I would have nothing to do with him if he were unjust and false;
I shall therefore not only deny him my Daughter, but my House;
And as for your self, Madam, both my Friends and Interest are at
your Service. I had notice given me before, that he was a Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                     <pb n="114" facs="tcp:53808:66"/>
that follow'd his Pleasure, even at the Expence of his Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and being of that Humour, though you had no Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
to him, he never should have my Daughter, who. I hope
in God, shall not want a Husband in the Court of <hi>Spain. Don
Pedro</hi> took his leave of <hi>Victoria,</hi> seeing she had no more to say
to him; and then <hi>Victoria</hi> call'd <hi>Don Diego</hi> out of the Alcove,
where he overheard all the Conversation she had with her Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress's
Father. This spar'd her the Labour of repeating her Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:
She deliver'd <hi>Elvira</hi>'s Letter to him, which transport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him with Joy; and lest he should be in Pain to know how
she came by it, she entrusted him with her Metamorphosis into a
<hi>Duegna,</hi> knowing he was as much concern'd as her self to keep
it socret. <hi>Don Diego,</hi> before he left <hi>Victoria,</hi> wrote an Answer
to his Mistress's Letter, wherein the infinite Joy he express'd for
his reviv'd Hopes, plainly discover'd the real Affliction he had
been in ever since he thought them quite lost. He parted from
the fair Widow, who presently put on her Governantes Habit,
and return'd to <hi>Don Pedro</hi>'s. In the interim <hi>Don Ferdinand de
Ribera</hi> was gone to wait upon his Mistress, and had taken his
Cousin <hi>Don Antonio</hi> along with him to endeavour to set all that
to rights again, which had been charg'd against him by <hi>Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi>'s
feign'd Letter. <hi>Don Pedro</hi> found'em with his Daughter,
who knew not what to answer, when they both desir'd no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Justification, than only a due Enquiry, whether there ever
were in <hi>Sevil</hi> such a Lady as <hi>Lucretia de Monsalvo.</hi> They repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the same Plea to <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> to clear <hi>Don Ferdinand;</hi> to
which he answer'd: That if that Engagement with the Lady of
<hi>Sevil</hi> was a Supposition, it was so much the easier defeated; but
that he came from a Lady of <hi>Toledo,</hi> nam'd <hi>Victoria Porto-ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to whom <hi>Don Ferdinand</hi> had promis'd Marriage, and to
whom he was still more engag'd, having been so generously as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
by her, when a meer Stranger to her; which he could no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

deny, since she had under his Hand and Seal a Promise of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
from him; adding, a Person of Honour ought not to
court a Wife at <hi>Madrid,</hi> whilst he had one already at <hi>Toledo:</hi>
At these Words he shew'd the two Cousins the Promise of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
in due Form. <hi>Don Antonio</hi> knew his Cousin's Writing
and <hi>Don Ferdinand</hi> mistaking it, though he were confident he had
never given any, was quite confounded at the sight of it. The
Father and the Mother withdrew, after they had coldly bid them
adieu. <hi>Don Antonio</hi> quarrell'd with his Cousin for employing
him in this Treaty, when he had another on foot before. They
took Coach together, where <hi>Don Antonio</hi> having made him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
his unhandsom Proceeding with <hi>Victoria,</hi> reproach'd him a
Thousand times with the Heinousness of the Fact, and represe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to him the evil Consequence that was like to attend it. He
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:53808:66"/>
told him, he must not think of getting a Wife, not only at <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid,</hi>
but in any part of <hi>Spain;</hi> and that he were happy if he
could get off by marrying <hi>Victoria,</hi> without forfeiting his Life with
his Honour, <hi>Victoria</hi>'s Brother being a Person not us'd to put
up so foul a Business without full Stisfaction. It was <hi>Don Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand</hi>'s
Part to be silent, whilst his Cousin continued his Reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.
His Conscience sufficiently accus'd him of Treachery and
Falshood against a Lady that had so highly oblig'd him; but this
Promise of Marriage almost distracted him, not knowing by
what strange Inchantment they had made him grant it. <hi>Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi>
being come back to <hi>Don Pedro's</hi> in her Widow's Weeds, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd
<hi>Don Diego</hi>'s Letter to <hi>Elvira,</hi> who told her how the two
Kinsmen had been there to justifie themselves; but that <hi>Don
Ferdinand</hi> was charged with other-guess Practices, than his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
with the Lady of <hi>Sevil;</hi> she afterwards related what
<hi>Victoria</hi> knew better than her self; though she pretended to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
and detest <hi>Don Ferdinand</hi>'s Baseness. That same Day <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vira</hi>
was invited to a Play at one of her Relations. <hi>Victoria,</hi>
whose Thoughts still ran upon her own Affairs, hop'd, if <hi>Elvira</hi>
would follow her Counsel, that this Play would prove favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to her Design. She told her young Lady, that if she had a
mind to meet her Lover <hi>Don Diego,</hi> there was nothing more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,
her Father's House being the most convenient that could be;
and that since the Play was not to begin till Midnight, she might
go out a little earlier, and have time enough to speak with <hi>Don
Diego,</hi> and then go to her Relations. <hi>Elvira,</hi> who really lov'd
<hi>Don Diego;</hi> and had consented to marry <hi>Don Ferdinand,</hi> only
out of Respect to her Father's Command, shew'd no Reluctancy
to do whatever <hi>Victoria</hi> propounded. Wherefore they took
Coach as soon as ever <hi>Don Pedro</hi> was gone to Bed; and went to
<hi>Victoria</hi>'s House. <hi>Santillone,</hi> as Master of the Family, and <hi>Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix,</hi>
who personated the Mother-in-Law, welcom'd them very
civilly. <hi>Elvira</hi> wrote a Billet to <hi>Don Diego,</hi> which was deliver'd
immediately; whilst <hi>Victoria</hi> dispatched another privately away
to <hi>Don Ferdinand</hi> in <hi>Elvira</hi>'s Name; to let him know it was in his
Power to compleat the March, on which his extraordinary Merit
engag'd her to adventure, as not desiring to make her self unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
for ever by losing him, only to please a Father's crabbed su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicious
Humour. In the same Note she gave him such parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Directions to find the House, that it was impossible he
should miss of it: Which Note was carried a little while after
that other from <hi>Elvira,</hi> to <hi>Don Diego. Victoria</hi> wrote a third
likewise, which <hi>Santillane</hi> carried himself to <hi>Don Pedro de Syl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>a,</hi>
and by which she inform'd him, as a trusty Governante, that his
Daughter, instead of going to the Play, would needs stop at her
Father's House, and had sent for <hi>Don Ferdinand</hi> to consummate
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:53808:67"/>
her Marriage with him; which she believing to be against his
Consent, she though her self bound to give him notice of it,
that he might know he was not at all mistaken in the good Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
he entertain'd of her Honesty, when he chose her to be his
Daughter's Governante. <hi>Santillane</hi> likewise told <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> his
Daughter had charg'd him not to come thither by any means
without bringing an <hi>Algouazil</hi> along with him, which is an Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer
much like a <hi>Commissary</hi> in <hi>Paris. Don Pedro</hi> being in Bed,
hasten'd to put on his Clothes in a great Passion. But whilst he
is dressing himself, and sending for a <hi>Commissary,</hi> let us go back
and see what they are doing at <hi>Victoria</hi>'s. By good Fortune the
Notes came safe to the Brace of Lovers Hands. <hi>Don Diego,</hi> who
had receiv'd his first, came likewise first to the Assignation. <hi>Victoria</hi>
met him at the Door, and conducted him into a Chamber,
where she left him with <hi>Elvira.</hi> I will not trouble you with the
Relation of all the Endearments which pass'd betwixt these
young Lovers; and if I would, <hi>Don Ferdinand</hi>'s knocking at the
Door gives me not time enough. <hi>Victoria</hi> lets him in her self,
after having magnified the great Service she did him on this Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion;
for which the Amorous Spark return'd her a Thousand
Thanks, promising he would yet do more for her than all his
former Promises engag'd him to. She leads him into a Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
where she desir'd him to stay a while for <hi>Elvira,</hi> who was
coming, and so lock'd him in without any Light; telling him,
his Mistress would needs have it thus; but that 'twould not be
long before he should be visible again; adding, a young Lady's
Modesty would not suffer her to bear, without blushing, the Sight
of him for whom she did so bold an Action. This done, <hi>Victoria,</hi>
with all the haste she could, attired her self as well and as nicely
as the short time would admit. She goes into the Chamber where
<hi>Don Ferdinand</hi> was, who had not the least Suspicion but that
she was <hi>Elvira,</hi> being no less young than she, and having Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumes
about her, according to the <hi>Spanish</hi> Fashion, as would
have made a Chamber-maid pass for a Woman of Qual<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ty.
Thereupon <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> the <hi>Algouazil,</hi> and <hi>Santillane</hi> arrive. They
enter the Chamber where <hi>Elvira</hi> was in private with her Lover;
at which they both were not a little surpriz'd. <hi>Don Pedro</hi> was
blinded by the first Transports of his Passion, that he was ready
to run the Person thro' the Body with his Sword, whom he, took
for <hi>Don Ferdinand.</hi> The <hi>Commissary</hi> discovering it was not he but
<hi>Don Diego,</hi> held back his Arm, bidding him have a care what he
did, since it was not <hi>Don Ferdinand de Ribera</hi> that was with his
Daughter, but <hi>Don Diego de Maradas,</hi> a Person of as great Quality
and Riches as he. <hi>Don Pedro</hi> at this behav'd himself like a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet
Gentleman, and rais'd up his Daughter, who had cast her self
upon her Knees at his Feet. He wisely consider'd, that if he
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:53808:67"/>
should cross her Inclination, by opposing this Match, he would
create both her and himself a great deal of Trouble; and besides,
that he could not pitch upon a better Son-in-Law, if he had had
the chusing of him himself. <hi>Santillane</hi> desir'd <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gouazil,</hi>
and all those that were with 'em in the Room to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
him, and led them to the Chamber where <hi>Don Ferdinand</hi> was
shut up with <hi>Victoria.</hi> They commanded the Door to be open'd
in the King's Name: <hi>Don Ferdinand</hi> letting them in, and seeing
<hi>Don Pedro,</hi> attended with the <hi>Commissary,</hi> told them, with a great
deal of Confidence, that he was with his Wife <hi>Elvira de Sylva.
Don Pedro</hi> answer'd, he was mistaken, his Daughter being mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
to another; and as for you, added he, you cannot deny but
<hi>Victoria Porto-carrero</hi> is your lawful Wife. <hi>Victoria</hi> then undisco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
her self to her faithless Gallant, who remain'd full of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion.
She expostulated his Ingratitude; to which his Silence
was his only Plea, as well as to the <hi>Commissary,</hi> when he told him
he could do no less than carry him away to Prison. In short, his
Romorse of Conscience, and fear of Imprisonment, together with
<hi>Don Pedro</hi>'s Exhortations, who minded him of his Honour and
Reputation, joyn'd to <hi>Victoria</hi>'s Tears and Beauty, nothing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior
to <hi>Elvira</hi>'s, and above all the rest, some Sparks of Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rosity
still remaining in his Heart, notwithstanding his Debauche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
and Follies of Youth, made him yield to Reason and Justice,
and <hi>Victoria</hi>'s bright Charms. He tenderly embrac'd her, she
being likely to swoon in his Arms, which no doubt but his warm
Kisses preserv'd her from. <hi>Don Pedro, Don Diego,</hi> and Fair <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vira</hi>
shar'd in <hi>Victoria</hi>'s Happiness, and <hi>Santillane</hi> and <hi>Beatrix</hi> were
ready to die for Joy. <hi>Don Pedro</hi> very much commended <hi>Don Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand</hi>
for thus nobly repairing the Wrongs he had committed. The
two young Ladies embrac'd each other with as great Testimonies
of Love, as if they had hugg'd their own Husbands. <hi>Don Diego
de Maradas</hi> made a Thousand Protestations of his Obedience to
his Father-in-Law, or he that should be so in a short time, <hi>Don Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dro,</hi>
before he went home with his Daughter, made them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
that they should all come and dine the next Day at his House,
where for fifteen Days following, he would endeavour by solemn
Rejoycings, to dispel the Thoughts of their past Troubles. The
<hi>Algouazil</hi> was invited too, who promis'd to be there: <hi>Don Pedro</hi>
took him along with him; and <hi>Don Ferdinand</hi> remain'd with <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoria,</hi>
who now had as much Reason to bless her good Fortune,
as she formerly had to curse it.</p>

was so pleas'd with it, that he caught up her Hand, and
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:53808:68"/>
kist it whether she would or no. She told him in <hi>Spanish, That
Great Men and Fools have the liberty to do any thing;</hi> for which <hi>Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour</hi>
gave her Thanks in his Heart. This <hi>Spanish</hi> Lady's Face be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to break, yet there were many fine Remains of her former
Beauty to be seen. But had she been less handsom, her Wit made her
to be preferr'd to a younger Person. All those that heard the Story
agreed in this, that she had made it very entertaining in a Language
she was but yet a Novice in, being oftentimes oblig'd to intermix
<hi>Spanish</hi> and <hi>Italian</hi> with it to express her Meaning. Madam <hi>

told her, that instead of begging Excuse for putting her to the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of speaking so long, she expected her Thanks for giving her so
fair an Occcasion to shew her extraordinary Wit. The rest of the
Afternoon was spent in Conversation the Garden being full of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
and many Citizens of Note till Supper-time. They supp'd af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the way of <hi>Mans;</hi> that is to say, they made very good Chear;
which being over, every one took their Places to see the Play:
But Madam <hi>Cave</hi> and her Daughter were missing. They sent to
seek them out; and it was half an Hour before any Tidings came.
At last they heard a great noise without the Hall; and presently
after in comes Madam <hi>Cave,</hi> with dishevelled Hair, her Face
bloody and bruis'd, crying out, like a distracted Creatute, that
her Daughter was stollen away. Her Sobs and Sighs did so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt
her Speech, that it was a long time before she could make
'em understand how a couple of Strangers, being through a Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>door
got into the Garden, where she and her Daughter were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearsing
their Parts, one of 'em seiz'd upon her, whose Eyes she'd
almost scratcht out of his Head, seeing two others take away her
Daughter by force; the same Villain having put her into that sad
Condition they saw, and afterwards, mounting on Horseback,
follow'd his Comrades, one of whom held <hi>Angelica</hi> before him,
She told 'em likewise, that she pursu'd 'em as far as she could,
crying out, a Rape; but finding no Body was within hearing,
she hasted back again to the House to beg their Assistance.</p>
                  <p>With these last words, she shed such a Flood of Tears, as
mov'd all the Beholders with Pity. <hi>Destiny,</hi> got presently on
the back of a Horse, on which <hi>Rogatin</hi> was just Arriv'd from
<hi>Mans,</hi> (but whether or no it was the same that threw him in the
Morning. I cannot justly tell.) Many other young Men moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Horses they could lay their Hands on, and rode after
<hi>Destiny,</hi> who was got a good way before 'em. <hi>Rancour</hi> and
<hi>Olive</hi> march'd on Foot, with their Swords in their Hands, in
the Rear of the Horse; and <hi>Roquebrune</hi> staid with <hi>Star</hi> and <hi>Ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zilla,</hi>
who were endeavouring to Comfort <hi>Cave</hi> as well as they
could. Some found fault with him, for not going along with

have commended his Discretion, for staying with the

Women. In the mean time, the Guests were reduc'd to change
their Comedy for Dancing, and having no Fidlers, because they
expected a Play, they trip'd about, by the singing of some of
the Company. Poor <hi>Cave</hi> found her self <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

desir'd her to make the Door fast, and come to her Bed-side.
<hi>Star</hi> having seated her self as she desir'd, the first thing she did,
was to Weep afresh, and then she laid hold of her Hands, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

return, said she: Weeping still more and more, I wish she might
never be found, repeated she again, and that this were all my
Grief: But I must blame her most; Nay, I must have her;
and curse the hour I brought her into the World. Look here I
said she, putting a Paper into <hi>Star's</hi> Hands: Look and satisfie

if a Father, who loves his only Son more than his own Life,
do not quickly condescend to all his desires, to make him return again.</p>
                  <p>Well, said <hi>Cave,</hi> what think you now of your Companion,
and your Brother's Servant? What think you of that Girl, I
had bred up with so much Care; and that young Fellow, whose
Wit and Discretion we so often admired? My greatest Wonder
is, that they were never observ'd to speak to one another; and
that my Daughter's sprightly Humour, seem'd not in the least
to encline her to Love: And yet she's in Love, my Dearest,
<hi>Star,</hi> and so desperately, that it argues as much of Madness, as
of Affection. I found her this very day writing to her <hi>Lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
in such passionate Expressions, that if I had not Surpriz'd
her my self, I could never have believ'd it. You never heard
her speak such Language yet: Ah! had I not torn her Letters
in my Fury, you would be convinc'd that at Sixteen years old,
she knows as much, as those who have practis'd Cocquetry all
their Lives-time. I carried her aside into the Grove, whence
she was taken from me, to chide her for the ill return she made
me, for all the Pains and Trouble I have endur'd on her Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.
I will acquaint you with my Sufferings, added she, and
then judge you, whether ever any Daughter were more oblig'd
to love her Mother. <hi>Star</hi> knew not what to answer to these
just Complaints; and besides, 'twas Wisdom to let her Affliction
take its course. But, continu'd <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

<pb n="146" facs="tcp:53808:72"/>
not have found in all the strolling Companies of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
two Women more Vertuous than They. Not but that
some of that Profession are Vertuous, but according to the
general Opinion of the World, who perhaps may be mistak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en,
they are more light of Vertue, than of old Embroidery or
Paint. To go on with our proper Business: Our Generous
Stroller gallop'd after those Ravishers, with more Swiftness
and Animosity than the <hi>Lapithae</hi> after the <hi>Centaurs.</hi> He went
first of all through a long Walk, into which opened the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den-door,
at which <hi>Angelica</hi> was carryed away, and having
gallop'd a little while, he struck at a venture into a little hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
Lane, as are most Lanes in <hi>Mayne.</hi> This Lane was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
full of Wheel-tracts and Stones, and tho' 'twas Moon-shine,
yet the Darkness was such, that <hi>Destiny</hi> could not perswade his
Steed to go faster than a broken Pace. He was inwardly
Cursing this crabbed Way, when he felt either a Man or a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Leaping on Horseback behind him, and Clasping his Hands
about his Neck. <hi>Destiny</hi> was terribly Frighted, and his Horse
so much Startled, that he had thrown off his Rider, had not
the Phantom who invested him within his Arms, kept him
firm on the Saddle. His Horse rode away with him, like a
Horse in a Fright, and <hi>Destiny</hi> put him on with his Spurs,
not knowing what he did, very much dissatisfied, to feel two
naked Arms about his Neck, and next his Cheek a cold Face,
which blew in time with the cadence of the galloping Nag.
The Race prov'd long, because the Lane was not a short one;
At last, at the entrance into a Heath, the Horse abated his
impetuous Course, and <hi>Destiny</hi> his Fear; for Custom brings us
by degrees to bear with the most intolerable Evils. The Moon
now shone with a clearer Light, on purpose to let him see, that
he had a great Man stark Naked behind him, and a very home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Face next his. He did not ask who he was, (wheter
out of good Manners I cannot tell) but still kept his Horse on
the Gallop, tho' by this time he began to Breath short and thick,
and when he least expected it, the Hind-Rider dropt on the
Ground, and fell a Laughing. <hi>Destiny</hi> put on his Horse a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

main, and looking behind him, he saw his Phantom runing
as fast as he could drive towards the Place from whence he
came. <hi>Destiny</hi> confest since, that no Man can be more Fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
than he was at that time. About a Hundred Steps farther
he came to a great Road, that led him to a Hamlet, where
he found all the Dogs awake, which made him believe that
those he pursued might have gone that way. In order to b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of three or four Houses that stood on the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

prevail to be heard, but was insulted and bark'd at by the
Dogs. At last, hearing a Child cry in the last House he met
with; he caus'd the Door to be open'd with severe Threats;
and learnt of a Woman, trembling in her Smock, that some
Troopers were gone through their Town, carrying with them
a Woman who wept like a Child, and that they had much ado
to still her noise. He told the same Woman the Adventure
he had with the Naked-man, and she inform'd him, that he
was a Peasant of their Village who was run Mad, and rov'd
up and down. What this Woman told him about those
Troopers who went through that Town, encouraged him to
go farther, and made him request his Steed to mend his Pace.
I will not recount how often he Stumbled, and was Frighted
at his own Shadow: 'Tis enough to inform you, that <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiny</hi>
lost his Way through a Wood, and Riding sometimes
in the Dark, and sometimes in the Moon-shine, he at last met
with Break of Day near a Country Farm, where he thought

of those who had Stollen away <hi>Angelica, Rancour,</hi>
and <hi>Olive,</hi> who did not take that Rape so much to Heart,
did not run so fast as he after the Ravishers; and besides, you
must consider they were on Foot, therefore they did not go
far, and having found in the next Village, an Inn that was
open, they went in, and ask'd for a Bed. The House being
almost full; they were shewn a Room, where lay one, (ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a Gentleman or a Plebian) who had Supp'd in the Inn,
and being upon Business which required haste, (but which
never came to my Knowledge) reckon'd to be gone at Break
of Day. The Arrival of our Strollers did not favour his
Design of getting betimes on Horseback; for they wak'd him
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ut of his first Sleep, for which perhaps he curst'em in his
Heart, but the sight of two Men that look'd like something;
was undoubtedly the Reason why he did not complain aloud.

                        </gap>ncour,</hi> who had an accostin Behaviour, first begg'd his
Pardon for their interrupting his Repose, and then ask'd him
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:53808:73"/>
from whence he came? He told them he came from <hi>Anjon,</hi>
and was going into <hi>Normandy,</hi> about a Business that requir'd
haste. <hi>Rancour</hi> went on with his Questions while he was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressing
himself, and the Sheets airing: But as they were
all impertinent, and of no use to either, especially to the poor
man whom they had waked, he was desired to forbear, and
suffer him to go to sleep. <hi>Rancour</hi> begg'd heartily his Pardon,
and at the same time Self-love banishing out of his Breast
the Love of his Neighbour, he resolved to appropriate to
himself a Pair of new Boots, which the Ostlers-boy brought
into the Room, after having clean'd them. <hi>Olive,</hi> who at
that time had only a mind to a sound Sleep, went into
Bed, whilst <hi>Rancour</hi> sat by the Fire, not so much to see the
Fagot they had lighted, burnt out, as to satisfie his Noble
Ambition, of having a new Pair of Boots at another Mans
Expence. Now assoon as he thought that the Man whom
he was going to rob, was fast asleep, he took his Boots
which stood at his Beds-feet, and having put them on vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Stockins, not forgetting the Spurs, he vvent thus Boot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and Spurr'd, into Bed to <hi>Olive.</hi> 'Tis probable he lay
as near the side of the Bed as he could, lest his armed Legs
should touch the naked ones of his Bed-fellovv, who would
undoubtedly have rais'd a Noise about this new Way of Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
betwixt two Sheets, and by that means make his Plot
miscarry. The remaining part of the Night was pretty
quiet: <hi>Rancour</hi> Slept, or at least dissembled Sleep: The
Cocks crew; Day came, and the Man who lay in the same
Room with our Strollers, order'd a Fire to be kindled, and
began to Dress himself. When he went to put on his Boots,
a Maid offer'd him <hi>Rancour</hi>'s old ones, which he flung down
with Contempt; the Maid obstinately maintain'd they were
his, whereupon he fell into a great Passion, and made a
devilish Noise. The Inn-keeper came up into the Room,
and Swore upon the Faith of an Honest Inn-keeper, that
there were no other Boots besides his own, not only in his
House, but also in all the Village, the Parson himself ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
going on Horseback. Thereupon he began to entertain
him with the good Qualities of the Parson, and tell him
how he came by his Living, and how long he was in Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
of it. The Inn-keepers idle Talk, made him lose all
Patience. Now <hi>Rancour</hi> and <hi>Olive,</hi> who waked at the Noise,
took cognizance of the Business; and <hi>Rancour</hi> exaggerated
the enormity and hainousness of the Fact, and told the Inn-keeper,
that 'twas a very Foul thing. I care no more for a
Pair of new Boots, than for an old Pair of Shoes, (said
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:53808:73"/>
the poor Bootless Man to <hi>Rancour,</hi> were it not that I am
upon a Business of great Importance, for a Man of Quality,
whom I'd chuse to serve before my own Father, and if I
could Buy other Boots, I'd give any Price for 'em, were
they never so bad. <hi>Rancour</hi> who sat on the Bed, shrugg'd
up now and then his Shoulders, and answer'd him nothing,
keeping his Eyes still fixt on the Inn-keeper and his Maid,
who lookt for the Boots to no purpose) and the Wretch that
lost them, who in the mean time did fret like a Mad man,
and perhaps design'd to Hang himself, when <hi>Rancour</hi> out of
an unexampled and unwonted Generosity, said aloud, and thrust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himself into the Bed, like one who is almost dead for
want of Sleep; Zounds, Sir, don't keep such a Noise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
your Boots, but rather take mine, upon Condition you
let us Sleep, which is no more than what you desired of me
last Night. The unfortunate Man, who now ceas'd to be
so since he found a Pair of Boots, had much ado to believe
his own Ears. He mustered a great deal of Nonsense to
return him Thanks, which he uttered with so passionate a
Tone, that <hi>Rancour</hi> fear'd lest he should come at last and
embracc him a bed. Wherefore he cryed out in a Passion,
and Swearing most learnedly: Zounds, Sir, what a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome
Man you are, both when you lose your Boots, and
when you thank those that furnish you again. Once more,
take mine in God's Name, and all I ask for 'em, is, that
you let me Sleep, or else give me my Boots back again,
and make as much Noise as you please. He begun to open
his Mouth in order to reply, when <hi>Rancour</hi> cry'd out, Good
God! let me Sleep, or let me have my Boots. The Inn-keeper,
who by this time had a great Respect for <hi>Rancour,</hi>
from this Imperious way of speaking, thrust his Guest out
of the Chamber, well knowing he would have the last,
like one who was highly thankful for a Pair or Boots so
generously given: However he was fain to leave the Room,
and go into the Kitchen to put on his Boots, at which time
<hi>Rancour</hi> began to Sleep with more Tranquillity than he had done
in the Night, his sleepy Faculty not being disturbed either by this
wakeful Desire of Stealing a Pair of Boots, or the Fear of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
taken in the very Fact. As for <hi>Olive,</hi> who had made a
better use of the Night, he got up betimes, call'd for some
Wine, and fell a Drinking, which was the best thing he could do.
<hi>Rancour</hi> slept till Eleven of the Clock, and as he was Dressing
himself, <hi>Ragotin</hi> came into the Room. He had been that
Morning visiting the Actresses at their Toilet, and Mistriss <hi>Star</hi>
having told him she had but little Reason to think him one of her
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:53808:74"/>
Friends, since he did not go after her Companion as well
as the rest, he promis'd not to return to <hi>Mans</hi> before he had
learnt News of her: But not finding a Horse, either for Love
or Money, he could never have kept his Promise, had not
his Miller lent him his Mule, which he mounted without
Boots, and so arrived (as I said before) at the Village where
the two Strollers had lain. <hi>Rancour</hi> had a strange ready
Wit; and so he no sooner saw <hi>Ragotin</hi> in Shoes, but he
thought Fortune favour'd him with an opportunity of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing
his Theft, which he was much in pain how to do.
Wherefore he presently desired him to lend him his Shoes,
and to take his Boots, which being new, did hurt one of his
Feet. <hi>Ragotin</hi> accepted his Proposal with much joy, for as he
was Riding on his Mule, the Tongue of the Stirrup-buckle
had torn his Stockins, which made him heartily wish for a
Pair of Boots. Now to acknowledge the Favour in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
he paid for the Players Dinner, as well as for his own
and his Mule's. And because since his late Fall, (when his
Carabine went off betwixt his Legs) he made an Oath ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to get upon the Back of any Saddle-Beast, without tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
care of his Safety, he therefore made use of a jossing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>block;
but yet with all this Precaution, he had much ado
to get into the Pack-saddle. His Brain was too full of Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silver
to be judicious; a sign of which was his turning up
the Tops of his Boots up to his Waste, which hindred him from
having the free use of his Hams, that were none of the most
vigorous in the Province, However <hi>Ragotin,</hi> mounted on his
Mule, and the Strollers on Foot, set forward on their Journery,
and followed the next Road they came at. As they were
going along. <hi>Ragotin</hi> opened his Mind to the Strollers, and
told them his Design of turning Player, and acting in their
Company, protesting withal, that tho' he did not doubt but
in a short time he would prove the best Actor in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
yet he did not expect any profit from his Profession,
and that he only did it out of Curiosity, and to let the World
know, that he was fit for any thing he had a mind to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake.
<hi>Rancour</hi> and <hi>Olive</hi> fortified him in his noble Design,
and what with Commending and Encouraging of him, they
put him into so good a Humour, that from his high Station,
he began to recite Verses out of <hi>Theophilus's Piramus</hi> and <hi>T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Certain Peasants who attended a loaden Cart, and were

the Lord; and as long as he rehears'd his Heroicks. they walk'd
Cap in Hand, and respected him like a High-way Preacher.</p>

                  <head type="sub">The History of Cave.</head>
                  <p>THE two Women-Strollers, whom we left in the
House, from whence <hi>Angelica</hi> was stollen away, had
no better Nights rest than Destiny. Mistriss <hi>Star</hi> went into
the same Bed with Mistriss <hi>Cave;</hi> both not to leave her
alone with her Despair, and to endeavour with gentle Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions
to alleviate her Affliction. At last finding that so
just a Grief did not want Reasons to defend it self, she us'd
no Arguments to oppose it; only to make a Diversion she
began to complain of her hard Fate, as much as her Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fellow
did of hers, and thus cunningly engag'd her to relate
her Adventures, the more easily, because at that juncture <hi>Cave</hi>
would not allow any Body to be more unfortunate than her
self. She therefore wip'd off those Tears that trickled down
her Cheeks in abundance, and fetching a sound and deep Sigh,
that she might not have the trouble to sigh again so soon; she
thus began to tell her Story. I was born a Player, Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to a Player, of whom I never heard that he had any
Relations but Players. My Mother was Daughter to a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
of <hi>Marseilles,</hi> who bestowed her in Marriage to my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as a recompense for venturing his Life, to defend his,
against a Gally-Officer (as much in Love with my Mother,
as he was hated by her) who had attack'd him to his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage.
This was an extraordinary good Fortune for
my Father; for without being put to the trouble of Suing,
and Wooing, he married a Wife Young, Beautiful and Richer
than a Stroller could ever pretend to. His Father-in-Law
endeavour'd to persuade him to leave his Profession, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
himself to the business of a Merchant, as the most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
and creditable of the two. But my Mother, who was
a great lover of Plays, hindred him from leaving the Stage;
tho' to give him his due, he was inclin'd to follow his Wife's
Fathers Advice, as one that knew much better than she, that
a Player's Life is not so happy as it appears to be. My Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
left <hi>Marseilles</hi> soon after his Marriage, carried away my
Mother to make her first Campagne, she being more impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
than he, and in a little time made an excellent Player of
her. She proved with Child the first Year of her Marriage
and was brought to Bed of me behind the Scenes; a Year after
I had a Brother whom I loved dearly, and by whom I was
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:53808:75"/>
much belov'd. Our Company was made up of our Family,
and of three Players, one of which had a Wife who acted
under Parts. Upon a Holy-Day we went through a small
Town in <hi>Perigord;</hi> my Mother, the other Player and I, on the
Cart that carried our Baggage, and our Men on Foot to Guard
us, when our little Caravan was attack'd by seven or eight
ugly Fellows, so very drunk, that meaning only to fright us with
shooting off a Gun, I felt their Shot all over me, and my
Mother receiv'd a dangerous Wound in the Arm. They
seiz'd my Father and two of his Companions before they were
able to defend themselves, and beat them unmercifully. My
Brother, and the youngest of our Men fled away, and ever
since I could never hear of my Brother. The Inhabitants of
the Town joined themselves to those who offered us this
outragious Violence, and caused our Cart to go back. This
eager Mobb ran fiercely like People who have got a great
Booty, and are willing to secure it, and made such noise that
they did not hear one another speak, After an Hours March
they carried us into a Castle, which we had no sooner en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
but we heard several People cry out with great Joy, that
the Gypsies were taken; by that we found their Mistake,
which gave us a little Comfort. the Mare that drew our Cart
fell down dead with weariness, having been hard put to it,
and soundly beaten. The Player to whom the Mare belonged,
and of whom the Company hired her, fell a roaring in as
lamentable a manner as if her Husband had been dying: At
the same time my Mother felt such violent Pain in her Arm,
that she fainted away, which made me roar so loud, that
my Cries drowned those of the Player, upon account of her
Mare. The noise we made, together with the hallowing
of the rude Rabble, and of the Drunken Scoundrels who
brought us thither, caused the Lord of the Castle to come
out of a Parlour attended with four or five ill-look'd Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
in Red-Coats or Cloaks. His first Question was, <hi>Where,
where are the thieving Gypsies?</hi> Which put us in a terrible
Fright; but seeing none but fair Faces among us, he then
askt my Father who he was, and had no sooner heard that we
were a wretched Company of Players, but with an impetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Passion, at which we all wonder'd, and Swearing in as
furious a manner as ever I heard a Man Swear, he charged
with his Sword those who had seised us, and caused them to
disappear in a Moment, some of them Wounded, and the
rest in a terrible Fright. The Mobb being thus dispersed,
he commanded my Father and his Companions to be untied,
the Women to be carried into a Room, and our Goods to
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:53808:75"/>
be laid up safe. Some Chamber-Maids came to wait upon us
and got a Bed ready for my Mother, who found her self very
ill of her Wound in her Arm. Soon after, a Man that looked
like a Steward came to express his Masters concern for the
rude usage we had received. He told us that the Scoundrels
who made so unlucky a Mistake, sneaked away most of
'em soundly beaten, or lame, and that a Surgeon was sent for
from the next Town <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o dress my Mothers Arm; afterwards
he asked us very earnestly, Whether they had taken any thing
from us, and advised us to view our Goods, and see if
there were any thing wanting. At Night they brought us
our Supper into our Room; the Surgeon came, my Mothers
Wound was drest, and she went to Bed in a violent Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.
The next Day the Lord of the Castle sent for the
Players, enquired of them how my Mother did, and told
them he would not suffer her to go out of his House before
she was perfectly recover'd. He was so obliging as to send
Men up and down the Country to enquire after my Brother
and the young Player, with whom he fled away, but they
could not be found; which Misfortune encreased my Mothers
Feaver, A Phisician and a Surgeon (more skillful than he
who drest her Wound first) were sent for from of a Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Town, and in a short time our good usage in the
Castle made us forget the Violence we had suffered. The
Lord at whose House we were entertain'd, was a very rich
Man, more fear'd than lov'd through all the Country; as
violent in all his Actions as a Governour of a Frontier Town,
and one who had the reputation to be as brave as <hi>Hercules.</hi>
His Name was the Baron <hi>de Sigognac;</hi> at this present time he
could be no less than a Marquiss, but in those Days he was
only a petty Tyrant of <hi>Perigord.</hi> A Company of Gypsies who
had lain in his Lordship, stole away some Horses out of a
Park where he kept Mares for breed, at a Leagues distance
from his Castle, and the Men that were sent to pursue them
mistook us for 'em, to our cost. My Mother being now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
well, my Father and his Companions to express their
Gratitude for their kind Entertainment, as far as poor Strol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
were able, offer'd to Act in the Castle as long as the
Baron <hi>de Sigognac</hi> would desire it. An over-grown Page, at
least Four and twenty Years of Age; who was undoubtedly
the Dean of all the Pages in the Kingdom, and a sort of
Gentleman Waiter, studied the parts of my Brother, and of
the Player with whom he ran away. And now busie Fame
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>roclaim'd through all the Country that a Company of Strol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rs
were to act a Play at the Baron <hi>de Sigognac</hi>'s; abundance
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:53808:76"/>
of <hi>Perigordine</hi> Gentry were invited to the Shew, and when
the Page was perfect in his Part, which he found so difficult
to learn, that they were fain to cut and reduce it to two
Lines, we acted <hi>Garnier</hi>'s <hi>Roger</hi> and <hi>Bradamante.</hi> The As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly
was very fine; the Room well lighted; the Stage
convenient, and the Scenes adapted to the Subject. We all
endeavour'd to do our best, and we acted with Applause.
My Mother in the Habit of an <hi>Amazon</hi> appeared as beautiful
as an Angel, and tho' her late Indisposition made her look
a little pale, yet the brightness of her Complexion obscur'd
all the Lights in the Room. Tho' I have great Reason to
be very Melancholy, yet I cannot forbear Laughing whenever
I think how ridiculosly the Page acted his Part; neither must
my ill Humour rob you of this pleasant Passage; perhaps
you may not find it such, but I can assure you that it made
all the Company laugh very heartily, and that I have laught
at it since, whether it be really laughable, or because I am one
of those who laugh at a very small Matter. He acted the
Page of the Duke of <hi>Aymon,</hi> and had but two Lines to speak
in all the Play, when the old Man reprimanded his Daughter
<hi>Bradamante</hi> for refusing to marry the Emperours Son, (because
she was in Love with <hi>Roger</hi>) the Page says to his Master.</p>
                  <l>Monsieur, rentrons dedans, je crains que vous tombiez,</l>
                  <l>Vous n'ètez pas trop bien assuré sur vos PIEDS.</l>
                  <p>This great Oaf of a Page, tho' his Part was easie enough
to remember, yet murder'd the second Verse, and said very auk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly,
and trembling like a Malefactor.</p>
                  <l>Monsieur, rentrons dedans, je crains que vous tombiez;</l>
                  <l>Vous n'ètes pas trop bien assuré sur vos IAMBES.</l>
                  <p>This false Rime surpriz'd every Body; he that acted <hi>Aymon</hi>'s
Part burst out a-laughing, and was not able to represent an
Angry old Man. All the Assistants laugh'd as well as he;
and I my self, who was then peeping through the Hangings
to see and be seen, laugh'd also to that degree that I was ready
to drop down. The Master of the House, who was one of
those Melancholy Persons who laugh but seldom, and never
at a small Matter, found his Page's want of Memory, and his
aukward way of reciting Verses so laughable a Subject, that
he was like to burst by endeavouring to preserve his Gravity;
but at last he was fain to laugh as well as the rest; and his
Men told us since, that they never knew him so well pleas'd
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:53808:76"/>
in all their Lives. Now as he was a Man of great Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
in that Country, there was not one Person in the whole
Audience that did not laugh as much as he, or perhaps more,
either out of Complaisance, or a natural Inclination. I am
very much afraid, added <hi>Cave,</hi> I have now done like those
who tell People, <hi>I'll tell you a Story that will make you die
with Laughing.</hi> and who seldom or never are as good as their
Word: For I must confess I rais'd your Expectation too high
about the silliness of my Page. Not at all, answered <hi>Star,</hi>
I have found it such as you made me expect it; 'tis true the
thing may have seem'd more ridiculous to those that saw
it, than it will to those who shall hear it related, the auk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardness
of the Page contributing much to make it such;
and besides, the Time, the Place, and the natural Inclination
we have to laugh for Company's sake, are all Advantages it
cannot have now. <hi>Cave</hi> made no further Apology, and resuming
her Story where she had left off: After, continued she, that
both the Actors and the Audience had laughed as much as
their risible Faculty would let them, the Baron <hi>de Sigognao</hi>
order'd his Page to come again on the Stage, in order to
mend his Fault, or rather to make new Sport for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany:
But the Page, (the greatest Looby that ever I saw)
refus'd to obey the positive Commands of the severest Master in
in the World. The Baron took his denial as he was prompted
by his hasty Temper, that is to say, very ill, and his Resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which ought to have been small, had he been rul'd by
Reason, prov'd afterwards the fatal Cause of the greatest Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune
that could befall us. Our Tragedy was honour'd
with the Applause of the whole Audience; and the Farce was
still better receiv'd than the Tragedy, as it generally happens
every where, except in <hi>Paris.</hi> The Baron <hi>de Sigognac,</hi> and
the rest of the Gentlemen his Neighbours, were so well
pleased with it, that they desired to see us act again. All the
Gentlemen clubb'd to make a Present to our Company, every one
according to his Generosity; the Baron shew'd them the
way, and the Play was given out for the next Holy Day.
We play'd a whole Month before this <hi>Perigordine</hi> Gentry;
during which time, we were Treated and Caress'd both by
Men and Women, and besides, our Company was presented
with some old Cloaths half worn out. The Baron enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
us at his own Table; his Servants were extreme offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
in waiting upon us, and told us often how much they
were oblig'd to us for their Masters good Humour, whom
they found quite alter'd since Plays had Civiliz'd his rough
Manners. The Page alone look'd upon us as People who
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:53808:77"/>
had blasted his Reputation for ever; and the Line he had spoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and which every Body in the House, to the very Scullion,
repeated to him ever and anon, was a cruel Stab to him, of
which he at last resolv'd to be reveng'd upon some body of
our Company. Upon a certain Day, when the Baron <hi>de
Sigognac</hi> had assembled his Neighbours and Tenants, to rid
his Woods of a great number of Wolves that Harbour'd
there, and by which the Country was very much annoy'd;
my Father and his Fellow-Strollers accompanyed him each
with his Gun, as did also his Servants. The unlucky Page
went along with them, and having found the opportunity he
lookt for, to put his ill Design against us in Execution, he
no sooner espyed my Father, and his Comrades separated
from the rest, and giving one another Powder and Shot to
load their Guns; but he let his Piecefly at them from behind a
Tree, and Shot my unhappy Father with two Bullets: His
Comrades were so busie in supporting him, that they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
thought at first to pursue the Murderer, who made the
best of his Way, and since ran the Country. Two Days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
my Father dyed of his Wounds: My Mother resented
her loss to that Degree, that it almost broke her Heart;
she fell Sick again, and I was as much afficted as 'twas
possible for a Girl of my Years. My Mother's illness prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a lingring Disease; the Men and the Women that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd
to our Company, took their Leaves of the Baron
<hi>de Sigognac,</hi> and went to seek their Fortune with some other
Strollers. My Mother lay sick for above two Months, but
she recovered at last, having during that time receiv'd such
Tokens of Generosity and Kindness from the Baron <hi>de Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gognac,</hi>
as were little to be expected from a Man who had
the Reputation of being the greatest Tyrant that ever made
himself fear'd, in a Country, where every Squire pretends to
huff and domineer, His Servants who never found any
Humanity or Civility in him before, wondred ro see him
Converse with us, in the most kind and obliging manner.
One might have thought he was in Love with my Mother,
tho' he seldom spoke to her, and never came into our Room,
(where we us'd to take our Meals, since my Fathers Death)
only he often sent to know how she did: However, the
Country did talk as if he was great with her, as we have
since been inform'd. But my Mother, considering she could
not with Decency stay any longer in the House of a Man
of his Quality, had already design'd to leave it, and retire
to her Fathers at <hi>Marseilles.</hi> She therefore acquainted the
Baron with it; return'd him Thanks for all his kind Usage
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:53808:77"/>
to us, and desired him to add a new Favour to all those
we had receiv'd from him, which was, to lend us Saddle-horses
for her self and me, till we came to a certain Town,
and a Cart to carry our little Baggage, which she design'd
to Sell to the first Man that would give her any thing for
it. The Baron was much surpriz'd at my Mothers Design,
Nor was she in a less surprize than he, finding he would
neither grant nor deny her Request. The next Day, the
Curate of one of the Churches within his Lordship, came to
Visit us in our Chamber, accompanied by his Neice, a good-natured
and agreeable Girl, with whom I was intimately
acquainted. She and I went out to fetch a Walk in the
Garden of the Castle, and left her Uncle alone with my
Mother: The Curate had a long Conversation with her,
and did not leave her till Supper-time. As I came back, I
found her Melancholy and full of Thoughts; and ask'd her
three or four times what the matter was, but could get no
answer from her, only she fell a Weeping, and so I Wept for
Company, not knowing why nor wherefore. At last, she bid
me shut her Chamber-door, and told me, (Weeping still more
than before) that the Curate had inform'd her, that the
Baron <hi>de Sigognac</hi> was desperately in Love with her, and
assur'd her besides, that he had so great a Respect for her,
that he never durst declare (by himself or others) his Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to her, without offering her Marriage at the same time.
Here she stopt, being almost suffocated with Sighs and Sobs:
I ask'd her once again, What ail'd her? What! Daughter,
said she to me, have I not said enough to let you understand
that I am the most wretched Woman in the World? I told
her I did not think it so great a Misfortune for a Player
to become a Lady of Quality. Alas! Dear Child, said
she, you speak like a young Girl that knows nothing of the
World. What, (added she) if he should deceive the Curate
in order to deceive me? If he does not design to Marry
me, as he would perswade me he does, have I not Reason to
fear all manner of Violence, from a Man so much a Slave
to his Passions? And if he really designs to Marry me.
and I consent to it, What Woman in the World can be
more Miserable than my self, when his Fancy is over? How
great is his Hate like to prove, if ever he should repent his
Loving me? No, no, my Daughter, Fortune is not so fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
to me, as thou imaginest: Nay, rather she designs
to aggravate my load of Woe; for having depriv'd me of a
Husband whom I lov'd, and by whom I was beloved, she
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ow would force one upon me, who perhaps will hate me,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:53808:78"/>
and oblige me to hate him too. Her Grief, which I thought
unreasonable, encreas'd to that degree, that she was like to be
stifled with it, whilst I helpt her to undress her self. I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted
her as well as I could, and endeavour'd to combate
her Affliction, with all the Arguments a Girl of my Years
was able to frame, not forgetting to tell her, that the oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and respectful Behaviour, which the roughest of all Men
had ever shewn in conversing with us, seem'd to be a good
Omen, and especially his want of Assurance in discovering
his Passion to a Woman, whose Profession is rather apt to
embolden a Man in his Addresses, than inspire him with aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Respect. My Mother suffer'd me to speak all I thought
fit, went to Bed very much afflicted, and cherish'd her Grief
all Night long, instead of Sleeping. I endeavoured for the
sake of good Manners, to resist Sleep, but at last I was fain
to yield, and so I Slept for us both; she got up early in the
Morning, and when I awak'd I found her ready Drest, and
her Mind pretty well compos'd. I was in great Pain to
know what Resolution she had taken, for to tell you Truth,
I flatter'd my self with my Mothers future Greatness, in
case the Baron was Sincere and Honourable in his Addresses,
and my Mother willing to grant his Sute. The Thoughts
of hearing my Mother call'd My Lady Baroness, filled my
Mind with Delight, and Ambition began to inflame my youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Breast—</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cave</hi> was thus recounting her Story, and <hi>Star</hi> listning to
her with great Attention, when they heard something tread
in their Chamber, which startled them the more, because they
remembred they had made the Door fast with the Bolt. The
Noise continued, and so they cry'd, Who's there. No an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
was made, but a moment after, <hi>Cave</hi> saw at the Beds-feet,
(the Curtains being open) the Figure of a Person whom
she heard Sigh, and who leaning on the Bed, rested on her
Feet. She sate up, to view nearer the thing that began to
Fright her, and fully resolved to speak to it, she reach'd her
Head out of the Bed, when the thing disappear'd. The be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in Company with any Body gives often an Assurance,
but sometimes our Fears are never the less for being shar'd
with another. <hi>Cave</hi> was frighted because she had seen no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
and <hi>Star,</hi> because she saw her Companion frighted.
They both thrust themselves into the Bed, cover'd their
Heads with the Bed-cloathes, and lay close together, not
daring almost speak to one another for Fear, At last <hi>Cave</hi>
said to <hi>Star,</hi> that her poor Daughter must be Dead, and that
'twas her Ghost that came to sigh by her, <hi>Star</hi> was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:53808:78"/>
going to Reply, vvhen they heard the Thing
vvalk again in the Room. <hi>Star</hi> thrusts her self deeper into
the Bed than she had done before; but <hi>Cave</hi> embolden'd
by the thought that it vvas her Daughters Ghost, she sat
up again in the Bed, and seeing the same thing appear,
sighing as before, and leaning on her Feet, reach'd her
Hand and felt a very rough one, which made her give
a hideous shriek, and struck her down with the fright. At the
same time they heard a barking in the Room, as when a Dog
is afraid of any thing that he meets in the Night. <hi>Cave</hi> had
once more Courage enough to look what it was, and then
she saw a great Grey-hound that barked at her. She threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
him with a loud Voice, at which time he retired barking
towards one corner of the Room, where he vanished out of
fight. The Couragious Player rose out of her Bed, and by
the Moon-shine which came through the Windows, she dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
in that corner of the Room, where the Phantom and
the Grey-Hound had disappear'd, a little Door which open'd
into a little pair of Back-Stairs. By that she easily imagin'd
that a Grey-hound belonging to the House was crept through
that Door into their Room; and that having a Mind to lay
himself on their Bed, but not daring to do it without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of those who were in it, he had sighed like a Dog, and
the Bed being high, as are all old Beds, he had lean'd his
fore-Legs on her Feet, and afterwards crept under the
Bed, when <hi>Cave</hi> first reached her Head cut of it: However
the belief of a Ghost being in the Room, had so possest
<hi>Star's</hi> frighted Soul, that 'twas a long time before she could
persuade her that 'twas but a Grey-Hound. As afflicted as
<hi>Cave</hi> was, she jeer'd her Companion about her Cowardise, and
reserved the continuation of her Story to another time, when
they should not want Sleep so much as they did then. 'Twas
now break of Day, they fell asleep, and got up about Ten o'th'
Clock, when Word was brought them, that the Coach which
was to carry them to <hi>Mans</hi> was ready to set out assoon as
they pleas'd.</p>

still enquiring after those he pursued, but could learn
no News, nor Tidings from 'em. Thus he rambled up and
down till Two or Three a Clock in the Afternoon, when
Hunger and his Horses weariness oblig'd him to return to a
great Village which he left a little while before. Here he
found a pretty good Inn, because it stood upon the Road,
and did not forget to ask them whether they had heard of
a Company of Horsemen who stole away a young Woman.
<q>There's above a Gentleman who can give you an account
of 'em,</q> said the Surgeon of that Village, who happen'd to
be there; <q>for, added he, I believe he has been a quarrelling
with 'em, and has got many a Wound for his Pains. I just
now applied to him an <hi>Anodyne</hi> and <hi>resolutive Cataplasm</hi> on a
<hi>livid Tumour</hi> he has on the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the Neck, and drest
a great cut he received in the <hi>Occiput.</hi> I would have let
him Blood, because he is full of <hi>Contusions,</hi> but he would
not let me, tho' he has great occasion for it. He must needs
have got a heavy fall, or else have been beaten unmercifully.</q>
This Country Surgeon took such delight in mustering the learned
Terms of his Art, that though <hi>Destiny</hi> was gone from him,
and no Body left to give him the hearing, he still went on with
his Discourse till he was fetch'd away to let a Woman Blood.

disorder'd at first: I am asham'd, (said he to <hi>Destiny</hi>)
I dealt not so frankly and sincerely with you, as I should
have done with one whom I value so much as I do you;
but you must excuse an unexperienc'd young Man, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he was well acquainted with you, thought you to be of
the same Make, as are generally those of your Profession, and
who upon that Score durst not trust you with a Secret, on
which depends the Happiness of his Life. <hi>Destiny</hi> told him,
he could not imagine in what particular he had distrusted
him, unless <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

things bendes to tell you, if so be you are not acquainted

know what brought you hither? <hi>Destiny</hi> told him how
<hi>Angelica</hi> was Stollen avvay; that he pursued her Ravishers,
and was inform'd as he came into the Inn, that he had
met with one, that could give him an account of them. 'Tis
true I met with 'em, (reply'd <hi>Leander</hi> with a sigh) and
that I did as much against 'em, as a single Man can do
against many; but my Sword happening to break in the
Body of the first Man I wounded, I could neither rescue
Mistriss <hi>Angelica</hi> nor die in her Defence, tho' I was fully
resolv'd to do either. They left me in the Condition you
see me in, and thinking they had killed me with a Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroke
I receiv'd on the Head, (but which did only stun me
for a while) they went on their way in great haste. This
is all I know about Mistriss <hi>Angelica,</hi> but we shall hear
more from a Servant who is to meet me here, and whom
I sent to follow 'em at a distance after he help'd me to
mount my Horse, which they left me, because I suppose they
did not think him worth Stealing. <hi>Destiny</hi> ask'd him why
he went from him without giving him Warning? From
whence he came? and Who he was? Not doubting but
he conceal'd his Name and Condition from him. <hi>Leander</hi>
confest there was some such thing, and having laid himself
down, because the Blows he receiv'd gave him a cruel Pain,
<hi>Destiny</hi> sat on the Beds Feet, and then <hi>Leander</hi> recounted

to Act: there I saw Mistriss <hi>Angelica,</hi> and fell in Love with her
to that degree, that I could mind nothing else. Nay, I went

bitterly the remaining part of the Day, and all the Night:
and the very next Morning changing Cloaths with my Man,
(who is about my Size) I left him at <hi>La Fleche</hi> to sell my
School-boys Equipage, and gave him a Letter for a Tenant
of my Fathers, who supplies me with Money whenever I ask
him for it, with orders to come to me at <hi>Angiers.</hi> I began
my Journey thither after you, and overtook you at <hi>Duretail,</hi>
where several Gentlemen who Hunted the Stag, oblig'd you
to stay seven or eight Days. There I offer'd my Service to
you, and you entertain'd me as your Man, either because
you was loth to be without one, or because my Face and
Mien, which you seem'd to like, engaged you to hire me.
My Hair which I cut very short, hindred me from being
known again by those who had often seen me with <hi>Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lica:</hi>
Besides, my Man's bad Coat, which I put on to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guise
my self, made me look quite another Man, from what I
look'd in my own Cloaths, which were finer than a School-boy's
generally are. However Mistriss <hi>Angelica</hi> knew me
at first sight, and own'd to me since, that she did not doubt,
but the Passion I had for her was very violent, since I aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd
all to follow her. She had the Generosity to disswade
me from it: And to recall my wandring Reason. She made
me feel those Rigours, which would have cool'd a Man less
Amorous than my self, but by my constant Love, I insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
engaged her, to Love me as much as I did her. As
you have the Soul of a Man of Quality, (of such a Man
of Quality I mean, as is truly Noble) 'twas not long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you found out that I had not the Inclinations of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant;
I soon gain'd your favour, and the esteem of all the
Gentlemen of your Company; nay <hi>Rancour</hi> himself did not
hate me, tho' he has the Reputation amongst you, to love
no body. I shall not waste much time in relating to you
all the fine Things, which two Persons equally in Love may
say to one another, as often as they happen to be toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
you know it well enough by your own Experience.
I will only tell you, that Mistriss <hi>Cave</hi> suspecting our private
Correspondence, or, rather having certain Proofs of it, charg'd
her Daughter never to speak to me; that her Daughter did
not obey her; and that having surpriz'd her Writing to me,
she us'd her so roughly, both before People and in private,
that since that time, I found no great difficulty in perswad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her to consent to be stollen away. I fear not to make
this plain Confession to you, knowing you to be as Gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
as any Man, and at least as Amorous as my self. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiny</hi>
blush'd at these last Words of <hi>Leander,</hi> who went on
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:53808:81"/>
with his Discourse, and told <hi>Destiny,</hi> that he left the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
in order to put his Design in Execution; that one of
his Fathers Tenants promis'd him to furnish him with a
Sum of Money, and that he hop'd to receive some at St.
<hi>Maloes,</hi> from a Merchants Son, his intimate Friend, who
was lately come to his Estate, by the death of his Parents.
He added, that by the assistance of this Friend, he hop'd to
go easily over into <hi>England,</hi> and from thence to make his
Peace with his Father, without exposing to his Anger, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Mistriss <hi>Angelica</hi> or her Mother, whom in all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
he would prosecute, with all the advantage that a Man
of Wealth and Quality may take over two poor Players.

                     </hi> made <hi>Leander</hi> sensible, that by reason of his Youth
and Quality, his Father would certainly have Indicted Mrs.
<hi>Cave</hi> for a Rape. He did not endeavour to make him for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
his Mistriss; for he was sensible, that Persons in Love, are
not capable to follow any Counsels but what are suggested
by their Passion, and are more to be pittied than to be blamed;
but he highly disapproved his Design of going over into
<hi>England;</hi> and represented to him what People might think
of two young Strangers in a foreign Country; the Hazards
and Fatigue of a Sea-voyage; the difficulty of being sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
with Money, in case he should want, and lastly, the
Attempts to which they would be exposed by Mistriss <hi>Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lica</hi>'s
Beauty, and the Youth of both. <hi>Leander</hi> did not endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to defend a bad Cause: He ask'd once more <hi>Destiny</hi>'s Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
for having conceal'd himself so long from him; and
<hi>Destiny</hi> promis'd him to use all the Interest he had with
Mistriss <hi>Cave,</hi> to incline her to be favourable to him. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
he told him, that if he was fully resolv'd never
to marry any Woman but Mistriss <hi>Angelica,</hi> he ought not to
leave their Company, adding, that in the mean time his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
might die, or his Passion abate, or perhaps, be quite
extinguish'd—Oh! never, never, cry'd <hi>Leander.</hi> Well
then, (said <hi>Destiny</hi>) to secure your Mistrisses Heart, your best
way is never to lose Sight of her. Be a Player with us, for
you are not the only Man that treads the Stage, when he
could follow a better Employment. Write to your Father;
make him believe you are in the Army, and try to get
Money from him; in the mean time I will converse with you
as if you were my own Brother, and by that means endeavour
to make you forget the indifferent Usage you receiv'd from
me, whilst I was unacquainted with your Quality and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.
<hi>Leander</hi> would have thrown himself at his Feet, if the
violent Pain he felt all over his Body from his Bruises, would

have let him: However, he return'd him Thanks in so oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a manner, and made him such hearty Protestations of
Friendship, that from that moment he had as great an esteem
for him as one Gentleman can have for another. They Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours'd
afterwards, which Way they should go in Search of
<hi>Angelica;</hi> but a great Noise interrupted their Conversation,
and caus'd <hi>Destiny</hi> to go down into the Kitchen, where was

                  <p>TWO Men, one of which was in Black like a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
School-Master, and the other in Gray, who look'd
like a Catch-pole, laid hold of one another by the Hair and
the Beard, and now and then Box'd one another in a most
cruel manner. Both were indeed what their Habits and their
Looks shew'd 'em to be: He in Black, the School-master
of the Town, Brother to the Curate; and the other in Gray,
a Bailiff of the same Town, and Brother to the Inn-keeper.
This Inn-keeper was then in a Chamber next to the Kitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en,
ready to give up the Ghost; being Sick of a violent
Feaver, which so disorder'd his Senses, that he broke his
Head against the Wall; and this Wound join'd to his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper,
brought him so low, that when his Frenzy left him,
he was fain to part with Life, which perhaps he regretted
less than his ill-gotten Money. He had been a long time a
Soldier, and was at last come home, loaden with Years, and
so light of Honesty, that he might be said to have less of
it than Money, altho' he was extraordinary Poor. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
Women are very often catch'd by those very things they
ought least to be catch'd by; his twisted Hair, longer than
any Peasants in Town, his Cursing and Swearing like a true
Son of <hi>Mars,</hi> a bristling Feather which he wore on his Hat
upon Holy-days, when the Weather was Fair, and a rusty,
long Sword that flap'd against the old Boots he had on, altho'
he never bestrid a Horse, all these I say, gain'd him the
Heart of an old Woman that kept an Inn. She had been
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:53808:82"/>
Courted by the richest Tenants in the Country, not so much
on account of her Beauty, as because she got an Estate with
her first Husband, by exacting upon People, and cheating in
the Measure, both of Wine and Oats; yet she couragiously
resisted all the Assaults of her Woers, but at last, an old<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beaten

Warriour, without acquainting her Relations with it, and

a broken Scull, which she look'd as a just Judgment upon
him, for his repeated Attemps of breaking hers. When <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiny</hi>

the old Curate of the Town to part the Combatants, who
grappled one another like two Ships in a Sea-fight; but the
Threats of <hi>Destiny,</hi> and his Magisterial way of speaking
brought about what the Curate's Exhortations could not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form,
and the two mortal Enemies let go their hold, spitting
half of their bloody Teeth out of their Mouths, bleeding at
their Noses, and their Hands full of Hair both from their
Head and Beard. The Curate being an Honest, Well-bred
Man, return'd <hi>Destiny</hi> Thanks very civilly; <hi>Destiny</hi> to do

ended his obscure Life, without giving notice of it to
his Friends; insomuch, that when they entred his Room,
after the conclusion of the Peace, they found there was no
more to be done than to Bury him. The Curate pray'd o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the dead Body, and did it very well, for he was short.
His Vicar came to relieve him, and in the mean time, the
Widow bethought her self to roar and cry, which she did
with a great deal of Ostentation and Vanity. The Brother
of the Deceased dissembled being sorrowful, or was so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed;

eat a Bit with em. <hi>Destiny</hi> who had eaten nothing yet a
that Day, and had used a great deal of Exercise, fell to
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:53808:82"/>
with a greedy Appetite; <hi>Leander</hi> fed more upon amorous
Thoughts than upon Victuals; and the Curate talked more
than he did eat. He told them a Hundred pleasant Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
about the Avarice of the Deceased; and acquainted 'em
with the comical Quarrels which this reigning Passion had
often caus'd him to have, both with his Wife and his
Neighbours. Among the rest, he related to them, how he
took once a Journey to <hi>Laval</hi> with his Wife: Now as they
came back, the Horse that carried them both, having lost
two of his Shoes, he left his Wife holding the Horse by the
Bridle, at the Foot of a Tree, and went back as far as
<hi>Laval,</hi> to look for his Horse's Shoes: but he got nothing but
his Labour for his Pains, whilst his Wife lost almost all
Patience with waiting for him; (for they were come two
Leagues from <hi>Laval</hi>) and began to be in great Pain about
him, when she espyed him coming bare-foot, with his Boots
and Hose in his Hands. She was not a little surpriz'd at
this novelty, but she durst not ask him the reason of it, for
by obeying his Officers in the Wars, he had made himself
capable to domineer at home. Neither did she dare to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict
him, when she was commanded to pull of her Stockins;
or so much as ask him why she did it, only she thought 'twas out
of Devotion. He caus'd his Wife to lead his Horse by the
Bridle, whilst he walk'd behind to drive him: Thus the Man
and the Wife, without Shoes or Stockins, and the unshod Horse,
after a tedious and troublesome March, came home at last, late
in the Night, all three very much tired; both the Inn-keeper
and his Wife, with their Feet so gall'd and so sore, that they
could not Walk for almost a Fortnight after. He never was
more pleas'd with any thing he had done before, and when
ever he thought on't, he told his Wife laughing, that if they had
not come bare-Foot from <hi>Laval,</hi> they had been at a great Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
for Shoes, both for themselves and their Horse. <hi>Destiny</hi>
and <hi>Leander</hi> did not much take notice of the Story, tho' the
Curate told it as a good one, either because they did not
find it so pleasant as he said it was, or because they were not
then in Humour to laugh. The Curate who was a great Talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
was not contented with this, but had still a mind to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to another, and told <hi>Destiny</hi> that what they heard was
nothing in comparison of what he had to tell 'em, about the
Inn-keepers preparing himself for Death. 'Tis now four or
five Days, continued he, since he knew he was past recovery;
and yet he never was more sparing: he grudged himself all
the new-laid Eggs he cat during his Illness; had a mind
to know to a Farthing the charge of his Burial, and even would
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:53808:83"/>
have bated something of my Fees, the Day I heard his Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion;
in short, to end as he began, two Hours before he died,
he order'd his Wife, in my Hearing, to bury him in an old Sheet
which he knew was somewhere about the House, and which
had above a Hundred holes in it. His Wife represented to him
how undecent it would be for him to be Buried in it; but
he grew obstinate, and would have no other. His Wife could
not find in her Heart to consent to it, and because she saw him
unable to beat her, she maintain'd her Opinion with more
assurance than she ever did, without breaking in upon the
Duty which an honest Wife owes her Husband, whether he
be cross or no. At last she askt how he could pretend to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
in the Valley of <hi>Iosaphat,</hi> and in what pickle he would
rise from the Dead? The Sick Man fell into a Passion, and
swearing as he used to do when he was in Health, Zounds,
cry'd he, I never intend to rise again. I had as much ado
to forbear laughing, as to make him understand that he had
offended God by thus falling into a Passion, and much more
by what he had said to his Wife, which was a piece of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>

                     </gap>
and Impiety. He made an act of Contrition for it,
tho' something against the Grain, and not without a Promise on
our side, that he should be Buried in no other Sheet but what
he had pitch'd upon. My Brother who burst out a laughing
when he heard him so loudly and plainly renounce his Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
could not forbear laughing at it still, as often as he
thought on it again; this the Brother of the deceas'd took ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
at, and from Words advancing to Blows, my Brother
and he, both equally sturdy and Passionate, had laid hold of one
another, and perhaps would be still cuffing and fighting, if you
had not parted them. Thus the Curate made an end of his
Relation; having all the while addressed himself to <hi>Destiny,</hi>
because <hi>Leander</hi> did not give him much Attention. He took
his leave of the Strollers with repeated offers of Service; and
<hi>Destiny</hi> endeavoured to adminster some drops of Comfort to the
afflicted <hi>Leander,</hi> and bid him hope the best. As bruised as the
poor Youth was, he now and then lookt out at the Window
to see if his Man came, as if his looking would make him
come the sooner. But when People wait with Impatience for
any Body, the wisest Men are foolish enough to look towards
the Place from whence they expect him; which Reflection
shall be the close of my Sixth Chapter.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>LEander,</hi> as I said before, was looking out at the Window
towards the Place from whence his Man was to come,
when turning his Head to the other side, he saw little <hi>Ragotin</hi>
just arriving, booted up to his Waste, mounted on a little
Mule, and accompanied by <hi>Rancour</hi> and <hi>Olive,</hi> holding his Stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup-Leathers, one on one side, and the other on t'other, like
two great Foot-men that walk by the side of a new Sheriffs
Horse on a Lord Mayor's Day. They heard from Town
to Town which way <hi>Destiny</hi> went, and with often enquiring af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
him, found him out at last. <hi>Destiny</hi> went down Stairs to meet
'em, and carried them up into his Chamber. They did not
know at first young <hi>Leander,</hi> his looks being changed with
his Cloaths; yet least they should find out who he was, <hi>Destiny</hi>
ordered him to go down and fee that Supper was got ready,
with the same Authority with which he used to speak to him;
and because the Strollers, who by that began to know him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
wondred at his being so fine, <hi>Destiny</hi> answered for him,
and told them that an Uncle he had in the lower <hi>Mayne,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quip'd
him from Head to Foot just as they saw him, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
had given him Money to make him leave the Stage, which
he refused to do, and so came away from him without taking his
Leave. <hi>Destiny</hi> and the rest asked one another News about
what they all lookt for, but were not the wiser for it. <hi>Ragotin</hi>
assured <hi>Destiny</hi> that he left the Women in good Health, though
much afflicted for Mistriss <hi>Angelica</hi>'s Rape. At last, Night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
come, they went to Supper, the new Comers drunk hard,
and the rest like sober Men. <hi>Ragotin</hi> began to be Merry, chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged
every Body to Drink, like a Tavern-huff as he was;
broke many a silly Jest, and fell a singing in spite of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany:
But no Body caring to be his Second, and the Hostess's
Brother-in-Law having learnedly represented, that it did not look
well for them to make a Debauch so near a dead Corps, <hi>Rago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi>
made less noise, but drunk a great deal more Wine. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
they went to Bed, <hi>Destiny</hi> and <hi>Leander</hi> in the Room
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:53808:84"/>
they had already taken, and <hi>Ragotin, Rancour,</hi> and <hi>Olive</hi> in a
little Room next to the Kitchen, and by the Chamber where
lay the Corps of the Deceased. The Hostess took up her
Quarters in an upper Room, near that of <hi>Destiny</hi> and <hi>Leander,</hi>
both to avoid the gastly sight of a dead Husband, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Consolatory Visits of her Friends, who came to her
in great numbers; for she was one of the topping Women of
the Village, and was as much belov'd by every Body as her
Husband was hated. All things were in a profound Silence
in the Inn; the Dogs were asleep, since they did not bark;
all the other Animals slept also, or ought to do it, and this
Tranquillity lasted till between two and three a Clock in
the Morning, when on a sudden <hi>Ragotin</hi> cry'd out as loud as
he could bawl, that <hi>Rancour</hi> was Dead. Now all at once,
he waked <hi>Olive,</hi> rouz'd <hi>Destiny</hi> and <hi>Leander,</hi> and got them
to come down into the Kitchen in order to Weep, or at
least to see <hi>Rancour,</hi> who, he said, died suddenly by his side.
<hi>Destiny</hi> and <hi>Leander</hi> followed him, and the first thing they
saw as they entred the Room, was <hi>Rancour</hi> walking up and
down like a Man in good Health, which is no such
easy matter after sudden Death. <hi>Ragotin</hi> who went in first
of all, no sooner espy'd him, but he flew back as if he had
been going to tread on a Serpent, or step off a Precipice:
He gave a great shriek; turned pale as Death, and knock'd
so fierely <hi>Destiny</hi> and <hi>Leander,</hi> as he flew out of the Room,
that he was like to throw 'em on the Ground. Whilst his
Fear made him run as far as the Garden that belonged to
the Inn, where he was like to catch Cold, <hi>Destiny</hi> and
<hi>Leander</hi> ask'd <hi>Rancour</hi> the Particulars of his Death. <hi>Rancour</hi>
answer'd he could not give so good an account of it as <hi>Rago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
adding, that he was a little crackt Brain'd. In the mean
time <hi>Olive</hi> was splitting his Sides with laughing, <hi>Rancour</hi> stood
Speechless and unconcern'd, as he used to do upon such Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions,
and neither of them would discover what they knew
of the Matter. <hi>Leander</hi> made after <hi>Ragotin,</hi> and found him
lurking behind a Tree, trembling with Fear more than with
Cold, tho' he was naked in his Shirt. His Fancy was so
full of Dead <hi>Rancour,</hi> that he presently took <hi>Leander</hi> for his
Ghost: and was going to run away as he advanced towards
him: Thereupon arriv'd <hi>Destiny,</hi> whom he took for another
Ghost, both ask'd him several Questions, but could get no ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
from him; at last they took him under the Arms, in
order to carry him back to his Chamber; but as they were
stepping out of the Garden, and <hi>Rancour</hi> advancing to come
into it. <hi>Ragotin</hi> disengag'd himself from those that held him,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:53808:84"/>
and looking behind him with wild staring Eyes, thrust himself
into a Thicket of Rose-Bushes, where he intangled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
from Head to Foot, and was not able to get out time
enough to avoid the encounter of <hi>Rancour,</hi> who called him
a Mad-man a thousand times, and told him he must be shut
up. They all three pulled him out of the Rose-bushes; <hi>Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour</hi>
gave him a sound flap on the Breech, to let him feel he
was not Dead, and at last our frighted little Man was carried
back into his Room, and put to Bed again. But he scarce
was got into it, when a great noise of Female Voices, which
they heard in the next Room, put them at a stand to know
what the Matter was; these were not the Complaints of an
afflicted Woman alone, but the hideous cries of several Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
together, as when they are in a fright. <hi>Destiny</hi> went
into the Room, where he found four or five Women with the
Hostess, who look'd under the Beds, and in the Chimny,
and were terribly frighted. He asked them what the matter
was? and the Hostess half howling, half speaking, told him:
they did not know what was become of her poor Husbands
Corps. She had scarce uttered these Words but she began to
howl, all the other Women, as if it was a howling Consort,
answered her in a Chorus, and all together made so great and so
lamentable a noise, that every Body in the Inn came into
that Room, and all the Neighbours and goers by into the
Inn. In the mean time an arch Pilferer of a Cat, seiz'd upon
a Pigeon, which an unwary Maid had left half larded on the
Kitchen-dresser, and retiring with her Prey into <hi>Ragotin</hi>'s
Chamber, hid her self under the Bed where he lay with <hi>Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour.</hi>
The Maid followed Puss with a Faggot-stick in her
Hand, and looking under the Bed to know what was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
of her Pigeon, she cried out as loud as she could, that
she had fourd her Master, which she repeated so often, that
the Hostess and the rest of the Women came to her. The
Maid fell about her Mistresses Neck, and told her she had
found her Master with such a Transport of Joy, that the
poor Widow was afraid her Husband was come to Life again,
for they took notice that she turned as pale as a Malefactor
that receives Sentence. At last the Maid bad 'em look under
the Bed, where they espy'd the Corps they were so much in
pain about. Altho' it was very heavy, the greatest difficulty
was not to get it from thence, as to know who had put it there;
however they carried it into its Chamber where they began to
dress it for Burial. The Players withdrew up Stairs to <hi>Destiny's</hi>
Room, who all this while did not know what to make of all
those strange Accidents. As for <hi>Leander</hi> his Head ran upon no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:53808:85"/>
but his dear <hi>Angelica,</hi> which made him as sullen and pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive,
as <hi>Ragotin</hi> was sorry that <hi>Rancour</hi> was not Dead; by
whose Raillery he was so mortified, that he had not a Word
to say, contrary to his Custom of speaking continually, and
intruding into all Conversations right or wrong. <hi>Rancour</hi> and
<hi>Olive</hi> were so little surprised, both at <hi>Ragotin</hi>'s <hi>Panick</hi> Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
and the Transmigration of a dead Corps from one Room
to another without any humane assistance, at least that any
Body knew of that <hi>Destiny</hi> began to suspect they had no
small share in the Prodigy. In the mean time they were debat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Case in the Kitchen, in order to know the truth of
the Matter. One of the Plough Servants, who came from the
Field to eat his Dinner, hearing one of the Maids relate in a
great fright, that her Masters Corps was got up of its self and
walked, told her that as he went through the Kitchen at
break of Day, he saw two Men in their Shirts, who carried
it on their Shoulders into the Room where 'twas found. The
Brother of the Deceased heard what the Fellow said, and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
resented so foul an Action; the Widow and her Friends were
presently made acquainted with it; all were very much of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
at it. and with one Voice concluded that those Men
must certainly be Sorcerers, and that they designed to do some
Wicked thing or other with the Corps. Whilst they were
passing this untoward Judgment upon <hi>Rancour,</hi> he came into
the Kitchen, to bid 'em carry up something to Breakfast into
their Chamber. The Brother of the Deceased ask'd him, Why
he carried his Brothers Body into his Room? But <hi>Rancour</hi>
was so far from returning him an Answer, that he did not so
much as exchange a Look with him. The Widow put the
same Qestion to him; he shewed her the same indifference,
which the good Dame did not him; For she flew in his Face
as furious as a Lioness bereft of her Whelps, (I fear the
Simile is a little too Magnificent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>) Her Brother-in-law gave
a sound Cuff to <hi>Rancour;</hi> the Hostess's Friends did not spare
him; the Maids put in for their Share, as did also the Men.
But a single Man could not afford room for the Blows of
so many Strikers, vvho rather hindred one another; <hi>Rancour</hi>
alone against so many, and by consequence so many against
him, vvas not daunted by the number of his Enemies, and
making Virtue of a Necessity, he began to use all the strength
and Activity that God Almighty put into his Hands, leaving
the rest to Fortune. Never vvas an unequal Fight so obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
maintain'd; for <hi>Rancour</hi> preserving his Judgment amidst
the greatest Dangers, made use of his Policy as vvell as
his Strength, dealt his Blovvs vvith Prudence, and improv'd
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:53808:85"/>
'em to the best Advantage. He gave many a Box, vvhich
not falling full upon the first Cheek it met in its way, but
sliding as it were, reach'd a second, and sometimes a third
Cheek, because he generally whirl'd about when he was going
to strike, so that with one single blow he often extracted three
different Sounds, out of three different Chops. At the noise of
the Combatants, <hi>Olive</hi> came down into the Kitchen, and had
sacre time to discern his Comrade amongst all those that bela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured
him, before he felt himself more fiercely attackt even
than <hi>Rancour,</hi> whose Valour and vigorous Resistance began to
strike his Foes with terror; therefore two or three of those
whom <hi>Rancour</hi> abused most, fell foul upon <hi>Olive</hi> only perhaps
to get their Revenge. The noise increased, and at the same
time the Hostels received such a great Cuff on her little Pigs-Eyes
that she saw a Hundred thousand Lights (this is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
number for an uncertain one) and was intirely disabled.
She howl'd and roar'd more fiercely, and perhaps more heartily
than she did about her Husbands Death. Her howling brought
all the Neighbours to her House, and <hi>Destiny</hi> and <hi>Leander</hi> into
the Kitchen; tho' these came with a Spirit of Peace, yet they
presently made War upon 'em, without saying why nor where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
they did not want Cuffs and Boxes, neither were they
so uncivil as to suffer those to want them, who were so
bountiful to them. The Hostess, her Friends, and her
Maids, cry'd out Thieves, and were now bare Spectators
of the Fight, some with Eyes black and blue, others with
bloody Noses, others again with broken Chops, and all
of 'em vvith their Head-Cloths torn in pieces. The Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
espous'd the Quarrel of the Hostess, against those
she called Thieves; and 'tvvould require a better Pen than
mine can pretend to be, to discribe the noble Cuffs that vvere
given and received on both sides. Ar last Animosity and Fury
had so possest their Breasts, that they began to seize on the
Spits, and all Moveables that one may fling at anothers Head,
when the Curate came into the Kitchen, and endeavoured to
make the Battle cease. To speak the Truth, altho' they all
had a great Respect for his Character, he had much ado to
part the Combatants, if their weariness had not inclin'd them to his
Advice. Thus all acts of Hostility ceased on both sides, but the
noise continued as before; for every one pretended to be heard
first, the Women especially before the Men with their false treble
Voices, the poor good Man was fain to stop his Ears and run to
the Door. This silenc'd the most obstreperous: Whereupon he fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
about, enter'd the Field of Battel, and commanded the Inn-keepr's
Brother to speak: He first of all complain'd of the
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:53808:86"/>
dead Corps being carried from one Room to another, and had
exaggerated the Enormity of the Fact, had he had less Blood
to spit out of his Mouth, besides the bleeding at his Nose,
which he could not stop. <hi>Rancour</hi> and <hi>Olive</hi> pleaded Guilty
to the Indictment, protesting withal, that they had not done
it with any ill Intent, but only to fright one of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rades,
as they really did. The Curate blamed'em very
much for it, and shew'd 'em the ill Consequence of such an
Action, which was carrying a Jest too far. However being
a Man of Parts, and of great Interest among his Parishioners,
he found no difficulty in adjusting the Quarrel, and so all
parted upon even Terms. But wild Discord with her hissing
Snakes instead of Hair, had not yet compleated all the Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
she design'd to do in that House, for now there was
heard in the upper Room. such Roaring, as little differs from
that of a Hog when he is going to be killed, and yet he
that roared at this rate, was no other than <hi>Ragotin,</hi> The
Curate, the Strollers, and several others ran to him, and found
him sunk up to the Neck into a great Wooden-chest, where
the Hostess kept her Linnen; and what was yet more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
to the poor entrapp'd <hi>Ragotin,</hi> the Lid of the Trunk
which was thick and heavy, was fallen upon his Legs, and
squeez'd 'em so, that it griev'd ones Heart to see it. A lusty
Chamber-Maid, who stood near the Trunk when they entred
the Room, and look'd very much concern'd, was suspected
of having put <hi>Ragotin</hi> in so ill a Place. This was the Truth
of the business; and she was so proud of what she had done,
that whilst she was making one of the Beds, she did not vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe
to mind how they could get <hi>Ragotin</hi> out of the Trunk,
nor so much as answer those who ask'd her the occasion of
the Noise they heard. In the mean time the little Man was
got out of his Trap, and had no sooner the use of his Feet
but he ran to his Sword. They hindred him from laying hold
of it, but could not keep him from closing with the tall
Maid, whom he could not hinder from giving him such a
fierce Blow on the Pate, that all the vast Seat of his nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
Reason was shaken with it. This made him start three
Steps backward, but it had been but a Spring towards a Leap,
had not <hi>Olive</hi> held him by the Breeches, as he was going
to shoot like a Serpent against his dreadful Adversary. The
Effort he made, (tho' to no purpose) was so violent, that the
Waste-band of his Breeches was broken, as was likewise the
Silence of the Company, who all fell a Laughing. The Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
forgot his Gravity, and the Inn-keepers Brother his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction.
<hi>Ragotin</hi> alone was not dispos'd to Laugh, and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:53808:86"/>
his Anger against <hi>Olive,</hi> who being offended at it, truss'd
him up, and carried him, (Brandishing his Legs) on the
Bed which the Maid was making, where with the Strength
of a <hi>Hercules,</hi> he pull'd down his Breeches, (whose Waste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
was already broken) and then lifting up his Hands,
and letting them fall quick and amain on his Thighs, and
Places adjacent, in the twinkling of an Eye, made them look
as red as Scarlet. Bold <hi>Ragotin</hi> flung himself with great
Courage from the Bed on the Ground, but this venturous
Action was not attended with the success it deserv'd. His
Foot got into a Chamber-pot, which to his great Misfortune
was left <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>n the Bed-side, and went in so deep, that not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
able to get it out by the help of the other Foot, he
durst not step from the Bed-side where he was, for fear of
making yet more Sport for the Company, and bringing their
Raillery upon him, which he bore more impatiently than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Man. Every body wonder'd to see him so quiet, after, so
great an Emotion. <hi>Rancour</hi> suspected there was something
more than ordinary; and having caus'd him to come out from
the Bed-side, half willing, half not, all the Company per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd

                  <head type="sub">What became of Ragotin's Foot.</head>
                  <p>HAD <hi>Ragotin</hi> by his own Strength, and without the help
of his Friends, been able to <hi>unpot</hi> his Foot, I mean, to
get out of that scurvy Pot, it had so unluckily got into,
his Anger would have lasted, at least all the remainder of the
Day: But he was fain to abate somewhat of his natural
Pride, and be submissive; humbly beseeching <hi>Destiny</hi> and <hi>Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rcur</hi>
to procure the Liberty of his Foot, right or left, for it
never came to my Knowledge which of the two it was. He
did not address himself to <hi>Olive,</hi> because of what past be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
'em: But nevertheless, <hi>Olive</hi> came to his Aid, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
entreaty, and both his Comrades and he, us'd their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:53808:87"/>
to relieve him. The repeated Efforts the little Man
made to get his Foot out of the Pot, had caus'd it to swell,
and those which <hi>Destiny</hi> and <hi>Olive</hi> us'd swell'd it yet a
great deal more. <hi>Rancour</hi> put his Hand to it first of all,
but so aukwardly, or rather maliciously, that <hi>Ragotin</hi> thought
he had a mind to make him Lame for ever. He desir'd him
very earnestly to let it alone, as also his Comrades, and laid
himself down upon a Bed, till the Smith they had sent for, came
to File the Pot off his Foot. The remaining part of the Day
past pretty quietly in the Inn, tho' somewhat melancholily le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<hi>Destiny</hi> and <hi>Leander,</hi> the one being very much in Pain
about his Man, who did not come to bring him News of
his Mistriss, according to Promise; and the other not find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it in his Heart to be merry without his dear Mistriss <hi>Star;</hi>
and besides, he was concern'd at the Rape of <hi>Angelica,</hi> and
pityed poor <hi>Leander,</hi> in whose Face he saw all the Marks
of deep Affliction. <hi>Rancour</hi> and <hi>Olive</hi> soon made a Match
with some of the Inhabitants of the Village, who were at
Bowls; and <hi>Ragotin,</hi> the Operation on his Foot being over,
compos'd himself to rest, whether he was really sleepy, or
because he was asham'd to appear in publick, after his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky
Adventures, The Corps of the Inn-keeper was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
to his long home, and mine Hostess, notwithstanding the
pious Thoughts which her Husband's Death ought to have
suggested to her, exacted upon two <hi>English</hi> Men, who went
from <hi>Brittany</hi> to <hi>Paris,</hi> with as much Barbarity, as if she
had been a <hi>Dutch-Inn-keeper.</hi> The Sun was just now set,
when <hi>Destiny</hi> and <hi>Leander,</hi> who could not stir from their Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
espyed a Coach with four Horses, attended by three
Men on Horseback, and four Foot-men. Soon after, a Maid
came to desire 'em to resign their Chamber to the new Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
and so <hi>Ragotin</hi> was oblig'd to shew himself, altho'
he had a mind to keep his Chamber, and follow'd <hi>Destiny</hi>
and <hi>Leander</hi> into that, where the Day before he fancied he
had seen <hi>Rancour</hi> die. <hi>Destiny</hi> was known in the Kitchen
by one of the Gentlemen of the Coach, who was the same
Counsellor of the <hi>Parliament</hi> of <hi>Rennes,</hi> with whom he got
acquainted at the Wedding, so fatal to poor <hi>Cave.</hi> This
<hi>Briton</hi> Senator, enquir'd of <hi>Destiny</hi> about <hi>Angelica,</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest
a concern that she was not found. His Name was <hi>la
Garouffiere,</hi> which makes me believe he was rather <hi>Angevin</hi>
than <hi>Briton,</hi> for we see as few <hi>Briton</hi> Names begin with
<hi>Gar,</hi> as we see many <hi>Angevin</hi> ones ending in <hi>lere; Norman,</hi>

not required at <hi>Rennes,</hi> he generally came to <hi>Paris</hi> to spend
a Sum of Money in the Publick Houses, and put on black
Clothes when the Court went into Mourning. Which being
duely verified and recorded, ought to be as good as a Patent
if not of Nobility, at least of Gentility; besides, he was a Wit
by the same Reason that most People pretend to have their
share in ingenious Diversions, as well those that have skill in
'em, as the Proud, brutish and Ignorant Coxcombs, who pass
their rash Censure upon Verse and Prose, tho' at the same time
they think it a dishonour to write well, and would upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
reproach a Man for making Books, as for Counterfeiting
the King's Coin. However, Strollers are the better for these
Pretenders, and are the more caressed in all the Towns in
which they Act: For being the Parrots of the Poets, and some
among 'em who have Wit, writing sometimes Plays, either
out of their own stock, or what they borrow from several o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
People are in a manner ambitious of knowing them
or being in their Company. In our Days the World has done
justice to their Profession, and has a greater esteem for 'em than
formerly: And to speak the Truth, Plays in themselves are a
most innocent Diversion, and may be as Instructive as en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaming.
They are now a-days, at least at <hi>Paris,</hi> purged
from their former Licentiousness; and 'twere to be wished
that the Play-Houses were as well cleared from Pick-Pockers,
Pages, Foot-men, Whores, Orange-Wenches, and such other
Vermine, who haunt those Places rather to Steal a Purse, or pick
up a Cull, than to hear the silly Jests of Farces: But now
Farces are in a manner exploded, and I am sure there are many

to laugh again, except <hi>Bouvillon,</hi> who colour'd at it, and
cast an angry Look upon her poor Daughter-in-law, which
pall'd a little their Joy. At last they made an end of laughing,
because 'tis not possible to laugh for ever; Madam <hi>Bouvil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi>

their Eyes and Cheeks, and the young Bride askt their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,

his Plate on the middle of the Table, and every one took
his own share out of it. They talk'd of nothing else during
all the Supper, and Raillery good or bad was carried on to
a high pitch, tho' the serious Air, which Madam <hi>Bouvillon</hi>
put on preposterously, did in some measure disturb the Mirth
of the Company. Assoon as Supper was over, and the Cloth
taken away, the Ladies retired to their Chamber, the Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>care

that know not what to do when they do not Play, had to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
a very ingenious Conversation, and perhaps the best
that ever was held in an Inn of lower <hi>Mayne. La Garouffiere</hi>
spoke with Desing, of all he thought most remote from the

narrower Limits than his Memory; but <hi>Destiny</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed
of every thing like a Man of great skill, and who
understands the World. Among the rest, with all the nicety
of Discerment imaginable, he distinguish'd those Women
who have a great deal of Wit, and never use it but when
there's occasion for it, from those who use it only to be
thought Witty. Likewise those Women who endeavour to
imitate silly Buffoons, that can laugh at, and even use them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
licentious Allusions and paltry Equivocations, in a

of those Women who write as well as those Men, that make
it their Profession, and who do not publish the Productions of
their Brain, only out of a principle of Modesty. <hi>La Garou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ffiere</hi>
who was an accomplisht Gentleman, and knew how to

he never was better in all his Life. 'Twas not long
before they fell a sleep; and <hi>Ragotin</hi> may thank the respect which
<hi>Rancour</hi> paid to the honourable Company that came to the
Inn, whose Repose he would not disturb; otherwise the little
Man had had but a sorry Night. In the mean time <hi>Olive</hi>
was busie about his Clothes, and having put them in good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair,
he took <hi>Ragotin</hi>'s Cloaths, and with the Dexterity of a nice
Taylor, made both the Doublet and Breeches straiter, and
laid them again in their Places; and now having past the
greatest part of the Night in sowing and unsowing, he went
into Bed with <hi>Ragotin</hi> and <hi>Rancour.</hi> They got up betimes,
as 'tis usual in all Inns, where the noise begins with the Day,
<hi>Rancour</hi> told <hi>Ragotin</hi> he lookt very ill; <hi>Olive</hi> told him the same,
he began to believe 'em, and finding at the same time his Clothes
above four Inches too strait, he did not Question but that he
was swo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n by so much, during that little time he was a sleep, and
was not a little frighted at this sudden swelling. <hi>Rancour</hi> and
<hi>Olive</hi> still continued to tell him how ill he lookt, and <hi>Destiny</hi>
and <hi>Leander,</hi> whom they acquainted with the Plot, told him
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:53808:89"/>
he was strangely alter'd. Poor <hi>Ragotin</hi> was very much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd,
and wept at it: <hi>Destiny</hi> could not forbear smiling,
which made the little Man very angry. He went into the
Kitchen, where every Body told him of his ill Looks; the like
did the Company that belong'd to the Coach, who having a
great way to go, got up betimes. They invited the Strollers
to Breaskfast with 'em, and all drunk Sick <hi>Ragotin's</hi> Health, who
instead of thanking them for't, went out grumbling at 'em, and
in a heavy taking repair'd to the Surgeon of the Town, to whom
he gave an account of his swelling. The Surgeon made a
long Deseant upon the Cause and Effect of his Disease, which
he understood no better than <hi>Algebra,</hi> and for above a quarter
of an Hour entertain'd him with the obscure Terms of his Art,
little to the Purpose, as if he had discoursed about <hi>Prester-Iohn.
Ragotin</hi> grew impatient, and ask'd him, Swearing to
admiration for a little Man, whether he had nothing else to
say to him. The Surgeon would have gone on in his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonings,
but <hi>Ragotin</hi> threatned to beat him, and had cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
done it, had not the Surgeon humbled himself before
his angry Patient, from whom he drew twelve Ounces of
Blood, and Cup'd him on the Shoulders at a venture. The
Operation was just done when <hi>Leander</hi> came to tell <hi>Ragotin</hi>
that if he would promise not to be angry, he would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
him with a piece of <hi>Roguery</hi> they had done him. He
promis'd more than <hi>Leander</hi> desir'd, and swore as he hop'd to
be sav'd to be as good as his Promise. <hi>Leander</hi> told him he
desired to have Witness to his Oath, and carried him back to
the Inn, where in the presence of all, both Masters and Servants,
he made him swear a new, and then told him somebody had
made his Cloaths straiter. At first <hi>Ragotin</hi> redden'd for shame,
and then turning pale with Anger and Indignation, he was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to break his dreadful and solemn Oath, when seven or
eight Persons at once began to preach to him with such ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemence,
that tho he swore like Mad, yet he could not be
heard. He ceased to bluster; but the rest did not give over
to round him in the Ears, which they continued doing so
long, that the Poor Man was like to lose his Hearing for it.
At last he came off better than was expected, for he fell a
Singing, as loud as ever he could, what Songs came first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his Mouth, which changed the great noise of confu'd Voices
into repeated peals of Laughing, which from the Masters were
eccho'd by the Servants, and passed from the Place of Action,
to all the Places in the Inn, where different businesses called
different Persons. Whilst the noise of so many People laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
together diminishes by degrees, and is lost in the Air,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:53808:90"/>
somewhat like the sound of distant Ecchoes, the faithful
Chronologer shall make an end of this present Chapter, under
the gracious favour of the Reader, whether Courteous or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courteous,

Dinner was getting ready she spent her time in Dressing. First
she Curl'd and Powder'd, then put on a lac'd Apron and
Nightraile, and afterwards took to pieces a <hi>Point de Venise</hi>
Cravat of her Sons to make her a <hi>Commode.</hi> After this she
opened her Daughter-in-Laws Trunk, and took thence her
Wedding Gown and put it on: In a Word, being thus trickt
up and adorn'd, she seem'd like to any little <hi>Venus</hi> in a Cloud,
tho' that somewhat of the fattest. Now, notwithstanding all
these preparations of hers, <hi>Destiny</hi> had no doubt much rather
have Dined with his Companions; but then how could he
have obey'd the Commands of his very humble Servant Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
<hi>Bouvillon?</hi> He therefore not knowing how to get free,
was forced to comply; but was not a little surpriz'd when he
saw his Paramour so youthfully drest. She received him with
a smiling Countenance, took him by the Hands to have him
wash them, and squeez'd him after a manner that meant some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more than ordinary. He for his part was less Sollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
of his Invitation than of the occasion of it, and therefore
often neglected Eating, which gave her opportunity to press it.
He knew not what to say to her, being naturally no great
Speaker; but she plentifully supply'd that defect by her never
ceasing Clack. She was but too ingenious to suffer any chalm
in Conversation for want of something to say. When a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
that talks much, meers with a Man that says little and
does not answer her, she always talks the more, for judging of
her Friend by her self, and perceiving that he has not <hi>Repar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teed</hi>
to what she advanced, she presently believes he has not
been pleased with what was said; and therefore to mend
the Matter, proceeds to say a great deal more, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
proves as Impertinent as her first Discourse was Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous.
The only way that I can propose to deal with such
Women as these, is to talk as much, if not more than they,
for thereby if they cannot be silenc'd, their Voices may at
least be drowned. As for the matchless <hi>Bouvillon,</hi> she was the
most immoderate Talker of nothing, that ever was known,
and she not only talk'd to her self while she was in private,
but would answer her self likewise. The silent disposition of
<hi>Destiny</hi> giving her an Opportunity, she determin'd to divert
him with some large Relation or other. The Subjects she
chose to speak of, was the Intrigues of <hi>Laval,</hi> the Town where
she lived; but she never hapned to blame any Person or Action
but she always took thence an occasion to commend her self,
protesting at every fling of Satyr on her Neighbour, that
tho' she was guilty of many Faults, yet in that Particular
he was Innocent. Tho' <hi>Destiny</hi> was extremely mortify'd at
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:53808:91"/>
the beginning of her Discourse, and made no Answer, yet he
afterwards found himself oblig'd for quietness sake, to smile
now and then, and sometimes to cry out, <hi>Oh! That's Pleasant<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </hi>
or <hi>That's strange!</hi> both which he often spoke <hi>Mal à propos.</hi>
Assoon as <hi>Destiny</hi> had done eating, the Voider was brought,
and the Table cleared. Then Madam <hi>Bouvillon</hi> clapping her
self down at the Feet of the Bed, pulled him down by her,
and her Servant, (letting the Waiters of the Inn go out first)
leaving her likewise, drew the Door after her, and shut it:
This Madam <hi>Bouvillon</hi> perceiving, and thinking that <hi>Destiny</hi> had
also observ'd it, said to him, <hi>See this Foolish Iade has shut the
Door after her.</hi> To which he reply'd. <hi>If you please, Madam,
I'll go and open</hi> 
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> No, said she, stopping him, <hi>let it alone;
but you know,</hi> continu'd she, <hi>when two Persons are lock'd up to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
as they have an opportunity to do what they please, Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
will judge of them as they think fit. 'Tis not on such Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations
as yours, Madam,</hi> reply'd <hi>Destiny for People to pass
rash Iudgments. However, Sir,</hi> quoth <hi>Bouvillon, one cannot
have too much caution against Slander. Well, Madam,</hi> reply'd
<hi>Destiny, but People will not Talk without Grounds, and sure they
can have none when they reflect upon the Inequality of our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions.
Will you please therefore, Madam,</hi> continued he, <hi>that
I go open the Door. By no means, Sir,</hi> quoth she, going to
bolt it, and adding withal. <hi>For as long as People think it
shut, it is better it were really so, that no Body may come in
upon us without our consent.</hi> Having said this, and perform'd
the Office of a Friend for her self, she turn'd towards <hi>Destiny,</hi>
giving him to understand by her large fiery Cheeks, and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
sparkling Eyes, what Sport she had a mind to be at;
then she proceeded to take off her Hankerchief from her Neck,
and thereby discover'd to her Lover at least ten Pound of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uberant
Flesh, that is to say near the third part of her Bosom,
the rest being distributed in two equal Portions under her
Arm-pitts: This ill Intention of hers causing her to Blush,
(which sometimes the most Impudent will do) her Neck was
grown as red as her Face, and both together might be well
taken at any distance for a Scarlet<note n="*" place="bottom">Caps which Country Men use, that Button about their Necke.</note> Riding Cap. All this
made <hi>Destiny</hi> to blush too, but it was with Shame, when
I'll give you leave to guess what might be the cause of
Madam <hi>Bouvillons</hi> Then she began to complain <hi>that she
had something that troubled her in her Back,</hi> and moving her
self about in her Harness, as if she had Irch'd, she begged of
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:53808:91"/>
                     <hi>Destiny</hi> to thrust his Hand down her Back to scratch her. This
the Youth immediately obey'd her in, trembling all the while,
but whilst he was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> in pleasing her behind, she di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
her self with him before, handling his sides through
his Wast-coat, and asking him often, <hi>If he was not ticklish
too?</hi> Whilst these Lovers were thus pleasing each other, <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotin</hi>
came to the Door, and knocked and bawled like to any
Madman, calling out aloud to <hi>Destiny</hi> to open to him.
This <hi>Destiny</hi> going immediately to perform, drew his Hand
all sweaty out from <hi>Bouvillons</hi> Back, and oftering to go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
her and the Table, as the shortest cut, chanced to
trip against a Nail in the Floor, which brought him down
with his Head against a Bench in that violent manner, that
he lay sometime for Dead. Madam <hi>Bouvillon</hi> in the mean
time catcht up her Handkercheif, and having thrown it over
her Shoulders, made all the haste she could to open the
Door, which having done, and <hi>Ragotin</hi> pushing against it with
all his force at the same time, gave the poor Lady so cruel a
blow on the Face, that it almost flatted her Nose, and also
raised a bump on her Fore-head, of the bigness of ones Fist.
This made her to cry out, <hi>she was dead,</hi> but which, tho'
the little Rascal heard, he nevertheless made no excuse for, but
leaping and bounding about the Room like Mad, bauled out
<hi>Mrs.</hi> Angelica<hi>'s found! Mrs.</hi> Angelica<hi>'s found!</hi> This he did the
louder to provoke <hi>Destiny</hi>'s Anger, who was all this while cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
for Madam <hi>Bouvillons</hi> Maid to come and help her Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>striss,
which she nevertheless could not possibly hear, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the Noise which <hi>Ragotin</hi> made. At length the Servant
came, and brought Water and a clean Napkin, when between
her and <hi>Destiny</hi> there was quickly some small reparation made
for the damage done by the Door. But however, great was
<hi>Destiny's</hi> Impatience to know what more Nevvs <hi>Ragotin</hi>
brought; he notvvithstanding vvould not leave Madam <hi>Bouvil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi>
till her Face vvas vvash'd and anointed, and her Forehead
bound up vvith a bandage. At last he offer'd to be gone,
but that calling <hi>Ragotin</hi> a Thousand Rogues for the Mischief
he had done on the one side, vvhile <hi>Ragotin</hi> drevv him after
him on the other, to give him a farther account of his
Message.</p>

                  <p>'TIS true Madam <hi>Angelica</hi> was found again, and brought
away by <hi>Leander's</hi> Servant. This Servant had but too
much Wit to let any Body know that <hi>Leander</hi> was his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
and Madam <hi>Angelica</hi> endeavour'd to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> disguise that by
Policy which <hi>Olive</hi> and <hi>Rancour</hi> had done before bluntly.
<hi>Leander</hi> enquired of Madam <hi>Angelica</hi> and his Servant, whom
he made to pass for one of his Friends, <hi>Where and How he
had found her,</hi> and which Questions he happen'd to ask just
as <hi>Ragotin</hi> entred leading in <hi>Destiny</hi> in Triumph, or rather
dragging him after him, because he could not go so fast as
he would have him. At first sight <hi>Destiny</hi> and <hi>Angelica</hi> em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brac'd
with reciprocal Testimonies of Love and Friendship, and
with that tenderness which Lovers long absent are wont to do
on an unexpected Interview <hi>Leander</hi> and she Carress'd only with
their Eyes, leaving farther remonstrances of Kindness to a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Meeting. In the mean time <hi>Leander's</hi> Servant began his
Story, after the following manner, treating his Master all the
while like his Friend. <hi>After I had left you,</hi> quoth he, Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressing
himself to <hi>Leander, I pursued the Ravishers of</hi> Angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,
<hi>according as you had desired me, till Sun-set, when, and not
before, I lost sight of them. Next Morning I was not a little
surpriz'd to find the Lady I look'd after at the entrance of a
Wood alone, on foot, and all dissolv'd in Tears. Hereupon having
acquainted her that I was your Friend, and that it was at your
Request that I had gone in quest of her. She seem'd to be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
comforted, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>beg'd of me to conduct her to</hi> Mans, <hi>or at
least to carry her to</hi> Leander, <hi>if I knew where to find him.
Now, Madam,</hi> continued he, turning to <hi>Angelica, It must be
your part to relate the rest, for you know you were so afflicted on
the Road, that I did not care to ask you any Questions.</hi> Those
that were least curious of all the Company, had yet a mind to
learn from Madam <hi>Angelica's</hi> own Mouth the account of so
strange an Adventure; for strange it might well seem to them,
that a young Lady should be carried away with such Violence,
and be afterwards surrender'd, or rather abandon'd without
the least force. In order to this Relation Madam <hi>Angelica</hi> first
desired they would help her to a Bed; but which they not
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:53808:92"/>
being able to do, by reason that the Inn was full, the honest
Curate oblig'd her with a Chamber in his Sisters House, which
was next Door. Now <hi>Angelica</hi> had not so great occasion for
a Bed to sleep on as to rest her self upon; therefore <hi>Destiny</hi>
and <hi>Leander,</hi> with the rest of the Company, were admitted
to her Bed-side assoon as she was laid. Altho' she would have
been glad that <hi>Destiny</hi> should have had an Opinion of her
Constancy, yet could not she well look upon him without
Blushing. The observing of this made him pity her Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
extremely, and in order to divert her from doing her self
any diskindness, he immediately put her upon relating that
part of the Adventure which <hi>Leander's</hi> Servant could not. This
request of his, she forthwith proceeded to gratify, as follows.
<hi>You may imagine,</hi> quoth she, <hi>my Mother and I were not a
little surpriz'd when while we were walking together in the Park
that adjoins to our House, we saw all of a sudden a little Door
open which looks towards the Country, and five or six Men en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
thereat, who immediately soiz'd upon me, without regarding
my Mother, and carried me away half dead with fear to their
Horses. My Mother, whom ye all know to be one of the most
resolute Women in the World, fell furiously upon the first of those
she overtook, and reduced him to that Condition, that he could
not possibly get out of her Hands till he had called one of his
Companions to his assistance. The Person that rescued him, who
was so base as to beat my Mother, as I heard him afterwards
brag on the Road, was it seems the Author of this enterprize.
He nevertheless came not near me all that Night, during which
we marched like to Persons pursued by an Enemy, and that
through the most by-Roads; for otherwise the noise I made might
have been sufficient to have allarum'd some body to my Relies.
They so manag'd the Matter, that we met with but one little
Village in our way; the Inhabitants thereof I soon raised with
my shrill Notes, but who nevertheless were not numerous enough
to rescue me. The Morning came, and then my Ravisher ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach'd
me; but had no sooner seen me than he flew from me
in great Passion, and afterwards assembled a Council of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions,
which lasted about half an Hour. My Ravisher after
that seem'd to be enrag'd as much as I was grieved, and often
swere to make the Devil to do among his Companions. Their
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>umultous Assembly being at an end, I could by no means come
to know what Resolves they had agreed on. We were put on
our March again; and from that time forward, I had less re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
paid me than before. They quarrel'd with me as often as
they saw me uneasie, and Curs'd me, as if I had been some great
Offender. They carried me away as you might perceive, speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:53808:93"/>
to Leander, with a Players Habit on, but which they hid
by throwing one of their Cloaks over me. They met a Man upon
the Road, of whom they endeavour'd to inform themselves of some
Matters. I was surpriz'd to see it was</hi> Leander, <hi>and I believe
he was no less astonish'd to see me; for he knew me assoon as
ever I discovered my Habit, as well as by my Face. He may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
you if he pleases what he did. For my part, seeing so
many Swords drawn upon him, I fainted away in the Arms of
him that held me upon the Horse, and when I came to my self,
I found we were again upon our March but saw</hi> Leander <hi>no
more till now. Hereupon I began to redouble my Cries; but my
Ravishers, whereof there was one Wounded, little regarding me,
took their way cross the Country, and Yesterday Night stop'd at a
little Village, where they lay and passed for Soldiers. This Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at the entrance of a Wood they met a Man with a young
Gentlewoman on Horseback; her they immediately unmask'd, and
having so done, it seems knew her, when taking her from her
Guardian, and bestowing on him a few blows of a Cudgel,
they rid away with her, as they had done with me; she making
as great, if not greater Lamentations than I had done. When
I heard her Voice. I fancied I knew her, but could not be positive.
After we had got about Fifty Paces into the Wood,. the Man
that seem'd to have the Command of the rest, rid up to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
that carried me, and cried to him,</hi> set down that slabbering
Milksop you have behind you, and let her shift for her self.
<hi>Herein he was immediately obey'd, and I was all of a sudden left
alone upon the Ground. The dread I had to be thus alone
would have certainly been the Death of me, had not this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
here, meaning Leanders</hi> Servant, <hi>who brought me hither
followed me at a distance, and found me in that Condition.
The rest he has acquainted you with. But,</hi> continued she, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressing
her self to <hi>Destiny, I believe that same Lady which
was preferr'd to me might be your Sister, my Companion; and
the reason I have for it, is not only the resemblance of her Voice
with that I heard, but likewise the Man that carried her I dare be
positive was the Servant you took last. What's that you tell me?</hi>
quoth <hi>Destiny</hi> somewhat disturb'd, <hi>I tell you my Thoughts,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
<hi>Angelica, but I may be deceived, one Person may be like
another; yet still I fear it was she. I fear so too,</hi> reply'd <hi>Destiny,</hi>
with his Countenance all chang'd, <hi>for I have some reas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> to
apprehend a certain Person in this Province for an Enemy, that
would do me such a good turn. But how came she at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
of a Wood,</hi> continued he, <hi>when</hi> Ragotin <hi>left her yester<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
at</hi> Mans? <hi>I'll go send away one of my Friends thither pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently,</hi>
pursu'd he, <hi>to know the Truth, while I stay behind to
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:53808:93"/>
determine a Resolution suitable to the News he brings.</hi> As he had
just done speaking he heard some body call him out of the
Street, and stepping to the Window, perceived it was Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>de la Garouffiere,</hi> who was just then return'd from his Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit
and who told him he had something of Importance to
communicate to him. He went down to wait on him, and
thereby left <hi>Leander</hi> and <hi>Angelica</hi> together, to enjoy each other
after so tedious an Absence, and to pour out their Sighs and
Vows into one anothers Bosoms. I fancy 'twould have been
no small Pleasure, either to have seen or heard them; but
still their greatest Happiness was to have been alone. Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this, <hi>Destiny</hi> demanded of <hi>la Garouffiere</hi> what he had to
say to him. <hi>Do you know a certain Gentleman called</hi> Verville,
quoth <hi>Garouffiere, and is he one of your Friends? He is the
only Person that I have been most oblig'd to in the World, reply'd
Destiny, and whom I honour most, and who I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>elieve has the like
kindness and respect for me. I believe it,</hi> answered <hi>Garouffiere, for
I met him to Day at the Gentlemans, where I dined, and all his
Discourse was of you. He asked me a Hundred Questions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
you, without my being able to satisfie him in any, and
if I had not promised to send you to him, he would certainly
have come hither to wait on you before now, altho' he has a great
deal of business upon his Hands where he is. Destiny</hi> thanked
him heartily for his kind Information, and having learnt
farther from him, where his Friend <hi>Verville</hi> was to be found
resolv'd to go to him that Minute, hoping to learn from him
some News of his Enemy <hi>Saldagne,</hi> whom he knew very
well to be the Author of the carrying away of <hi>Angelica,</hi>
and provided she were not mistaken, in the Voice she heard.
of the ravishing of his dear <hi>Star</hi> likewise. He desired his
Companions therefore to return immediately to <hi>Mans,</hi> and to
Congratulate Mrs. <hi>Cave</hi> in his Name, for the News of
the finding of her Daughter, and moreover desired of them
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>ther to send a Man on purpose, or else some one of them
to come back speedily, and bring him Word how his dear

was the way to the Town where <hi>Verville</hi> was to be found.
After which having made the Curate to promise that his Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
should take care of <hi>Angelica,</hi> till such time as he sent
for her from <hi>Mans,</hi> He took <hi>Leanders</hi> Horse, and got about

for some time embracing him, being scarce able to shew the

                     <hi>VErville</hi> and <hi>Destiny</hi> gave an account to each other of all
matters concerning them, which they were seperately
ignorant of. <hi>Verville</hi> tells <hi>Destiny</hi> of the wondrous Brutality
of his Brother <hi>St. Far,</hi> and of the great Patience of his Wife
in bearing with him. Thence he takes an occasion to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol
his own Happiness in having so good a Woman to his,
and afterwards tells him News of the Baron <hi>D'Arques</hi> his
Father, and of Monsieur <hi>de St. Sauveur. Destiny</hi> on his part
relates all his Adventures, not concealing the least, and <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville</hi>
farther acquaints him, that <hi>Saldagne</hi> still continued to
live thereabouts as ill a Life as ever, and promised him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
that if Madam <hi>Star</hi> were to be found in his Custody, he
would do all that lay in his Power to recover her out of
his Hands, at the hazard both of his own Life and those
of his Friends which he could Command. He farther tells
him, that he had no place to retire to but his Father's, and
another Gentleman's in the Country, who was as bad as he,
and besides, who had little or no Estate to maintain himself,
and therefore could not be able to entertain another <hi>long.
He must therefore,</hi> continued he, <hi>come to our House speedily, if
he will remain in our Province. My Father bears with him 'tis
true, on account of some Relation; but my Brother</hi> St. Far <hi>cates
no more for him, whatever Friendship has been formerly between

                     </gap> Friend <hi>Verville's</hi> Destiny liked very well, and resolved to
follow it; but <hi>Verville</hi> being to go to Supper that Night with
the Lord of the Town, an old Man his Relation, who had
design'd him for his Heir, it could not be put in execution
till the next Morning. <hi>Destiny</hi> for his part Supp'd only on
what he could find in the Inn, and went to Bed betimes that
he might not make his Friend wait for him the next Day,
for that they had design'd to be on their Journy by Sun rising.
At the Hour appointed they set forth, and as they rid along
for three Leagues together, entertained each other with those
Particulars that they had not time to speak of before. Assoon
as they were got to their Journeys end, <hi>Verville</hi> plac'd <hi>Desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi>
in the House of a Servant of his, whom he had married
not long before to a Woman in that Town, and who lived
very prettily, not far off from the Baron <hi>D'Arques</hi> his Father.
He gave particular orders that he should be kept private,
and promised that he would return to him in a very short time.
It was not above two Hours before he did return according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
but acquainted <hi>Destiny</hi> at first dash, that he had bad News
to tell him. Hereupon <hi>Destiny</hi> began to grow pale and to trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
but <hi>Verville</hi> soon removed the cause thereof, by the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Relation. <hi>I was no sooner alighted.</hi> quoth he to <hi>Destiny.
but I saw your Friend</hi> Saldagne <hi>carried between four Men into
a Ground Chamber, and that by reason of a fall he had got from
his Horse, which had so bruiz'd him, that he was not able to
walk. At the first sight of me he told me he had occasion to
speak with me, and desired me to come to his Chamber after
that the Surgeon, that was then present, had done dressing of his
Leg, which was extremely shatter'd by his fall. I came accordingly,
and assoon as we were alone, he began thus. I must,</hi> says he,
<hi>confess all my Faults to you, tho' you are the least indulgent
of any of my Censurers, your Prudence being a continual terror
to my Folly. He afterwards owned to me, that he had carried
away a Woman Player, for whom he had had a kindness all his
Life long, and would tell me the Particulars thereof, which he
believed I would be surpriz'd at. He told me consequently that
the Gentleman I was speaking of before, who had been us'd to
entertain him, having been obliged to leave the Province on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of siding with a Brother of his, who had been found to
have made bad Salt, he was forc'd to bring his Booty to my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
House, and that he had desired of his Sister, my Wife, that
she would conceal her in her Appartment, for fear this action of
this should come to my Fathers knowledge, which he said, he
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>dreaded. He afterwards conjured me to lend him one of my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:53808:95"/>
because his own were great Blockheads, that might conduct
her safe to an House of his in</hi> Brittany, <hi>whither he said he would
follow assoon as ever he could well mount a Horse. He ask'd me
farther, if I could not procure him a Man or two more to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
my Servant, for well he knew how difficult a thing it would
be for three Men to carry off a Woman so far without her
consent. I made him believe it was an easy matter, the better
to serve you. Now,</hi> continued <hi>Verville to Destiny, his Servants
are altogether Strangers to you, and mine is a very cunning Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
and Faithful to me, therefore I will cause him to tell</hi> Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dagne
<hi>that he will take along with him a stout Fellow an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
of his to his Assistance; and this same Fellow I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
shall be you. Therefore,</hi> pursu'd he, <hi>your Mistriss must be
acquainted with this, and this very Night that they think to get
a great way by the help of the Moon, she must feign her self sick
at the first Village; then will they be oblig'd to stop; my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vane
shall make</hi> Saldagnes <hi>Men drunk. She shall afterwards
seem to recover, and then proceeding on in their Iourny, it will
be an easy matter for my Men to impose on the Drunkards, and to
make them believe that you come behind with their Charge, when
it shall be so contriv'd that you shall go a quite contrary way, and
so carry your dear</hi> Star <hi>clear off. Destiny</hi> found a great deal of
masterly Contrivance in this Proposal of <hi>Vervilles,</hi> and whose
Man, whom they had just then sent for, entred the Chamber
much at the same time. They consulted together what they
had to do, and agreed on all Points. Afterwards <hi>Verville</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired
with <hi>Destiny</hi> the rest of the Day, being unwilling to
part with him so quickly after so long absence, tho' he never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless
hop'd to see him again at <hi>Bourbon</hi> whither he vvas to go.
At length Night came and <hi>Destiny</hi> vvent vvith <hi>Verville</hi>'s Servant
to the place appointed. <hi>Saldagnes</hi> tvvo Men fail'd not to be
there likewise when <hi>Verville</hi> by <hi>Saldagnes</hi> order consign'd into
their Hands the Charge of Madam <hi>Star.</hi> You cannot ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
what Joy enflam'd these two Lovers Hearts at this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terview,
but speak they must not, and look languishingly they
dare not, so that their Passion might be well term'd inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressible.
They had not gone above half a League before
Madam <hi>Star</hi> began to complain. Her Attendants exhorted her
to take Courage till she came to a Town about two Leagues
off, where they gave her hopes she should rest. Her Malady
encreased at every Step, and <hi>Vervilles</hi> Man and <hi>Destiny</hi> did
all that in them lay to prevent <hi>Saldagnes</hi> Servants from mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusting
the reality of her Sickness so near to the place they set
out from. At last they arrived at the Tovvn, and immediately
vvent to the Inn (vvhereof there vvas but one in all the Place,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:53808:95"/>
which they happily found full of Guests and Drunkards. Madam
<hi>Star</hi> continued to grunt, and feign'd Sickness better by can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlelight
than she had done before. She called for a Bed and
lay down thereon in her Cloaths, requiring her Guards but
to leave her for an Hour only, and she did not question but
by that time she should be sit to get on Horse-back again.
They left her, and <hi>Saldagnes</hi> Servants left all other Matters to
the management of <hi>Vervilles</hi> Man, who had their Masters
Orders. For their parts they thought they had no more to
do than to make much of themselves, and in order thereto,
struck in with a jolly Company of roaring Boys, who were pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
round a Table, and who pelted one another with <hi>Healths</hi>
as thick as Hail-shot flies from the Mouth of a Demi-Culve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tih.
<hi>Vervilles</hi> Man would sometimes step in and take his Glass
to renew the Fight when there was like to be any Cessation.
His reason for often slinching, was because he had the care
of the Lady; but the truth on't was, he had a mind to get
an opportunity to mount her and <hi>Destiny,</hi> and to send them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
which he soon after did by By-roads; but therein va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     </gap>ied
from the Stratagem his Master had laid, as you may have
observ'd before. After he had so done, he returned to his
Drunkards, amusing them with flim flam Stories, and telling
them the Lady was for the present gone to sleep, but that she
would soon awake, and then they would be jogging on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
of their Journey. He told them likewise, that <hi>Destiny</hi>
was gone into the Stable to look after the Horses, but would
return presently. He then put about the Glass, and <hi>toasted</hi> se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Healths, all which <hi>Saldagnes</hi> Men took in Bumpers, till
at last their Heads grew so heavy, that they could not possibly
lift them from the Table. It was therefore they were fore'd
to be carried out, and thrown upon a lump of Straw in a
Barn, for Beds they were not to be suffer'd to lye upon, for

no Body took the least notice when <hi>Destiny</hi> and

his dear <hi>Star</hi> how she came to the Wood where <hi>Saldagne</hi>
seiz'd her, but this, tho' he would have willingly been satisfied
in, yet still had he more regard to their safeties, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

all the Expressions and Demonstrations of Love and Affection

                        </gap>

Wounds caused me a great deal of disquiet 'tis true, and now what
you tell me enclines me to believe that your Servant has been gain'd
over to our Enemies, out of some ill design they have projected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
us. He has rather been debauched,</hi> reply'd <hi>Destiny, by
some that are too much our Friends. I have no profess'd Enemy,</hi>
continued he, <hi>but</hi> Saldagne, <hi>and it is unlikely that he should have
seduced my Servant, because I know he beat him at the time that he
met with you. How came you to know that,</hi> said <hi>Star, for I don't
remember I ever told it you? You shall know,</hi> reply'd <hi>Destiny, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soon
as ever you have made me acquainted with the manner of your
coming from</hi> Mans. <hi>I can acquaint you with no more,</hi> quoth
<hi>Star, than what I have told you already. The Day after,</hi> proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
she, <hi>that my Mother</hi> Mrs. Cave <hi>and I came to</hi> Mans, <hi>your Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
brought me a Horse from you, and told me with Tears in his
Eyes, that you had been Wounded by the Ravishers of</hi> Angelica,
<hi>and that therefore you desired I would make all the haste I could to
you. I got on Horseback presently, for that purpose, altho' it was
very late. I lay about 5 Leagues from</hi> Mans, <hi>at a place whose
name I have forgot, and next Day at the entrance of a VVood,
we were stopt by Persons I did not know. I saw your Servant beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
and was extremely concerned at it, but could not hinder it. I
saw likewise a Woman suddenly thrown off from a Horse, and whom
I afterwards knew to be my Companion, but the great fright I was then
in, joined with the extraordinary concern I had for your safety,
made me to take little notice of it. They mounted me in the place
of her they had pulled off. We travelled till Night, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
having gone a great deal more Ground, for the most part
cross the Country, we arrived at a sort of Gentlemans House, where
I observ'd they would not receive us. It was there that I first
knew</hi> Saldagne, <hi>the sight of whom caused me immediately to
despair. We after that travelled a great way farther, and at
length I was secretly convey'd into the House where your Friend
found me.</hi> As Madam <hi>Star</hi> had just ended the Relation of
her Adventures, the Day began to appear, whereby they
perceiv'd they were in the high-wood that leads to <hi>Mans.</hi>
They forthwith whipt their Horses forwards, more vigorou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sly
than they had hitherto done, to reach a Town they saw
before them. <hi>Destiny</hi> desired earnestly to catch his Servant
and thereby to discover what other Enemy he had in that
Country besides his profest one <hi>Saldagne;</hi> but there was no
likely hood that he would suffer himself to light into his Clutches,
after the ill trick he had plaid him. He learnt from his dear
<hi>Star</hi> all that she knew concerning her Companion <hi>Angelica;</hi>
and while they were thus amusing each other with Questions
and Answers, their Horses started all of a sudden; at the sight
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:53808:97"/>
of a Man that lay at his full length under a Hedge. <hi>Desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny's.</hi>
Horse almost leap'd from under him, but Madam <hi>Star's</hi>
was so frighted, that he quite threw her off, violently upon the
Ground. After <hi>Destiny</hi> had recover'd himself, he went to
see how his <hi>Love</hi> far'd, but he could scarce alight to assist her
his Horse so snaffled and pranch'd, and tripp'd. At last he made
shift to leap off his Back, and found to his great Joy that
his dear <hi>Star</hi> had got no hurt. After which, the Horses be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
somewhat come to themselves, he went up to observe the
cause of their fright, and found it was a Man, whom he took
either to be dead or asleep. Upon a nearer view he saw he
was both, for he was dead Drunk; altho' his snoring shew'd
him to be alive, yet <hi>Destiny</hi> had no small trouble to awake
him. At length by often pulling and tearing him about, he
open'd his Eyes, and thereby discovered himself to his Master
to be his Servant, whom he had longed so much to find, The
Rogue as Drunk as he was, nevertheless knew his Master, and
by the fear he seem'd to have of him, betray'd his being Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of what he before doubted of. <hi>Destiny</hi> immediately ask'd
him several Questions successively, without waiting for Answers
till he had done. As first, <hi>Why he had told Madam</hi> Star <hi>that he
was Wounded? Why he carried her away from</hi> Mans? <hi>And whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he design'd to have carried her? By whose order he had the
Horse?</hi> and the like. To all which Questions, he nevertheless,
could not get a Word in Answer, either because the Rascal his
Man was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>o drunk to have the use of his Tongue, or else
by reason he feign'd himself to be so. This made <hi>Destiny</hi> to
fly into a great Passion, insomuch that having struck him two
or three Blows with the flat of his Sword, he took a Halter
and tied his Hands fast behind him, and fastned the other
e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> to the Crupper of his Horse, intending to make him march
in that manner to his Journies end. After which he mounted
<hi>Star</hi> upon her Horse again, and having snatch'd a good Cudgel
out of the Hedge, got up himself to proceed on his Journy, his
Man walking all the way by his side, like a Grey-hound in
a <hi>slip.</hi> The Town which <hi>Destiny</hi> saw before him, happen'd to
be the same that he had parted from two Days before, where
he had met Monsieur <hi>de la Garouffiere,</hi> and where his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
still remained, by reason of a greivous <hi>Colera Morbus</hi>
that Madam <hi>Bouvillon</hi> had had ever since. When <hi>Destiny</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
he found neither <hi>Rancour, Olive</hi> nor <hi>Ragotin,</hi> they having
all returned to <hi>Mans</hi> the Day before. As for <hi>Leander</hi> he had
never quitted in the least his dear <hi>Angelica.</hi> I need not tell
you after what manner she receiv'd Madam <hi>Star;</hi> it may be easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
guest at what Caresses two such Lovers would lavish away
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:53808:97"/>
upon each other, after so many dangers escap'd on either side.
<hi>Destiny</hi> immediately inform'd Monsieur <hi>de la Garouffiere</hi> of the
success of his Expedition, and a little after, his Man being
brought in, who was not yet unbound, he proceeds to ask
him the same Questions as before; but to which neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
the Rascal stood mute, as he had formerly done. This
Obstinacy of his, caused his Master to order a Hand-Vice to
be fetch't from the Gun-smiths, wherewith to squeeze his
Thumbs, and make him confess by those means. At the
fight of the Engine the Rogue immediately fell a trembling
and falling down on his Knees, begg'd heartily for Pardon,
Confessing at the same time, that <hi>la Rappiniere</hi> had set him
on to do what he had done, and that he had moreover pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
him for Recompence to take him into his Service.
He farther own'd that <hi>la Rappiniere</hi> was then at a House about
two Leagues off, which he had usurpt upon a poor Widow.
<hi>Destiny</hi> continued talking in private for some time with Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

<hi>de la Garouffiere,</hi> who soon after sent a Footman to let <hi>la Rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piniere</hi>
know that he would speak with him about an Affair
of Consequence. This Councellor of <hi>Rennes</hi> had it seems a
great Influence over the <hi>Provost</hi> of <hi>Mans.</hi> He had formerly

                  <p>IT was in <hi>Africa,</hi> among the Rocks by the Sea side, and
not distant from the famous City of <hi>Fez</hi> above half an
Hours Journey, that Prince <hi>Muley</hi> Son to the King of <hi>Morocco,</hi>
after having stray'd from his Companions while he was Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
happen'd to be left alone. The Sky was without the least
Cloud, the Sea calm, and the Moon and Stars shone out so bright,
that they in a manner Rival'd the Sun: In a Word, all these
agreeable accidents met together, made one of those Nights,
which in hot Countries, like this, are far more pleasant than
what we call the finest Daies in our <hi>Northern</hi> Regions. The
<hi>Moorish</hi> Prince Galloping along the Shore, diverted himself
with beholding the exceeding brightness of the Moon and Stars,
and which communicated their Splendour to the Water, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they were also to be seen as in a Mirrour. As he was
thus amusing himself, he heard several doleful Shrieks hard by

have your Life or loose my own.</hi> With that, he immediately
upon him, with that fury, that the Prince as Valiant as
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:53808:98"/>
was, thought less of Chastizing his Subjects Insolence than
defending his own Life. The two Women at the same time
were at Fisticuffs, and she that a Moment before had been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
over-power'd, was now become couragious, and kept her
Adversary from flying, hoping that her Champion would get
the Victory. Despair ever augments Courage, and oftentimes
gives it to those whose natural Timidity made them uncapable
of having it before. Altho' the Valour and Conduct of this
Prince were incomparably greater than those of his Adversary,
yet did the self-Conviction of this <hi>Moor,</hi> together with the
dread of Punishment, so animate his Spirits, and direct his
Arm, that the Combat remained for some time doubtful: But
at last Heaven, that always is ready to protect those it raises
above others, caused the Princes Attendants to come near that
way, who being allarum'd at the noise of the Combatants, and
the cries of the Women, immediately rid Post to see what
was the matter, and arrived just at the time, when their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
by a lusty blow, had brought his Enemy to the Ground.
They presently knew their Lord, and therefore run with great
Fury to have dispatcht his vanquish'd Adversary; but the
Prince calling out to them, bid them to forbear killing him, and
ordered them, only to tie him to a Horses Tail, it being his
Intentions to have him reserved for a more exemplary Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
Two of the Horse-men took up the two Women behind
them, and with this Equipage <hi>Muley</hi> and his Company return'd
to <hi>Fez</hi> much about Day-break. This young Prince commanded
in <hi>Fez</hi> as absolutely as if he had been already King. Soon
after his arrival, he commanded the <hi>Moor,</hi> whose name was
<hi>Amet,</hi> and Son to one of the richest Merchants in <hi>Fez,</hi> to be
brought before him; the two Women were order'd to be brought
likewise; but they were known to no Body, by reason of the
Custom of concealing that Sex, which is observ'd here stricter
than in any other Parts. She of the two whom the Prince had
reliev'd, surpriz'd both him and the Court with her Beauty;
it being so great, that all <hi>Africa</hi> had not the like to boast
of, and withall so Majestick, that even a Slaves Habit, which
she wore, could not obscure it. The other Woman was cloath'd
like to those of this Country, which are of some Quality, and
who likewise had Beauty, but which could not stand in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition
with that of the other, and had it been possible the
paleness of her Cheeks alone, occasion'd by her Fear, would
have lost her the Victory, when the other would have rather
received advantage by a guiltless Blush and a fearless Mind.
The <hi>Moor</hi> appear'd before <hi>Muley</hi> with Guilt in his Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
keeping his Eyes all the while fixt upon the Ground.
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:53808:99"/>
The Prince commanded him to confess his Crime, if he would
not die in Torments. <hi>I know those that are prepared for me,</hi>
answered he boldly, <hi>all which, and greater, I have deserved;
yet still, had I thought it would have been for my Advantage,
even the greatest could be inflicted on me, would not have been
able to have extorted the least Confession from me. But since I
know that nothing can avail to save my Life, seeing I would have
been the Instrument of your Death, Know, great Prince, that the
qnger I have conceived against my self for not having killed you,
torments me more than the utmost of Tortures can do. As for
these two</hi> Spanish <hi>Women here,</hi> added he, <hi>they have both been my
Slaves; whereof one who knew best how to play her Cards, has
married my Brother</hi> Zaide, <hi>when the other, more obstinate, would
never yet change her Religion, nor except the frequent Proffers of
Love which I have made her.</hi> Here he stopt, and would give no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
account either of them or himself, notwithstanding the great
Meanaces made him. This caused <hi>Muley</hi> to have him immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
thrown into a Dungeon loaded with Irons; the <hi>Renega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,</hi>
Wife of <hi>Zaide,</hi> was order'd to another Prison. But the
fair Slave the Prince commanded to be conducted to a <hi>Moors</hi>
House nam'd <hi>Zulema,</hi> a Man of Quality, and by birth a <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard,</hi>
but who had left that Country, because he would not
be forced to turn Christian. He was of the illustrious Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
of <hi>Zegris,</hi> heretofore so renown'd in <hi>Grenada,</hi> and his
Wife <hi>Zaraide,</hi> likewise of the same Lineage, was reputed to
be the finest Woman, whether for Beauty or Wit; in all <hi>Fez.</hi>
She was at first charm'd with the Beauty and Conversation
of this fair Christian Slave, and therefore, if she had been
capable of being Comforted, she might have found sufficient
Consolation in her Caresses; but on the contrary, as if she
had forsworn all manner of Comforts, she always desired to be
alone, thereby to give the better vent to her Grief; for when
she was in <hi>Zoraides</hi> Company, she underwent no small torture
by retaining her Sighs and her Tears. All this while Prince
<hi>Muley</hi> was very desirous of having an account of her Adventures.
He had made his Mind already known to <hi>Zulema,</hi> and who
being a Person from whom he could conceal nothing; he had
likewise acquainted him that he had a sort of Love for this
fair Christian, and which he would before have let her known
had not he apprehended from her great Afflictions some unknown
Rival in <hi>Spain,</hi> who might be too luckily prepossess'd of her
Favour. <hi>Zulema</hi> having receiv'd this hint from his Lord, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
gave Orders to his Wife to get what particulars she
could out of this fair Christian concerning her Life, but espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
how she came to be a Slave to <hi>Amet. Zoraide</hi> was
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:53808:99"/>
as desirous as the Prince of knowing these Particulars, and
therefore was not long before she set about it; she had little
reason to think she should be refus'd, because she had been so
wonderfully Civil to her. Agreeable to her Wishes the fair
<hi>Spaniard</hi> answer'd her, that she would satisfie her Curiosity when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
she pleased; but having nothing but Misfortunes to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
her with, she feared she would find her Relation some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
tiresom. <hi>You will be convinc'd,</hi> reply'd <hi>Zoraide, that is
cannot be so, when you see the attention I shall give to it, and by
the concern that I shall infallibly shew for your bad Portune. I
dare say you will be apt to believe you could entrust your Secrets
with no truer Friend.</hi> This said, they threw their Arms over
each other Necks, and embraced so heartily, as if they never
dosigned to quit that Posture. Afterwards the fair Slave wip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her Eyes. which shed Tears abundantly at the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of her Misfortunes, began her Story in the following
manner. <q>I am, said she, a <hi>Spaniard</hi> by Birth, was born at
<hi>Valencia</hi> and my name is <hi>Sophia.</hi> I was Educated with that
Care and Charge as would become a rich Father and Mother
to bestow on the first Fruits of their Marriage. I had a
Brother younger than I by a year. He was lovely as may
be, and loved me dearly, as I loved him; our mutual
Friendship was so great, that we were never easy when we
were asunder, aud therefore our Parents took care that we
should seldom be so. We learnt together all those Exercises
that are usually taught Youth of either Sex, and thence it
came to pass, to the surprize of every Body, that I was
equally skillful with him in the <hi>Manege</hi> as he was with me
in the Arts of the Needle. This extraordinary sort of Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of ours caused a Gentleman our Neighbour to desire
of my Father that his Children might be bred along with
us. His Request was granted, and having only a Son and
Daughter, about the Age of us, it gave occasion to the Town
of <hi>Valencia</hi> to think that there would one Day be a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Marriage between us. <hi>Don Carlos</hi> and <hi>Lucy,</hi> were the
Names of these two young Companions of ours. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
was handsom, and loved me dearly, which I reciprocal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
returned. Our Parents observ'd it, but were so far from
either disliking or opposing it, that they rather encouraged
and approved it, and I believe would certainly have soon
married us together, had not they thought us too young. At
length our delusive Happiness was stifled by the Death of
my Brother; a violent Feavour carried him off in eight Days,
and from his Death sprung the first cause of my Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes.
<hi>Lucy</hi> was so affected with it, that she obstinately re|'solv'd
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:53808:100"/>
to turn Nun. I had brought my self even to Deaths
door for Grief, and <hi>Don Carlos</hi> likewise had so great a share of
Concern, that he gave his Parents little hopes to believe he
would survive it, so much the loss of my Brother, the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
I was in, and the Resolutions of his Sister had wrought
upon him. At last, thanks to our Youth, we all recover'd, and
Time in some measure moderated our Afflictions. The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of <hi>Don Carlos</hi> died not long after, and left him both
Rich and out of Debt. His Riches furnisht him with Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
to gratifie his gallant Humour, and his Gallantry flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
my Vanity, expos'd his Love to publick knowledge,
and augmented mine. <hi>Don Carlos</hi> was often found at my Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
Feet, conjuriug them not to defer his Happiness any
longer, and my Father was inclinable to hearken to his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest,
for fear his profuse Courtship might in time di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minish
his Fortune; he gave him Hopes therefore, that he
should speedily be his Son-in-law. This raised <hi>Don Carlos</hi> to
so high a pitch, that he lavisht out his Love at an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
rate, and which would have been alone sufficient to have
convinced me of his Sincerity, had I not had so many preced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Proofs of his Passion. To add to his other profuseness,
he presented me with a Ball, and invited all the Town of
<hi>Valencia</hi> to it. But to his Misfortune as well as mine, thither
came among the rest, a <hi>Neapolitan</hi> Count, whom some Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
of Importance had brought into <hi>Spain:</hi> This Count it
seems, took so great a fancy to me, that he must needs be
in Love with me, and in order to gratific his Passion, was
not long before he demanded me in Marriage, after having
been inform'd of the quality of my Father, in the Kingdom
of <hi>Valencia.</hi> My Father was so dazl'd with the Title of
this Stranger, that he immediately consented to all he ask'd,
and from that very Hour, forbid <hi>Don Carlos</hi> to pretend any
more to me. He likewise strictly enjoined me to receive no
more of his Visits, and moreover Commanded me for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to look upon the <hi>Italian</hi> Count as a Person that was to
marry me at his return from <hi>Madrid,</hi> whither he was then
going, and would come back in a short time. I dissembled
my dislike for the present to my Fathers Proposals, but when
I was alone <hi>Don Carlos</hi> would sincerely come into my Mind,
whom I thought the most aimable Man in the World, while
I could not find with my utmost endeavours the least thing
agreeable, nay, scarce tolerable, in his Rival; so that it was
equally impossible for me to Love the one and to forget the
other. I had recourse upon this occasion to Tears, but sound
those a feeble remedy against so great a Malady as mine.
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:53808:100"/>
While I was in this Condition, <hi>Don Carlos</hi> entred the Room,
but that without his usual Custom of asking leave. He
found me all in Tears, which made him to lose the Power
of witholding his own, however great had been his Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions
not to betray the Sentiments of his Heart till he had
dived into the utmost of mine. He threw himself at my
Feet, and taking me by the Hand, which he all bathed with
his Tears, <hi>Sophy,</hi> said he to me, What must I loose you then?</q>
Must a Stranger who has scarce the Honour to be known to
you, be notwithstanding prefer'd to me? Shall he possess you
<hi>Sophy,</hi> and will you consent to it? You whom I have loved
so dearly, and who have always endeavoured to make me
believe that you loved me likewise? Shall your Father pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to dispose of you, when he has already given you me?
Your Father, the most unjust Man living! If you were a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
continued he, whose Merit could be valued, my Fidelity
alone would be able to purchase you. But, pursued he,
since you are inestimable, I beg you to believe that if I have
had the ambition to aspire to you, I shall not want the Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
to revenge my self on him whom you causeless prefer
to me. But however, added he sighing, If it be your plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
that my Rival should live happy in your Favour, I will
forego all attempts upon him, and only Revenge your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindness
upon my self by some cruel and suddain Death. <q>
                        <hi>Don Carlos,</hi>
answered I, will you join with an unjust Father, and
a hated Lover to torment me, and do you impute that to me
for a Crime, which is only a Misfortune common to us both?
Pity me, added I, instead of accusing me, and bethink of
means to preserve me yours, rather than reproach me with a
Fault I am no ways Guilty of. I believe I may have bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
reason to reflect on you for not having sufficiently loved
me, since I find you have not yet sufficiently known me. But
we have no time to lose in vain Words, continu'd I, carry
me whither you please, for you shall always find me disposed
to follow you. At these Words, <hi>Don Carlos,</hi> was more trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
with Joy than he had been before depressed with
Grief; and therefore having beg'd my Pardon for the inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
he had done me, he proposed to fetch me away the
Night following. For this purpose he spent all that Day
in ordering his Affairs. He got together a good Sum of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
and hired a <hi>Barcelona</hi> Vessel which would be ready to
put to Sea at what time he desired: For my part, young
as I was, I had Wit to manage the Secret so well, that no Body
ever so much as mistrusted us. I got all my Mothers Jewells,
and scrap'd up what Money I could get. At the Hour ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:53808:101"/>
                        <hi>Carlos</hi>'s his Page <hi>Claudio,</hi> waited for me at the Gate.
He told me that his Master had sent him to conduct me on
Board, and that he could not come himself, for Reasons he
would satisfie me in when he saw me. At the same time
came a Slave that belong'd to <hi>Don Carlos,</hi> and who was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
very well known to me, to accompany me. We got
easily out of the City, by means of the good contrivance we
had laid, and were not gone far before we saw a Vessel riding
in the Harbour, whose Boat waited for us on the Shore.
The Seamen told me that my dear <hi>Don Carlos</hi> would come
immediately, and that I had no more to do but to go into the
Boat. I was carried in by the Slave, but had no sooner
been set down, than I perceived the Seamen forcing in <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dio,</hi>
whom I observed to be unwilling to enter. This en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased my concern for the absence of <hi>Carlos,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
I immediately demanded of the Slave where he was.
He surlily answer'd, that wherever he was he was no more
for me. Having said this he left me, and in a little while
after, I heard <hi>Claudio</hi> above upbraiding the Slave after
this manner. Is it thus Traitor <hi>Amet</hi> that you perform your
Promise, to rid me of a Rival, and leave me with my Love?</q>
                     <hi>To which the Slave reply'd,</hi> Imprudent <hi>Claudia!</hi> am I oblig'd
to keep my Word with you, when yuu have not scrupled to
betray your Master, and how could I expect you would be
true to me, and not send the Guards out after me to take
my dear <hi>Sophy</hi> from me, whom I love more than my Life,
when I have observ'd how Villanously you have served both
him and her? <q>These Words spoken to a Woman whom I
took always for a Man. and concerning matters which I
knew nothing of, raised so fierce a discorder in me, that I fell
dead for the present, in the Arms of the perfidious <hi>Moor.</hi> By
that time my Fit was over, our Vessel had got a good way to
Sea. You can't imagine when I came to my self, what a
confusion I was in, for then I plainly perceiv'd I was in the
Hands of <hi>Moors,</hi> and Enemies to our Faith. I knew that
the Slave <hi>Amet</hi> had all sort of Authority, and that his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Zaide</hi> was Captain of the Vessel. <hi>Amet</hi> no sooner saw
me in a condition to hear him, but he made me a short de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
of his Love, professing he had had a kindness for
me a long time, and that his Passion was the cause of his
carrying me away. Moreover that he design'd to carry me
to <hi>Fez,</hi> where it should be my own fault if I were not as
happy, if not happier, than I could have been in <hi>Spain.</hi>
And lastly, he had the Impudence to urge to me, that he
did not doubt but in a short time I would have no reason to
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:53808:101"/>
regret the loss of <hi>Don Carlos.</hi> I had scarce patience to hear
him out, before I flew upon him with all the Vigour and
Courage that my Fit had left me, and by an Address
which I told you before I had learnt from my Education
snatching his Scymitar out of the Scabbard, I was going
to punish his Perjury with the loss of his Life, had not
his Brother <hi>Zaide</hi> timely stept in and provented me. I was
presently Disarm'd, for having once missed my blow I
could not possibly defend my self against so great a number
of Enemies. <hi>Amet,</hi> whom my unexpected Attempt had
frightned, commanded all but me to go out of the Room,
and afterwards followed himself. He left me in such a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
as you may imagine after so cruel a reverse had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd
to my Fortune. I spent all that Night in Tears, and
the Day following I nothing but greived and took on. Time
that generally alleviates other Peoples Misfortunes, had no
effect upon mine. The second Day was as Uncomfortable
to me as the first, or rather more tormenting, for when I
reflected upon the never seeing <hi>Don Carlos</hi> more, how could
I propose to my self any future Consolation? <hi>Amet</hi> always
found me so terrible whenever he offer'd to accost me, that he
came no more near me. From time to time they brought
me Victuals to eat, but which I refused with that obstina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
as made the <hi>Moor</hi> to fear that he had brought me
away to no purpose. In the mean time the Ship had pass'd
the <hi>Streights,</hi> and was not far off the Coasts of <hi>Fez;</hi> when
<hi>Claudio</hi> entring the Room, assoon as I perceived him, I began
with him after this manner. Villain, said I, you have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray'd
me, and what could induce you to so base an Action
after you had been so well used both by me and <hi>Don Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los?</hi>
                     </q>
you were too well beloved, answer'd he, and since I lov'd
<hi>Don Carlos</hi> likewise, what ill have I done in endeavouring to

he, <hi>Amet</hi> has also betray'd me, and I shall have as great
reason to lament as you, if I do not think of some way not
to remain alone miserable. 'Explain these Riddles, reply'd
I, and learn me who you are, that I may know of what Sex
I have you for my Enemy? <hi>Sophy,</hi> then continu'd he, I am of

<pb n="206" facs="tcp:53808:102"/>
have married me without disparagement; but his Mind was all
set upon you, and you were the only Object of his Vows and
Wishes. It was not but I endeavoured to make my Eyes
save the labour of my Tongue, and take the shameful Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of my Love upon them. I always laid my self in his way
and used all those little Artifices that he would have done to
Captivate me, had it been his own Case. I might have often
disposed of my self in Marriage to Advantage, had not the
hopes I had of one Day winning him over always prevented
my Fortune; Insomuch that instead of being discourag'd at
his repulse, I found them a means to love him the more. At
length, being resolv'd to neglect nothin that might serve to
bring him about, I put my self into Mans Apparel, and cut
my Hair, and so disguiz'd caus'd my self to be presented to
<hi>Don Carlos</hi> for a Page by an old Woman, who told him that
my Father was a poor Gentleman, that lived upon the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
of <hi>Toledo.</hi> My Face and Meen it seems pleased your Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so well, that he presently resolv'd to take me. He was as
well satisfied with my Wit as pleased with my Voice and
manner of Singing, as likewise with my skill in playing on
all sorts of Instruments that Persons of Quality are wont to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
themselves with. He believed he had met with Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in me that were not to be commonly found in Pages;
and I gave him so many Proofs of my Fidelity and Discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that he treated me more like his Friend and Confident
than Servant. This you are able to tostific better than any
Person breathing; and you know besides, how often you
have commended me to <hi>Carlos,</hi> both behind my Back and to
my Face, and likewise done me several other good Offices
with him, but I was mad to think that I must be indebted
for all these to a Rival, and that at the same time that
they render'd me more agreeable to <hi>Don Carlos,</hi> they made you
more Hateful to the unfortunate <hi>Claudia,</hi> (for so is my true
Name.) In the mean time your Marriage advanc'd and my
Hopes went back; but assoon as it was concluded they went
utterly lost. The <hi>Italian</hi> Count who became about that time
in Love with you. and whose Quality and Estate gain'd as
much upon your Father, as his bad Mien and Conditions
lost him in your Esteem, gave me nevertheless the Pleasure
to see you disturb'd and which caused me to flatter my
self with those Foolish hopes which change always offer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
to the unhappy. At last your Father preferr'd the Stranger
whom you loved not, to <hi>Don Carlos,</hi> whom you loved, and
I had then the satisfaction to see one that made me unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
unfortunate himself, and my Rival that I hated, yet
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:53808:102"/>
more unhappy. My Pleasure was only augmented when I
confider'd that I lost nothing in him, because he never was
mine, but that you were depriv'd of all in losing him, by
reason that he was all yours. But this imaginery Happiness
of mine, or to call it better, unfinish'd Hope, lasted not long.
I learnt from <hi>Don Carlos,</hi> that you were resolved to go away
with him, and I was employ'd for that purpose to hire s Ship
to carry you to <hi>Barcelona</hi> from whence you were to go, either
to <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Italy,</hi> I can't tell which. All the force I had hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
made use of to support me in my Misfortunes, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sook
me at this Moment, I could now bear against the torrent
of my unhappy Fate no longer, and therefore was forced to
yield to it. My Griefs upon this occasion were so great that
they made me downright Sick, and caused me to keep
my Bed. One Day as I was lamenting my hard Usage to
my self, and speaking louder than ordinary, out of a Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
that I was not over-heard, the <hi>Moor Amet</hi> appear'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
me, who after he had suffer'd me to recover out of the
surprize he had occasion'd in me. Address'd himself to me
in these Words. <q>I have known you <hi>Claudia,</hi> even before the
time that you disguiz'd your Sex to become Page to <hi>Don
Carlos,</hi> and if I have all this while conceal'd that knowledge
from you, it was because I had a Design to bring about as
well as you. I have overheard you enter into Resolutions of
Despair. You have a mind to discover your self to your
Master for a young Woman that dies for Love of him, and
afterwards to kill your self in his Presence, whereby you
think to incline his Pity, where you cannot otherwise engage
his Heart. Poor Girl! What advantage wilt thou get by
killing thy self, but assuring the possession of <hi>Carlos</hi> the firmer
to thy Rival? I have beter Advice to give thee, if thou hast
Courage enough to take it. Deprive thy Lover of <hi>Sophia;</hi> the
means of accomplishing it are easy; and tho' it requires a
good deal of Resolution, yet has it occasion for no more than
thou hast already had to Habit thy self like a Man, and
thereby to hazard thy Honour to content thy Love. Hearken
to me then with attention, continued the <hi>Moor,</hi> and I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal
to thee a Secret which I have never yet discover'd to any
Person, and if the Proposal I am about to make thee be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approv'd.
thou art at liberty either to receive or reject it.
I am of <hi>Fez,</hi> pursued he, and a Man of Quality in my own
Country. My Misfortunes made me a Slave to <hi>Don Carlos,</hi>
and the Beauty of <hi>Sophia</hi> made me the like to her. I have
told you a great deal of matter in few Words. Consider your
own Unhappiness without remedy if you suffer your Lover
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:53808:103"/>
to carry off your Mistriss to <hi>Barcelona</hi> It is both yours and my
Interest to prevent it, therefore let us lay hold on the occasion
that offers. I have bargain'd for my Ransom, and have paid
it. A Galliot from <hi>Africa</hi> waits for me in the Road, not far
off that which <hi>Don Carlos</hi> has provided for the Execution of
his Design. He has put it off for a Day longer, therefore let
us interpose our Project to carry her away before him, in
the aforesaid Galliot. In order to accomplish which, do you
go immediately to <hi>Sophia,</hi> as from your Master, and let her
know that he requires that she should depart this Night. For
this purpose bring her away forthwith to my Vessel, and I
will carry her to <hi>Africa;</hi> whereby you will remain behind a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
to possess your Lover, and who 'tis very likely will be
inclin'd to favour your Passion, when he understands what
you are, how well you love him, and moreover, that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of his <hi>Sophia</hi> is impracticable. At these last Words of
<hi>Claudias,</hi> continues <hi>Sophia,</hi> I became all of a sudden so oppress'd
with Grief, that I fainted away, and had scarce the least sign
of Life left. The cries that <hi>Claudia</hi> made for help, who it
may be now repented of what she had told me, brought <hi>Amet</hi>
and his Brother into the Room. They made use of all the means
that were proper to recover me, when coming at length to
my self, I heard <hi>Claudia</hi> still persisting to reproach <hi>Amet</hi> with
his <hi>Treachery.</hi> Infidel, <hi>said she to him,</hi> How could you have
the baseness both to betray me, and to bring this Lady
to the deplorable Condition you see her in? Or, How could
you have the Heart to make me Guilty of Treachery to the
Man I lov'd so dearly? How dare you report your self to
be Nobly born, when you are one of the very worst of Men?
Peace Fool! reply'd <hi>Amet,</hi> and do not accuse me of a Crime
to which you your self were Accessory. I have told you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
that one that could betray a Master like yours, well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
to be betray'd her self. I have proposed to carry you
along with me, both to secure my own Life, and to prolong
that of my dear <hi>Sophia,</hi> for I could easily guess what Tortures
she must necessarily have undergone had you remined behind
with her Lover discover'd. The noise the Seamen made at
their entrance into the Port of <hi>Sally,</hi> and the thundring of
the Cannon, as well from the Vessel as the Castle, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
any farther Reproaches between <hi>Amet</hi> and <hi>Claudia,</hi>
and at the same time deliverd me from the sight of those
two odious Objects. We landed, <hi>Claudia</hi> and I havaing our
Faces all cover'd with Vails, and were lodg'd in a House of a
Friends of the perfidious <hi>Amets.</hi> The next Day we were put
into a close Chariot and carried in that manner to <hi>Fez,</hi> where
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:53808:103"/>
if <hi>Amet</hi> was overjoy'd at the sight of his Relations and Friends'
I was no less afflicted and tormented at my Fate. As for
<hi>Claudia,</hi> she was resolved to make her self easy, for she quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
turn'd <hi>Mahometan,</hi> and married in a little time to <hi>Zaide,</hi>
Brother of the faithless <hi>Amet,</hi> This wicked Woman em<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>loy'd
all her cunning to persuade me to change my Religion like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
and to marry with <hi>Amet,</hi> as she had done with <hi>Zaide,</hi>
but I thank Heaven, I still persisted in my Constancy, both
to my first Faith, and my first Love. This caused <hi>Amet</hi> and
his Friends to use me with all manner of ill treatment; but
at last I was inclinable to believe that <hi>Claudia</hi> was not quite so
bad as she seem'd. In publick she Persecuted me indeed as much
or rather more than the rest, but in private she woul'd ever
now and then do me a good turn. One Day when all the
other Women were gone to the publick Baths, which you
know 'tis a custom amongst you <hi>Mahometans</hi> to do so many
times a Week, <hi>Claudia</hi> came to me in my Chamber, and with
a sorrowful Countenance accosted me in the following man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</q>
Fair <hi>Sophia,</hi> said she, whatever occasion I have hitherto
has to bear you ill Will is now an end, by reason of my
despair ever to possess him who loved me too little, because he
loved you too much. I condemn my self incessantly for hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

something unusual to my Sex. I can no longer live so remote

                     </gap>ives, <q>Hearing this Proposal of <hi>Claudia</hi>'s I immediately threw
my self at her Feet, and judging of her Sincerity by my own,
I made her all manner of acknowledgements both in Words and
Actions. Pursuant to our Project, we set a Time and Place
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:53808:104"/>
for our flight, and which last, was to be behind some Roch
by the Sea-side, where she told me the Vessel lay waiting for
us. On the Day appointed we set out, happily as I thought,
because we got so easily out of the House and City. I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir'd
the goodness of Heaven in favouring our escape with
such Facility, and more than once offer'd up my Thanks in
Acknowledgment. But however, the end of my Misfortunes
was not so near as I thought. What <hi>Claudia</hi> acted was only
by order of the perfidious <hi>Amet,</hi> than whom she yet more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidiously
led me to this abandon'd Place, for no other reason
than to expose me to the Lust of that wicked <hi>Moor,</hi> who durst
not attempt any Violence on me in his Fathers House, who
tho' a <hi>Mahometan,</hi> was Morally Honest. I followed Innocently
her that thus guided me to Ruin, and thought I could never
make her sufficient Acknowledgment for obliging me with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

that he might thereby avoid the baseness of tempting her. He
highly valued her for her Vertue, and was dispos'd by his own
to encourage and assist her in the Continuance of it; hereupon
he dispatch'd <hi>Zoraide</hi> to let her know, that he would send her
back to <hi>Spain</hi> assoon as ever she pleas'd; but not caring to trust
to the frailty of his Nature, he had at the same time resolv'd
to keep as much out of her sight as he could. <hi>Sophy</hi> for her
part was employ'd in thinking how to make her return as se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
as possible. She doubted if she should meet a Christian
Ship, which was nevertheless very difficult for her to do,
by reason that few or none traded hither, whether she should
not find as bad Men on Board it as she had done before a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the <hi>Moors.</hi> Sincerity is seldom observ'd on Board Vessels,
and good Faith minded as little among Seamen as amongst Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers.
Wherever Innocence and Beauty are met together Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence
will always take an occasion to Invade them. Whilst
she was thus debating with her self, <hi>Zoraide</hi> advis'd her to take
the Habit of a Man, and the rather, because her Shape was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
for that purpose: She told her also that it was <hi>Muley's</hi> Plea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sure
that she should do so, and who not being able to find a
Man in <hi>Fez</hi> with whom he could safely entrust her, had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
a Companion for her of her own Sex, who was to be
disguiz'd likewise, whereby they might both easily avoid the
Insolence of the Seamen and Passengers, if any were that way
inclin'd. This <hi>Moorish</hi> Prince had formerly purchaz'd a Prize
of a <hi>Corsair</hi> of <hi>Barbary.</hi> It was a Ship that had belong'd
to the Governour of <hi>Oran,</hi> which was carrying a <hi>Spanish</hi> Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
with his whole Family into <hi>Spain,</hi> and whom the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
had sent thither a Prisoner out of some disgust. <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi>
had been inform'd that this Christian was a great Hunter,
and as that Exercise was one of the choicest of his Diversions,
he was resolved to keep him to himself; but for fear to make
him uneasy, he order'd that he should not be separated from
his Wife, his Son and Daughter. In two Years time that he
liv'd in <hi>Fez,</hi> in <hi>Muley</hi>'s Service, he had taught that Prince to
Shoot admirably well, and that either sitting or flying. He
had moreover instructed him in several other ways of Hunting
unknown before to the <hi>Moors,</hi> By these means in a short time
he gain'd so far upon the Princes Favour, and became so Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable
to him in all his Diversions, that when a Ransom was
offer'd for him, he would by no means consent to part with
him, but rather made it his daily endeavour to oblige him, and
make him forget <hi>Spain.</hi> Notwithstanding this kindness of the
Prince, the regret he had to be out of his own Country, and
the unlikelihood of ever returning again, brought so deep a
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:53808:105"/>
Melancholy upon him, that it soon ended his Days. His Wife
likewise languish'd on the same account and lived not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
her Husband. When <hi>Muley</hi> saw how fatal his Favours to
these Strangers had been, he began to be touched with Remorse
and was exceeding sorry that he had not comply'd with their
Desires; but since it was now too late, he resolv'd to reward
the good Services of his Sportsman to his Children, and for that
purpose, immediately sent for them into his Presence. The
Daughter, whose name was <hi>Dorothy,</hi> was about the same Age
with <hi>Sophy,</hi> and had both Wit and Beauty. Her Brother nam'd
<hi>Sancho,</hi> was younger, being not above Fifteen; both were made
choice of by <hi>Muley</hi> to accompany <hi>Sophy</hi> to <hi>Spain.</hi> The Affair
for some time was kept Secret; three <hi>Spanish</hi> Habits for Men
were order'd to be got ready in the mean time. At length
<hi>Muley</hi> display'd his Magnificence in a great quantity of precious
Stones, which he gave to <hi>Sophy.</hi> To <hi>Dorothy</hi> and <hi>Sancho</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
he made several noble Presents, which together with what
their Father had left them, and which had been all obtain'd
from the Liberality of this Prince, made them to be consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
Rich. About the same time <hi>Charles</hi> V. made War upon
<hi>Africa,</hi> and had besieg'd the City of <hi>Tunis.</hi> He had sent an
Ambassador to <hi>Muley,</hi> to treat about the Ransom of certain
<hi>Spaniards</hi> of Quality, who had been Shipwrack'd on the Coasts
of <hi>Morocco.</hi> It was to this Ambassador that <hi>Muley</hi> recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
<hi>Sophy,</hi> under the name of a Man of Quality, called
<hi>Don Fernando, Dorothy</hi> and her Brother were said to be his At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants,
one passing for his Gentleman, and the other for his
Page. <hi>Sophy</hi> and <hi>Zoraide</hi> could not part without the greatest
reluctance. They shed abundance of Tears, and gave each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
unquestonable Proofs of a Reciprocal Affection. <hi>Zoraide</hi>
as a farther token of her Love and Esteem, presented the fair
Christian with a Necklace of Pearl, of that great value that
she would by no means have excepted it, had not <hi>Zulema,</hi> who
lov'd her no less than his Wife, acquainted her that they should
take it very unkindly if she refus'd what they tender'd only
as a Pledge of their Friendship. <hi>Zoraide</hi> made <hi>Sophy</hi> promise
to let them know from time to time how she did, either by
the way of <hi>Tangier, Oran,</hi> or the other Places which the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
then possess'd in <hi>Africa.</hi> The Christian Ambassador em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bark'd

on his Voyage to <hi>Spain,</hi> he was to go to wait on the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
at his Camp before <hi>Tunis.</hi> Our <hi>Spanish</hi> Lady in Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querade
was to be presented to him for a Gentleman of <hi>Anda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousia,</hi>
who had been a long time a Slave to the Prince of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocco
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:53808:105"/>
She had no such great Reason to be in Love with her
Life as to fear to hazard it in the Wars, and therefore since she
had took upon her the Character of a <hi>Cavalier,</hi> she was oblig'd
to go upon all Actions that Honour called her to. For this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
she placed her self among the <hi>Volunteers,</hi> resolving to lose
no occasion to signalize her self, and which she often did to that
degree, that her Valour came at length to the Emperour's Ear.
She happen'd to be in one Action, above the rest, wherein the
Emperour was unhorsed, and the Christians like to be beaten.
This our Valiant <hi>Amazon</hi> perceiving, by a Performance scarce
to be believed, she immediately remounted the Emperour, and
laid about her with that Conduct and Vigour, that she almost
opposed the whole Force of the Enemy, till such time as the
routed Army had rallied, and were come up to her Relief.
This wonderful Action of hers, did not go without its reward.
The Emperour in recompence presented to the unknown <hi>Don
Fernando,</hi> a <hi>Commandery</hi> of great Revenue, as likewise a Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Horse, which had belonged to a <hi>Spanish</hi> Colonel kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in the late Fight; he also gave him the Equipage of a
Man of Quality, and from that very time none were so much
esteem'd of in the Army as this Valiant Lady. All the actions of
a Man were natural to her. Her Countenance was so good,
and made her appear to be so Young; her Courage and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
were so far beyond her Years; her Wit was so charming
and Entertaining, that there was not one Man of Quality, or
Officer in the whole Army, but who either sought her Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
and Acquaintance, or humbly declin'd aspiring to it as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy.
It must not be wondred at then, since all the World
spoke so much for her, and yet more her renown'd Actions,
if she came to be so much in favour with her Prince. About
this time divers Recruits of Men and Amunition arriv'd from
<hi>Spain.</hi> The Emperour would have them all drawn up by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
that he might have a view of them, with the principal
Officers of the Army, amongst whom was our Female Warriour.
Among these new come Soldiers she fancied she had espy'd <hi>Don
Carlos,</hi> and as it happen'd she was not deceiv'd. This made her
to be uneasy all the remainder of that Day. She sent out often
to look after him, but could not find him, by reason he had
changed his Name. When Night came, she could not sleep a
wink, and therefore rise by Day-break to go in search of her
dear Lover, who had cost her so many Tears. At length she
found him, but was not known by him, by reason she was grown
taller, and had besides her Complexion much alter'd by the scorch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
heats of <hi>Africa.</hi> She made him believe she took him for
another of her Acquaintance, and began to ask him News
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:53808:106"/>
from <hi>Seville,</hi> as likewise concerning an imaginary Person that
came first into her Head. He told her he knew no such Person,
was never at <hi>Seville,</hi> and that he was born and liv'd in <hi>Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia.
You are nevertheless much like a Person that I knew and had
a great esteem for,</hi> reply'd <hi>Sophy, and therefore you must give me
leave to be ranked in the number of your Frieds. With all my
Hear,</hi> answer'd <hi>Don Carlos, and for the same reason you urge, I
must beg the like Liberty from you as you have done of me, for
you no less resemble a Person I loved long since, and do still love;
you have the same Visage and Voice, but you are not of the same Sex,
and certainly you cannot be of the same Humour,</hi> added he sigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
At these last Words of <hi>Carlos, Sophy</hi> could not forbear
blushing, which he nevertheless took no notice of, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
that he then had his Eyes over charged with Tears, which
hindred his observing her change of Countenance. This extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
Tenderness of <hi>Carlos</hi> mov'd her so extremely that she
was ready to discover her self, to prevent which at that time,
she desired him to come visit her in her Tent, and bid him to
enquire for <hi>Don Fernando.</hi> At the hearing of this name <hi>Don
Carlos</hi> began immediately to be affraid, well knowing what
Honours the Emperour had done that Person, and fearing he
might not have shew'd him sufficient Respect. He met with
little difficulty in finding the Tent, for it was but what every
body could direct him to. He was there received with all the
civility that a private Gentleman could expect from a general
Officer. He again discover'd the Countenance of <hi>Sophy</hi> in that
of <hi>Don Fernando,</hi> but was more amazingly surpriz'd at the resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
of their Voices, which immediately sunk into his Soul,
and brought to his Remembrance the Idea of the Person in the
World that he lov'd best. <hi>Sophy</hi> yet unknown to her Lover,
made him to Dine with her, and after Dinner commanding
her Domesticks to retire, and giving Orders that she would
be seen by no more Visiters, she caus'd him to tell her over
again that he was of <hi>Valencia,</hi> and afterwards occasion'd him
to relate all the Adventures that had happen'd between him and
her, which to be sure she knew as well as he, from their first
Acquaintance to the time of his Contrivance for carrying her
away. <hi>Would you believe,</hi> quoth <hi>Don Carlos, that a Woman of
her Quality, who had received so many Proofs of my Love, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
me reciprocally as many of hers, could yet be so void of Sense
or Honour to prefer a young Page, who had little or nothing to
boast of, to his Master?</hi> But are you sure of what you say? re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
<hi>Sophy;</hi> Chance often controuls our Designs, and oftener
takes pleasure to confound our reasoning with Events the least
expected. Your Mistriss may have been forc'd to leave you,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:53808:106"/>
continu'd she and is, it may be, more Unfortunate than Blam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.
<hi>Would to God,</hi> answer'd <hi>Don Carlos, that I could in the
least doubt of her Guilt! All the Misfortunes which I have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
undergone on her account would be easy to me, could I but
believe her still Faithful. But alass! she is only so to the Traytor</hi>
Claudio, <hi>and pretended an Affection to</hi> Don Carlos <hi>but to ruin
him.</hi> 
                     <q>It seems to me, <hi>reply'd</hi> Sophy, that you could but have
little kindness for her, since you can thus condemn her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard.</q>
                     <hi>Can I have greater Proofs of her Baseness,</hi> cry'd <hi>Don
Carlos, than appears by a Letter she sent her Father the Night she
went off; whereby I suppose she thought to take away all suspicion
of her going away with the Page. But to the end you may be
the better Iudge of it,</hi> added he, <hi>I have the Letter to shew;</hi> then
he read the Letter, which was in the following Words.</p>
                  <floatingText type="letter">
                     <body>
                        <head>The Letter.</head>
                        <p>YOU ought not, Sir, to forbid my loving <hi>Don Carlos,</hi>
since you had once commanded me to do it. A De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert
so great as he has to pretend to, must needs Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
the wariest Heart; and where so much Worth and
Merit reigns, Interest must not think to get place. I fly
then away with him whom you have thought fit I should
Love from my Youth upwards, and without whom it is
as impossible for me to live, as it would be not to greive
my self to Death in the Arms of a Stranger I hate, altho'
he were yet Richer than he boasts himself to be. Our Crime
therefore, if any, deserves at least your Pardon, which
if you are dispos'd to afford us, we will return as will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
to receive as we have shewn Disposition to retreat
from the unjust Violence you would do us.</p>
                        <closer>
                           <signed>SOPHIA.</signed>
                        </closer>
                     </body>
                  </floatingText>
                  <p>
                     <q>You may imagine, proceeded <hi>Carlos,</hi> what a Hurricane this
raised in the old Peoples Breasts. They hop'd I was either yet
in <hi>Valencia</hi> conceal'd with their Daughter, or else that I was
not far off from it, They kept their loss a Secret to every
body but the <hi>Vice-Roy,</hi> who was their Relation. I was sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd
to find the Constable and his Mirmidons enter my Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
at Day-break, rudely asking me for <hi>Sophy,</hi> and whom I
having demanded the same Question of, they immediately
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:53808:107"/>
hurried me away in a violent manner to Prison. I was
Question'd, and yet could say nothing in my Defence concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Sophy's</hi> Letter; it thereby appear'd that I was to carry
her away, but it was likewise manifest that my Page dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appear'd
also. <hi>Sophy's</hi> Relations made all imaginable search
after her, and my Friends did what they could to find whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Page had carry'd her, which they were certain he
must have done somewhither. At length it being found im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to meet with either one or th'other, which was the
only thing that could have clear'd my Innocence, I was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused
by my Enemies of Murdering both. Hereupon I had
notice given me that I must soon come to my Trial, and that
if I escap'd it was more than any Body expected. I knew the
home-Proofs they had against me, and hop'd only for a Mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acle
from Heaven to acquit me; but at last Despair got the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-hand,
and my Hopes consequently vanish'd. I resolv'd
therefore, not caring to trust my deliverance to the course of
Justice, to join with some Highway-Men, my Fellow Prison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
in the execution of a design they had laid to procure it
for us all. Accordingly we one Night forc'd the Gates of our
Prison, and by the assistance of our Friends, got to the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
that were nearest <hi>Valencia,</hi> before the <hi>Vice-Roy</hi> could
possibly be inform'd of our Escapes. We here continued a
long time Masters of the Roads. My <hi>Sophy's</hi> Infidelity, and
her Parents merciless Prosecution, together with the loss of my
Estate and Reputation, made me so desperate, that I car'd not
at what rate I hazarded my Life, and therefore in all cases
of resistance I behav'd my self with so great Resolution, that
my Companions thought fit to chuse me for their Captain. I
continued in this Post so succesful for some time, that our
Troop became formidable even to the Kingdoms of <hi>Arragon</hi>
and <hi>Valencia,</hi> which Countries we were so bold as to put un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Contribution. I herein make you acquainted, continu'd
<hi>Carlos</hi> to <hi>Sophy,</hi> with a Secret that concerns my Life, but the
Honour you have done me of your Friendship, and the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
I have of your Integrity, makes me not to doubt in the
least of my security. At length, proceeded he, I was weary
of this wicked course of Life, and forsook my Companions
at a time when they least expected it. I made my way for
<hi>Barcelona,</hi> where I listed a private Trooper in the Recruits
that were just then raising for <hi>Africa.</hi> I had hitherto had no
grreat reason to be in love with Life, and therefore having
made so ill use of it as to infest my Country. I thought
I could not do better than to employ the remainder of
my Days in its Service, and more especially seeing the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:53808:107"/>
I have received at your Hands, has been the only Comfort
I have had since I have been made the most miserable of Men,
by the most ungrateful Woman in the World. The unknown
<hi>Sophy,</hi> hereupon took the part of <hi>Sophy</hi> unjustly accus'd, and
omitted nothing to persuade her Lover against passing rash
Judgments on his Mistriss, before he was thorowly inform'd
of her Crime.</q> She told the unfortunate Gentleman moreover,
that she was very sensible of his Misfortunes, and would do
all that lay in her power to alleviate them; and to give him
a better Proof of her good Will, than what lay in Words, she
desired of him to come and be with her, and that assoon as
occasion serv'd, she would employ all her own and her Friends
Interest with the Emperour, to get him deliver'd from the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution
of <hi>Sophy's</hi> Parents, as likewise from that of the <hi>Vice-Roy</hi>
of <hi>Valencia. Don Carlos</hi> was not at all mov'd with what
the Counterfeit <hi>Don Fernando</hi> could say to him concerning the
justification of <hi>Sophy,</hi> but to accept of the offers of his Table
and House he was. The same Day this faithful Lover spoke
to <hi>Don Carlos's</hi> Captain to permit him to come and serve un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
him, I should have said, her. Now was our Lover under
the command of his Mistriss, whom he took to be either dead
or Faithless. He was very easy from the begining under this
new Commander, and would often wonder how he came to be
so much in her Favour in so short a time. He was at once her
<hi>Intendant,</hi> Secretary, Gentleman and <hi>Confident.</hi> The other Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mesticks
paid not a greater respect even to <hi>Don Fernando</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
than they did to him, and he would no doubt have been
exceeding happy had not the <hi>lost Sophy</hi> the <hi>treacherous Sophy,</hi> come
so often into his Mind. Whatever kindness <hi>Sophy</hi> had for him,
she always took a great deal of Pleasure to see him griev'd,
not doubting but it was upon her account. At last she had
justified <hi>Sophy</hi> so often, and sometimes with that heat, that
<hi>Don Carlos</hi> came to suspect that she had either been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
her Lover, or was so still. These Wars in <hi>Africa</hi> end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
as you may read in the History. These Emperour afterwards
made them in <hi>Germany, Italy, Flanders,</hi> and other Places. Our
experienc'd She-Warriour, under the name of <hi>Fernando,</hi> still
kept up, or rather encreas'd her Reputation for Courage and
Conduct, tho' the last of these qualities be seldom to be met
with in a Person so young as this valiant Lady's Sex made
her to appear. The Emperour was oblig'd to go into <hi>Flanders,</hi>
and for that purpose demanded leave of the King of <hi>France</hi>
to pass through his Dominions. The great King that then reign'd
in that Country, had a Mind to excel in Generosity a Mortal
Enemy, who had always surmounted him in Fortune, tho' he
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:53808:108"/>
had not made the best use of it. <hi>Charles</hi> V. was received in
<hi>Paris</hi> with as great Magnificence as if he had been King himself.
The brave <hi>Don Fernando</hi> was one of the small number of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of Quality that attended him, and 'tis more than likely,
that if he had continued long at that Court, this fair <hi>Spanish</hi>
Lady, being taken for a Man, would have enamour'd all the
<hi>French</hi> Ladies, and raised Jealousie in the most accomplish'd of
Courtiers. While this happen'd, the <hi>Vice-Roy</hi> of <hi>Valencia</hi> died
in <hi>Spain. Don Fernando</hi> through his great Merit and Interest
with the Emperour, doubted not but he should quickly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that charge, and as he thought, so it soon after fell out,
for he had no sooner ask'd than he had it given him, without the
least opposition from any Competitor. This his good success he
immediately thought fitting to acquaint <hi>Don Carlos</hi> with, and
at the same time gave him reason to hope, that assoon as he
was gotten into possession of his new Employment, he would
not only reconcile him with <hi>Sophy's</hi> Relations, and procure him
Pardon of the Emperour, for having been chief of the <hi>Vando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leros,</hi>
Highway-men, but likewise undertake to restore him to
his Lands and Estate. <hi>Don Carlos</hi> might very well have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
comfort from these Promises of his Friend, had not his
Love made him uncapable of it. The Emperour soon after
arriv'd in <hi>Spain,</hi> and went directly to <hi>Madrid,</hi> while <hi>Don Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nando</hi>
made what hast he could to his new Government. From
the very Day after his arrival in <hi>Valencia, Sophy's</hi> Friends
continually pester'd him with Petitions against <hi>Don Carlos,</hi> who
at the same time was both his Steward and Secretary. The
<hi>Vice-Roy</hi> promis'd to do them speedy Justice, but at the same
time let <hi>Carlos</hi> privately know, that he would not fail to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect
his Innocence. The Cause was quickly prepar'd for
Hearing, and in five or six Days time both Parties were ready
to go to Tryal. The Prosecutor demanded of the <hi>Vice-Roy</hi> that
the supposed Criminal might be sent to Prison, but which <hi>Don
Fernando</hi> would not nevertheless consent to, giving instead there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
his Word, that he should not stir out of his House till the Day
assign'd for the Tryal came. The Night before that fatal Day
which kept the whole City of <hi>Valencia</hi> in suspence, <hi>Don Carlos</hi>
desir'd a private Audience of the <hi>Vice-Roy,</hi> and which being
granted, he threw himself at his Feet, and broke out into the
following Words. 'To Morrow my Lord, quoth he, you will
be able to let the World know that I am Innocent; and altho'
some of the Witnesses that you have already heard in my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
clear me absolutely of the Crime; yet I do here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
to Swear once more to your Highness, as Religiously as I
would do before God at the sacred Altar, That I not only have
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:53808:108"/>
not carry'd away <hi>Sophy,</hi> as my Adversaries maliciously alledge
against me, but likewise did not lay Eyes on her from the
Day before she was so carried away, and have never heard the
least News of her since. I own I was to have carried her
away, continued he, had not a Misfortune too obscure for
me to unriddle prevented me in that Design. <hi>Enough,</hi> Don
Carlos, reply'd the <hi>Vice-Roy, go to Bed and take your rest; I
am both your Master and Friend, and perhaps am better inform'd
of your Innocence than you can imagine. You are come along with
me from</hi> Africa <hi>under my Protection, and I will not fail to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
and clear you against all your Enemies in this matter. Don
Carlos</hi> after having return'd his most-hearty Thanks to so ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging
a Master, went to Bed, but could not sleep for think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on what was to ensue. He got up by Day-break, and
dressing himself more gallant than ordinary, went to wait
on the <hi>Vice-Roy</hi> at his <hi>Levée;</hi> but I should mistake if I told
you that he entred the Chamber before she was drest. The before
mentiond <hi>Dorothy</hi> that came with her disguiz'd from <hi>Fez,</hi> still
continu'd to be her <hi>Confidente</hi> and Companion, and did those
Offices for her, which if another had done, she must have
quickly been discover'd. <hi>Don Carlos</hi> therefore gained not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance
till <hi>Dorothy</hi> had set open the Door, as well to him as
any Body else. The <hi>Vice-Roy</hi> no sooner perceiv'd him than
he began to reproach him with rising so early, alleging that
his not sleeping was no great token of his innocence. To which
<hi>Don Carlos,</hi> being a little disturb'd, reply'd, that the fear of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Convicted did not so much hinder him from sleeping, as
the hopes he had of soon seeing himself deliver'd by the Justice
his <hi>Highness</hi> would do him. 'But you are mighty Spruce and
Gallant, quoth the <hi>Vice-Roy;</hi> Nay, seem indifferent even on the
Day that you are to be try'd for your Life. I know not what
to think of the Crime you are accus'd of. As often as we
discourse of <hi>Sophy,</hi> you seem more negligent and unconcern'd
than I, who am no party, nor ever have been suspected to
have been belov'd by her, nor to have made away with her and
possibly the young <hi>Claudia</hi> likewise, as you have been. You say
you have lov'd her, continu'd the <hi>Vice-Roy,</hi> and yet you survive
the loss of her, and endeavour nothing so much as to get your self
acquitted, that you may forget her, and live at ease; you that
ought rather to hate Life, and destroy those very Charms
that have render'd you so aimable to her. Ah! inconstant
<hi>Don Carlos,</hi> proceeded he, It may well be suspected that you
have some other Love to supply the place of <hi>Soply</hi> you have
been so much oblig'd to. At these Words <hi>Don Carlos</hi> in a
great agony was going to Answer, but which the <hi>Vice-Roy</hi> not
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:53808:109"/>
thinking fit to hear, interrupted him in, and with a severe
Countenance said to him, <q>Hold your Peace, and reserve that
Eloquence which you are about to make use of here for your
Judges. As for my part I shall give little Ear to it, and I
will not for the sake of one of my Servants, let the Emper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
have reason to have an ill Opinion of my Justice. In
the mean time, continued he, turning towards his Guards, let
some one of you secure his Person. I should indeed be very
imprudent, added he, to believe that one who had broke
Prison would not seek to avoid Justice by his flight.</q> This
said, <hi>Don Carlos's</hi> Sword was immediately seiz'd, which rais'd
a great deal of Pity in the standers by, to observe what a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
change of Fortune he had undergone. While the poor Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
was repenting of confiding too much in great Mens
Favours, his Judges entred the Chamber, and took their places
after the <hi>Vice-Roy</hi> had seated himself. The <hi>Italian</hi> Count who
yet continued at <hi>Valencia,</hi> together with <hi>Sophy's</hi> Father and
Mother, appear'd against him, and produc'd their Witnesses,
whilst <hi>Carlos</hi> was almost ready to despair of his Cause, and
had scarce the Courage to Answer. They alleg'd the Letters
that he had formerly writ to <hi>Sophy,</hi> and prov'd his Hand;
they he had formerly writ to <hi>Sophy's</hi> Servants with him,
and lastly they produc'd against him the Letter which she had
written to her Father the Night before the Day on which they
pretended he had carried her away. <hi>Carlos</hi> caus'd his Servants
to be heard likewise, who Swore that they saw their Master
go to Bed; but then he might have risen again afterwards,
which they could give no account of. In his Defence he said,
That it was not likely that he should carry her away to
live separate from her, and much less that he would Murther one
whom he had always lov'd so dearly. But all this avail'd him
not, for Sentence was just going to be pronounc'd against him
when the <hi>Vice-Roy</hi> commanding him to be brought nearer him,
said to him, <q>Unfortunate <hi>Don Carlos!</hi> you may well think
from all the tokens of Friendship I have shew'd you, that if
I had in the least suspected you had been guilty of the
Crime you were accus'd of, I would never have brought
you to <hi>Valencia.</hi> But now, after what has been so plainly
prov'd against you, I am more than oblig'd to Condemn you
if I would not begin the Execution of my Office by Injustice.
You may easily be convinc'd of my concern for you by the
Tears that unavoidably come into my Eyes. If your Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutors
were not of that Quality they are of, I might be
inclinable to think they were byassed by Malice, but as they
are, there are no Exceptions to be made to them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:53808:109"/>
if <hi>Sophia</hi> does not appear suddenly her self to release you,
I am to give you notice that you must prepare for Death.</q>
                     <hi>Carlos</hi> despairing at these Words to be saved, threw himself at
the <hi>Vice-Roys</hi> Feet, and after some time, said to him, <hi>You may
remember, my Lord, that all the while I have had the Honour to
serve your</hi> Highness <hi>both in</hi> Africa <hi>and here, as often as you have
engag'd me in the tedious recital of my Misfortunes, I have always
told them after the same manner, and you may likewise be assur'd
that what I have told you, that have been so good a Master to me,
I would scorn to deny afterwards before any Iudge. I have all along
told your</hi> Highness <hi>the Truth as I would have done to my God, and
therefore I shall not stick to repeat what I have so often profess'd,
that I not only ever have, but also ever shall to my Lives end Love
and adore</hi> Sophy. <q>What say you? Interrupted the <hi>Vice-Roy,</hi>
with Concern in his Countenance) do you pretend to adore
her?</q> 
                     <hi>I do,</hi> reply'd <hi>Don Carlos,</hi> not a little surpriz'd at the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of the Question, <hi>and have not only promiss'd to marry her, but
likewise to carry her off to</hi> Barcelona. <hi>But if I have carried her
away, or know where she is at present, may I be put to the cruellest
of Deaths. As for dying,</hi> continued he, <hi>I know it is impossible
for me now to escape it, but I shall nevertheless dye innocent, if it
be not a Crime to have lov'd so faithfully, so Persidious and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constant
a Woman.</hi> 
                     <q>But cry'd the <hi>Vice-Roy,</hi> with a stern Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
What is become of this Woman and your Page? Are
they mounted up to Heaven? Are they conceal'd in the Earth?
Or whether are they gone?</q> 
                     <hi>The Page,</hi> answer'd <hi>Don Carlos, was
a spruce Gallant, and she a fine Lady; he was a Man and she
a Woman.</hi> 
                     <q>Ah Traytor! reply'd the <hi>Vice-Roy,</hi> now you dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
your base Suspicions, and the small esteem you enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
for the unfortunatd <hi>Sophy.</hi> Curs'd be that Woman
continued he, that confides in the Promises of Men, and suffers
her self to be abus'd by too easy a Belief. Neither was <hi>Sophy</hi>
a Woman of common Vertue, added he, nor your Page <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dio</hi>
a Man. <hi>Sophy</hi> was a constant Maid, and your Page a
ruin'd Woman that had been in Love with you, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
stole away and betray'd her as a Rival to her, I
am <hi>Sophy,</hi> unjust and ungrateful Lover! Proceeded he, I am
<hi>Sophy</hi> who have undergone incredible Hazards and Hardships
on the account of a Man that deserves not to be so well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lov'd,
since he could think me guilty of the very worst of
Treacheries.</q> 
                     <hi>Sophy</hi> found it not in her power to say any more.
Her Father immediately knew her, and catch'd her up into
his Arms, her Mother Swoon'd away on one side, and her
Lover <hi>Don Carlos</hi> on the other. She soon disengag'd herself
from her Fathers embraces, to run to the two that were fainted
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:53808:110"/>
away, and who coming quickly to themselves, she was in
doubt which to embrace first. Her Mother all bedew'd her
Cheeks with Tears, and she return'd the like. She embrac'd
her Dear, <hi>Don Carlos,</hi> with all the Passion imaginable, and
who was like to have swoon'd away again with the excess of
it. He nevertheless held her fast, and not yet daring to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
her Lips, he endeavour'd to satisfie himself on her Hands,
both which be kissed above a thousand and a thousand times
<hi>Sophy</hi> was scarce able to withstand all the Kindnesses and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements
made her. The <hi>Italian</hi> Count on his part going to
profer his, still insisted on his former Pretensions to her, as
being promis'd him both by her Father and Mother; this <hi>Don
Carlos</hi> hearing, and having at the same time one of her Hands
greedily kissing at his Mouth, he instantly quitted it, and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Hand on his Sword, which had been just then brought
him, he put himself into a posture enough to have frighted
an Army, and swore that rather than suffer himself to be
depriv'd of his dear <hi>Sophy,</hi> provided she would still continue to
Love him, he would hew down the City of <hi>Valencia,</hi> and bury
its Inhabitants in its Ruins. She on her part declared she would
have no other Husband but her dear <hi>Carlos,</hi> and therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd
both her Father and Mother either to resolve to approve
of him, or to expect to see their only Daughter speedily Cloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster'd
up in a <hi>Convent.</hi> Her Parents hereupon soon gave her
liberty to make choice of what Husband she pleas'd, which
the <hi>Italian</hi> Count perceiving he immediately took Post and rid
away for <hi>Italy. Sophy</hi> afterwards gave an account of all her
Adventures, which being so very extraordinary, were admir'd
at by every body. A Courier was soon after dispatch'd to
carry the News of this wonderful Discovery to the Emperour,
who thereupon sent Orders that <hi>Don Carlos,</hi> after he had married
<hi>Sophy,</hi> should be invested with the <hi>Vice-Royship</hi> of <hi>Valencia;</hi> and
moreover as a recompence for all the great Services his Lady
had perform'd under the name of <hi>Don Fernando,</hi> he gave to this
happy Lover a Principality, which his Heirs enjoy to this Day.
The City of <hi>Valencia</hi> was at the charge of the Wedding, which
was perform'd with all the Magnificence and Splendour ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable,
and <hi>Dorothy</hi> who had resum'd her Female Habit much
about the same time with <hi>Sophy,</hi> was married not long after her
to a near Relation of <hi>Don Carlor's.</hi>

                  <head type="sub">A matchless piece of Impudence in the Sieur de la
Rappiniere.</head>
                  <p>THE Councellor of <hi>Rennes</hi> had just done reading his No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel,
when <hi>la Rappiniere</hi> arriv'd at the Inn. He entred
the Room boldly, where he had been told Monsieur <hi>de la
Garrouffiere</hi> was, but assoon as he perceiv'd <hi>Destiny</hi> standing
in a corner, both he and his Man that came along with him
began visibly to change their Countenances. <hi>La Garrouffiere</hi>
after having shut the Door, demanded of the bold <hi>la Rappiniere</hi>
if he could not guess upon what account he was sent for, <q>Is
it not upon account of a Comedian, reply'd the Villain
laughing, whom I had a mind to have my share of?</q> 
                     <hi>How do
you mean your share,</hi> answer'd <hi>la Garouffiere</hi> with a serious Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
<hi>Does it become a Iudge as you are to talk after that
rate? And did you ever yet condemn a Person to be hang'd that
deserv'd it more than your self?</hi> La Rappiniere continu'd to turn
the thing to Ridicule, and would needs make it pass for the
Act of a good Companion. But the Senator urg'd it so home
to him, and after so severe a manner, that he at last forc'd
him to confess that it was an ill Action, and for which he
immediately made some trifling Excuses to <hi>Destiny,</hi> who not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
could scarce forbear calling him to an account
for offending him so basely, after he had been oblig'd to him
for his Life, as you may find he had been in the beginning
of these Comical Adventures. But <hi>Destiny</hi> had another Quarrel
to debate with this wicked <hi>Provost</hi> of greater Consequence,
which he had communicated to Monsieur <hi>de la Garrouffiere,</hi>
and who had promis'd to make him give him satisfaction.
Whatever Pains I have taken to dive into <hi>la Rappiniere,</hi> I could
never yet discover whether he were more wicked towards God,
or towards Man; more unjust to his Neighbour, or more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
in himself. I know only this to be true, that never any
Man had more Vices heap'd up together, nor in a more eminent
Degree than he. He confest he had had a Design to carry away
Madam <hi>Star</hi> as boldly as if he had reason to boast of a good
Action, and farther, he impudently told the Councellor and the
Comedian, that he never in the least doubted of the success
of that enterprize, <q>For, continued he, addressing himself to
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:53808:111"/>
                        <hi>Destiny,</hi> I had gained over your Man, and your Sister, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
you were Wounded, was so conveniently caught in the
Trap, in expectation to find you not above two Leagues from
the place where I waited for her, that I had certainly had
her, had not the Sot that Conducted her suffer'd some De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
or other to take her from him, whereby I lost a good Horse,
and he got a good beating.</q> 
                     <hi>Destiny</hi> at the hearing of this,
at first grew pale with Anger, but then presently blushed with
Shame to hear a Villain tell him that with indifferency which
he ought to have done with the greatest reluctancy and regret.
<hi>La Garrouffiere</hi> was greatly offended likewise, and was not less
Angry with so dangerous a Man. <q>I can't imagine, said <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>he
to him, how you could have the Impudence to tell us the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
of so base an Action with so much unconcern; for
which Monsieur <hi>Destiny</hi> would have nevertheless rewarded
you had not I interpos'd and hindred him. But I would
advise you, continued he, to restore to him the Box of Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds
you stole from him at <hi>Paris,</hi> when you were a Pick
Pocket Rascal, or he may yet do it. <hi>Doguin</hi> who was at
that time your Accomplice, and since your Servant, confest to
him on his Death-Bed, that you had it; and I declare to
you, added he, that if you do not speedily let him have it
again, I will for the future prove as dangerous an Enemy
to you, as I have hitherto been a serviceable Friend.</q> 
                     <hi>La
Rappiniere</hi> at these Words stood as if he had been Thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struck,
and had not power to deny any longer, according to
his usual Custom, what he had done. He own'd therefore,
stammering like one that was confounded, that he had the Box
at <hi>Mans,</hi> and Swore horribly to return it upon Demand. The
use he made of Oaths was out of Policy to conceal the Truth,
for tho' it was true that he had the Box, yet had he it not
at <hi>Mans,</hi> but carried it always about him, with design to
have presented it to Madam <hi>Star,</hi> in case she rejected his Amour.
This he afterwards confest in private to Monsieur <hi>de la Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouffiere,</hi>
thinking thereby to regain his Favour, and into whose
Hands he put the Box and Picture to dispose of as he thought
fit. The Picture was that of Madam <hi>Stars</hi> Father, set round
with Diamonds, whose Face it seems so much resembled hers,
that she might be easily known to her Father by it. <hi>Destiny</hi>
at the receipt of the Picture, knew not how to thank Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>de la Garrouffiere</hi> sufficiently for it. When this Box was
taken away from <hi>Destiny,</hi> he was not so much concern'd on
his own account, as on that of Madam <hi>Stars</hi> Mother, who
had a long time kept it as a Pledge of her Husbands Love.
You may easily guess then what an excess of Joy the recovery
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:53808:111"/>
of it raised in them both. He for his part went immediately
to acquaint his dear <hi>Star</hi> with the News, and whom he found
where he had left her in the Curate of the Town's Sister's House,
and in Company with <hi>Angelica</hi> and <hi>Leander.</hi> They consulted
together about their return to <hi>Mans,</hi> and resolv'd upon it for
the next Day. Monsieur <hi>de la Garrouffiere</hi> proffer'd them a Coach,
which they would by no means accept of. The Men and
Women-Players Supped with Monsieur <hi>de la Garrouffiere</hi> and his
Company that Night. They afterwards went to Bed betimes,
and next Morning by break of Day <hi>Destiny</hi> and <hi>Leander</hi> took
each of them their Mistrisses behind them, and posted away
to <hi>Mans,</hi> whither <hi>Ragotin, Rancour</hi> and <hi>Olive,</hi> had been gone
before. Monsieur <hi>de la Garrouffiere</hi> proffer'd a great deal of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
to <hi>Destiny,</hi> on account of Madam <hi>Bouvillon,</hi> who had
feign'd herself Sicker than she was, on purpose that she might
not be oblig'd to take leave of that Comedian, whom she for
the present was not at all pleas'd with.</p>

                  <head type="sub">Ragotin's Misfortune.</head>
                  <p>THE two Comedians that return'd to <hi>Mans</hi> with <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotin,</hi>
were led out of their way by that little Rascal, who
would needs treat them at a small Country House of his, which
had been built proportionable to his size. Altho' an exact Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storian
now would think himself oblig'd to tell all the most
important Particulars of this Mans Life, and the Places where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they happen'd, yet shall not I be very certain in what part
of our Hemisphere this little Hovel of <hi>Ragotin's</hi> stood, whither
he was carrying his Brethren that were to be, being not yet
admitted of their Strolling Order. It shall suffice then to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
you, that it was on this side the <hi>Ganges,</hi> and not very
far off from <hi>Sillé le Guillaume.</hi> When he had got thither he
found his House filled with a Company of Gypsies, who in
spite of his Tenant had got into possession thereof, and that
under pretence of their Captains Wife's being ready to lye in,
when their truest reason was that they might have an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
to eat Poultry <hi>gratis,</hi> at a Farm so much out of the
Road. At his first coming <hi>Ragotin</hi> began to be extremely an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry,
as little Men soonest are, and threatn'd the Gypsies with
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:53808:112"/>
the <hi>Provost</hi> of <hi>Mans,</hi> to whom he said he was ally'd by having
married a <hi>Portail.</hi> Then began he to read his Auditors a long
Lecture on the Validity of Relation without being able at the
same time to forbear immoderate Swearing, which he often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termixt
with his Discourse. He threatned them likewise to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
to Provost <hi>la Rappinieres</hi> Lieutenant, whose name alone
was enough to make them tremble. But the <hi>Gypsie</hi>-Captain
raised his Passion beyond all Patience when he began to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement
him, and to tell him, <hi>That if he had before been acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with his Quality, he should never have presum'd to have set Foot
so rashly within his Castle,</hi> so the waggish Varlet called this lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
House, which was only fortified with a wither'd Hedge;
he added moreover, <hi>That his Lady would soon be deliver'd, and
then he would march away his Troop with Bag and Bagage, but first
would satisie his Tenant for the Dammage he and his Men toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with their Horses had done him. Ragotin</hi> was at his Wits
end to find that he could not reasonably pick a quarrel with this
Fellow, and that especially when he plainly perceiv'd himself
abus'd by the many apish Cringes made him: Nevertheless, at
last his Choler was raised by the Flegmatick <hi>Gypsie,</hi> but then
it was just at a time when <hi>Rancour</hi> and the Captains Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
began to recollect being formerly acquainted, and who
consequently embracing, soon soddered up the difference that
was about to have proceeded to <hi>Ragotins</hi> Disadvantage. <hi>Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour</hi>
then earnestly beg'd of his Companion to be quiet, which
he was inclinable to hearken to, and would have proffer'd of
himself had not his natural Pride push'd him on beyond his
Ability. In the mean time the <hi>Gypsie</hi>-Lady was brought to
Bed of a brave Boy; great was the Joy in the little Troop
upon this occasion, and the Captain thereof, as a token of his
being reconciled to <hi>Ragotin,</hi> invited both him and his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
to Supper, having already prepared a <hi>Fricassée</hi> for their
Entertainment. They sat down to Table, and had besides the
<hi>Fricassée</hi> some Partridges and Hares, which the <hi>Gypsies</hi> had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
with their Dogs, two young Turkies, and as many Pigs,
which they had stolen, a <hi>Westphalia-Ham</hi> and several Neats-Tengues,
which they had got by Stratagem; and lastly, they
had a Hare-pye, borrow'd of a Baker, the Crust of which was vora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously
devour'd by five or six young Gypsies that stood at their
Mothers Elbows. Add to all these another <hi>Fricassée</hi> of Pigeons
which <hi>Ragotin</hi> gave them, and you must confess they had Chear
enough. The Guests, besides the Comedians, were to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Nine, all good Dancers, and yet better Thieves. They
began their Healths with that of the King and Princes, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
proceeded to remember those honest Noblemen that
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:53808:112"/>
suffer'd them to harbour within their Jurisdictions. The Captain
propos'd to the Comedians to drink to the Memory of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceas'd
<hi>Charles Dodo,</hi> who was Uncle to the Lying-in-Lady, and
who had been hang'd during the Siege of <hi>Rochel,</hi> by the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery
of one Captian <hi>la Grave.</hi> Every one began to curse that
Captain as a false Brother, and at the same time rail'd hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
at all <hi>Provosts. Ragotin's</hi> Wine in the mean while went
about plentifully, but which had nevertheless this Quality in
it, that it occasion'd no Quarrels among the Guests, who even
to the Manhater <hi>Rancour,</hi> were so extremely pleased with one
another, that they Complimented, and Slobber'd, and Kissed
like so many <hi>Beaux. Ragotin</hi> for his part was resolv'd not to
bring a Scandal on his House by flinching, and therefore suck'd
up his Tipple like to any Spunge. Having drank all Night
one would have thought they should have been sit for Sleep
by Sun-rising; but it so happen'd that the same Wine that
made them so good Friends the Night before, had now inspir'd
them with a Spirit of Separation. They resolv'd to part therefore,
and the Gypsies packing up their Awls, not forgetting to him
something here and there from their Host the Tenant, went one
way, while the <hi>jolly</hi> Landlord mounting his Mule likewise
rod another, and who being now as serious as he was before
transported, took his Journey directly towards <hi>Mans,</hi> not mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the least whether <hi>Rancour</hi> or <hi>Olive</hi> followed him or not,
being wholly taken up with blowing a Pipe of Tobacco
that had been smoak'd out above an Hour before. He had
not been gone above half a League, still sucking his empty
Pipe, which afforded him not one whiff of Smoak, before the
fumes of the Wine began to seize his Crown-Office, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

soon caused him to tumble out of his Saddle. Assoon
as the Master was off, the Mule thought she had nothing to do
but to return from whence she came, and therefore instantly

                     </gap>lept long, snoring however like a crackt Organ-Pipe, before
a naked Man, something resembling the Picture of our first
father, but extremely Hairy, Dirty and Nasty, came up to
him, and began presently to strip off his Cloaths. This wild
Man took more than ordinary pains in drawing off <hi>Ragotin's</hi>
new Boots, which I have told you somewhere before, in this
true History, that his Friend <hi>Rancour</hi> claim'd as his, which one
would have thought might have been sufficient to have awak'd
him, had not he, as the saying is, been dead Drunk; but as he
was, all this Force had no other effect upon him, than to drag
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:53808:113"/>
him bare-Breech'd two or three Rods together, from the place
where he first lay. Being thus unmercifully us'd, a Knife by
chance fell out of the <hi>Sleepers</hi> Pocket, which the wild Fellow
immediately seizing, as if he would have flead the scarce ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
Carcass, sell to ripping up his Cloaths, Shirt, Boots and
Stockings, with whatever else he could not easily get off, and
packing them up upon his Back, fled away with them as swift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as a Wolf would have done with a Lamb. Leave we this
Man to run away with his Spoil, he being the same that had
formerly so terribly frighted <hi>Destiny,</hi> while he was in pursuit
of <hi>Angelica,</hi> and let us return to assist <hi>Ragotin,</hi> who yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
asleep, tho' he ought by all means to be waked. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho'
his naked Body had been for some time exposed to the
scorching Sun, and endured the stinging Assaults of several sorts
of Insects, yet was it not possible to wake him, till some Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sants
came by rattling with a Cart. They no sooner perceiv'd
him but they all cry'd out, <hi>There he is,</hi> and afterwards com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up softly to him, as if they had been unwilling to disturb
him they made sure of his Legs and Arms, and binding them
fast with good strong Cords, they took him up, so hamper'd,
and canted him into their Cart, which they immediatelye drove
away with as much expedition as a Lover would do a Coach
with a stolien Heiress in it. <hi>Ragotin</hi> was as ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Drunk, that neither the violence offer'd him, nor the excessive

as violently as they had done it thither. The discreet Read
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:53808:113"/>
may perhaps have a desire to know what these Fellows would
have had with <hi>Ragotin,</hi> and how they came to do nothing to
him, but which I could not pretend to satisfie them in, had it
not come to my knowledge by Chance. A Priest of the lower
<hi>Mayne,</hi> a little Melancholly-Mad, having been brought up to
<hi>Paris</hi> by a suit at Law, during the time that his Cause was
preparing for a Hearing, would needs spend his time in
Printing some whimsical Fancies of his on the Revelations. He
was so exceeding fertile in <hi>Chimeras,</hi> and always so fond of his
last Productions, that he still blotted out the former; whereby
his Printers were forc'd to Correct the same Sheet at least twenty
times over. This made them so Mad, that for every Sheet he
was oblig'd to look out for a new Printer, till a last he hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd
on the Person that Printed this present <hi>Romance,</hi> wherein
he chanced to light upon some Leaves which mention'd this
same Adventure I have told you. This Priest knew more of
the Story than I who writ it, having it seems been inform'd
from the Peasants own Mouths who had carried away <hi>Rago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin,</hi>
What had been the occasion of their so doing, which I
could not possibly have come to the knowledge of. He saw
at first wherein my Relation was defective, and acquainted
my Printer therewith, who was extremely surpriz'd at the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
thinking with others, that my <hi>Romance</hi> had only been
a fabulous Story of my own Invention. Supposing it might be
of some service to me to put me in the right, my Printer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
him that he would come and give me a Visit, which he
readily consented to. Then did I learn from this faithful <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sean</hi>
that the Peasants who had bound <hi>Ragotin</hi> while a sleep, were
some of the nearest Relations to the poor Mad-man that run a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Country, who had frighted <hi>Destiny</hi> in the Night, and
stript <hi>Ragotin</hi> in the Day-time. They had, it seems, resolv'd
among themselves to coop up their Kinsman whenever they met
him, and had made several attempts upon him for that purpose,
but he still beat them and got from them, being a stout rug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
Fellow. Some Persons of a Neighbouring Village having
espy'd <hi>Ragotin</hi> lying Naked in the Sun, took him for the Mad
fellow lying a sleep, but daring not to come near him for fear
of a beating, they gave notice to the Country Fellows his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
who venturing to seize on him with all the caution
before mention'd, took him without knowing who he was, and
discovering afterwards their Mistake, set his Feet at liberty,
but not his Hands, for fear he might attempt something against
them. These <hi>Memoirs</hi> I had from this Priest pleased me ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely;
and I must own, did me no ordinary Service, but in
return I thought I made him sufficient recompence by advising
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:53808:114"/>
him not to procced any farther in the publishing of his <hi>Ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
Visionary Comment.</hi> Some Readers perhaps will condemn
me for having inserted this needless Circumstance, and others
it may be, at the same time, commend me for my Sincerity.
Return we now to <hi>Ragotin,</hi> his Body all besmear'd and bruis'd,
his Mouth dry and gaping like to the parcht Earth; his Head
heavy and dull, and his Arms pinion'd behind his Back. He
got up as well as he could, and having cast his Eyes round
him as far as he could see, and perceiving neither House nor
Man near him, he beat it on the Hoof, taking to the nearest
Road he could find, and all the way racking his Brains to
find out the cause of his Disaster. Having his Hands tied be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
him he was not a little incommoded by several obstinate
Flies, that chose to fix on those parts of his Body, which by
reason of his being bound, he could not possibly reach, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he sound himself frequently oblig'd to lye all along upon
the Ground, whereby either to rub off or crush the troublelom
Vermine. At last he came to a hollow way, having a thick
Quick-set Hedge on either side, and wherein a little purling
Stream run down to a Neighbouring River. This gave him
occasion to rejoice, hoping now to get clear of his Mud and
Dirt, which hung in great plenty about him. Coming near
the Ford he saw a Coach which had been just then overturn'd
and out of which the Coachman and another Fellow were hawl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
five or six Nuns that had been well drench'd in the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
This piece of Charity he perceiv'd to be perform'd at the
earnest Exhortations of a venerable Prelate, who stood hard by
looking on. Among these Nuns was the old <hi>Abbess</hi> of <hi>Estival,</hi>
who was coming from <hi>Mans,</hi> whither an Affair of Importance
had called her. The <hi>Abbess</hi> and <hi>Nuns</hi> were no sooner drawn
out of the Coach, but they perceiv'd at a distance <hi>Ragotin's</hi>
naked figure marching towards them, whereat they were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
asfrighted, and much more Father <hi>Giflot</hi> the discreet
Director of the Abby. He caus'd the devout Sisters to turn
their Faces hastily about, that they might not desile their Eyes
with so great Impurities, and at the same time calling out
aloud to <hi>Ragotin</hi> commanded him not to approach any nearer
at his peril. <hi>Ragotin</hi> nevertheless kept onwards of his way,
till at last coming to a long Plank that had been laid a'cross
the River for People to walk over, he was met in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
thereof by Father <hi>Giflot,</hi> follow'd by the Coach-man and
Peasant, who all doubted at first whether they were not best
to exorcise him, his shape seeming to them Diabolical. At
length the Father took Courage, and demanded of him <hi>Who he
was? Whence he came? How he came to be Naked?</hi> And lastly,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:53808:114"/>
                     <hi>What made him to have his Hands tied behind him?</hi> All which
Questions he asked with a great deal of Gravity and <hi>Decorum,</hi>
which notwithstanding <hi>Ragotin</hi> answer'd very saucily, requiring
of the Priest, <hi>What he had to do to ask him so many Questions,</hi> and
afterwards pressing to go forwards upon the Plank, he push'd
the reverend Father so rudely, that he tumbled him over Head
and Ears into the Water; the good Priest drew in after him
the Coachman, and he in like manner the Country Man, all
which <hi>Ragotin</hi> perceiving, and being pleased at, immediately
set up a great laughter. He afterwards held his way on to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the <hi>Nuns,</hi> who cover'd their Faces with their Veils, and
would by no means be seen by him. <hi>Ragotin</hi> for his part was
indifferent whether he saw their Faces or not, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
went onward of his way, thinking speedily to get quit of
his Adventure, which nevertheless Father <hi>Gistot</hi> did not intend he
should. He pursued him therefore close with the Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
and Coach-man for his Seconds, which last being natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
the most Cholerick of the three, and besides put out of
Humour by the <hi>Abbesses</hi> Scolding at him, detach'd his Body
from the rest, and coming up to <hi>Ragotin</hi> reveng'd himself
with his Whip on his Hide, for the Water he had bestow'd
on his. <hi>Ragotin</hi> durst not abide a second Charge, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
immediately put himself into a posture to fly. He sled
then like a Dog with a Bottle to his Tail, while the incens'd
Coachman, not satisfied with a lash or two, gave him half a
score more to encrease his speed, leaving at every stroak the
Characters of his Wrath, imprinted in Blood upon his Breech,
<hi>Giflot</hi> tho' almost out of Breath with running so swistly, had
yet still enough left to cry out <hi>Whip him, whip him soundly,</hi> which
animated the Coachman to redouble his Stripes, and poor <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotin</hi>
to encrease his speed, till at last a Mill presented it self
in his way as an <hi>Asylum</hi> to save him. He ran in there with
the Executioner close at his Heels, and finding the Door of
a little Back-yard open, he entred in thereat in great haste, but
which he had no sooner done, than he was caught by the But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocks
by a Mastiff Dog. He thereupon began to shriek out
most dolefully, and flying to an adjoining Garden, with great
precipitation, he happen'd to tumble down five or six Hives of
Bees that stood just at his entrance. This prov'd much the
worst of all his Misfortunes, for these little wing'd Enemies
with their pointed Stings assailing a naked Body that had no
Arms to defend it, tormented and Blister'd him most cruelly.
He hereupon bawl'd out so loud that the Dog that had bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
him was scar'd away for fear. The same cause drove a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the Coachman and Father <hi>Gislot,</hi> which last having given
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:53808:115"/>
his Revenge too great a loose, and kept his Charity too strait
lac'd, began to repent of his Cruelty, and hasten'd immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
to call the Master and his Man to the assistance of the
poor Fellow, who was thus worried in the Garden. The
Miller made no great haste, but nevertheless came at last, when
snatching up <hi>Ragotin</hi> from among his venemous Enemies, tho'
he might be a little displeased at the overthrow of his Hives,
yet had he nevertheless more Charity than the Priest, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
at first sight to pity him. He then proceeded to demand
of him <hi>What the Devil made him to thrust himself while na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
and his Hands tied, among his Stocks of Bees?</hi> But tho'
<hi>Ragotin</hi> was going to answer him, yet could he not, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the excessive Pains he felt all over his Body. A Bears
Cub but newly Whelpt, and never lick'd into form, could not
be so shapeless as our <hi>Ragotin</hi> was in his Humane figure, after
having been stung by these merciless Creatures, being swell'd
excessively, even from Head to Foot. The Millers Wife as
pitious as most good Women are, got a Bed provided for him
and laid him into it. Father <hi>Giflot,</hi> the Coachman and Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant,
return'd back to the Abbess of <hi>Estival,</hi> who with her
<hi>Nuns</hi> being re-embark'd in their Coach, set forwards on their
Journey under Convoy of the reverend Father mounted on a
Mare. It happen'd that the aforesaid Mill belong'd either to
<hi>du Rignon</hi> or his Son-in-Law <hi>Bagottiere</hi> I cannot say whether.
This <hi>du Rignon</hi> it seems was a Relation of <hi>Ragotin's,</hi> which
when the Miller and his Wife came to know, they took more
than ordinary care of him, and caus'd a Surgeon of a Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Town to come and Cure him, which he happily
perform'd in a short time. Assoon as he was well able to
Walk, he return'd to <hi>Mans,</hi> where his Joy for <hi>Rancour</hi> and
<hi>Olive's</hi> having found his Mule and brought it home along
with them, soon made him forget his fall out of the Cart,
the Coachmans lashes, his bitting by the Mastiff, and his
being stung by the Bees.</p>

                  <head type="sub">Some Passages between the little Ragotin and the
great Baguenodiere.</head>
                  <p>DEstiny and <hi>Star, Leander</hi> and <hi>Angelica,</hi> two brace of
noble and real Lovers, arriv'd at the Capital City of
<hi>Maine,</hi> without meeting any the least Misfortune by the way.
<hi>Destiny</hi> soon reinstated <hi>Angelica</hi> in her Mothers Favour, to
whom he had given so plausible an Account and Character of
<hi>Leander's</hi> Amours and Condition, that Mrs. <hi>Cave</hi> began now
to approve the young Man's Passion, as much as she had before
oppos'd it. The poor Company of Strollers had had no great
reason to brag of theri gettings at <hi>Mans</hi> had not a Man of
Quality that lov'd Plays extremely, made them amends for
the losses they had sustain'd by the Citizens. The greatest
part of this Person's Estate lying in <hi>Maine,</hi> he had taken a
House at <hi>Mans,</hi> whither he often invited as well Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers
as Country Gentry, among whom were sometimes
the greatest Wits, and often times Poets of the first rank
to all which he approved himself a kind of Modern <hi>Mecaenas.</hi>
His chiefest delight was in Comedy, and therefore he not only
cherish'd the Composers thereof, but likewise invited every Year
the best Comedians in the Kingdom to come to <hi>Mans.</hi> This
Nobleman happen'd to come thither much about the same
time that these poor <hi>Strollers</hi> were going thence on account of
the thinness of their Audiences, but he desired them by all
means to continue there a Fortnight longer; and the better
to incline them to it, he presented them with a Hundred Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stols,
promising to give them as many more at their departure.
He was glad of this occasion to divert several Persons of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of both Sexes that he had brought along with him to
<hi>Mans,</hi> and who were to make some short stay there at his
Request. This Lord, whom I will call here the Marquess
<hi>d'Orse,</hi> was a great Hunter and had brought all his Hunting
Equipage to <hi>Mans,</hi> which in every respect was the finest to
be met with in <hi>France.</hi> The Downes and Forests of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
of <hi>Maine</hi> made it to be one of the best places for those
Sports in the whole Kingdom, and that either for Deer or Hares,
and it being now the Season for such like Divertisements the
City of <hi>Mans</hi> was full of Huntsmen, which the approaching
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:53808:116"/>
Festival had drawn thither, most of them with their Wives,
who were extremely ravish'd at the sight of the Court Gallantry,
thinking they should now have matter sufficient to furnish them
with Chat for the longest Winters Evening. It is not the least
ambition of the Country People to be able to relate some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
and brag, that at such a time, and in such and such a
place, they have seen such and such Courtiers, whom they
salute only with their Sir-names, and mention without any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of Title; for Example, one will tell you he lost his
Money to <hi>Roquelaure, Crequi</hi> won so much, <hi>Coaquin</hi> hunted a
Stag in <hi>Touraine,</hi> and the like. But if you suffer them to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
either upon Politicks or War, they will never cease talking
till they have drain'd the Subject as dry as they were at first
empty. But let us here put an end to out Digression. <hi>Mans</hi>
was then filled with Nobility and Gentry of all sorts. The
Inns were crowded with Guests, and the greatest part of the
principal Citizens who lodged such Courtiers or Country Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
as were of their Friends, had in a short time their best
Linnen foul'd, and their Family Provisions exhausted. The
Strollers quickly open'd their Shop, resolving to let their Cus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomers
have lumping Penny-worths, since they had been so
well paid before-hand. The Citizens of both Sexes prepar'd
for the Diversion, and the Town and Country-Ladies were
over-joy'd to behold every Day the Court-Madams, from whom
they learn'd to dress <hi>alamode,</hi> or at least better than they were
wont to do, which tho' it occasion'd expence to their Husbands,
yet was it of exceeding benefit to their Taylors, who by these
means had many an old Gown to alter. They had a <hi>Ball</hi> every
Night, where several wretched Dancers mov'd awkwardly in
Courants, and many young Citizens trip'd it about in Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
Drawers, and wax'd Slippers. Madam <hi>Star</hi> and Madam
<hi>Angelica</hi> fired the Hearts of most of the young Men that saw
them, and raised Envy in the greatest part of the Women.
<hi>Iuezilla</hi> who danced a <hi>Saraband</hi> at the request of the Players,
was admir'd, and <hi>Roquebrune</hi> was just ready to die with Love
at the sight of it. <hi>Ragotin</hi> likewise confess'd to <hi>Rancour,</hi> that
if he did not quickly bring him into Favour with <hi>Star, France</hi>
would soon have reason to lament the loss of him. <hi>Rancour</hi>
presently gave him hopes, and as a more particular Testimony
of his Friendship than ordinary, desired of him to lend him
twenty or thirty <hi>Francs. Ragotin</hi> turn'd pale at this surprizing
request, and not only repented of but was also ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
his Love. However, at length that domineering Passion
prevailing in him, he made up the Sum demanded, of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
kinds of Money, and out of several Pockets, and gave
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:53808:116"/>
them with a sorrowful Countenance to <hi>Rancour,</hi> who engag'd
at the same time, that in less than twenty four Hours he should
be sure to hear himself talk'd of. That Day was Acted <hi>Sir
Noisy Parrot,</hi> a Play as merry as he that writ it had cause
to be sad. The Audience was numerous; the Comedy indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently
well Play'd, and every body was well enough pleas'd
execpt the unfortunate <hi>Ragotin.</hi> He through some occasion or
other came to the House late, and therefore must crowd in where
he could get a seat. His ill Fortune had placed him just be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
a Country Gentleman of the largest size, who had a
great loose Coat on, which not a little encreased his bulk.
Besides his spreading Haunches, Chine and Shoulders, he was
of a Stature so much taller than other Men, that altho' he
sat down, <hi>Ragotin</hi> who was but one row off him, thought he
stood a tip-toe, and therefore cry'd out incessantly to him <hi>to
sit down like the rest,</hi> not believing that one who sat on the same
Bench could be so much taller than any of his Companions.
The Gentleman whose name was <hi>la Baguenodiere,</hi> knew not
for some time that <hi>Ragotin</hi> had spoke to him, till at length
being called by the title of the Gentleman with the Green
Feather, whereof indeed he had a very flaunting one in his
Hat, but that none of the cleanest nor finest, he turned his
Head about and saw the little <hi>Impertinent,</hi> who thereupon bid
him somewhat roughly to <hi>sit down.</hi> This, nevertheless <hi>la Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guenodiere</hi>
was so little moved at, that he turned his Face again
very gravely towards the Stage, as if nothing had been said
to him; hereat <hi>Ragotin</hi> began to call to him again to <hi>sit down,</hi>
but which he took as little notice of as before, only turning
about and looking upon him, and then returning to his former
posture. This at last so vex'd <hi>Ragotin</hi> that he bawled out to him
again a third time, which notwithstanding <hi>la Baguenodiere</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded
as little as formerly. During all the time the Play
lasted <hi>Ragotin</hi> still treated him after the like manner in great
Fury, and <hi>la Baguenodiere</hi> as often look'd upon him with the
same unconcern, without speaking a Word to him, which was
sufficient to have enflam'd the most Phlegmatick Man in the
World. One might have compar'd <hi>la Baguenodiere</hi> in this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
to a large Mastiff, and <hi>Ragotin</hi> to a little Cur that runs
barking at him by his side, which provokes the great Dog so
little, that in contempt of him he only steps aside, and lifting
up his Leg, pisses against the Wall. At lenght the whole Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
began to take notice of what had passed between the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest
and the least Man among them, and every one presum'd
to smile at it, just at the time that <hi>Ragotin</hi> began to Swear
and rave through Impatience, while <hi>la Baguenodiere</hi> returned
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:53808:117"/>
him only a cold and indifferent Glance. This <hi>Baguenodiere</hi>
was at the same time the largest Man and the greatest Brute
in the World, I should have said Clown. He demanded with
his accustom'd Gravity of the two Gentlemen that sat next to
him <hi>what they laughed at,</hi> to which they instantly reply'd very
ingenuously, <hi>that it was at him and</hi> Ragotin, whereby it seems they
thought rather to have tickled than displeas'd him. However it so
happen'd that it disgusted him, and made him to reply in a great
rage, <hi>Then you are a couple of Sots,</hi> which Affront he cast in their
Teeth with so great Indignation, and such a sower look, that they
presently perceiv'd he was <hi>piqu'd,</hi> and therefore thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
obliged in requital for his Compliment to give him, each of
them, a good sound Box o'th Ear. <hi>La Baguenodiere</hi> hereupon
having his Arms hamper'd in his Coat, could do nothing to them
again at first but hunch them to and fro with his Elbows,
which the two Gentlemen that were Brothers, and naturally
very brisk, taking the advantage of, before he could well
disengage himself, gave him half a dozen more swinging
cuffs on the Chaps, which they happen'd to deliver with such
an equal Measure of Time, that those who heard the sound
without seeing the Blows given, thought verily they had been
so many singly Claps. At last <hi>Baguenodiere</hi> got his Arms free
from under his cumbersom Coat, but being so close press'd
by the two active Brothers, who box'd him most unmercifully
all the while, he had not room to move those carnal Weapons
of his in. He found himself therefore oblig'd to retreat, which
going to do forwards. Pardon the Incongruity of the Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
his Enemies having secured him behind and on either
side, he chanc'd to fall on a Man below him, and by the
weight of his Body, tumbled both him and his Seat down
upon the unfortunate <hi>Ragotin,</hi> who I should have told you,
not finding himself able to prevail with the Country Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
to let him see over him, had got a seat a little under
him, who was thereby forced down upon another, that beat him
backwards upon another, and so onwards to the last Man or
Woman, no matter which, that sat below, whereby all these
Tumblers in this condition look'd just like so many Ninepins
that had been dextrously tip'd by a skilful touch of one. The noise
of the Persons tumbling, the crush'd Legs, the frighted Maids,
the crying Children, the babling Women, and in a Word, of
those that laughed, of others that lamented, and lastly of such
as either clap'd their Hands or hissed, made such a confuss'd
din, as one would have thought could have happen'd no where
but at the Valley of <hi>Iehosaphat.</hi> Never did such a trifling
cause occasion so many great Accidents before; but that in
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:53808:117"/>
my opinion, which was the most wonderful, was that there
happen'd not to be one Sword drawn, tho' the Scuffle
first began among those that wore them, and whereof there
were above a Hundred in the Company. I was equally sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd
at <hi>Baguenodieres</hi> stupidness, who could Cuff and be
Cuffed, and receive Assaults and make them, as if he had been
about the most indifferent thing in Nature. It was farther
observed as another instance of his dulness or sullenness, call
it which you please, that he had not once opened his Mouth
all that Afternoon, except when he uttered those unmannerly
Words, which brought such a shower of Cuffs about his Ears:
neither did he afterwards speak one more all that Night, so
well was this huge Mans Flegm and Taciturnity proportion'd
to his bulk. This grand Confusion of Seats and Persons hud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled
together, was no small time putting in order, which
while some were busy about, and others charitably interposing
between the three Combatants, who by this time were got
to Fisticuffs again, a sudden howling was heard as proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from underground. Who could this now be but <hi>Ragotin?</hi>
For Fortune when she has once begun to persecute any poor
Wretch, seldom leaves tormenting him till she has undone him. It
seems the Seat which this little Imp sat upon was plac'd on a
Plank that lay over a Drain belonging to the Tennis-Court, which
drain is commonly in the middle, just under the Line. It was
an ordinary receptacle for the Rain-Water, or any filth
that was swept away, and this Plank served as a lid to cover
it. But as time consumes all things, so had it rotted this to
that degree that <hi>Ragotin's</hi> weight being greatly encreased by
those that fell upon him, in the late hurly-burly, it presently
gave way under him, and he immediately falling in had the
Misfortune to have another Man of a considerable bulk fall
upon him, whose Leg, which by the way, was both Booted
and Spur'd, slipping into the hole where <hi>Ragotins</hi> whole Body
lay, the Spur so pricked this poor Creatures Throat that it
oblig'd him to howl after a most frightful manner. A Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-by
observing the Accident, and giving the Man his Hand
to lift him out, <hi>Ragotin</hi> perceiving the Foot leaving him, gave
it so terrible a nip with his Teeth, even through the Boot,
that the Man letting go his hold dropt down again, thinking
verily he had been bit by a Serpent. He likewise gave so
frightful a shriek at the same time, that the Fellow who was
helping him out run away for fear. The same Person reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
himself soon after, lent him his Hand again, and then
at one lusty pull he brought both him and <hi>Ragotin</hi> out at
once, who it seems had the wit to hold by the Mans Coat.
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:53808:118"/>
The little Man no sooner saw the light again, than he begun
to threaten every body with his Nods and Looks, but more
especially those whom he observed to laugh at him. He af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
thrust himself among the Crowd that were now going
out, meditating all along upon something that should prove
as honourable for him to perform, as fatal to his Adversary
<hi>Baguenodiere.</hi> I never came to know whether this last Person
and the two Brothers ever accomodated their difference or not,
however they happen'd to fall out, but this I heard, that they
never afterwards Assaulted each other. This was what di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbed
the first Play that our Comedians acted before the
illustrious Company then assembled at <hi>Mans.</hi>

                  <p>NEXT was represented <hi>Nicomedes,</hi> a Play written by the
incomparable Monsieur <hi>de Corneille.</hi> This Comedy is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
in my Judgment, being the only one of his that has
most of its Authors own in it. In it he has sufficiently dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play'd
the richness of his <hi>Genius,</hi> and given all its Persons
bold and shining Characters, but that quite different from
each other. While this was playing there happen'd to be no
disturbance, and which it may be, fell out by reason that <hi>Ragotin</hi>
was absent. Scarce a Day passed wherein he did not meet
with some broil or other, to which his peevish Pride and rash
Presumption exposed him as much as his ill Fortune, which
scarce till now had given him the least respit. The little Man
had spent his Afternoon with <hi>Inezilla's</hi> Husband, the Operator
<hi>Ferdinando,</hi> a <hi>Norman</hi> by Birth, but who called himself a <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian,</hi>
and who, as I have already told you, profest Chymistry,
tho' to speak freely of him, he was a great Quack, or rather
a great Cheat. <hi>Rancour</hi> to rid himself of the tedious Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities
of <hi>Ragotin,</hi> to whom he stood engag'd to make Madam
<hi>Star</hi> love him, had it seems enclin'd this little Fellow to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that this Operator was a great Magician, and could by
his Art force the wisest Woman in the World to run after a
Man in her Smock if he so pleased, but that he did not care
to practise much that way, except for a particular Friend,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:53808:118"/>
whose discretion he was well satisfied in, by reason he had
formerly undergone some trouble by being overperswaded by
some great Lords at Court. He counsel'd <hi>Ragotin</hi> therefore
to do his utmost to gain his Friendship, which he nevertheless
told him was no easy matter to do, the Operator being a Man
of Parts, and would consequently esteem only such as were so
likewise, but then where he once took a fancy to a Man he
kept nothing a secret from him. One need only to praise or
commend a proud Fellow to get what one will out of him when
it is quite otherwise with the Meek and Humble, for they are
not so easily imposed upon. <hi>Rancour</hi> then perswaded <hi>Ragotin</hi>
to what he pleased, and he went immediately and perswaded
the <hi>Operator</hi> that he was a great Magician. I shall not need to
repeat all he said to him; it suffices that the <hi>Operator</hi> being prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by <hi>Rancour</hi> before hand for that purpose, acted his part so
well, that he denied his Profession, only that his Bubble might be
the more enclinable to believe it. <hi>Ragotin</hi> then, as I have
said before, staid the whole Afternoon with him; but by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
the Operator had then a Chymical Preparation in Hand, he
would by no means satisfie him in any thing that Day, and
which occasioned our impertinent <hi>Mansean</hi> to have but an ill
Night of it after he went from him. Next Morning betimes
he got to the Operators Chamber before he was up, which <hi>Ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zilla</hi>
took very ill, she not being then so youthful as to come
out of her Bed as fresh as a Rose, and for that reason always
required some Hours in private, before she could be ready for
a publick View. She therefore immediately slip'd into her Clos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set,
her she Black-moor soon following her with Loves Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition,
and left her Husband and <hi>Ragotin</hi> to discourse the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
at Liberty. <hi>Ferdinando</hi> then began to open his Magazine
of Miracles and Performances, but would nevertheless Promise
to perform nothing for him, <hi>Ragotin</hi> would therefore needs
encline him to it by Demonstrations of his Bounty, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
invited both him and his Wife to Dinner. The Men
and Women-Players were invited likewise, I shall not give
you any particulars of their Entertainment, I would only have
you to take notice that they were very Merry and fed hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
After Dinner <hi>Inezilla</hi> was desired by <hi>Destiny</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Comedians to read some little <hi>Spanish</hi> Novel or other to
them, which she had either Composed herself, or Translated
by help of the divine <hi>Roquebrune,</hi> who had sworn by <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollo</hi>
and the Nine <hi>Muses,</hi> that in six Months time he would
teach her all the Graces and Perfections of the <hi>French</hi>
Tongue. <hi>Inezilla</hi> was so obliging that she did not require
much entreaty, and therefore while <hi>Ragotin</hi> was taken up
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:53808:119"/>
in consulting the Magician <hi>Ferdinando,</hi> she Read the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lovving

                     <hi>DOrethea</hi> and <hi>Feliciana de Monsalva</hi> were two the most aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Ladies in all <hi>Seville,</hi> but tho' they had not been
such, their Fortunes and Quality were so very considerable,
that those alone had been sufficient to have engag'd any Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
to Court them, that had Inclinations to be well Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried.
<hi>Don Manuel</hi> their Father had not yet declar'd himself in
favour of any Person, and <hi>Dorethea,</hi> who as his eldest Daughter
ought to have been first <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, had like her Sister so well ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nag'd
her Looks and Actions, that the most confident pretenders to
her had yet reason sufficient to doubt whether their Addresses
would be well or ill received. However these fair Sisters never
went to Mass without a great crowd of Lovers after them, exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Sparkishly trick'd up, and they never came near the <hi>Holy-Water</hi>
but there were Hands of all sorts and sizes ready to dip
with them, out of a peculiar kind of Devotion. Whenever
they happen'd but to lift off their Eyes from their Prayer-Books,
they immediately became the Center of I know not
how many wishful Glances; and they could not make the least
step in the Church but they had presently abundance of Curt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies
to return to the great number of <hi>Beaux</hi> that bow'd to
them on all sides. But however troublesom where the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilities
paid to them in Publick, the frequent Serenades under
their Windows made them considerable amends, and rendred
that restraint supportable, which they were oblig'd to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go
by the Custom of their Country. Hardly a Night. passed
but they were regal'd with some Musick or other, and often
in the Day time there was running at the Ring, and Tilting just
under their Windows, which look'd towards the Market-place,
most proper for those Exercises. One Day among the rest, a
Stranger begot the admiration of the Spectators by his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
Address, beyond the ability of any of the Gentry of
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:53808:119"/>
the City, who was likewise observ'd by the two Sisters to be a
very compleat <hi>Cavalier.</hi> Divers Persons of <hi>Seville,</hi> who had
been formerly his Acquaintance in <hi>Flanders,</hi> where he command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a Regiment of Horse, invited him to run at the Ring with
them, which he accoringly perform'd in a Soldiers Habit. Some
Days after, there happen'd the Consecration of a Bishop at <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville.</hi>
The Stranger, who went by the name of <hi>Don Sancho de
Sylva,</hi> would needs be at the Ceremony, and consequently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
in the Church, together with the greatest Gallants of
the City. The fair Sisters came thither likewise, with many
other Ladies disguiz'd, after the mode of the Place, with Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles
of thick Stuff, and Hats with Plumes of Feathers in them.
<hi>Don Sancho</hi> by chance had plac'd himself between the two Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
and another Lady whom he accosted; but she desiring him
civilly to desist, and leave a place next her for a Friend she ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,
he obey'd her, and turned towards <hi>Dorothea de Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salva,</hi>
who sat nearer to him than her Sister, and who had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
all that passed betwixt him and the Lady. <q>I was in
hopes Madam, quoth he, addressing himself to <hi>Dorothea,</hi> that
the Lady here, to whom I have just made my Applications,
would not have refused me her Conversation, upon the account
of my being a Stranger, but she has justly rewarded my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption
in thinking I had any thing tolerable to offer.
I nevertheless beseech you, Madam, continued he, to shew
more Pity and Generosity to a Gentleman who has a mind to
experience the Bounty of the Ladies of <hi>Seville.</hi>
                     </q> 
                     <hi>You give me
a much greater cause to treat you ill than you have done this La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi>
reply'd <hi>Dorothea, since you offer me only what she had before
refus'd; but that you may have no real reason to complain of our
Ladies of this Country, I consent to converse with you as long as this
Ceremony lasts, to convince you that I have no Assignation to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend.</hi>
                     <q>That is what does not a little surprize me, reply'd
<hi>Don Sancho,</hi> being so wonderfully beauteous as you are, and
which makes me enclinable to believe, that either you are
very formidable, the Gallants of this Town very faint-Heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
or else, that the Person, whose place I now usurp, is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.</q>
                     <hi>And do you believe then Sir,</hi> quoth <hi>Dorothea, that I am so
little skill'd in the Art of Love, that I could not refrain from ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
in publick without my Gallant if I had any? For the future
you would do well not to entertain such unbecoming Opinions of those
you are wholly unacquainted with.</hi> 
                     <q>You may be convinc'd, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
reply'd <hi>Don Sancho,</hi> that I have a better Opinion of you
than you imagine, if you would but allow me to adore you
suitable to my Inclinations.</q> 
                     <hi>Our first Motions are always fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacious,</hi>
answered <hi>Dorothea, and besides there are no small difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:53808:120"/>
to be encountered in the performing of what you propound.</hi> 
                     <q>There
are none so great, reply'd <hi>Don Sancho,</hi> but I would endeavour
to surmount them all, to gain the Honour of your Esteem.</q>
                     <hi>That is not the work of a few Days,</hi> Repartee'd <hi>Dorothea; you don't
consider perhaps, Sir, that you do but travel through</hi> Seville, <hi>and it
may be, are ignorant that I should not well like to be belov'd only</hi>
en passant. <q>But grant me, Madam, what I humbly request,
reply'd <hi>Don Sancho,</hi> and I will be bound to continue in <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville</hi>
as long as I live.</q> 
                     <hi>Now you speak like your self,</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
<hi>Dorothea, and I cannot but wonder,</hi> continu'd she, <hi>that a
Person that was able to say so many fine things, should not before
this have provided himself of a Mistriss to exhaust his Gallantry
upon. Is it,</hi> added she, <hi>that he never yet thought any of them
worth his trouble?</hi> It is rather, reply'd <hi>Don Sancho,</hi> our of a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trust
he has of his Abilities. <hi>Answer me precisely, Sir,</hi> continu'd
<hi>Dorothea, to what I shall now demand of you, which is this? Which
among all your Ladies it is, that would be soonest able to keep you
in</hi> Seville <hi>were it her request?</hi> 
                     <q>I have told you already Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
reply'd <hi>Don Sancho,</hi> that you might if you so pleased
the soonest of any.</q> 
                     <hi>You never saw me before, Sir,</hi> quoth <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vothea,
therefore pray let some other happy Lady be the Person.</hi> 
                     <q>I
must acknowledge then, answer'd <hi>Don Sancho,</hi> since you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
it of me, that had <hi>Dorothea de Montsalva,</hi> as great a
stock of Wit as I have discover'd in you, I should think that
Man happy whose Merit and Services she could Smile upon.</q>
                     <hi>There are many Ladies in</hi> Seville, reply'd <hi>Dorothea, that not only
equal but excel her. But,</hi> added she, <hi>Have you ever yet heard
that among all the crowd of her Admirers she ever favour'd one more
than another?</hi> 
                     <q>As I found my self very far from deserving her
Favour, answer'd <hi>Don Sancho,</hi> I never troubled my self to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
into the good Fortune of others.</q> 
                     <hi>Why should you not think
your self as deserving as another?</hi> demanded <hi>Dorothea, Womens
Humours are for the most part unaccountable,</hi> added she, <hi>and it
often happens that the first Assault of a Stranger has better suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
with them than the continued Siege of a constant Votary.</hi>
                     <q>You have got a very pretty way to get rid of me, quoth
<hi>Don Sancho,</hi> for I plainly perceive by your Discourse that
the Services of a new comer would not at all be accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to you, in the prejudice of some more happy Person you
have long been engag'd to.</q> 
                     <hi>Don't let that enter into your
Head,</hi> reply'd <hi>Dorothea, but believe rather that I am not so easie
as to be cajolled with the bare pretence of a Passion from one that
never saw me in his Life.</hi> 
                     <q>If that be only wanting, Madam,
to compleat my Happiness, reply'd <hi>Don Sancho,</hi> conceal your
self no longer from a Stranger that has been already so charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:53808:120"/>
with your Wit.</q> 
                     <hi>You would not be so much with my Face,</hi>
answer'd <hi>Dorothea, if you saw it.</hi> 
                     <q>Ah! you cannot chuse but
be most lovely, reply'd <hi>Don Sancho,</hi> since you so freely Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
that you are not so, nay now I have greater cause than
ever, to believe that you are weary of my Company, since
either that I seem troublesom, or because every corner of
your Heart has been already taken up by others. It were
unjust therefore, continued he, that your goodness should be
any longer trespassed upon by my Boldness, and which I
had discontinu'd before, had not I had a mind to convince
you that I had more honourable Designs, when I made you
the faithful tenders of my Life and Freedom, than to make
you my Pastime and Diversion.</q> 
                     <hi>And to shew you,</hi> reply'd
<hi>Dorothea, that I do not think that time lost which I have spent
in hearing you, I will be contented to continue with you so much lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
as may suffice to let me know who you are.</hi> 
                     <q>It cannot be
my Crime then to satisfie you, answer'd <hi>Don Sancho,</hi> and
therefore I shall proceed to do it. Know then most aimable
and unknown Lady, added he, that my name is <hi>Sylva,</hi> which
I had from my Mother; that my Father is Governour of
<hi>Quitto</hi> in <hi>Peru;</hi> that I am Travelling this way by his Orders;
and that I have before spent some part of my Life in <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi>
where I have by Services attained to the chiefest Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
in the Army; and lastly, had confirm'd upon me a
Commandery of the Order of St. <hi>Iago.</hi> This in few Words,
continued he, is a faithful account of what I am, but what
I would be all my Life long rests only in your Power to
give me leave to express in a place less publick than this.</q>
                     <hi>That shall be assoon as possibly,</hi> reply'd <hi>Dorothea, But in the mean
time to prevent your Desires of knowing more of me at present, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
you mean to run the hazard of not knowing me at all, know
that I am of Quality, and that my Face not so homely as to
frighten you.</hi> This said, <hi>Don Sancho</hi> took his leave with a most
profound Bow, and went up to a Company of Gentlemen that
were then discoursing together in a knot. Some sullen Ladies
now, who are ever censuring others Conducts and Magnifying
their own; who take upon themselves the Arbitration of what
is good or ill, tho one might lay odds in a Wager on their
Virtues, as not easy to be made appear, and who fancy that
for a little brutish Coyness, and pretended religious Squeamish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
they have a title to Supererogation in point of Honour,

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> the wantonness of their past Youth hath left mor Scandal
than ever their crabbed Wrinkles will be able to give good
Examples. These Mumping <hi>Madams,</hi> I say so short sighted
is to their own Faults, will perhaps be apt to affirm that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:53808:121"/>
                     <hi>Dorothea</hi> had too Indiscreetly manag'd herself in the
late Rencounter, and that not only in receiving Addresses so
kindly from a Person she never saw before, but likewise in
suffering him to make Love to her at all; and farther, that if
any young Lady whom they had the Government of should
have done as much, she should not have long continued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
Ground. But let these Novice-Ladies learn from me,
that every Country has its peculiar Customs and Manners, and
that tho' in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> where the Women and Maids
walk about at Liberty, they are or ought to be offended at the
least declaration of Love made them by a stranger; yet in <hi>Spain</hi>
it is quite otherwise, for there the Women being all Cloyster'd
up like <hi>Nuns,</hi> are glad of every occasion of Loves being ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
them, altho' it were from one that had not the least
thing worthy of them in him. Nay, the Women there go
farther, for they commonly make the first Overtures, and are
first taken, by reason that they are last to be seen, having on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
an opportunity to see the Men through their Veils, and that
only at Church, in the Walks, from their Balconies, or through
their Grates. <hi>Dorothea</hi> made her Sister <hi>Feliciana</hi> acquainted
with the Conversation she had with <hi>Don Sancho,</hi> and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
frankly owned to her as her <hi>Confidente,</hi> that she thought
him the most agreeable <hi>Cavalier</hi> in all <hi>Seville.</hi> Her Sister
very much approved of her Design upon his Liberty. The
two fair Ladies entertained each other for some time on the
Advantages and Privileges that Men had above Women. They
urged that Women were never to be married but at the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of their Parents, which did not always suit with their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations,
when Men were at Liberty to pick and chuse
where they pleased, and marry when they pleased. <q>As for
my part, said <hi>Dorothea</hi> to her Sister, Love shall never make me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

all those good Qualities, which are only to be found dispers'd
among divers others; and, added she farther, I would rather

not like.</q> 
                     <hi>Feliciana</hi> told her that was her Resolution too, and

Relation of theirs, and more than that, an intimate Friend,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:53808:121"/>
all Relations are not so, who she was certain would serve her
faithfully in any Affair that concern'd her Happiness so much

was contriving this Intrigue by the help of her Sister, and
instructing her Kinswoman and <hi>Mariana</hi> in what they had to
do, <hi>Don Sancho's</hi> Thoughts were wholly taken up about his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
Lady. He could not satisfie himself whether she had
made those Promises of farther Discovery to abuse him or not,
or whether he did not see her every Day tho' Disguiz'd, either
at Church, in her Window, or else where receiving the Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of her Gallants. Whilst he was thus in doubt, and one
Morning dressing himself in order to look after her, a Veil'd
Lady came to the Door to ask for him. Being admitted, she
delivered him the following <hi>Billet.</hi>

                     <pb n="246" facs="tcp:53808:122"/>You may better imagine, than I express, the Joy that <hi>Don
Sancho</hi> conceiv'd at this News. He embrac'd the Ambassadress
with all possible acknowledgments, and moreover presented her
with a Gold Chain, which she after a modest refusal ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted.
She appointed him a remote place to meet her in
without Attendants in the Evening, and so departed, leaving
him the best satisfied, tho' at the same time the most impatient
Man in the World. At length Night came, and she fail'd not
to be at the place of Assignation richly Habited and Perfum'd.
He was conducted by her first into an ill-favour'd little House,
and afterwards into a very fair Apartment, where he found
three Ladies veil'd. He presently distinguish'd his unknown
Mistriss from the rest by her Shape and Stature, and therefore
immediately Addressed himself to her, entreating her to pull
of her Veil. She made no great difficulty to comply with his
Request, and therefore both she and her Sister forthwith dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd
themselves to the happy <hi>Don Sancho,</hi> to be the two
Beautiful Ladies <hi>Dorothea</hi> and <hi>Feliciana de Montsalva.</hi> 
                     <q>You
may now perceive I told you true, said <hi>Dorothea</hi> to him
throwing off her Veil, when I assur'd you that a Stranget
might sometimes obtain more kindness from us Women in
a Minute, than the most importunate of our Lovers could do by
many Years Courtship. And, continu'd she, you would be
the most ungrateful Person of your Sex, did you either not
highly esteem the Favour I have done you, or mis-interpret
it to my disadvantage.</q> 
                     <hi>I shall ever value what I receive from
you,</hi> reply'd <hi>Don Sancho</hi> Passionately, <hi>as if it came from Hea,
ven, and you may be able to guess by the Care I shall take to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
to my self the Favour you have done me, that if I ever
am so unhappy as to let it be known, it will rather be the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of my Misfortune than Crime.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <l>They said, in short, without controul,</l>
                  <l>All what such Lovers use to say,</l>
                  <l>When Love is Master of the Soul.</l>
                  <p>The Mistriss of the House and <hi>Feliciana,</hi> who had been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Instructed what they had to do, were retir'd to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
distance from the two Lovers, whereby they gave them
an opportunity to exchange their mutual Affections with greater
Ardency than they had time to do at their first meeting, as
likewise to appoint another Assignation to enflame them yet
more if possible. <hi>Dorothea</hi> promised <hi>Don Sancho</hi> to give him
as many Meetings as she could conveniently, for which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
her all the acknowledgments he was capable of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:53808:122"/>
The two other Ladies entertain'd each other apart for
some time; but at length <hi>Mariana</hi>
thought her self oblig'd to
acquaint the Lovers that it was time to separate, at which
<hi>Dorothea</hi> was presently concern'd, and <hi>Don Sancho</hi> visibly chang'd
Countenance; but however part they must. The gallant <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier</hi>
wrote the next Day to his fair Mistriss, and had an
Answer suitable to his Wishes; but I cannot pretend to give
you a sight of their Letters, by reason that none of them ever
came to my Hands. What I can satisfie you in is, that they
met often in the same place, and after the same manner, and
at length arrived to that fervency of Affection, that without
Murdering themselves like <hi>Pyramus</hi> and <hi>Thysbe,</hi> they might well
be said to be as passionate Lovers. It is a common saying, <hi>That
Love, Fire and Money, cannot lie conceal'd. Dorothea,</hi> who had
the gallant Stranger continually in her Mind, could not
forbear talking of him frequently, taking all occasions to set
him so much above all other Gentlemen of <hi>Seville,</hi> that at last
some Ladies who had conceal'd Affections as well as she, and
who observ'd her continually crying up <hi>Don Sancho,</hi> not only
took notice of, but were <hi>piqu'd</hi> at it. Her Sister <hi>Feliciana</hi> had
often advis'd her to be more cautious, and above a Hundred
times in Company, when she was even transported in his
Praise would often tread upon her Toes, till she had almost
crippled her, to desist. At last through her Indiscretion, her
Intrigue came to one of her Admirers knowledge, by means
of a Lady a Friend of his. He had reason enough to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
her in Love with <hi>Don Sancho,</hi> since from the time that
Stranger first appeared in the City neither he nor any of her other
Humble Servants could obtain the least favourable look from
her. This Rival of <hi>Don Sancho's</hi> was Rich, of a good Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
and very well received by <hi>Don Manuel,</hi> who neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
had not yet pressed his Daughter to Marry him, because
as often as he had talked any thing to her tending that way,
she had always conjur'd him not to Marry her so young.
This Gentleman, I begin to recollect his Name was <hi>Don
Diego,</hi> had a mind to be fully assur'd of what he had yet
but suspected. He had one of those <hi>Valets de Chambre</hi> which
we call <hi>Spruce Fellows,</hi> who wear as good Linnen as their
Masters, and sometimes that of their Masters, and who bring
up Fashions among the inferiour Servants, and are as much
or rather more envy'd by the Waiting-Women than belov'd.
This Fellows name was <hi>Gusman,</hi> who having a small tincture
of Poetry compos'd those sorts of Sonnets as <hi>Madrid,</hi> which
<hi>London</hi> and <hi>Paris</hi> we call <hi>Ballads.</hi> He was accustom'd to
Sing them to his Guittar, but that never plain and down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:53808:123"/>
but always attended with the ridiculous Gestures of his
Head and Body. He moreover danc'd the <hi>Sarabande,</hi> was
never without <hi>Castagnets,</hi> would more than once have got to
be a Player, had he not been as often refused; and to make
up the Composition of his Character, was something inclin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the Bully; but to tell you the truth, 'twas that of
the most sneaking kind. All these noble Talents, added to a
little Eloquence his Memory had furnish'd him with, from
his Master's Table-talk, made him to be the Idol, if I may
so speak, of all those Servant Maids that had best Opinions
of themselves. <hi>Don Diego</hi> commanded him to cast an Ogle
or two upon <hi>Isabella,</hi> a young Wench that waited on the
two Ladies <hi>Dorothea</hi> and <hi>Feliciana de Montsalva.</hi> He forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
obey'd his Master's Commands, and <hi>Isabella</hi> was almost
assoon caught in the Trap as it was set for her, believing her
self not a little happy to be belov'd by <hi>Gusman,</hi> whom she
in a short time lov'd again, as he in a little while after did
her really, tho' his first Intentions were only to impose on
her by his Master's Orders, and for his ends. As the Love of
<hi>Gusman</hi> was a thing much coveted amongst the Servant Maids
of that City, so was <hi>Isabella's</hi> Fortune as great as the most am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious
<hi>Valet de Chambre</hi> could expect to be raised to. She
was very well beloved by her Mistrisses, from whom she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
many Favours, and was besides in expectation of a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
to be given her by her Father an honest Tradesman, <hi>Gus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
then thinking seriously on the matter, resolv'd to be her
Husband, as she on her part did to be his Wife, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
having only taken one anothers Words, they lived toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as such. <hi>Isabella</hi> was not a little displeased to observe than
<hi>Mariana</hi> the Surgeons Wife, at whose House <hi>Dorothea</hi> and <hi>Do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Sancho</hi> had their private Meetings, still continued to be their
<hi>Confidente</hi> in a Business, whence she knew must come a great
deal of Profit to her. She had found out the Gold Chain
which <hi>Sancho</hi> had given her, and besides, discover'd many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Presents he had made her, and moreover imagin'd that then
might have been several more which she knew nothing of<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>
This caused her to hate <hi>Mariana</hi> to Death, and which incline<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

of as much as she knew of the Intrigue between the two
Lovers, and concluded all with railing at <hi>Mariana</hi> for depr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

her of her Vails, which she said, was due to her as
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:53808:123"/>
Servant of the House. <hi>Gusman</hi> desired of her farther to let
him know the Day and Hour when the Lovers were next to
meet, which she soon after did, and he consequently acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his Master with not only that, but likewise with all the
rest that he had learned from the treacherous <hi>Isabella. Don
Diego</hi> hereupon habited himself like a Beggar, and taking his
Post just at <hi>Mariana's</hi> Door the Night that his Man had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
him the Rendesvouz was to be, he saw his Rival en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
there, and some time after a Coach stopping before <hi>Doro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thea's</hi>
Cousin's House, he observ'd both his Mistriss and her
Sister to come out thereof and go in there, which you may
imagine left him in no small rage, well knowing what se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
Communication there was between the two Houses. He
Plotted therefore from that very Minute to rid himself of so
formidable a Rival as <hi>Don Sancho</hi> might prove. The surest
way to take him off he thought was by Assassins, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
forthwith hir'd two for that end. With these he
watched for him divers Nights together, and at last met him,
and set on him with the assistance of his two Bullies, both
like himself well Arm'd. <hi>Don Sancho</hi> no sooner perceiv'd their
Intentions than he put himself in a posture of Defence, being
also indifferently well provided for that purpose, for over and
above his Sword and Ponyard he had two Pistols ready charg'd
and stuck in his Girdle. <hi>Don Diego</hi> was more forward to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
than his Companions, who were only led to it by the
thoughts of Gain. <hi>Don Sancho</hi> at first gave Ground, out of
Policy, till he had drawn his Assailants to a convenient di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
from the House where <hi>Dorothea</hi> was. But length fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
he might receive prejudice if he still continued on the
Defensive part, and perceiving <hi>Don Diego</hi> to press more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorously
than ordinary upon him, he let fly one of his Pistols
at him, and brought him to the Ground half Dead, but never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless
crying out and bawling for a Priest as if he were Mad.
At the bare hearing the report of a Pistol the Bullies immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
troop'd off. <hi>Don Sancho</hi> retired to his Lodgings, and the
Neighbours coming out of their Houses to see what was the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
found the Wounded Man just expiring, who nevertheless had
so much Life left as to accuse <hi>Don Sancho</hi> of his Murther.
This our <hi>Cavaliere</hi> had soon notice of, by means of his Friends,
who told him moreover, that altho' the Law could not reach
him, yet would not <hi>Don Diego's</hi> Relations let his Death be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reveng'd,
but rather seek all opportunities to Murther him
wherever they could meet him to Advantage. <hi>Don Sancho</hi>
hearing this, thought it his best way to retire to a <hi>Convent,</hi>
where he knew he might be safe, which he immediately did,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:53808:124"/>
and from thence sent his dear <hi>Dorothea</hi> an account of his Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
ordering his Affairs so in the mean time, that he might be
be ready to leave <hi>Seville</hi> at the shortest warning. Whilst mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
past thus, the Magistrates of the City were doing their
best to find <hi>Don Sancho</hi> out but to no purpose. After the
heat of the Search was a little over, and every body was of
opinion that he was clear got off, <hi>Dorothea</hi> and her Sister,
under pretence of Devotion, were carried by their Cousin to
the same Monastery whither <hi>Sancho</hi> was retir'd. There the two
Lovers had another Meeting in the Chappel, where they mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
promised eternal Constancy and Fidelity to each other, and
at parting utter'd so many moving Expressions, that <hi>Feliciana,</hi>
her Kinswoman, and the good Monk that attended them wept
exceedingly, and which they were always afterwards enclin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to do whenever the remembrance of this Interview came
into their Minds. <hi>Don Sancho</hi> soon after got from <hi>Seville</hi> in
Disguize, leaving Letters behind him with his Fathers <hi>Factor</hi>
to be transmitted to the <hi>Indies</hi> by the first opportunity. By
these Letters he gave his Father an account of what had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen
him, and which had oblig'd him to leave <hi>Seville</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
to <hi>Naples</hi> for the saving of his Life. He arrived there safe
in a little time, and was received very kindly by the <hi>Vice-Roy</hi>
to whom he had the Honour to have formerly belong'd Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
the great Favours shew'd him, he nevertheless
led but an uneasie Life in <hi>Naples</hi> for above a Year or more
and that because he had heard no News all that while of his
dear <hi>Dorothea.</hi> Some small time after the <hi>Vice-Roy</hi> equip'd six
Gallies to go out a Cruizing after the <hi>Algerines. Don Sancho</hi>'s
Courage would not suffer him to neglect so fair an occasion to
shew it self, and therefore he was resolved to engage in this
Enterprize. The Admiral that commanded received him on
Board his Gally, and lodged him in his own Cabbin, being
not a little proud that he had a Person of his Quality and Merit
to accompany him. These six <hi>Neapolitan</hi> Gallies <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>net eight
<hi>Algerines</hi> almost within sight of <hi>Messina,</hi> and were not long
before they engaged them. After a dubious Fight the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi>
took three of the <hi>Turks</hi> and sunk two. The <hi>Neapoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi>
Admiral happen'd to be grappled with the <hi>Turkish</hi> Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
which being better Man'd than the rest, had made a much
greater resistance. The Sea in the mean time grew rugged,
and the Storm encreased so fast, that at length both <hi>Christians</hi>
and <hi>Turks</hi> had more regard to their own safeties that to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
each others ruine. They as it were consented then
mutually to withdraw their Grappling-Irons, and disengage
themselves from one another, and which happen'd much about
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:53808:124"/>
the time that <hi>Don Sancho</hi> being over-bold had thrown him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
into the <hi>Turkish</hi> Admiral, without being so happy as to
have any body to follow him. Seeing himself thus alone, and
more than that, in the Power of his Enemies, he preferred
Death to Slavery, and immediately flung himself into the Sea,
hoping only to escape Drowning by his excellent Swimming.
But the bad Weather proving so extraordinary, it hindred him
from being discover'd by the <hi>Christian</hi> Gallies, altho' the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral
having been an Eye-witness of his Action, and being
extremely concern'd at the loss of him, which he look'd upon
as unavoidable, had tacked about towards the place where he
saw him leap in. <hi>Don Sancho</hi> in the mean time cut the Waves
with his Skilful Arms, and after having Swom a while to
the Leeward, whither both the Wind and the Tide carried
him, he by luck met with a Plank which had been torn
from the sides of one of the <hi>Turkish</hi> Gallies by the Cannon.
This he looked upon as a Present sent him from Heaven, and
which he immediately made use of with that success, that in
a short time he got a Shore on the Coast of <hi>Scicily,</hi> which was
not above a League and half from the place where the Battle
was fought. He landed without any prejudice done him by
the Rocks; and after having returned thanks to Heaven for

would suffer him. At last making shift to get up a little Hill,

                     </gap>he perceived from the top a Neighbouring Hovel, whither he
immediately went, and found it Inhabited by Fishermen, who
approved themselves to him the most charitable People in the
World. The over-heating himself in the Fight, and afterwards

he was forced to wear, brought so violent a Feaver upon

all that in him lay to make the World believe he was Dead,

knew he liv'd. Being inform'd that he was, he went im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
thither in a Fishers Habit, and arrived at the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quesses
House about Night. The Marquess was extremely
overjoy'd at the sight of a Friend whom he had given over for
<hi>soft, Don Sancho</hi> gave him an account how he came to be sav'd
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:53808:125"/>
and moreover told him his Adventure at <hi>Seville</hi> without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing
from him the violent Passion he had for <hi>Dorothea.</hi> The
Marquess proffer'd his service to go for him into <hi>Spain,</hi> and
to carry off <hi>Dorothea,</hi> and bring her to <hi>Sicily,</hi> provided she
would but consent to the doing of it. <hi>Don Sancho</hi> would by no
means put his Friend to so dangerous a trial of his Friendship
as to go alone on his account, and therefore proposed to go
along with him. <hi>Sanchez, Don Sancho's</hi> Man, had been so af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
for the loss of his Master, that when the Gallies came
into the Port of <hi>Messina</hi> to refresh themselves, he entred into
a <hi>Convent,</hi> resolving to pass there the remainder of his Days.
<hi>Fabio</hi> who had been the cause of his being admitted, sent
to the <hi>Superiour</hi> to release him again, and which was the
readier comply'd with, by reason he had not yet received the
Habit of the <hi>Order. Sanchez</hi> was over-joy'd at the sight of
his dear Master, and assoon shook off all thoughts of return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Monastery again. His Master not long after sent
him into <hi>Spain</hi> to prepare his way for him, and in the mean
time charged him to send him News of his dear <hi>Dorothea,</hi>
who like others had been possessed with the belief of his
Death. This Report had spread it self even to the <hi>Indies,</hi> and
which had caused his Father to die with regret, leaving four
hundred Thousand Crowns to another Son on Condition, that
if his Brother <hi>Sancho</hi> appeared again, he should refund to him
a Moiety. <hi>Don Sancho's</hi> Brothers name was <hi>Iuan de Peralta,</hi>
the same with his Fathers. His Father being dead he embark'd
for <hi>Spain,</hi> and arriv'd at <hi>Seville</hi> about a Year after the before
mention'd Misfortune had befel his Brother. Having a quite
different Name it was easy for him to conceal that they wer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
Brothers, and which he thought very necessary for him to do
since he was oblig'd to reside for some time in that City where
<hi>Sancho</hi> had left so many Enemies. He happen'd soon after to
have a sight of the fair <hi>Dorothea,</hi> and like his Brother, became
quickly enamour'd of her, tho' not with the same success. This
fair afflicted Lady could Love nothing after her dear <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho.</hi>
All that <hi>Don Iuan de Peralta</hi> could do to please her, prov'd
only tiresom to her, and she moreover utterly refused the be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.
Matches in <hi>Seville,</hi> which her Father <hi>Don Manuel</hi> had propose<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
to her. About this time <hi>Sanchez</hi> came to <hi>Seville,</hi> and observ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Master's Orders, immediately set himself about enquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into <hi>Dorothea's</hi> Behaviour. He learnt from a common Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
about the City, that a very wealthy Person lately com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>
from the <hi>Indies,</hi> had fallen desperately in Love with her, and
who omitted nothing to set forth his Gallantry and Affection<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>
This he soon inform'd his Master of, but made the Story much
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:53808:125"/>
worse than it was told him, and his Master believed it to be yet
worse than he related it. The Marquess <hi>Fabio</hi> and <hi>Don San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho</hi>
embarked not long after at <hi>Messina,</hi> on Board the Gallies
that were then returning to <hi>Spain,</hi> and arrived safe in a short
time at St. <hi>Lucar,</hi> where they immediately took Post for <hi>Seville.</hi>
It was Night before they got thither, when they went forthwith
to the Lodgings which <hi>Sanchez</hi> had assign'd them. They kept
all the next Day close in their Chambers, and, at Night took
a Walk towards <hi>Don Manuel's</hi> House. They there heard In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments
of several kinds runing under <hi>Dorothea's</hi> Window,
and afterwards an excellent Consort: when that was over a
single Voice, accompained only with a <hi>Theorbo,</hi> complain'd for
some time of the Cruelties of a Tygress in an Angels form<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <hi>Don Sancho</hi> was so provoked at this, that he certainly had truss'd
up the Serenaders, had not the Marquess <hi>Fabio</hi> prevented it by
representing to him that he could have done no more if <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rothea</hi>
had appear'd in the Balcony to encourage his Rival; but
since she had not, he ought to believe that the Words that were
Sung were rather Complaints of a dissatisfied Lover, than thanks
for any Favours receiv'd. The Serenaders retir'd after they had
perform'd their Task, and <hi>Don Sancho</hi> and the Marquess retir'd
also to their Lodgings. <hi>Dorothea</hi> began to be importun'd more
and more every Day by her <hi>Indian</hi> Lover. Her Father <hi>Don
Manuel</hi> was extremely desirous to have her speedily Married,
and therefore she feared that if <hi>Don Iuan de Peralta</hi> being Rich
and of so good a Family as he really was, should offer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to him for his Son-in-Law, he would easily be prefer'd
to all others, and she consequently more press'd by her Father
to Marry than she had hitherto been. The Day after the Sere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nade
<hi>Dorothea</hi> spent wholly in her Sisters Company, often tell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her, <q>That she could no longer suffer the Gallantries of the
<hi>Indian,</hi> and farther, that she could not but wonder how he
could make his Courting of her so publick, before he had
obtained her Fathers leave to Court her.</q> 
                     <hi>It is a thing that
extremely surprizes me likewise,</hi> reply'd <hi>Feliciana, and if I were
in your place, the first opportunity that offer'd, I would treat him
so ill, that he should ever after be out of Hopes either of saying
or doing any thing to please me. For my part,</hi> continu'd she, <hi>I
can't discover any Charms in him to please a Woman. He has not
that Air which is to be acquir'd only at Court, and the great Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences
he is at here has nothing of the</hi> Polite, <hi>and plainly shews
him to be a Stranger.</hi> She proceeded afterwards to finish a very
disadvantageous Character of <hi>Don Iuan de Peralta,</hi> not rememb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
that at his first appearing in <hi>Seville</hi> she had confest to
her Sister that she liked him, and that as often as she had
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:53808:126"/>
had occasion to speak of him she had always done it with some
sort of concern. <hi>Dorothea</hi> observing her Sister so alter'd, or at
least that she seem'd to be so, from the Opinion she had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
entertain'd of this <hi>Cavalier,</hi> presently suspected that she
loved him as much as she pretended to dislike him. She there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to clear her doubts told <hi>Feliciana</hi> that she had no manner
of aversion for <hi>Don Iuan's</hi> Person, but rather a respect, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
that she found so much of <hi>Sancho's</hi> likeness in his Face.
Her only reason for slighting him was because she could Love
no Man after <hi>Don Sancho,</hi> and she added farther, since she could
not hope to be his Wife she was resolv'd never to be one to
any other, but determin'd to spend the remainder of her
Days in a <hi>Convent. Altho' you were resolved upon such a strange
Undertaking, which I don't believe,</hi> reply'd <hi>Feliciana, yet you might
spare me the trouble of hearing of it.</hi> 
                     <q>Never doubt it, dear
Sister, answer'd <hi>Dorothea,</hi> for it is but too true, and it is
as certain that you will speedily be the richest Fortune in
<hi>Seville.</hi> It is therefore, continued she, that I would see <hi>Don
Iuan</hi> once more, to encline him, since he is not like to have
me, to have the same Love and Respect for you. But, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
she farther, when I do see him, I shall withal, desire
him to importune me no more with his Addresses, since I find
they are so very displeasing to you. And let me tell you, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
she further, that I know no Person in <hi>Seville</hi> to whom
you could be happier Married than to him.</q> 
                     <hi>If I said he
displeased me,</hi> reply'd <hi>Feliciana, I must own it was rather through
Complaisance to you than any aversion I had for him.</hi> 
                     <q>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
rather, dear Sister, quoth <hi>Dorothea,</hi> that you Love him,
and apprehend me for a Rival.</q> At these Words <hi>Feliciana</hi>
began to blush, and was extremely out of Countenance. She
proceeded to defend herself against her Sisters Accusation, but
which served rather to condemn than acquit her. At last she
found she was oblig'd to confess that she lov'd <hi>Don Iuan,</hi> which
she would nevertheless not have done had she believed it in her
power to have concealed it, <hi>Dorothea</hi> was so far from dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approving
her Sisters Passion', that she encouraged her in it,
by promising to serve her to her Power. Soon after <hi>Isabella,</hi>
who had broke off all Communication with her Friend <hi>Gus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi>
ever since the accident that befel <hi>Don Sancho,</hi> had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
from <hi>Dorothea</hi> to go immediately and find out <hi>Don Iuan,</hi>
and to tell him that she and her Sister desired his Company about
Midnight in the Garden, when her Father would certainly
be a Bed. She likewise bad her to carry him the Key of the
Garden-Gate. <hi>Isabella</hi> who had been gain'd over by <hi>Don
Iuan,</hi> and consequently had made it her business to procure
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:53808:126"/>
him her Mistrisses esteem, tho' without success, was extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
surpriz'd at this sudden change, but at the same time not a
little glad that she was to carry him so good News, who had
so often oblig'd her, tho' she brought him none but bad.
She made what hast she could therefore to his Lodgings, but
found him not inclinable to credit her Message, till she shewed
him the fatal Key. At the same time she put the Key into
his Hands, he put a perfum'd Purse with 50 Pistoles in it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
hers,
which she received with no less Joy than she had
occasion'd him by her coming. As ill-luck would have it, the
same Night that <hi>Don Iuan</hi> was to have admittance into <hi>Doro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thea</hi>'s
Fathers Garden, <hi>Don Sancho</hi> and his Friend the Marquess
happen'd to take their rounds that way. They were in the
Street where <hi>Dorothea</hi> lived about Eleven a Clock, when all
of a sudden four Men well Arm'd came up to them, and
star'd them full in the Face. <hi>Don Sancho</hi> thinking his Rival
might be among them, forthwith told them surlily, <hi>That the
Post which they had taken up there he had occasion for, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch
a certain Affair in, and therefore requir'd them to be gone
and give him Liberty for that purpose.</hi> To which they imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
reply'd, <hi>that they would do it with all their Hearts, but
that the place was as proper for them to execute a Design they
had in Hand, which he must give them leave to do before he
could find any room there.</hi> This answer so nettled <hi>Don Sancho</hi>
that it was only a Word and a Blow with him, for he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
set upon them with that Vigour that he soon put
them into disorder, and his Friend the Marquess charging
them at the same time, they were driven to the end of the
Street before they knew where they were. There <hi>Don Sancho</hi>
received a slight Wound, but in return gave his Enemy so home
a thrust that he was some time in getting his Sword out of his
Body, and whom he left for dead. In the mean time the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quess
was pursuing those that fled, which they quickly did
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>soon as they saw their Comrade fall. <hi>Don Sancho</hi> at last
saw several Lights comming towards him at a distance, which
suspecting to be the Watch, as it really was, he began to
think of his escape. He retir'd therefore in some confusion
through all the blind Allys he could find, and which at length
bringing him into a large open Street, he met full-but with
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n old Gentleman that was then lighting a long with a Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>trn,
and who had drawn his Sword at the hearing of <hi>Don
Sancho</hi> running towards him. This old <hi>Cavalier</hi> was <hi>Don
Manuel,</hi> who had been playing a game at Cards at a Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
House, and was now returning home after his usual
Custom through a little Gate of the Garden, which was near
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:53808:127"/>
the place where <hi>Sancho</hi> met him. At the first approach of our
Adventurer <hi>Don Manuel</hi> cry'd out, <hi>Who goes there?</hi> 
                     <q>A Man
answer'd <hi>Sancho,</hi> whose business 'tis to make the best of
his way, if you do not stop him.</q> 
                     <hi>It may be, Sir,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continu'd
<hi>Don Manuel, some Accident may have oblig'd you to
search in such haste for a Sanctuary, if so, my House is near at
Hand, and may, if it please you to accept it, be of Service to you</hi>
                     <q>'Tis true, reply'd <hi>Don Sancho,</hi> I am in quest of a Sanctuary
to screen me from a Pursuit which I fear is made after me,
and since you have been so generous as to offer a Stranger
the Protection of your House, he will trust himself wholly
in your Hands, and never forget both the Kindness and
Honour you will do him.</q> Hereupon <hi>Don Manual</hi> immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
open'd the Door with a Key he had always about him,
and put him in a Grove of Lawrels, whilst he went into his
House to seek for a better conveniency for him. <hi>Don Sancho</hi>
had not been long in the Grove before a Woman came to
him and Cry'd, <hi>Come away Sir, my Mistress</hi> Dorothea <hi>waits for
you.</hi> At the hearing of that dear Name, <hi>Don Sancho</hi> began
immediately to think that he was in his Mistresses Garden, and
that the Old Gentleman who had brought him in might be
her Father. He likewise suspected, with reason enough, that
<hi>Dorothea</hi> had made some Rival of his an Assignation, and that
this was the time of their Rendevezouz: He therefore fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
<hi>Isabella</hi> but that more tormented with Jealousy, than
the fears of a Pursuit. In the interim <hi>Don Iuan</hi> came at the
Hour appointed, and with the Key which had been given
him, open'd the Garden-door, and went and hid himself in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
Grove of Lawrels, whence <hi>Don Sancho</hi> was but just gone. A
Moment after he perceived a Man to come directly up to him<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
which at first gave him so much surprize, that he though<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
good to put himself into a posture of Defence; but obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
it to be <hi>Don Manuel,</hi> he endeavour'd only to conceal him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
<hi>Don Manuel</hi> soon finding him out, said to him, <hi>Come

which look'd out into the Garden, and where <hi>Dorothea</hi> and
<hi>Feliciana</hi> staid waiting for <hi>Don Iuan de Peralta,</hi> the one as a
Lover who was studying to say something to please him,
and the other as one that could not Love him, and design'd
there to tell him so. At <hi>Don Sancho</hi>'s entering the Room the
fair Sisters were wonderfully surpriz'd. <hi>Dorothea</hi> immediately
swoon'd away at the fright, and would have certainly drop'd
down on the Floor had not her Sister held her up in her Chair.
<hi>Don Sancho</hi> stood like a Statue: <hi>Isabella</hi> was ready to die with
fear, believing that <hi>Sancho</hi>'s Ghost was come to revenge the
wrongs her Mistress had done him while alive. <hi>Feliciana,</hi> tho' ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
frighted likewise, was nevertheless so employ'd about
recovering her Sister, that she did not so much mind it as she
would have otherwise done. At last <hi>Dorothea</hi> came to her self,
and then <hi>Don Sancho</hi> spoke to her after the following manner,
If the Report spread abroad of my Death did not in some
measure excuse your Inconstancy, ungrateful <hi>Dorothea,</hi> quoth
he, I should not have now Breath enough left wherewith to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
your Infidelity. But 'twas I that occasion'd that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,
to be forgotten of my Enemies, and not by you, who
have so often promised to Love none but me, and yet, who
have now so soon, nay, so treacherously broke that Promise.
I might well revenge my self, now I have an opportunity,
continued he, and complain so loud, that I might a wake your
Father, and he consequently rise and find your Lover, whom
you have hid in his House. But Fool that I am! I am yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raid
to displease you, and torment my self more with the thoughts
that I must love you no longer, than with those that so plainly
suggest to me that you love another. Go on, faithless Fair
one! Go on, proceeded he, enjoy your happy Lover; be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rehensive
of no danger in this new Amour; be assur'd that
will rid you speedily of the Man that has it in his power

                     </gap>ghters for being up so late, and afterwards went out of
Chamber, which he had no sooner done but <hi>Don Sancho</hi>
out likewise, and getting into the Garden hid himself as
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:53808:128"/>
before among the Lawrels, expecting an opportunity when he
might get away. <hi>Don Manuels</hi> business in his Daughters
Chamber was to light a Candle, wherewith to go to the
Garden-Gate, where the Constable and Watch were knocking
like Mad for admittance, having been told, that one of the
Persons that made the fray in the Streets was got in there.
<hi>Don Manuel</hi> made but little difficulty to suffer them to enter and
search his House, as believing that they would not open his
Chamber wherein he had hid the Gentleman he protected,
<hi>Don Sancho</hi> perceiving it was impossible for him to escape be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
found, amidst the great number of the Watchmen and Mob
that were spread all over the Garden, came out of his own
accord from the Lawrel-Grove, and going up to <hi>Don Manuel,</hi>
who was not a little surpriz'd to see him, whisper'd him in
his Ear, <hi>That a</hi> Cavalier <hi>of honour should always keep his Word,
and ought never to abandon one that he had once thought fitting
to take into his Protection.</hi> Hereupon <hi>Don Manuel</hi> desired the
Constable, who was one of his Friends, to leave <hi>Don Sancho</hi>
in his Custody, which request was readily granted him, being
a Man of Quality, and the rather, because the Wounded Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
was not yet Dead. After this the Constable and Watch
retired, and <hi>Don Manuel</hi> having discovered <hi>Don Sancho,</hi> and
finding by his Answers that he was really the Person he had
admitted into his Garden, he did not doubt but the other
must have been some Love-adventurer intended to have been
introduced to his Daughters by <hi>Isabella.</hi> To be the better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd
of the Truth, he desired <hi>Don Sancho</hi> to go into a Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
and not to stir thence till he came to him again, which
<hi>Sancho</hi> promised he would. In the mean time <hi>Don Manuel</hi>
went to <hi>Don Iuan de Peralta</hi> to whom he feigned that his
Servant had come into the Garden at the same time with the
Watch, and desired to speak with him. <hi>Don Iuan</hi> knew very
well that his Servant was Sick a Bed, and therefore could not
well come to him; besides, he had had no Orders from him
so to do, and moreover knew not where he was; all this to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
made him extremely concern'd at what <hi>Don Manuel</hi> had
said to him: Nevertheless, that he might not discover himself
thro' the want of a ready Answer, he immediately reply'd to
<hi>Don Manuel,</hi> at random, <hi>If you please, Sir, let him be ordered
to attend me at my Lodgings. Don Manuel</hi> then presently dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
him to be the young <hi>Indian</hi> Gentleman that had mad<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
to go out of his House till he had married her of his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
whom he could best fancy. He discours'd some time with
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:53808:128"/>
him, to be better satisfied in those matters which kept him still
in suspence. <hi>Isabella</hi> saw them talking together from the other
Door, and immediately went and told her Mistress of it. <hi>Don
Manuel</hi> soon perceived her, and thought she was coming to
bring a Message from one of his Daughters to <hi>Don Iuan,</hi> and
therefore left him, to run after her, and intercept her Design.
Just as he overtook her the Light that was in the Chamber
was burnt out. Whilst he was groping after her, being in the
Dark, <hi>Isabella</hi> got clear of him, and went and told <hi>Dorothea</hi> and
<hi>Feliciana</hi> that <hi>Don Sancho</hi> was in their Father's Chamber, and
that she saw them talking together. The two Sisters immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
run thither. <hi>Dorothea</hi> for her part was not affraid of
meeting her dear <hi>Don Sancho</hi> with her Father, being resolv'd
to confess how much she loved and was beloved by him, as
likewise for what end she had made that Assignation with <hi>Don
Iuan.</hi> She happen'd to come into her Father's Chamber just
at the same instant that <hi>Don Iuan</hi> was stealing out, whom she
taking for <hi>Don Sancho,</hi> caught by the Arm, and spoke to him
thus, <q>Why, cruel <hi>Don Sancho,</hi> doest thou thus fly from me,
and wherefore wilt thou not hear my Vindication against
the unjust Aspersions thou hast cast upon me? I confess you
could not have reproached me sufficiently, had I but been
guilty of what you have some sort of reason to believe me.
But you know there are many Falsities which sometimes have
as great resemblance of Truth as Truth it self, which is ever
best discovered by Time. Allow me therefore so much as
may serve to unravel this Confusion, wherein yours and my
Misfortune, and perhaps that of divers others, has involv'd
us. Help me to justify my self, and let not thy Passion which
hurries thee on to condemn me, provoke thee to pronounce an
unjust Sentence before a due Conviction. You may perhaps
have heard, continued she, that a certain <hi>Cavalier</hi> Loves me,
but did you ever hear that I return'd his Love? You may
likewise have seen him here, and it is most true that I have
sent for him, but when you shall also know for what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
I am pretty well assured you will repent of your cruel
Usage to me, and be inclinable to own that I could give
you no greater proof of my Fidelity. Why is he not now
in thy Presence, this Spark that importunes me so frequently
with his Passion, that I might have an opportunity to ask
him before thee, whether I ever gave him leave to profess he
loved me, or if he ever had any reason to believe I had read
his Letters? But my Misfortune is such, added she sighing, that
as often as I would have shun'd him, he has appear'd before
me, but now I have occasion for him to clear my Innocence
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:53808:129"/>
he is absent.</q> 
                     <hi>Don Iuan</hi> had so much patience as to hear all
she could say without giving her the least Interruption, and
that chiefly that he might thereby discover what she had all
along before kept a Secret from him. At last, just as he was
going to reproach her with baseness, <hi>Don Sancho,</hi> who had been
groping from Room to Room to find the way into the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
and still missing it, at length came so near as to hear <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rothea</hi>
talking with <hi>Don Iuan,</hi> whom he knowing by her Voice,
approached them as softly as he could, but was notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
soon discover'd by <hi>Don Iuan</hi> and the two Sisters. At the
same Moment <hi>Don Manuel</hi> came into the Chamber with Lights
carried before him by two Servants. Hereupon the two Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val
Brothers presently star'd each other in the Face, looking
fiercely, and laying their Hands upon their Swords. <hi>Don Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel</hi>
stept in between them to prevent any mischief, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
commanded his eldest Daughter to make choice of
one of them, who as her Husband might be authoriz'd to
chastize the other. <hi>Don Iuan</hi> then began to speak, and told <hi>Don
Manuel</hi> that for his part he resign'd up all Pretentions to the
<hi>Cavalier</hi> that was before him, but that not through fear. <hi>Don
Sancho</hi> said the same thing, adding moreover, that since <hi>Don
Iuan</hi> had been introduced into <hi>Don Manuel</hi>'s House by his
Daughter, it was probable that she both loved him and was
beloved by him, and therefore for his part, he would die a
thousand Deaths before he would marry one with the least
scruple upon her. Then <hi>Dorothea</hi> throwing herself at her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
Feet, conjured him to hear her. She related to him all
that had passed between <hi>Don Sancho de Sylva</hi> and her, to the
time of his killing of <hi>Don Diego</hi> on her account. She after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
informed him how <hi>Don Iuan de Peralta</hi> had made love
to her, and what designs she had to disabuse him, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
her Sister to him in Marriage; and to conclude all, she
told him that if she could not perswade <hi>Don Sancho</hi> to believe
her innocent, she was resolv'd next Day to shut her self up in
a Nunnery, thence never to set Foot out again as long as
she lived<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> By this relation the two Brothers came to the
knowledge of each other. <hi>Don Sancho</hi> was forthwith reconciled
to <hi>Dorothea,</hi> whom he demanded in Marriage of her Father.
<hi>Don Iuan</hi> likewise beg'd <hi>Don Manuel</hi>'s consent to have his
Daughter <hi>Feliciana,</hi> and both were accepted by him for hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

desired her of her Brother in Marriage. His request was
granted with a great deal of readiness; the Gentleman being
presently sensible what advantage such a Match must be to
his Family. The three Marriages were solemniz'd in one Day,
and every thing succeeded so well that there was no disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greements
between either of the Parties for a long while after,
which you must confess is not a little to be wonder'd at.</p>

Hat dropt off, took him for a Champion that had purposely
presented himself to try his Courage with him, and therefore
drawing back four or five Paces, as good Jumpers are wont
to do, he ran full speed like a Horse in his full Carrier, with
his horny Head against <hi>Ragotin</hi>'s bald Pate, which no doubt he
would have shatter'd as much as a Piss-pot could have been,
when thrown upon the Stones, from the top of a high Tower,
had it not been <hi>Ragotin</hi>'s peculiar Fortune that the Assault was
made while he had his Head up, so that he received no other
dammage than a superficial Graze on the Cheek by one of the
Ram's Horns. All the Company was so extremely surpriz'd
at this Action, that they remained for some time astonish'd,
which nevertheless could not hinder them from laughing. This
gave the Ram an opportunity, having been used to make his
course more than once, to have another run, which it seems,
he performed so inconsiderately, that he run only against his
Knees, and therefore only wounded his Hands, which had each
of them a Horn to stand the brunt of. <hi>Ragotin</hi> finding his Face
to bleed and smart, tho' he was a little stunn'd, yet began to
recover himself, and having open'd his Eyes, which he did not
do till the second shock, he soon discover'd the Author of his
Misfortune, which he had no sooner done, but he fell to bela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
of him about the Head, till the hardness of his Horns
made him to withdraw his Hands, which finding to be all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
bruiz'd, as well by buffetting as sustaining, he flew into
a great rage, threatning revenge to all the Company if they did
not desist from laughing at him. He afterwards would have

                  <p>IN the last Chapter of the Second Part of this Romance, you
have had little <hi>Ragotin</hi> all bloody with the several repeated
buttings he received from the Ram, whilst he slept in a low
Chair in the Comedians Chamber, and which occasion'd him
to go out thence in a great fury. But he had received so deep
a Wound from Madam <hi>Stars</hi> Eys, and was withal so desirous
of knowing the issue of the <hi>Operator's Scheme,</hi> that he could only
afford himself time to wash his Face and Hands before he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned.
As he was just entering the Inn again, his Brain was
so disturb'd, what with the Blows, and what with the Darts,
that he mistook an Advocate then walking by to the Hall, for
<hi>Ferdinando</hi> the Operator. He therefore accosted him very ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villy,
and began with him after this manner, <hi>Sir, I am happy
in meeting you so luckily; I have long desired this opportunity, and I
was just going to your Lodgings, in great hast, to have a farther account
from you of what concerns either my Life or Death. I don't doubt
but you have employ'd the utmost of your Art, in Schemes, to serve
me all the time you slept, and I desire you to believe I would by no
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:53808:132"/>
means be ungrateful in my Acknowledgements. Tell me then I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech
you dear Doctor;</hi> continu'd he, <hi>will this little charming,
shining</hi> Star <hi>suffer me to share any of her Influence?</hi> The Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate,
who understood not a tittle of all the fine Words had
been spoken to him, and taking them for Railery, was not long
before he interrupted him. <q>Monsieur, <hi>Ragotin,</hi> quoth he, if
it had been a little later I should verily have thought you
had been drunk, but notwithstanding, I cannot help believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that you are either a Mad-man or a Fool. To whom
for God sake do you think you are talking, added he, and
what the Devil makes you talk to me of Schemes, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences
of Stars? Do you take me either for an Astrologer
or a Magician? Prethee consider a little Monsieur <hi>Ragotin,</hi>
proceeded he, Don't you know me?</q> 
                     <hi>Ah! Sir,</hi> reply'd <hi>Rago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin,
How unkind you are, I thought I had too well inform'd you of
my Malady, to have been refused a Remedy. Alass! I could

when the Advocate left him in a great Passion, telling
him at parting, <hi>That he was a great Sot for a little Man. Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotin</hi>
would have followed him, but that he at length per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
his Mistake, and therefore was glad to retire with shame.
He had so great regard to his Reputation, as to keep this a
Secret; and I'll assure you, I had never come to know it had
not the Advocate one Day told it me, among others of his Friends,
to divert us. The little Fool afterwards turned into the Inn, and
went directly to the Comedians Apartment, which he had no
sooner enter'd, but he heard a Proposition made by Mrs. <hi>Cave</hi>
and <hi>Destiny,</hi> to quit <hi>Mans,</hi> and retire to some other Post. This
vexed him so heartily, that he was like to have dropt down
from his height on the Floor, and which he might have safely
done, since he had no great way to fall. But what concern'd
him most was, that the time of their departure was to be the
next Morning, when they were to bid adieu to the good Town
of <hi>Mans,</hi> and particularly to its Inhabitants, who had been
their constant Auditors for some time. They purposed to take
their way to <hi>Alençon</hi> after the old rate, having been assured
that the Pestilence was not there, as they had been before in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd.
I say they took their way after the old rate, for these
sort of People have a constant rule of Travelling, in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
as the Sun has in the <hi>Zodiack.</hi> The Journies they had made
and were to make in this Country, were first from <hi>Tours</hi> to

being made by all the Men and Women Players unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously,
they proposed to play one of their best Plays, before
they left <hi>Mans,</hi> to the end they might leave their Audience
there in good Humour. What this Play was, never came to
my Knowledge. That which obliged them to go away so sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly,
was by reason that the Marquess <hi>d'O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>se,</hi> on whose ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
they had staid so long, was commanded instantly to
Court, insomuch that being like to have no Benefactor left
after he was gone, and the <hi>Mansean</hi> Audience diminishing every
Day, they purposed to go where they might be better used.
<hi>Ragotin</hi> would needs be endeavouring to oppose this Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of theirs, for which purpose, he gave a great many bad
Reasons, whereof he had always store at command, but which
were little or nothing regarded. This vexed the little Man ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely,
insomuch that he beg'd of the Company not to go
presently out of the Province of <hi>Maine,</hi> but to take first the
Tennis-Court, which was in the Suburbs of <hi>Montfort,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
they might go to <hi>Laval</hi> in <hi>Maine</hi> likewise, whence
they might easily come into <hi>Britany,</hi> according to their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
made to Monsieur <hi>de la Garrouffiere.</hi> This Opinion of
<hi>Ragotin</hi>'s <hi>Destiny</hi> would by no means agree to, affirming that
if they took his Advice, they should make no Work on't, the
pittiful Tennis-Court mention'd by him being a great way out
of the Town, and more than that, on the other side of the
River, which would be the reason that none of the better sort
of People would come near them; when the great Tennis-Court,
in the Sheep-Market of <hi>Alençon,</hi> was just in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
of the Town, and moreover, surrounded with all the best
Houses, and therefore it were better to give something more
for such a place, than any thing for the despicable Tennis-Court
at <hi>Montfort,</hi> whose good Market was the only reason
that <hi>Ragotin</hi> had to speak for it. This last Proposition was
agreed to by the whole Company, and therefore they imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
order'd a Waggon to be got ready for their Baggage,
and Horses for their Women. The care of procuring these was
left to <hi>Leander,</hi> who having a great many Intrigues in <hi>Mans,</hi>
was the likeliest Man to have the best Acquaintance there.
Next Day, before they set out, they presented a <hi>Comedy, Tragedy,
Tragi-Comedy</hi> or <hi>Pastoral,</hi> I know not whether, but which had
the success that you may imagine. The Players were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir'd
by every Body, and <hi>Destiny</hi> perform'd wonders, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
in his manner of taking leave of the <hi>Audience;</hi> for he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd
his Acknowledgments and Unwillingness to leave them
with that tenderness and force, that he charm'd them to that
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:53808:133"/>
degree, that as I am inform'd, some among them wept. <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotin</hi>
was so concern'd that his proposal had not been follow'd,
that he remained for some time like a Dolt, sitting in his Chair,
even after the rest of the Company was gone, and where I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
he had sat till now, had not the Market of the Tennis-Court
let him know that no body was left, which he had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless
no small trouble to make him comprehend. Being at
last prevail'd upon to be gone, he rise from his Chair and went
home, where he resolved to go find out his Company the next
Morning, and discover to them what shall be related in the
following Chapter.</p>

                  <head type="sub">Where you'll find Ragotin's Design.</head>
                  <p>THE Criers of <hi>Aqua Vitae</hi> had not yet wak'd those that
were in a profound sleep, when <hi>Ragotin</hi> being already
drest, was going to propose to the Strolling Company his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations
to be admitted amongst them. He went then to the
Players Lodgings, whom he found neither up nor awake, and
happen'd to have the Discretion to leave them as he found them.
Nevertheless he could not help entering one Chamber, where
he found <hi>Olive</hi> abed with <hi>Rancour.</hi> This last he desired to get
up, and walk with him to <hi>la Cousture,</hi> a fine Abby in the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbs
of the same Name, and thence to go to Breakfast at the
great golden Star, where he had order'd a Collation to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
for them. <hi>Rancour,</hi> who was one of those who love to
eat at other Mens costs, was almost assoon got ready as the
proposition was made him, and which you may be easily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd
to believe, if you consider that these sort of People are
accustom'd to dress and undress behind the Scenes, to Act dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Parts, which will admit of but little delay. <hi>Ragotin</hi> and
<hi>Rancour</hi> then march'd on towards the Abby of <hi>la Cousture;</hi>
but we must suppose that they called at some Church by
the way to say a short Prayer, for <hi>Ragotin's</hi> Thoughts that he
had in his Head would not admit of a long one. He never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless
acquainted <hi>Rancour</hi> with nothing of the matter for fear
it might have kept him from his Breakfast, which he knew
he had a greater Inclination for than to give Ear to any thing
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:53808:133"/>

pâtéz</hi> he had order'd were not yet got ready. To which the
Hostess answer'd, without rising off from the seat where she
sat; <hi>Truly Monsieur</hi> Ragotin, <hi>I know not how you could expect
that I should divine when you would come; but since you are now
here, the</hi> Pâtéz <hi>shall not be long after you: Pray walk into the
Hall, where you'll find a Cloth laid, and a</hi> Westphalia <hi>Ham to
stay your Stomach.</hi> This she spoke after a grave Hostess-like
manner, and which inclined <hi>Rancour</hi> to be on her side, who
turning to <hi>Ragotin,</hi> cry'd, <hi>Sir, pray let us comply with my Host<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>esses
Proposal, and take a Glass or two while our Breakfast is
getting ready.</hi> They sat down to Table, which in a very
short time after was cover'd, and they Breakfasted after the
<hi>Mode</hi> of <hi>Mans,</hi> that is to say, very heartily. They Drank
the same, and put about several Healths, among which the
Reader may imagine Madam <hi>Stars</hi> was not forgot. Little
<hi>Ragotin</hi> tost up above a dozen Glasses successfully, sometimes
sitting and sometimes standing with his Hat in his Hand. But
at last he would needs drink his Mistresses Health on his Knees
and bare-headed, which made him to look just for all the World
as if he had been doing Penance at the Door of some Church.
It was then that he earnestly reminded <hi>Rancour</hi> of his Promise
to assist him in the Conquest of Madam <hi>Star's</hi> Heart. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<hi>Rancour</hi> half angry, or at least feigning to be so, ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wered
him a little roughly. <hi>I thought Monsieur</hi> Ragotin <hi>you
had known that I was a Man that never embark'd without Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition,
I mean engaged in any thing that I were not able to bring
about. Be satisfied I will omit no Opportunity to serve you. I
tell you so again, and have ways in my Head whereby to compass
it. But I see one great Obstacle in our way, and that is our sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
departure from hence; the only method therefore that I can
advise you in, to bring about your Ends, is to be resolv'd to be
admitted amongst us. You have all the Qualifications for it that
can be desired. You have a good Mien, a strong Voice, a good
Tone, and a better Memory: and in a Word, you seem to
have nothing about you that looks Country. You appear to
have lived all your Life time at Court, having so much the
Air of it, that you might be known for a Courtier above a
Mile off. You need not,</hi> proceeded he, <hi>to Act above a dozen times
before you'll be able to out-start all our young Pretenders, who
must resign up the chief Parts to you, and then leave the
rest to me. As for the present,</hi> quoth he, <hi>you'll have but
a tough bit of her; you must manage her with Policy, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with I know you to have sufficient, but however a little In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:53808:134"/>
may not be amiss. I would advise you therefore not
to let her know your design at your first entrance into our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
for that would certainly be the way to lose her, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to keep her in suspence till you have a convenient oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
to make your Addresses, and after you have sufficiently
won upon her by your Conversation, which I dare promise
you'll soon do.</hi> The little Man had been so attentive to <hi>Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour</hi>'s
discourse, that he was almost ravish'd into an Extasy,
imagining that he had already, as we say, the Wolf by the
Ears, when coming to himself all of a sudden, as it were
out of an Apoplexy, he started from the place where he sat
and went to the other side of the Table to embrace <hi>Rancour,</hi>
whom he thanked heartily for his Councel, and begged of
him to continue his Friend in this Affair, protesting at the
same time that his only Design in inviting him to Break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast
was to have declared his Mind to him concerning his
being admitted of his Society, and which he resolv'd forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
to be. After this they reckon'd with their Landlady,
and <hi>Ragotin</hi> paid all. When they were out of Doors they
took their course directly towards the <hi>Scrollers</hi> Lodgings, which
was not far off from where they had been. They found the
Women up and drest; but <hi>Rancour</hi> had no sooner open'd
<hi>Rogotin</hi>'s design to them than he was interrupted by a Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger
from <hi>Leander</hi>'s Father, who sent his Son Word by him
that he was Sick to Death, and desired to see him before
he paid that Debt to Nature, which all Men must.
This obliged all the Company to lay their Heads together
and consult how they should bear against an Accident so
unexpected. <hi>Leander</hi> took <hi>Angelica</hi> aside and told her that
his time was now come to live Happy if she would but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
towards it, otherwise he must be unfortunate tho'
Rich, and Poor tho' he had a good Income. She promised
him all the Favours that lay in her Power, and particularly
those you will meet with in the next Chapter.</p>

                  <head type="sub">Leander's Project and Harangue, together with
Ragotin's Admission among the Strollers.</head>
                  <p>THE Jesuites of <hi>la Fleche,</hi> not having been able to make
<hi>Leander</hi> continue his Studys, and perceiving his Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
ran high to be a Player, presently concluded that he must
be in Love with some Actress or other, and which they were
altogether confirm'd in, when after the departure of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
they found he had followed them to <hi>Anvers.</hi> They
therefore thought themselves oblig'd to acquaint his Father there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
by a Messenger on purpose, which they soon after did,
and who arrived just as a Letter was delivered the old Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
from <hi>Leander,</hi> whereby he gave his Father to understand
that he design'd for the Wars, and therefore desired a sum of
Money to accoutre himself. This Stratagem had been laid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Destiny</hi> and him, when he first discovered his Quality to
him at the Inn where he was Wounded. His Father soon dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering
the Cheat, flew into an excessive Passion, which to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with his great Age, threw him into a Distemper that
quickly concluded his Life. Perceiving his end to approach
he called one of his Tenants to him, and commanded him im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
to go find out his Son, which he told him he was
most likely to do among the <hi>Strollers.</hi> This the Farmer knew
as well as he, having been the Man that had furnish'd <hi>Leander</hi>
with Money from the time that he had left the College, so
that understanding that there was a Company of <hi>Strollers</hi> at
<hi>Mans,</hi> he made all the haste he could thither, and found his
young Landlord as you have heard in the foregoing Chapter.
<hi>Ragotin</hi> was desir'd by the Company to leave them for some
time to confer with the Tenant newly arriv'd, which you may
imagine he was very unwilling to do, yet at last he retired in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
an adjoining Chamber, where he waited with great impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
till their Business was over. They had no sooner got
him out of the Room but <hi>Leander</hi> brought in his Father's Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant,
who immediately related the bad Condition the old Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
was in, as likewise his earnest desire to see his Son
before he died. Thereupon <hi>Leander</hi> immediately craved leave
to comply with his Father's dying Request, which was judg'd
reasonable to be granted by the whole Company. It was then
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:53808:135"/>
that <hi>Destiny</hi> revealed the Secret of <hi>Leanders</hi> Quality, which
he had all along kept private, and which he did not come to
the knowledge of till after the ravishing of Madam <hi>Angelica,</hi> as
you may have read in the Second Part of this true History.
He thought it now high time to let it be known, as well to
disabuse Mrs. <hi>Cave,</hi> who could not get it out of her Head but
that <hi>Leander</hi> was either the Principal or Accessory in the carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
off her Daughter, as to oblige him who had done him
the Honour to be his Serving-Man, and would have continu'd
so had he not found himself oblig'd to tell who he was, while he
was in quest of Madam <hi>Angelica.</hi> He was moreover so far from
consenting to the carrying away of <hi>Angelica,</hi> that having met
with her Ravishers he had hazarded his Life in her Assistance,
but that not having been able to resist so many People, he
had been dangerously Wounded, and left for dead upon the
place. All the Company then immediately asked his Pardon
for not having treated him according to his Quality, which
they thought themselves the more excusable for by not having
any knowledge of the Matter. Madam <hi>Star</hi> added farther,
that she had always suspected something from the great store
of Wit and Merit she had observ'd in him, and which she
was afterwards confirm'd in, especially when she saw her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Mrs. <hi>Caves</hi> Letters from him; nevertheless she did not
know what to think when she saw him so employ'd in her
Brothers Service. Then began Mrs. <hi>Cave</hi> to speak, Addressing
her self to <hi>Leander</hi> after the following manner. <hi>Truly, Sir,
after I had in some measure discover'd your Quality, by the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
you writ to my Daughter, I had no small reason to distrust
your Sincerity, being not enclinable to believe that a Person who
was to have so good an Estate after his Fathers death, would ever
condeshend to marry a poor Stroller. But,</hi> continued she, <hi>I thank
God the time is at length come that you are to be made happy in
plentiful Possessions, and I am to be deliver'd from a future
possibility of being any more impos'd upon by your false Pretentions.
Leander</hi> being extremely surpriz'd at these Words, quickly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd,
<q>All that you say, Madam, I am likely to possess,
would not render me a jot happy, if I were not assur'd at
the same time of the Possession of your Daughter <hi>Angelica.</hi>
Without her I renounce all the Fortune which Nature and
my Father's Death shall cast upon me, and I declare to you,
before all this good Company, that I go with so much
willingness to enter upon my Succession, upon no greater
account than to return speedily to perform my Promise to
Marry your Daughter, which I here once more confirm,
and will speedily accomplish, providing both she and you will
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:53808:135"/>
do me the Honour to afford your Consents. And if so <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
he,</hi> I would not have you to think, that I design to carry
her to my own Home; that is not at all in my Intentions,
for I have found so much Pleasure in a Strolling Life, that
I could never be perswaded to quit so many worthy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions
that have so largely contributed towards it.</q> After this
obliging Declaration, both the Actors and Actresses speaking al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together,
return'd him their most humble Acknowledgments,
averring at the same time, that Mrs. <hi>Cave</hi> and her Daughter
would not be a little to blame if they refused so advantageous
a proffer. <hi>Angelica</hi> for her part, said no more than became one
that was at her Mother's disposal, only she bid <hi>Leander</hi> at part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to <hi>Hope,</hi> if he continued in the same mind at his return.
After all the mutual Endearments and Tears that commonly
pass between parting Friends, it was agreed that <hi>Leander</hi> should
go the next Morning upon one of the Horses that had been
hired; but which he refused, chusing rather that of his Tenant,
which he thought would carry him better, and would leave the
Hackny for his Companion. <hi>But we forget all this while,</hi> quoth
<hi>Destiny, that Monsieur</hi> Ragotin <hi>is waiting without to speak with
us. Is there none among us,</hi> added he, <hi>that knows what he
would have?</hi> Hereupon <hi>Rancour,</hi> who had been silent for some
time, open'd his Mouth, to let them know that he knew,
and that that very Morning he had treated him with a Break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast
to procure himself an opportunity to acquaint him that he
had a mind to be admitted of the Company, without pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to any share in the Profits, having sufficient of his own,
and which he would rather chuse to spend in seeing the World
than to live altogether at <hi>Mans,</hi> as he had been advised to do.
Hereat <hi>Roquebrune</hi> presently advanced to give his Opinion that
he ought not to be admitted, and that for these Reasons, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause,</hi>
said he, <hi>two Poets under one Roof never agree, it being with
them as with Women, where there are more than one there are too
many. Besides,</hi> quoth he, Ragotin'<hi>s shape would never suffer him
to be an Ornament to the Stage, but would rather disgrace it: For,</hi>
added he, <hi>What Parts could he propose to Act? As for the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
ones Monsieur</hi> Destiny <hi>would not permit him to undertake
them, and for the second best they belong to</hi> Olive. <hi>And then for
a Nurse or a Confidente,</hi> continu'd he, <hi>he must not pretend to ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of them, his Person being altogether as deform'd in a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guize
as out of one. Therefore,</hi> concluded he, <hi>'tis my Opinion in
few Words, that be ought by no means to be received.</hi> 
                     <q>And 'tis
mine, reply'd <hi>Rancour,</hi> that he ought by all means to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
for where there is occasion to represent a Dwarf none
can be so propper, and then for a Monster, as that in <hi>Andro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meda,</hi>
                        <pb n="274" facs="tcp:53808:136"/>

                        </gap>
be at the trouble to contrive one that would be only Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial.</q>
He added farther, that as for speaking a Part he could
assure them he would be like another <hi>Orpheus,</hi> that drew every
thing after him. <q>For, <hi>proceeded he,</hi> whilst <hi>Olive</hi> and I were
seeking after Madam <hi>Angelica,</hi> we overtook him riding upon
an Ass no bigger than himself, and repeating the Adventures
of <hi>Pyramus</hi> and <hi>Thysbe,</hi> with so good an Emphasis, that seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Rusticks that were then going the same way, came up with
him, and gave so constant attention with their Hats off, that
they would not leave him till they came to the Inn where
we all baited. If then, <hi>continued he,</hi> he could gain so far up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
these Rusticks what will he be able to do when he comes
to speak before Men of Sense?</q> This Relation made every
body to laugh, and the Company was thereupon resolved to
hear <hi>Ragotin</hi> speak for himself. He was sent for in, and after
about a dozen low <hi>Congées</hi> he began his Harangue in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
manner. <hi>Illustrious Personages, and August Senate of</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nassus,
quoth he, fancying himself, no doubt, speaking at the
Bar of the <hi>Presidents</hi> Court in <hi>Mans,</hi> where he had been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
Advocate but a little before, <hi>It is a common saying,</hi> That
evil Company corrupts good Manners, <hi>and on the contrary, good
must needs improve them.</hi> This <hi>Exordium,</hi> so well begun, made
the Company believe that he was about to preach a Sermon,
therefore they turned their Heads one way, and t'other, and
could hardly forbear Laughing. Some Criticks perhaps may
think much of the Word <hi>Sermon;</hi> but why might not <hi>Ragotin</hi>
be thought capable of performing such a Task, when he had
several times sung <hi>Ballads</hi> to the Organs? But however, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded.
<hi>I find my self so destitute of Vertues, that I desire to be
admitted of your Illustrious Society for improvement: You are the
Muses Interpreters, the living Ecchoes of their dear Darlings, and
your Merits are so well known throughout all</hi> France, <hi>that you are

themselves happy in Celebrating your Praises. And for you Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi>
continu'd he, <hi>no</hi> Alexander <hi>nor</hi> Caesar <hi>ever equal'd the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
of Monsieur</hi> Destiny, <hi>nor of the other Heroes his Companions,
and therefore you must not wonder if I am ambitious of encreasing
your number by one, which will be easy for you to suffer me to do,
if you can but consent to it, I promise you moreover</hi> proceeded
he, <hi>that I will be no manner of charge to ye, neither will I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend

to any share in the profits of our Performances, but all along
continue your most Humble and most Obedient Servant. Ragotin</hi>
having thus ended his Harangue, he was desired to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
for a Minute, that the subject of what he had said
might be consider'd. He withdrew, and the Company was
just going to proceed according to Form, when the Poet <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quebrune</hi>
threw himself in again to make a second opposition
to <hi>Ragotin</hi>'s Preferment, but he was presently thrust out by <hi>Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour,</hi> who had pushed him more violently but that he had
regard to his new Suit which was bought with the Money
he had lent him. At length it was agreed that <hi>Ragotin</hi> should
be admitted amongst them for the diversion of the Company.
He was thereupon call'd in, the accustom'd Ceremonies passed,
was enroll'd in the Register, took an Oath of Fidelity, had the
Word given by which the <hi>Strollers</hi> knew one another; and
after all, supp'd with the whole <hi>Caravan.</hi>

Breeches in two Places. In the mean time <hi>Leander</hi> took oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
to entertain his dear <hi>Angelica</hi> with Love Storys, and to
whom he reiterated his design to Marry her, which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd
with so much softness and tenderness that she could
answer him only with Tears, whereof she shed abundance. I
know not whether these proceeded from her Joy at the fair
Promises he made her, or through her concern for his so sudden
departure; however it was, 'tis certain they exchanged seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
mutual Endearments, which were not in the least interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Mrs. <hi>Cave.</hi> But at length Night drawing on a pace,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> was convenient they should both retreat. <hi>Leander</hi> took leave
of the Company and went to Bed. Next Morning he got up
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="4 letters">
                        <desc>••••</desc>
                     </gap>times, and set out with his Fathers Tenant, with that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>dition
that he quickly arriv'd at his Journies end, where
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:53808:137"/>
he found the old Gentleman very ill, who nevertheless told
him he was glad to see him. He likewise expressed to him
as far as he was able, the great Grief his absence had caus'd
him, as also that he was now come seasonably to receive his
last Blessing together with his Estate, altho' he had been advis'd
to disinherit him for the ill courses he had taken. The rest
of <hi>Leander</hi>'s Affairs we shall learn at his return. The Actors
and Actresses being got ready drest, they took care to pack
up their Baggage as fast as they could, that they might be ready
to depart in good time. At length all was prepar'd and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
was wanting, except a Horse for one of the Women,
which they had before provided, but were disappointed in.
They therefore had desired <hi>Olive</hi> to take care to get another just
as <hi>Ragotin</hi> enter'd the Room, who hearing their proposition told
them there was no occasion, by reason he had one that would
carry double, and if they pleased either Madam <hi>Star</hi> or <hi>Angelica</hi>
should ride behind him. This he urg'd the rather, because
he told them it was impossible that they should reach <hi>Alençon</hi>
in one Day, being above 10 Leagues off; but being oblig'd to
make two of it, his Horse would serve well enough for the
purpose he proposed. Whilst he was thus recommending his
Contrivance, Madam <hi>Star</hi> interrupted him, affirming she could
not ride double; this vexed the little Man extremely, but which
he was a little after the better satisfied with, when <hi>Angelica</hi> told
him she would. They Breakfasted all together that Morning,
and the <hi>Operator</hi> and his Wife were invited; but whilst the
Collation was getting ready, <hi>Ragotin</hi> took an occasion to talk
farther with Signior <hi>Ferdinando,</hi> to whom he made the same
Speech that he had done before to the Advocate, whom he had
taken for him, to which the Magician answer'd, that he had
try'd all that lay within the compass of his Art to serve him
but without effect, which made him inclinable to believe that
Madam <hi>Star</hi> knew more of Magick than he; that her Cha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

would have reply'd to these Reflections on his Mistress, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

whither they were going, it being certain that the People would
sooner run after them where they paid nothing, than go to
see a Play where they must pay. The Company thanked both
the Husband and Wife for their Civilities and return'd them a
thousand Acknowledgments for their good Will.
The Women
wept, and a great many Compliments pass'd between both Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
only the Poet, who upon other occasions would have talk'd
as much as four, upon this spoke not one Word, the parting
with <hi>Inezilla</hi> being so cruel a Thunder-stroke to him, that tho'
he fancied himself all over cover'd with Laurel, the common
Preservative against Thunder, yet could he not secure his Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cass.
The Waggon being loaded, and ready to set out, Mrs.
<hi>Cave</hi> took her place as she had done formerly, in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of this <hi>Romance,</hi> Madam <hi>Star</hi> mounted upon a Horse which
<hi>Destiny</hi> led, and <hi>Angelica</hi> got up behind <hi>Ragotin,</hi> who took care
to avoid the same accident in mounting as had before befallen
him. All the rest went on Foot in the same order as they
came to <hi>Mans.</hi> When they were got to a little Wood about
a League from the Town, a Stag that was then Hunting by the
Marquess of <hi>Lavardin</hi>'s Servants, happen'd to cross the Road,
which <hi>Ragotin</hi>'s Horse that went before perceiving, was extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
affrighted at, which obliging <hi>Ragotin</hi> to quit his Stirrups, he
at the same time clap'd his Hand on the Carabine he had by
his side, and thinking to kill the Stag, he happen'd to touch
the Trigger before he had well mounted the Piece, whereby, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
greatly charg'd, the Carabine recoil'd, and threw him off,
and striking at the same instant against <hi>Angelica's</hi> side forc'd
her off likewise, but who received little or no harm. As for
<hi>Ragotin,</hi> it was his Misfortune to fall against the slump of a
Tree, which was about a Foot out of the Ground, whereby he
got a bump on his left Temple, which by a Bandage with a
piece of Silver instead of Lead was soon cured. This Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
caus'd a great deal of Laughter in the Company, after
they saw there was no more harm done, but which they would
otherwise have forborn. The little Man nevertheless was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
enrag'd at their making a jest of his Misfortune. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
remounted, together with <hi>Angelica,</hi> he would needs charge
his Carabine again, but which she would by no means suffer
him to do. They then proceeded on their Journy, and at last
came to a little Inn where they were to bait. The Actors for
their parts must take an Afternoons Luncheon, and the Actres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
proposed to lye on the Bed, as well to repose themselves
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> to observe how lustily their Companions Eat and Drank.
The briskest Drinkers were <hi>Rancour</hi> and <hi>Ragotin,</hi> who were so
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="4 letters">
                        <desc>••••</desc>
                     </gap>tly engag'd to <hi>Angelica</hi>'s Health, which they thought no
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:53808:138"/>
body had observ'd, that she was forc'd to call out to the
latter to bid him drink less and take more care of his charge
for the future. This caused a Cessation of Arms, or rather of
Glasses between the two Combatants. After some time the
Reckoning was paid, and the Horses brought out, and they all
set forwards on their Journey. The Weather was fine, and
the Road good, which permitted them to arrive betimes at a
Town called <hi>Vivain.</hi> They there went to the Sign of the
Cock, being the best Inn in the Town. The Hostess, who was
none of the best Natur'd Women in the Province of <hi>Maine,</hi>
made a great deal of difficulty to receive them, telling them that
she had no Bed room. Her Company it seems was a <hi>general Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver,</hi>
an <hi>Excise man,</hi> and four or five Pedlers. <hi>Rancour</hi> think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to give a cast of his Office, told his Landlady that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
only a Chamber for the Women, and as for the Men they
would pig in any where. This calm dealing somewhat abated
the Pride of our Lady-Hostess. She admitted them therefore,
and they did not unload their Waggon, but lock'd it up in a
Stable which they found at the bottom of the Yard. The Women
had a Chamber assign'd them, where the Company all Supp'd
together. After Supper the Men retir'd, leaving the Women
to go to Bed in two Beds, <hi>viz.</hi> Madam <hi>Star</hi> in one, and Mrs.
<hi>Cave</hi> and her Daughter <hi>Angelica</hi> in the other. You may im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agine
they did not forget to take the Key in the inside of the
Door, as did not likewise the two <hi>Receivers,</hi> who had order'd
their Portmantues top full of Money to be brought into their
Chambers. But the unwary Pedlers were not so cautious, for
they took not that care, but admitted <hi>Rancour</hi> and <hi>Olive</hi> to lie in
the same Room where they had their Packs. There were three
Bed in the Room, whereof the Pedlers had two, and <hi>Rancour</hi>
and <hi>Olive</hi> the other one. <hi>Rancour</hi> slept not a wink all Night,
watching for an opportunity to put his design in execution when
the Pedlers were a sleep. At last he got up, thinking they
were fast, and going softly towards the Packs, he was inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
by one of the Pedlers, who being overtaken with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
Looseness, was forc'd to rise to ease his Belly. This made
<hi>Rancour</hi> to return in some haste to his Bed. In the mean time
the Pedler who had been used to lodge in this Inn, and knew
all the ways out and in, went to a Door that open'd into a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Gallery, at the end whereof was the House of Office. Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>

he did not to incommode the venerable Comedians with a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

smell. When he had done he went to return from whence <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
came; but instead of going the right way, he descended <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
the other side, and went by a private Door into the <hi>Receivers</hi>
Chamber, where approaching the first Bed he met, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:53808:138"/>
it his own, he heard an unknown Voice demand of
him <hi>Who was there?</hi> This caus'd him to turn, without saying
a Word, to the other Bed, where he heard the same thing, but
spoke with a more angry Accent. This last Person call'd out
at the same time for a Candle, affirming there was some body
in his Room. Hereupon the Host made the Servant to rise
immediately, and see what was the matter; but before she
could possibly strike a light, the Pedler had got out of the
Room, and was coming into his own Chamber, but before
he came, <hi>Rancour</hi> that had heard all the difference between
him and his Neighbours, for there was was only a thin Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
between them, resolv'd to lose no time, and therefore
having dexterously unty'd the Cords of one of the Packs, he
took out thence two pieces of Linnen, which having done, he
fasten'd the Cords again as artificially as if they had never
been open'd; for he knew perfectly well that Secret, known
only to those of his Fraternity, as well as he did their Marks
and Cyphers. He was just going to attack another of the
Packs when the Pedler entred the Chamber, who hearing him
walk about demanded <hi>Who was there? Rancour</hi> who never want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
an Excuse at a pinch, after having thrust the two pieces
of Linnen into his own Bed, told him that the Maid had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
to set him a Chamber-pot, and that therefore he was look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for the Window to piss out at; whereupon the Pedler,
who was not yet got into Bed, reply'd, <hi>Stay, Sir, if you please,
I'll go open it for you, for I know better where it is than you do?</hi>
This having not only said but done, he immediately leap'd
into Bed, and left <hi>Rancour</hi> to piss out at the Window, which he
did as copiously as when he bedew'd the Merchant of lower
<hi>Maine,</hi> while he lay with him in an Inn at <hi>Mans,</hi> as
you may find that he did in the Tenth Chapter of the First
part of this <hi>Romance.</hi> He afterwards went directly to his
Bed, without shutting the Window. The Pedler cry'd out to
him that he ought not to have left it open, and he cried out
to the Pedler that he might shut it if he pleas'd, for as for his
part he should not trouble his Head about it any more, having
scarce been able to find the way to his Bed when it was shut.
The Pedler fearing <hi>Rancour</hi> had a mind to make a Squabble of
it, rise without any more ado and shut the Window, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
grop'd his way out to Bed again. All this while the
Host and Hostess were bawling like Mad at their Maid to
light the Candle, which she was endeavouring to, but as
the Proverb has it, <hi>The more haste the less speed,</hi> this sorry
Wench had been above an Hour blowing the Small-coal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
she could raise a spark of Fire. This caus'd her Master
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:53808:139"/>
Mistress to Curse her at no common rate, and the <hi>Receivers</hi>
began to be more and more enraged to find they could not
get a Candle, when they had called for it so often. At length
it was lighted, and the Host, and Hostess, and Servant went
together into the <hi>Receivers</hi> Room, where finding no body, they
told them they had done ill to alarum all the Family for no
reason. But they on the contrary maintained that they had
both seen and heard a Man in their Chamber, and more than
that, had talk'd with him. The Host hearing this, went in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the <hi>Strollers</hi> Chamber, and demanded of them and the Ped<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
whether any of them had been in their Neighbours
Room? They all answer'd, <hi>No, none of us had been out of Bed
except that Monsieur yonder,</hi> meaning <hi>Rancour, who was forc'd
to rise to piss out at the Window, your Maid not having set him
a Chamber-pot.</hi> Hereat the Host presently fell on the Servant
for her neglect, and afterwards went to the <hi>Receivers</hi> again,
telling them they must needs have Dreamt that some body
was in their Room, since not a Soul had been stirring that
way as he could hear of. After this he left them, wishing
them to go to sleep again, it not being yet Day. Assoon as
it was well light <hi>Rancour</hi> got up, and demanding the Key
of the Stable, went to hide the purchase he had got in the
Waggon.</p>

a Road where in the hottest Summer there is Dirt, and wherein
the Horses often plunge up to their Bellies. Being not able to
conclude the matter amongst themselves, they consulted the
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:53808:139"/>
Waggoner, who told them his Horses would carry them through
the worst of Quagmires, they being the very best for Draft of
any in <hi>Mans.</hi> Also that they had not above half a Mile of
bad way, whereas if they went by the Common of St. <hi>Pater,</hi>
they would find the Roads dirtier, and longer continue so.
He remember'd them likewise, that the Horses and Waggon
only would go in the Dirt, and that the Foot People might
step over into the Fields and walk there secure. At length they
pitch'd upon the former Road, and Madam <hi>Star</hi> desired the
Waggoner to let her know when they came to the Dirt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
she chose rather to go on Foot in good way, than to ride
on Horse-back through a Bog. Of the same mind were <hi>Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lica</hi>
and Mrs. <hi>Cave,</hi> who had some apprehensions that the
Waggon might overturn, When they were just about enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

<hi>Roquebrune</hi> whip'd up upon <hi>Stars</hi> Horse, and followed
<hi>Ragotin,</hi> who went just after the Waggon. When they were
got into the very worst place of all the Road, and where
there was only room for the Waggon to pass safe, they met
about twenty Carriers Horses, driven by five or six Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
Fellows, who bawl'd out like Mad to the Waggoner to
stop, but which he little regarded, requiring the same thing

the Carriers thinking to get the better by their expedition trot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
briskly up to him, and bawl'd out so loud that the Wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goners
Horses took fright and broke their Traces, throwing
themselves at the same time into the Bog, whilst the Waggoner
endeavouring to keep his Waggon from following them, weigh'd
one of the Wheels too much on the other side, which finding
no firm Ground to support it overthrevv the vvhole Machine
in the Mud. Hereat <hi>Ragotin</hi> being extremly incens'd against

thunder'd out Anathemas against them like one possess'd, and

Legs from out of his Stirrups, but likevvise to quit his Saddle,
and leap off into the Bog, vvhere he presently sunk so deep
that he vvas up to his Armpits, and had been quickly to
his Chin if he had not extended his Arms. This unexpected
Accident caused all the Passengers that travelled in the Fields
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:53808:140"/>
to stop and lend their assistance. Poet <hi>Roquebrune</hi> likewise,
who had hitherto out brav'd all the Assaults of Fortune, was
now glad to retire to a dry place. The Carriers perceiving so
many Men for their Enemies, all arm'd with Fusces, thought
it but prudence to retire as fast as they could, and take to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Road. In the mean time it was judg'd highly necessary to
remedy the disorder that had happen'd as soon as possible, and
therefore they propos'd to begin with Monsieur <hi>Ragotin</hi> and his
Horse, who were both in no small danger of being Suffocated.
<hi>Olive</hi> and <hi>Rancour</hi> were the two first that ventur'd to assist
them; but the nearer they approach'd them the deeper they
sunk in the Mud, insomuch that having try'd several places,
and found them all the same, <hi>Rancour,</hi> who had always an
Expedient at Hand in Cases of Necessity, proposed without
laughing to draw <hi>Ragotin</hi> out of the danger, wherein he was,
by one of the Cart Ropes, one end to be fasten'd to his Neck
and the other to the Horses, who were then got out into the dry
Road. This Proposition made all the Company to laugh ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
<hi>Ragotin,</hi> who was not a little affraid of its being executed
upon him, nevertheless, at last the Waggoner, who had run a great
hazard in getting out the Horses, did the same for him, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch
that seizing him fast by the Collar, he at several pulls
drew him out of his hole, and drag'd him into the Fields where
his Company were waiting for him, who could not forbear
laughing to see him in that pickle. This done, the Waggon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
returned to bring out the Horse, who beginning to exert
himself, by the help of a little whipping flounc'd about the
Mud, and at length got quite out. Last of all <hi>Olive, Rancour,</hi>
and the Waggoner, being all-over bemir'd with Dirt, joined to
get out the Waggon, which they soon performed by their uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Endeavours, and loaded it again with the Baggage. The
Horses were put in again into their Traces, and <hi>Ragotin</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted
his Courser, tho' that with some difficulty, his Girts
being all broken. <hi>Angelica</hi> would by no means get up behind
him again, for fear of spoiling her Cloaths. Mrs. <hi>Cave</hi> and
Madam <hi>Star</hi> chose to walk on Foot likewise, all whom <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiny</hi>
accompanied to the Sign of the <hi>Green Oaks,</hi> which was
the only Inn to be met with between <hi>Mans</hi> and the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbs
of <hi>Montfort.</hi> Here they staid, not caring to enter the
Town in the Condition they were in. After those that had
took the most pains had drank to refresh themselves, they spent
the rest of the Day in drying their Cloaths, having taken
fresh to put on out of their Trunks, which variety had been
presented them by the Gentry of <hi>Mans.</hi> The Actresses supp'd
but lightly, having lost their Stomacks by the great fatigue
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:53808:140"/>
they had undergone in Walking, and which inclined them to
go soon to Bed. The Actors not only Eat but Drank heartily
before they would go to Bed. They were in about their first
sleep, being near Eleven a Clock at Night, when a company
of Men came and knock'd at the Gate of the Inn, asking
for Beds. The Host answer'd them his Lodgings were full,
and besides, that it was an unseasonable time o'Night for
them to require any. Notwithstanding this Answer they knock'd
the more, and threaten'd to break down the Gate unless it were
speedily open'd to them. <hi>Destiny,</hi> who had always carried <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daigne</hi>
in his Mind, thought that this must needs be he, who
was come to carry <hi>Star</hi> away by force; but having look'd
out of the Window, he perceiv'd by the help of the Moon,
that then shone very bright, a Man among them with his Hands
tied behind him, which having whisper'd to his Companions
who were all ready prepar'd to receive <hi>Saldaigne; Ragotin</hi> cry'd
out it was Monsieur <hi>de la Rappiniere,</hi> who had got some High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
Man into his Custody, for that he was in quest of one.
They afterwards were confirm'd in this Opinion, when they
heard them from without command the Host in the King's
Name to open the Gates. <hi>But why the Devil,</hi> quoth <hi>Rancour,
could they not have carried their Prisoner to</hi> Mans, <hi>or to the</hi> Vis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>county
<hi>of</hi> Beaumont, <hi>or at worst, Why could they not go to</hi> Fres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nay?
<hi>At all which places there are Prisons, when there is none
here. There must,</hi> proceeded he, <hi>be some Mystery in this.</hi> The
Host thought himself however oblig'd to open to <hi>la Rappiniere,</hi>
who entred with Ten Archers and a Prisoner bound after the
manner I have told you. This Prisoner was in a merry Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
and could not forbear laughing, especially as often as
he look'd upon <hi>la Rappiniere,</hi> which he often did steadfastly,
and which was the reason that he was not carried to <hi>Mans.</hi>
Now you must know <hi>la Rappiniere,</hi> having had notice that there
were several Robberies committed, and Houses broken open
and pillag'd, set himself diligently about looking after the
Rogues. As it happen'd, whilst he and his Archers were
hunting about for them near the Forest of <hi>Persaine,</hi> they saw
a Man come out of the Wood, who perceiving a company of
Horse-men, return'd with haste in again, which caus'd <hi>la Rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piniere</hi>
to believe that he must needs be one of those he look'd
after. Having caught him they were extremely surpriz'd that
he answer'd only confus'dly, and yet at the same time laugh'd
in <hi>la Rappiniere</hi>'s Face, who the more he look'd upon him the
more he fancied he had seen him somewhere, but could not
remember where. The reason of his not being able to recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
himself was, that at the time of their Acquaintance short
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:53808:141"/>
Hair and long Beards were worn, but this Man had long Hair
and no Beard, and moreover wore different Cloaths from what
he did when they were acquainted. All this entirely disguiz'd
him from <hi>la Rappiniere</hi>'s Knowledge. <hi>La Rappiniere</hi> when he
went to Bed, which he did after he had well supp'd, commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
him to the Custody of two of the Archers, who tied him
to an old fashion'd Bench in the Kitchen, and so went to sleep
in their Chairs, leaving him to do the like if he pleased on
the Pavement. Next Morning <hi>Destiny</hi> was up first in the
House, who going into the Kitchen, saw the Archers asleep in
their Chairs, and a Man with his Hands ty'd behind him,
fasten'd to a Bench, and lying along awake upon the Stones,
who making a sign to him, to come near him, he was not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
surpriz'd, when the Prisoner ask'd him <hi>If he did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
that he was once robb'd on the</hi> Pont-neuf <hi>at</hi> Paris,
<hi>and lost among other things a small Picture in a Box? I was
then,</hi> continu'd he, <hi>with the Sieur</hi> la Rappiniere, <hi>who being at
that time our Captain, forced me to attack you. You know all that
passed besides. I have learn'd,</hi> proceeded he, <hi>that you have been
inform'd of all by</hi> Doguin, <hi>on his Death-Bed, and I have likewise
understood that</hi> la Rappiniere <hi>has restor'd you your Box, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless,
you have now a fair opportunity to revenge your self
on him. As for my part,</hi> added he, <hi>should they carry me to</hi>
Mans, <hi>as I do not know but they may, I should be surely hang'd
there; but then,</hi> concluded he, <hi>it is also in yours and my Power
to make him dance the same Dance. It is but joining your
Evidence with mine, and you may guess how a Iury of</hi> Mans
<hi>would deal by him. Destiny</hi> having heard this left the Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
and waited for <hi>la Rappiniere</hi>'s rising. Being come down
Stairs he met him in an Entry, and taking him aside, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
him with all that the Highway-Man had told him,
adding withal, that he might well see he was not revengeful,
since he declined taking advantage of what he had heard, and
instead thereof, advis'd him to be gone, and leave the Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal
to shift for himself. <hi>La Rappiniere</hi> would have
staid till the Actresses were stirring, had not <hi>Destiny</hi> frankly
told him that Madam <hi>Star</hi> could not behold him without
the most just Indignation imaginable. He insinuated to him
moreover, that if the <hi>Vnder-Baily</hi> of <hi>Alençon</hi> should come
any ways to hear of his Crime, he would certainly send
quickly to seize him. This he himself was likewise inclin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to believe, and therefore having first unloos'd the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner,
and set him at Liberty, he mounted on Horseback,
together with his Archers, pretending to them that he had
been mistaken in the Man, and went his way without pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:53808:141"/>
his Reckoning, according to custom, and likewise without
returning <hi>Destiny</hi> thanks; but which last Omission was wholly
to be attributed to the Disorder and Confusion he was in.
After he was gone, <hi>Destiny</hi> called up <hi>Roquebrune, Olive</hi> and
the <hi>Decorator,</hi> and they went together into the Town, to the
great Tennis-Court, where they found six Gentlemen playing
a <hi>Partie.</hi> They presently went to enquire for the Master of
the Court, and those that were in the Gallery knowing they
were Players, acquainted the six Gentlemen therewith, and
that there was amongst them one of a better Mien than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary.
The Gentlemen after a little while finish'd their <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,</hi>
and went up Stairs to be rubb'd and dry'd, whilst <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiny</hi>
came into the Court, and discoursed the Master. At
length the Gentlemen came down again half drest and saluted
<hi>Destiny,</hi> asking him several Questions concerning his Company,
particularly how many they were? Whether there was any
good Actors among them? If they had good Cloaths? And
whether their Women were handsom? All which Questions
<hi>Destiny</hi> answer'd to their Satisfaction, in return for which
Civility, they ofter'd him all the Service they were capable
of doing him, and having desir'd the Master to help them
on with the rest of their Cloaths, they told <hi>Destiny</hi> they would
gladly drink with him, if he would but have patience till
they were quite drest. <hi>Destiny</hi> accepted their proffer, being
glad to get as many Friends as he could to assist him, in
case <hi>Saldaigne</hi> should pursue him, which he was yet under an
apprehension of. In the mean time the Hire of the Tennis-Court
was agreed on, and the <hi>Decorator</hi> was dispatch'd to the
Joiner, to give him orders to fit up a Play-House according
to his Model. The Gentlemen being at length drest, <hi>Destiny</hi>
Addrest himself to them with so graceful a Mien, and so much
good Sence, that they soon conceived a more than ordinary
kindness for him. They demanded of him where his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
lay, and having understood from him that it was at
the <hi>Green Oaks</hi> in the Suburbs, they proposed to him to go and
drink a Glass, and eat a bit with him and his Friends where
he pleased. A place was nam'd, and they met altogether ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
the Women, where they Breakfasted heartily. You may
imagine their discourse was chiefly about Acting and Plays.
They afterwards went altogether to the Womens Lodgings,
whom they found just setting down to Dinner, which was the
reason that the Gentlemen staid but little with them; but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless
long enough to offer them all the Service and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
imaginable, which was much in their Power to perform
being the very top Gentry of the Town, After Dinner their
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:53808:142"/>
                     <hi>Strolling</hi> Baggage was carried to the <hi>Golden Cup;</hi> being the
Lodging <hi>Destiny</hi> had taken for them, and after a little while
their Theatre being ready, they began to Act, in which Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
we will leave them to shew they were no Novices, and
return to see what became of <hi>Saldaigne</hi> after his fall.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. VI.</head>
                  <head type="sub">Saldaigne's Death.</head>
                  <p>YOU have seen in the Twelfth Chapter of the Second
Part of this <hi>Romance</hi> how <hi>Saldaigne</hi> kept his Bed in the
Baron <hi>d'Arque</hi>'s House in <hi>Verville</hi>'s Appartment, on account of
a fall, as likewise, how his Servants had got so unmercifully
drunk in a Country Inn, not above two Leagues off from the
said House, and where <hi>Verville</hi>'s Man had no small trouble to
make them comprehend that the Lady they had in charge was
escap'd, and that the Man his Master had sent along with
them followed her on another Horse. After they had a little
rubbed their Eyes, and yawn'd three or four times a piece,
as also stretch'd out their Arms as often to adjust their Chine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bones,
they put themselves into a posture of pursuit. <hi>Verville</hi>'s
Man nevertheless led them a quite contrary way from what the
Lovers had taken, and that by his Masters Orders, so that hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
wandred about for two or three Days in a Fruitless search,
they at last return'd to their Master <hi>Saldaigne,</hi> who was not
yet either out of his Bed or Cured of his fall, and related to
him that the Lady had got from them, but that the Person
whom Monsieur <hi>Verville</hi> procur'd them was gone after her.
<hi>Saldaigne</hi> was like to run Mad at the first hearing of this News,
and soon gave his Servants to understand, that it was well
for them that he was confin'd to his Bed, for had he been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to stand, or to lift but one Leg from out of the Sheets,
he would have made them sensible by innumerable Bastinado's,
that their intolerable Negligence was not to be excused by
Words. He flew into that violent Passion, and thunder'd out so
many Curses against them, that he quite baffled the Surgeon's Art,
and brought the Fever again upon him, so that when he came
at Night to dress him, he apprehended a Gangreen in his Thigh,
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:53808:142"/>
from the great Inflammation his Disorder had occasion'd there.
He also observ'd a kind of livid Colour on the part, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a farther bad Symptom, caused him to go immediately and
find out <hi>Verville,</hi> to whom he related the whole unfortunate
Accident. <hi>Verville</hi> seem'd much astonish'd at the relation, and
wonder'd how the occasion of such an Accident could happen,
which he nevertheless knew well enough, having been inform'd
of all before by his Servant. He notwithstanding pretended
a great deal of Ignorance, and went immediately to visit <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daigne,</hi>
till having enquir'd the cause of his Alteration, and
hearing it from his own Mouth, he at length redoubled his
Grief by confessing to him that he had been the contriver
of what had befallen him, and that rather to have done
him a Service than Diskindness, which had been never in
his Thoughts. For said he to him, <hi>You may remember that no
body would entertain this Woman when you run away with her,
and I declare to you, that tho' I did suffer your Wife, my Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
to lodge her within my Fathers House, yet it was only with
design to procure an opportunity to restore her to her Brother and
Friends. Tell me I beseech you,</hi> proceeded he, <hi>what do you think
would have become of you, if Information had been given in against
you, and you had been taken up for a Rape? Could you have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
your Pardon think you, and don't you yet know that the
King never passes by Crimes of that nature? You fancied per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,</hi>
added he, <hi>that the meanness of her known Birth, and the
baseness of her Profession would in great measure have got you
excused; but do not slatter your self in that, for I would have
you to know, that she is the Daughter both of a Gentleman and
Gentlewoman, and therefore your hopes would fail you there. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,</hi>
continu'd he, <hi>tho' all the efforts of Iustice should not be
able to hurt you, yet remember that she has a Brother who would
surely be reveng'd on you for debauching his Sister. He is a Man
of Courage you know, and you have experienc'd it in divers Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters,
therefore one would think that single Consideration should
encline you rather ro value than persecute him as you have long
done. 'Tis high time now to cease that vain Pursuit, or you
may quickly come to repent of not having done it.</hi> This Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
that one would have thought might have both enclin'd
<hi>Saldaigne</hi> to have reflected and repented, served rather to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
his Resentments, and make him entertain strange re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions,
which tho' he dissembled for the present to <hi>Verville,</hi> yet
he endeavour'd afterwards to put in practise. He made
what hast he could to get cur'd, and as soon as he found
himself in a Condition to mount a Horse, he took leave of
<hi>Verville,</hi> and at the same time posted towards <hi>Mans,</hi> thinking
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:53808:143"/>
to have found the Company of <hi>Strollers</hi> there, but having
been inform'd that they were gone thence to <hi>Alençon,</hi> he forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
resolved to follow them thither. Passing by <hi>Vivain</hi> he
baited his Men, and three Cut-throats that he carried along
with him at the Cock, where the <hi>Strollers</hi> had lodg'd. He
was no sooner come into the Yard but he heard a great
noise. Upon enquiring into the Matter it appear'd to be the
Pedlers, who having been going to a Fair at <hi>Beaumont</hi> had
on the Road discovered the Theft committed on them by
<hi>Rancour,</hi> and were return'd to complain to their Hostess, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
satisfaction, but who told them she thought her self
not oblig'd to make it them, by reason that they did not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trust
her with their Packs, but had had them carried into their
Chamber. <hi>That's true,</hi> quoth the Pedlers, <hi>but why the Devil
did you put us to lodge in the same Room with those Iugglers,
those Mountebanks, for no doubt it was some of them that robbed
us?</hi> 
                     <q>Well, <hi>reply'd the Hostess,</hi> but did ye find any of your
Packs slit or torn, or the Cords unloos'd?</q> 
                     <hi>Neither of all
three,</hi> answer'd the Pedlers, <hi>and that is that which most sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes
us, for we found the Cords ty'd after the same manner as
we had left them in.</hi> 
                     <q>How then would you have me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair
your loss, <hi>quoth the Hostess,</hi> get you about your busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
for a Company of Impudent Rogues?</q> The Pedlers
were just a going to reply when <hi>Saldaigne</hi> Swore that if they
did not cease their bawling he would beat them most unmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifully.
The poor Pedlers thereupon seeing so many lusty Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
all disguiz'd, thought it but prudence to hold their Peace,
however waited for an opportunity when they were gone to
renew their dispute with the Hostess. After <hi>Saldaigne</hi> and his
Men and Horses had refresh'd themselves a little, they set
forward for <hi>Alençon,</hi> where they arrived very late. <hi>Saldaigne</hi>
for his part could not sleep a wink all Night, and that for
thinking on the manner of revenging himself on <hi>Destiny</hi> for
taking his Booty from him, and as his Inclinations had been
always brutal, so were the Resolutions he came to. Next
Day he resolved to go to the P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ay, which was <hi>Pompey the
Great of</hi> Corncille, and sent one of his Companions before
to take places for four. As for himself he came muffled up
his Cloak to avoid discovery, but the rest were in <hi>Querpo,</hi> being
not known. All the time the Play was acting he was as much
tormented as the Audience was pleas'd, for all admir'd at the
admirable action of Madam <hi>Star,</hi> who represented <hi>Cleopatra.</hi>
When the Play was ended, <hi>Saldaigne</hi> and his Friends staid
behind all the Company, being resolv'd to attack <hi>Destiny</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they went away. But how luckily were they prevented,
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:53808:143"/>
for this Company of <hi>Strollers</hi> had gain'd so far both upon
the <hi>Nobless</hi> and all the best Citizens of <hi>Alençon</hi> of either Sex,
that they never came to the Theatre, or return'd thence, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a great number to attend them. The same Night a young
Widow-Lady, by name <hi>Ville Fleur,</hi> invited the Actresses to Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
in <hi>Saldaigne</hi>'s hearing, which they out of Modesty declin'd
accepting of, but being pressed thereto with a great deal of
obliging Compulsion, they at length consented, and promised
to come. After which they retir'd likewise, but accompanied
as the Men, with a great number of Persons of the best Note.
Among the rest were those Gentlemen that <hi>Destiny</hi> found at the
Tennis-Court when he first came to hire it. This second de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat
almost made <hi>Saldaigne</hi> despair, till at length he resolv'd on
one of the most villainous Actions that could be thought on by
Man, and that was to carry off <hi>Star</hi> when she came out of
Madam <hi>Ville Fleur</hi>'s House, and to Stab all those that opposed
him, under covert of the Night. The three Actresses went to
wait on the Lady according to their Promise, and great numbers
of Gallants came likewise to wait on them. Now <hi>Saldaigne</hi>
imagin'd it as easy to carry off <hi>Star</hi> at this Juncture, as he had
found it to be before, when she was conducted on Horseback
by <hi>Destiny</hi>'s Man. He took therefore one of the strongest Horses
he had, and putting him into the Hands of one of his Men he
plac'd him at one of the Doors of Madam <hi>Ville Fleur</hi>'s House,
which open'd into a narrow Street near the Pallace, believing
that upon some slight pretence or other he might get her out
of the House, and then he would mount her on Horseback,
and carry her whither he pleased. Whilst he was thus feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Fancy with vain Chimera's, and imagin'd his Booty
already in his possession, and <hi>Ecclesiastick</hi> who lov'd good Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
and had scrap'd some small Acquaintance with our <hi>Strol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,</hi>
happen'd to be going that Night to Officiate his <hi>Vespers</hi>
at Madam <hi>Ville Fleur</hi>'s, and who perceiving a Lackey, whose
Livery he did not know, to stand at her Door, began to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
of him, <hi>Who he was, what he did there, and whether his
Master was in the House?</hi> To all these Questions the Fellow
answer'd so confusedly that the Priest had just reason to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
him a Rogue. He went therefore up into the Room,
where all the Company was, and gave them account of what
he had observ'd, telling them moreover, that he feared that
there was an Ambuscade laid for some body or other, for
that he had heard several People walking about in the darker
part of the narrow Street. <hi>Destiny</hi> had taken notice that one
of the Audience had hid his Face in his Cloak, and having his
Enemy <hi>Saldaigne</hi> always in his Thoughts, did not doubt but
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:53808:144"/>
that must have been he; nevertheless he concealed his Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,
and thought it sufficient for the present only to Guard
the Women to Madam <hi>Ville-fleur</hi>'s House, where they were to
sit up all Night, with as much Company as they could get;
but when he came to understand from the <hi>Ecclesiastick</hi> what
I have before told you, he immediately concluded that <hi>Saldaigne</hi>
was once more contriving to carry off his dear <hi>Star.</hi> This
caus'd him and his Company to enter into an immediate
Consultation what they had best to do. At last they conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
they would wait the event, and if no body appear'd among
them before they broke up, they would go away with as much
caution as they could. Whilst they had just determin'd what
to do, an unknown Person enter'd the Room, and enquir'd for
Madam <hi>Star.</hi> Upon her coming to him, he inform'd her that
a Lady of her Acquaintance desir'd to speak a Word with her
in the Street, and begg'd she would only come down for a
Moment. Every body then presently knew that this was the
Method <hi>Saldaigne</hi> had proposed to himself to procure the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
of his Mistress by, and therefore immediately got them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
into a posture to receive him. It was not thought sit
that any of the Actresses should be suffer'd to go down, and
therefore they borrow'd one of Madam <hi>Ville-fleurs</hi> Chamber-Maids
for that purpose. She was no sooner come into the
Street but <hi>Saldaigne</hi> seiz'd her, and offer'd to mount her up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his Horse; but he was not a little surpriz'd when he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
himself surrounded on all sides with arm'd Men, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
some had come by the great Door round the Market-place,
and the others by the lesser Door. Hereupon <hi>Saldaigne,</hi> who
had always had no more Consideration than his Horse, and
scarce so much, let fly a Pistol among them, and slightly
wounded one of the Actors before he well knew whether they
were come as his Friends or his Enemies. This rash attempt
had half a dozen Shot immediately return'd, whereof one en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terd
his Head, and two others his Body. His Companions
who were out upon the Scout hearing a noise of several dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charges,
instead of coming up to assist their Friend, fled in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continently,
as such rascally Bullies commonly do where they
find any resistance. A light was forthwith called for, to view
the wounded Man who was fallen on the Ground; but no body
knew him except the <hi>Strollers,</hi> who assured the Company that
it was <hi>Saldaigne.</hi> He was thought to be dead, tho' he really
was not, and which occasion'd the By-standers to lend his
Lackey their assistance to throw him athwart his Horse. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
carried after this manner to his Lodging, when he came
there his Host presently discover'd some signs of Life in him,
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:53808:144"/>
and consequently did all that lay in their power to recover
him, which notwithstanding prov'd ineffectual, for he died
the next Day after. Being dead his Corps was carried into
his own Country, where he was received with feign'd Sorrow
by his Sisters and their Husbands, both lamenting outwardly
for their loss, but inwardly they were not a little glad of his
Death. And I dare be bold to say, that Madam St. <hi>Far</hi> his
Wife, wished him no better Fate. In the mean time Justice
was fain to bestir her Stumps a little in quest of the Murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
but no body being found, nor any body making a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint;
besides, the Persons that could be most suspected being
of the best Gentry of the Town, the Prosecution was let fall.
The Actresses were conducted to their Lodgings, where they
learnt the next Day that <hi>Saldaigne</hi> was dead, which caused them
to rejoice exceedingly, being thereby out of danger of any
future Disturbance, meeting every where with Friends, except
in him and his Adherents.</p>

to a little Church situate in an Island made by the
River <hi>Sartha,</hi> and between the two Bridges of <hi>Alençon.</hi> You
must not wonder if both the Actors and Actresses of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of <hi>Strollers</hi> receiv'd a benefit from a Priest, since you
might have perceiv'd throughout the whole Comical Adventures
of this famous History, how many Services and good Offices
have been done them by <hi>Curates.</hi> This <hi>Prior,</hi> who before had
had but a slender Acquaintance with our <hi>Strollers,</hi> by this sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
token of Kindness had contracted so great a Friendship
with them, that they interchangeably visited and Eat toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
almost every Day. Now one Day while Monsieur the
<hi>Prior</hi> was in the <hi>Strollers</hi> Chamber, which by the by, you must
take notice was on a <hi>Friday,</hi> when they did not Act, <hi>Destiny</hi>
                     <pb n="292" facs="tcp:53808:145"/>
and Madam <hi>Star</hi> entreated Mrs. <hi>Cave</hi> to proceed with the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of her Life. She for her part was at first a little loth
to comply with their request, till at length being prevail'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and having cough'd three or four times, spit as often, and
as some will have it, gravely wip'd her Mouth with her
Handkerchief, she just began to get her self into a readiness to
speak, when the <hi>Prior</hi> was offering to begone, believing it
seems, that she might have something to deliver which she
would not have every body know. He was notwithstanding
stop'd by all the Company, and unanimously desired by them
to stay, they assuring him that they would be exceeding glad
to have him take part of their Adventures. <hi>And I dare say,</hi> quoth
<hi>Star</hi> to him, being a Woman of a ready Wit, <hi>you your self
have had a share of some in your time, for you don't by any means
seem to me to be a Person that has always worn a Cassock.</hi> These
Words confounded the <hi>Prior</hi> a little at first, but who after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
coming to himself, he frankly own'd that he had had
Adventures in his time, which possibly might not prove un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acceptable
in a <hi>Romance,</hi> in the room of many fabulous Stories
it is commonly stuffed with. To which <hi>Star</hi> briskly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd,
that she was very well satisfied they would be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining,
and therefore immediately engag'd him in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
of some of them the first opportunity they should have.
Her request he promised to gratify, and then Mrs. <hi>Cave</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
with her Account after the following manner. <q>The
Dog that frighted us prevented what I was then going to say,
and what ye shall now hear. The Proposal the Baron of
<hi>Sig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>gnac</hi> caus'd to be made to my Mother, by the good Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
that he would marry her, Afflicted her no less than it
pleased me, as I have already told you; but what encreased
her Affliction was, that she could not propose a way to herself
how she might get out of his House. To do it alone she
thought would be to little purpose, since she could not think
to get far before he would certainly send and overtake her,
and perhaps abuse her to boot. Moreover we thereby ran
a risque of losing our Baggage, which was the only thing
we had left to subsist on. At length Fortune offered us
an opportunity to escape the most plausible that could be,
which was this, This Baron who had always hitherto
been of a morose inflexible Temper, was all of a sudden
chang'd from his insensible Brutality to the sof<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>est of Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
<hi>Love,</hi> and that to so great excess, that he became
even Sick with the violence of it; nay more, Sick to
Death. At the beginning of his illness my Mother would
needs be frequently offering her Service, but she no sooner
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:53808:145"/>
came near his Bed than he always began to rave. This
my Mother perceiving, and being a Woman of no common
contrivance, she immediately apply'd herself to his Servants,
telling them that she observ'd her Daughter and she were
rather an hindrance to their Lord's recovery than a help,
and therefore desir'd of them to procure us Horses for our
selves, and a Waggon for our Baggage, and she would be
gone. This the Servants would by no means hearken to,
till at length the Curate coming, and having understood
the Baron was raving, resolv'd forthwith to deliver him
from the occasion thereof, and immediately setting about it he
soon provided us with all those necessaries we requir'd.
Next Morning we loaded the Cart with our Equipage, and
after having taken leave of the Servants, but especally of
the obliging Curate, we set forth and arriv'd at Night at
a little Town of <hi>Perigord,</hi> whose name I have forgot, but
which I nevertheless remember to be the same place from
whence a Surgeon had been fetch'd to my Mother, when she
was wounded by the Baron of <hi>Sigognac</hi>'s Servants, who took
us for Gypsies. We alighted and went to an Inn, where we
were immediately discover'd for what we were; for the
Chamber-Maid no sooner saw us but she cry'd out aloud
to her Companions, <hi>Courage my Hearts! we shall quickly have
Play acted here, since the rest of the Company are arriv'd,</hi>
This gave us to understand that there were some <hi>Strollers</hi> in
the Town, which we were heartily glad of, being in hopes that
we might have the good Fortune to join with them, and
so get our Lifelihoods, and wherein, as it happen'd, we were
not deceiv'd, for the Morning following, after we had just dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charg'd
our Waggon and Horses, two Actors who had heard
of our arrival came to see us, who acquainted us that one
of their Companions with his Wife having quitted their
Company, we if we pleas'd might have their places, which
if we would but condescend to accept of he promised him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
that they might perform wonders. My Mother who was
always very obliging accepted their proffer, and it was
agreed that she should have the chief Parts, another Woman
that was among them the second, and I such as they should
assign me, or think me capable of, for I was but then thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
or fourteen Years of Age at farthest. We continu'd act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
here about fifteen Days, this Town being no sufficient
to maintain us any longer. My Mother press'd heartily
to be gone, and to leave this Country, having a dread up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
her that assoon as the Baron were recover'd he might make
search after us, and give us some Affront. We consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:53808:146"/>
set out and rid near 40 Leagues before we pitch'd upon any
place where to Act. The Master of the Company, whose
name was <hi>Belle fleur,</hi> talk'd of Marriage to my Mother, but
which she absolutely refused, conjuring him at the same time
not to trouble himself with making love to her, since she
began to be somewhat old, and moreover had enter'd into
a Vow never to marry again. <hi>Belle-fleur</hi> hearing this my
Mothers resolution, troubled her with no more of his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses.
We rubb'd on three or four Years with success.
At length I began to grow up, and my Mother became so
crazy that she could not well Act her Parts, wherefore the
Company having a tolerable Opinion of my Performance, I
was substituted in her place. <hi>Belle-fleur</hi> who found he could
not have my Mother, demanded me of her for his Wife,
but which favour she again deny'd him, having a mind to
take the first opportunity to retire to <hi>Marseilles.</hi> But falling
afterwards sick at <hi>Troyes</hi> in <hi>Champagne,</hi> and fearing to leave
me behind her unmarried in case she should die, she Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated
to me <hi>Belle-fleurs</hi> request. Present necessity oblig'd me
to accept of the proffer, tho' he was old enough to be my Father,
yet considering that he was a very Honest Man, I was the
easier induc'd to consent to marry him. My Mother then
had the satisfaction to see me Married before she died, which
happen'd in a few Days after. I was concern'd as much as
a good Daughter ought to be, which nevertheless wore away
in a little time. I began then to apply my self altogether to
my Business again, and in a short time became with Child.
The Day of my lying down being come, I brought into the
World this Daughter <hi>Angelica</hi> you see here, who cost me so
many Tears, and is like to cost a great many more if I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
much longer in this World.</q> As she was going to proceed
with her Relation, <hi>Destiny</hi> interrupted her, telling her she
might promise herself a great deal of Satisfaction for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
instead of Disquiet, since that so rich a Gentleman as
<hi>Leander</hi> desir'd her Daughter for his Wife. Whilst Mrs. <hi>Cavi</hi>
was about to finish her Account, <hi>Leander</hi> enter'd the Room
and Saluted all the Company: He was all drest in black, and
attended by three Footmen in Black likewise, which presently
gave every body reason to conceive that his Father was
dead in earnest. The <hi>Prior</hi> left the Company and went his
way; and 'tis here that I conclude this Chapter.</p>

                  <head type="sub">The end of Mrs. Caves History.</head>
                  <p>AFter <hi>Leander</hi> had finished his Compliments upon his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival,
<hi>Destiny</hi> told him, that he must desire leave, both
to Condole him for the loss of his Father, and to Congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
him on account of the great Estate he had left him.
<hi>Leander</hi> thank'd him for both, but as for his Father's Death,
he told him, that he had long expected it with Impatience.
<hi>Nevertheless,</hi> added he, <hi>I do not intend to forsake my Profession,
which has been always so pleasant to me, however, must desire that
my appearing on the Stage may be dispenc'd with, till such time
as we are got farther off from the Place of my Nativity.</hi> This
Request was forthwith granted by all. After which, Madam
<hi>Star</hi> desir'd to know of <hi>Leander</hi> what Title she must salute him
by for the future. His answer was, That his Father's Title
was Baron of <hi>Roche-pierre,</hi> which he had a right to use if he
pleas'd, but that having resolv'd to continue among them, he
determin'd to be call'd by no other Name than that of <hi>Lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
being the same under which he had been so happy as to
be thought acceptable to his dear <hi>Angelica. This Name there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</hi>
quoth he, <hi>I am resolv'd to carry along with me to my Grave,
as well for the reason just foregoing, as to convince ye all, that I
am indispensably dispos'd to perform punctually what I promis'd to
the Company at my departure hence.</hi> At these words Embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
were renew'd, many Sighs breath'd forth, some Tears shed,
and all in general approv'd of the generous Resolution of <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi>
who approaching <hi>Angelica,</hi> bestow'd a thousand endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Protestations on her, all which she return'd with so much
Wit and good Nature, that he was more and more confirm'd
in his Resolution. I would willingly have given you the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
of their entertaining each other, but that I am not in
Love as they were. <hi>Leander</hi> told the Company farther, that
he had regulated all his Affairs, and put new Tenants into
most of his Farms, who having paid Fines amounting in all
to near 6000 <hi>Livres,</hi> he had brought the same along with him,
to the end that in case the Company wanted Money, he might
supply them. He receiv'd abundance of Thanks for this No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Offer. Then <hi>Ragotin,</hi> who had hardly appear'd in the
two foregoing Chapters, came forward, and desir'd that since
Monsieur <hi>Leander</hi> had been pleas'd to declare that he would
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:53808:147"/>
not Act whilst the Players continued in this Country, that he
might have his Parts, which he Promis'd he would perform to
all the advantage imaginable. Whereupon, <hi>Roquebrune,</hi> who
had always been his <hi>Opposite,</hi> rose up, and said, That he hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
conceiv'd, <hi>Leander</hi>'s Parts belong'd rather to him, than to
such a <hi>Whipper-Snapper</hi> as he. This word made all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
to laugh; after which <hi>Destiny</hi> acquainted the two Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didates,
that their several Merits should be considered, and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
be speedily done them. Then Mrs. <hi>Cave</hi> was desir'd to
go on with her History, but first the <hi>Prior</hi> of St. <hi>Lewis</hi> was to
be sent for, to the end that having heard hers, he might be the
better able to Relate his own. Great attention was given,
and she began again thus.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>As I remember I left off at my Lying in of <hi>Angelica.</hi> I
have already told you, the two <hi>Strollers</hi> came to desire us to
join with them, but did not tell you, that those two were
<hi>Olive</hi> and another who left ye afterwards, in whose room
came our Poet <hi>Roquebrune.</hi> But to come to the greatest of
my Misfortunes, I must tell you, that one Day as we were
Acting the <hi>Liar</hi> of <hi>Monsieur</hi> Corneille, in a certain Town of
<hi>Flanders,</hi> a Footman that had been keeping a Place for his
Lady that was not yet come, left it and went a Drunkening,
whereby another Lady got the Place. Soon after, the Lady
to whom the Place belong'd came, and finding it taken up,
very civilly told the other Lady, that that Place belong'd to
her, and therefore desir'd her to let her have it. The other
answer'd, that if she had a place there, she might take it if
she pleas'd, but for her part she would not move an Inch
from where she sat. Words thus arise, and from thence they
came to Blows. The Ladies Cussed one another heartily,
which would have signified little, had not the Men interpos'd,
who instead of parting the Fray, encreas'd it, taking to ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Party, and raising Factions against one another. This
was principally caus'd by the Ladies Relations, who both
got what Friends they could on their Side. Then was there
nothing to be heard but squeeking and clashing of Swords,
all which we only look'd upon from the Stage, till at length
my Husband who at that time Played the Part of <hi>Dorante,</hi>
seeing so many Swords drawn, and not caring to look on,
leapt in among them with his Sword drawn likewise, and
endeavour'd to appease the Tumult, when a certain Person
from one of the Parties, taking him no doubt for his Enemy,
gave him such a home Thrust, as paid him notably for his
meddling. This was given unperceiv'd by my Husband,
for had he seen it, he would no doubt have Parry'd it he
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:53808:147"/>
being not a little skill'd in Fencing. This thrust neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
pierc'd his Heart, whereof he immediately fell dead to
the Ground, which occasion'd all the Audience quickly to
shift for themselves. I then threw my self off from the
Stage into the Pit, and went to assist my wounded Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
but to my great Grief, found him stark Dead. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelica,</hi>
who then might have been about thirteen or four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
Years of Age, came down immediately to me, together
with the rest of the Company, who all joyn'd with me in
my just Complaints, for the loss of so good a Husband. I
Buried him the best I could, after that the Coroner had set
upon him, who demanded of me if I would have his War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
to take up the Murderer. I answer'd, I should be
willing to have Justice done upon him, but fear'd I had not
where withal sufficient to Prosecute him, and so declin'd it.
We quickly forsook this Town, and went a <hi>Strolling</hi> on far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
being oblig'd to Act for our Maintenance, but our
Company was now by no means good, having lost its prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Actor. I was for a long time so grieved at my Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band's
Death, that I could not give my Mind to get up my
Parts, but herein <hi>Angelica</hi> always supply'd me from her Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
when we were on any Scene together. At length we
came to a Town in <hi>Holland,</hi> where you know that you
Mr. <hi>Destiny,</hi> your Sister <hi>Star,</hi> and <hi>Rancour,</hi> came to us, and
offered to join us if we so pleas'd, and whereof we were not
a little glad, being almost quite broke before. The rest of
my Adventures have been common to us all, and whereof you
know as much already as I can pretend to tell you, and that
from <hi>Tours,</hi> where our Porter kill'd one of the <hi>Intendant</hi>'s
Officers, even to this City of <hi>Alençon,</hi> where we now are.</q>
Here Mrs. <hi>Cave</hi> ended her History, shedding a great many
Tears, which Madam <hi>Star</hi> did likewise, comforting her all
she was able, for the great Misfortunes she had undergone,
but withall remembred her, that she had the less reason to be
concern'd now, since she was so near to an Alliance with so wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
a Gentleman as <hi>Leander.</hi> Mrs. <hi>Cave</hi> sobb'd so violently
that she could not find a time to answer her, neither can I to
continue this Chapter any farther, and therefore conclude it.</p>

Adventures of Ragotin's.</head>
                  <p>THE Play went on prosperously, and one or other was
Acted every Day, with great Satisfaction to the <hi>Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi>
which consisted of the better sort, and was generally
very numerous, amongst whom nevertheless hapned no dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order,
by reason that <hi>Ragotin</hi> was kept behind the Scenes,
having no Parts yet given him, but which he grumbled at,
tho' he had been promised some when occasion serv'd. He
made his complaints almost every Day to <hi>Rancour,</hi> whom he
put a great confidence in, tho' by the way, he was one of the
very worst of Men. As he plagued him one Day above the
rest, <hi>Rancour</hi> said to him. <hi>Monsieur</hi> Ragotin, <hi>disturb your self
no more about this matter, for I must tell you, there is a great
deal of difference between the</hi> Bar <hi>and the</hi> Stage: <hi>If a Man
have not a more than ordinary Assurance, he will be easily put
out on the</hi> Stage, <hi>besides, the speaking of Verse requires no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Capacity, and is more difficult to do than you may fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.
You must observe nicely the Pointing of Verse, and when you
speak it on the Stage, run one Verse into another, that it may
seem Prose, and consequently be Natural and easie? You must not
sing it out, and stop at the</hi> Cesures, <hi>or at the end of a Verse,
as the Vulgar do, but Pronounce it always with a good Grace,
and a becoming Action. I would have you therefore,</hi> continued
he, <hi>to wait a little longer, before you come on the Stage, and in
the mean time you may Act in some private Masquerade or
Farce, to bring your hand in. You may there play the Part of a
second</hi> Zani, <hi>or</hi> Merry-<hi>Andrew, and I think we have a Habit
within, that will be very fit for you, having formerly belong'd to
a little Boy call'd</hi> Godenot, <hi>who had sometimes represented that
Person. But,</hi> added he, <hi>we must first speak to Monsieur</hi> Desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
<hi>and Madam</hi> Star <hi>about it.</hi> This they did the same Day,
and it was order'd, that next Morning <hi>Ragotin</hi> should repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
the said Person. He was instructed by <hi>Rancour</hi> in what
he was to say, who as you may have observ'd in the first Part
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:53808:148"/>
of this <hi>Romance,</hi> was altogether inclinable to <hi>Farce.</hi> The
Plot of what they play'd was an Intrigue which <hi>Rancour</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravelled
in favour of <hi>Destiny.</hi> As <hi>Rancour</hi> was preparing himself
to begin, <hi>Ragotin</hi> appeared upon the Stage, to whom the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
spoke thus. <hi>Little Boy, my pretty Godenot.</hi> quoth he, <hi>whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
art thou going in such haste?</hi> Then addressing himself to
the Company, after having chuck'd <hi>Ragotin</hi> under the Chin and
felt for his Beard, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> said he, <hi>I have always hitherto
thought that</hi> Ovid's <hi>Metamorphosis of Pismires inta Pigmies, who
had at that time War with the Cranes, was only a Fable, but now
I find it to be true, for certainly this is one of the race, or else
that little Man reviv'd, concerning whom, about Seven or Eight
Years since, there was a Song made to this affect.</hi>

                     <l>MY Mother would needs have me Wed,</l>
                     <l>But a Pigmy, alass! is the Man,</l>
                     <l>For call him a Husband who can,</l>
                     <l>That scarce takes up a Foot of the Bed,</l>
                     <l>Yet still this of him may be said,</l>
                     <l>That if he be not, he be not a Man,</l>
                     <l>He is, he is, he is, he is, he is as much as he can.</l>
                  </lg>
                  <p>At the end of every Verse <hi>Rancour</hi> turn'd and winded <hi>Ragotin</hi>
about as if he had been a Poppet, making him to appear in so
many ridiculous Postures, as made the Company to laugh
heartily. The rest of the Song I have left out as superflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to our <hi>Romance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After that <hi>Rancour</hi> had ended his Song, he shew'd <hi>Ragotin</hi>
to the Company, telling them that he was risen again from
the Dead, and to make what he said appear, he took off his
Masque and exposed him barefaced, which caused him not
only to blush for shame, but likewise to redden with Anger. He
nevertheless was fain to bear it; but however, to revenge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
he told <hi>Rancour</hi> that he was a downright Blockhead for
making his Song with such old fashion'd Rhimes, <hi>But,</hi> quoth
<hi>Rancour, I think you are a greater Blockhead for a little Man,
since you could not distinguish betwixt an old Song and a new
me, this having been made above a hundred Years ago. Also,</hi>
                     <pb n="300" facs="tcp:53808:149"/>
continu'd he, <hi>it is with Rhiming as with Language, Custom must
regulate all; for since, as Monsieur</hi> Rogula <hi>has it who reform'd
the French Tongue, we cannot give a reason why we pronounce so
and so, no more ought our Ancestors to do why they Writ after
this manner; and whereas whatever is most ancient is always
most valu'd, so ought my Song to be for the same Reason,</hi> While
<hi>Ragotin</hi> was going to answer, <hi>Destiny</hi> enter'd complaining of
the long stay his Man <hi>Rancour</hi> had made, and whom having
found in a hot dispute with <hi>Ragotin,</hi> he immediately demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of them the cause of their Dispute, but which he could
nevertheless never come to know, since they answer'd him both
at a time, and so loud that they made him stark Mad. His
Passion being thus rais'd, he thrust <hi>Ragotin</hi> against <hi>Rancour</hi>
with great Indignation, and whom <hi>Rancour</hi> return'd again a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him with like fury, till at last they had tossed him
about from one to t'other so long, that he fell down on his
Face, and afterwards march'd away on all four under the
Curtains. This the <hi>Audience</hi> all rise up to see, protesting that
this mute Action was worth all the rest of their <hi>Farce,</hi> which
they could not proceed any farther with, by reason that the
Actors had quite laughed themselves into confusion. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
this Affront, <hi>Ragotin</hi> still Solicited <hi>Rancour</hi> to
bring him in Favour with Madam <hi>Star,</hi> and the better to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
him to do it, he often treated him, which was very
welcome to <hi>Rancour,</hi> who did not scruple to feed heartily
at the little Man's cost. But as he was wounded with the
same Dart he had not the Heart to speak either for <hi>Ragotin</hi>
or himself. One Day above the rest <hi>Ragotin</hi> pressed him so
close that he found himself oblig'd to tell him, Monsieur
<hi>Ragotin, This</hi> Star <hi>no doubt is of the nature of those in the
Firmament, which the</hi> Astrologers <hi>name wandring, for I have no
sooner at any time begun to open your Passion to her, but she
twinkles and leaves me without an Answer. Yet how should she
Answer me,</hi> quoth he, <hi>if she will not hear me. But I believe I
have discovered the occasion of her Indifference,</hi> proceeded he,
<hi>and which no question may surprize you; but a Man that has a
mind to be satisfied in any thing must be prepar'd against all
Events. This Monsieur</hi> Destiny, <hi>whom she calls her Brother, I
fancy not to be at all so, for I surpriz'd them the other Day Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ressing
after that manner as such near Relations are not wont to
do, and therefore I am rather enclinable to believe that he is her
Gallant, and I am more deceiv'd than ordinary, if on the same
Day that</hi> Leander <hi>and</hi> Angelica <hi>Marry they do not Marry too:
Otherwise I should think her the most indiscreet Woman in the
World,</hi> added he, <hi>to slight your generous proffer: You that are a
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:53808:149"/>
Man of Quality and Merit, without taking notice of your grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Mien. I tell you this,</hi> continued he, <hi>that you may have the
more reason to remove her from your Heart, since you will not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
fail to torment your self like one of the damn'd.</hi> The
little Man, both Poet and Advocate, was so confounded at
this discourse, that he had nothing left to say, but immediately
quitted <hi>Rancour,</hi> shaking his Head and crying after his wonted
manner, <hi>Serviteur, Serviteur,</hi> &amp;c. Afterwards <hi>Ragotin</hi> resolv'd
with himself to go to <hi>Beaumont le Vicomté,</hi> a little Town about
five Leagues distant from <hi>Alencon,</hi> where there was a Market
kept every <hi>Monday.</hi> The reason of his going he told the
Company was to receive a certain Sum of Money that was
owing him in that Town by a Merchant. <hi>But how will you
do to go,</hi> quoth <hi>Rancour</hi> to him, <hi>since your Horse has been lately
prick'd in Shooing, and is lame? he will never be able to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
you so far.</hi> 
                     <q>It may be not, <hi>answered</hi> Ragotin, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I'll hire one that shall, and if I cannot meet with one to
my purpose, I can at last walk on Foot, it is not so far. I
don't question, <hi>added he,</hi> but I shall meet with some Company
that will go from hence.</q> He sought after, but could not
find a Hackney to be let, which induc'd him to enquire of a
Pedler that lived next Door to his Lodging <hi>if he were not
disposed to go,</hi> and finding he was, he desir'd the favour of him
for a Companion, which the Pedler agreed to be, in case that
he would be gone by one a Clock in the Morning, when the
Moon would be just up, which he with little difficulty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to. Now a little before they set out, a poor Nail-Smith
was gone towards the said Market to dispose of his Nails,
which he was accustom'd to make every Week ready for <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days</hi>
on purpose. This Nail-Smith being upon the Road on
Foot, with his Wallet upon his Back, and hearing no noise
of Travellers, either before or behind him, thought that he
had been got out too early; besides, he was a little affraid
when he consider'd he was to pass under several Gibbets
where Mens quarters hung, which obliged him to step aside
out of the Road, and to go lye down upon a Bank, where he
fell asleep. Some little time after <hi>Ragotin</hi> and the Pedler came
by, but who said not a Word to each other, the little Man's
thoughts being wholly taken up with Reflections on what <hi>Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour</hi>
had told him. When they came near to the Gibbets,
<hi>Ragotin</hi> ask'd the Pedler if he would not count the Persons
that were Hang'd. The Pedler answered <hi>with all his Heart.</hi>
Then they went forwards into the middle of them, and began
to Count, but at length having met with one that was dropt
down, and was very stiff and dry, <hi>Ragotin</hi> who had always
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:53808:150"/>
thoughts worthy of himself, ask'd his Companion to assist
to help him up, and set him against one of the Posts, the which
they easily perform'd by help of their Staves. This done,
they counted fourteen Hang'd, besides this last, and so went
on on their Journey. They had not gone far, before <hi>Ragotin</hi>
had a Maggot come in his Head, to turn about and call to
the dead Person to come after him, which he did in these<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
Words; <hi>So ho! you, will you come along with us?</hi> The Nail-Smith,
who it seems did not sleep very sound, hearing of
this, rise up presently from his Post, thinking some Fellow
Travelers had desired his Company, and cryed, <hi>With all my
Heart, I come, I come,</hi> and immediately began to follow them.
The Pedler and <hi>Ragotin</hi> thinking verily it had been the dead
Corps that came towards them, ran away as hard as they cou'd
drive, whereat the Nail-Smith began to fun likewise, crying
all the way, <hi>Stay, stay, I come, I come.</hi> As the Nail-smith
ran, his Nails that he had on his Back made a great noise,
which inclin'd <hi>Ragotin</hi> and the Pedler the more to believe
that it was the Corps that they had set up against the Gib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
or else the Ghost of some other Person that drag'd Chains
after him; for the Vulgar are of Opinion that there is never
a Ghost that appears, but he has a Chain fastned to him.
This belief made them to tremble so much that they could not
run any farther, and their Legs not being able to support
them longer, they dropt down. This gave the Nail-smith
opportunity to come up with them, whom they at first were
miserably afrighted at, but he having bid them good Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
and telling them they had given him a great deal of
Trouble to overtake them, they began to come to themselves,
and saw he was no Ghost. They then joined Companies,
and continu'd their Journey prosperously to <hi>Beaumont,</hi> where
<hi>Ragotin</hi> did what he had to do, and return'd next Morning
to <hi>Alençon,</hi> where he found his Friends just risen from Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
to whom having related the Story of his Adventure, they
Laugh'd so heartily, that they were almost ready to burst.
The Women for their parts were so extremely tickled, that
they Haw-haw'd out so loud, that they were heard cross the
way, and which 'tis probable they would have continu'd much
longer, had they not been interrupted by the Arrival of a
Coach full of Country Gentry. This Coach belonged to one
Monsieur <hi>de la Fresnay,</hi> who was about to Marry his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and was come to <hi>Alençon</hi> to entreat the Strollers to come
and Act a Play at her Wedding. This Lady, who was none
of the Wisest of her Sex, desired them that they would Act
the <hi>Sylvius</hi> of <hi>Mairet.</hi> This the Actresses were hardly able to
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:53808:150"/>
forbear laughing at, telling her that if her Ladyship would
have that, she must procure them a Book, for they had not
one by them; the Lady answered, she would lend them one,
adding withal, that she had all the Pastorals Bound up toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in one Volume, <hi>viz.</hi> those of <hi>Raçan,</hi> being <hi>the Fair Fisher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman,
the Love-Hater, Plocidon, the Mercer,</hi> &amp;c. together
with several others whose Titles she had forgot. <hi>Such Plays
as these,</hi> quoth she to them, <hi>are proper for you Strollers that
Act always in the Country, and cannot perhaps go to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
of such sumptuous Habits, as the Death of</hi> Cinna, Hera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius,
Rodogune, <hi>and the like would require. Moreover, the
Verse in Pastorals savours not so much of Bombast, as that of Heroick
Poems. Besides, Pastorals are of a nature more conformable to the
Simplicity of our first Parents, who wore nothing but Fig-leaves
even after they had sinned.</hi> Her Father and Mother were all
the while harkening to their Daughters Discourse with great
attention and wonder, imagining that the greatest Orators of
the Kingdom could not be able to utter any thing beyond
it. After this, the <hi>Strollers</hi> desir'd time to prepare themselves,
and had eight Days given them. The Company parted after
Dinner, just as the <hi>Prior</hi> of St. <hi>Lewis</hi> hapned to come in.
Madam <hi>Star</hi> told him he had done well to come, having
sav'd <hi>Olive</hi> the trouble of looking after him. The Actresses
seated themselves upon the Bed, and the Actors in Chairs.
The Door was shut, and the Porter had Orders to send a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
every Body that came to speak with them. After silence
was proclaim'd, the <hi>Prior</hi> began his History as you may find
in the following Chapter, if you'll take the pains but to read
it.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="10" type="chapter">
                  <head>CHAP. X.</head>
                  <head type="sub">The History of the Prior of St. Lewis, and the
Arrival of Monsieur Verville.</head>
                  <p>THE <hi>beginning of this History,</hi> quoth the Prior, <hi>cannot but be a
little tedious, since it consists chiefly of Genealogy. Nevertheless,
this sort of begining is necessary too to introduce a perfect under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
of the matter in Dispute. I shall not endeavour to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guize
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:53808:151"/>
my Condition, since I am in my own Country. In another
it may be I might have pass'd for what I really was not, which
nevertheless I have never yet done. I have always been very sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
in this Point.</hi> 
                     <q>I am then, a Native of this City, the
Wives of my two great Grand-fathers were Gentlewomen,
and had a <hi>de</hi> tackt to their Sir-names. But as you know,
the eldest Sons going away with the greatest part of the
Estate, leave but little for the younger Children, who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to Custom, are either oblig'd to go into Orders,
or else to Marry some inferiour Person or other, suitable to
their Condition, providing she be Rich and Honest, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suant
to the Proverb which has been a long time currant
in this Country; <hi>More Money and less Honour.</hi> So that
my two Grand-mothers were Marry'd to two rich Trades<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
the one a Woolen-draper, and the other a Linnen-draper.
My Father's Father had four Sons, whereof my Father
was not the eldest. My Mothers Father had two Sons
and two Daughters, whereof she was one, and Marryed to
the second Son of the Woolen-draper, who had left off his
Trade to follow Petty-fogging, whereby he fool'd away
most of his Estate, which was the Reason that he left me
but little. My Father had formerly thriv'd very much by
his Trade, and Marryed a very rich Woman for his first
Wife, who dyed without Children. He was pretty well
advanc'd in Years when he Marryed my Mother, which
she consented to rather out of Duty than Inclination, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that there was more of Aversion on her side than
Love, which no doubt was the reason that they were thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
Years Marryed before they had the least hopes of having
any Children. At last my Mother was big, and when the time
of her Lying-in was come, she brought me into the World with
a great deal of Pain, having been four full Days in Labour.
My Father, who was at that time employ'd in prosecuting
a Man that had killed his Brother, was overjoy'd, when at
his return the Women gave him joy of a Son. He treated
them all as well as he could, and made some of them drunk,
having given them strong White-wine, on the Lees instead
of Perry, which he has many a time after told me, and
whereat we have laughed heartily. Two Days after my
Birth I was Baptised. My Name signifies little to be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd.
I had for Godfather the Lord of the Place, a very
rich Man, and my Father's Neighbour, who having under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
by the Lady, his Wife, that my Mother was with Child,
after so many Years Marriage, desired he might hold what
God sent her to the Font. What he desired was readily grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:53808:151"/>
my Mother having no more Children than me, bred me
with all the care imaginable, and perhaps a little too nicely
for one of her Quality. As I came to grow up it was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
I would be no Fool, which occasion'd me to be mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
belov'd by every body, especially by my Godfather, who
had but one only Daughter, that had been married to a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
a Relation of my Mothers. She had two Sons one
elder by a year than I, and one younger by a Year, but both
who were as backward in Parts as I were forward, which
occasion'd my Godfather to send for me always when he had
any of the better sort of Company, (which you must know
he often had, being accustomed to treat all the Princes and
great Lords that passed by our Town) to divert them, which
by Dancing, Singing and Pratling I did. For this purpose I
was always kept in a better Garb than ordinary, and I had sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
made my Fortune with him had not Death taken him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
suddenly as he was on a Journey to <hi>Paris.</hi> I neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
was not so sensible then of his Death as I have been since.
My Mother sent me to Study, and I profited extremely;
but when she understood my Inclinations ran towards the
Church, she took me from the College and brought me into
the World, notwithstanding her Vow to devote her first-fruits
to God, if he should please to give her any. She prov'd
quite contrary to other Mothers who do all they can to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
their Childrens falling into ill Courses, for she was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
feeding me with Money, Sundays and Holy days
especially, to go a Gaming, or to the Tavern. Nevertheless
having some discretion of my own, all my Liberties and Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
amounted only to making merry sometimes with my Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.
I had contracted a more than ordinary Friendship with
a young Lad, Son to a certain Officer belonging to <hi>Lewis</hi>
XIII's Queen-<hi>Dowager,</hi> who had likewise two Daughters.
He lived in that fine Park, which as you may have heard
was one of the greatest Delights of the ancient Dukes of
<hi>Alençon.</hi> His House there had been given him by the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
Queen <hi>Dowager,</hi> his Royal Mistress, who had an Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
upon that Dutchy. We led a pleasant Life in this
Park, but that, still like Children, never thinking of what
was to come. This Officer of the Queens was called Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>du Fresne,</hi> who had a Brother an Officer likewise, who
belong'd to the King. This Brother requir'd <hi>du Fresne</hi> to
send his Son to him, which he could by no means refuse to do.
Before his Son went for the Court he came to take leave of me,
and I must own the parting with him raised the first Grief
that ever I felt. We lamented our Separation reciprocally,
but I had much greater Reason two Months after, when I
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:53808:152"/>
heard from his Mother the News of his Death. I shew'd
as much concern for the loss of him as I was capable of
shewing, and went immediately to join with his Sisters in their
Grief for him, which was exceeding great. But as Time
lessens all things, when this sad remembrance was a little over,
Madam <hi>du Fresne</hi> came and desired my Mother that I might
teach her younger Daughter a little to write, whose name was
Mademoiselle <hi>du Lys,</hi> to distinguish her from her elder Sister,
who bore the Name of the Family. The reason of her trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
me, she said, was because her Writing-Master had been
newly gone, and tho' there were several others in the Town,
yet none would teach abroad, and truly she thought her
Daughters quality too great to go to School. She excused
her self very much for this Liberty she had taken, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
intimated to my Mother that this Familiarity might end
in something more important, meaning a Marriage, which
was soon after agreed on privately between my Mother and
her. My Mother had no sooner proposed this Employment
to me but I readily accepted it, and went immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Dinner to wait on my Schollar, finding a secret Spring
within, that moved me more than ordinary, tho' I knew
not at that time what it was. I had not been above eight
Days in this Exercise, but the young Lady my Scholar, who
was much handsomer than her Sister, began to be very Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
with me, and call'd me in Raillery her little Master. It
was then that I began to find something in my Heart that I
had been but little acquainted with before, and the young
Lady, for ought I could perceive by her, felt the same. We
were from that time inseparable, and were never so well
pleased as when we were left alone together, which happen'd
not seldom. This sort of Conversation lasted about six Months
before we declar'd the Sentiments of our Hearts, but nevertheless
our Eyes spoke sufficiently all the while. One Day I had a
mind to try to make a Copy of Verses in her Praise, to see
how she would receive them; but having never made an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of that Nature before, I was affraid I should not suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed.
Notwithstanding I immediately set my self about
reading the best Romance-Writers and Poets I could find, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
rejected those of the <hi>Melesines, Robert</hi> the Devil, <hi>Aymons
Four Sons,</hi> the fair <hi>Maguelonne, Iohn</hi> of <hi>Paris,</hi> &amp;c. which are
trifling Compositions, and only fit for Children to read. At
last looking by Chance into <hi>Marot</hi>'s Works, I met with a
Roundelay very proper for my purpose. This I immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Transcribed Word for Word, and which is as follows.

                     <q>I gave her these Verses, which she read with a great deal
of Pleasure, as I could perceive by her Countenance. After
having read them she thrust them into her Bosom, whence
they not long after fell upon the Ground, and were taken
up by her elder Sister, contrary to her Knowledge, but which
she aftervvards came to knovv, by means of a Lackey. She
thereupon ask'd her Sister for them, and perceiving she made
some difficulty to let her have them, she flevv into a great
Passion, and vvent and complained to her Mother, vvho forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvith
order'd her Sister to give them her, vvhich she presently
did. This sort of proceeding gave me a great deal of hopes,

our Fancies, my Father and Mother being pretty vvell ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd
in Years, determin'd to marry me, and one Day
made me acquainted vvith their Intentions. My Mother
discover'd to my Father the Project she had laid with Madam
<hi>du Fresne,</hi> but he being a Man of more Sense than ordinary,
absolutely rejected it, saying that that young Ladies Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
was too great for me, and besides, that she had too little
Money to support it, well knowing that she would expect to
be maintained according to it. But as I was the only Son of my
Father, who was tolerably Rich, as likewise Heir to an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
who had no Children, by the Custom of <hi>Normandy,</hi> many
Families look'd upon me as worthy of their Alliance, and
consequently made me stand Godfather to divers Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren,
with several young Ladies of the best Quality in our
Neighbourhood, those being the common means to promote
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:53808:153"/>
Marriages, which nevertheless had no effect upon me,
having been before entirely devoted to my dear <hi>du Lys.</hi>
I was notwithstanding so continually Persecuted by my Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
to Marry some other, that to avoid their Importunities,
I resolv'd to go to the Wars, altho' I was not then above
16 or 17 Years of Age. New Levies being made in this City
to go to <hi>Denmark,</hi> under the Command of the Count of
<hi>Montgomery.</hi> I Listed my self privately with three others,
younger Brothers my Neighbours. We set out in pretty
good Equipage, and my Father and Mother were so extremely
concern'd, that the latter was almost like to die with Grief.
How <hi>du Lys</hi> bore my so sudden Departure, I could not tell
as then, but which I understood afterwards from her self.
We Embark'd at <hi>Havre-de Grace,</hi> and Sail'd very success<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
till we came within sight of the <hi>Sound,</hi> but then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rose
so furious a Tempest, that the like was scarce ever known
before. Our Ships were soon separated from each other,
and that which I was in, Commanded by the Count him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
was driven very luckily to the Mouth of the <hi>Thames,</hi>
where by the help of a Reflux we quickly got up to <hi>London,</hi>
the Capital City of <hi>England.</hi> There we staid about 6 Weeks,
during which time I had opportunity to survey the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities
of that superbe City, and above all, the shining Court
of its King, who was then <hi>Charles,</hi> I. of that Name. The
Count of <hi>Montgomery</hi> returned afterwards to his Seat <hi>Port-Orson</hi>
in <hi>Normandy,</hi> whither I did not care to go, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
desir'd of him to permit me to go for <hi>Paris,</hi> which
he did. I Embark'd then on board a Vessel bound for
<hi>Roan,</hi> where I not long after arriv'd safe, and from thence
went in a Boat up to <hi>Paris.</hi> There met with a near

of <hi>Calais,</hi> who had his Head struck off there. This rais'd
a Terrour in all the others, insomuch that they su'd to his
Majesty for Peace, which being granted them, the King
return'd to <hi>Paris.</hi> In our way we stopt at <hi>Mans,</hi> where
my Father came to see me, old as he was, having been
before acquainted by my Cousen, that I was in the King's
<hi>Guards,</hi> and beg'd of my Captain to Discharge me, which
he with some difficulty, or rather, for some consideration
did. We then return'd to this City, where it was agreed,
that the only way to keep me at home, was to Marry me,
A Surgeon's Wife that was Neighbour to a Cousen Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of mine, hearing this, brought along with her the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-Baily's
Daughter, of a Town about three Leagues off,
under pretence of Devotion, being Lent-time, but her true
Reason was, to intrap me if possible. Having seen her but
once, I was desir'd to do it again at my Cousen's House,
which I did, and after about an Hours Conversation with
her, she went her way, when all the Company told me,
that she was a Mistriss for me, to which I bluntly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd,
that I did not like her. My reason was not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
she was not Rich and Handsome, being both in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
but because all the Beauty in the World could have
no power upon me, as long as my dear <hi>du Lys</hi> was in
my Thoughts. I had an Uncle, my Mothers Brother, of a
severe Temper, who coming one Night to our House, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
having rally'd me extremely for the slights I had put
upon the Under-Baily's Daughter, told me I must resolve
to go and Visit her at her own House, in the <hi>Easter</hi> Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days,
there being those of a much greater Quality than I,
who would be proud of such a Match. I answer'd nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
one way nor other, but when the Holy-days came, I
was forc'd to go thither with my said Cousen the Surge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on's
Wife, and a Son of hers. When we came, we were
very Courteously received and treated for three Days to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.
We were also carryed to all the said Under-Bai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly's
Farms, at every one of which we were handsomely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained.
We went likewise to a large Village, about a
League off this Gentleman's House, to pay a Visit to the
Curate of the Place, who was a Brother to this Ladies
Mother, and who gave us a very civil Reception. At last
we returned home as we came, that is, as to what concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
me, as little in Love as before. It was nevertheless re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd,
that in a Fortnights time our Marriage should be
concluded, which term being expir'd. I was compell'd to
return to the Baily's House, together with three Cousin
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:53808:154"/>
Germans, two Advocates, and an Attorney of this Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but as good Luck would have it, they could agree up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
nothing, wherefore the Business was put off till <hi>May</hi>
next. But that Saying is certainly true. <hi>That Man pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses,
and God disposes;</hi> For a little before the said propos'd
Time, my Mother fell sick, and my Father 4 Days after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
both whose Maladies ended in Death, the former
dying on <hi>Tuesday,</hi> and the latter on the <hi>Thursday</hi> following.
Altho' I Was very sick my self, yet I made shift to go Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit
my aforesaid severe Uncle, who was extremely ill like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
and who dyed in less than a Fortnights time. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
after all this, the <hi>Baily</hi>'s Daughter was propos'd to me
a-new, but which I would hear nothing of, having now no
Parents left to force me. My Heart was altogether in the
aforesaid Park, where I frequently walked, but never half
so often as I had done in Imagination. One Morning when
I thought no body had been stirring in the Sieur <hi>du Fres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne</hi>'s
House, I walk'd leisurely before it, and was not a
little surpriz'd, when I saw <hi>du Lys</hi> Singing at the Window
an old Song, which had for its upholding,
<q>Ah! Why is he from me, the Man that I love?</q>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>This oblig'd me to draw nearer to her, and to make her
a very low Bow, which I accompanyed with this or the
like Expression.</q> 
                     <hi>I could wish with all my Heart Madam,
that you had the satisfaction you so much desire, and were it in
my Power to contribute towards it, I would always do it, with
as servent a Passion, as I have ever shew'd to approve my self
your most humble Servant.</hi> 
                     <q>She returned my Salutation,
answered me not a Word, but continuing to Sing on, she
chang'd the Burden of her Song to,
<q>Ha! see him before me, the Man that I love.</q>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>You may imagine, this was not heard by one that was
Deaf, and having been a little in the Wars, I had Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
enough to reply, tho' not in Verse. <hi>I should have just
Reason to believe you Sincere, Madam, If you would but oblige me
so far, as to open the Door.</hi> At the same time she call'd to
the Lackey, spoken of before, and bid him to open the
Door to me. I went in, and was receiv'd not only by her, but
likewise by her Father and Mother, and elder Sister, with all
the Civility and good Will imaginable. Her Mother ask'd
me why I was so great a Stranger, and why they had not
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:53808:154"/>
seen me as frequently as they were wont? My Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>she told me,</hi> was no just excuse, since I must be allow'd
to divert my self now as well as before, and in a Word,
she gave me to understand that I should always be extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
welcome to her House. My Answer was only to shew
the little Merit I had to pretend to, and which I express'd
in some few ill-order'd Words as I have done before. But
at length all concluded with a Breakfast of Milk, which
you know in this Country passes for a good Treat.</q>
                     <hi>And which is notwithstanding none of the worst, Sir,</hi> quoth
Madam <hi>Star,</hi> But pray go on. <q>When I was taking
leave to be gone, the Mother ask'd me if I would not
give my self the trouble to accompany her and her
Daughter to see an old Relation of theirs that liv'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
two Leagues off, I answer'd, that she did me wrong to
ask me the Question, when an absolute Command would have
been much more obliging to me. The Journey was pitch'd
upon for next Day. The time came, and the Mother got up
upon a little Mule they had in the House, the elder Sister
rid her Fathers Horse, and I carried behind me my dear
<hi>du Lys.</hi> What discourse we had upon the Road I'll give
you leave to guess, for as for my part I have forgot it. All
that I am able to tell you is, that <hi>du Lys</hi> and I often stole
from the Company, and went to recreate our selves in an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joining
Grove, which had a little River that ran through the
midst of it, upon whose Banks we had the pleasure both to
hear the warbling of the Birds, and the purling of the Stream,
to which we added our mutual Endearments, and many
innocent Caresses which passed between us. It was there that
we enter'd into a Resolution to divert our selves considerably
at the approaching <hi>Carnevale.</hi> Some time after this Journey,
while I was making of Syder in the Suburbs that are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>la Barre,</hi> and which join to <hi>du Lys</hi>'s Father's Park, she
came running to me, whereby I presently guessed that she had
something more than ordinary to tell me. After having
chid me a little for finding me in that Condition, she took
me aside and told me that the Gentleman whose Daughter
was at Monsieur <hi>de Planche-Planete</hi>'s Brother-in-Laws, had
brought another Gentlem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and whereof she though <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> to get an opportunity to come and

                        </gap> I had rather you should find out some

                        </gap>. To this I reply'd,</hi> Go you and make
much of him, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

<pb n="312" facs="tcp:53808:155"/>
                     <q>She then left me extremely well pleased, and I immediately
put off my Syder to my Servants management, and went di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
home; where taking a clean Shirt, and another suit of
Clothes, I hasted to find out my Companions, for you must know
there were 15 of us young Fellows, who had each a Mistress
and were all jointly engag'd to cut any Man's Throat that
should offer but to interfere with either. I acquainted them
with what I have already told you, and all concluded that
this Gallant, who was a Gentleman of <hi>Lower-Maine,</hi> must
be found out and be forc'd to return from whence he came.
We went then forthwith to his Lodging, where he was at
Supper with the other Gentleman his Introducer. We did
not stick to tell him down right that he must speedily be
gone, and that there was nothing to be got for him in that
Country. Then the Introducer reply'd and told us, that we
did not know what they were come about, and that when
we did, we would not be so much concern'd at it.</q> Then I
stept up, and clapping my Hand to my Sword, said, <hi>If I
have her Heart, I have it, and if you do not quit her this Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute,
I'll quickly send your Souls a Wool-gathering.</hi> 
                     <q>One of
them reply'd, that the contest was not equal, and that if
I were alone I durst not have said so much.</q> To which I
answer'd, <hi>You are two, and here is a Gentleman and I,</hi> taking one
of my Comrades, <hi>that will presently go and dispute the matter with
you farther.</hi> 
                     <q>The Gentlemen accepted the Challenge, and we
were all going out when the Master of the House, and a
Son of his, prevented us, persuading the Gentlemen that their
best way was to be gone, and not to stand disputing with
us, whom they were positive they would get nothing by.
They took their Advice, and we never heard a Word of
them after. Next Morning I went to wait on my dear
<hi>du Lys,</hi> telling her all that had passed, wherewith she seem'd
very well satisfied, and gave me abundance of Thanks for
delivering her from her Lover. The Winter now approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
the Nights began to be long, and which we passed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
at <hi>Questions and Commands,</hi> and such like sorts of Plays,
but which being every Night repeated at length grew te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious,
and therefore I determin'd to give a Ball. I confer'd
with <hi>du Lys,</hi> about it, and she consented to it; I ask'd her
Fathers leave, and he granted it me. The following Sunday
we Danc'd all Day, and which we continued to do often,
till at length there came so many People that <hi>du Lys</hi> desir'd
me to give it over, and think o<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> some other Diversion.
We then resolv'd to get up a Comedy and Act it, which
we not long after did accordingly.</q> Here Madam <hi>Star</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terupted
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:53808:155"/>
the Prior, saying, <hi>Sir, since you are upon Comedy, pray
give me leave to ask you if this History of yours be much longer,
for it begins to grow late, and Supper time approaches.</hi> 
                     <q>Ah!
Madam, <hi>quoth the</hi> Prior, there is twice as much of it to come
yet.</q> Then it was thought necessary to put it off to another
time, that the Actors might have time to dress for the Play,
and had it not been for which reason, Monsieur <hi>Vervilles</hi> arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val
would have interrupted it, who got easily into the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
by reason that the Porter was asleep. His coming sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd
the Company extremely. He very courteously embrac'd
them all, and chiefly Monsieur <hi>Destiny,</hi> whom he hugged close<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
more than once. Afterwards he began to tell them the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
of his Journey, which you shall have in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                  <p>THE <hi>Prior</hi> of St. <hi>Lewis</hi> would have been gone but <hi>Destiny</hi>
stopt him, telling him that Supper would be ready

they had entreated to Sup vvith them. The Hostess vvas called
up and order'd to get something extraordinary. Clean Linnen

to knovv of <hi>Verville</hi> the occasion of his coming into those

<hi>Saldaigne's</hi> Death, vvhich his Sisters lamented
no less than he, but by reason of a business of importance,
vvhich he had to Negotiate at <hi>Rennes</hi> in <hi>Britany,</hi> so that being

him heartily for the Honour he had done him, and aftervvards
inform'd him of all the ill Designs that <hi>Saldaigne,</hi> had had
against him, vvhich you may have seen in the VI Chapter
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:53808:156"/>
of this Third Part, as likewise with the manner of his Death.
<hi>Verville</hi> shrug'd up his Shoulders at this Relation, saying, <hi>he
had deservedly met with what he so industriously sought after.</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Supper <hi>Verville</hi> took Acquaintance with the <hi>Prior,</hi> whom
<hi>Destiny</hi> recommended to him for a very worthy Gentleman.
Having sat up a little with them the <hi>Prior</hi> retir'd, when <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville</hi>
took <hi>Destiny</hi> aside and demanded of him what made
<hi>Leander</hi> in Mourning, and how he came to have so many
Lackeys after him all in Black likewise. He satisfied him
quickly in his Demands, and moreover acquainted him that
he was return'd with a design to Marry Madam <hi>Angelica. And
you,</hi> quoth <hi>Verville, When do you design to Marry? Methinks
it is high time to let the World know who you are, which cannot
be done without a Marriage,</hi> adding withal, that if his Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
did not call him suddenly away, he would stay to see
both his and <hi>Leander</hi>'s Marriage Solemniz'd. <hi>Destiny</hi> answer'd
it was necessary for him to know Madam <hi>Star</hi>'s Mind before
he declared himself. Hereupon <hi>Star</hi> was presently called, and
the Marriage proposed to her, whereto she readily answer'd,
that she ever would be rul'd by the advice of her Friends.
At last it was agreed that when <hi>Verville</hi> had funish'd his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
at <hi>Rennes,</hi> he should return by <hi>Alençon,</hi> and then all
matters should be concluded. The same was concluded between
the Company and Mrs <hi>Cave</hi> concerning her Daughters Match
with <hi>Leander.</hi> Then <hi>Verville</hi> took his leave of the good Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
and went to Bed. Next Morning he set forth for <hi>Britany</hi>
betimes, and arriv'd not long after at <hi>Rennes,</hi> where he immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
went to wait on Monsieur <hi>de la Garrouffiere,</hi> who after
the accustom'd Compliments had passed between them, told
him there was a company of <hi>Strollers</hi> in that Town, one of
which had a great resemblance of Mrs. <hi>Cave.</hi> This caused
him to go next Day to the Play, where having seen the Person
mention'd to him, he was forthwith inclin'd to believe that he
must needs be a Relation of <hi>Caves,</hi> he was so like her. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Play was over he went upon the Stage, and enquir'd of
him what Country he was of, whence he came, how long he
had been a Player, and by what means he got into the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany?
To all which Questions he answer'd so directly that it
was no hard matter for <hi>Verville</hi> to find that he was Mrs. <hi>Caves</hi>
Brother, who had been lost when his Father was killed at
<hi>Perigord</hi> by the Baron of <hi>Sigognac</hi>'s Page. This he frankly
own'd, adding withall, that he had never been able to meet
with his Sister since. Then <hi>Verville</hi> let him know that she
was at that time in a Company of <hi>Strollers</hi> at <hi>Alençon;</hi> that
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:53808:156"/>
she had met with many Misfortunes, but that now she was
like to have large amends made her by a Gentleman of 12000
Livres a Year, being to be suddenly Married to an only
Daughter of hers, and farther, that this Gentleman was now
along with them, and acted among them. He also acquainted
him that the Marriage was to be Consummated at his return to
<hi>Alençon,</hi> and that it was very necessary for him to go along
with him, both to see his Sister, and to wish his Niece Joy.
The <hi>Stroller</hi> was extremely pleased at this News, and promis'd
to be going with him assoon as he pleas'd, but we must leave
him for a while, packing up his Awls, and return before him
to <hi>Alençon.</hi> The <hi>Prior</hi> of St. <hi>Lewis</hi> came, the same Day that
<hi>Verville</hi> went away, to acquaint the <hi>Strollers</hi> that the Bishop of
<hi>Sées</hi> had sent to speak with him, to Comunicate some matter
of Importance to him, and that he was very sorry that he had
not then leisure to perform his promise to them, but that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
there would be no time lost, for while he was at <hi>Sées</hi> they
might go to <hi>Fresnaye</hi> to act <hi>Sylvia</hi> at the Wedding of the Lords

the Forest of <hi>Persaine,</hi> which was in the Province of
<hi>Maine.</hi> They had not gone above a Mile into this Forest,
before <hi>Ragotin</hi> call'd out to the Coach-man to stop, alleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that he saw a Troop of Horse-men coming towards them.
It was not thought necessary to stop, but every one never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless
would be upon his Guard. When he came near the
Horsemen, <hi>Ragotin</hi> gave notice that it was <hi>la Rappiniere</hi> with his
Archers. Hereat Madam <hi>Star</hi> began immediately to look Pale,
which <hi>Destiny</hi> perceiving, told her she had no reason to fear any
Insult being offer'd to her there, by reason that <hi>la Rappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niere</hi>
would never pretend to any such thing, in the Presence
both of his <hi>Archers</hi> and Monsieur <hi>de la Fresnayes</hi> Servants,
whose House they were also near. <hi>La Rappiniere</hi> knew well
that it was the <hi>Strolling</hi>-Company that were coming towards
him, and therefore advancing to the Coach-side with his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed
Impudence he saluted the Actresses, but to whom
he made very coarse Compliments, which they returned
cold enough to have put any one out of Countenance, that
had not so much Brass in his Forehead as <hi>la Rappiniere</hi> had.
He told them that he was looking after Robbers that had
robb'd some Trades-men near <hi>Balon,</hi> and that he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
they were coming that way. Whilst he was thus
talking to the <hi>Strollers,</hi> one of the <hi>Archer</hi>'s Horses that was
a little wanton, leapt upon <hi>Ragotin</hi>'s Horse's Neck, which
he going backward to avoid, hapned among a parcel of dead
Trees, whereof one pointing directly towards him, took him
under his Wastcoat, and hung him from his Saddle, which
he being willing to disengage himself from, spurr'd his Horse
lustily, and thereby remain'd like a Scare-crow truss'd up in
the Air, for his Horse no sooner felt his Favours than he left
him, crying that he was kill'd, run thro' and I know not what.
The Standers-by laugh'd so heartily to see him hanging in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>
Posture, that they had no manner of regard to assisting of him.
Indeed they call'd once or twice to the Foot-men to unloose him
but they ran away on the other side laughing. In the mean time
his Horse was run quite away, and would not suffer himself to be
stopt. At length, after every body had laugh'd their Belly full
the Coach-man, who was a strong lusty Fellow, step<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="317" facs="tcp:53808:157"/>
to keep the Wound from festering, which they immediately
did. They afterwards put him into the Coach in <hi>Olives</hi>
room, who came out. Whilst this pass'd, the Foot-men and
<hi>Olive</hi> went after his Horse that would not be stopt, and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
his being got a great way, brought him back
again to his Master. This done, <hi>la Rappiniere</hi> left the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
and they continu'd onwards of their Journey towards
the Gentleman's House, where they soon after arriv'd, and
sent thence for a Surgeon, who they privately instructed what
he was to do. He seem'd to Probe the imaginary Wound
that <hi>Ragotin</hi> had, whom they had put to Bed. He likewise
pretended to Tent it, and afterwards Bound it up, telling
his Patient, that if it had been never so little on the other
side, he had been no longer a Man of this World. He then
order'd him a strict Diet, and so left him to his repose. The
little Man was so imaginarily Afflicted at this Accident, that
he could not believe but he was desperately wounded. He
therefore did not think fit to rise to assist at the <hi>Ball</hi> vvhich
vvas given after Supper. This <hi>Ball</hi> vvas furnisht vvith Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick
from <hi>Mans,</hi> the Musicians of <hi>Alençon</hi> being gone to a
Wedding at <hi>Argenton.</hi> Several Country-dances vvent about,
and the <hi>Strollers</hi> Danc'd divers <hi>French</hi> ones. <hi>Destiny</hi> and <hi>Star</hi>
perform'd a <hi>Saraband</hi> together, vvhich vvas admir'd by all the
Company, consisting as vvell of Country Gentry as Peasants.
the next Day the <hi>Strollers</hi> play'd the Pastoral vvhich the Bride
had desir'd. <hi>Ragotin</hi> caus'd himself to be carry'd to the sight
on't in a Chair, vvith his Night-cap on. Aftervvards they
made good Cheer, and the next Morning after Breakfast,
having been vvell paid, they set out for <hi>Alençon</hi> again. As
soon as the Coach vvas brought out, they did vvhat they
could to disabuse <hi>Ragotin</hi> concerning his imaginary Wound,
but all to no purpose, for he still persisted that the felt the
Pain on't. They nevertheless put him into the Coach, and
arriv'd safe at <hi>Alençon.</hi> The next Day they vvould not Act
the Actresses being desirous of a little respite. The same Day
the <hi>Prior</hi> of St. <hi>Lewis</hi> returned from <hi>Sées,</hi> vvho going to
visit our Company, Madam <hi>Star</hi> told him that he could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

                     <hi>IF the beginning of this History,</hi> quoth the <hi>Prior, where you
have met with nothing but Ioy and Contentment, has been
tiresome to you, the rest you are about to hear, I fear will be
much more. This consists of nothing but the revers of Fortune,
and Despair, and Grief, for past Pleasures. To begin then where
I left off:</hi> 
                     <q>You must know, that after our Comrades and
I had got up our Parts, and rehears'd several times, we
Play'd perfect on <hi>Sunday</hi> Night, in Monsieur <hi>du Fresne</hi>'s
House, the rumour of which being got abroad in the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood,
so many People crowded thither, altho' we took
all the care we could to keep the Park-Gates shut, that we
found no small difficulty to get to the Stage, which we had
rais'd for us in a midling sort of a Hall. This Place being not
near large enough for our Audience, two Thirds of the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
were forc'd to stand without, whom to get rid of, we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd
them that on <hi>Sunday</hi> following, we would Play again
in the Town, and in a more spacious Room. We per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
our Parts indifferent well for Beginners, only one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
us who was to Act the Secretary of King <hi>Darius,</hi> the
Death of that Monarch being the Subject of our Play, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted
himself of ill, that altho'd he had not above two lengths
to speak, which he perform'd well enough at our Rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal,
yet when he came to Act in earnest, he was so faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted,
that we were forc'd to thrust him on upon the
Stage, where he spoke so extremely ill, that made all the
Audience to laugh. The Tragedy being ended, I began
the <hi>Ball</hi> with <hi>du Lys,</hi> which lasted till Midnight. We took
a great deal of Pleasure in this Exercise, and without say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ought to any Body, we quickly got up another Play,
I nevertheless did not omit to make my ordinary Visits in
the mean time. One Day as we were sitting together by
the Fire-side, a young Gentleman hapned to come in, to
whom we gave place. After we had discours'd a little while,
he put his Hand in his Pocket, and pull'd out a Picture in
Wax in <hi>Relievo.</hi> very well done, and which he said was the
Picture of his Mistriss. After all the Ladies had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>een it
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:53808:158"/>
round, it came to my turn to look on it. When I had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd
it a little, I found that it was made for <hi>du Lys</hi> to
whom I fancy'd this Gallant pretended. I therefore with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any more ado, threw the Box, Picture and all into
the Fire, where the little <hi>Bustum</hi> melted immediately; and
when the Owner thereof would have snatched it out, I
threatned to throw him out at the Window. Monsieur <hi>du
Fresne,</hi> who loved me as much at that time, as he hated
me afterwards, swore he would force that Intruder to make
more ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>e out than he had done in, and going to perform his
Oath, the young Spark skip'd over every bodys Head, and
ran out in Confusion. I follow'd him without any body
in the Companie being able to hinder me, and having o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertaken
him, told him, that if he took any thing amiss,
we two had each of us a Sword by our Sides, and were in
a convenient Place to decide the Difference. But his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
was, that he had nothing to say to me, and so went
his way. The <hi>Sunday</hi> following, we Acted the Play we
had done before, according to our Promise, in a great Hall
belonging to a Neighbour, by which means we had fifteen
Days to Study the other Play. I design'd to adorn it with
some Enterludes of Dancing, and for that purpose, chose
out six of my Companions that Danced the best, and made
the seventh my self. This Enterlude consisted of Shepherds
and Shepherdesses, that were desperately in love with each
other. In the first Entry <hi>Cupid</hi> appear'd, and in the others
the Shepherds and Shepherdesses, all drest in white, and
their Habits all beset with narrow Blue-ribbond Knots, which
was the Colour <hi>du Lys</hi> delighted in, and which I have worn
ever since, altho' for some reasons I will tell you hereafter, I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
added some Bows of Fillemot. These Shepherds and
Shepherdesses, made their Entrys two by two, and when they
were all together, they form'd the Letters of <hi>du Lys</hi>'s Name;
<hi>Love</hi> let fly a Dart at each Shepherd, and threw Flames
at the Shepherdesses, all which bow'd the Knee in Token
of Submission. I had composed some Verses to be Sung
in this Enterlude, and which we perform'd, but the great
length of time has made me to forget them, and if I had
remembred them, I should never have durst repeated them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you that are so good Judges. We having kept the
Acting of our second Play secret, we were not so embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rass'd
with Company as we had been before. The Play
was <hi>The Amours of</hi> Sacripantus <hi>King of</hi> Circassia <hi>with</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelica:
The Story taken from <hi>Ariosto.</hi> We perform'd the
Enterlude likewise, and <hi>I</hi> would have begun as we were wont
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:53808:159"/>
to do after the Play, but Monsieur <hi>du Fresne</hi> opposed it, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leging
we must needs be too much tir'd, and therefore
dismissed us. We resolv'd however private we had done it
now, to make the representation of this Play more publick,
and which we afterwards perform'd before every Body, in
my Godfather's Hall, on <hi>Shrove-Sunday,</hi> and in the Day time
<hi>Du Lys</hi> desired if I intended to have the Ball that Night, that
I would begin it with a young Lady a Neighbour of hers,
who was then drest in blue Taffeta as well as she, which
I did. Whilst we were dancing there arise a Whispering
among the Company, some whereof cry'd out aloud, <hi>He's
mistaken, he's deceiv'd,</hi> which made both <hi>du Lys</hi> and I laugh,
which the other Lady perceiving, cry'd, <hi>The People are in the
right, for you have taken one for the other.</hi> To which I
answered abruptly, <hi>Pardon me, Madam, I know what I do.</hi>
At Night I Masqu'd my self with three of my Comrades, and
carried a Flambeau to prevent my being known. In this
Equipage we went into the Park, and afterwards to the
House. My three Companions enter'd only, and I stood at
the Door. <hi>Du Lys</hi> observing the three Masques, presently
found that I was not among them, when coming to the Door
she immediately discover'd me, and spoke to me these obliging
Words. <hi>Disguize your self after what manner you please, for
I shall always know you.</hi> After-having put out the Flam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beau.
I came up to the Table where there was a Box
and Dice set. I took up the Box and began to rattle it,
whereupon <hi>du Lys</hi> ask'd me who I would be at? I made her
a sign I would be at her. She reply'd, <hi>How much will you
throw at?</hi> I pointed to a knot of Ribbons and Coral Braclet
which she wore on her Left Arm. Her Mother would by
no means have her venture that, but she burst out a laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
saying she was not affraid of venturing of it. I threw
and won, and afterwards made my Fair Adversary a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of my Winnings. The same did my Companions to
the elder Sister, and the other Ladies that were come to pass
their Evening there. After this we took our leaves; but
as we were going out, <hi>du Lys</hi> came behind me, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tying
the Ribbonds that held my Mask on, it immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
fell, whereat I turning about, she said to me, <hi>Thus
People are to be used that go away before their time.</hi> I was
a little ashamed, but nevertheless very glad to have any Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to talk farther with her. The others unmask'd like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
and we went in again, and spent that Night very
agreeably. The last Night of the <hi>Carnevale</hi> I gave the <hi>Ball</hi>
again, when we were fain to take up with the lesser Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:53808:159"/>
of Musicians, the greater being pre-engag'd by other
Gentry. During <hi>Lent</hi> we were forc'd to lay aside Diversions
a little, to give way for Devotion, and I can assure you for
our parts, <hi>du Lys</hi> and I never wanted a Sermon. The Feast
of <hi>Easter</hi> approaching, young Madam <hi>du Fresne</hi> ask'd me
laughing if I would carry her and her Sister to St. <hi>Pater,</hi> a
Village about a quarter of a League off from the Suburbs
of <hi>Montfort,</hi> whither People are wont to go out of Devotion on
<hi>Easter-Mundays,</hi> and where one meets all the <hi>Beau-Monde.</hi> I
answer'd that I would willingly wait on them both thither,
or any whither else. The Day when we were to go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
come, as I was going out of our House to fetch the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
I met a young fellow a Neighbour of mine, who ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
me whither I was going in such haste, I told him that
I was going to the Park to wait on the young Ladies there
to St. <hi>Pater.</hi> To which he reply'd that I might save my self
the labour, for to his certain Knowledge their Mother would
not permit them to go along with me. This News stund me
so much that I had not a Word to answer, but going into
my House I set my self about thinking what might be the
occasion of so sudden an alteration. After having reflected
on it a good while, I could guess at nothing but my little
Merit and mean Condition. This consider'd, I could not but
exclaim extremely against their Carriage to me, since they had
been well enough pleased with me as long as I diverted them
with <hi>Balls,</hi> Enterludes, Plays, and Serenades, which I fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
did to my no small charge, but now that those ceas'd
they slighted me. The anger I conceiv'd made me resolve to
go to the Assembly at St. <hi>Pater</hi> without them, whilst they it
seems were waiting for me in the Park. The time being
past that I promised to come, <hi>du Lys</hi> and her Sister, with
some other Ladies their Neighbours, went without me. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
having paid their Devotion in the Church, they came out
into the Church-yard, and seated themselves on the Wall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a great shady Elm. Some time after I passed by, but
that at a distance. <hi>Du Fresne</hi> made a sign to me to come
near them, which I took no notice of, making as if I did not
see them. Some Neighbours that were with me told me
some Lady becken'd to me, but I seem'd not to hear them like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
and going on cried at the same time, <hi>Come lets go and
drink a Bottle at the Four Winds,</hi> which we did. I were no
sooner got home to my House but a Widow who had been
formerly our <hi>Confidente,</hi> came to speak with me, telling me
briskly that she wonder'd how I could neglect doing my self
the Honour of vvaiting on the young Ladies <hi>du Fresne</hi> to St.
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:53808:160"/>
                        <hi>Pater;</hi> acquainting me moreover, that <hi>du Lys</hi> was very much
concern'd at the disappointment, and that I must endeavour
speedily by some means or other to make a compensation for
my Fault. I vvas extremely both surpriz'd and pleas'd to
hear this, and having let her knovv all the Reason I had,
vvhich I have acquainted you vvith before, I vvent along
vvith her to the Park-Gate vvhere the Ladies vvere. I left
her to make my Excuse, for I could not pretend to do it
my self, being so extremely troubled that I could not knovv
vvhat I said. Then the Mother, addressing her self to me,
told me that I ought not to have been so credulous to believe
vvhat People said, and that she believed vvhat had been told
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> vvas done by some body that envy'd me, and lastly, she
assured me that I should alvvays be unfeignedly vvelcome to
her House, and vvhither vve immediately vvent. I had
then the Honour to give my Hand once more to <hi>du Lys,</hi> vvho
assured me she had been extremely concern'd at my Carriage,
especially vvhen I seem'd not to take notice of the Sign her
Sister made me at St. <hi>Pater.</hi> I ask'd her Pardon humbly,
but made her but confuss'd excuses, being not yet entirely
come to my self. I vvould have been reveng'd on the young
Man that imposed upon me, had not <hi>du Lys</hi> entreated me not
so much as to think of it; adding, that I ought to be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
with finding the contrary of what he had told me. I
obey'd her in this, as I did in every thing always after. We
past our time the most agreeably that could be, and we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced
what is commonly said of Lovers, that their Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
is chiefly that of the Eyes. One <hi>Sunday</hi> after <hi>Vespers</hi>
we gave each other to understand by this mure Language that
we would after Supper go up the River, and have only such
Persons with us as we could best fancy. For this purpose I
sent presently to hire a Boat, and immediately after went my
self with the Companions I had pitch'd upon, to the Park-Gate,
where the Ladies waited for us; but as ill-Luck would
have it, three young Men that were not of our Company, were
at that juncture talking with them. They did what they
could to shake them off, but which they perceiving seem'd the
more desirous to stay. This was the reason that when we
came up to the Gate we thought fitting to pass by, contenting
our selves only with tipping them the Wink to follow us<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
which they soon after did, but with the young Fellows along
with them, which we perceiving immediately enter'd our Boat,
and landed near one of the Gates of the City, where we
met the Si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ar <hi>du Fresne,</hi> who forthwith demanded of me
where I had left his Daughters? I not knowing presently wha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                        <pb n="323" facs="tcp:53808:160"/>
Answer to make told him frankly, that I had not had the
Honour to see them all that Night. Having heard this,
he took his leave, bidding us good Night, and went towards
his Park, at the Gate whereof he overtook his Daughters,
whom asking where and with whom they had been, <hi>du Lys</hi>
pertly answer'd with such a one, naming me. At that the
Father reach'd her a sound Box o'th'Ear, together with you
<hi>Lye</hi> at the end on't; <hi>for,</hi> continu'd he, <hi>had he been with you
tho' it were much later, I should never have ask'd you the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion.</hi>
Next Day the aforesaid Widow came again to let me
know what had happen'd the Night foregoing, and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
me that <hi>du Lys</hi> was extremely Angry with me, not
only at the box o'th'Ear she had received on my account, but
also at my disappointing of her, she intending to have got quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
rid of those Impertinent young Fellows. I excused my self
as well as I could, and declin'd going near her for four Days
together. But one Day, as she and her Sister sat with some
other young Ladies on a Bench before a Shop in a Street
next to the City Gate which I was going out at to the
Suburbs, I passed by them, moving my Hat a little, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
looking much upon them, or saying any thing to them.
The other Ladies immediately ask'd what was the meaning
of my so cold Deportment, which they scarce took to be Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil?
<hi>Du Lys</hi> gave them no Answer, but her elder Sister
told them that she did not know the Reason, and that if they
had a mind to be satisfied in it, they must know it from my
self. Adding moreover, <hi>Come let us go place our selves a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

nearer the Gate, that he may not be able to get by us as he
comes back without taking more notice.</hi> I quickly return'd,
when this good Sister catching me hold by the Cloak, and
pulling me to her, said to me, <hi>How comes it Haughty Sir,
that you can pass by your Mistress without taking any notice?</hi>
and at the same time pulled me down by her, but when
I turned to embrace her, and tell her the reason, she slung
away like a Mad thing. I staid a little longer with them
and after went my ways. I resolv'd then not to go near
my Mistress for some Days longer, and which I perform'd,
but which seem'd as so many Ages to me, till at length one
Morning I met Madam <hi>du Fresne,</hi> who stopping me ask'd me
what had made me so great a stranger to her House? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd
that it was the ill-humour of her younger Daughter,
whereupon she immediately promis'd to make up the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
betwixt us, and bid me meet her within an Hour at her
House. I was not a little impatient till I had obey'd her and
herefore went at the time appointed to Madam <hi>du Fresnes</hi> House,
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:53808:161"/>
As I was going up into her Chamber according to her Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
I met <hi>du Lys</hi> coming down, who perceiving me, made
so much haste by me, that I could not stop her. I after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
went into the Chamber, where I found her Sister,
who began immediately to Simper, whereupon I told her
how briskly her Sister had gone by me, but she assur'd me
that that was all seigned, and that to her Knowledge, she
had gone a Hundred times to the Window, to look whether
she could see me, and farther, that she was now gone but into
the Garden, whither I might go after her if I pleas'd. I
took the hint, and went to the Garden-door, but found
it lockt, whereupon I beg'd of her to open it, but she would
not, which her Sister hearing from the top of the Stairs,
came down and open'd it for me, by a Trick she had got.
I went in, but <hi>du Lys</hi> ran from me as if she had been Mad.
I followed and overtook her, and catching her by one of
her Sleeves, pull'd her dovvn upon a Camomil-bank,
clapping my self at the same time dovvn by her; I made
her all the Excuses that I vvas capable of doing, but she
continued inexorable, at length I acquainted her, that my
Passion vvas not to be fool'd vvith, and that therefore i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>
she did not quickly think fit to let me knovv her Mind
Despair might drive me to the doing of something, vvhich
she might repent having been the Cause of. This never
theless vvrought nothing upon her, the vvhich perceiving,

                        </gap>
She thereupon rise to be gone, informing me, that she ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <q>One Day, as the Sieur <hi>du Fresne,</hi> his Wife, <hi>du Lys</hi> and
I were Walking together in the Park, this good Mother told
me aside, that she had been a faithful Advocate in my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half.
She might easily speak this without her Husbands
hearing of it, since he was very deaf. We both thank'd
her however, rather by Gesture than Words. A little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
Monsieur <hi>du Fresne</hi> took me aside, and told me, that his
Wife and he had agreed to give me their younger Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in Marriage, before he went to Court to wait his Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in his turn, and therefore desir'd I would put my self
to no more Charges in Serenades or the like. I return'd
him my Acknowledgments, but after a confus'd manner,
being more than ordinarily Transported at so unexpected
a Happiness. But I well remember, I told him, that I should
never have dar'd to have ask'd his Daughter in Marriage,
as well considering my small Merit, as the inequality of
our Conditions. To which he answer'd, that as for Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
he was well satisfied that I had sufficient, and for Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
every body knew I had that would very well supply
it, meaning I suppose, my Estate. I don't remember what
reply I gave, but this I know well, that he invited me to
Supper that Night, and where it was concluded, that the <hi>Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi>
following, we should have a Meeting of our Friends to
finish the Nuptials. He acquainted me likewise, what Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
he design'd to give with his Daughter, but as for that
I told him I had sufficient for us both, and therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
her Person only. Then I thought my self the most
happy Man in the World: But alas! That Happiness did
not last long, for the Night before the Day that we were
to be Marryed, as <hi>du Lys</hi> and I were sitting upon a Grass-plat,
we perceiv'd at a distance, a Councellor of the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidial</hi>-Court,
coming to pay a Visit to the Sieur <hi>du Fresne</hi> his
Kinsman, whereat both she and I conceiv'd the same thought
at a time, and began to be both concern'd, tho' we knew
not well at what, which nevertheless, the event of what we
feared made but too perspicuous. For next Day, when
I went to meet the Company at <hi>du Fresne</hi>'s House, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Agreement, I found <hi>du Lys</hi> at the Court-gate crying.
Upon asking her what she ail'd, I could obtain no answer,
whereupon I enter'd into the House, and found her Sister
in the same Condition. I ask'd her likewise, what was the
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:53808:162"/>
meaning of so many Tears? She answer'd sobbing, that
I would know but too soon. Then I went up into the
Chamber, and found the Mother, but she no sooner saw me,
than she went out, without scarce speaking a Word to me,
for Tears, Sobbs, and Sighs had so disturbed her, that all
she could do, was to look pittifully upon me, and cry,
<hi>Ah poor young Man!</hi> I resolved to know the Cause of this
sudden Change, and therefore immediately went to Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>du Fresne</hi>'s Chamber, where I found him sitting in an
Elbow-chair. At my coming in, he told me bluntly, that
he had alter'd his Mind, and would not now Marry his
younger Daughter before his elder, and tho' he did Marry
her, it should be sure not to be before his return from Court.
I answer'd upon these two Heads, first, That his elder Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
would not at all be displeas'd, to have her younger
Sister Marryed before her, providing it were to me, since
she had always loved me as her Brother, and more than once
professed as much. And secondly, I acquainted him that I
would willingly stay for her ten Years, instead of three
Months that he should be from home. At last, he told me
in plain Terms, that I must think no more of his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and so turn'd from me. Having heard this, I imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
determin'd to go home and kill my self. But as
I was drawing forth my Sword for that purpose, the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid
Widow, that had formerly been our Confidence,
came in upon me where I was, and prevented me in that
Design, by telling me that she came from <hi>du Lys,</hi> and that
she desired me by her, not to afflict my self, but have Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
and Matters might perhaps change to my advantage.
She farther inform'd me from her, that I had her Mother
and Sister sure to my Interest, and above all herself, whose
Kindness and Constancy to me was unalterable. She like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
told me, that the Sisters had resolved as soon as their
Father was gone, that they would give me an opportunity to
continue my Visits as before. Tho' this Discourse was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
pleasing to me, yet could it not altogether comfort
me, for I afterwards fell into so deep a Melancholy, that
Despair suggested to me, to consult the Devil about my
Fate. Hereupon, a little before Monsieur <hi>du Fresne</hi>'s De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture,
I went to a large Copse, about half a League from
the Town, where it was the Vulgar Report, that evil Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
inhabited, and where 'tis certain the Fairies, who are
no doubt the Devil's Imps, had formerly been. I went a
great way into this Copse, and when I thought I was far
enough, I began to call upon, and invoke the Spirits to
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:53808:162"/>
Assist me in this worst of Misfortunes; but after I had
Pray'd and Bawl'd for some time to no purpose, and only
heard the Birds warble, which I interpreted to be their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
for my Misfortune, I return'd home to my House,
not at all satisfied, when throwing my self upon the Bed,
I was immediately seiz'd with such a wild Frenzy, that I
even lost my Speech, insomuch, that 'twas thought I could
never have escap'd Death. <hi>Du Lys</hi> was ill at the same time,
and much after the same manner, which has inclin'd me
to believe ever since, that there is something in Sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
more than ordinary, for as the Cause of our Sickness
was the same, so was its effect, which we understood by
our Doctor and Apothecary, having both the same, but as
for our Surgeon's they were several. I grew well a little
before <hi>du Lys,</hi> which made me to go, or I might rather say,
be carryed to see her. When I came to her House, I found
her a Bed, and her Father gone to Court. She no sooner
saw me, but she seem'd to recover, which made me desire
her to rise, but she was no sooner got out of Bed, than she
fainted away in my Arms. This made me extremely sorry
that I had desir'd so unreasonable a thing of her, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I had her immediately put to Bed again, where after
some time, I left her to recover by Sleep, which perhaps she
would not have done had I staid with her. Not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
we were both entirely recovered, and pass'd our time
very pleasantly, all the while her Father continued absent,
till at last returning again, he was inform'd by some secret
Enemies of ours, that I had kept his Daughter company
ever since he had been from home. This made him to
rave extremely, and to forbid his Wife and Daughters see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
me any more, which I learnt afterwards by our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidente,
as likewise, that they had notwithstanding engaged
in a Resolution to see me often, and inform'd me of the
means by this Widow. The first was, that I should observe
when this unkind Father came into the City, when I might
go to his House, and continue there till his return, which
was well enough known by his Knock. Then were I to
step behind the Tapistry, and afterwards, while either a
Man or Maid, or one of his Daughters took off his Cloak,
I might easily slip out behind him, which he could never hear,
by reason as I have told you before, that he was Deaf.
This contrivance I frequently made use of, but which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at length discovered, I was forc'd to have recourse to
another, which was to meet my Mistriss and Friends in
our Confidentes Garden, which I did several times, but at
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:53808:163"/>
last that Plot was discovered likewise. We then made use
of the Churches for that purpose, but which also came to
be known: So that at last, we had nothing to rely upon
but common Chance, which now and then afforded us a
Meeting in one or other of the Walks of the Park, but then
we were fain to use a great deal of caution to prevent being seen.
One Day after I had been with <hi>du Lys</hi> a considerable while,
for we div'd to the very bottom of our Misfortunes, and took
all the Measures imaginable to furmount them, I would needs
accompany her to the lower-Court-Gate, where being just
come, we perceived at a distance her Father coming directly
towards us from the Town. To fly was to no purpose, for
he had already seen us. She then immediately entreated me
to think of some Invention to excuse us: I put off that task
upon her, alledging she had the more subtile Capacity. In
the mean time the old Gentleman got up with us, and whilst
he was going to scold, she told him that I having understood
that he had some Rings and other Jewels by him, for he
had Jewellers always at Work for him, being as Covetous as
he was Deaf, I was come to know if he would please to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
me with some to present a young Lady at <hi>Mans</hi> whom
I was going to Marry. He was easily enclin'd to credit my
pretence, and carrying me up Stairs he shewed me several,
whereof I chose two, one a small Diamond, and the other a
Rose of Emeralds. We presently agreed on the price, which
I paid him down on the Spot. This expedient gain'd me a
continuance of my Visits for some time till at length beginning
to grow jealous of the Cheat, he demanded of his Daughter
why I did not make more haste to <hi>Mans.</hi> She thereupon
advised me to go thither for a little time, which I did.
This City is one of the pleasantest in the whole Kingdom,
as ye know very well, and where there is the most Quality,
which induced me to make plenty of Acquaintance. I lodg'd
at the <hi>Green Oaks,</hi> where also lay at the same time an <hi>Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator,</hi>
who kept a Stage to sell his Physick on, but that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
till such time as he could get a Company of <hi>Strollers</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
to Act, that being his principal design. He had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
got several Persons of Quality, and among others a
Counts Son, whose Name I shall beg leave to conceal; a
young Lawyer of <hi>Mans,</hi> who had formerly belong'd to a
Company, together with a Brother of his, and an old Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>median,
who was a great Proficient in <hi>Farce.</hi> He besides
expected a young Lady from <hi>Laval,</hi> who had promised him
to run away from her Father for that purpose. With this
Man I got acquainted, and one Day for want of better dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:53808:163"/>
I made him acquainted with all my Misfortunes,
whereupon he persuaded me to engage with him in his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,
and that might prove a means to make me forget my
hard usage. I readily accepted his offer, and would have
certainly engag'd in it had but the Lady that was expected
come. But it seems her Parents had been acquainted of her
Intentions, and consequently took care to prevent them, which
obliged me to quit the Undertaking. But Love notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
furnish'd me with a Stratagem to renew my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
with <hi>du Lys</hi> without Suspition, and that was to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
the Lawyer beforemention'd, and another young Man of
my Acquaintance, to both whom I had discover'd my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,
along with me to <hi>Alençon.</hi> They soon after appear'd
in this City, one under the title of a Brother, and the other
a Cousin German of an imaginary Mistress of mine. I car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
them to the Sieur <hi>du Fresne</hi>'s House, whom I had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
desired to pass for my Relation, which he condescended
to do. He did not fail likewise to say a great many fine
things in my Favour, assuring them that they had pitchd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a very deserving Person to make an Alliance with, after
which he invited us to Supper. My Mistresses Health was
drunk and <hi>du Lys</hi> pledg'd it. After my Friends had continu'd
about four or five Days in this City they return'd to <hi>Mans,</hi>
but I staid after them, and had a freer access than ever to my
Mistress. At last Monsieur <hi>du Fresne</hi> asked me why I delay'd
so long to conclude my Marriage, which made me to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
that my Stratagem might be at length discover'd,
and then I should shamefully be driven out of the House as
before. This made me to enter into the most barbarous Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
that ever Man in Despair conceiv'd, and which was
to kill <hi>du Lys</hi> to prevent anothers ever having the Possession
of her. For this purpose I got a Ponyard, and going to
her desired her to take a Walk out with me, which she
granted. I thereupon led her before she was aware into a
brambly part of the Park quite out of any Path-way. There
I discover'd to her the cruel design Despair had suggested to
me to preserve her to my self, and at the same time drew the
naked Ponyard out of my Pocket. She looked so charming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon me, and spoke so many soft things to divert my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions,
that she at length found it no difficult matter to
disarm me. She seiz'd the Ponyard then, and throwing it
into the Bushes told me she must be gone, and that she should
not care to trust her self any more with me alone. She
was going to tell me farther, that she never had deserved this
usage at my Hands, when I interrupted her, desiring she
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:53808:164"/>
would afford me a meeting next Day at her <hi>Confidentes.</hi>
She promised, and accordingly came. I Saluted her and we
lamented our common Misfortune together, and after a great
deal of Discourse she advis'd me to go to <hi>Paris,</hi> 
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
that tho' I staid away Ten Years she <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
no Body else in the mean time, which nevertheless
she did not keep. When I was about to take leave of her,
which you may imagine I could not do without a great
many Tears, she said she thought it necessary that her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and Sister should be of the Secret, and therefore the Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
was immediately to call them<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

with her. It was then that we open'd our Minds to each
other more than we had hitherto done, and at length she told
me, that if I had Thoughts of carrying her away, she would
willingly consent to it, and follow me wheresoever I went,
and that if any were sent out after us, and should overtake
us, she would pretend to be with Child by me. However
my Love was so Honourable towards her, that I would by
no means consent to any hazard of her Reputation on my
account, but leave the event of all things to Fortune. In
the interim her Mother and Sister were come, and we broke
our Resolutions to them, which caused fresh Tears and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces
on all sides. In short I took my leave of them in
order to my Journey to <hi>Paris.</hi> Before I set out I writ a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to <hi>du Lys,</hi> the Contents whereof I have forgot, but you
may imagine I omitted nothing therein that might serve to
raise her Compassion, and my <hi>Confidente</hi> that carry'd it as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sur'd
me that she could not read it for Weeping, and much
less return me an Answer. I have forborn telling the several
other Adventures that happen'd during our Amour, that I
might not trespass too far on your Patience. Such as the
jealousie <hi>du Lys</hi> conceived at a Cousin-German of hers that
came to see her, and lived at her Fathers for three Months
together, as also on account of the Gentleman's Daughter that
brought the Gallant whom I sent away packing. Together
with several Rencountres I had by Night for her sake, in
two whereof I was Wounded, once in the Arm, and another
time in the Thigh. But to end all Digressions, I must e'en
let you know that I departed at last for <hi>Paris,</hi> where I ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd
safe, and continued about a Year. But not being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to maintain my self there equal to what I had done
in this City, as well by reason of the excessive dearness of
Provisions, as by having diminished my Fortune by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences
I were at on account of <hi>du Lys,</hi> as you have heard
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:53808:164"/>
before I was fain to put my self to one of the King's Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretaries,
who had been married to his Predecessors Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow.
Tho' this Lady confer'd many Favours upon me yet
I was always so blind as not to perceive them, tho' some of
them were so open that most of the Family took notice of
them. One Day after I had bought some Holland for Neck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands
and Wristbands to my Shirts, and given them to some
of the Maid Servants to make, my Mistress came and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
them, when asking who they were for, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
they were mine, she bid them finish them assoon as
they could, but leave the Lace for her to put on. Afterwards
whilst she was Working upon them, I by chance enter'd the
Chamber when she called to me, and told me she was at
Work for me, which surprized me so much that I could
only return her Thanks and so went out. But one Morning
to my greater wonder, whilst I was Writing in my Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
which was not very far from hers, she sent for me by
one of the Lackeys. Whilst I was going to her I heard her
rave like Mad against one of her Chamber Maids, and her
Waiting-Gentlewoman in these Words, <hi>Get ye out of my Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
ye Blunderers, ye Buffleheads, you know not how to do any
thing as ye should do.</hi> When they went out I came in,
whereupon, after having Rallied them a little longer, she
bid me shut the Door and come and help dress her, and
particularly to take the clean Smock from the Toilet and
put it on for her. At the same time she stript off her foul
one, and exposed her self naked to my sight. I was so great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
asham'd at this Action of hers, that I told her that I
should be less Serviceable to her that way than her Maids,
and therefore desired her to send for them again, which she
was nevertheless oblig'd to do by the sudden arrival of her
Husband. I had no reason to doubt of her Intentions, but
as I was young and timerous, I was apprehensive of some
unlucky Accident, and therefore resolv'd to ask speedily to be
gone from her Service, which I did soon after, whereto the
Husband answer'd nothing but retir'd, and the Wife sullenly
turn'd her Chair towards the Fire and bid the Butler clear the
Table. After this, I went down to Supper with the Steward,
and being at Table, a Neece of my Ladys, of about twelve
Years old, came to me from her Aunt, to know whether I had
the courage to eat before I went. I forgot what answer
I sent her, but I well remember that she immediately fell
sick and was forc'd to keep her Bed. Next Morning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
she sent for me to go for a Physician. When I came
near her Bed-side, she catch'd me by the Hand, and told
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:53808:165"/>
me plainly, that I had been the occasion of her Illness.
This augmented my former Apprehensions, and therefore
the same Day I Listed my self in the Troops that were
then raising at <hi>Paris,</hi> for the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> and depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
without saying ought to any Body. Our Captain came
not along with us, leaving the command of his Company to his
Lieutenant, who was a common Robber, as likewise were
the two Sergeants, for they Plunder'd wherever they came,
and were at last Hang'd by the Provost of <hi>Troyes</hi> in <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagne,</hi>
but who spar'd one of the Sergeants, on account of
his being Brother to one of the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi>'s Valet
de Chambres. We hereby remain'd without a Leader,
whereupon the Soldiers with common Consent pitch'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
me to Command the Company, which consisted of Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score
Men. I took this Post upon me, with that Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
as if I had really been the Captain. I drew out my
Company, and Mustered them, and Distributed the Arms
amongst them, which I receiv'd at St. <hi>Reine</hi> in <hi>Burgundy.</hi>
at length we fil'd off to <hi>Embrun</hi> in <hi>Dauphiny,</hi> where our
Captain came to us, expecting scarce to find a Man in his
Company, but when he perceiv'd all I had done, and that
I had preserv'd Sixty eight of the Men, having lost only
twelve in our March, he hugg'd me heartily, and gave me
the Colours and his Table. The Army was one of the
finest that ever went out of <hi>France,</hi> but which had the ill
Success you may have heard of, meerly thro' the bad In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence
between the Generals. After its Defeat, I staid
at <hi>Grenoble,</hi> to avoid the Barbarity of the Peasants of <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy</hi>
and <hi>Champagne,</hi> who murder'd all that fled in such
great numbers, that it introduc'd the Plague in those two
Provinces, and which afterwards likewise spread it self
throughout the whole Kingdom. Having staid some time
at <hi>Grenoble,</hi> where I got a great deal of Acquaintance, I
resolv'd to go for this City where I was Born, but tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling
out of the High-road, for the reason above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
I came at length to a small Town, call'd St. <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trick.</hi>
where the Lady of the Mannors Son was raising a
Company of Foot, to go to the Siege of <hi>Montauban.</hi> I
Listed under him, and he having discovered something
more than ordinary in my Countenance, after having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
of me who I was, and being told the Truth by
me, he desir'd me to accept of the Tutelage of a young Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of his, to whom he had given the Colours, and which
I readily did. We departed then for <hi>Noeiis</hi> in <hi>Provence,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Place of Rendezouz for the Regiment, but before
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:53808:165"/>
we had been there three Days, our Captain's Steward robb'd
his Master and fled. He gave Orders to have him persu'd,
but which prov'd to no purpose. He then desir'd me to
take the Keys of his Coffers, which I did not keep long,
by reason he was commanded from the Regiment, to wait
on the great Cardinal <hi>Richelieu,</hi> who then headed the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
for the Siege of <hi>Montauban,</hi> and other rebellious Towns
of <hi>Guyenne</hi> and <hi>Languedoc.</hi> He nevertheless carryed me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
with him, and we found his <hi>Eminence</hi> in the Town
of <hi>Albi,</hi> whence we waited on him to the aforesaid rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious
City, but which continued not long so, after this
great States-man's setting down before it. During this March
we had a great number of Adventures, which I don't think
fit to bring you acquainted with, for fear of proving tire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some,
having but too just reason to believe that I have been
so too much already—<hi>To this</hi> Star <hi>reply'd, that he
would deprive them of a great deal of Pleasure, if he did not
continue his Adventures to the end. He went on then, after
the following manner—</hi> I got a great acquaintance in this
Illustrious Cardinal's House, and that chiefly with the Pages,
whereof there were eighteen of <hi>Normandy,</hi> who all made ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme
much of me, as did likewise the rest of his <hi>Eminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
Servants. As soon as the Town was yielded up, our
Regiment was Disbanded, and we return'd to St. <hi>Patrick.</hi>
The Lady of the Mannor had a Suit at Law with her eld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Son, and was going to <hi>Grenoble</hi> to Prosecute it. As soon
as we were got home, we were desir'd to accompany her
thither, but which I had no manner of Mind to do, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
determin'd to go as I told you before: We were how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
prevail'd upon to comply with her request, which I
have not since repented of; for whilst we were at <hi>Grenoble</hi>
solliciting the Suit, the late King of <hi>France Lewis</hi> XIII hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to pass by that way into <hi>Italy,</hi> when I had the Honour
to meet in his Retinue, with all the great Lords of this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and amongst the rest, the Governour of this City, who
being well acqainted with Monsieur <hi>de</hi> St. <hi>Patrice,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
having offer'd me what Money I wanted, recommended
me heartily to him, so that I had then no reason to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain.
I met likewise five young Men of this City, three
whereof were Gentlemen, who had been my intimate Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance.
I treated them the best that I could, both at
our House and at the Tavern. One Day as we were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from Breakfast at an Inn, in the Suburbs of St. <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi>
which is on the other side of the Water, we hapned
to stop upon the Bridge to see the Boats pass, when one of
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:53808:166"/>
the Five told me seriously, that he very much wonder<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>
why I had not enquir'd of them after <hi>du Lys.</hi> I told him
I durst not, for fear of hearing that which would not please
me. They reply'd, I had done well to slight her that had
broke her Word to me. I thought I should have dyed at
this News, but however I must know more to the same
purpose, for they immediately acquainted me farther, that my
Departure for <hi>Italy</hi> was no sooner heard of, than <hi>du Lys</hi>
was Marry'd by her Parents to a young Man, whom they
nam'd to me, and to whom I had the most aversion of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of her Pretenders. Then I began to break out and rail
against her, in all the ill Language that Jealousie could sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest
to me; I call'd her Tygress, Traitress and the like,
for that she could suffer herself to be Marry'd, when she
knew I was so near, and would certainly require an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
both from him and her. I then took a Purse out of
my Pocket which she had given me, and wherein I kept
a Bracelet of hers, and a blue Ribbon, and putting a Stone
into it to make it sink, I threw it in a great Passion into the
River, speaking these Words at the same time: <hi>So may I
blot her out of my Memory, as I abandon this Purse to the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of the Waves.</hi> These Gentlemen were not a little sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd
at my Proceeding, and therefore told me that they
were extremely sorry that they had let me know so much,
which nevertheless I would have come to the knowledge of
some way or other. They added moreover to comfort me,
that what <hi>du Lys</hi> had done was wholly by compulsion, for
they perfectly perceiv'd an aversion in her to the Person,
and which was demonstrable enough, in that she languish'd
all the time she was Marry'd to him, and died not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
This News encreas'd my Grief, and comforted me at
the same time. I took leave of these Gentlemen, and went
home, but so alter'd, that young Madam St. <hi>Patrice,</hi> the
good Ladies Daughter observ'd it, and ask'd me what I
ail'd. I gave her no answer but at length upon pressing
me farther, I told her the Story of my whole Adventures,
together with the News I had just heard. This good Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd
young thing, was extremely concern'd at the Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which might be perceiv'd by her crying, and went im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
and told it to her Mother and Brothers, who all
assur'd me they commiserated my Misfortunes, and would do
all that lay in their Power to redress them, but that in the
mean time I must be comforted and have Patience. The Suit
betwixt the Mother and the Son, ended by an Arbitration,
and so we return'd. I then began to think of settling in the
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:53808:166"/>
World. The House where I was, would have been sufficient to
have afforded me a Character, had I been dispos'd to Marry, but
tho'several good Matches were offer'd me, yet would I accept of
none. Then I return'd to my former design of being a <hi>Capuchine,</hi>
and required the Habit, but I met with so many obstacles
in this intention which would be but redious for you to hear,
that I quitted that design likewise. About this time the
King commanded the <hi>Arrierban</hi> of the Gentry of <hi>Dauphiny</hi>
to go to <hi>Casal.</hi> Monsieur <hi>de St. Patrice</hi> desir'd me to go along
with him, which I could not well refuse. We departed
and arriv'd there, and you know what was the success of it.
The Siege was rais'd, the Town given up, and Peace con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
through the Mediation of <hi>Mazarine.</hi> This was the
first step he made to the Cardinalship, and to that prodigious
Grandeur which he arriv'd to afterwards in the Government
of <hi>France.</hi> We return'd to St. <hi>Patrice</hi> where I still persisted
in becoming a <hi>Recluse,</hi> but divine Providence order'd it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.
One Day Monsieur <hi>de St. Patrick</hi> perceiving my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution,
told me he would advise me to take Orders as a
secular Priest. I reply'd I had not Capacity: he answer'd
there was those that had less. I resolv'd then upon it, and
took Orders upon an allowance of a Hundred Livres a Year
that Madam <hi>St. Patrice</hi> gave me. I said my first Mass in
our Parish Church, and upon which occasion my Patroness
treated about Thirty Priests and several Gentry of the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood.
I liv'd with too rich People to want Preferment,
for in six Months time I got a considerable <hi>Priory,</hi> and two
other small Benefices. Some Years after I had a very large
<hi>Priory</hi> and a very good Curateship given me, for I had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
a great deal of pains in my Study, and was arriv'd
to that perfection in Preaching that I could mount the Pulpit
before the best Auditory, and even in presence of any Bishop.
I manag'd my Revenues with discretion, and in a short time
got together a considerable Sum of Money, wherewith I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir'd
into this City, where I think my self extremely happy
in meeting with so good Company, as likewise in having
done them some small Service.</q> 
                     <hi>Rather,</hi> quoth <hi>Star, the
greatest that could be done for any Body.</hi> She was going to say
more when <hi>Ragotin</hi> started up and said he would write a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
upon this Story, which would afford a more than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Decoration of the Stage: For Example, a fine Park with
a great Wood, and a River with Lovers Walking and Fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and a Priest saying his first Mass in it, What could be
<hi>finer?</hi> This made all the Company laugh, when <hi>Roquebrune</hi>
who had all along contradicted him told him. <hi>You will never
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:53808:167"/>
be able to do any thing in the Matter. You know nothing of the
Rules of the Stage; besides you must change the Scene, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
three or four Years upon it.</hi> Then the <hi>Prior</hi> said, <q>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,
pray don't dispute upon this point, for I have taken
care of it my self already. You may remember that Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>du Hardy</hi> never observ'd Rules so strictly, no more than
some others of our late Poets have done, such as the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of St. <hi>Eustace,</hi> &amp;c. Monsieur <hi>Corneille</hi> likewise would
not have been so nice in that particular had not Monsieur
<hi>Scudery</hi> been so severe on his <hi>Cid.</hi> But for the most part
these are such Faults as the better sort of Judges term beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
ones. I must tell you, quoth the <hi>Prior,</hi> I have Compos'd
a Play on the Subject of my Adventures my self, and have
call'd it <hi>Fidelity preserv'd after Hope lost.</hi> I have also taken
for my Device a wither'd Tree with only a few blasted Leaves
on it, and a Spaniel-Dog lying at the Root of it with this
Motto out of his Mouth, <hi>Depriv'd of</hi> Hope <hi>yet always</hi> Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.
My Play hath been acted several times.</q> 
                     <hi>The Title
you have chose for it,</hi> quoth <hi>Star, is as much</hi> à propos <hi>as your</hi>
Device <hi>and</hi> Motto, <hi>for your Mistress has prov'd false to you,
yet you continue constant to her, resolving never to Marry any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
The Conversation ended by the arrival of Monsieur <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville</hi>
and Monsieur <hi>de la Garrouffiere,</hi> and here ends this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
which no doubt has been tedious as well in regard of its
length as Subject.</p>

                  <head type="sub">Verville's return, accompanied by Monsieur de la
Garrouffiere. The Actors and Actresses Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages;
together with an Adventure of Rago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin's.</head>
                  <p>ALL the Company were extremely surpriz'd to see Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>de la Garrouffiere.</hi> As for <hi>Verville</hi>'s return it had
been long expected with impatience, and that chiefly by the
two Couples that were to be Married. The Company demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of <hi>la Garrouffiere</hi> what News he had brought. He answer'd
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:53808:167"/>
none but that Monsieur <hi>Verville</hi> having communicated an Affair
of Importance to him he was glad of the occasion to come
and see them again, and to offer them a continuance of his
Services. Hereupon <hi>Verville</hi> made a sign to him that that
matter was to be talked of in private, and to break off the
discourse he presently presented the <hi>Prior</hi> of St. <hi>Lewis</hi> to him,
who he told him was his particular Friend, and moreover
a Man of Worth. Then <hi>Star</hi> told them he had just conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a Story the most entertaining that could be imagin'd,
which caused these two new arriv'd Gentlemen to profess
their concern for not having come before to have had their
share of it. Then <hi>Verville</hi> went into another Room, whither
<hi>Destiny</hi> soon followed him, when after they had continu'd there
for some time, they called in <hi>Star</hi> and <hi>Angelica,</hi> and afterwards
<hi>Leander</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Cave,</hi> whom Monsieur <hi>de la Garrouffiere</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
without invitation. When they were altogether Monsieur
<hi>Verville</hi> told them that he had acquainted Monsieur <hi>la Garrouf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiere</hi>
with the Design of their Inter-Marriages, whilst he was
at <hi>Rennes,</hi> and that he had presently resolv'd to go home by
<hi>Alençon,</hi> to assist at the Weddings. The two Couples gave
him a great deal of Thanks, and return'd him their Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments
of the Honour he had done them. <hi>But now I think
on't,</hi> quoth Monsieur <hi>Verville</hi> to <hi>la Garrouffiere, had not we best
have the Man up that waits below.</hi> 
                     <q>I think so, <hi>reply'd</hi> la
Garrouffiere, if the Company were willing.</q> They answer'd
any Friend of his or Monsieur <hi>Vervilles</hi> would be welcome at
any time to them. The Man was thereupon sent for up. As
soon as he enter'd the Room Mrs. <hi>Cave</hi> look'd stedfastly upon
him, and began to be mov'd, tho' she knew not for what. She
was ask'd if she knew that Man? She answer'd she could
not remember she had ever seen him. Then she was desired
to take more notice of his Face, which she did, and began to
find so many of her own Features in him that she cry'd out,
<hi>It is not my Brother sure?</hi> Whereupon he immediately went
to her, and embracing her, told her that he was her Brother
whom variety of Misfortunes had kept so long from the
sight of her. He afterwards Saluted his Neice and the rest
of the Company, and then assisted at the secret Conference,
where it was concluded that the two Marriages should be
speedily Solemniz'd. All the difficulty at last was what Priest
should Marry them. Then the <hi>Prior</hi> who had been called in
to the Conference stept up, and said he would talk about that
with the Parsons of the two Parishes in the City, and of that
of the Suburbs of <hi>Montfort,</hi> and if they made any difficulty
about it, he would return to <hi>Sées</hi> and obtain leave of that
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:53808:168"/>
Bishop, and providing he would not grant it, he would go and
procure it from the Bishop of <hi>Mans,</hi> who was his intimate
Acquaintance, and within whose Diocess his small concern lay.
The Company was very well pleased with his Proposal, and
desired him to take that trouble upon him. Then was a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
privately sent for, and the Marriage Contracts drawn. I
don't tell you the Particulars of them, because they never came
to my knowledge, but certain it is, that the Parties were soon
after Married accordingly. Monsieur <hi>Verville,</hi> Monsieur <hi>de la
Garrouffiere</hi> and the <hi>Prior</hi> of St. <hi>Lewis</hi> were the Witnesses to the
Contracts. This last went immediately to discourse the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
Parsons, but neither of them would Marry them, alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
several reasons that the <hi>Prior</hi> perhaps was unable to answer
for want of Capacity. This made him resolve according to his
promise to go to <hi>Sées.</hi> For this purpose he took <hi>Leanders</hi> Horse
and one of his Servants, and went to wait on the Bishop of that
Diocess who was very unwilling to grant his Request. The
<hi>Prior</hi> urg'd that these People were truly of no Diocess, being
here to Day and gone to Morrow, and yet they could not be
reputed Vagabonds, as the three Parsons would needs have them
to be, by reason that they had the Kings Licence, and by
consequence were Subjects of that Diocess wherever they
happen'd to come. Also that those Persons for whom he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd
a <hi>Licence</hi> were at present in the Diocess of <hi>Alençon,</hi>
over which his Lordship had Jurisdiction, and that therefore
he humbly requested the favour of a <hi>Licence</hi> for them, they
being very honest People. Hereupon the Bishop gave the <hi>Prior</hi>
liberty to have them Married in what Church he pleased.
He would have called his Secretary to have drawn up the
<hi>Licence</hi> in Form, but the <hi>Prior</hi> told him that a Word or two
under his own Hand would be sufficient. Next Day our Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citor
return'd to <hi>Alençon,</hi> where he found the betroath'd Parties
making all manner of Preparations for their Nuptials. The
other <hi>Strollers</hi> who had not been admitted of the secret won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
what all that Provision meant, but especially <hi>Ragotin</hi>
who was most concern'd to know it. What oblig'd them to
keep it so secret related wholly to <hi>Destiny,</hi> for as for <hi>Leander</hi>
and <hi>Angelica,</hi> ever body knew they were to be Married.
Another Reason likewise was their fear of not obtaining a
<hi>Licence;</hi> but no sooner were they secure of one than they
made the matter publick, and having read the Marriage Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts
before all the Company, they proceeded to appoint a
Day for the Solemnization. This was a cruel blow to poor
<hi>Ragotin</hi> whom <hi>Rancour</hi> whisper'd in the Ear, <hi>Did not I tell you
what this would come to? I had always mistrusted it.</hi> Hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:53808:168"/>
the poor little Man fell into a deep Melancholy, which
enclin'd him to that Despair which you may read of in the
last Chapter of this <hi>Romance.</hi> He became so disorder'd that
while he was walking one Holy-day before the great Church
of <hi>Notre-dame,</hi> at the time of the Ringing of the Bells, he
fancied that they were made to Ring the following Words on
purpose to affront him,

                  <p>This made him to go immediately into the Belfry and
rattle the Sexton, telling him he ly'd, for that he had not
drunk so much as he imagined. <hi>But,</hi> quoth he, <hi>I should not

                     <hi>for then I should have rejoiced to have found inanimate Bodies

deserv'd! I will be reveng'd of you and your Bells if possible.</hi>
Having said this, and crowded on his Hat fast to his Head, he
mounted up a pair of winding Stairs which he thought went
up to the place where they were Ringing, but which were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the Stairs belonging to the Organ. When he began to
perceive that this was not the Belfry Stair-Case, he was
somewhat troubled; nevertheless going on forwards, he at
length met with a little low Door which went under the Tiles.
Here he crept in; and whereas other People would have been
forc'd to creep on, by reason of the low pitch of the place,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>he nevertheless afterwards had room to walk upright, when

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t last coming to another Door that open'd into the Ringing-Room
he went in and found several Persons at it <hi>Ding-dong</hi>
with that eagerness that they never look'd behind them. At
his first entrance he saluted the Fellow that stood next him
with all the injurious Language he could think of, calling him
<hi>

which notwithstanding the noise of the Bells hindred that

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>he said Fellow and gave him a good lusty thump on the

                        <desc>•</desc>

turn'd about of a sudden and cry'd, <hi>What little T—<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

this?—I wonder who sent thee hither to strike me. Rage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi>
was about to have given him the Reason for what he had
done, when the Ringer holding his Bell-rope with one Hand,
and catching him by the Arm with the other twirl'd him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout,
and at the same time gave him such a kick in the
A—e that he sent him headlong down a pair of Stairs into
the Chim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>-room. He tumbled so violently, with his Face fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
against some of the Clock-work, that his Nose gus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>d
out with Blood, besides the many other parts of his Body
that were extremely Bruiz'd. This made him to roar like a
Bull; but perceiving no Remedy, and fearing to go up again
to the Ringer, he ran down Stairs as fast as he could drive
to complain to the Lieutenant Criminal who lived hard by.
This Magistrate seeing <hi>Ragotin</hi> in that pickle, was easily
enclin'd to believe what he told him, but after having heard
the reason likewise, from the Sexton that followed him to his
House, he could not forbear laughing immoderately, tho' he
pity'd him at the same time, well knowing that the little Man
must needs have his Brain out of order to be guilty of such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancies.
Nevertheless to content him what he could, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

But that indeed after he had once struck him first he did ki<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     <pb n="341" facs="tcp:53808:169"/>
and Monsieur <hi>Garrouffiere</hi> to laugh heartily at him.
The Wedding-day being at length come, the <hi>Prior</hi> of St.
<hi>Lewis</hi> told the Parties to be Marryed, that he had made
choice of his own Church to Marry them in, whither they
went soon after, with as little noise as they could, and were
Marryed after a very pious Exhortation. The Business being
thus done, they returned to their Lodgings, where they Din'd,
after which they did not know how to pass their time till
Supper. As for Plays, Enterludes, and <hi>Balls,</hi> they had been so
familiar to them, that they were not at all entertaining, and
therefore they propos'd to hear some <hi>Novel</hi> read. <hi>Verville</hi>
said for his part he knew none. If <hi>Ragotin</hi> had not been
Melancholy, he had been the properest Person to relate one, but
he was dumb. Then <hi>Rancour</hi> was spoke to to tell that of the
Poet <hi>Roquebrune,</hi> which he had promis'd the Company he
would do when occasion serv'd, and none could happen bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than novv. His answer was, that he was not at all in
Humour, and besides, that he did not care to bespatter his
Friend <hi>Roquebrune</hi> with Aspersions, since he had better de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
of him of late then he had formerly done. At length
Monsieur <hi>de la Garrouffiere</hi> told the Company, that if they
would accept of what he could entertain them with, he would
tell them some Adventures which he had been an Eye-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of, and which you will find in the following Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>

                  <p>
                     <q>MY Father, who was a Councellor of the Parliament of
<hi>Rennes, said Monsieur</hi> de la Garrouffiere, and who
design'd me for his Successor, as I am, sent me to the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege
to qualifie me for that purpose. But whilst I continu'd
in my own Country he fancyed I profited but little, and
therefore he resolved to send me to <hi>la Fleche,</hi> where you
know the Jesuites have their best College throughout all
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:53808:170"/>
                        <hi>France.</hi> It was in this little Tovvn that vvhat I am about to tell
you hapned, and moreover at the same time that I Studied
there.—There were tvvo Gentlemen, the most accomplish'd
in all that Place, vvho altho' they vvere a little advanc'd in
Years, were nevertheless not Marry'd, as it often happens a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
Persons of any Quality, vvho according to the Proverb,
<hi>Between whom we would have, and whom we would not, we remain
a long time unmarried.</hi> This Saying vvas nevertheless cross'd
at last by these tvvo vvell Bred Gentlemen. One of these, vvho
vvas called Monsieur <hi>de Fons-blanche,</hi> Married a Daughter of
the Family of <hi>Chateau-d'un,</hi> vvho vvere a meaner sort of Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
but very Rich. The other vvhose Name vvas Monsieur <hi>du
Lac,</hi> Marry'd a Lady from the City of <hi>Chartres,</hi> who was not
Rich, but nevertheless exceeding Beautiful, and of so good a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
that she vvas related to several Dukes, and Peers,
and Mareshals of <hi>France.</hi> These tvvo Gentlemen, vvho could
share the Tovvn betvvixt them, vvere alvvays good Friends
till after their Marriage, vvhen their tvvo Ladies looking
enviously on each other, they quickly occasion'd a Rupture
betvveen the Husbands. Madam <hi>de Fons-blanche,</hi> vvas nor,
'tis true, Handsome in Countenance, but she had neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
a graceful Mein, vvas vvell shap'd, had a great deal of
Wit, and vvas very obliging. Madam <hi>du Lac,</hi> as Beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
as she vvas, yet vvanted Address; she had Wit indeed
a great deal, but so ill Manag'd, that she thereby rather
render'd herself avoidable than acceptable. These tvvo La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
vvere of the Humour of most Women novv a days,
vvho never think they live great, unless they have a Score
or tvvo of <hi>Beaux</hi> after them. This caus'd them to employ
all the Art they had in making Conquests, but herein <hi>du
Lac</hi> succeeded much better than <hi>Fons-blanche,</hi> for she had sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
all the Youth of the Tovvn, I mean among the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
for she vvould by no means suffer any others to speak
to her. This Pride and Affectation, occasion'd a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Murmurings against her, vvhich at length broke out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
open detraction, but nothing harm'd her, for it is thought
it rather contributed to, than hinder'd her procuring nevv
Lovers. <hi>Fons-blanche</hi> vvas not so desirous of having a great
number of Sparks. She nevertheless had some, which she
manag'd with a great deal of Address, and vvhereof there
vvas one, a very handsome young Fellovv, vvho had as
much Wit as she, and vvas one of the bravest Youths of
his time. This Spark vvas her greatest Favourite, but at
length his diligence caus'd him to be suspected by the
Neighbours, and Slander began to talk loud. It was here
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:53808:170"/>
the Rupture began between the two Ladies, who before,
had Visited each other very civilly, but nevertheless with a
little jealous Envy. <hi>Du Lac</hi> began at last to slander <hi>Fons
Blanche</hi> openly; to spy into her Actions, and do all that
lay in her power to ruine her Reputation, especially about
the aforesaid Gentleman, whose Name was Monsieur <hi>du
Val-Rochet.</hi> This soon came to <hi>Fons-blanche</hi>'s Ears, who
was extremely nettled at it, and said, that if she had Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
it was not by Scores as <hi>du Las</hi> had, who every Day
gain'd new Conquests by her Impostures. <hi>Du Lac</hi> hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this, quickly return'd her the like Reflections. Whence
you may imagine, that these two Women liv'd together in
a Town like a Brace of Daemons. Some charitable Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
did all they could to reconcile them, but which prov'd
in vain, for they could never be prevail'd upon so much
as to see each other. <hi>Du Lac</hi> thought, that the only way
to offend <hi>Fons-blanche</hi> to the quick, would be to get away
her Lover <hi>du Val-Rochet</hi> from her. She then caus'd Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>de Fons-blanche,</hi> to be acquainted under-hand, that he
was no sooner out of Doors, which he was often, either a
Hunting or a Visiting his Neighbours, but that <hi>du Val-Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chet</hi>
lay with his Wife; and farther, that several Persons of
Credit were ready to testifie, that they had seen him come
naked out of her Bed. Monsieur <hi>de Fons-blanche,</hi> who
had never yet had any suspition of his Wife, was never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless
inclinable to reflect a little upon what he had heard,
and in confusion, desir'd his Lady to oblige him so far, as
to entertain <hi>du Val-Rochet</hi>'s Visits no longer. She seem'd
all Obedience, but nevertheless insinuated so many Reasons
why she might safely admit him, that he gave her Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and suffer'd her to Act as before. <hi>Du Lac</hi> perceiving
that this Contrivance of hers had not had its desir'd ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
resolv'd to get some opportunity to talk with <hi>Val-Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chet</hi>
herself. She was both Fair and Subtle, two Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications
that were sufficient to surprize the waryest Heart,
altho' it had been never so much engag'd. <hi>De Fons-blanche</hi>
was extremely concern'd, at being like to lose her Lover,
but much more when she heard, that <hi>Val-Rochet</hi> had spoke
unhandsomely of her. This Grief of hers was augmented
by her Husband's Death, which hapned a little while after.
She went into close Mourning 'tis true, but Jealousie got
the Ascendant of her outward concern. Her Husband had
been scarce Buried 15 Days, but she had a secret Confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
with <hi>Val Rochet.</hi> I know not the Subject of their
Discourse, but the Event makes me pretty well able to guess
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:53808:171"/>
at it, for in little more than a Week after, their Marriage
was made publick, so that in less than a Months time, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>
had two Husbands, a Living and a dead. This seems to
me, to have been the most violent effect of Jealousie im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginable,
for to deprive <hi>du Lac</hi> of her Lover, she both
forfeited her Modesty by Marrying so soon, and forgave the
unpardonable Affront <hi>Val-Rochet</hi> had offer'd her. <hi>Du Lac</hi>
was almost ready to run Mad when she first heard this
News, and resolv'd forthwith to have him Assassinated as
he went on a Journey to <hi>Britany,</hi> but which he having been
acquainted with, she was prevented in that Design. Then
she enter'd upon the strangest thought that ever Jealousie
could suggest, and that was, to set her Husband and <hi>Val-Rochet</hi>
together by the Ears, which she brought about by
her pernicious Artifices. They quarrell'd divers times, and
at length came to a Duel, which <hi>du Lac</hi> encourag'd her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
in, being none of the wisest Men in the World, that
<hi>du Val-Rochet</hi> might have an opportunity to kill him, which
she fancyed no hard matter, and then she propos'd to Hang
him out of the way for his pains. But as Fortune would
have it, it hapned quite otherwise, for <hi>Val Rochet</hi> trusting
to his skill in Fencing, seem'd to dispise <hi>du Lac,</hi> thinking
he durst not make a Thrust at him, but herein he was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
deceiv'd, for whilst he put himself out of guard,
<hi>du Lac</hi> made a home Thrust at him, and run him thro' the
Body, whereof he instantly dyed. This done, <hi>du Lac</hi> went
home to his House, and acquainted his Wife therewith, who
was not only surpriz'd but concern'd at so unexpected an
Accident. He after this fled away privately to a Relation
of his Wives, who as I have told you before, had several
Persons of Quality to her Kindred, who labour'd incessant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to obtain her Husbands Pardon from the King. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
<hi>Fons-blanche</hi> was not a little astonish'd when she was first
told that her Husband was kill'd, but coming afterwards to
herself, she was advised to Bury him quickly and private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
to prevent his Body being Arrested by the Bailiffs. Thus
in less than six Weeks time, <hi>Fons-blanche</hi> had been a Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
twice. <hi>Du Lac</hi> not long after obtain'd his Pardon,
which was confirmed by the Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all the opposition the deceas'd Person's Widow could make.
This made her to entertain a wilder Design than Madam <hi>du
Lac</hi> had done before, and that was to Stab <hi>du Lac</hi> as he
walked in the Market-place with some of his Friends. For
this purpose she provided herself of a Ponyard, and march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up to him, attackt him so furiously, that before he
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:53808:171"/>
could get himself into a Posture of Defence, or have any
of his Friends turn about to help him, she had Stabb'd
him mortally in two Places, vvhereof he died three Days
after. His Wife immediately got this Virago seiz'd and
clapt up in Prison. Her Tryal came on, and she was Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd
to Die, but her Execution was respited, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of her being with Child, nevertheless, not long after
the Stench of the Prison did the Work of the Hang-man,
for she dyed of a Disease caus'd thereby, after having been
first delivered before her time, and her Child being Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiz'd
died likewise soon after. Madam <hi>du Lac</hi> began after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
to reflect on what she had been the occasion of, and
therefore forthwith resolv'd to turn Nun, which she did,
after having put her Affairs in order, in the Nunnery of
<hi>Almeneche,</hi> in the Diocess of <hi>Sées,</hi> where she now conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues,
if she be not yet dead of her Austerities which she
voluntarily inflicted on her self.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Actors and Actresses countinu'd their Attention, even
while Monsieur <hi>de la Garrouffiere</hi> had done speaking, so well
they lik'd the Story he had entertain'd them with. <hi>Roque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brune</hi>
starting up all of a sudden, told the Company, after his
usual way, that this was a rare Subject for a Grave Poem,
and he would make an excellent Tragedy of it, which he
would reduce to Dramatick Rules. The Company took
little notice of what he said, but all admir'd at the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Courage of the Women, who being push'd on by Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie,
did not boggle at the most hazardous Attempts. Then
it was Disputed, whether Jealousie were a Passion or not, and
all concluded, that whatsoever it was, it ruin'd the Noblest
of Passions <hi>Love.</hi> There was a good while yet to Supper,
when all the Company agreed to go and Walk in the Park, which
they did, and afterwards sat themselves down on the Grass.
Then <hi>Destiny</hi> said, he thought nothing so pleasant as <hi>Novels.</hi>
which <hi>Leander</hi> confirming, offer'd to relate another concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Neighbour's Daughter of his, which was accepted, and
after three or four times Coughing, he began as follows.</p>

                  <head type="sub">The Capricious Lady, a Novel.</head>
                  <p>
                     <q>THere liv'd in a small Town of <hi>Britany</hi> call'd <hi>Vitray</hi> an
ancient Gentleman who had been Married a great while
to a very virtuous Lady without having any Children by her.
Amongst other Houshold-Servants he had a Steward and a
Housekeeper, thro' whose Hands most matters relating to
the Family passed. These two Persons, as most Servants do
sooner or later, made Love, and promiss'd each other Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.
They had so well play'd their Parts in their several
Stations, that both the good old Gentleman and his Lady
died not long after very much incumber'd. As for the two
Servants they became Rich and Married, having little or no
regard to their Masters Misfortune. Some Years afterwards
a certain ill Accident fell out that caused the Steward to
fly his Country, and which to do the more securely, he listed
himself in a Troop of Horse, leaving his Wife without
Children. She having waited for his return about two Years
and hearing nothing of him, caus'd a Report to be spread
abroad that he was Dead, and accordingly went into Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for him. When this was a little over, she was sought
after by several Persons in Marriage, and among the rest by
a rich Merchant who marry'd her, and at the Years end had
a Child by her, who might be about four Years old when
her Mothers first Husband return'd home to his House. To
tell you which was the most surpriz'd, the two Husbands
or the Wife, is not in my Power, but certain it is, that the
first Husbands occasion of going away still continuing against
him, he was easily prevail'd upon by the other Husband to
take a small sum of Money to be gone again. 'Tis true
he every now and then return'd secretly for a little Subsistance
from his Wife, which was not refus'd him. In the mean
time the Daughter, whose Name was <hi>Margaret,</hi> grew up,
and being Rich, tho' she was not handsome, did not want
for Sparks to Court her. Among the rest was a rich Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
Son, who did not mind his Fathers Business, but lov'd
to frequent Gentries Company, where he often met with
his Mistress <hi>Margaret,</hi> who was received among them on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:53808:172"/>
of her Riches. This young Man, whose Name was
Monsieur <hi>de St. Germain,</hi> had a good Countenance and Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
enough to engage him often in Duels, which at that
time were very frequent. He Danc'd very gracefully, Gam'd
with all the better sort of Company, and was always well
drest. In the many meetings he had with this young Lass, he
took all opportunities to let her know what a kindness he had
for her, and how desirous he was to be her Husband. This
she seem'd to approve of well enough, and consequently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited
him to come and see her at home, which he did by
permission of her Father and Mother, who extremely fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
the Match. But afterwards, when he was about to
ask her of her Parents, he would by no means do it till
he had her consent likewise, not believing when she had
yeilded so far in other things she would oppose him in that,
but to his great surprize, upon putting the Question to her,
he found her to repulse him furiously, both in Words and
Actions. Hereupon he went his way, and forbore visiting her
for five or six Days, hoping that thereby he might in some
measure abate his Passion, but to his disappointment he found
that it had taken too deep root to be so easily remov'd, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that he was quickly forc'd to go see her again. He
had no sooner enter'd her House but she went out of it among
her Companions in the Neighbourhood, and whither he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
her, after having had a promise from her Father and
Mother to do their endeavours to make her more sociable.
This nevertheless they durst not attempt to do with rigour,
she being their Darling and only Daughter, and therefore
they chose rather to represent to her mildly what Injustice
she did the young Man, to use him so ill, after having once
profess'd to love him. To this she gave no Answer, and
notwithstanding all was said, continu'd still in her ill Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
for whenever he offer'd to come near her she would
change her place. Then he would follow her, but she always
flew from him. One Day as she was getting away he caught
her by the Sleeve; she told him he rumpled it, and that if he
offer'd to come near her any more she would give him a box
o'th'Ear. In a Word, the more he follow'd her the more she
avoided him. When she was at the Ball, and he would have
danced with her, she affronted. him, telling him she was out
of order, and at the same time danc'd with another. She at
length arriv'd to that pitch of Ill-nature that she occasion'd
him Quarrels, and he above four times accepted Challenges
upon her account, in all which Duels he nevertheless came
off safe, which she seem'd to be very sorry for. All this ill
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:53808:173"/>
usage did but enflame his Passion the more, like as Oyl
thrown upon the Fire, insomuch that his Visits were made
the more frequently for his being discourag'd. One Day
above the rest he fancy'd his Perseverance had wrought an
alteration in her, for that she suffer'd him to come near her,
and seem'd to hearken attentively to what he said to her.
His Language was this, Why do you thus fly from me, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensible
Fair one! that cannot live without you? If I have not
Merit sufficient to deserve you, yet consider at least the excess
of my Passion, and the many Indignities I have born from
you with Patience.</q> 
                     <hi>Very well,</hi> answer'd she, <hi>you may flatter your
self with that Fancy if you please, but I would have you to know
that the best way for you to win upon me, is to get as far out
of my sight as you can, and because you cannot well do it as long as
you continue in this Town, I command you, which if you have that
respect you pretend for me you will obey me in, to list your self in
the Troops that are now raising, and after you have made a few
Campagnes it may be you may find me more kind. This small
pittance of Hope which I afford you ought to encline you to obey
me, but if you will not do it lose me for ever.</hi> Then she drew
off a Ring from her Finger and gave it him, saying <hi>Keep this
Ring to put you in mind of me, but remember that I forbid you
to come any more tho' to take your leave of me.</hi> 
                     <q>This said, she suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
him to take a parting Kiss of her, and then went into
an adjoining Chamber locking her self in. Then this wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Lover went to take leave of her Father and Mother,
who pity'd him extremely, promising to continue always his
Friends, and next Day he listed in a Troop of Horse that was
raising to go to the Siege of <hi>Rochelle.</hi> His Mistress having
enjoin'd him not to see her again, till after his return, he
durst not pretend to attempt it; but however the Night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his Departure he gave her a Serenade under her Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
with this Complaint at the end of it, which he Sung
to the Melancholly strains of his Lute.</q>

                     <q>The capricious Creature at the sound of this Serenade got out
of her Bed, and opening the Shutters of the Window peep'd
thro' the Glass, and set up so hearty a Laugh as might well
make the poor Lover think that he was not like to succeed
in his Design.</q> Just as he was about to express his Mind far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
she clapt to the Shutter, crying out to him aloud, <hi>Keep
your Promise, Sir, for your own sake, and it may be I may not
be worse than mine.</hi> 
                     <q>With this Answer poor <hi>St. Germain</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir'd,
and a few Days afterwards set out with his Troop for
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:53808:174"/>
the Siege of <hi>Rochelle.</hi> This Town as you may have heard,
held out very obstinately for some time, till at length it
was forc'd to surrender upon Discretion. Then it was that
the Troop wherein <hi>St.</hi> Germain rid was disbanded, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
to <hi>Vitray.</hi> He no sooner arriv'd but he went to wait
on his unkind Mistress <hi>Margaret,</hi> who permitted him 'tis true
to Salute her, but afterwards told him that he had return'd
too soon, and that she was not yet dispos'd to receive him,
and therefore desir'd him to be gone again. His Answer
was in these mournful Words,</q> 
                     <hi>You are certainly the most cruel
Person of your Sex, and I plainly perceive that you desire nothing
more than the Death of him that has approv'd himself the most
faithful Lover in the World. You have put me four times upon
single Trials of my Courage, and I have always had Honourable
Escapes. You then would have me hazard my Life in the Army,
and I have come off safe there, even where many a less unhappy
Wretch than I has met his end. But since I find you so ardent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
covet my Ruin, I will go seek my Fate in so many places
that it shall be out of Fortunes Power to afford me any Escape;
but it may be you will not be able to forbear repenting of having
occasion'd this, since my Death shall be of that kind as will not
only surprize but encline you to pity me. Adieu! then,</hi> added
he, <hi>most Cruel of your Sex, Adieu for ever!</hi> 
                     <q>Having utter'd
these Words, he was rising to be gone, but which she would
not suffer till she had told him that she did not by any
means desire his Death, and that what she had done to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
him in Duels was only to be the better convinc'd of
his Courage, that he might be the more worthy of her. And
lastly she let him know that she was not yet dispos'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
his Addresses, but that time, for ought she knew, might
make an alteration upon her to his Advantage. With these
Words she left him and retir'd. The small Hopes she gave
him put him upon a Stratagem which was like to have
spoil'd all, and that was to make her Jealous. He consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
with himself that since she had shew'd some good Will
towards him, she would not fail to be Jealous if she really
lov'd him. He therefore sought out a Comrade of his that
had a Mistress that lov'd him as much as his slighted him.
He desir'd him to give him leave to make his Addresses to
her and he to do the like to his, that he might observe how
she would take it. His Comrade would by no means
grant his request till he had his Mistresses consent, which
nevertheless soon after demanding, he easily obtain'd. The
first time that these two Ladies came together, which I should
have told you they did almost every Day, the two Lovers
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:53808:174"/>
made their exchange according to Agreement, <hi>St. Germain</hi>
stepping up to and Courting his Comrades Mistress, whilst
his Comrade did the like to the Haughty <hi>Margaret,</hi> who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
him but very coldly. But assoon as she perceived
her former Spark and his Mistress laugh'd, she began to fly
out into a great Passion, well knowing then that this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
had been concerted on Agreement, and therefore im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
flung out of the Company with Tears in her Eyes.
This caused the obliging Mistress to go after her and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to appease her, telling her that this Stratagem of her
Lovers was only to know her Mind the better, and not to
circumvent or affront her, and therefore earnestly entreated
her to take no farther notice of it, but rather to favour the
constant Addresses of so sincere a Lover as <hi>St. Germain</hi> had
long been to her. All this notwithstanding gain'd little up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the humoursom <hi>Margaret;</hi> whereupon the unfortunate <hi>St.
Germain</hi> was driven to so fierce a despair that for the future
he fought nothing so much as to shew the violence of his
Love by some rash Action, which he hop'd might procure
his Death. This Resolution one Night, not long after, he
had an occasion to put in Practice, for whilst he and Seven
of his Comrades were coming out of a Tavern half Drunk,
and with their Swords by their sides, they chanc'd to meet
three or four Gentlemen, amongst whom was a Captain of
Horse. With these they began to dispute the Wall, and
which they obtain'd by being the greater number, but the
Gentlemen returning immediately after with four or five
more of their Company, they pursued these Persons that had
so greatly Affronted them, and overtook them in the High-Street,
when <hi>St. Germain</hi> being the foremost, and having been
the forwardest in the Affront, the Captain discovering him
to be a Trooper by his Hat, stept up to him and gave him
such a lusty blow with a Back-Sword that he cut thro' his
Hat and cleft part of his Scull. Having done this, and
thinking themselves sufficiently reveng'd, the Captain and his
Companions march'd off, leaving <hi>St. Germain</hi> for dead in the
Arms of his Friends. He had little or no Pulse left, and less
Motion, insomuch that they immediately carried him home,
and sent for several Surgeons, who found Life yet remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in him. These drest his Wound, stitch'd up his Scull
and then bound it up. The noise of this Contest had at first
allarm'd the Neighbourhood; but they were much more sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd
when they heard a Man had been so dangerously wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
The thing was talk'd about from one to t'other after a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
manner, but however all concluded that St. <hi>Germain</hi> was
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:53808:175"/>
a Dead Man. This Report quickly got to his cruel Mistres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
House, who tho' undrest, yet immediately ran to see him,
and whom she found in the condition I have told you. As
soon as she saw Death begin to show its self in his Face she
fell down in a Swoon, and it was found no easy matter to
recover her. When she came to her self the Neighbours be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to accuse her of being the Cause of this disaster, and
that if she had not been so unkind to him he would never
have been so desperately rash, this being but the result
of what he had frequently threaten'd. Then began she
to tear her Hair, wring her Hands, and do all that Mad
People are wont to do. She afterwards proceeded to serve
him with that diligence that all the time of his Illness she
would neither undress her self nor lye down on the Bed, not
permit any of his Sisters to do any thing about him. After
he came to himself, and began to know People, it was judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
necessary that she should absent herself, which she was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless
with great difficulty prevail'd on to do. He at
length was cur'd, and when he came to be perfectly well he
was Married to his capricious Mistress <hi>Margaret,</hi> to the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
of every body, but much more of himself.</q> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>Leander</hi> had finish'd this <hi>Novel,</hi> the Company return'd to the
Town, where having well Supp'd, Danc'd and the like, they
put the new marry'd Couples to Bed. These Weddings had
been kept so secret that they had no Visitors for two Days
after, but on the third Day they were so embarras'd with them
that they had not leisure left them to Study their Parts. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a little time they all continu'd their Exercise as before ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
<hi>Ragotin,</hi> who was fallen into a perfect Despair, as you
will find in the following Chapter.</p>

                     <hi>This is fine indeed,</hi> quoth <hi>Rancour, but you will never have
the satisfaction to read it on your Tomb, for it is the common
Opinion that dead People neither see nor understand any thing
of what we do that survive them.</hi> 
                     <q>Ah! <hi>answer'd</hi> Ragotin, you
have partly been the cause of my Misfortunes, for you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
gave me hopes I should succeed, and yet I am very
well assur'd you all along knew the contrary.</q> Then <hi>Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour</hi>
protested to him that he knew nothing certainly of it,
but confess'd that he had always suspected it as he had
told him before, when he had advis'd him to stifle his Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
she being the proudest Woman in the World. <hi>But me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks,</hi>
added he, <hi>her Profession of a</hi> Stroller, <hi>which you know
is none of the most Honourable Employments, might have some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
abated her Self-conceit, yet it has always so happen'd that
these sort of Women take much more upon them than belongs
to them. But at length,</hi> continu'd he, <hi>I must discover some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to you that I have kept a secret till now, and that is,
That I was as much in Love with Madam</hi> Star <hi>as you, and I
know not how a Person that had so much Conversation as I had
with her could have well avoided it; but now that I find my
self out of hopes as well as you, I am resolv'd to leave the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
especially since Mrs.</hi> Caves <hi>Brother is come into it, who can
Act all those Parts that I did, and therefore I believe they will
be the more willing to part with me. I will then go to</hi> Rennes
<hi>where the other Company is, and whereinto I do not question but I
shall be receiv'd, because that they at present want an Actor,</hi>

But <hi>Rancour</hi> Swore like a Devil that he was a Man of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and had done all that in him lay to promote his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest,
but said he could never prevail to be heard. <hi>Well then</hi>

and therefore took no care to prevent his doing himself any
harm. As for the Epitaph he never spoke of it to any body
but the Poet <hi>Roquebrune,</hi> to whom at his request he gave a
Copy. When <hi>Ragotin</hi> was alone he began to think what me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
he should make use of to rid himself out of the World.
He took a Pistol and charg'd it with a brace of Bullets to
shoot himself thro' the Head, but then he was affraid that way
would make too much noise. Then he took the point of
his Sword and put it against his Breast, but assoon as he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <pb n="355" facs="tcp:53808:176"/>
it prick it made him Sick, and therefore that method was
rejected. At last he went down into the Stable, where whilst
the Hostlers were at Breakfast, he took one of the Halters that
he found lying there, and fasten'd one end of it to the Rack,
and put the other with a Noose about his Neck, but when he
was about to let himself swing, he found he had not the Heart to
do it, and therefore waited till somebody came in when he
was resolv'd upon it. At length a Gentleman came and
then he let go the hold of his Hands, but still kept one Foot
bearing on the Manger. However he might have been strang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
had he continu'd so hanging for any while. The Boy
that went to put up the Gentleman's Horse seeing <hi>Ragotin</hi>
hang in that manner, thought verily he had been dead, and
therefore he began to bawl out like Mad for help. All
the Family came down, and seeing a Man hang'd, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
took the Rope from his Neck, and brought him to him
self, which you may imagine was not very easy to do.
Then he was ask'd what made him enter upon so strange
a Resolution, but no answer could be got from him Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
<hi>Rancour</hi> took Madam <hi>Star</hi> aside, whom I might
have call'd by the name of <hi>Destiny,</hi> but being so near to the
end of this Romance it will be scarce worth while, and
told her the occasion as he believed of this strange Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking.
She seem'd much surpriz'd at it, but was much
more when she heard this wicked Man tell her that he was
still in the same mind to make away with himself, but
would not attempt it any more by a Halter. To this <hi>Star</hi>
answer'd not one Word, whereupon <hi>Ragotin</hi> took his leave and
departed. Some little time after he made known to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
a design he had to accompany Monsieur <hi>Verville</hi> to <hi>Mans.</hi>
The Company was willing enough to part with him as long
as he had a Companion, but would not have car'd to trust
him alone. Next Morning they set out betimes, after that
Monsieur <hi>Verville</hi> had made a thousand Protestations of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd
Friendship to the Actors and Actresses, but especially to
<hi>Destiny,</hi> whom he embrac'd, professing the great Joy he had
to see his designs accomplish'd. <hi>Ragotin</hi> made a long Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangue
by way of Compliment, but which was so confus'd
that I don't think fit to insert it. When they were ready
to go <hi>Verville</hi> enquir'd if the Horses had drank. The Hostler told
him it was too soon in the Morning, but he might let them
do it on the Road if he pleased. Then having taken leave
of Monsieur <hi>de la Garrouffiere,</hi> they mounted and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.
Monsieur <hi>de la Garrouffiere</hi> mounted likewise to go
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:53808:177"/>
Home, whom the new Married Couples return'd abundance
of Acknowledgments to, for coming so far to honour their
Nuptials with his presence. After a hundred Protestations of
Service on both sides, he set out, and <hi>Rancour</hi> followed him,
who notwithstanding his Insensibiliiy could not forbear Weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
<hi>Destiny</hi> wept also, calling to mind the many Services
<hi>Rancour</hi> had done him, especially that upon the <hi>Pont-neus</hi> at
<hi>Paris,</hi> when he was there set upon and Robb'd by <hi>la Rappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niere</hi>
and his Followers. Assoon as <hi>Verville</hi> and <hi>Ragotin</hi> were
got to a River they immediately went therein to water their
Horses, but it was <hi>Ragotin's</hi> peculiar ill Fortune to light on
a place where the Bank had been cut down, which causing
his Horse to stumble, he threw the little Man violently over
his Head into the River, which was exceeding deep in that
part above others. Poor <hi>Ragotin</hi> knew not how to Swim,
and tho' he had, his Equipage of Carabine, Basket-hilt Sword,
and Cloak, would have sunk him in spite of his Teeth. One
of <hi>Verville</hi>'s Men immediately rode after <hi>Ragotin</hi>'s Horse to
catch him, whilst another stript himself and leap'd in after
the Master to save him, but found him Dead. Then Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
was call'd, and the Body taken out and laid on the Grass.
Next the <hi>Strollers</hi> were sent for, who mightily Condol'd poor
<hi>Ragotin</hi>'s Fate; which having done, they took him and Buried
him in St. <hi>Catharines</hi> Chappel, which is not very far from
this River. This dismal event nevertheless verified the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb,
<hi>That he that was born to be Hang'd would never be Drown'd.
Ragotin</hi> experienc'd the revers, for he could not strangle him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
and so might be Drown'd. Thus ended the Life and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures
of this little Comical Advocate, who shall be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
by the Inhabitants of <hi>Mans</hi> and <hi>Alençon</hi> as long as
they have any tast for <hi>Strolling,</hi> or relish for Stage-Plays. <hi>Roque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brune</hi>
seeing <hi>Ragotin</hi> in his Grave, said that his Epitaph
must be alter'd after the following manner.</p>

he was about twelve years old, and from that moment
might be called the thriftiest Page in the World, and the

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:53808:180"/>
said to be rich in Gray hairs, because by procuring him
the charity of well-disposed persons, they helpt to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
him. At last the old Gentleman troop't off, at which
his unrighteous Son rejoyc'd, fancying himself already en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched,
by that which his Father did not spend. From that
hour he enjoyn'd himself so severe and strict a sort of life, and
practis'd so wonderful a frugality, that he spent not a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of that little money his Master gave him to keep body
and soul together. It is true, he did this at the expence of
his Belly, which often grumbled at him for it, and of all
his acquaintance. <hi>Don Marcos</hi> (for that was our Hero's
name) was of a stature below the common pitch, and for
want of due repairing the decays of his little carcass, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
in a short time as slender as a Lath, and as dry as a
Deal-board. When he waited on his Master at Table, he
never took off a Plate with any Meat in it, but he dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously
whipt the best part into his pocket; and because it
could not so well contain Soops, and other liquids, he made
money of a great number of Torches ends, which he had
kept together with great industry, and bought him a pair
of Tin Pockets; by the help of which he soon began to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
miracles for the advancement of his fortune. Misers
are for the most part careful and vigilant, and these two
good qualities, joyn'd to the furious passion which <hi>Don Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cos</hi>
had to become rich, made his Master take such a fancy
to him, that he was resolved never to part with so excellent
a Page. For this reason he made him wear a Livery till he
was thirty years old. But at last this Phoenix of a Servant
being oblig'd to undergo the Tonsor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s hands too often, to
clear him of his ungodly beard, his Master metamorphos'd
our Page into a Gentleman, and thus made him that which Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
never design'd him to be. And now you must know his
revenues were augmented by the addition of several <hi>Reals</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day;
but instead of augmenting his expences, our Spark shut
his purse so much the closer, as his new employ, one would
have thought, might have obliged him the more to open it.
He had heard stories told him of some of his own profession,
who for want of a Valet would call up your fellows that cry
Brandy about the streets in a morning, to make their Beds,
and sweep their Chambers, under pretence of buying some
of their Liquor, and of others, who in the winter got them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
undrest at night by your Cryers of gray pease or Link-boys:
but as this was not to be done without some sort of
injustice, and our <hi>Don Marcos</hi> made a conscience of wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any one but himself, he thought it much better to shift
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:53808:180"/>
as well as he cou'd without a Valet. He never burnt an inch
of Candle in his Chamber, but what he stole, and to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
it with more Oeconomy, he began to unbutton him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in the Street at the very place where he lighted it, put
it out as soon as he got to his Lodgings. and so tumbled into
bed in the dark. But still finding that there was a cheaper
way of going to bed than this, his busie inventing Genius
set him upon making a hole in the Wall, which divided his
Room from that of his neighbour, who no sooner lighted his
Candle, but our Don immediately opened his hole, and by that
means received light enough to do any thing he had occasion
for. Being not able to dispense with himself from wearing
a Tilter at his Breech, by reason of his noble descent,
which required it of him, he clapt a Lath into a Scabboard,
wore it one day on the right, and the next on the left side,
in order to use his Breeches to some sort of Symmetry, and
because his trusty Whinyard wou'd wear them out the less,
being equally divided between the right and the left. At
break of day he stood at the Street-door, begging a Gods
name a cup of Water of every Tankard-bearer that passed by,
and thus furnished himself with water enough to serve him
several days. He wou'd often come into the common Hall,
where his Masters other Servants used to take their repasts,
and whatever he saw them eat, he was sure to commend it
to the Skies, to give him some sort of a privilege to taste
it. He never laid out a farthing in Wine, yet drank more
or less every day, either by sipping some of that which
was publickly cryed about the Streets, or stopping Porters
that were carrying it to the Taverns, whom he wou'd ask
to give him a taste of their Wine, that if he liked it, he might
know where to send for it. Once upon a time, riding to
<hi>Madrid</hi> upon a Mule, he so dexterously cheated the eyes
of his Innkeepers, that he fed trusty <hi>Dapple</hi> with the Straw
of the Beds, where he lay; but the very first day of his
journey, being weary of paying for his Servants dinner,
who was the first he ever had, he pretended that he cou'd
not drink his Landlords Wine, and sent the poor fellow to
find out better, a full league at least from the Inn where he
then was. The Servant accordingly beat the hoof thither,
relying upon his Masters Honour, who fairly gave him the
slip, and so the wretch was forced to beg all the way to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid.</hi>
In short, <hi>Don Marcos</hi> was the living picture of ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice
and filching, and was so well known to be the most co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>nto a Proverb, and they called a pinching miser a <hi>Don
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:53808:181"/>
Marcos.</hi> His master and all his friends told a thousand mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
stories of him, and even before his own face, because he
understood raillery to perfection, and wou'd stand a jest as
well as a managed Horse will stand fire. 'Twas an usual
saying with him, that no woman cou'd be handsom if she
loved to take, not ugly if she gave money, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hat a wise
man ought never to go to Bed, unless for the satisfaction of
his Conscience, he had turned the penny in the day time.
His excellent Theory, seconded by a most exact practice, had
brought him together, by that time he was forty years old,
above 10000 Crowns in Silver, a prodigious summ for a Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees
Gentleman to get, but especially in <hi>Spain.</hi> But what
may not a man save in the compass of many years, who
steals all that he can from himself and other people? <hi>Don
Marcos</hi> having the reputation to be rich, without being a
Debauchee or Gamester, was soon courted in marriage
by abundance of women, that love the money more than
the man, whose number in all parts of the world are great.
Among the rest that offered to carry the marriage yoke with
him, he met a woman whose name was <hi>Isidora,</hi> who passed
for a Widow, altho in truth she had never been married,
and appeared much younger than she was, by patching and
painting and tricking herself, in all which mysteries she
was skilled to admiration. The world judged of her wealth
by her way of living, which was expensive enough for a
Woman of her condition; and people who frequently guels
at random, and love to magnify matters, gave her at least
three thousand Livres a year, and some ten thousand
Crowns in Plate and Jewels, and the like convenient move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables.
The fellow that proposed her for a Wife to <hi>Don
Marcos,</hi> was a notable sharper, one that trucked in all sorts
of merchandize, but his principal subsistence was selling of
Maidenheads, and making of Matches. He spoke in such
advantageous terms of <hi>Isidora</hi> to <hi>Don Marcos,</hi> that he set
him upon the tenter-hooks to see this miracle, (a curiosity
he had never expressed for any woman before) and so
effectually perswaded our unthinking Cully, that she was
rich, and the Widow of a certain Cavalier, descended from
one of the best Families in <hi>Andalusia,</hi> that from that very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
he had an itch to be married to her. The same day
this proposal was made to him, our Marriage-pimp,
whose name was <hi>Gamara,</hi> came to call upon <hi>Don Marcos,</hi>
to introduce him into <hi>Isidora</hi>'s Company. Our covetous
Hunks was ravish'd to see the neatness and magnificence of
the House into which <hi>Gamara</hi> conducted him, but he was
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:53808:181"/>
much more so, when this Master of the Ceremonies assur'd
him that it belonged to <hi>Isidora.</hi> He was perfectly tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sported
at the richness of the Furniture, the Alcoves, and
Rooms of State, and a profusion of sweet Seems, that ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
seem'd proper for a Lady of the highest quality, than
for one that was to be the Wife of a Grandee's Gentleman
and no better; then as for the Mistress of this enchanted
Castle, he took her for a Goddess. <hi>Don Marcos</hi> found her
busy at work between a Damosel and a Chamber-maid,
both so beautiful and pretty, that whatever aversion he had
to expensive living, and a great number of Servants, he
resolved to marry <hi>Isidora,</hi> if it were only for the vanity to
be Master of two such charming Creatures. Whatever <hi>Isi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dora</hi>
said to him was utter'd so discreetly, that it not only
pleas'd, but perfectly ravish'd <hi>Don Marcos,</hi> and what contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
to make an entire conquest of his heart, was a collation
as nice as neatly serv'd in, where the clean Linnen and the
Silver Plate were all of a piece with the other rich Movea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
of the person that gave it. There sat down at this En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment,
a young Gentleman very well drest and
well made, whom <hi>Isidora</hi> pretended to be her Nephew.
His name was <hi>Angustine,</hi> but his good Aunt call'd him <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustinet,</hi>
altho the pretty Baby was above twenty years
old. <hi>Isidora</hi> and <hi>Augustinet</hi> strove who shou'd make <hi>Don
Marcos</hi> most welcome, and during the repast helpt him to
all the choicest bits; and while our trusty Miser laid about
him like a <hi>Harpy,</hi> and cramm'd his half-starv'd Guts with
Victuals enough to last him eight days, his ears were
charm'd by the melodious voice of the Damosel <hi>Marcella,</hi>
who sung two or three passionate airs to her Harpsicord.
<hi>Don Marcos</hi> lost no time, but fell on like a Devil, it being
at another's expence, and the Collation ended with the
day, whose light was supplied by that of four large Candles
in Silver Sconces, of admirable workmanship and weight,
which <hi>Don Marcos</hi> at that moment designed within him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to reform into one single Lamp, so soon as he was mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd
to <hi>Isidora. Augustinet</hi> took a Guittar and plaid several
Sarabands and Tunes, to which that cunning Jilt <hi>Marcella,</hi>
and <hi>Inez</hi> the Chamber-maid danced admirably well, strik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Castanietta's exactly to the time of the Guittar.
The discreet <hi>Gamara</hi> whispered <hi>Don Marcos</hi> in the ear, that
<hi>Isidora</hi> never sat up late, but went early to Bed, which
hint our civil Gentleman took immediately, and rising
from his Seat, made her a thousand Compliments and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testations
of Love, more than he had ever done to any Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:53808:182"/>
before, wish'd her and the little <hi>Augustinet</hi> a good
night, and left them at liberty by themselves to talk of him
what they thought. <hi>Don Marcos,</hi> who was up to the ears
in love with <hi>Isidora,</hi> but much more with her Money, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested
to <hi>Gamara,</hi> who accompanied him to his Lodgings,
that the charming Widow had intirely gain'd his affections,
and that he wou'd give one of his Fingers with all his Soul,
that he were already marry'd to her, because he never saw
a woman more made to his mind than she, altho in sober
truth he confessed, that after Marriage he wou'd retrench
somewhat of that endless ostentation and luxury. She lives
more like a Princess than the Wife of a private man, cries
the prudent <hi>Don Marcos</hi> to the dislembling <hi>Gamara;</hi> and she
does not consider, continued he, that the moveables she
has, being t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rned into money, and this money being joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to mine, we may be able to purchase a pretty handsome
Estate, which by Gods blessing, and my own industry, may
make a considerable Fortune for the Children Providence
shall give us. And if our Marriage is without issue, since
<hi>Isidora</hi> has a Nephew, we will leave him all we have, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
I like his behaviour, and find him no way addicted
to ill Husbandry. <hi>Don Marcos</hi> entertained <hi>Gamara</hi> with
these Discourses, or something of the like nature, when he
found himself before his own door. <hi>Gamara</hi> took leave of
him, after he had given him his word that next morning
he should conclude his Marriage with <hi>Isidora,</hi> because,
says he, affairs of this nature are as soon broke off by delays,
as by the death of either of the parties. <hi>Don Marcos</hi> em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced
his worthy Marriage-jobber, who went to give <hi>Isi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dora</hi>
an account in what disposition of mind he left her Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.
In the mean time our Amorous Coxcomb takes an end
of a Candle out of his Pocket, fixes it to the point of his
Sword, and having lighted it at a lamp, which burnt before
the publick Crucifix hard by, not without dropping a few
hearty Ejaculations for good success in his affair, he open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the door of the House where he lodged, and repaired to
his wretched bed, rather to think of his Amour than to
sleep. <hi>Gamara</hi> came to visit him the next morning, and
brought him the agreeable news that his business was done
with <hi>Isidora,</hi> who wholly left it to his discretion to appoint
the day of Marriage. Our besotted Lover told <hi>Gamara</hi>
that he was upon thorns till it was over, and that if he were
to be marry'd that very day, it would not be so soon as he
wished. <hi>Gamara</hi> reply'd, that it lay solely in his own pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to conclude it when he pleas'd, and <hi>Don Marcos</hi> embrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:53808:182"/>
him, conjur'd him to use all his diligence to get the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
dispatch'd that very day. He appointed <hi>Gamara</hi> to
give him the meeting after Dinner, while he went to his
Master's Levee, and waited on him at Table. Both of 'em met
exactly at the time of assignation, and then immediately went
to <hi>Isidora</hi>'s house, who received them much better than
the day before. <hi>Marcella</hi> sung, <hi>Inez</hi> danced, <hi>Augustinet</hi>
play'd upon the Guittar, and <hi>Isidora</hi> the principal Actress
of this Farce gave her Spouse that was to be a noble repast,
for which she knew well enough how to make herself full
amends afterwards. <hi>Gamara</hi> brought a Notary, who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
was a counterfeit one. The Articles of Marriage were
sign'd and seal'd. It was proposed to <hi>Don Marcos</hi> to play
a Game at <hi>Primera</hi> to pass away the time. Heavens bless
me, cry'd the astonish'd <hi>Don Marcos,</hi> I serve a Master who
wou'd not let me live a quarter of an hour with him, if he
knew I was a Gamester; but God be praised, I don't so
much as know the Cards. How much does it delight me,
replies <hi>Isidora,</hi> to hear Signior <hi>Don Marcos</hi> talk after this
manner? I daily preach the same Doctrine to my Nephew
<hi>Augustinet,</hi> but your young Fellows are not a farthing the
better for all the good advice that is given them. Go, fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish
obstinate Boy, says she to <hi>Augustinet,</hi> go and bid <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cella</hi>
and <hi>Inez</hi> make an end of their Dinner, and come and
divert us with their Castanietta's. While <hi>Augustinet</hi> went to
call up the Maids, <hi>Don Marcos</hi> stroking his whiskers with
admirable gravity, thus carry'd on the Discourse. If <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustinet,</hi>
says he, has a mind to keep in my favour, he must
renounce gaming and staying out late a nights. If
he'll keep good hours, I am content with all my heart
that he should lie in my house, but I'll have my windows
ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>red, and my doors locked and bolted before I go to bed:
not that I am in the least jealous in my temper, for I think
nothing can be more impertinent, equally when a man has
a virtuous wife, as I am going to have; but houses,
where there is any thing to lose, cannot be too well secured
against Thieves, and for my part I should run distracted,
if a Villain of a Thief, without any other trouble than that
of carrying off what he found, should rob me in an instant
of what my great industry had been scraping together
so many years; and therefore, continues <hi>Don Marcos,</hi> I
forbid him gaming and rambling a nights, or the Devil
shall roast me alive, and I will renounce the name of <hi>Don
Marcos.</hi> The Choleric Gentleman utter'd these last words
with so much vehemence and passion, that it cost <hi>Isidora</hi>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:53808:183"/>
abundance of fair Speeches to put him in a good humour
again. She conjured <hi>Don Marcos</hi> not to trouble him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
about the matter, assuring him that <hi>Augustinet</hi>
would not fail to answer his expectation in all points, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he was the most tractable and the best-conditioned
Boy that ever was known. The coming in of <hi>Augustinet</hi>
and the Dancers, put a stop to this discourse, so they spent
the greatest part of the night in Dancing and Singing, <hi>Don
Marcos</hi> being loath to give himself the trouble to walk to
his Lodgings so late, would by all means have perswaded
<hi>Isidora</hi> to give her consent, that they might live
from that time forward like Man and Wife together,
at least that she wou'd suffer him to lye at her
House that night. But our Widow putting on a severe
countenance, protested aloud, that ever since the unhappy
day, on which her Widdowhood commenced, no man li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
had set his Leg within her chaste Bed, which she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
for her Lord and Master, nor should do so, till the
rites of the Church were performed; adding, that in her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
circumstances her reputation wou'd not suffer her to
let any man, but only her Nephew <hi>Augustinet,</hi> lye in her
house. <hi>Don Marcos</hi> return'd her his humble thanks, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
his amorous impatience. He wish'd her a
good repose, return'd to his own lodging, accompany'd by
<hi>Gamara,</hi> took his end of a candle out of his pocket, fixed it
to the point of his Sword, lighted it at the Lamp of the
Crucifix: in short, he did every thing as he had done the
night before, so punctual was he in every respect, unless i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

were that he omitted to say his Prayers, because he though<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
his affair as good as concluded, and so did not want the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance
of Heaven to further it. The bans were soon pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished,
there coming a cluster of Holidays together: in fine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
this Marriage, so much desired on both sides, was celebrated
with more expence and formality, than one would have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
from so fordid a Miser, who for fear of touching his
six thousand Crowns, had borrow'd money of his friends to
defray the charges of the day. The chief Servants belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his Master were invited to the Wedding, who al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

concurred in commending the happy choice he had made.

of love he had bespoke very fine Wedding Cloaths for <hi>Isidora</hi>
and himself. All the Guests departed in good time, and
<hi>Don Marcos</hi> with his own hands locked the doors, barred
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:53808:183"/>
the gates, not so much to secure his Wife, as to secure the
Coffer wherein his Money lay, which he order'd to be set
near the Nuptial Bed. In short, the married couple went
to bed; and while <hi>Don Marcos,</hi> not finding all that he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
to find, began even then perhaps to repent of his
marriage, <hi>Marcella</hi> and <hi>Inez</hi> were grumbling together
at their Masters humour, and blam'd their Mistress for being
so hasty to be marry'd. <hi>Inez</hi> swore by her maker that she
wou'd sooner choose to be a Lay Sister in a Convent, than
endure to live in a house that was shut up at nine. And
what would you say were you in my case, says <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cella</hi>
to <hi>Inez;</hi> for you have the pleasure of going sometimes
to Market to buy things for the family; whereas I, who am
my Lady's Waiting-woman forsooth, must never peep
abroad, but live a solitary life with the chaste Wife of a jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Husband; and as for the Serenades we used to hear so
often, under our Windows, I expect to hear them no more
than the Music of the Spheres. Yet for all this, replies <hi>Inez,</hi>
we have not so much reason to complain as poor <hi>Augustinet.</hi>
He has spent the best part of his youth in waiting upon his
Aunt, who has disposed of her self as you see; she has set a
formal pedagogue over his head, who will reproach him a
hundred times a day with every bit he eats, and with his fine
Cloaths, which God knows whether he came honestly by.
You tell me news, says <hi>Marcella,</hi> that I never heard before,
and I don't wonder that our Mistress has made so foolish a
bargain, when her Nephew <hi>ad honores,</hi> is forced to pass his
time with us. If I wou'd have believed his fair promises,
I might easily have carry'd off the young Spark from his
Aunt, but she has kept me from my Childhood, and I
ought in conscience to be faithful to those, whose Bread I
eat. To tell you the truth, continued <hi>Inez,</hi> I have no aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to the poor Boy, and I must own to you, that I have
often pitied him, to see him sad and melancholy by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
while other people are making merry, and diverting
themselves. In this manner did these Servants entertain
one another, and reason upon their Mistress's Marriage.
The good <hi>Inez</hi> soon fell asleep, but the vertuous <hi>Marcella</hi>
had other things to mind. No sooner did she find her Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fellow
fast, but she steals out of bed, dresses herself, and
packs up in one bundle the Wedding-Cloaths of <hi>Isidora,</hi>
with some of <hi>Don Marcos</hi>'s things, which she had dexterously
convey'd out of their Chamber, before the provident Master
had lock'd the doors. When this was over, away she marches,
and because she had no design to return, she left open the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:53808:184"/>
doors of the Apartment, which <hi>Isidora</hi> hir'd in that house.
<hi>Inez</hi> awak'd not long after, and missing her companion, had
the curiosity to enquire what was become of her. She listen'd
at <hi>Augustinet</hi>'s door, not without some little suspicion, and
spice of jealousie; but hearing not the least noise there, she
examin'd every place where she thought it probable to find
her, but miss'd of her aim, and sees the doors left wide
open. She immediately ran upstairs, and rapt at the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
door of the new marry'd couple as hard as she cou'd
drive, whom she strangely alarm'd by this noise. She told
them that <hi>Marcella</hi> was gone, that she had left the doors
open, and that she was afraid she had carry'd off some
things, which she never design'd to restore. <hi>Don Marcos</hi>
leapt out of his bed like a mad man, ran to his Cloaths, but
found them gone as well as <hi>Isidora</hi>'s, and to his inexpressible
mortification, saw his dear Spouse of so different a figure
from what had charm'd him, that he thought he should
have sunk through the floor. The unfortunate Lady be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
awakened so on the sudden, took no notice that
her Tower was not upon her head. She saw it lying
on the ground near the bed, and was going to take it
up; but alas! we do nothing orderly when we go rashly
to work, and in confusion. She put the back part of it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
and her Visage, which had not received its usual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshing
so early in the morning, the gloss of her paint and
washes being gone, appeared so ghastly to <hi>Don Marcos,</hi>
that he fancied he saw a Spectre. If he cast his eyes upon
her, he beheld a terrible monster, and if he carried his
sight elsewhere, he found his Cloaths were missing. <hi>Isidora,</hi>
who was in a strange disorder, perceived some of her Teeth
hanging in the large, long, and well-peopled Mustachio's
of her Husband, and went about in this consternation to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
them; but the poor Man, whom she had so dismally
affrighted, not being able to imagine that she stretched out
her hands so near his face, with any other design, than to
strangle him, or pluck out his eyes, retired some paces
backward, and avoided her approaches with so much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress,
that not being able to come up to him, she was
forced at last to tell him, that some of her Teeth were lodged
in his Whiskers. <hi>Don Marcos</hi> directed his hands thither, and
finding his Wives Teeth, which formerly belonged to some
Elephant, a native of <hi>Afric,</hi> or the <hi>East Indies,</hi> dangling in his
Beard, he flung them at her with a great deal of indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
She gathered them up, as likewise those that were
scattered in the Bed, and up and down the Chamber, and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:53808:184"/>
retired to a little Closet with this precious treasure, her
Painting-brush and some other necessaries she had placed
upon her Toilette. In the mean time <hi>Don Marcos,</hi> after he
had heartily renounced his Maker, sat him down in a Chair,
where he made sorrowful reflections upon his being mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
to an old Beldame, whom he found by the venerable
Snow, which sixty long winters had shed upon her bald
skull, to be at least twenty years older than himself, and
yet was not so old neither, but that he might expect to be
plagued with her twenty years more. <hi>Augustinet,</hi> who upon
this noise had got up in hast, came half drest into the room,
and endeavoured all that lay his power to appease the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
husband of his Aunt by Adoption: But the poor man
did nothing but sigh, and beat his thighs with his hand,
and sometimes his face. He then bethought himself of a
fine Gold chain, which he had borrowed to set himself off on
the day of marriage, but to compleat his vexation, there
was nothing but the remembrance of it left him, for <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cella</hi>
had taken care to secure it among the other things she
carried off. He looked for it at first with some tranquillity,
but as carefully as might be, but after he had wearied him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to no purpose in looking for it all over the Chamber, he
found that it was lost, and his labour likewise, and then
certainly no despair cou'd equal his. He gave such terrible
groans, that they disturb'd all the neighbourhood where he
liv'd. Upon these doleful cries, <hi>Isidora</hi> bolted out of her
Closet, and appear'd so much renew'd, and so beautiful,
that the poor man thought this was the third time they had
chang'd his Wife. He look'd upon her with admiration,
and did not express himself angrily to her. At last he took
out of one of his Trunks the Cloaths he wore every day,
drest himself, and attended by <hi>Augustinet</hi> enquir'd in every
street after the perfidious <hi>Marcella.</hi> They look'd for her in
vain till the hour of dinner, which was made up of what
they had left the day before. <hi>Don Marcos</hi> and <hi>Isidora</hi>
quarrell'd with one another, like people that had a desire
to dine, and dined like people that had as good a stomach
to quarrel. However, <hi>Isidora</hi> sometimes endeavour'd to
bring back <hi>Don Marcos</hi> to his peaceable humour, speaking
to him in as submissive and humble terms as she cou'd think
of; and <hi>Augustinet</hi> us'd his best entreaties to reconcile them
to each other; but the loss of the Gold Chain was more to
<hi>Don Marcos</hi> than a stab with a Dagger through his body.
They were ready to rise from Table, where they had done
little else but quarrel, while <hi>Augustinet</hi> all alone by himself
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:53808:185"/>
employ'd his teeth to the best purpose, when there came
into the room two men from the Steward of the Admiral of
<hi>Castile,</hi> who desired the Lady <hi>Isidora</hi> to send him the Silver
Plate he had lent her only for fifteen days, and she had kept
above twenty. <hi>Isidora</hi> cou'd not tell what other answer to
make him, but that she wou'd go and fetch it. <hi>Don Marcos</hi>
pretended that the Plate belong'd to him, and he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd
to keep it. One of the men stay'd still in the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
lest they should remove that which they made such a
difficulty to restore, while the other went to find out the
Master of the House, who came, and reproach'd <hi>Isidora</hi> with
her unjust dealing, took no notice of the opposition <hi>Don
Marcos</hi> made, and in spite of all that he said to him, mov'd
off with the Plate, and left the husband and wife quarrelling
with one another about this new disaster. Their dispute,
or to speak more properly, their quarrel was in a manner
concluded, when a Pawn-broker, accompanied with his
Porters and followers, came into the room, and told <hi>Isidora</hi>
that since he was inform'd she was marry'd to a man of bulk
and substance, he was come to fetch the moveables she had
hired of him, and the Money due for the loan of them, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
she was minded to buy them. Here <hi>Don Marcos</hi> lost all
his patience, he call'd the Broker Sawcy Rogue and Rascal,
and threaten'd to be labour him lustily. The Broker told
him he valu'd not his big words, that every honest man
ought to restore what did not belong to him, and fell foul
upon <hi>Isidora</hi> with unmannerly language, who was nor want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on her side to give him as good as he brought. He struck
her, she return'd the blow, and the floor was in a minute
cover'd with the counterfeit Teeth and Hair of <hi>Isidora;</hi>
with the Cloak, Hat and Gloves of <hi>Don Marcos,</hi> who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpos'd
to defend the vertuous Rib of his side. While the
Combatants were gathering up their things that were fallen
on the ground, while the Broker remov'd the moveables, and
paid himself as honest Brokers use to do, and all of them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
made a noise as if Hell were broke loose, the Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord
of the House, who lodg'd in an Apartment above,
came down into <hi>Isidora</hi>'s room, and acquainted her, that if
they design'd to make such a noise as that every day, they
must e'en go seek out another Lodging. 'Tis you, you
impertinent Puppy, that must seek on another Lodging,
replies <hi>Don Marcos,</hi> whose anger had made him as pale as a
Ghost. Upon this the Landlord answered him with a box
on the ear, and our angry Don was looking for his Sword or
Ponyard, out <hi>Marcella</hi> had carry'd them off; <hi>Isidora</hi> and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:53808:185"/>
                  <hi>Augustinet</hi> interposed in the scuffle, and with much ado ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peased
the Master of the House, but not <hi>Don Marcos,</hi> who
beat his Head against the Walls, calling <hi>Isidora</hi> a hundred
times Cheat, and Strumpet, and Thief. <hi>Isidora</hi> with tears
in her eyes answer'd him, that a poor woman ought not
to be blam'd for setting her brains to work to get a man of
such merit as <hi>Don Marcos</hi> was, and therefore he had more
reason to admire her for her wit, than to beat her as he
did; adding, that even in point<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of honour, a man ought
never to lay hands on his Wife. <hi>Don Marcos</hi> swearing most
heroically, protested that his Money was his honour, and
that he was resolved to be unmarry'd, whatever it cost him.
To this the meek <hi>Isidora</hi> replied with a world of humility,
that she would still be his loving Wife, that their Marriage
had been celebrated in the usual forms, and 'twas impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to dissolve it, for which reason she advised him to sit
still and be patient. When this point was pretty well o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
the next question was, where they should take ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Lodging, since this was too hot for 'em. <hi>Don Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cos</hi>
and <hi>Augustinet</hi> walked out to find one, and in this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval
<hi>Isidora</hi> enjoy'd a little breathing time, and with the
trusty <hi>Inez,</hi> comforted herself for the ill humour of her
Husband, so long as she saw his Trunks full of Money still
in the Chamber. <hi>Don Marcos</hi> took a convenient Lodging
in his Master's Neighbourhood, and sent <hi>Augustinet</hi> home
to sup with his Aunt, not being able, as he said, to bring
himself as yet to eat with such an impudent Cheat. To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the evening he came home as surly as a baited Bear,
and as fierce as a Tyger. <hi>Isidora</hi> endeavour'd by all her arts
to soften him into a better temper, and next morning had
the boldness to desire him to go to his new Lodging and
stay there to receive the moveables, that <hi>Augustinet</hi> and
<hi>Inez</hi> were going to carry to a Cart, which they had newly
hired. <hi>Don Marcos</hi> accordingly went thither, and while he
expected their coming, the ungrateful <hi>Isidora,</hi> the knavish
<hi>Augustinet,</hi> and the jilting <hi>Inez,</hi> with all expedition con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd
the whole substance of this unfortunate man into a
Cart, drawn by lusty able mules, went into it themselves,
quitted <hi>Madrid,</hi> and took the Road to <hi>Barcelona. Don
Marcos</hi> who had exhausted all his patience, in waiting for
their coming, went back to his former Lodging, found the
doors shut up, and was inform<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d by the Neighbours, that they
had remov'd from thence with their Goods several hours
ago. Upon this he return'd to the place from whence he
came, but did not find what he expected. Immediately he
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:53808:186"/>
went back to the old place, suspecting the misfortune that
had happen'd to him, he breaks open the Chamber door,
where he could see nothing but a few wretched wooden
Platters, an old rusty pair of Tongues, a batter'd pair of
Bellows, the broken leg of a crippled Andiron, and such like
precious Ware, which they had left behind them, as not
thinking it worth their while to encumber the Cart with
them. And now he was convinc'd into what treacherous
hands he had fallen; he tears off his Beard and his Hair,
he buffe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

nay, he was sorely tempted to kill himself, but his hour was
not yet come. The most unfortunate men sometimes flatter
themselves with vain hopes. Thus he went to find out the
Fugitives in all the Inns of <hi>madrid,</hi> but could hear no tale
or tidings of them. <hi>Isidora</hi> was not such a fool as to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
a Cart by which she might be betray'd, but had hired
one in an Inn near <hi>Madrid,</hi> and to secure herself from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
pursu'd, had articled before-hand with the Owner, that
he should stay no longer in the City than was sufficient to
take her up, her Company, and her Goods. More tir'd and
weary than a Dog that has cours'd a Hare and mist her, our
poor Gentleman was returning home, after he had enquir'd
at all the Inns in the City and Suburbs, when by meer acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
he popt upon <hi>Marcella</hi> head to head. He caught hold
of her by the throat, and cry'd out to her, <hi>And have I met
thee, thou traiterous baggage, I will keep thee fast, till thou hast
restored every farthing thou hast stole from me.</hi> Oh! good
Heavens, says this subtle Dissembler, without changing
countenance for the matter, how did I always mistrust that
this would fall upon me. Hear me, dear Master, for the
love of the Blessed Virgin, hear me, before you ruin my
reputation. I am a woman of vertue and honesty, I thank
my good God for it; and shou'd you disgrace me never so
little before my neighbours here, twou'd be my utter un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing,
for I am upon the point of Marriage. Let us step
to yonder corner, and if your Lordship will give me the
hearing, I will tell you what is become of your Chain and
Cloaths. I knew well enough that the blame wou'd be laid
upon me for what has happen'd, and told my Mistress so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand,
when she forc'd me to do what I did, but she was
Mistress, and I a poor Servant. Well! how wretched is the
condition of those that serve, and what pains do they take to
get a sorry livelihood. <hi>Don Marcos</hi> had little malice in his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
the tears and eloquence of this dissembling Cockatrice
inclin'd him to listen to her, and even to believe whatever
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:53808:186"/>
she told him. He walked with her therefore under a Porch
belonging to a great House, where she inform'd him, that
<hi>Isidora</hi> was an old batter'd Strumpet, who in her time had
ruin'd several persons that were smitten with her, but had
saved nothing out of all her gettings, by reason of her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
and riotous living. She likewise told him, what she
had learn'd from <hi>Inez,</hi> that <hi>Augustinet</hi> was not Nephew to
<hi>Isidora,</hi> but a sort of a Bravo, the Bastard of another Whore,
and that she caus'd him to pass for her Nephew, only to
give her some authority among women of her own professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and to revenge her quarrels. She acquainted him that
it was he to whom she had given the Gold Chain and the
Cloaths that were stoln, and that it was by his order that
she went away in the night, without taking leave, that so
only she might be suspected of so wicked an action. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cella</hi>
told all these fine Stories to <hi>Don Marcos,</hi> not at all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding
what might be the consequence, either to get clear
out of his hands, or perhaps to keep up a good old custom
long ago observ'd among Servants, which is to lye boldly, and
tell their Masters all that they don't know, as well as all they
know. She cocluded her discourse with an exhortation
to him to be patient, giving him hopes that his things might
be restor'd to him, when he least expected it. <hi>And perhaps
never,</hi> replies <hi>Don Marcos</hi> very discreetly; <hi>there is little like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood
that a Traytress, who has robb'd me of my goods, and is
gone off with them, will ever return to restore them to me.</hi> He
afterwards told <hi>Marcella</hi> all that had befallen him with
<hi>Isidora,</hi> ever since she was gone. Is it possible she shou'd
have so little conscience with her? says that wheed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
Devil <hi>Marcella.</hi> Ah! dear Master 'twas not without
good reason that I pitty'd your hard usage, but I durst not
say any thing to you of it: for that very evening you were
robb'd, taking the boldness to tell my Mistress, that
she ought not to touch your Gold-chain, she beat me
black and blue God-knows, and called me all the Whores in
the Creation. <hi>But thus the case happen'd,</hi> says <hi>Don Marcos,</hi>
fetching a deep sigh, <hi>and the worst of it is, that I see no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
to help me.</hi> Hold a little, crys <hi>Marcella</hi> interrupting
him, I know a cunning man, a friend of mine, who will
shortly be my husband, I trust in Heaven, and he will tell
you where you may find these people, as plainly as if he saw
them. He's an admirable man, that's certain, and can
make the Devil fetch and carry for him like a Grey-hound.
The credulous <hi>Don Marcos</hi> conjur'd her to let him see this
Son of Art. <hi>Marcella</hi> promis'd him to do it, and told him
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:53808:187"/>
she wou'd certainly meet him the next day in that very
place. <hi>Don Marcos</hi> accordingly came thither, nor was <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cella</hi>
forgetful of the appointment, telling our unfortunate
Spark, that the Magician she had talk'd to him about, had
already begun his operations to help him to his stoln goods,
but that he wanted a certain quantity of Amber, Musk, and
other Perfumes, wherewith he was to make a fumigation
for the Daemons whom he intended to invoke, who were all
of the first order, and of the best families in Hell. <hi>Don
Marcos,</hi> without deliberating farther on the matter, carries
<hi>Marcella</hi> to a Perfumers shop, buys as much of those scents
as she told him wou'd be necessary, nay, and presented her
with some Essences and Oyls she begg'd of him, so much
did he fancy himself oblig'd to her for helping him to a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gician.
The wicked <hi>Marcella</hi> carry'd him to a house of a
very scurvy aspect, where in a low room, or rather a nasty
Dog-hole, he was receiv'd by a man in a Cassock, whose
beard reach'd down to his girdle, and who receiv'd him
with a world of gravity. This villanous Impostor, on
whom <hi>Don Marcos</hi> look'd with a great deal of respect and
fear, two qualities that generally go together, lighted two
black Wax Candles, and gave them to the affrighted <hi>Don
Marcos</hi> to hold one in each hand. He order'd him to sit
down upon a little low Stool, and exhorted him, but his
exhortations came too late, not to be afraid. After this, he
ask'd him several questions about his age, his way of living,
and about the goods that were stoln from him; and having
look'd a while in a Mirror, and read half a score lines in a
Book, he told <hi>Don Marcos,</hi> who was ready to expire with
fear, that he very well knew where his things were, and
described them one after another so exactly to him, that
<hi>Don Marcos</hi> let the Candles drop out of his hands, to hug and
embrace him. The serious Magician blam'd him extremely
for his impatience, and told him that the operations of his
infallible Art demanded a great deal of circumspection and
care; giving him to understand, that for actions less
hardy and indiscreet, the Daemons had sorely buffeted, nay,
and strangled some persons. At these words <hi>Don Marcos</hi>
look'd as pale as a Criminal after Sentence, and taking the
Candles again in his hands, sat down on his stool. The
Conjurer then call'd for his Perfumes that <hi>Don Marcos</hi> had
bought, and the perfidious <hi>Marcella</hi> gave them to him. Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
she had been a spectatress of the Ceremony, but now
he commanded her to quit the room, because, says he, the
Devils don't like the company of Women. <hi>Marcella</hi> at her
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:53808:187"/>
going out made a profound reverence, and the Magician
drawing near a little pan of Coals, made as if he threw <hi>Don
Marcos</hi>'s perfumes upon the lighted Charcoal, but indeed
threw a noisome composition into it, which cast so thick
and dismal a smoke, that the Magician, who imprudently
lean'd over the pan, had like to been suffocated. He
cough'd several times to expectorate the steams he had
suck'd in, and that with so much violence, that his long ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable
Beard, which was not of the growth of his chin, and
had been ill-fastened on, fell down, and discovered
him to <hi>Don Marcos</hi> to be the pernicious <hi>Gamara.
Don Marcos</hi> caught hold of him by the throat, griped and
squeez'd him like any <hi>Hercules,</hi> crying out Theif in a shrill,
terrible voice. As it happened, the Magistrate was going
down the Street at that time, who enter'd the House, from
whence such dismal cryes proceeded, that they alarm'd all
the Neighbourhood; for you must know, that <hi>Gamara,</hi>
whom <hi>Don Marcos</hi> all this while held by the throat, roar'd
out as loud as he could do for the heart of him. The first
person the Officers seiz'd, was <hi>Marcella,</hi> and breaking open
the door of this Magical Apartment, they found <hi>Don Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cos</hi>
and <hi>Gamara</hi> very lovingly griping and tugging one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
about the room. The Provost knew <hi>Gamara</hi> at first
sight, whom he had been hunting after a good while, and
had ordered to be apprehended for a Pick-pocket, a Cock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bawd,
and above all a notorious Thief. He hurried him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
to Prison with <hi>Don Marcos</hi> and <hi>Marcella,</hi> took an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventory
of all the Goods in the House, and saw them care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
locked up. <hi>Don Marcos</hi> was enlarg'd upon his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster's
security, that he should appear next day. According<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he came as Evidence against <hi>Gamara</hi> and <hi>Marcella,</hi> who
were plainly convicted to have robbed him of his Goods,
that were found safe and untoucht, among several other
things that had been set down in the Inventory, some of
which he had stole, and the rest were pawn'd to him, for
he was a <hi>Iew</hi> by Religion, and consequently an Usurer by
Profession. When he was apprehended, he was just upon
the point of Marrying <hi>Marcella,</hi> who was to bring him by
way of Portion, besides the things she had stoln from
<hi>Don Marcos,</hi> a dexterity in stealing, not inferiour to his
own, a pliant wit, capable of learning any thing that could
be shewn her; nay, even of surpassing it: and lastly, a
wholesome, juicy, young Body, considering it had been so
often bought and sold, and had endured so many heavy
shocks and fatigues in the Mansions of Fornication. The
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:53808:188"/>
case appeared so plain on <hi>Don Marcos</hi>'s side, who was sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
by the Credit of his Master, that he had his own
Goods immediately restored to him. <hi>Gamara</hi> was sent to
the Galleys for the remainder of his life; <hi>Marcella</hi> was
soundly whipt and banish'd, and all people thought that the
<hi>Iew</hi> and his Wife elect, were too favourably dealt with. As
for <hi>Don Marcos,</hi> he was not so well pleased to have his
things again, and be revenged on <hi>Gamara</hi> and <hi>Marcella,</hi> as
vext that this great Impostor did not prove a Magician.
The loss of his ten thousand Crowns had almost turn'd his
Brain. He went every day to enquire at all the Inns of
<hi>Madrid,</hi> and at last met with two Muleteers lately return'd
from <hi>Barcelona,</hi> who told him, that about four or five days
journey from <hi>Madrid</hi> they had met a Cart upon the Road
laden with Goods, and two women and a man riding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind,
and that they had been forced to make an halt at an
Inn, because two of the Fellow's Mules were killed with being
over-laboured. They described this man and the two wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
to him, and the marks they gave them so fitted <hi>Isido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,
Inez,</hi> and <hi>Augustinet,</hi> that without farther deliberation
he disguised himself in the habit of a Pilgrim, and having
obtained of his Master Letters of recommendation to the
Viceroy of <hi>Catalonia,</hi> and from the Justice a Decree for his
Fugitive Wife, he took the Road to <hi>Barcelona,</hi> sometimes
beating it upon the hoof, sometimes on Horseback, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
there in few days. He went towards the Harbour to
take a Lodging there, and the first thing that greeted his
sight was his own Coffers, that were carrying to a Boat,
with <hi>Augustinet, Isidora</hi> and <hi>Inez</hi> attending them, which was
to convey them to the Vessel that expected them in the
Road, wherein they designed to imbark for <hi>Naples. Don
Marcos</hi> followed his Enemies, and threw himself like a
Lyon into the Long-boat. They did not know him by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of his huge slapping Pilgrims Hat, that eclipsed his little
Countenance, but took him to be some Pilgrim going to
<hi>Loretto,</hi> as the Seamen took him to be one of <hi>Augustinet</hi>'s
Company. <hi>Don Marcos</hi> was in the strangest perplexities of
mind that can be imagin'd, not so much for what would
become of himself, as what wou'd become of his dear
Trunks. All, this while the Long-boat made the best of
her way to the Merchantman, and sailed so swift, or rather
<hi>Don Marcos</hi> was so puzzled with what his brains were ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mering,
that he found himself directly under the Vessel,
when he thought himself at a great distance from it. The
Sailors now begun to heave up the Trunks, which awaken'd
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:53808:188"/>
                  <hi>Don Marcos</hi> out of his contemplations, who always kep
his eye upon the dearest of his Trunks, wherein his money
was lodged. A Seaman at last came to take up this very
individual Trunk to fasten it to the rest with a thick Cord
that was let down from the Vessel in a Pully. And now it
was that <hi>Don Marcos</hi> forgot himself, he saw his Trunk ty'd up
just by him and did not stir; but at last seeing it mount up in
the air, he caught hold of it with both hands, by one of the
iron rings that served to lift it up from the ground, being
resolved not to part with it. And perhaps he had accomplish'd
his ends, for what will not a covetous Wretch do to preserve
his Pelf? But by ill fortune this Trunk parted from the rest,
and falling plumb upon the head of our unlucky Gentleman,
who for all that wou'd not quit his hold, beat him down to
the bottom of the Sea, or if you please to the regions of <hi>Ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus.
Isidora, Inez,</hi> and <hi>Augustinet</hi> knew him just at the very
minute he sunk down with their dear Trunk, the loss of
which troubled them infinitely more, than any apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
from the revengeful <hi>Don Marcos. Augustinet</hi> enraged at
the loss of his Money, and not able to master his passion, struck
the Seaman, who had tyed the Trunks so carelessly with all
his force. The Tar in requital gave him a heartier blow,
which threw him into the Sea. As he fell over-board, he
took the unfortunate <hi>Isidora</hi> with him, who held her self by
nothing, and thus accompanied her beloved <hi>Augustinet,</hi> who
against his inclination accompany'd <hi>Don Marcos. Inez</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bark'd
in the Vessel with the rest of the Goods, which she
spent in a short time at <hi>Naples,</hi> and after she had for a long
while exercis'd the laudable profession of a Whore, she went
off like a Whore, that is to say, she dy'd in an Hospital.</p>

the above-mention'd <hi>Don Pedro</hi> at the age of twenty found
himself without Father and Mother, and exceeding rich;
which circumstances, when they meet in the same person,
very often help to spoil him, if he is born with no great
stock of brains; but if 'tis otherwise, put him in a capacity
of making what figure he pleases. During the year of
mourning he discreetly abstained from most of those diversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,

person, had abundance of Wit, and behaving himself, young
as he was, with the prudence and circumspection of an old
man, there was not a fortune in all <hi>Granada</hi> which he
might not justly pretend to, nor a Father that thought so

her fortune was not altogether so great as that of <hi>Don Pedro,</hi>
yet every thing considered, there was no such mighty diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence

him a Rival, who had already taken possession of the Town
he design'd to invest, before he had so much as made his
approaches. 'Tis to no purpose to tell you his name, but
he was very near <hi>Don Pedro</hi>'s age, perhaps he was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
as handsome as he, but all Historians are ageeed that
he was much more belov'd. <hi>Don Pedro</hi> was soon sensible
that he had a Competitor to remove, but this did not much
alarm him, knowing few were able to dispute Estates with
him. He gave Consorts of Music in his Mistress's street,
while his happy Rival had the pleasure to hear them in her
Chamber, and perhaps was revelling in her arms, while our
poor Lover was cooling his heels, and making melancholy
reflections below. But at last <hi>Don Pedro</hi> was weary of
throwing away so much Powder in the Mines, that is to
say, of making all this bustle and courtship, without ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing
his affairs. However, his love did not slacken up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his ill success, but made him so impatient, that he thought
fit to lay aside his first design of winning his Mistress's heart
before he demanded her of her friends. In short, he ask'd
their consent, which they granted him upon the spot, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
deliberating further on the matter, being extremely
pleas'd to be ask'd that which they so earnestly desired, and
indeed cou'd hardly hope for. They acquainted <hi>Seraphina</hi>
with the good fortune that was offer'd her, and prepar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to give <hi>Don Pedro</hi> a kind reception, and marry him in a
short time. She was troubled at this news, that ought to
have given her all the satisfaction in the world; and not
able to conceal her surprize from them, she dissembled the
occasion of it, pretending that it griev'd her to part from
persons so dear to her as they were. She manag'd this point
so dexterously, that they wept out of meer tenderness, and
much commended the sweetness of her temper. She con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd
them to put off her Marriage four or five months, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenting
to them, that she had been a long time indisposed,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:53808:190"/>

will she wou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of her illness, that so she might come more agreeable to her
Husband, and not give him any occasion to be disgusted
with her in the beginning of his marriage; and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to repent of his choice. 'Tis true indeed, she had look'd
somewhat sickly of late, which made her Friends well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
satisfy'd with her request, and they took care to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
<hi>Don Pedro</hi> with it; who for his part was so far from
taking it ill, that he lik'd her the better for giving so good a
proof of her discretion. In the mean time the Articles of
Marriage were propos'd, examin'd, and agreed on. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
<hi>Don Pedro</hi> did not think himself excus'd from omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
any of his usual Gallantries, which every man is obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to observe, that courts his Mistress in the common
forms. He entertain'd her often with Letters, and did not
miss a day to write to her. She return'd him such answers
that were at least very civil, if they were not altogether so
passionate as his own: but she wou'd receive none of his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sits
in the day time, excusing herself upon her indisposition,
and at night appear'd very rarely at the Window, which
made <hi>Don Pedro</hi> exceedingly admire her reserv'd temper.
He thought too well of his own merit to doubt the success
of his Courtship, and question'd not to be belov'd by his
Mistress, when she came to know him better, altho she had
even an aversion for him, now he was a stranger to her.
Hitherto his affairs went well enough, but at last it so hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd
that he could not get a sight of his Mistress for four or
five days following. He was extremely afflicted at it, or at
least pretended to be so. He compos'd several Verses upon
the occasion, I mean, he either hir'd or bought them, and
had them sung under her Window. But tho he omitted no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that the most zealous Lovers cou'd practise, yet all the
favour he cou'd obtain was only to speak with her Maid,
who inform'd him that her Lady was more indispos'd than
ever. Upon this his Poetic Faculty was strangely perplex'd,
or at least the Gentleman-Poet whom he employ'd: for up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the strictest search I find that versifying was never his ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent.
He caus'd an Ayre to be made upon <hi>Aminta</hi>'s being
sick, or <hi>Phyllis</hi> or <hi>Chloris,</hi> no matter whether: and besides
his offensive and defensive Arms, taking a Guitarr with
him, which we must suppose to be the best in the whole
City, he walk'd furiously in this Equipage towards his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress's
quarter, either to make her weep out of pure com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion,
or else to set all the Dogs in the neighbourhood a
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:53808:190"/>
barking, in order to compleat the Consort. Any one, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
wou'd say a hundred to one that our Gentleman must
do one of the two, or perhaps both; but alas he neither did
one nor the other: Within fifty paces of the thrice happy
Mansion of his Divinity, he saw the door open, and a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
go out, who had much of the air and shape of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible
Angel. He cou'd not imagin why a woman alone,
and so late at night, should so resolutely turn up into a
large spacious House, lately destroyed by fire. To inform
himself better, he walked round the ruins, which one might
enter at several places, that he might get nearer the person
whom he dogged. He believed that this might be his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress,
who had made an assignation with his Rival to meet
her in this strange place, not daring to do it at home, and
not thinking fit to communicate this business to a third per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
which it so much concern'd her to keep secret; and he
resolved within himself, that in case what he now only
suspected, happen'd to prove true, to kill his Rival upon
the spot, and to revenge himself upon <hi>Seraphina,</hi> by giving
her the most opprobrious Language he could think of. So
he crept along as softly as he could, till he came to a place,
from whence he could plainly see her, for it was she, sitting
upon the ground, and groaning so piteously, as if she was
going to give up the Ghost; and, in short, after most severe
pangs deliver'd of a small squawling Creature, which we
may suppose did not give her altogether so much pain in
the begetting. She was no sooner safely deliver'd, but her
Courage giving her strength enough, she return'd the same
way she came, without troubling her head what would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
of the poor Brat, that she had brought into the
world: I will leave you to judge how great <hi>Don Pedro</hi>'s
surprize was. He now found out the true reason of his
Mistress's indisposition: His head almost turn'd round to
think what a Precipice he had escaped, and he thanked
Heaven most devoutly for preserving him from the danger;
but being generous in his temper, he scorn'd to revenge
himself upon the faithless <hi>Seraphina,</hi> by exposing the Honour
of her Family; neither in his just resentment wou'd he suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
the innocent Babe to perish, which he saw lying at his
Feet, exposed to the first dog that had the luck to find it.
He wrapt it up in his Cloak, for want of something else,
and making all the haste he cou'd, he call'd upon a discreet
woman of his acquaintance, to whom he recommended the
Child, putting it at the same time into her hands, and gave
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:53808:191"/>
her Money to buy it all necessaries. This discreet woman
finding herself nobly pay'd, acquitted herself very well in
her charge: Next day the Infant had a Nurse, was baptiz'd,
and nam'd <hi>Laura,</hi> for you must know she was a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male.</p>
               <p>In the mean time <hi>Don Pedro</hi> went to a Relation, in
whom he mightily confided, and told her he had alter'd
his design of marrying, into that of travelling. He desir'd
her to manage his Estate for him in his absence, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
into her house an Infant, which he said belong'd to
him, to spare nothing in her education; and for certain
reasons, which he wou'd acquaint her with at some other
time, to send her to a Convent as soon as she was three
years old; and above all, to take particular care that she
should know as little as might be of the affairs of this world.
He furnish'd her with necessary Instruments to look after
his Estate, provided himself with Money and Jewels, took
a faithful and trusty Servant, but before his departure <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>
                  <hi>Granada</hi> writ a Letter to <hi>Seraphina.</hi> She receiv'd it just at
the time as she had acquainted her friends that her illness
shou'd retard her Marriage no longer: But <hi>Don Pedro</hi>'s Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
which gave her to understand that he knew what had
so lately befallen her, put other thoughts into her head. She
devoted herself to a Religious life, and soon after retir'd to
a Convent, with a full resolution never to stir out of it, and
cou'd not be induc'd to alter her mind by all the entreaties
and tears of her Parents, who us'd all the arguments they
cou'd think of to disswade her from this resolution; which
appear'd so much the stranger to them, as they could not
divine the occasion of it. Let us leave them to weep for
their Daughter's turning Nun, who on her part wept hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
for her sins. Let us leave her little Daughter <hi>Laura</hi> to
grow in bulk and beauty, and return to find <hi>Don Pedro</hi> on
the Road to <hi>Sevil,</hi> who cou'd not drive this late adventure
out of his head, and was as much disgusted at Marriage, as
once he was desirous to taste the pleasures of it. He is
afraid of all Women, and not considering that there are
both good and bad of that as well as of our own Sex, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
within himself that a wise man ought to be diffident
of all women, and particularly of the witty more than the
foolish; being, it seems, of the opinion of those worthy
Gentlemen, who think that a woman knows more than
comes to her share, if she knows a jot more than stewing
Prunes, preserving Fruits, dressing her Husband's Dinner,
and mending his Stockings. Tainted with these heretical
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:53808:191"/>
doctrines, he arriv'd at <hi>Sevil,</hi> and went directly to the house
of <hi>Don Iuan</hi> the Lord knows what, a man of wealth and
quality, who was his relation and friend, and wou'd not
suffer him to lodge any where else but with him. The mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence
of <hi>Sevil</hi> gave him a desire to make a longer stay
there than he design'd at first; and his Cousin <hi>Don Iuan,</hi> to
make his stay agreeable to him, shew'd him all the most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
curiosities of the place. One day as they rode on
Horseback through one of the principal Streets of the City,
they saw in a Coach, that was driving towards a stately
House, a young Lady in a Widows habit, but so beautiful
and charming, that <hi>Don Pedro</hi> was exceedingly surprized,
and set his Cousin a laughing by the many vehement ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations
and oaths he made, that he had never seen any
thing so lovely in his life. This Angel of a Widow resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the whole Female Sex to his good opinion, whom the
unhappy <hi>Sepaphtna</hi> had render'd odious to him. He desir'd
<hi>Don Iuan</hi> to go back through the same Street, and frankly
own'd to him, that he wanted little of being wounded to
the heart. Your business is done, replies the other, and I
am very much mistaken if the little God has not shot his
Arrow so deep, that there is no plucking it out, but heart
and all must come together. Alas! says the amorous <hi>Don
Pedro,</hi> I will conceal nothing from you: How happy shou'd
I reckon my self, if I could pass my days with so charming
a Lady. You must go this way then, reply'd <hi>Don Iuan,</hi>
and travelling so fast as you do, you may in a few minutes
arrive at the place, where you expect to find so much hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness.
Not but that such an Enterprize, continu'd he, will
give you difficulty enough. <hi>Elvira</hi> is a woman of condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and very rich, her Beauty is such as you have beheld
it, neither is her Virtue inferiour to her Beauty, and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the two years of her Widowhood, the best matches in
<hi>Andalusia</hi> have not given her the least inclination to change
her state; but a man so well made as yourself, may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
succeed where others have failed. She is related to
my Wife, and sometimes I make her a visit. If you please
I will propose your design to her, and I have good hopes
to succeed in my Negotiation, because I see her in her Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cony,
which is no small favour, let me tell you, in so nice
and reserv'd a Lady. She might have shut her Lattices and
Windows, and so have balked our expectation. These
words were no sooner out of his mouth, but our two Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valiers
made each of them a reverence after the <hi>Spanish</hi>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:53808:192"/>
mode, which gave them no little trouble before they came
to an end of it. Especially <hi>Don Pedro</hi> made his so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundly,
and with that contortion of his Body, that he
had like to have tumbled from his Horse. The Lady in
the Balcony returned them a handsom Courtsie: Upon
which <hi>Don Pedro</hi> and his Companion bow'd again.
<q>
                     <l>And when the bright Charmer did leave the Balcony,</l>
                     <l>One spurr'd on his Horse, t'other gap'd like a Tony.</l>
                  </q>
Alas! My dear Cousin, says <hi>Don Pedro</hi> to <hi>Don Iuan,</hi> what
probability is there that a Stranger will be able to gain that
heart, which has defended itself against all the men of qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
and merit in <hi>Sevil.</hi> However, continues he, since my
despair wou'd otherwise give me my deaths wound, I had
as good receive it from her refusal and contempt. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let me conjure you to speak to her as soon as you can,
and don't so much enlarge upon my Estate and Quality, as
upon the violence of my passion. <hi>Don Pedro</hi> could not
talk of any thing but his love, and <hi>Don Iuan</hi> was sensible
that he cou'd not oblige him more effectually, than by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the first opportunity to make this overture to <hi>Elvira.</hi>
He accordingly did so, and not without success. The
Charming Widow receiv'd the proposal he made for his
Friend so well, that she confess'd to him that she did not
dislike him. But she withal acquainted him, that having
oblig'd herself by a vow to stay three full years, from the
death of her first Husband till she took a second, nothing
in the world should prevail with her to break it. She
added, that because she had resolved to pay this respect to
the memory of her late Spouse, she had hitherto refus'd
all the offers that had been made her; but that if <hi>Don
Pedro</hi> had courage and constancy enough to serve her a
whole year, in which time they might know one anothers
temper much better, she gave him her word to chuse no
other Husband but him. <hi>Don Iuan</hi> came to give <hi>Don Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dro</hi>
an account of his Nego<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>iation, and made him the most
satisfy'd, and most passionate of all men living. He was
not in the least deterr'd by the long time he was to stay,
and resolv'd to employ it in all the refin'd Gallantry of a
nice Lover. He bought him a Coach and Horses, made
his House and his Liveries as sumptuous as might be, set
all the Embroiderers and Taylors of <hi>Sevil</hi> at work, and
the Musicians into the bargain. He offer'd to regale <hi>Elvira,</hi>
but she wou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d not suffer it. Her Servants were nothing near
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:53808:192"/>
so difficult, and accepted his Presents as heartily as he gave
them. In a short time he was more Master of <hi>Elvira</hi>'s
Domestics than <hi>Elvira</hi> herself, whom her Damosels persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to appear in the Balcony, even when she had no mind
to it, as often as <hi>Don Pedro</hi> exerted his Lungs in the
Street, for I have been told he sung to admiration. <hi>Don
Pedro</hi> had now spent six tedious months in courting <hi>Elvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi>
without being able to obtain a private conversation with
her all this while, which daily increased his esteem and love
for her. At last, by dint of prayers and presents, a Damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel
bolder than the rest, or rather more covetous, promis'd
to introduce him one night into her Mistress's Apartment,
and place him in a corner, where he might see her undress
herself before she went to bed, take two or three turns in
her Chamber in her Shift to cool herself, and sing and play
upon her Lute, which she did to a miracle. <hi>Don Pedro</hi> gave
this trusty Maid a better reward than he promis'd her, and
when night came, our <hi>Granada</hi>-Adventurer, following the
Maid's instruction, slipt into <hi>Elvira</hi>'s house, stole up to her
Apartment, and there from a Gallery, which was over
against the Chamber-door, he saw her lying upon a Couch
reading a Book of Devotion, whether with much attention
is more than I am able to tell you, all the while her Maids
undrest her. She had only a light Gown on, and was ready
to go to bed, when <hi>Don Pedro</hi>'s Pensionary Damosel, who
design'd to give him as much reason to be satisfy'd with her,
as she was with him, entreated her Mistress to sing. Her
companions joyn'd in the same petition, but <hi>Elvira</hi> deny<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d
them a good while, telling them she was very melancholy,
nay, and assuring them that she had occasion to be so. But
the Damosel, whom <hi>Don Pedro</hi>'s presents had gain'd, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
a Lute into her Mistress<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s hand, <hi>Elvira</hi> was so complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
as to sing, which she did in so charming and graceful a
manner, that <hi>Don Pedro</hi> was within an ace of throwing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
at her heavenly feet, and there acting the ravish<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.
The Song was soon over, and then she went to bed.
The Maids retir'd to their own Apartments, and <hi>Don Pedro,</hi>
who made the best of his way to the street, was strangely
surpriz'd to find the great Gate lock'd. He had nothing
left him to do but to stay there till day, which wou'd soon
appear. He sat upon the side of a Well, which was in a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of the Court, being strangely perplex'd lest he shou'd be
discover'd, and incur his Mistress's displeasure for so bold an
attempt. He had not been here long, but he made a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
attempts, and wish'd as often to no purpose that he
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:53808:193"/>
was safe in the street, when he heard a door open in <hi>Elvira's</hi>
Apartment. He immediately turn'd his head towards the
place whence the noise came, and was strangely surpriz'd to
see the beautiful Widow come into the Court, whom he
thought to be fast asleep. By the light of a Wax-Taper,
which she carry'd in a little Silver Candlestick, he saw that
her Night-dress was nicely adjusted, her Breasts open
and unguarded, a fine Necklace of Pearl about her Neck,
and that over her Smock, which had more Lace than Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen
about it, she wore nothing but a rich Simarre. She car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd
in her hand a great Viol full of Jelly, Comfits, and
Conserves; and in this surprizing equipage she apper'd so
charming, that <hi>Don Pedro</hi> had like to have preferr'd the
pleasure of discovering himself to her, to all the ill effects
which so bold a presumption might have drawn upon him.
But he was wise in his love, and hid himself behind the
Well, tho he kept his eyes upon his Mistress all the while,
flattering himself sometimes that it was he she came to look
for. She walk'd directly towards the Stable, <hi>Don Pedro</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
her at some distance, and saw her go into a little
room. At first he was of opinion that his pious and chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Mistress went to visit one of her Domesticks that was
sick, 'tho without doing any wrong to her Charity, she
might have left that affair to any of her Women. He crept
behind a Horse, that stood not far from the Chamber-door,
and from thence observing his dear Widow, he saw her put
the Candlestick and Glass-Viol, and in short all she carry'd
in her Ivory hands upon a little Table; and in a sorry Bed,
which in a manner took up all the Room, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he beheld a sick
Negro, who seem'd to be about thirty years old, but so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
and ghastly, that he was frighted at the sight of him.
His face was as meagre as that of a Skeleton, and the poor
fellow had much difficulty to fetch his breath. <hi>Don Pedro</hi>
admir'd the unparallell'd goodness of the beautiful <hi>Elvira,</hi>
who took off all the Negro's Blankets, and having made his
Bed, sate down by the sick wretch, and put her hand upon
his forehead, that was all over in a cold sweat. The Negro
cast a dismal look upon the charitable Angel, that came to
comfort him, and seem'd to pity him with her eyes full of
tears. <hi>Don Pedro</hi> cou'd not tell what to think of so unexam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled
a strain of Charity, and after he had first admir'd it, he
began to alter his opinion, and concluded it was carry'd too
far. But as yet he had seen nothing. The charming Widow
first broke the silence, and weeping at such a rate as if it
were to be her last, she ask'd the Black how he found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self?
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:53808:193"/>
My dear <hi>Antonio,</hi> says she to him, in a voice interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with frequent sobs, art thou then resolv'd to die, and
wilt thou make me die too for company? Thou dost not
speak to me, my Life, my Jewel. Take courage, if thou
wou'dst have me live, and eat a little of this Jelly for my
sake: Thou wilt not so much as afford me one kind look,
cruel creature; me, I say, that love thee, me that adore
thee: Kiss me, my dear Angel, kiss me, and get well, if
thou wou'dst not have me to attend thee in thy death, after
I have so passionately lov'd thee in thy life. As she spoke
these tender words, she joyn'd her Angel's face to the dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical
visage of the Moor, which she moisten'd with her
tears. I fancy that any man that had seen so odd a sight,
wou'd have thought he had seen an Angel caress a Devil.
As for <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> he began to think the beautiful <hi>Elvira</hi> as
ugly as her Negro; who, at last casting his eyes upon his
importunate Lover, whom he did scarce vouchsafe to look
upon before, and with his lean bony hand turning away her
face from his, he thus spoke to her in a low feeble tone:
What wou'd you have me do, Madam? Will you not let
me die in quiet? Is it not enough that you have brought me
to the condition I am in, but must you force me, now
I am just dying, to throw away the little snuff of life that
is left me, to satisfie your libidinous appetite. Take a Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
and expect no more drudgery from me: I will see
you no more, nor eat any thing you have brought me, but
am resolv'd to die, since I am good for nothing else. When
he had said this, he sunk down in his bed, and the unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
<hi>Elvira</hi> cou'd not draw the least word from him, in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
to all the tender things she spoke, whether he
was already dead, or refus'd to speak to one, whom he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd
the cause of his death. <hi>Elvira</hi> wept like a Church-Spout
when it rains, and afflicted at the sad condition
wherein she left her beloved Negro, but much more at his
unkindness, took back with her every thing she had brought,
and walk'd towards her Chamber, but with so sorrowful and
sad an air, that it was her great misfortune that her future
Cuckold did not see her in that pickle. In the mean time
<hi>Don Pedro</hi> hid himself in the obscurest part of the Stable, so
confounded that he was not half a quarter so much, when
she was witness to <hi>Seraphina</hi>'s happy delivery. He saw this
monstrous Hypocrite go back the same way she came, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting
herself like any Widow at the Funeral of her dear
Husband; and some time after he heard the great Gate open,
and got into the street, not at all caring whether he was
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:53808:194"/>
seen or no, since he thought it not worth while to have any
regard for such a woman's reputation as <hi>Elvira.</hi> However,
he treated her like a Gentleman of Honour, and did not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
what he had seen to his friend. The next day he hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to pass by <hi>Elvira's</hi> Gate at the very instant the Moor
was carry'd out to be bury'd: Her Women told him that
their Mistress was sick; and for four or five days following,
as he pass'd to and fro before her Windows, she was not to
be seen there according to her custom, so inconsolable had
the death of her lovely <hi>African</hi> made her. <hi>Don Pedro</hi> was
mighty desirous to know how she fared. One day as he
was discoursing with <hi>Don Iuan,</hi> one of <hi>Elvira</hi>'s Slaves deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
him a Letter from his Mistress. He open'd it with
impatience, and read what follows.</p>

my Gallantry. I am somewhat scrupulous in my own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and therefore cannot in Conscience ask you to marry me so
soon, since you are a Widow of but a day's standing. You owe
more than that comes to, Madam, to the memory of the poor Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gro

loss of a person, who did you so considerable services. In the
mean while you and I shall have time enough to consider what we
have to do.</p>

courteously. This Unkle of his was a rich Cavalier, that
had an only Son, that was betrothed to a young Cousin that
was an only Daughter likewise, and who being but ten years

<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ind, and <hi>Don Pedro</hi> perceiving it, related all his adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:53808:195"/>
to him, that he might oblige him by this confidence
to communicate his to him, and if he had any occasion for
his service, to let him see, that he was much more his Friend
than his Relation. After this, he told him, that he had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
that somewhat sat uneasy upon him, and therefore
he begg'd him to let him know what it was; otherwise he
must believe that his friendship was not so hearty as his.
<hi>Don Rodrigo</hi> desir'd nothing more, hoping to receive some
relief in his inquietude, when he had once communicated it.
He therefore acquaints <hi>Don Pedro</hi> that he was passionately in
love with a Damosel of <hi>Madrid,</hi> who was promis'd to a Kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
whom she expected every hour from the <hi>Indies,</hi> but had
never seen, just as he was engag'd to a Cousin, and waited till
she was of age, of whom he had but little knowledge.
This conformity of Adventures, said he to <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> has
very much contributed to encrease the affection we have for
one another, altho at the same time it keeps us both in our
duty, whenever our passion advises us to prefer our satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
to those engagements, wherein the interests of our
Families have link'd us. Hitherto my love has made as fair
a progress with her as I cou'd wish, tho I have not as yet
been able to compass my desires, which she puts off till her
Husband's arrival, when her Marriage may secure both of us
from any ill consequences that may follow upon an Assig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
when we may probably do something else than dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
and talk. I will say nothing to you of the beauty of
<hi>Virginia,</hi> since 'tis impossible to say too much of it, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I shou'd be apt to say so much of it that you wou'd
not believe me. However, this I am certain of, that whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

you have seen her, and her Cousin <hi>Violanta</hi> who lives with
her, you will readily own, that all <hi>Spain</hi> cannot show any

you have convers'd a few moments with them, I will leave
you to tell me, whether you ever saw wittier Women in
your life. 'Tis this that makes me pity you, says <hi>Don Pedro</hi>
to him. And why so, reply'd <hi>Don Rodrigo?</hi> Because a woman
of Wit cries he, will most infallibly jilt you either sooner o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

soon weary of a woman's company if she was a Fool. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
'tis not reasonable, that whilst our eyes, our hands,
and in short all our body finds something to divert it, our
soul, which is the noblest part of the composition, shou'd
be forc'd to endure a tiresome insipid conversation, as that
of all persons must certainly be, that have no wit to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
it. Let us not carry this dispute as far as it will go,
cries <hi>Don Pedro</hi> to him, for a man may say too many things
upon so copious a subject. Only let me see this miracle of
a woman, and her Cousin as soon as you can, that if I don't
dislike her, I may have something to amuse my self with
during my stay in <hi>Madrid.</hi> I don't believe you'll find your
account in it, cries <hi>Rodrigo.</hi> And why so? replies <hi>Don Pedro.</hi>
Because, says the other, she is the only woman in the world
who is least a Fool. I will however suit my self to the time,
says <hi>Don Pedro.</hi> To tell you the truth, answers <hi>Don Rodri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go,</hi>
I don't know in what manner Madam <hi>Virginia</hi> will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
us. For these eight days last past she has us'd me most
unmercifully; she has sent me back all my Letters without
so much as opening them, and in short has given me to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
that she will never admit a visit from me, because
she saw me some time ago talking with a young Lady at
Church, in whose company she had seen me the same day at
the Play-house; and this is the reason why I have been of
late so melancholy. It signifies nothing, says <hi>Don Pedro,</hi>
let us go and see them, and take my word for't, you'll
sooner reconcile matters, by justifying your self to her face,
than by writing her a Cart-load of whining Letters. Thus
our two Gentlemen-Cousins went to visit the two Lady-Cousins,
and the beautiful <hi>Virginia</hi> gave <hi>Don Rodrigo</hi> leave
to clear himself, which was easily done. <hi>Don Pedro</hi> thought
both of them to be the handsomest women he had ever seen,
not excepting either the imprudent <hi>Seraphina,</hi> or the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critical
<hi>Elvira. Violanta,</hi> who had drest herself that day
in her finest Cloaths, because she was to sit for her Picture,
charm'd <hi>Don Pedro</hi> so effectually, that he immediately
broke the vow he had made, never to love any one but a
Fool. On his side he did not displease <hi>Violanta,</hi> and said
so many pretty engaging things to her upon the occasion of
her Picture, that she was no less satisfied with his Wit than
his Gallantry; and here I am obliged to make a short di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression,
and acquaint those that knew it not before, that
your mi<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hty retailers of Compliments and fine expressions,
generally deal in whipt Cream, and are justly accused of
bombast by men of Wit and Sense. If this small advice had
been consider'd by the public, they would have found it no
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:53808:196"/>
less useful than a Receit against Flies in the Summer, and
stinking breaths all the year round. <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> who had
solemnly swore by his Maker, that he would marry none
but a Fool, was now fully convinc'd, that Oaths made by
Gamesters and Lovers, signify just nothing. He was so
ravish'd with <hi>Violanta</hi>'s Wit, no less than her Beauty, that
finding he could obtain no other favours from her, but such
as she might grant without any prejudice to her honour, he
resolv'd to marry her, if she did not forbid the Banes. He
frequently gave her an occasion to explain her mind upon
this article, but either she did not, or wou'd not understand
him, whether it was because she lov'd her liberty, or had
an aversion to Matrimony. Thus all things went smoothly
on between these four young Lovers, and they only waited for
the critical minute. One day that they had spruced them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
up like <hi>Castor</hi> and <hi>Pollux,</hi> and made no question to be
Masters at least of all the Out-works they attack'd, a Servant
Maid, whose appearance boded worse luck than that of an
Owl, came to acquaint the two Cousins, that the <hi>Indian</hi>
Husband of the fair <hi>Castilian</hi> was arriv'd at <hi>Madrid,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
sending her any advice of his coming from <hi>Sevil,</hi> where
he landed: that the two Cousins concluded from thence
that he had a mind to surprize them, and therefore desir'd
our Lovers to fortifie themselves with patience, till such
time as <hi>Virginia</hi> had found out the humour of her <hi>Indian</hi>
Spark; and that they wou'd not only forbear to visit them,
but even to walk before their Windows, till they receiv'd
new orders. So all their tricking and powdering of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
that morning was thrown away, and the next two
days they had no more mind to dress, than a Criminal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd
to be hang'd. They learnt, among the other news
of the Town, that the <hi>Indian</hi> and <hi>Virginia</hi> were marry'd in
private, that he was very jealous in his own temper, that he
was a man of experience, having seen forty years; in fine, that
he had so order'd his family, and kept so strict a watch over
all <hi>Virginia</hi>'s actions, that her Gallants, if she had any,
must never expect to see her so much as at her Window.
The new orders, which had been promis'd them, did not
come, and they were impatient with expecting them.
They daily walk'd through the street, where their <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="5 letters">

They saw the Husband go into his H<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 span">

well made, and so young, that he was still at the Colledge.
This increas'd their ill humour: They went out early in
the morning, and came not home till it was very late, and
lost both their time and their labour. At last, upon a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Holyday, they saw <hi>Violanta</hi>'s Maid going to Mass by
break of day; they stopt her at the Church-Porch, and by
the never-failing Rhetoric of Money, <hi>Don Rodrigo</hi> perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
her to carry the following <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               <p>Your forgetting me does not more disoblige me, than my jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy
torments me, since it is without remedy, now you are under
the Government of a Husband. However, you are not totally
freed as yet from my importunities, altho you have discarded
me from your remembrance. The last favour I have to beg of
you, is, to inform me whether I have any reason still to hope,
or whether I must prepare to dye.</p>
               <p>They follow'd <hi>Violanta</hi>'s Maid at a distance. She deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
the Letter according to her promise, and making a
sign to them to draw near, she dropt the following Answer
from the Window into the Street.</p>
               <p>A jealous man so newly marry'd is never out of his Wive's
Company, and watches all her motions. He talks of taking a
journey to <hi>Valladolid</hi> shortly without me; I will then justify
myself, and pay my debts.</p>
               <p>This Billet, which they kist a hundred times, by the
same token that they strove which shou'd out-do the other,
gave them fresh encouragement, and made them easie e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
for a few days. But at last, hearing no news from
their cruel Mistresses, they began after their old laudable
custom to walk to and fro a hundred times a day before
their Windows; they pass'd whole nights in the street, but
cou'd not see a soul stir out of the house, no more than if it
had not been inhabited. One day, as these despairing Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
happen'd to be at Church, they had the good luck to see
our young Bride come towards them. <hi>Don Rodrigo</hi> kneel'd
down by her, under the nose of an old Gentleman Usher
that had Squir'd her to Church. He made his complaints
to her in a few words, she excus'd herself in like manner,
and at last told <hi>Don Rodrigo</hi> that her Husband was not to
go to <hi>Valladolid,</hi> altho he daily talk'd of it; that she was
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>mpatient to have a private conversation with him, and that
she only knew one way of bringing it about, which wholly
depended upon <hi>Don Pedro.</hi> My husband, says she, sleeps as
sound as if he took Opium every night, and we have not
exchang'd a word with one another these four or five days,
by reason of a small quarrel between us, which is not yet
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:53808:197"/>
made up. I had prevail'd with my Cousin <hi>Violanta</hi> to take
my place, but she's unhappily sick, and since none are privy
to our love but she and <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> and I wou'd not for all
the world have it communicated to more, you<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> must

it,) to supply her room, and go to bed to my Husband.
This attempt seems to be somewhat dangerous at first sight;
but if you consider that my good man and I are at odds, as
I have already told you, and that he does not easily wake, I
don't question bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> it will succeed to our expectation, and this
is all I can do for you. This happy Love-Stratagem, which
<hi>Don Rodrigo</hi> so earnestly desir'd to know, cool'd him in a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute
when he heard it. He not only doubted whether his
Cousin wou'd take upon him to act this dangerous part, but he
likewise doubted whether he ought so much as propose it to
him. His Mistress continu'd inflexible in her resolution,
and as she took her leave of him she protested to him, that
in case the Proposal she had made him was not well recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
and executed in the manner she directed him, he had
nothing more to hope from her, nay, that she gave him full
leave to banish her out of his remembrance, altho at another
time she wou'd as soon consent to her own death. Neither
the time nor place wou'd permit <hi>Don Rodrigo</hi> to talk any
longer with his Mistress. She went home, and <hi>Don Rodrigo</hi>
repair'd to his companion, who cou'd not get a word out of
him, so much confounded he was at the unhappy Dilemma
wherein he found himself, either to make so unreasonable a
request to his friend, or to live without enjoying that happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
which is always more esteem'd before possession than
after it. At last, shutting themselves up in their Chamber,
<hi>Don Rodrigo,</hi> after he had for a whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e refus'd to declare his
grievance, open'd the above-mention'd proposal to <hi>Don Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dro,</hi>
gilding the Pill as well as he bou'd, to make it go down
the better with him. At first <hi>Don Pedro</hi> thought that he had
a mind to banter him, but his Cousin protesting the contrary
in a very serious air, and confirming it by so many Oaths,
that he cou'd no longer doubt of it, he must needs turn the
thing into raillery, and told him he was exceedingly oblig'd
to his Mistress, for designing him such good fortune with
so lovely a Bed-fellow, and that it was undoubtedly the effect
of <hi>Violanta</hi>'s gratitude, who, not being in a condition to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
his services, because she was sick, and being prest to
pay her debts, turn'd it over to her Cousin's Husband, with
whom he shou'd certainly pass the night very agreeably.
He talk'd much to the same purpose, and jested a long
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:53808:197"/>
while, sometimes well, and sometimes but indifferently.
But <hi>Don Rodrigo</hi> was not in a humour to be merry, and he
appear'd so dejected and melancholy to his Cousin, that he
heartily pity'd him, and was afraid that his despair wou'd
carry him to some dangerous resolutions. <hi>Don Pedro</hi> was
bold in his temper, a great lover of Intrigues, and no man
so ready as he to engage in any extravagant adventure: he
lov'd <hi>Don Rodrigo</hi> tenderly, so that all this joyn'd together
made him resolve to supply the room of the beautiful <hi>Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi>
whatever her jealous Husband might do to him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
therefore fully determin'd upon the matter, he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brac'd
his Cousin, and put fresh life into him, when he
assur'd him that he wou'd hazard all that he might enjoy his
beloved Mistress. You will not, added he, be so much oblig'd
to me as you think: I consider it as an honourable action,
wherein I pretend to get as much reputation, as if I shou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

signalize my self at a breach. Word was sent to <hi>Virginia</hi>
that her proposal was accepted; she appointed that very e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening
to put it in execution: The two Cousins went to her
house, and were introduc'd with as little noise as was
possible. <hi>Don Pedro</hi> was oblig'd by the fair Lady of the
Enchanted Castle to undress himself before her, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd
that her orders shou'd not be transgress'd in the least.
<hi>Don Pedro</hi> having nothing on now but his shirt, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted
by her with all the care and circumspection imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the fatal room, and opening the Curtains, the softly
put the bold <hi>Don Pedro</hi> between the sheets, who perhaps at
that very moment repented for having gone so far, and
one may swear did not throw himself into the middle of the
Bed. She went away, lock'd the Chamber door, which put
<hi>Don Pedro</hi> into cruel apprehensions, and repaired to <hi>Don
Rodrigo,</hi> to whom I suppose she paid, like a woman of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
all that she ow'd him, or at least as much as he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
of her. In the mean time <hi>Don Pedro</hi> was in diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
circumstances from those of his Cousin, who threw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
into the arms of his charming Mistress, while our too
charitable and adventurous Friend, fear'd nothing so much as
the embraces of a detestable man, whom to his great sorrow
he was like to find a very uncomfortable Bed-fellow. He
then began to consider, but it was somewhat of the latest, to
what hazards his foolish rashness had carried him. He
blamed himself, he called himself Fool a thousand times in
his thoughts, and was sensible that to transgress thus against
any Husband, was an unpardonable crime, tho even he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
were to be judge. These melancholy reflexions were
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:53808:198"/>
disturbed, and his just fears increased, by a great villain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
arm which his Companion in bed threw over him, draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> his body out of the bed, so that he had like to

for exposing himself to such dangers, to serve the passion of
two indiscreet Lovers. He had scarce begun to breathe a
little, when his troublesome Bed-fellow laid his Leg over
his, and this last action, as well as the former, had like to
have made him dye with fear. In short, the one still draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
nearer, and the other getting off as far as he cou'd, the
day appear'd just at the time when the unfortunate <hi>Don Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dro</hi>
was no longer able to keep his ground against a man,
who still drove him farther. He arose as softly as might be,
and went to open the door, which he found lock'd, a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
misfortune than any had yet befallen him. As he was
endeavouring in vain to open it, it flew open all on the sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
and had like to have broke his Nose. <hi>Virginia</hi> came
boldly into the Chamber, and ask'd him aloud, Whither he
was going in such haste? <hi>Don Pedro</hi> conjur'd her in a low
voice not to make such a noise, and ask'd her whether she had
not lost her sences, to venture the waking of her Husband
thus, and desir'd her to let him go. How, go! says the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
aloud to him, I am resolv'd my Husband shall see whom
he has lain with to night, that he may know what his jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e
has brought him to, and what I am capable of doing.
When she had said this, as bold as a Lyoness, she took <hi>Don
Pedro</hi> by the arm, who was so confounded, that he had not
strength enough to get loose from her, open'd the Window-Shutters,
without quitting her hold, and pulling him to the
Bed-side, drew the Curtains, and cry'd out aloud, See, jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d his eyes towards the terrible Bed, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of an ugly fellow with a beard, he beheld his charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Violanta,</hi> who had lain by his side all night, and not the
jealous Husband of <hi>Virginia,</hi> who had gone into the Country
about eight days before. The two pretty Cousins pelted
him with their raillery; never did man of wit make so lame
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> defence, or say so little for himself. <hi>Violanta,</hi> who was
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:53808:198"/>
naturally gay, and rally'd with a grace, had like to have
made her Cousin dye with laughing, when she pleasantly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aggerated
to her what bodily fears she put poor <hi>Don Pedro</hi>
in, as often as she made as if she were awake, and drew
nearer to him. It was a long time before <hi>Don Pedro</hi> cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d
recover out of this confusion, and set his countenance in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
At last <hi>Virginia</hi> took compassion of him, and left him
alone with her Cousin, with whom we may suppose he had
affairs of great importance to settle, because he was shut up
with her till noon. From this happy hour, all the while
the Husband stay'd in the Country, the two Gentlemen-Cousins
and the two Gentlewomen-Cousins met frequently
together, and made the best use of their time. When the
Husband came to Town again, <hi>Rodrigo</hi> was the less happy of
the two, for <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> by the charitable assistance of the
Servants, whom his presents had brought over to his side,
made a shift for two or three months to pass most of the
nights with <hi>Violanta,</hi> who was mistress of her own actions,
and ever since the marriage of her Cousin lodg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d in a sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
building, which had a door into another street. He
became so passionately in love with her, that he earnestly
desir'd to marry her; but whenever he made any such pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal
to her she turn'd off the discourse so dexterously, that
he cou'd not positively tell whether she did it out of design,
or because she did not listen to him. In short, as there is
nothing permanent in this transitory world, <hi>Violanta</hi> began
to slacken in her passion, and grew cold by little and little,
so that <hi>Don Pedro</hi> cou'd not forbear to complain of it, and
not knowing how to account for this alteration otherwise,
accus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d her of infidelity, and reproach'd her with having
some other Gallant more happy than himself. Instead of
mending matters by this procedure he utterly ruin'd them,
and made himself so insupportable to <hi>Violanta,</hi> that she not
only refus'd to see him a nights, but likewise to admit his
visits in the day time. This treatment did not in the least
discourage him; he gain'd by vertue of his Money one of
her Maids, who was so treacherous as to inform him, that
her Mistress was passionately in love with her Cousin's Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-in-law,
who had just left the Colledge; that he was a
very handsome youth, and no less in love with <hi>Violanta,</hi>
than <hi>Violanta</hi> was with him. To compleat her perfidious
treachery, this ill-condition'd Devil advis'd him to pretend
himself sick, to acquaint her Mistress with his illness, and
complain of her for being the cause of it, which was likely
enough; and in short to f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that had no aversion to pleasure. She inform'd herself par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
of the Gallantry of <hi>Naples,</hi> desir'd to know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the women there were allow'd any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>iberty, and whether
the <hi>Italian</hi> Gallants carry'd on their amours as bravely as
those of <hi>Spain.</hi> At last <hi>Don Pedro</hi> confirm'd himself by the
questions she put to him, that if she did not go to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
of an Intrigue, 'twas not for want of good will. She
made him dine with her, to the mutual satisfaction of both.
Our <hi>Granada</hi> Adventurer wou'd have taken his leave of her
after dinner, but she wou'd not suffer it, and told him,
that since the Duke her Husband wou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d not come home that
day, she desir'd him to be her Guest; adding obligingly,
that pers<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ns of merit were very rare in <hi>Catalonia;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when she had the happiness to meet them, no wonder
she coveted to enjoy their conversation as long as she cou'd.
She led him into a large Closet, very cool and refreshing,
adorn'd with fine Pictures, China, and other rich furniture.
It wanted not, since we are oblig'd to be particular, a noble
Alcove, embroider'd Cushions, and a convenient Couch,
with a rich Sattin Quilt thrown over it. Here our Traveller
recounted to her all his adventures <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>at <hi>Granada, Sevil,</hi> and
<hi>Madrid,</hi> together with those of <hi>Italy,</hi> which are not as yet
arriv'd to my knowledge. The Dutchess listned very atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
to them; at last he told her that he was resolv'd to
marry, if he cou'd find a woman fool enough, from whom he
should have no reason to apprehend any of those ill offices,
which witty women are able to do their Husbands. I have
an estate, continues he, that is far from being contemptible,
and tho the woman I marry does not bring me a farthing,
provided she has been well educated, and is not deform'd, I
shall make no scruple to choose her; altho, to deal ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
with you, I wou'd much sooner choose a woman that
is deform'd, provided she is fool enough, than one that is
handsome, and is not so. You are certainly wrong in your
notious, replies the Dutchess; but what do you mean by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
well educated? I mean a woman of vertue, answered
our Traveller; And how is it possible for a Fool, to be a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of vertue, cries the Dutchess, if she neither knows what
vertue is, nor is capable of being taught it? Besides how can
a Fool love you, that has not sense enough to know your me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit?
She will trespass against her duty, without knowing
what she does, whereas a woman of Wit, altho she shou'd
dist<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ust her honour, will know how to avoid those occasion<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
where she may run any danger of losing it. They argued along
while <hi>Pro</hi> and <hi>Con</hi> upon this subject; our <hi>Don</hi> maintaining
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:53808:199"/>
that all the knowledge required in a woman was to love her
Husband, to be faithful to him, and carefully look after
her Family affairs and Children; and the Dutchess endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
to convince him that a Fool was not capable of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it, nay, that tho she was beautiful, she wou'd certainly
disgust him at last. They gave one another several proofs
of their Wit, and the good opinion they had of one another
soon improved into esteem, nay, and something better than
that. Our <hi>Spaniard</hi> did not only differ from the Duke in
age, wit, and person, but was one of the handsomest best<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shaped
men in the World, and if he appeared as such to the
Dutchess, he thought her the loveliest woman he had ever
beheld. He was as bold as a Lyon, and never found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
alone with a woman, but he presented his service to her.
If she accepted it, he did his best to acquit himself, and if
she took snuff at it, he wou'd fall you down upon his Marrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bones,
and calling himself the horridst Sinner in the world,
ask pardon so ingeniously, and with so much Hypocrisy, that
the Lady must needs pardon his transgression, or perhaps by
way of atonement make him trangress again. I cou'd never
have imagined, says he to the charming Dutchess, that any
one was able to make me throw up an opinion, the truth of
which so many experiments have confirmed to me, but it
was never yet opposed by so extraordinary a person as your
self, whose Soul, without being beholden to her beauty,
which however is not to be matched in the Universe, may
acquire her as large an Empire as she pleases, over all those
that have wit enough to discover, that she has a greater
share of it than all her Sex put together. You have cured
me of an errour, added he, but you leave me troubled with
an illness, which is so much the more dangerous and hard
to cure, as I am pleased to have it, and by suffering it gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify
the noblest ambition that a mortal is capable of. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
positively tell you, how many other Hyperboles he shot
against the Dutches<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es virtue, and whether he did not speak
abundance of pathetical impertinences, for upon such occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
as this, a man is most terribly given to be impertinent.
Neither do I know in what manner the Dutchess received a
declaration of love, which her Gallant delivered in due
form, I mean whether she seemed to like it by an answer sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to the occasion, or whether by answering nothing, she
made good the old Proverb, <hi>Silence gives consent.</hi> But this
is certain, that a Maid of hers, who died of the Kings Evil
in <hi>France,</hi> often owned before several credible Gentlemen,
that the closet door was shut for some two hours upon them,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:53808:200"/>
that they were together till Supper time, and altho this
Maid, whom I suppose to have been an <hi>Andalusian,</hi> had never
told me this, yet I know full well, that opportunity makes
a Thief. The night came, that favourable Goddess to stolen
love, but neither was <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> nor the Dutchess the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for it, for partly out of good manners, and partly not
to give the Servants an occasion to guess, who generally
guess beyond the truth, to which they have a natural Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy,
they called for Candles, which were almost eclipsed
by the brighter eyes Heaven had bestowed upon the Dutchess,
and which at that moment twinkled prettier than any pair
of Stars in the Firmament. The vermillion of her Cheeks
was double to what it used to be, which made her appear
brighter than the Sun on a fine Summers day to <hi>Don Pedro,</hi>
whose visage too was a little inclined to Scarlet. Thus they
merrily past away the time in exchanging glances with one
another, when a Servant came to acquaint the Dutchess,
that his Grace her Husband was below in the Court. All
that she cou'd do in this surprize, was to shut up the thrice
astonished <hi>Don Pedro</hi> in a large gilt cup-board, where she
kept her perfumed waters, and putting the Key in her
pocket, to throw herself upon the Bed. The Duke, who
was at least threescore years old came into his Wive's Closet,
and found her as gay and fresh as a Rose upon the stalk.
He told her, that he had received a Letter from the King,
which obliged him to return sooner than he thought. He
was very hungry, and ordered the Servants to bring what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they had ready in the House, into the same Closet, and
the Dutchess, who had no great Stomach to eat, while her
Traveller, perhaps wished himself ten foot under ground,
took a chair near the Table. She was exceeding chearful and
brisk, and of a gayety, that bestowed new youth upon her
old Husband, so much did it revive his Spirits. It was a
customary thing for her to lay extravagant wagers with him,
but especially when she wanted money, which her good man
took a pleasure to loose to her, being perfectly charmed with
so agreeable a Wife. He never fancied her more beautiful
than then; she told him a hundred merry stories, by the same
token, that our Duke had like to have choaked himself with
laughing at 'em, for eating heartily and laughing heartily at
the same time, a bit of meat happened to go down the
wrong way, but Heaven be praised, it did him no harm.
At last the Dutchess, who was of a humour to turn every
thing into merriment, had a mind to divert herself at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
of her gallant in the Sweating-tub: Says she to the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:53808:200"/>
Duke, methinks it is a long while since we laid a wager last,
now I would fain lay a hundred Pistoles, that I have occasion
for, upon the first subject, that offers itself. The Duke
told her he was ready, and that he wou'd leave it to her,
to propose any subject. The Dutchess proposed several
to him, which she knew he wou'd not accept, and at
last asked him, whether he wou'd lay a wager, that he cou'd
reckon up all the things in a Family that are made of Iron.
The Duke took her at her word, tho he thought it a very
foolish thing to lay a wager on, and calling for Paper and
Ink, so soon as the Cloath was remov'd, and his Chaplain
had said Grace, (for the Duke you must know kept a good
decorum in his family) he writ down the names of all the
Iron utensils he cou'd think of, but it fell out luckily for
the Dutchess, that he forgot to mention a Key. She got him
to read over what he had written two or three times,
and when he had done so, ask'd him if he was satisfy'd with
it, and whether he had any thing to add? She then folded
the paper, telling him she wou'd examine it at her leisure,
and that she wou'd relate to him one of the prettiest adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
he had ever heard. A little after you were gone out
upon your sport, I was, continues she, looking out of one
of our windows that faces the high Road, when I saw a
man of an extraordinary mien mounted on a Mule, who
prickd and spurr'd his Beast to make all the haste he cou'd.
I had the curiosity to know whither he was going in so much
haste, and dispatch'd one of my Pages to tell him I wou'd
speak with him. To be plain with you, I never in all my
life saw a man better made, or more likely to make even
a woman of vertue dispence with a conjugal vow. I ask'd
him whence he came, and who he was? he answer'd me so
genteely, and with so much wit, that I was desirous to have
more of his Conversation. So I engaged him to stay with
me the remainder of the day, and to acquaint me with all
his Adventures, which must certainly be very curious and
entertaining, as I imagin'd. He perform'd it to my expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and I must frankly own to you, that I was never bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
diverted with any History in my life, and I am resolv'd,
says she, to divert your grace with it likewise. Then she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
to the Duke all that had happen'd to <hi>Don Pedro</hi> at
<hi>Granada, Sevil,</hi> and <hi>Madrid,</hi> and her good man, who was
as merry a Wight, as 'tis possible for a Duke to be, fell a
laughing, as if he wou'd have burst his hoops, which made
the Dutchess and some of his chief Servants, whom he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
to be familiar with him, joyn in this merry con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:53808:201"/>
After this she acquainted him, with all that had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen
our <hi>Granada</hi>-Gentleman in <hi>Italy,</hi> which was very
pleasant as I have been told, for I cou'd never inform my
self what the particulars were. All I know is, that the
Duke laugh'd as heartily at them, and that <hi>Don Pedro</hi> himself
could not forbear laughing in the Chest. In short, after she
had very well diverted herself by making her Husband
laugh, and all the company, and <hi>Don Pedro</hi> into the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
who till now had had his share in the Mirth, she told
her Husband that our Traveller, after he had recounted all
his adventures to her, was so hardy as to make love to her,
and did it with so much address, that she could not find
in her heart to be angry with him for carrying his
Gallantry so far, who could not but perceive that he was by
no means displeasing to her. But why should I multiply
words in vain, continued the Dutchess, a Gentleman so
well made as he is may attempt any thing without danger.
We passed the greatest part of the day together, to our mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
satisfaction, and we had done so still, but that you came
home when I little expected you. Not to mince matters,
your return both afflicted and surpriz'd me. My lovely
Stranger seem'd to be in a greater consternation than my self,
so I hastily shut him up in my Chest of perfum'd Waters,
from whence he must needs hear me, if he is not already
dead with fear. But knowing what an ascendant I have
over you, and being in my own temper uncapable of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling
even those very things, where my too great free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
may do me harm, I was resolved to divert you at the
expence of this poor Gentleman, whom I will draw out of
his hole, so soon as you are gone to your own apartment,
and leave him to pursue his Journey to <hi>Granada,</hi> where he
is going, as he tells us, to find out a woman, who is Fool
enough it seems to deserve to be his Wife. The Dutchess
gave such an air of probability to this true story, that the
Duke quitted his good humour, and turn'd serious all on
the sudden. He look'd pale, he was afraid that what
his Wife had told him was true, and could not forbear
asking for the Key<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of the Chest, wherein, as she pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
the Stranger was shut up. She changed the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
and by that means encreased his suspicion and his
fears. He asked her once more for the Keys of the Chest,
which she refused him. He was resolved to have them, and
arose from his seat in a passion. Very well, Sir, very well,
said the Dutchess to him, before you ask me for the Keys
in such haste, pray be pleased cooly and calmly to read o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:53808:201"/>
your Catalogue; you have forgot to set down Keys in
it, you cannot deny but that they are made of Iron, and that
you owe me a hundred Pistoles upon the wager. Pray
give 'em me now, as you are obliged in honour, and take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
that if I have told you a merry story, 'twas only to
put you in mind of what you had lost, and at the same time
to divert you, that you might part the freer with your
money. The next time I wou'd have you to be more wise,
than to take an invented story for a true one. 'Twas not
probable that so many extraordinary adventures should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall
one single man, and much less so, that I would have told
you such a story if it had been true. He laugh'd as if he
had been distracted, he admir'd the prodigious wit of his
Wife, and commended it before his Servants, who were
perhaps as arrant fools as himself. See now, cries he as
loud as he was able, and laughed at the same time, see now
by what a cunning fetch the Gypsie has told me that I have
lost. The Dutchess had lik'd to have kill'd her self with
laughing, her Woman seconded her, and <hi>Don Pedro</hi> was half
dead with stifling his laughter in the Chest. At last, the Duke,
after he had order'd the Steward to pay his Wife a hundred
Pistoles, leaves her to go to his own Apartment, often say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to himself that she was a true Devil, and sometimes that
she had the Wit of a Devil. The Duke's Servants repeated
the same words after their master, so that all the while
the Duke was going towards his Chamber, you cou'd hear
nothing else upon the stairs, but different voices, crying, my
Lady Dutchess has the wit of Devil, my Lady Dutchess is a
true Devil. In the mean time the Steward paid the Dutchess
her 100 Pistoles, and went his way. The Dutchess shut her
Chamber door, and freeing <hi>Don Pedro</hi> out of his little ease,
who had scarce recover'd out of his fright, she endeavour'd
to convince him, that a woman of Wit cou'd disengage herself
with honour out of a scurvy business, the very thoughts of
which wou'd have made a fool dye with fear. She wou'd
have had him take part of a Collation, which her women
had just set upon the Table; but he begg'd her pardon, and
desir'd her to let him go. She gave him the hundred Pistoles
she had won of her Husband, with a Gold Chain and her
Picture, that were worth as much more, conjuring him not
to forget her, but to let her hear from him now and then. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this she tenderly embrac'd him, and put him into the
hands of her Maids, who let him and his Mule out privately
by a back door. He did not think it convenient to lye in that
place, but rode two leagues further till he came to the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:53808:202"/>
Town, where he intended to have dined the day before, if
the Dutchess had not stopt him. This odd adventure, with
the <hi>Catalonian</hi> Dutchess, ran perpetually in his head. Be
could not enough wonder at her falling in love with him so
on the sudden before she knew him, at her rashness in relating
to the Duke a story so nice, but so true, and last of all at her
great address in applying it to her wager. He likewise ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir'd
the good temper of the Duke, he pitied his conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and fortified himself more than ever in his opinion,
that a woman of wit was hard to be looked after, and
doubted not but that if the Dutchess had not too much
relied upon the goodness of her invention, she durst never
have carried on her intrigue so far, nor had the boldness
to communicate it to her Husband. He promis'd himself
that he would never run any such risque of being ill-mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried,
because he wou'd either take no Wife at all, or if he
did, pitch upon one that was so foolish, that she should
not be able to distinguish between Love and Aversion. As
he was making these wise reflexions, he arrived at <hi>Madrid,</hi>
where he found his Cousin <hi>Don Rodrigo,</hi> had inherited his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
Estate, and was married to his Kinswoman. He was
informed by him that <hi>Violanta</hi> had disposed of herself in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony,
and that the beautiful <hi>Virginia,</hi> was gone to the
<hi>Indies</hi> with her Husband. From <hi>Madrid</hi> he arrived at <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada.</hi>
The first visit he paid was to his Aunt, who welcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him with a thousand embraces, and told him that <hi>Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phina</hi>
lived like a Saint, and that her Lover had died of
grief, because he could not perswade her to quit the Cloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
to marry him. Next day he went in company with
his Aunt to see the young <hi>Laura, Seraphina</hi>'s Daughter. She
had been put into a Convent when she was but four years
old, and then might be about sixteen. He found her as
beautiful as all the Angels put together, and as foolish as
all the Nuns that come into the world without Brains, and
are taken out of it in their Infancy, to be buried alive in a
Convent. He gazed upon her, and was charm'd by her
beauty; he made her talk, and admired her innocence. He
now flatter'd himself that he had found out what he had been
so long looking after, and what made him take a greater
fancy to <hi>Laura,</hi> was that she much resembled <hi>Seraphina,</hi>
with whom he had once been passionately in love, tho the
Copy infinitely exceeded the Original. He told his Aunt
that she was not his Daughter, and acquainted her with
his resolution to marry her. The old Gentlewoman approved
his choice, and communicated the good news to <hi>Laura,</hi>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:53808:202"/>
who neither rejoyced, nor was sad at it. <hi>Don Pedro</hi> furnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his house, look'd out for the most foolish Servants he
could find: He likewise endeavour'd to get a set of
Maids, full as great fools as <hi>Laura,</hi> which gave him no
small trouble. He presented his Mistress with the richest
Cloaths and the finest things that <hi>Granada</hi> could afford. All
persons of quality in the Town were invited to the Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
and were as much pleased with <hi>Laura</hi>'s Beauty, as
they were disgusted at her Simplicity. The company broke
up very early, and our new couple were left alone by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
<hi>Don Pedro</hi> sent his Servants to bed, and ordering his
Wife's Maids to retire, so soon as they had undrest her, shut
the Chamber door. And now the Devil put it into his head
to execute the most nonsensical frolic, that ever man was
guilty of, who had past all his life for a man of sense. He
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

him, and spoke the following words to her, or others
much more impertinent. You are my Wife, and I hope I
shall have reason to bless God for't, so long as we live toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

                  </gap>e. At these words the Innocent <hi>Laura</hi> made many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
Courtsies to him, whether seasonably or no it signifies
nothing; and with her two little roguy blinking eyes, she
look'd as fearfully upon her Husband, as a new Scholar does

<hi>Don Pedro,</hi> how marry'd people ought to live? Not I,
forsooth, reply'd <hi>Laura,</hi> dropping him a Courtsie
much lower than all the rest, but if you'll teach me, I'll
remember it better than my <hi>Ave Mary;</hi> and then she dropt
him another. <hi>Don Pedro</hi> thought himself the happiest man

This was enough to so experienced a Bawd as ours was, to

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>onvince her that <hi>Laura</hi> was simplicity it self. She there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
endeavoured to explain to her as well as she was able,
in what manner this Gentleman desired to serve her: She
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>old her that he was full as rich as her Husband, and that
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>f she had a mind to see any proofs of it, she would bring
her from him the finest Jewels, and the richest Cloaths that
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ould be. Alas! Madam, says <hi>Laura,</hi> I have so much of
what you talk of, that I don't know where to put them.
Since 'tis so, answer'd this Ambassadress of Satan, and you
don't care that he should present you, suffer him at least to
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>isit you. He may do that, says <hi>Laura,</hi> when he pleases,
no one will hinder him. That is as well as may be, replies
this venerable Bawd, but yet it would be much better still,
if your Footmen and Maids knew nothing of it. That's
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>asy enough, answer'd <hi>Laura,</hi> for my Maids don't lye in my
Chamber, I go to bed without their help, and very late.
Take this Key which opens all the rest in the House, and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:53808:204"/>
about eleven at night he may come in at the Garden-door,
where he will see a little Stair-case, that will lead him to
my Chamber. This old Beldame took her hands, and
kiss'd them a hundred times, telling her she was going to
bestow new life upon this poor Gentleman, whom she had
left a dying. And how came that about? cries <hi>Laura</hi> all
in a fright. Why 'tis you that have killed him, replies this
dissembling Gipsy. <hi>Laura</hi> looked as pale as if she had been
convicted of Murder, and was going to declare her innocence,
if this wicked woman, who did not think it convenient to
abuse her ignorance any longer, had not left her, throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her arms about her neck, and assuring her that the sick
man would not dye. You may imagin she understood her
Trade too well to forget the miraculous Key that could
open all the doors. Some malapert Critick now will fall
upon my bones for this Key, and tell me, 'tis all over witch-craft,
and smells of a Fable; but let him know from his
most humble and most obliged Servant, that the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
in <hi>Spain</hi> have such sorts of Keys, which they call <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresses,</hi>
and that in the days of yore people were better
bred and more civil than to blame what they did not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand.
Let him maul fore-stroke and back-stroke, all that
falls within the compass of his little Capacity, but I shou'd
be reckoned as great a Coxcomb as he, to trouble my head
any more about him. To return then to our old Matron: She
went to find out the impatient Lover, and told him with an
infernal sneer, what progress she had made in his business<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
he rewarded her like a liberal Gentleman, and expected the
night with impatience. The night at last arrived, he open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Garden-door, and stole up as softly as he could to
<hi>Laura</hi>'s Chamber, at the time when this silly creature was
walking up and down in her room, arm'd at all points,
with a Lance in her hand, according to the salutary instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of her extravagant Husband. There was only a
small light in a corner of the Room, and the door stood
open, without question to receive the <hi>Cordovan</hi> Gallant.
But our Spack seeing a person all in Armour, did not
doubt but that they design'd to get him in their clutches<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
His fear then prevailed over his love, as violent as it was
and away he fled faster than he came, fearing that he
should not get into the street soon enough. He went to his
trusty Goer-between, and inform'd her what a hazard he
had run, who being mightily concerned at what had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened,
went directly to <hi>Laura</hi>'s house, to discourse her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the matter. Our silly Innocent no sooner saw her, but
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:53808:204"/>
she askt her why the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>entleman did not come, and whether
he was still sick? He is not sick, replies old Iniquity, but
came to wait on you last night, and saw an armed man in
your Chamber. At this <hi>Laura</hi> made a long-winded laugh,
then she fell into a second fit, and then into a third, and all this
while the old woman cou'd not tell what to make on't. At
last, when she had fully satisfy'd herself with laughing, and
was at liberty to talk, she told the Reverend Beldame, that
it was plain the Gentleman was not married, and that it
was she who walked all arm'd in her Chamber. Our vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
Matron could not imagin what to make of these
words, and for a pretty while believed that <hi>Laura</hi> was a
downright natural, but after she had put several questions
to her, she came to understand, what she could not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
have believed, as well the great simplicity of a Girl
of fifteen, who ought to have known what was what
at that age, as the extravagant precaution her Husband
used, to secure his Wives Chastity. However, she thought it
best to leave <hi>Laura</hi> in her error, and instead of showing
herself surprized at the novelty of the thing, as much as she
was, she fell a laughing with <hi>Laura,</hi> at the great fright the
Gallant had been in. A meeting was appointed that night,
the old woman encouraged the Gallant, and admir'd as well
as he at the strange stupidity of our Husband and his Wife.
The night came, he got into the Garden, crept up the little
Stair-case, and found his Lady in Armour, performing her
Conjugal Duty, as she thought He embrac'd her all covered
with Iron as she was, and for her part she received him, as
if she had known him from her Cradle. At last he enquired
of her what she designed to do in this Armour. She fell
a laughing, and told him that she durst not take it off, nor
pass the night in any other Equipage; and inform'd him,
since it seems he knew it not, that it was a Mortal sin to
do otherwise. Our charitable wheedling <hi>Cordovan</hi> took a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance
of pains to undeceive the poor Creature, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
her that she was abused, and that married persons
passed their time after another manner. At last he prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with her to disarm, and to learn a more easy and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
way of performing the duties of Matrimony, than her
Husband had taught her, which <hi>Laura</hi> own'd to be a cruel
fatigue. He was not long in getting off her Armour, he
likewise helpt her to unrig, finding she was too long about
it herself, and then threw himself into the bed by her side,
where he made her confess that Chalk and Cheese were not
more different than his precepts of Matrimony, and those of
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:53808:205"/>
her Husband. In short, he taught <hi>Laura</hi> all that he knew; who
for her part was not backward to learn it, while her Husband
danc'd attendance at Court. At last she receiv'd a Letter
from him, wherein he sent her word, that his business being
at last over, he was now preparing to come home: and at
the same time our <hi>Cordovan</hi> having dispatched his affairs at
<hi>Granada</hi> return'd to <hi>Cordova,</hi> without taking leave of <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi>
being, as I suppose, not very much concern'd to part
with her, since nothing is so short-liv'd as our love of a fool.
<hi>Laura</hi> was not much mortify'd at it, and receiv'd her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
with as much joy, and with as little concern for the
loss of her Gallant, as if she had never seen him. <hi>Don Pedro</hi>
and his Wife supt together, to their mutual satisfaction.
The night was now pretty well spent: <hi>Don Pedro</hi> went to
bed according to his custom, and you may judge what a sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
he was in, when he saw his pretty Consort in her smock
coming to lye by him. Being much disturb'd in his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
spirit, he ask'd her why she was not in her Armour?
Oh, says she, I know a much better way of passing the night
with one's Husband, which my other Husband taught me,
I thank him. What, have you got another Husband? re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
<hi>Don Pedro.</hi> Yes, says she, and so fine and handsome a
Husband too, let me tell you, that you'd be pleas'd to see
him; but in truth I don't know when we shall see him,
for ever since the last Letter you sent me he has not been
here. <hi>Don Pedro</hi> dissembling his vexation, ask'd her who
he was? but she could not resolve him that question, and
like a loving Tit propos'd to <hi>Don Pedro</hi> to shew him what a
pretty Game her other Husband had taught her. Our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate
Gentleman pretended to be sick, and perhaps was
so, at least in mind. He turn'd his back to her, and chew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the cud upon the blessed choice he had made of a Wife,
who had not only violated the honour of his Bed, but had
not sense enough to conceal it from him, bethought himself
of the wholesome advice of the <hi>Catalonian</hi> Dutchess, detest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his errors, and own'd (but it was somewhat of the latest)
that a woman of Wit knows how to preserve the laws of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour;
or if out of weakness she breaks them, knows at least
how to keep her transgression private. At last he comforted
himself as well as he cou'd for a calamity that was not to be
redress'd: he feign'd to be indispos'd for some time, to see
whether the instructions of his Deputy wou'd have any
other effect than just teaching her a Lesson, which he had
done better to have taught her himself. He liv'd several
years with her, had always a watchful eye upon her acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:53808:205"/>
and when he dy'd left her all his Estate, upon condition
that she wou'd take the habit of a Nun, in the same Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
where <hi>Seraphina</hi> liv'd, who was inform'd by him that
<hi>Laura</hi> was her Daughter. He sent all the particulars of his
History to his Cousin <hi>Don Rodrigo</hi> at <hi>Madrid,</hi> and confess'd
to him how finely he had found himself mistaken in his erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous
opinion. He dy'd: <hi>Laura</hi> neither rejoic'd nor griev'd at
it. She enter'd herself in the same Convent where her Mother
liv'd; who finding what a great Estate <hi>Don Pedro</hi> had left
her Daughter, founded a Religious House with it. The
History of <hi>Don Pedro</hi> was divulg'd after his death, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd
all those people, who doubted of it before, that ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
cannot be perfect without good sense, that a Witty Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
may be honest of herself, but that a Fool cannot be so
without assistance, and good looking after.</p>

               <p>IT was at that lovely season of the year, when <hi>Flora</hi> and
<hi>Apollo,</hi> no, I beg your pardon, <hi>Apollo</hi> and <hi>Flora,</hi> dress
the Earth in her gayest livery, that a Woman arriv'd at
<hi>Toledo,</hi> the most ancient and most renowned City of
<hi>Spain.</hi> She was fair and young, as subtle as the old Serpent,
and so great an enemy to truth, that for several years she ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
suffer'd that vertue to approach her lips; and what is
more wonderful, she did not find herself a jot the worse for
it, at least she never complain'd of it. Thus she traffick'd in
lies, and generally made a good market of them; for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is more certain, than that a Cheat of our Heroine's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion
has sometimes stole herself into the approbation even
of those persons, who have a mortal aversion to falshood.
She had a magazine of fiction large enough to furnish all the
Poets, Heralds, Vision-mongers, Quacks and Astrologers in
Christendom. In short, this natural qualification, which
she had taken care to cultivate from her infancy, joyn'd to
the charms of her face, had got her in a short time a fine par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel
of Pistoles. Her eyes were black, lively, sweet, large,
as fine as fine cou'd be, but most notorious killers, convict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of some four or five murders, suspected of fifty more that
were not sufficiently proved upon them; and as for the
wretches they had wounded, their numbers cou'd not be
computed, nor even imagin'd. No woman in the Universe
drest finer than she; the least pin set on by her hand carry'd a
particular charm with it. She advis'd with no other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor
as to her dress but her Looking-glass, which was her
Chief Minister of State, her Treasurer, and Father Confessor.
She was a most dangerous woman to see, that's certain, for a
man cou'd not for the heart of him help loving her, and
cou'd not be long her Gallant, without being her Slave as
long. Well, our Lady, such as I have describ'd her to you,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:53808:206"/>
arriv'd at <hi>Toledo</hi> towards the evening, iust at the very nick
of time when all the Cavaliers of the City were preparing a
Masquerade for the Wedding of a young Gentleman of the
neighbourhood, who was to marry a Lady, descended of one
of the best Families in that City. The Windows were illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated
with Torches, but much more with the brighter
eyes of the fair Ladies, and the incredible number of Wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
triumph'd o're the vanquish'd night, and restor'd ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
day. Women of the least quality show'd all their fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
upon this occasion. A world of Beaux had most nicely
spruc'd up their fine persons with a felonious intention to kill
the Ladies; I mean those empty Fops, that all great Cities
are plagued with, who don't care a farthing whether they
make real Conquests, provided they can but have the reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or scandal of them, chuse you whether: who never at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack
but in a Troop, and always with insolence; and who
by vertue of a handsome Face, Red Stockings, a gilt Snuff-box
and a fine Perriwig, think they can command the lives of all
they meet, and murder all the women with love, and all the
men with fear. Oh what a fine time had the men of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement
that day to shew the fruitfulness of their imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and how much glittering Rhetorick was thrown away
upon Goddesses, who had not been deify'd a full hour? A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the rest, a dapper Younker, who from a School-boy
had advanc'd himself to the dignity of a Page, surpass'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in talking magnificent nonsense before our Heroine, and
never was better pleas'd with his dear person than then. He
had seen her alight out of the Stage-Coach, by the same to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
he was terribly smitten with her; but resolving not to
stop there, he follow'd her to the very door of the House
where she hir'd a Room, and from thence to all the several
places where her curiosity led her. At last our stranger stopt
at a certain place, where she might behold the Masks at her
ease; and our eloquent Page, who had put on his best Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen
that day, and was finer than ordinary, immediately en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
into a conversation with her, and began to display his
talent. She was a woman that understood the world very
well, and lov'd dearly to banter and laugh at your forward
young Prigs, that think they are born with a Patent to be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome.
Judge therefore, if finding our Page an everlasting
Talker, that car'd not what came uppermost, she did not
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oon carry the shallow sot out of his depth, and manage him
as she pleas'd. She intoxicated him with her praises, so that
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oth his heart and soul were at her service. He told her, that
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e waited on an ancient Cavalier of <hi>Andalusia,</hi> Unkle to the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:53808:207"/>
young Gentleman that was to be marry'd, for whom the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
made all this rejoycing; that he was one of the richest men
of his quality, and that he had no other Heir but this young
Nephew, whom he lov'd exceedingly, altho he was one of
the most extravagant young fellows in <hi>Spain,</hi> a lover of all
the women he saw, and besides a little army of Whores and
other Women whom he had inveigled, either by fair
Speeches, or Money; had committed several Rapes, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
respect to age, degree, or condition. He added, that
his follies had been very expensive to his old Unkle; who
was the more desirous to link him in Matrimony, to see whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he wou'd not alter his manners with altering his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.
While the Page discover'd all the affairs and secrets
of his Master, she made him giddy with her flatteries, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending
every word he spoke, and bidding the company ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
with what a grace he told his story; in short, omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
nothing that might help to turn the head of a young
Fop, who had already but too good an opinion of his own
parts.</p>
               <p>The commendations and applauses that come from a fair
mouth are dangerous and deceitful. Our indiscreet Page
had no sooner inform'd <hi>Helen</hi> that he was a Native of <hi>Vallado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid,</hi>
but she began to express herself very much in favour of
that City and its Inhabitants; and after she had put herself
to the expence of some hyperboles in praising them, she as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
our young Coxcomb that of all the fine Gentlemen she
had known of that Country, she never saw one so well
made and accomplish'd as himself. This was the finishing
complement, that pinn'd up the basket. Just as our Page
was going to take his leave of her, she invited him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
her to her Lodgings, and you must not ask the question
why she gave her Lilly-white hand to him rather than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
This unexpected favour made his heart leap within him,
so that he was perfectly out of his little senses; and he conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
within himself that a man ought not to despair of his good
fortune, altho he is never so miserable. When our charming
Flatterer came ito her Room she plac'd the Page in the best
seat: He was so confounded with this treatment, that for
want of taking due care, he came souse with his breech to
the ground: his Cloak fell one way, and his Hat and Gloves
another, and he had like to have run himself through with
his Ponyard, which dropt out of the Scabbard as he fell. <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi>
went to help up our poor Spark, and seem'd to be migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
concern'd at his mischance: She put up his Ponyard,
and told him she cou'd not see him wear it any more that
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:53808:207"/>
day, after the slippery trick it had play'd him. The Page
pick'd up the scatter'd remains of his Shipwrack, and made
several wicked complements suitable to the occasion. All
this while <hi>Helen</hi> made as if she cou'd not recover herself
from her late fright, and began to admire the fine workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of the Ponyard. The Page gave her to understand that
it belong'd to his old Master, who had formerly bestow'd it
upon his graceless Nephew, with a Sword and other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coutrements
belonging to it; and that he had chosen it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
several more, that were in his Master's Wardrobe, on
purpose to make a better figure upon a day of such publick
solemnity. <hi>Helen</hi> made the Page believe she had a mind to
go out in disguise, to see after what manner people of qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
were marry'd at <hi>Toledo.</hi> The Page told her that the
Ceremony wou'd not be perform'd till midnight, and offer'd
her a small Collation in the Chamber of the Master of the
House, who was his friend. He rail'd at his unpropitious
Stars, that he was forc'd to quit the most agreeable company
in the world, to wait upon his Master, who kept his bed by
reason of his illness. He added, that his Gout was the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
why he did not assist at the Wedding, which was to be
kept in a great House in the City, at a good distance from
his own, that was call'd the <hi>Hotel</hi> of the Count <hi>de Fuenso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lide.</hi>
He was pumping his brains to make some pretty com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement
at parting, when he heard some-body knock very
hard at the door. <hi>Helen</hi> seem'd to be strangely discomposed
at it, and desir'd the Page to retire into a little Closet,
where she shut him up longer than he imagined. He that
made such a rapping at the door was <hi>Helen</hi>'s Gallant, half
Pimp and half Bully, whom, to stop the mouths of the
wicked, she was pleased to call Brother. He was the tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
Accomplice of all her wicked actions, and drudge in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
to her private pleasures. She told him how she
had disposed of the Page, and discovered to him her design
to finger some of his old Masters Pistoles, which required
as much speed as dexterity in the execution. The Mules,
tho very well harass'd, were immediately put into the
Coach, that had carry'd them from <hi>Madrid;</hi> and <hi>Helen</hi>
with her company (which was compos'd of the terrible <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tafar,</hi>
the venerable <hi>Mendez,</hi> and a small Lackey) embark'd
in this founder'd Vessel, which carry'd them to a sort of
<hi>Long-lane,</hi> where a parcel of Christian-Jews live, whose
faith is as thread-bare as the second hand Cloaths they sell.
The Masks ran still about the streets; and it so happen'd,
that the Bridegroom, who was mask'd as well as the rest,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:53808:208"/>
met <hi>Helen</hi>'s Coach, and beheld our dangerous stranger, who
seem'd to him to be <hi>Venus</hi> in disguise, or the Sun hurrying
about the streets. He was so strangely tempted at this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witching
sight, that he was within an Ace of leaving his
Bride Elect in the lurch to run after this unknown fair; but
at that time his prudence had power enough to stifle
this growing passion. He follow'd his companions in
the Masks, while the Stage-Coach drove furiously on to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the aforesaid street, where the Brokers liv'd, and here
without much higgling and making of words, <hi>Helen</hi> soon
equipt herself in mourning from top to toe, together with
the ancient <hi>Mendez, Montafar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> and the little Boy. After
this getting into the Coach again, she order'd the fellow to
stop at the <hi>Hotel</hi> of the Count <hi>de Fuensalide.</hi> Our diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Lackey went in first, enquired out the Apartment of
the Marquis <hi>de Villefagnan,</hi> and told him that a Lady from
the Mountains of <hi>Leon</hi> was at the door, who had some busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of great importance to communicate to him. The
good Gentleman was surprized to hear of a visit from such a
Lady, and at such an hour: he raised himself upon his bed
as well as he could, adjusted his wrinkled Cravat, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
two Cushions to be put under his back, to receive so
important a visit with a better Grace. He kept himself in
this posture, with his eye still fixed upon the Chamber
door, when he saw enter the room (not without the great
admiration of his eyes, and as great a palpitation of his
heart) the sorrowful <hi>Montafar,</hi> muffled up in as much
black Crape as would serve half a score Herses, follow'd by
two Women in the same habit, the youngest of whom he
led by the hand, and who covering part of her Face with
her Vail, seem'd to be the most sorrowful and considerable
of the two. A Lackey held up her train, which was so
enormously prolix, that when it was spread out it covered
the whole floor. At the door they saluted the sick old Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
with three profound Reverences, not reckoning that
of the little Lackey, which was worth nothing: In the
middle of the room with three other Reverences all at the
same time, and three more before they took their Seats,
which were brought them by a young page, Comrade to
him whom <hi>Helen</hi> had lock'd up safe in the Closet; but these
three last Reverences were so extraordinary, that they effa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
the remembrance of the former. The Courteous soul
of our old Gentleman was strangely surprized at so odd a
Scene, the Ladies took their Seats, and <hi>Montafar</hi> and the
little Lackey retired bare-headed towards the door. The
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:53808:208"/>
gouty Cavalier was at his wits end to find them comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and he afflicted himself at their mourning, before he
knew the cause of it, which he entreated them to let him
know, as likewise the reason why they did him the honour
of a visit at so unusual an hour for persons of their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<hi>Helen,</hi> who needed not to be informed what a
strange efficacy and perswasion there is in tears that come
from beautiful eyes, immediately pour'd out a torrent of
tears, intermixt with violent sobs and sighs, raising and
falling the tone of her voice as she saw most proper. She
discovered ever and anon her white hands, with which she
wiped her tears, and sometimes shew'd her face, to let him
see she was as beautiful as afflicted. The old Gentleman
expected with impatience when she would open, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
now to hope it, for that impetuous flood of tears,
which had overflowed her charming Field of Lillies and
Roses, was in a manner stopt, when the venerable <hi>Mendez,</hi>
who judged it convenient to re-assume this mournful har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
which the other had finished, began to weep and
sob, and lay about her with that violence, that it was a mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune
and shame to <hi>Helen</hi> that she did not grieve e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough.
The old Matron did not stop here, but resolving
to out-do <hi>Helen,</hi> thought that to tear a handful or two of
her Hair, would not have an ill effect upon the Audience.
It was no sooner thought of, but done: she committed
most horrible ravage upon her Locks, but in truth this
was no mighty loss to her, for there was not one single hair
of the growth of her head. After this manner did <hi>Helen</hi>
and <hi>Mendez</hi> strive who should exceed the other, when <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tafar</hi>
and the Lackey, at a signal concerted between them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
a doleful Consort at the Door, and wept and sigh'd so
cruelly, that one would have thought they designed to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival
the two pensive Ladies near the Bed; who by this
new striking up of the <hi>Chorus,</hi> began to play their parts so
furiously, as if they had been too remiss before. The old
Gentleman was almost distracted, to see them weep so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderately,
yet know nothing of the occasion. He wept
however to keep them company, as well as he could, sobb'd
as strenuously as the best of them, and conjured the afflicted
Ladies by all that was good and sacred, by their seraphical
Eyes, and their celestial Charms to moderate their grief a
little, and acquaint him with the cause of it; protesting,
that his Life was the least thing he would hazard for their
sakes, and regretting the loss of his youth, which hindered
him from shewing the sincerity of his Heart by his Actions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:53808:209"/>
At these words the Sky began to clear up a little, the
Countenances were not so overcast as before, and they
thought that they had wept enough in all conscience, since
they could weep no longer without spoiling the jest.
Besides, they were good Husbands of their time, and
knew that they had not a minute to lose. Our old Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron
therefore lifting up her Vail above her head, to the end
that her venerable looks might give her all the credit she
wanted on this occasion, declaimed in the following man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
<hi>God of his Almighty Power and Goodness preserve and
shield my Lord Marquis</hi> de Ville-fagnan <hi>from all harm, and
restore him to his former health. Altho' to speak truth, the
tragical Story we are going to tell him, is not very proper
to give him joy, which is the Elixir of Health: but O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>
misfortune is of that nature, that we must communicate it,</hi>
At this the poor Marquiss <hi>de Ville-fagnan</hi> striking himself
with the palm of his hand upon his Thigh, and fetching:
sigh from the bottom of his Heart; <hi>Heaven grant,</hi> says he,
<hi>that I am mistaken, but my foreboding mind tells me, that 'tis
some foolish Frolick, or rather some Extravagance of my Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew.
Go on Madam, go on, and excuse me for interrupting
you.</hi> Our old Matron fell a weeping, instead of returning
him an Answer, when the pensive <hi>Helen</hi> took up the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.
Since you know by sorrowful Experience, says she,
that your Nephew is a Slave to his extravagant Appetites
and have been but too often troubled to compound for his
Outrages, you will make no difficulty to believe his brutal
usage of me. When you unhappily sent him to <hi>Leon</hi> la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

Spring, he saw me at Church, and at this first interview
said some things to me, which, had they been true, neither
of us ought to have stirr'd out of that holy ground; my
self, for fear of Justice, as being his Murderer, and he as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

dead Man, and fit to be put in his Grave He told me <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
hundred times that my Eyes had kill'd him, and omitted
none of those insinuating wheedling tricks, that Lovers em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
to abuse the simplicity of poor Virgins. He followed
me home to my Lodging, he rode before my Windows eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
day, and serenaded me every night. At last, finding that
all his amorous arts signified nothing, he corrupted by his
Money a Black Wench, a Slave of ours, to whom my Mother
had promised her liberty, and by her infernal treachery sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd
me in a Garden we have in the Suburbs of the City
I had none but this perfidious Maid with me: he was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
companied by a Man as wicked as himself, and had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
the Gardner to go to the other end of the Town under <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:53808:209"/>
of business. What need I say more; he clapt his Pony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard
to my throat, and finding that my Life was less dear
to me than my Honour, by the help of the Companion of
his crime, he took that by force, which he could never
obtain by fair promises. The Black acted the part of a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted
Woman, and the better to hide her perfidy, she
wounded herself slightly in the hand, and then vanished.
The Gardner return'd: your Nephew affrighted at the black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of his Crime, leapt over the Garden-wall in so much
precipitation, that he dropt his Ponyard, which I took up.
However, this insolent young man had nothing then to
fear; for not being in a condition to stop him, I had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
enough over my self, to dissemble the inexpressible
misfortune that had befallen me. I did all I could to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
no more concern'd than I us'd to be. The wicked
Slave was not to be seen from that moment. Soon after I
lost my Mother, and I might say that I lost every thing
with her, if my Aunt, whom you see there, had not been
so kind as to take me to her own House, where she makes
no difference between her tow beautiful Daughters and my
self. There I came to be inform'd, that your Nephew was
so far from designing to make me reparation for the injury
he had done me, that he was upon the point of marrying
in this City. Upon this I flew hither in the greatest haste I
could, and expect, before I go out of your Chamber, that
you will give me in Money or Jewels, the worth of two
thousand Crowns, to settle me in some Convent; for after
what I have known by fatal experience of the temper of this
Cavalier, I can never bring my self to marry him, altho' he
and his Relations should endeavour to perswade me by all
sorts of Offers and Intreaties. I know well enough that he
is to be married to night, but I'll soon stop all proceedings,
and raise such a hurricane, as shall make his heart ake as
long as he lives, if you don't comply with my proposal:
And to let you see, continued this dissembling Hypocrite,
that what I have told you of your Nephew is so true, that
nothing can be more, see the fatal Ponyard which he clapt to
my throat; and would to God he had done something more,
than only threatned me with it. She began to weep afresh
at the conclusion of the Story. <hi>Mendez</hi> took it in a higher
Key than she, and the harmonious Consort at the Door, of
which the little squeaking Lackey made the Treble, and
<hi>Montafar</hi> the Bass, tuned their Pipes to admiration. Our
old Gentleman, who had already but too easily believed,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

<pb n="64" facs="tcp:53808:210"/>
saw the Ponyard, but he immediately knew it to be the
same he had formerly bestowed upon his Nephew. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all his care was to prevent this Story's taking air, lest
it should hinder the Match.</p>
               <p>He would have sent for him with all his Heart, but he
was afraid lest some people should be so curious as to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
into the occasion; and as 'tis natural for us to fear
where we desire, he no sooner saw our afflicted Ladies rising
from their Seats, and making as if they were going to break
this Marriage to pieces, which he so earnestly desired, and
had taken so much pains to bring about, but he ordered his
Page to bring him his Cabinet, and tell out two thousand
Crowns in four Pistole pieces. <hi>Montafar</hi> received them,
and told them one by one, and the old Marquis having
made them promise him to honour him with a visit next
morning, excused himself a hundred times to the Ladies,
that he was not able to wait upon them to their Chariot.
Away they went very well satisfy'd with their visit, and
ordered the Coachman to drive back to <hi>Madrid,</hi> conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
with themselves, that if they were pursued, it would
be on the Road to <hi>Leon.</hi> In the mean time their Landlady
finding that her Lodgers did not come home, went into
their Chamber, she found the Page in the Closet, who
could not imagin why they shut him up there, and she
let him go about his business, because she knew him, or
rather because upon enquiry she found none of her move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables
missing. Those people that make a Trade of robbing,
and wholly subsist by it, tho they don't fear God, always
fear man. They are of all Countries, and yet are of none,
as having no settled habitation. As soon as they set foot
in one place, they make the most on't they can, and when
they have graz'd it bare, remove to fresh quarters. This
cursed occupation, which is learnt with so much pains and
danger, differs from all others in this respect, that whereas
we leave the rest when we grow old, purely for want of
strength to follow them, that of robbing generally leaves a
man in his youth, and yet 'tis for want of living longer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

One would think that the Gentlemen that follow it, must
find some unaccountable charms in it, since for its sake they
venture a great number of years, which are sooner or later
concluded by the Hangman. <hi>Helen, Mendez</hi> and <hi>Monta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>far,</hi>
had none of these pious reflexions in their head, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

may reasonably conclude, that never did any Leathern Vehi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
make more expedition to <hi>Madrid Montafar</hi> was very
uneasie, and shew'd by the many sighs that escap'd from
him, that he was rather in a penitential than a merry strain.
<hi>Helen,</hi> who had a mind to divert his melancholy, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting
to him the particulars of her life, which till that
moment she had carefully conceal'd from him: Since I find
thou art in such a musty humour, said she to him, I will
satisfie the great longing thou hast always exprest to know
who I am, and what adventures have befaln me before we
came acquainted together. I cou'd tell thee that I am de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended
from a noble family, and according to the vanity
now predominant give my self an illustrious name, as easily
as any of my neighbours; but I will be so sincere with thee,
as to acquaint thee, even with the least faults of those who
sent me into the world. You must know then, that my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
of happy memory, was a <hi>Gallician</hi> by birth, a Lackey
by profession, or to speak more honourably of him, a Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.
He held the memory of the Patriarch <hi>Noah</hi> in singular
veneration, for his noble invention of the Vine; and were
it not for his particular respect to the juice of the Grape, one
might say of him that he car'd but little for the vanities of
this wicked world. My Mother was of <hi>Granada,</hi> to speak
frankly to you, a Slave, but you know there's no contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with our destiny. She answer'd to the name of <hi>Mary,</hi>
which her Masters gave her at her Baptisin; but she was bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
pleas'd to be call'd <hi>Zara,</hi> which was her <hi>Moorish</hi> name:
for since I am to tell you the truth, the whole truth, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but the truth, she was a Christian in complaisance and
fashion; and a Moor in reality. Nevertheless she frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
confess'd, but twas rather the sins of her Master than her
own; and as she amus'd her Confessor not with her own
failings, but with the things she was forc'd to suffer as a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
and shew'd him of what a meek, humble, and patient
spirit she was, the charitable old Father, who was a godly
man, and judg'd of others by himself, believ'd her upon her
word, commended her instead of reproving her, so that any
one that had stood near enough, wou'd have heard nothing
but praises on both sides. Perhaps you are in pain to know
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ow I came acquainted with so particular a secret, and you
may very well imagine that my Mother never disclos'd it to
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e: but I must inform you, that I am very inquisitive in my
nature, and as young as I was at that time, my Mother never
confess'd herself, but I got as near her as I could to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hear
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:53808:211"/>
her confession. But to proceed, as tawny, or to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
my self more properly, as black as she was, her face
and shape were not disagreeable, and there were more than
six Cavaliers, Commanders of red and green Crosses, that
were her humble admirers, and strove who should be most
in her good Graces. She was of so charitable a temper,
that she granted them all they asked of her, and her grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
to her Masters was so great, that to make them some
amends for the pains they had been at in rearing her from
her Childhood, she did all that lay in her power every year
to give them a little Slave, Male or Female: but Heaven
did not second her good intentions, and all her morly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geny,
her chequer'd issue, I mean all the squawling De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi-<hi>Negroes</hi>
of her making, dy'd as soon as they were born.
She was happier in bringing up the Children of other peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
Her Masters that had lost all their own in the Cradle,
got her to nurse a young Child, despair'd of by the Physici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
who in a short time, by her good looking after it, and
the good qualities of my Mothers Milk, was perfectly reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
of its ilness, and shew'd all the symptoms of a long
and healthful life. For this piece of service to her Family, my
Mothers Mistress gave her her liberty when she died. Being
now at her own disposal, she set up for washing and whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tening
of Linnen, and succeeded so well, that in a short
time there was scarce a Beau or Courtier in <hi>Madrid,</hi> that
thought his Linnen well washed unless it pass'd her hands.
And now she began to practice those Lessons again, which
her Mother had formerly given her, I mean to renew her
acquaintance with her correspondents in the other world.
She had laid aside this ticklish employment rather out of
modesty, and because she was tired with the encomiums that
were given her for being so well skill'd in her art, than for
any fear of justice, or apprehensions of the Magistrate. In
short, she applied herself afresh to it, only to oblige her
friends, and in a little time made so great a progress <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
this noble Science, and acquir'd such a credit in the Kingdom
of darkness, that Daemons of the highest reputation were
not thought to be worth a farthing, if they were not in
league with her. I am not vain, neither do I love to tell
lies, added <hi>Helen;</hi> for which reason I will not bestow any
good qualities upon my Mother which she did not possess,
but I am obliged at least to pay this testimony to her vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.
The secrets which she fold, those which she reveal'd
and her Oracles, which made her pointed at in the Streets
were vulgar talents among those of her Nation, in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:53808:211"/>
of what she knew in the Mystery of Maidenheads.
That incomprehensible Flower was much better after she
had lent it a helping hand, than before it was gathered, and
bore a greater price at its second Edition, with my Mother's
Corrections and Amendments, than at the first. She
might be about forty years old, when she married my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the good <hi>Rodrigo.</hi> All the Neighbourhood wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that a man who loved Wine so well, would marry a
woman that never tasted it, as if she still continued a Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and who had her hands always in water,
as being a Landress by profession. But in answer to this,
my Father worthily replied, that love clear'd all difficulties,
and made every thing easie. Some time after, her Belly
swell'd to her chin, and she was happily delivered of me.
But this joy did not last long in our Family. I was about
six years old, when a certain Prince cloathed a hundred
Lackeys in his own Livery against a Bull-feast. My Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was one of the number, drank a large mornings
Draught, and being Pot-valiant, must needs incounter a
wild Bull, who toss'd him two or three story high, and
tore out his Guts. I remember they made Ballads up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
my Fathers death, and the burden of the Song was, <hi>That
two of a Trade can never agree.</hi> I did not understand the
meaning on't then, but I have been informed since, that it
alluded to his being a cornuted Animal like a Bull: but
you know 'tis impossible to stop peoples mouths, if they
have a mind to prate, and vent their ill-natur'd mirth.
My Mother was afflicted at my Fathers misfortune, and so was
I, she was comforted and so was her Daughter. When I was
grown up, my Beauty began to make people talk of me;
and Lord! what pressing and thronging there was to carry
me to the Park, to the Play-house, and to give me Collati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
upon the Banks of the <hi>Mansanares.</hi> My Mother watcht
me like a second <hi>Argos,</hi> so that I grumbled to be so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd;
but she soon made me sensible that it was for my
advantage. Her severity, and the high price she set upon
me, enhanced the value of her Merchandize, and raised a
terrible competition between those that pretended to my
favours. I was as it were put up by way of Auction, each
man thought he had the better of his rival, and each man
fancied he had found that, which was long ago gone and
vanished. A rich <hi>Genoese</hi> Merchant who courted me in
private, so dazzled the eyes of my prudent Mother with
his yellow Metal, and bled so plentifully, that she favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his good intentions. He possess'd the f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

affection, but this superiotity proved very expensive to
him. We continued faithful to him, so long as we believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
he doubted us: when we found him no longer upon his
Guard, we fairly duped him. My Mother was too tender-hearted,
and sensible of the pains of Lovers, not to be
touched with the continual complaints of these Gentlemen,
who were all of them topping Cards at Court, and as rich
as <hi>Croesus.</hi> 'Tis true, they did not throw their Money about
them so plentifully as the <hi>Genoese,</hi> but my Mother, as she
knew how to set a value upon great gains, so she did not
despise the smaller; and besides, she was obliging rather
out of a principle of Charity than Interest. The <hi>Genoese</hi> in
short was declared a Bankrupt, and I don't know but we
might lend a helping hand to his breaking. He was enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
in several scuffles and quarrels for me: The Magistrates
came to visit us more out of civility than for any other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
but my Mother had a natural aversion to the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of the long Robe; and no less hated your Bullies and
Rakehelly Red-coats, that began to besiege us. She there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thought it expedient to remove to <hi>Sevil,</hi> turn'd all her
Plate and Furniture into ready money, and took me with
her in the Stage-Coach. We were betray'd by our villanous
Coach-man, robb'd and stript of all we had, and my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was so bruised and battered, because she defended her
own Goods as long as her little strength would give her
leave, that before I could drag her along with me to a
wretched Inn, she gave up the Ghost at the foot of a Rock.
I armed my self with resolution, altho I was but very young.
I bundled up every rag belonging to the old Gentlewoman,
but our Thieves had been so careful that they left me little
to carry off. Thus I left her to the discretion of the next
passengers, not doubting, but that upon so great Road as it
was between <hi>Madrid</hi> and <hi>Sevil,</hi> some charitable Christians
would come by, and take care to see her Corps interred. I
arrived at <hi>Madrid;</hi> my Lovers were acquainted with my
misfortune, and in a short time I was equipped with new
Rigging and Furniture. About that time I happened to
meet with thee at one of my Female Companions, and I
was perfectly charmed with thy good qualities. What has
happened since I need not relate to thee, since we have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
been asunder. We came to <hi>Toledo;</hi> we left it in haste,
but made so good a Market there, that if thou art a man of
that courage as I take thee to be, thou wou'd'st be merrier
than thou art. But since this long story has made thee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
to take a nap, as I find by thy yawning and nodding,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:53808:212"/>
lay thy head upon my Lap and sleep: But know, that if there
is any thing good or useful in fear, 'tis before we have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
a crime, for 'tis the vilest and most dangerous quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in the world after we have done one. Fear always discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
the minds of the guilty, in such a manner that instead
of flying from those that pursue them, they throw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
frequently into their hands. <hi>Montafar</hi> fell asleep,
and the morning awaked, so beautiful and charming, that
the Birds, the Flowers and the Fountains saluted her each
after its manner; the Birds by singing, the Flowers by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuming
the air, and the Fountains by smiling or murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
no matter which, for one is as true as the other. And
now the Nephew of the Marquis <hi>de Ville-fagnan,</hi> the sensual
<hi>Don Sancho</hi> was getting up from his new Bride, tired e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
in all conscience, and perhaps already glutted with
the pleasures of Matrimony. He could think of nothing
but the pretty stranger, I mean the dangerous <hi>Helen,</hi> whom
he had seen the night before in the Stage-Coach, and fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy'd
to be the Phoenix of her Sex; in which particular he
was guilty of great injustice to his own Lady, who was very
beautiful, and so amiable that several Lovers in <hi>Toledo</hi> sigh'd
for her, while at the same time she sigh'd for her ungrateful
Husband, and that monster of inconstancy sigh'd for an infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
mercenary Strumpet, that wou'd have lick'd the Devil's
cloven foot for half a Crown. But nothing is so irregular as
our appetites. A Husband that has a pretty Wife runs after
a draggle-tail'd nasty Servant-wench. A Noble-man that has
his Ragous and Ortolans, despises what he sees before him,
and calls for the sturdy Beef and Pottage that his Footmen
dine on. All the world has a deprav'd taste in many things,
but your men of Quality more than any. As they have more
wealth than they know what to do with, and fondly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex
themselves in searching after what is never to be found,
they choose course ordinary things, only for variety. Thus
we see they spare neither pains, nor money to purchase
trifles; and sometimes court some common <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ilt a twelve-month
before they can obtain those favours of her, which
she flings away upon others without asking. Heaven per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
this, on purpose that they may punish themselves with
an evil of their own seeking. Wretched man! on whom
Heaven has bestow'd those two things that contribute to
make life happy, Riches in abundance, and a lovely Wife:
Riches to support and relieve those that deserve, but have
them not, and to secure thee from stooping to those mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,
to which poverty often exposes the most generous
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:53808:213"/>
souls; and a Wife that equals thee in quality, beautiful both
in her body and mind, wholly perfect in thy eyes, but much
more so in the eyes of others, who see farther into the
affairs of their neighbour than their own; and, in short,
possess'd of those shining qualifications, Moderation, Chasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Vertue. What is it thou art looking for elsewhere?
hast thou not at home thy other half, thy Wife, whose wit
can divert thee, who yields her body entirely to thy plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
who is jealous of thy Honour, frugal of thy Fortune,
careful to preserve thy Estate, who gives thee Children to
divert thee in their childhood, to support thee in thy old
age, and to keep up thy name after thou art dead. What is
it I say thou art looking for abroad? I will tell thee in a few
words, to ruine thy estate and reputation, to enfeeble thy
body, and lose the esteem of thy friends, and to create thy
self abundance of enemies. Thinkst thou that thy honour is
safe, because thou hast a vertuous Wife? Alas! thou hast
little experience of the things of this world, and art little ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with humane frailty. The most tractable and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et
Horse in the world grows restiff under an ill Horseman
and throws him to the ground. A Woman may now and
then resist a temptation of doing ill, and yet commit a crime
of the last consequence, when she fancies herself most upon
her Guard. One fault draws many after it, and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
between virtue and vice sometimes is not above a day
or two's journey. And now methinks I see some malapert
Critick cock his Hat, toss his Wig over his Shoulders, look
fierce, and ask how these Moral Aphorisms come to be thus
brought in hand over head. Why, pray Sir don't be so
cholerick; make use of them, or let them alone as you see
fit; 'tis all a case to your humble Servant, I'll assure you<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
but under favour, Sir, methinks you ought to thank the
man who gives you them for nothing. But to return to our
story: <hi>Don Sancho</hi> was ready to rise from his young Wife<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
when his Unkle's Steward brought him a Letter, wherein
the old Gentleman sent him word of the strange Lady who
had visited him the night before, and whom he suspected to
have cheated him, because she was not to be found in any
of the Inns in <hi>Toledo,</hi> where he had sent to enquire after her,
and desired him in the same Letter to send him one of his
Servants to pursue this notorious Cheat to <hi>Madrid</hi>
whither he supposed she steered her course, because he had
sent his people upon all the great Roads from <hi>Toledo</hi> to me
neighbouring Cities, and could hear no news of her. <hi>

                     </gap>
Sancho</hi> was not made of Brass, or Marble. He found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:53808:213"/>
attack'd in the weakest part of his Soul, and was won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous
fierce and uppish to be once in his life wrongfully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused
of a fault, who had been found guilty of so many
before. The loss of so great a summ, and the sham that
had been put upon his Unkle equally incensed him. He
told the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> story his Wife and some of his Relations, who
came to give our married pair the good morrow, and being
not to be disswaded from his resolution by the intreaty of
his Wife, or the advice of his Friends, he drest himself in a
minute, eat a little Breakfast, and ran to his Unkle's house.
The Page, who had introduc'd <hi>Helen</hi> into the old Marquis
his Chamber, describ'd the Coach to him, inform'd him
how many they were in company, and by what marks they
might be discover'd. He took post from <hi>Toledo</hi> to <hi>Madrid,</hi>
attended only by two Foot-men, whose courage was not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
to him. He rode four or five stages so fast, that he
had no leisure to think of the Beautiful Stranger; but when
his indignation was a little evaporated by his journey, <hi>Helen</hi>
took place again in his fancy, but so beautiful and charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that he was in the mind once or twice to return to <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledo</hi>
to find her out. He wish'd himself a hundred times at
the Devil, for concerning himself so far about his Unkle's
Robbery; and call'd himself sot and blockhead, and enemy
to his own pleasure as often, to fatigue himself thus in ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Post, whereas he might have employ'd his time to
better purpose, in seeking a happiness, the possession where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
in his opinion, would have made him the happiest man
in the world. While these amorous reflections took up
his thoughts, he often talked to himself, as fools use to do,
and so loud, that his Servants that rode before him stopt
short, and turn'd back to enquire what he wou'd have.
Why, would he often say to himself, did I leave the place
where I first beheld her, and shall not I be the most unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
of all men, if this Stranger leaves <hi>Toledo</hi> before my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn?
Well, 'tis no more than what I deserve, who
must take the office of a Thief-catcher upon me, unask'd
and unsought; but, continu'd he, if I return to <hi>Toledo</hi>
without doing something, what will my Friends say of me,
who wou'd have disswaded me from this enterprize, and
ought I to leave those villains unpunish'd that have robb'd
my Unkle in so unheard of a manner, and besides have so
perfidiously wounded my reputation? These different agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarions
employ'd the mind of our young Extravagant,
when near <hi>Xetaffe</hi> his Foot-man discover'd <hi>Helon</hi>'s Coach by
the marks that had been given them. They cried out with

one voice to their Master, <hi>Yonder are the Thieves,</hi> and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
staying for him, rode up to the Coach with their Swords
in hand. The Coachman stopt, being terribly affrighted,
and <hi>Montafar</hi> was much more than he: <hi>Helen</hi> order'd him
to let down the Glasses, and look'd out to see how she might
prevent so dangerous a storm. She saw <hi>Don Sancho</hi> ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
towards her with Sword in hand, whose angry coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
promised no good; but our amorous Gentleman
no sooner cast his eyes upon those two bewitching Stars,
which had so terribly wounded him, but his wounds bled
afresh, and he immediately believed that his Servants had
mistaken; for we have always a good opinion of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
we love; and as if he had known <hi>Helen</hi> from his Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
to have been a Lady of unblemish'd credit, he lay'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
his Footmen with his Sword like a distracted man.
You Dogs, cry'd he, you Villains, did not I bid you have
a care not to mistake; and don't you deserve to have your
Throats cut for offering this rudeness to a Lady who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
respect from all Mankind? The poor Footmen, who
had fallen so hastily upon the Coach, seeing it had all the
marks the Page had given them, and sound within it a
Lady of so much beauty, which commands veneration
even from the most brutal Clowns, kept off at a distance to
avoid their Masters fury, who thought he had reason on his
side for what he had done, and that he was kind to them
not to cut them to pieces. <hi>Don Sancho</hi> begg'd <hi>Helen</hi>'s par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
and acquainted her with the occasion why those Sons
of a thousand Whores his Footmen had attackt her so rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
which she knew as well as himself. See, I beseech you
Madam, says he, in what premunires these Rascals may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
their Masters; had not I happen'd to be with them,
these Blockheads upon a few foolish marks would have
set the whole Country in an uproar, rais'd the Mob, and
by meer force have carry'd you to <hi>Toledo</hi> for a Thief: Not
but that you are one, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> cries our Gentleman, smoothing
his Countenance, but Madam, you steal hearts and nothing
else. <hi>Helen</hi> thankt Heaven within herself for giving her a
face that stood her in such stead, by clearing her from the
wicked actions she us'd to commit, and recovering out of
her fright, answer'd <hi>Don Sancho</hi> with a great deal of mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
and in few words, knowing that to take a world of pains
to clear ones self of a thing that is laid to ones charge, rather
encreases than lessens the suspicion. <hi>Don Sancho</hi> was sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd
to find that Treasure by meer accident, which he had
so violently long'd to see, and was such a fool as to think that
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:53808:215"/>
Heaven favour'd his passion, since it hinder'd him from go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
back to <hi>Toledo,</hi> as it had been in his thoughts, which had
he done, he had miss'd this happiness. He ask'd <hi>Helen</hi> what
her name was, and where she liv'd in <hi>Madrid,</hi> and begg'd
her to give him leave to wait on her, that he might by his
actions confirm the services he offer'd her. <hi>Helen</hi> told him
both false; adding, that she should think herself very happy
to be honour'd with his visits. He offer'd to see her safe
home, but she wou'd by no means consent to it, represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to him that she was marry'd, and that her Husband was
to meet her on the Road, and whisper'd him in the ear, that
she was afraid even of her Domesticks, but much more of
her Husband's jealous temper. This small confidence she
seem'd to repose in him made <hi>Don Sancho</hi> believe that she
did not hate him. He took his leave of her, and carry'd
swifter by his hopes than by his trusty Steed (if I may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
so to express my self) made the best of his way to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid.</hi>
He no sooner arriv'd there, but he enquir'd after <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,</hi>
and her habitation, by the marks she had given him.
His Foot-men were founder'd in looking after her, nay, he
employ'd all his friends upon this occasion, but to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.
When <hi>Helen, Montafar,</hi> and the venerable <hi>Mendez</hi>
came to <hi>Madrid,</hi> their first care was how to get out of it.
They knew well enough that it wou'd be impossible for them
to escape the <hi>Toledo</hi> Cavalier, and that if they stay'd to give
him a more particular knowledge of their merits, they shou'd
find him as dangerous an enemy, as then they took him to be
their humble admirer. <hi>Helen</hi> dispos'd of all her moveables,
and the next day after her arrival bought Pilgrims habits for
herself and companions. In this equipage they beat the hoof
towards <hi>Burgos,</hi> where <hi>Mendez</hi> was born, and where she
had a Sister of her own profession still living. In the mean
time, <hi>Don Sancho</hi> lost all hopes of meeting with <hi>Helen,</hi> and
return'd to <hi>Toledo,</hi> but so confounded and ashamed, that he
did not speak one word from <hi>Madrid</hi> till he came to his own
house. After he had saluted his Wife, who gave him a
thousand caresses, she shew'd him a Letter from his Brother,
who liv'd in one of the finest Cities in <hi>Spain,</hi> where he had
very good preferment in the Cathedral Church, and was one
of the richest Clergy-men in all the Country, wherein he sent
him word that he was at the point of death. So he stay'd
but a night at <hi>Toledo,</hi> and took post, either to contribute to
his Brother's recovery, or in case he died, to take possession
of his Estate. In the mean time <hi>Helen</hi> pursued her Journey
to <hi>Burgos,</hi> being as much dissatisfied with <hi>Montafar,</hi> as she
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:53808:216"/>
had formerly loved him. He had shewn so little bravery,
when <hi>Don Sancho</hi> and his Footman stopt their Coach, that
she did not question but that he was a rank Coward. This
render'd him so odious to her, that she could scarce endure
his sight, her thoughts were wholly employ'd how to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
herself from this domestick Tyrant, and she flatter'd her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
with hopes that she should soon get out of his clutches.
It was the venerable <hi>Mendez</hi> that first put it into her
head, and fortified this pious resolution, with all the reasons
her prudence cou'd suggest to her. This industrious Matron
was vext to the heart to see a lazy useless Lubber command
her, govern <hi>Helen,</hi> and enjoy all the fruits of their labour,
while he did nothing himself. She incessantly represented
to <hi>Helen</hi> the unhappiness of her condition, which she com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd
to that of Slaves working in the Mines, who enrich
their Masters with the Gold they dig out of the Earth with
incredible labour and hardship, and instead of being the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
treated for it, are commonly rewarded with drubs and
bastinadoes: She continually preach'd to her, that Beauty
was a good of a short duration, and that her Looking-glass,
which shew'd her nothing now but what was amiable, and
never spoke to her but to her advantage, wou'd in a short
time present her with a sight that wou'd not please her, and
tell her most dismal news. Madam, says she to her, a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
that has seen thirty, loses every sixth month one of her
charms, and sees some new blemish or wrinkle rise up every
day in judgment against her face and body. That wicked
thing call'd Time makes young women old, and old wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
wrinkled. If a woman that has enrich'd herself at the
expence of her Chastity and Reputation, yet is for all that
despis'd by the world, notwithstanding her wealth and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
think how wretched and miserable she must needs be,
if she joyns poverty to infamy; and what reason has she to
flatter herself that any one will relieve her in her misery?
If with the Money you have acquir'd by certain means that
are not approv'd by all the world, you shou'd free an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
fellow out of Jayl and marry him, you wou'd do an
action pleasing to God and man, and the end of your life
wou'd make some sort of atonement for the beginning of it:
but you throw away your self and all that you have upon a
Rascal, who is as villainous as he is cowardly, who makes it
his sole ambition to fleece poor women, whom he only gains
by his menaces, and keeps under by his Tyranny; now, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Rose be it spoken, this is to squander away ones
wealth, on purpose to make ones self the greatest wretch
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:53808:216"/>
alive, and to take pains to advance ones ruine. By these
and such like discourses the judicious <hi>Mendez,</hi> who knew
much better how to talk than act, endeavour'd to turn the
Heroic <hi>Montafar</hi> out of the good affections of the vertuous
<hi>Helen,</hi> who had no other reason almost for loving him, but
because she had been so long us'd to his company, and who
was a woman of too good sense not to approve those reasons
in her own thoughts, that the old Matron laid before her.
In short, they were not urg'd to no purpose. <hi>Helen</hi> receiv'd
them in good part, and so much the more readily, as <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dez</hi>'s
interest alone was not concern'd in them; and because
at that time <hi>Montafar</hi> was coming up to them, that they
might enter <hi>Guadarrama</hi> in a body, the place where they
intended to dine, they adjourn'd to a more convenient op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity,
their thinking of ways and means how to
give him the slip, and get rid of him. He seem'd to

day and all night, and increasing upon him next morning,
gave <hi>Helen</hi> and <hi>Mendez</hi> some hopes that this lucky Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

frankly with thee (for this is not a time to dissemble) both of
us began to be so weary of thy Tyranny, that our parting

thee with this sickness, which will soon do thy business

no more thought of thee than if thou hadst never had a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
In short, whatever foolish desire thou mayst have to
live, thou oughtst to be very well pleas'd with thy death,
since Heaven, for reasons unknown to men, gives thee a
more honourable end than thou dost deserve, permitting a
Fever to do that for thee, which either the Hang-man does
for such Villains, or fear for such mean-spirited Rascals as
thou art. But my dear <hi>Montafar,</hi> before we part for good
and all, tell me sincerely once in thy life, Didst thou ever
think I was such an errant fool as to stay here to watch
thee a nights, to give thee thy Juleps, thy Potions,
thy Cordials, and administer thy Clysters. Don't suffer
such vanities as these to come into thy noddle so near death,
Tho it concern'd not only thy health, but that of thy whole
family, I wou'd not stay here a quarter of an hour longer.
Cause thy self to be carry'd to some Hospital, and since thou
hast always follow'd my advice, don't despise this, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

of a Fever, is enough to kill thee in twenty four hours.

sufferers, and turning himself towards <hi>Helen,</hi> he spoke to
her as follows. My dear <hi>Helen,</hi> take not in ill part what I
have done, but consider my good Intention, and know
that every one is bound in conscience to follow his own Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation:
Tis thine to be malicious; for alas, the World is
compos'd of bad as well good, and 'tis mine to punish the
malicious. Whether I have acquitted my self as I ought,
thou knowest better than any one; and if I have heartily
chastis'd thee, be satisfi'd that I as heartily love thee. If
my duty did not render me deaf to all pity, I would not

Having raillied them in this fashion, good or bad, as the
Reader pleases, away he went, and left them rather dead
than alive, not so much for the grief of their having been
whipt, as because all their Money was gone, and they were
left in a lonely place ty'd to Trees, where they must ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect

But <hi>Helen</hi>'s Face having lost nothing of its former
Beauty, altho somewhat disorder'd by her fright, made him
conclude, that he at last had accidentally met with that trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
which had cost him so many desires and inquietudes.
So he rais'd himself upon his Stirrups to see whether the
Coast was clear, and was fool enough to suspect that this
was nothing but a Diabolical Illusion, which Heaven had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to punish him for his sensuality. <hi>Helen</hi> on her side
was taken up with a thought full as mortifying, and fancied
that her ill Stars had chosen that unlucky day, to show her to
all those that had any thing to say to her. <hi>Don Sancho</hi> look'd
upon <hi>Helen</hi> with great amazement, and she look'd upon him
with no less disorder; each expected when the other would
speak first, and <hi>Don Sancho</hi> at last was going to begin the
discourse, when a Servant came full speed to tell him, that
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ome of his Relations were going to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ill one another. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this he spurr'd his Beast, attended by the Servant; and
when he came to the place where a left his Company, he
found some four or five drunken Fellows, calling one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Rogue and Rascal, with their Tilters in their Hands, and
flourishing them notably in the air, to the prejudice of some
Neighbouring Trees, that lost some of their best branches
upon this occasion. <hi>Don Sancho,</hi> who was enrag'd to be
depriv'd of the charming Vision he had so lately seen, did
all he could to reconcile these furious and terrible Gentlemen;
but all his Arguments, his Entreaties and his Menaces had
signify'd little or nothing, had not the Wine that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>oaded
their Brains, and down right lassitude tript up their
Heels, and left 'em snoring on the ground, as peaceably as
if they had never fallen out. <hi>Don Sancho</hi> spurr'd his Horse
towards the happy Tree, which kept the Idol of his heart,
and was at his wits ends, when he saw the Women were
gone: He turn'd his eyes all about him, to see which way
they could be gone, but saw nothing but a lonely melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
place; he spurr'd his Horse and examin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d every
cornere, and at last came back to his beloved Tree,
which like a good natur'd Tree as it was, still kept its old
place. But as <hi>Don Sancho</hi> was a Poet, and what is more, a
tender-hearted whining Poet, he had not the same indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
for this insensible Tree. He alighted therefore from
his Horse, and harangu'd it after the following manner, or
at least he ought to have done so, if he was really so great a
Coxcomb, as I have been told he was. Oh thrice happy
Trunk! since thou hast had the honour to be embrac'd by
that divine Creature, whom I love without knowing her,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:53808:220"/>
and whom I know only because I love her. May thy Leaves
for ever shine among the Stars; let the sacrilegious Ax ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
presume to wound thy tender Bark; may the Thunder
reverence thy Boughs, and the worms of the Earth not dare
to approach thy root; let the Winter spare, and the Spring
adorn thee; let the proudest Pines envy thy condition, and
lastly, may Heaven protect thee. While our worthy Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
spent himself in these vain contemplations, or if you
please, in these Poetical follies, which, by the by, are of
greater importance than any other, and ought not to be us'd
every day in the week, his Servants, who knew not what
was become of him, after they had look'd for him a pretty
while, at last found him and brought him home. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
to his Brother's House very much concern'd at his
late adventure; and unless I am mistaken, I have heard
some people say, that he went supperless to bed. Some Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
perhaps will tell me, that I have left my Reader too
long in suspence, who without question is impatient to
know by what strange Inchantment <hi>Helen</hi> and <hi>Mendez</hi> came
to disappear to the amorous <hi>Don Sancho.</hi> But let him have
patience, and I will soon inform him. <hi>Montafar</hi> was at first
pleas'd with that piece of justice he had done upon the two
Fugitives; but no sooner did the heat of his revenge begin
to cool, but love inflam'd him, and represented <hi>Helen</hi> to his
thoughts, infinitely more charming than he had ever seen
her. He consider'd with himself, that the prize he had
taken from her would be soon spent, whereas her Beauty
was a certain revenue to him, so long as he kept well with
her, whose absence was already become insupportable to him.
So he came back the same way he went, and with those in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual
barbarous hands, that had so rigorously bound the
two Dames to the Trees, and afterwards had so unmerciful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
lash'd them, he broke their Chains, that is to say, he
either cut or unty'd their Cords, (for Historians differ) and
set them at liberty, at the same time when <hi>Don Sancho</hi> was
employ'd not far off, to reconcile his drunken Companions,
that were in a fair way to cut one anothers throats. <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tafar,
Helen</hi> and <hi>Mendez</hi> shook hands upon the road, and
after they had mutually promis'd to forget all that was pas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>,
embrac'd with as much tenderness, as if nothing had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd;
doing just as your'great persons do, who neither hate
nor love, but accommodate these two contrary Passions to
their Interest, and the present state of their affairs, They
deliberated which way to take, and 'twas agreed, <hi>Nemin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
Contradicente,</hi> that it was by no means adviseable for them
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:53808:220"/>
to go to <hi>Burgos,</hi> where they would be in danger of having
their quarters beaten up by the <hi>Toledo</hi> Cavalier. Therefore
they pitch'd upon <hi>Sevil</hi> to be the place of their retreat,
and Fortune seem'd to approve their design; for coming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the <hi>Madrid</hi> road, they met a Muleteer with three empty
Mules, who agreed to carry them to <hi>Sevil,</hi> at the very first
proposal that <hi>Montafar</hi> made him. He took care to regale
our Damsels upon the road, to make them forget the ill
treatment they had receiv'd from his hands. At first they
could hardly bring themselves to trust him, and had resolv'd
to be reveng'd on him the first opportunity that presented it
self; but at last, rather for reasons of State, than any
principle of charity, they became better Friends than ever.
They consider'd that discord had ruin'd the greatest Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires,
and believ'd that they were in all probability born
for one another. They did not think fit to give any speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of their Profession upon the road to <hi>Sevil;</hi> for as their
design in shifting their Country, was only to get at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
from those that might pursue them, they were afraid
of bringing themselves into new trouble, which might hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
them from going to <hi>Sevil,</hi> where they had great designs
to put in execution. They alighted within a league of the
City, and having satisfy'd the Muleteer, got thither about
the dusk of the Evening, and took up their Lodging at the
first Inn they found. <hi>Montafar</hi> hired a House, furnish'd it
with very ordinary Furniture, and dress'd himself all in
black, with a Cassock, and a long Cloak of the same colour.
<hi>Helen</hi> took the Habit of a Religious Sister, that had devoted
herself to works of Piety. <hi>Mendez</hi> went dress'd like a Saint,
valuing herself upon her hoary locks, and a huge monstrous
Chaplet, each Bead of which was big enough to load a
Demi-culverin. The very next day after their arrival, <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tafar</hi>
shew'd himself in the Streets, apparell'd as I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
describ'd him, marching with his Arms across, and
looking on the ground when he met any Women. He cry'd
out with a shrill voice that was enough to have rent a Rock,
blessed be the holy Sacrament of the Altar, and the thrice
happy Conception of the Immaculate Virgin, and utter'd
many more devout Exclamations, with the same everlasting
Lungs of leather. He made the Children whom he met in
the street repeat the same words, and assembl'd them some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
together, to teach them to sing Hymns and Songs of
Devotion, and instruct them in their Catechism. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair'd
to the Goals, and preach'd before the Prisoners, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting
some, and relieving others, begging Victuals and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:53808:221"/>
Provisions for them, and frequently walking to the
Prison with a heavy Basket upon his back. O detestable
Villain! thou wanted'st nothing but to set up for a Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite,
to be the most profligate accomplish'd Rascal in the
Universe. These actions of Virtue, in a fellow that was the
least virtuous of all Mankind, gave him in a little time the
reputation of a Saint. <hi>Helen</hi> and <hi>Mendez</hi> likewise did all that
in them lay to deserve Cononization. The one call'd herself
the Mother, the other the Sister of the thrice blessed Friar
<hi>Martin.</hi> They went every day to the Hospitals, and there
they assisted the sick, made their Beds, wash'd their Linnen,
and did all this at their own expence. By these means the
most vicious people of all <hi>Spain</hi> obtain'd the universal ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration
of all <hi>Sevil.</hi> About this time, a Gentleman of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid</hi>
happen'd to come thither about some private Affairs.
He had formerly been one of <hi>Helen</hi>'s Lovers, for women of
her character have more than one string to their bow: He
knew <hi>Mendez</hi> to be a notorious Cheat, and <hi>Montafar</hi> to be
no better. One day as they came out of the Church toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
encompass'd by a great number of persons, who kiss'd
their very garments, and conjur'd them to remember them
in their prayers, they were known by the aforesaid Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
who burning with a Christian zeal, and not able to
suffer three such notorious Impostors to abuse the credulity
of a whole City, broke through the Crowd, and giving a
hearty box on the ear to <hi>Montafar,</hi> You wicked Cheats,
cry'd he to them, do you neither fear God nor man? He
wou'd have said more, but his good intention, which in truth
was somewhat of the rashest, had not the success it deserv'd.
All the people fell upon him, whom they believ'd to have
committed Sacriledge, in offering this violence to their
Saint. He was beaten down to the ground, and had cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
been torn to pieces by the Mob, if <hi>Montafar</hi> by a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
presence of mind had not undertaken his protection;
covering him with his body, keeping off those that were
most enrag'd against him, and exposing himself even to
th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap> blows. My Brethren, cry'd he to them as loud as he
was able, let the poor wretch alone for the love of God; be
quiet for the love of the Blessed Virgin. These few words
appeas'd this horrible tempest, and the people made room
for Brother <hi>Martin,</hi> who got up to the unfortunate Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
well pleas'd in his heart to see him so us'd, but shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by his looks that he was mightily concern'd for him.
He rais'd him up from the ground, he embrac'd and kiss'd
him all cover'd with blood and dirt as he was, and repri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:53808:221"/>
the people for their rude behaviour. I am a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
man, said he to the standers by, I am a sinner, I am one
that never did any thing that was pleasing in the eyes of
God. Do you believe, continu<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d he, because you see me
drest in this Religious garb, that I have not been a Robber
all my life, the scandal of others, and the destruction of
my self? Alas you are mistaken, my Brethren: make me
the mark of your contumelies, pelt me with Stones, and
draw your Swords upon me. Having spoken these words
with a counterfeit sorrow, he went to throw himself with a
zeal yet more counterfeit than that, at the feet of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
and kissing them, not only begg'd his pardon, but
likewise gather'd up his Sword, Cloak and Hat, which he had
lost in this confusion. He helpt him on with them, and leading
him by the hand to the end of the Street, took his leave of
him, after he had bestow'd abundance of embraces, and as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
benedictions upon him. The poor man was as it were
out of himself with what he had seen, and with what had
been done to him, and was so full of confusion, that he durst
scarce shew his head in the Streets all the while his affairs
detain'd him at <hi>Sevil. Montafar</hi> had won the hearts of all
the City by this pretended action of Devotion. The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
gaz'd at him with admiration, and the Children cry'd
after him, a Saint, a Saint, as they cry'd out a Fox, a Fox,
when they saw his Enemy in the Street. From this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
he liv'd the happiest life in the world: The Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
the Cavalier, the Magistrate, and the Prelate perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
invited him to Dinner, and strove who should
have most of his company. If he was ask'd his name, he
would answer, that he was a beast of Burden, a sink of
Filth, a vessel of all Iniquity, and such like noble Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes
did his counterfeit devotion dictate to him.
When he visited any of the Ladies, he complain'd to them
incessantly of the nothingness of his dispensation, and the
deadness of the inward man; adding, that he wanted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centration
of heart, and recollection of Spirit; in short, he
always talkt to them in this magnificent cant, and holy
Gibberish. No alms were given in <hi>Sevil</hi> but what pass'd
through his hands, or those of <hi>Helen</hi> and <hi>Mendez,</hi> who
were not wanting on their side, to act their parts to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
and stood as fair to obtain the red-letter'd prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Almanack, I mean to be Sainted, as <hi>Montafar</hi>
himself. A Lady of quality who was a Widow, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout
even to superstition, sent 'em every day two dishes
of Meat for their Dinner, and as many for Supper, and these
dishes were drest by the best Cook in all <hi>Sevil.</hi> Their
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:53808:222"/>
house was too little to receive the numerous presents that
were sent to them: A woman that had a mind to be with
child put her petition into their hands, that by their media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
it might be presented to the Tribunal of Heaven: Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that had a Son in the <hi>Indies</hi> did the same, as likewise a
third that had a brother prisoner in <hi>Algiers.</hi> Nay, the poor
Widow who had to contest with a powerful adversary before
an ignorant or a covetous Judge, did not doubt the success
of her cause, when she had once made a present to them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to her ability. Some gave them Sweetmeats and
Conserves, others Pictures and ornaments for their Closet.
Several charitable persons trusted them with great quantities
of Linnen and Woollen Cloath, to dispose among the needy
that were asham'd to beg, and with considerable summs of
Money to distribute as they saw convenient. No one came
to visit them with empty hands, and their future Canonizati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was as firmly believ'd as an Article of Faith. At last, the
the credulity of the people ran so high, that they came to
consult them about their doubtful affairs, and things to
come. <hi>Helen,</hi> who was as subtle as a Devil, manag'd all
the answers, delivering her Oracles in a few words, and those
capable of receiving different interpretations. Their beds
were mean and homely, cover'd in the day time with course
Blankets, but at night with all the fine Furniture that a
man could desire, that loves to sleep deliciously; their
house being plentifully furnish'd with good Feather-beds, fine
Coverlids, and in short, with all sorts of Moveables that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
to the convenience and pleasure of life: and all this
they pretended was to be given to some poor Widow,
whose Goods were seized in Execution, or to furnish some
young Womans house, who had marry'd without any for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.
Their doors were shut up in Winter at five, and in
Summer at seven a clock, as punctually as in a well-regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
Convent; and then the Jack was wound up, the Spits
turn'd merrily round, the Capons were set down to the Fire,
the Table was handsomely spread, and our Hypocritical Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umvirate
eat heartily, and drank plentifully their own
healths, and those of the people they cheated. <hi>Montafar</hi> and
<hi>Helen</hi> lay together for fear of Spirits, and their Foot-man
and the Maid, that were of the same complexion, copy'd so
pious an example. As for the good <hi>Mendez,</hi> she always lay
alone, being more taken up with contemplation than action,
even since she had addicted herself to the Black Art. This
was their constant practice of life, instead of employing
their time in mental prayer, or doing pennance. 'Tis
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:53808:222"/>
no wonder if living so jolly a life, they look'd plump and
fat. All the City bless'd Heaven for it, and were mightily
surpriz'd that persons of so much austerity and self-denial
look'd better than those that liv'd in luxury and ease. For
the space of three years they deceiv'd the eyes of all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
of <hi>Sevil,</hi> receiving presents from every one; and
appropriating to their own use the alms that pass'd through
their hands, they heap'd together an incredible number of
Pistoles. All good success was ascrib'd to the efficacy of
their prayers; they stood God-fathers for all Children, made
matches for all the City, and were the Arbitrators of all dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences.
At last Heaven was weary of conniving longer at
their impious life. <hi>Montafar,</hi> who was choleric in his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
us'd frequently to beat his Valet, who cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d not bear
it, and had quitted his service a hundred times, if <hi>Helen,</hi>
who was more discreet than her Gallant, had not prevented
it, by appeasing him with fair words and presents. One
day he drubb'd him immoderately for little or no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
the Boy got to the door, and blinded by his passion,
ran directly to the Magistrates, to inform against these three
Hypocrites, whom the world took for Saints. <hi>Helen</hi>'s dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical
Spirit misgave her what would happen, so she ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised
<hi>Montafar</hi> to rub off with all the Gold they had in the
house, and retire to some place of security, till this Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest,
which threatned them, had spent itself. It was no
sooner said but put in execution: They carry'd off the most
valuable things they had, and walking down the Street as
unconcern'd as if they dreaded nothing, they went out at
one gate, and came in at another, on purpose to lose the
scent of their Pursuers. <hi>Montafar</hi> had insinuated himself into
the good graces of a Widow, as vicious and as rank a Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite
as himself. He had communicated this secret to <hi>Helen,</hi>
who was no more jealous of this Matron, than <hi>Montafar</hi>
would have been of a Gallant, that would have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted
the good of their little Commonwealth. Here
they absconded in safety, and lived luxuriously, the Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
loving <hi>Montafar</hi> for his own sake, and <hi>Helen</hi> for <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tafar</hi>'s.
In the mean time the Justice was conducted by the
vindicative Valet to the fam'd Mansion of our pretended
Saints. When he came there he found the Birds were
flown, and the Maid was not able to inform him whither
they were gone: However, he sealed up all their Trunks,
and took an exact Inventory of all that was in the House.
The Serjeants found more Provision in the Kitchen, than
would serve to regale them one day, and you may be sure
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:53808:223"/>
took care to lose nothing of what they might privately sink
to their own use without being observed. In the midst of
this bustle the venerable <hi>Mendez</hi> entred the House, little
imagining what had happen'd. The Serjeants apprehended
her, and carried her to prison with a vast concourse of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
at her heels. The Servant and Maid were likewise sent
thither to bear her company, and having talked too much,
as well as the old Matron, they were condemn'd as well as
she, to receive two hundred lashes on the back. <hi>Mendez</hi>
died three days after this Chastisement, it being somewhat
of the severest for a person of her age, and the Servant and
Maid were banish<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Helen</hi> preserv'd her dearly beloved <hi>Montafar,</hi> and herself
from the hands of the Magistrates, who sear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

were all asham'd to be so notoriously cheated, and the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lad-singers

Saints in lamentable Doggerel. These Insects of <hi>Parnassus</hi>

and the wretched Rhymes they compos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Cheats, who, not long before were the Idols of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,

after <hi>Don Sancho de Villefagnan,</hi> and finding that he was not
in <hi>Madrid,</hi> they appear'd in Publick; he drest as fine as a
Lord, and she in the Equipage of a woman of quality, and
as beautiful as an Angel. She was marry'd to <hi>Montafar,</hi> as
has been said above, but it was upon this condition, that like a
Husband of good sense and great patience, he should not take

Promoters of a good intelligence, between the two
Sexes, vulgarly call'd Bawds, or to speak more honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
of them women of intrigue, soon came acquainted with
<hi>Helen,</hi> and directed her how to manage herself. One day
they made her shew herself at the Play-house, the next day
in the Park, and sometimes in the high Street of <hi>Madrid</hi> in
her Coach, where bestowing a glance upon one, a smile up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

obliging behaviour, and led them as it were by the hand
to her Apartment, where he was so courteous and discreet,
that he always pretended some extraordinary business or
other call'd him out, in order to leave them by themselves.
He scorn'd the acquaintance of any that were not, rich and
wou'd not spend their money freely, and never knock'd at the
door till he was assur'd by a certain Signal that always hung
out of his window, when his virtuous Spouse was taken up
in private business, that his presence wou'd spoil no sport;
and if the aforesaid Signal forbid his coming in, he trooped
off merry and well satisfy'd, as knowing business went on
in his absence, and pass'd away an hour or so at some
gaming Academy, where every one caress'd him for his
Wife's sake. Among the rest that paid Tribute to <hi>Helen,</hi>
a certain Gentleman of <hi>Granada</hi> surpass'd all his Compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titors
in his excess of love and his expences. He was des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended
of so good a Family, that the Titles of his Nobility
were to be found in the Archives of the Capital City of
<hi>Iudea,</hi> and those that were particularly acquainted with
his pedigree, have affirm'd, that his Ancestors were the
Hang-men of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> both before and after <hi>Caiphas.</hi> His

<pb n="90" facs="tcp:53808:224"/>
they insult at discretion, who go every day to the Play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house,
to pick Pockets, or make quarrels there, and at
night draw their Swords and hack them against some pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
wall, swearing next morning that they were engag'd in
a dangerous rencounter the night before with at least half a
dozen Bullies at once. The sage <hi>Montafar</hi> often told <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,</hi>
that he was not pleas'd to see such a visitant in his house,
from whom they cou'd expect nothing; but for all he
cou'd say to her, she was not in the mind to part with her
Gallant. <hi>Montafar</hi> was angry with her, and to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
some amends out of her Carcass, treated her with the
same chastisement, which <hi>Mendez</hi> of happy memory and
she had formerly suffer'd in the Mountains of <hi>Burgos. He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi>
pretended to be easily reconcil'd to him, but meditated
revenge in her heart. The better to accomplish her design,
she caress'd him so lovingly for eight days together, that
<hi>Montafar</hi> perswaded himself she was one of those tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctable
women that adore their Tyrants, and use their hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Servants scurvily. One day that our <hi>Granada</hi> Gallant
had promis'd to sup with them, but by reason of some un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected
business, could not come to the noble entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
he had provided for them, <hi>Montafar</hi> and <hi>Helen</hi> drank
hand to fist several Bumpers to their Benefactor, to whom
they were oblig'd for all this good chear. <hi>Montafar</hi> got
fuddled according to his laudable custom, and towards the
end of the repast, must needs taste a Bottle of perfum'd
Hipocrass, which the Gentleman had sent them as an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
present. It is not certainly known whether
<hi>Helen,</hi> who opened the Bottle before Supper, put
any poisonous Drugs into it: but this is agreed on all hands,
that soon after <hi>Montafar</hi> had empty'd it, he felt a strange
heat in his Bowels, and intolerable pains after that. He
suspected that he was poison'd, and ran towards his Sword,
at the same time that <hi>Helen</hi> ran towards the door, to avoid
his fury. <hi>Montafar</hi> went in to his Chamber, thinking she
had hid herself there, and lifting up the Tapestry, he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd
<hi>Helen</hi>'s young Gallant, who without any more ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony

throat. The Servants made such a hellish noise with crying
out <hi>Murder,</hi> that the Justice coming that way ran into the
house, just as the young Bravo, who had done <hi>Montafar</hi>'s
business for him, was making his escape. In the mean time
<hi>Helen,</hi> who had got into the Street, and knew not which
way to take, ran into the first house she found open. She
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:53808:224"/>
saw a light in a lower room, and a Cavalier walking up
and down in it. Without asking him any questions, she
threw herself at his Feet to implore his assistance and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection,
and was strangely surpriz'd to find it was <hi>Don San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho
de Villefagnan,</hi> who on his part was no less astonish'd to
see the Idol of his heart, this being the fourth time of his
meeting with her by accident. <hi>Don Sancho</hi> had lately fallen
out with his Wife, who had procur'd herself to be divorc'd
from him upon the score of his ill usage of her, and his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly
life. He had obtain'd a Commission at Court to go
and settle a new Colony in the <hi>Indies,</hi> and was to embark at
<hi>Sevil</hi> in a short time. While <hi>Helen</hi> told him a thousand lies,
and he was ravish'd to find she was ready to follow him into
<hi>America:</hi> the Justice apprehended the Assassin of <hi>Montafar,</hi>
and made a strict search after <hi>Helen</hi> in <hi>Madrid,</hi> and seiz'd
all that he could find in her house. <hi>Don Sancho</hi> and <hi>Helen</hi>

him a hundred Rogues for his pains, <hi>Don Garcias</hi> conducted,

to me than ever. In short, nothing pleas'd me but <hi>Andra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da.</hi>
I lov'd none but him, and in all places where I did not
see him, I surpriz'd all the Company with my distractions,
and restless behaviour. <hi>Andrada</hi> on his side lov'd me full
as passionately. His Predominant passion for Play gave
way to his love: his Presents gain'd my women; his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
and his Verses charm'd me, and his Serenades set all the
Husbands in our Street a thinking for whom they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd.
In short, he attackt me so well, or I defended
my self so ill, that I surrendred. I promis'd him all that
it lay in my power to give him, so that now we had no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
difficulty to surmount, but that of a convenient time
and place. My Husband had engag'd in a hunting match,
which would keep him several days in the Country.
I sent to acquaint my dear <hi>Portuguese</hi> with this news, and
we agreed to execute our amorous designs that very night,
after my Husband was gone out of Town. I was to leave
at a certain hour the back-door of our Garden open, and
under pretence of passing part of the night there, by reason
of the excessive heats, I was to set up a Field-bed in a little
Summer-house, that was open on all sides, and encompass'd
with Orange trees and Jessamines. At last my Husband
quitted <hi>Valladolid,</hi> and that day seem'd to me the longest I
ever knew. The night came, and my women having set
me up a Bed in the Garden, I pretended to be very sleepy,
and as soon as my Maids had undress'd me. I commanded
them all to go to bed, except one Chamber-maid, who
knew the secret of my Amour: I had scarce laid me down,
and the Maid, whose name was <hi>Marina,</hi> had scarce shut
the Garden-door that fac'd the house, and open'd the back
door, when my women came to tell me that my Husband
was coming. I had but just time enough to shut the
Garden door, which I had order'd to be left open for <hi>Andra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da.</hi>
My Husband caress'd me as he us'd to do, and you may
may imagine how I receiv'd him. He told me that he was
forc'd to come back, because the Gentleman, who had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited
him to the sport, had unluckily fallen from his
Horse, and broken his Leg. After this he commended my
Judgment for choosing so cool and refreshing a place,
and concluded that he would take up his quarters there.
He got himself undrest at the same time, and came to bed
to me. I did all I could to conceal my vexation for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
and to shew him by my feign'd embraces that his
were not ungrateful to me. In the mean time <hi>Andra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>a</hi>
came at the hour of assignation, and finding the door
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:53808:228"/>
shut, which he thought to have found open, by the help of
his Valet he leapt over the Garden-wall, where he had hop'd
to pass the night with me. He has confess'd to me since,
that his jealousie put him upon so hardy and dangerous a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign;
that he did not doubt but that some happy and better
belov'd Rival enjoy'd that happiness, which I had promis'd
him. These suspicions of his, that perhaps I diverted my
self at his expence with another Gallant, so inflam'd his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
that he was resolv'd to use me ill, in case he found what
he suspected to be true, and to revenge himself upon his Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val
to the last extremity. He crept up to the Summer-house,
where we lay together, as softly as he cou'd. The Moon
shone very bright, I saw him, and knew him as soon as he
came in: he saw that I was very much affrighted, and made
a sign to him to be gone. At first he cou'd not discern, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the person, that was in bed with me, was my Husband
or some one else; but observing in my countenance less fear
than confusion and shame, and seeing upon the Table the
Cloaths and Plume of Feathers, which he had seen my Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
wear that very day, and which were as singular as they
were remakable, he saw satisfied that it was <hi>Don Sancho,</hi>
whom he saw a bed with me, and found him to be faster
asleep than a Gallant in all probability would have been.
However, he drew near that part of the Bed where I lay,
and stole a kiss from me, which I could not well hinder,
considering the fear I was in, lest my Husband should a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake.
He had no mind to keep me longer in this fright,
but went away, lifting up his eyes to heaven, shrugging
his Shoulders, and shewing all the marks of a man that was
deeply afflicted at this disappointment, and leapt back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
over the Garden-Wall, with the same facility as before.
Early in the morning I received the most passionate Letter
from him that I ever read, accompany'd with a pretty Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
of Verses upon the Tyranny of Husbands. He spent the
remainder of the night, after he had parted with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
writing them, and next day when I receiv'd them, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
could hardly do any thing else but read them over and over<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

as oft as I could do it in private. Neither of us sufficient<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
reflected upon the hazard we had run, to make it a want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to us not to expose our selves so any more. But altho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
had not been inclin'd of my self to grant him all that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
asked of me, or had loved <hi>Andrada</hi> less than I did, or had
not yielded to the insinuating flattery of his Letters, yet
could not have resisted the perswasion of my Chamber-maid
who talkt to me incessantly in his favour. She repreach'<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:53808:228"/>
me with want of resolution, which had made me think no
more of <hi>Andrada,</hi> and talk'd of the passion he had for me
with the same vehemence, as she could have told a Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heart
of her own, what a kindness she had for him. By
this I found that she was not to learn her Trade now, and
likewise saw of what importance it is to be careful in the
choice of those persons, that are plac'd about those of my
age and condition. But I was resolv'd to ruin my self, so that
if she had been more vertuous than she was, she had enjoy'd
a less share in my confidence. At last she over-perswaded
me to receive <hi>Andrada</hi> in a Dressing-room near my Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
where she lay by herself; and we agreed that so soon as
my Husband was fast asleep, she should lye by him in my
place, while I pass'd the night with <hi>Andrada.</hi> Thus we got
him conceal'd into my Dressing-room; my Husband fell
asleep, and I prepar'd to meet my Lover with all the emoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of one whose desires are violent, yet who has a great
deal to fear, when a terrible noise of confus'd voices that
cry'd out <hi>Fire, Fire,</hi> alarm'd my ears, and wak'd my Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band:
At the same time my Chamber was all in a smoke,
and I cou'd perceive the flames through my Windows. A
Negro Maid, that serv'd in the Kitchen, had set it on fire being
drunk, and it was not perceiv'd till it had taken hold of
some dry Wood, and the neighbouring Stables, and now
had seiz'd the boards of my apartment: My Husband was
very well belov'd: In an instant the house was full of neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
that came to help us to quench the fire. My Brother-in-law
<hi>Don Lewis,</hi> whom the common danger had made
more active and diligent than the rest, was one of the first
that helpt us with his Servants, and push'd on by his passion,
made his way into my Chamber through the flames, that
had already seiz'd the Stair-case. He was in his shirt, and
had nothing over it but his Night-Gown, in which he wrapt
me up, and taking me between his arms, who might
more properly be said to be dead than alive, for the
danger to which <hi>Andrada</hi> was expos'd, rather than for
my own; he carry'd me to his own room, through
the communication his house had with ours, and
setting me down upon his bed, left me there, accompany'd
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

all that had concern'd themselves in this accident, that had
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> us, bestirr'd themselves so notably, that the fire was
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ut out, after it had done a great deal of damage. <hi>Andrada</hi>
made his escape without difficulty among the crowd and
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> of people that came to help us; and you may imagine
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:53808:229"/>
how joyful I was when <hi>Marina</hi> told me the agreeable news.
He writ to me a hundred foolish things the next day, which
I answer'd with more transport than he had shewn; and thus
we made a shift by writing to one another to soften and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that pain, which absence gave us. After we had repair'd
all the mischief that the fire had done us, and I had left <hi>Don
Lewis's</hi> room to return to my own, <hi>Andrada</hi> easily perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
me to let him try the same way once more, which had
not fail'd the last time but for so unfortunate and unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
an accident. That very night we pitcht upon to make
ourselves full amends for the time which the fire had made
us lose, a Cavalier of my Husband's acquaintance, who was
in some trouble about a Duel, and had fled to an Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors
house, where he did not think himself safe enough from
the Civil Magistrate, was oblig'd to abscond somewhere else.
My Husband carry'd him privately to his own house, and
took himself the key of the street door, which he caus'd to
be lock'd before his face, lest any servant through treachery
or indiscretion shou'd discover the place of his retirement.
This order, at which. I was equally surpriz'd and troubled,
was unluckily put in execution just as <hi>Andrada</hi> made the sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
in the street, which he had told <hi>Marina</hi> of before. The
poor Maid was in a strange confusion, what to do, and made
him a sign from a low Lattice Window to stay a moment.
We deliberated upon the matter a little, and afterwards she
went and told him in a low voice what new obstacle our ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natur'd
destiny had trumpt up to oppose our design; so she
propos'd to him to stay till all our people were gone to bed,
and then he should try to get in through one of the Kitchin
Windows, which she wou'd open for him. Nothing seem'd
difficult or dangerous to <hi>Andrada,</hi> provided he cou'd satisfie
his love. My Husband saw his friend to bed, and went to
bed himself in good time, after the example I set him; all
our Servants did the same; and <hi>Marina,</hi> when she thought
the whole family was fast asleep, open'd the little Window
for <hi>Andrada,</hi> who with all the ease in the world got half
way through, but so indiscreetly or unfortunately, that after
several efforts, which rather did him a mischief than help<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
him, he stuck fast by the wast between the Iron bars of the
Window, without being able to stir backward or forward.
His Valet could not help him from the street, no more cou'd
<hi>Marina</hi> from the place where she was, without some one else
to assist her. So she went to call up one of the Maids, in whom
she cou'd repose confidence, and told her that she had been
over-perswaded that night by her Sweet-heart, whom she
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:53808:229"/>
lov'd intirely, and was to marry in a little time, to try to
let him in at the Kitchin Window, but that he stuck so fast
in the Iron Bars, that there was no getting him out without
filing them, or wrenching them out of their place. She de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sir'd
her therefore to assist her in this extremity, to which the
other readily consented, but for want of a Hammer or some
such Iron utensil, <hi>Andrada</hi> had not been a farthing, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for the help of these two wenches, if he had not be thought
himself of his Ponyard, which did the business so effectually,
that after a great deal of struggling and sweating the Iron
Bars were by main strength wrested from the Wall, and my
Gentleman deliver'd from the terrible fear of being found so
scandalously wedg'd in a place, where he cou'd be taken for
nothing else but a House-breaker. However, this cou'd not
be done with so little noise but that some of the Servants
heard it, and look'd into the street, at the same time when
<hi>Andrada</hi> carrying with him the Iron hoop, which inclos'd
him about the wast, rubb'd off as hard as he cou'd drive, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
by his Foot-man. The neighbours and our servants
cry'd out <hi>Stop Thief</hi> after them, and made no question but
that some Villains had attempted to rob <hi>Don Sancho's</hi> house,
especially when they saw the Iron Bar gone. In the mean
time <hi>Andrada</hi> got safe to his lodgings, and was forc'd to file
off the Iron Bar, which grip'd him as close as a Belt; for
notwithstanding all the tricks that his man and he play'd,
there was no getting it off otherwise. This third accident
put him in a very ill humour, as I came to be inform'd after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.
As for me, I took it quite otherwise, and while
<hi>Marina,</hi> not yet recover'd from her fright, told me the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
I thought I shou'd have kill'd my self with laughing.
However, I was no less concern'd than he, at this series of
disappointments, which rather inflam'd than cool'd our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires,
and wou'd not let us defer the happy minute of enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
any longer, than the very next day after this
pleasant but unlucky Adventure. My Husband was in the
City, endeavouring to make up his friends business for him,
which in all probability would keep him there the remaining
part of the day. I sent trusty <hi>Marina</hi> to <hi>Andrada's</hi> Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

short of my story at last he came, and I receiv'd him with
all the transports of joy which a woman wholly abandon'd
to her passion can feel. I was so blinded by it that I did not
perceive, as well as <hi>Marina</hi> did, with what indifference he
made his approaches to me, altho it was too visible. However
my embraces at last drew on his. Hitherto our mutual joy
could not be otherwise exprest than by our silence, and the
thoughts of what each of us desired with so much ardour,
put me into so great a confusion, that I cou'd not look
<hi>Andrada</hi> in the face, and by this means gave him an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
to attempt what he pleased, when <hi>Marina,</hi> who
like a discreet Chamber-maid had gone out of my room to be
upon the watch, came in all affrighted, and told me my Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
was come home. She carried <hi>Andrada</hi> into my dressing
room, rather dead than alive, and seeming to be much more
concern'd than my self, altho I had more reason to be so.
My husband gave some orders to his people below before he
came up into my chamber. In this interval I had just time
enough to compose my self, and <hi>Marina</hi> to empty a great
coffer full of lumber, into which she put the despairing
<hi>Andrada</hi> She had scarce stow'd up her Lover in this little
sanctuary, when my Husband came into my room, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
kissing me as he pass'd by, without any farther, stay went
into my dressing room, where he found a Book of Plays
and unhappilly open'd it. He lighted upon a place that
pleas'd him, and had engag'd him to read longer, if <hi>Marina</hi>
had not advis'd me to go to him, and try to bring him into
my chamber. My misfortune did not stop here, for <hi>Don
Sancho,</hi> finding me strangely discompos'd and thoughtful, as
I had but too much reason to be, endeavour'd by his own
good humour to put me in a better. Never in his life did he
take so much pains to divert and please me as now, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
did he vex and importune me more. I begg'd him to
quit my chamber, pretending to be so sleepy that I could not
hold up my eyes; but by an unseasonable fit of pleasantry
which was not usual with him neither, he kept me company
in spite of what I cou'd say to him, and tho he was the most
complaisant man alive in his temper, yet he show'd so littl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Marina's</hi> bed. This maid, altho she was concern'd to
the last degree, yet preserved her judgment better than I
did, in this our common misfortune, and bethought herself
how to remedy it, which for my part I wanted strength to
execute, altho my reason had not been disorder'd in the
least. She told me that perhaps <hi>Andrada</hi> was only in a
swoon, and that a Chirurgeon either by bleeding, or some
other speedy relief might restore him that life, which he
seem'd to have lost. I look'd upon her without returning
her any answer, my grief having in a manner made me stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid.
<hi>Marina</hi> lost no time in asking me more questions, but
went to put in execution what she had propos'd to me; but
no sooner had she open'd the door with this intention, but
my brother-in-law <hi>Don Lewis</hi> pop't in upon us, and this se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
disaster was more terrible than the first. Altho the
Body of <hi>Andrada</hi> had not been expos'd to his view, as it was,
yet the confusion and surprize he might read in our faces,
wou'd have told him that we had been engag'd in some mys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterious
affair, which he wou'd not have failed to examine
to the bottom, being so much interess'd in me as he was,
both as a Brother-in-law and a Lover. I was therefore ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to throw my self at the feet of a man, whom I had
often beheld at mine, and relying upon the love which he
had for me, and upon his generosity, the essential quality
of every Gentleman, to resign the dearest thing I had in the
World intirely to his will. He did what he could to raise
me up, but being resolved to continue upon my knees, I
frankly told him, as well as my tears and sighs wou'd give
me leave, what a sad accident had befallen me, at which I
don't at all question but he was pleas'd in his heart. <hi>Don
Lewis,</hi> said I to him, I don't implore thy generosity now to
prolong my Life a few days: my misfortunes have made it
so odious to me, that I wou'd take it away myself, were I
not afraid that my despair cou'd not effect it, but at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
of my honour, from which that of <hi>Don Sancho,</hi> and even
his life are perhaps inseparable. Thou may'st believe, that the
disdain I have all along shown thee, was rather the effect
of my aversion than of my virtue, thou may'st rejoyce at
my disgrace, nay and glut thy revenge with it; but darest
thou reproach me with a crime, which thou hast so often
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:53808:231"/>
tempted me to commit, and canst thou want indulgence
for her, who has so often shown it to thee? <hi>Don Lewis</hi> wou'd
not let me go on, But Madam, says he to me, you see that
Heaven has justly punish'd you for bestowing your affections
upon one, whom you ought to have hated: but I have no
time to lose, that I may convince you, by drawing you out
of this premunire, that you have not a better friend in the
world than <hi>Don Lewis.</hi> Having said this, he left me, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
a moment after with two Porters, whom he had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
to be sent for. <hi>Marina</hi> and I, in the mean time had
put <hi>Andrada's</hi> Body again into the great Coffer. <hi>Don Lewis</hi>
lent a helping hand to put it on the fellow's Shoulders, and
bid them carry it to a certain friend's house, to whom he had

                  </gap>d this Adventure, as he had before trusted him with
the secret of his amour. Here, after he had before taken
<hi>Andrada's</hi> Body out of the Coffer, he ordere'd it to be laid at
full length upon a Table, and while they were taking off his
Cloaths he felt his Pulse, and put his hand on that part of his
breast, where the palpitation of the Heart is best to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd,
and found there were still some sparks of life left in
him. He sent for a Chyrurgeon in all haste, while in the mean
time they put him to Bed, and employ'd all the remedies
that were proper to bring him to himself again. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>ort, he
came to himself, and was blooded. A Servant was left to
attend him, and the company quitted the room to afford
time to nature and rest to compleat that cure, which their
remedies had so successfully begun. You may imagine
how great <hi>Andrada's</hi> surprize was, when after so long a
<hi>deliquium</hi> he found himself in Bed, and cou'd only remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
what a fright he was in, when they put him into the
Coffer; he knew not where he was, nor what he had to hope
or fear. He was taken up with these mortifying thoughts,
when he heard the Chamber door open, and when the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
were drawn, he saw by the light of some tap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>, that
were brought into the room, <hi>Don Lewis,</hi> whom he very
well knew to be my Brother-in-law, and who having taken
a chair, spoke to him as follows. Am I a stranger to you
Signior <hi>Andrada,</hi> and don't you know, that I am Brother to
<hi>Don Sancho?</hi> Yes replied <hi>Andrada,</hi> I know you well enough.
And do you remember, cries <hi>Don Lewis,</hi> what happen'd to you
to day at his House? Take my word for t, continues he, that
if you pretend any more to carry on your intreagues with my
Sister-in-law, or if I ever see you more in our Street, you
shall sorely repent it; and know that thou hadst been a dead
man, if I had not taken compassion on a foolish and unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:53808:231"/>
woman, who has been pleas'd to put her life and honour
in my hand, and if I were not fully assur'd, that thy criminal
designs against my Brother's honour have not been put in
execution. Change your habitation, continues he, and
think not to escape my resentments, if you break the promise
I expect you should make me. <hi>Andrada</hi> promised him more
than he ask'd, he made him the meanest and most abject sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions
he cou'd think of, and protested to him that he ow'd
him a life for saving his now. He was weak enough in all
conscience to keep his bed, but his excessive fear gave him
strength enough to get up. From that very moment he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
as great an aversion for me, as his affection before had
been violent, nay he had my very name in horrour. In the
mean time I was uneasy to know what was become of him,
but I had not assurance enough to ask <hi>Don Lewis,</hi> nay not to
look him in the face. I sent <hi>Marina</hi> to <hi>Andrada's</hi> Lodging,
where she arrived just at the same time as he came in himself,
and had ordered his trunks to be got ready, in order to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
to another quarter of the Town. As soon as he
saw her, he forbad her to come to him any more
from me, and recounting to her in a few words
all that had pass'd between <hi>Don Lewis</hi> and himself;
he added that I was the most ungrateful and most perfidious
woman in the world; that he wou'd only consider me for
the future as one that design'd to ruine him, and desired
that I wou'd no more think of him than if I had never seen
him. Having said this, he turned <hi>Marina</hi> out of his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
who was extremely surprized at his treatment: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
her astonishment was not so great, but that she had
presence of mind enough to dog him him at a distance, and
observing the house where his Trunks were carried, by that
means came to know his new lodging. The vexation I felt
to be accus'd of a crime, whereof I was innocent, and to be
hated by the man, whom I loved so tenderly, and for whom
I had hazarded my life and reputation, hindred me from
taking so much satisfaction in his safety, as otherwise I
should have done. I fell into a fit of melancholy, which
threw me into a sickness, and my distemper, which the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians
cou'd not tell what to make of, was no little afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to my Husband. To compleat my misfortune, <hi>Don Lew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is</hi>
began to value himself upon the important service he had
done me; he incessantly importun'd me to grant him that
happiness, which I had intended for <hi>Andrada:</hi> reproaching
me that I was in love with the latter, all the time I preach'd
to him what I ow'd to my Husband, and what he ow'd to a
Brother. Thus being hated by the man I lov'd, lov'd by
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:53808:232"/>
the man I hated, seeing <hi>Andrada</hi> no more, seeing <hi>Don Lewis</hi>
too often, and perpetually accusing my self for having been
so ungrateful to the best husband in the World, who left
nothing undone to please me, and who was distracted at my
illness, when he had the justest provocations to take away
my life: being thus troubled with remorse of conscience,
of love, and hatred, two passions so contrary, I kept
my Bed for two Months, expecting every moment
my death with joy; but Heaven, it seems reserv'd me
for greater misfortunes. My youth, in spite of my self, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
me against this inconsolable grief. In short, I recover'd
my health, and <hi>Don Lewis</hi> persecuted me much more than
ever he had done. I had given orders to my women, and
particularly to <hi>Marina,</hi> never to leave me alone with him.
Enrag'd at this usage, and the resistance I made him, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd
to obtain by the blackest piece of treachery that ever
was known, that which I refused him with so much steadiness.
I have already told you, that there was a way from his house
to ours, through a door that was seldom shut. On the
night he pitch'd upon for the execution of his damnable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,
and at the hour when he thought every one was
asleep both at his house and ours, he got in by this door,
open'd the gate towards the Street, then turn'd all our Horses,
out of the Stable, that immediately ran into the Court, and
from thence into the Street. The noise they made soon
awaken'd the Servants that looked after them, and my hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.
He was very fond of his Horses, as soon as he knew
that they were got into the Street, he immediately ran af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
them in his Morning Gown, swearing heartily at his
Grooms, and at the Porter, who had forgot to shut the great
Gate. <hi>Don Lewis,</hi> who had hid himself in my Anti-cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
and saw my husband go down stairs, follow'd him into
the Court soon after, and having shut the Street door,
and tarried a little to give the greater probability, to what he
had a mind to effect, came to Bed to me, personating my
husband so well, that 'tis no wonder if I was mistaken. He
was excessive cold with standing so long in his Shirt. Good
God Sir, said I to him, how cold you are! 'Tis very true,
answers he, counterfeiting his voice, I had like to have been
starv'd in the Street. And are your Horses, I said to him,
retaken? My Servants are gone after them, cries he, and
then drawing nearer to me, as to warm himself, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing
me very lovingly, he proceeded to betray me, and
dishonour his brother. As Heaven permitted this crime, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
it reserv'd the punishment of it to me, that so my ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:53808:232"/>
might be retriev'd by my own hands, and my inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
known. Having satisfy'd his wicked desire, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to be in pain for his Horses, so up he got, and open'd
the Street gate, and then retir'd to his own lodging, well
pleas'd perhaps with his crime, and rejoycing in that which
wou'd be the cause of his destruction. My husband came in
soon after, and getting into Bed crept close to me, half frozen
and starv'd as he was, and obliged me by his caresses, which
I thought were extraordinary, to desire him to let me sleep.
He thought it strange; for my part I was surpriz'd, and did
not doubt but that some treacherous trick had been play'd me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
cou'd not sleep a wink till it was day, I got up much earlier
than I us'd to do, I went to Mass, and there I saw <hi>Don
Lewis</hi> in his finest Cloaths, and with his countenanceas gay, as
mine was sad and melancholy. He presented me with the holy
water, which I receiv'd very coldly, then looking upon me
with a malicious sneer, Good God, Madam, says he, how
cold you are! At these words, that were the same I spoke to
him the night before, and made me no longer doubt my mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune,
I turn'd pale and then redden'd. He might easily
find by my eyes, and the disorder these words gave me, how
hainously I resented his insolence. I parted from him, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
so much as looking at him, I pass'd all the time at Mass
very uneasy, as you may well imagine. I made my Husband
so too, when at dinner, and all the rest of the day, I look'd
like a distracted woman, sighing incessantly, and showing
that I was troubled in mind, notwithstanding all the care
I took to conceal it. I retir'd to my Chamber sooner than
I us'd to do, pretending a slight indisposition. I thought of
a hundred different designs to revenge my self. At last my
indignation put me upon that which I resolv'd to put in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.
The night came, I went to bed when my Husband
did: I pretended to sleep to oblige him to do the same; and
when I saw him fast, and suppos'd that all our servants were
so too, I got up, I took his Ponyard, and wholly blinded
and transported by my passion, I made a shift however, by
the same door and the same way through which my cruel ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
had got to my bed, to find the way to his. My fury made
me not do things at random. I grop'd out where his heart
lay with my hand that was free, and discover'd it by its pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitation:
My fear of missing my blow did not make the other
tremble wherein I held the Ponyard. I sheath'd it twice in
the heart of the detestable <hi>Don Lewis,</hi> and punish'd him by a
gentler death than he deserv'd. In the heat of my rage I gave
him five or six hearty stabs more, and return'd to my Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:53808:233"/>
in that tranquillity and peace of mind, that convinc'd me
I never did any thing with more satisfaction. I put up my
husband's Ponyard, all bloody as it was, into the Scabbard:
I drest my self in as much haste, and with as little noise as I
cou'd; I took with me all my Jewels and Money, and as
much transported by my love, as I had been lately hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd
by my revenge, I ran away from my hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
who lov'd me better than his life, to throw my
self into the arms of a young man, who had not long ago
taken care to let me know that I was become odious to him.
The natural cowardise of my Sex was so well fortified
by the impetuous passions that reign'd in my Soul, that tho
it was midnight, and I all alone by my self, yet I walked
from my own house to <hi>Andrada's</hi> Lodging with as much as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance,
as if I had been going to do a good action in the
day time. I knock'd at <hi>Andrada's</hi> door, who was not at home,
being engag'd it seems at play at a friend's house. His Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
who knew me well enough, and were not a little sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd
to see me there, receiv'd me with a great deal of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,
and lighted a fire for me in their Master's Chamber.
He came home soon after, and I suppose little imagin'd to
find me in his Room. He no sooner saw me, but looking
wildly upon me, What has brought you hither, Madam <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genia,</hi>
says he; and what have you to say to me of all men
living, whom you design'd to sacrifice to the revenge of your
Brother-in-law and Gallant? How! <hi>Andrada,</hi> said I to him,
do you put so ill a construction upon an an inevitable acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
which forc'd me to have recourse to the only man in
the world whom I was most afraid to be oblig'd by? and
cou'd you pass so disadvantageous a judgment of a person, who
had given you so many proofs of her affection? I expected
something else than reproaches from you, which you wou'd
not have been in a condition now to make, had I not done
that very thing for which you condemn me, and charge me
with as a crime. Alas! if I have been guilty of a crime, 'tis
not against you, but against my husband, to whom I ought to
have been faithful, to whom I have been ungrateful, because
I wou'd not be so to you, and whom I have left to throw
my self upon a cruel man that uses me ill. When your
death, which I look'd upon to be real, had flung me into
that despair, which how cou'd a woman avoid, that expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
every moment surpriz'd by her husband; and when <hi>Don
Lewis</hi> found me in this deplorable condition, what cou'd I
otherwise do than rely upon his generosity, and the love he
had for me? He has most treacherously betray'd me at the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:53808:233"/>
expence of his own honour, but it has been also at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
of his own life, which I have just now taken from
him: and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tis this, my dear <hi>Andrada,</hi> that has brought me
hither. 'Tis necessary that I shou'd conceal my self from Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
till I find a proper time to inform the world what <hi>Don
Lewis's</hi> crime was, as well as my own misfortune. I have
Money and Jewels enough to maintain you with splendour in
any part of <hi>Spain,</hi> where you will think sit to accompany a
miserable woman. I shall convince the whole world in a
little time that I rather deserve to be pity'd than blam'd, and
my future conduct shall justifie my past actions. Yes, yes,
cry'd he, interrupting me, I will go and take <hi>Don Lewis's</hi>
place, now thou art cloy'd with him, and have my throat
cut like him, when thou art cloy'd with me. Ha! thou
lascivious woman, continues he, how well does this last wicked
action of thine confirm me in my belief that thou designedst
to sacrifice me to thy Gallant? but think not to come off
with reproaches only, I will rather be the punisher of thy
crime, than the accomplice of it. He had no sooner spoke
these words, but he stripp'd me by main force, in so
barbarous a manner, that even his servants were asham'd at
it; he gave me a hundred blows, naked as I was, and after
he had satisfy'd his rage till he was quite weary, he threw me
into the street, where if I had not happily met with you, I
had dy'd e're this, or faln into the hands of those who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
are now searching for me. When she had ended her dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
she shew'd <hi>Don Garcias</hi> the black and blue marks in
her arms, and those parts of her body, which modesty wou'd
allow her to shew, and then resum'd it as follows. You have
heard, generous <hi>Don Garcias,</hi> my deplorable history: Tell
me therefore, I conjure you, what measures an unhappy
woman ought to take, who has caus'd so many calamitous
misfortunes? Ah, Madam, cries <hi>Don Garcias</hi> interrupting her,
that I cou'd as easily advise you what to do, as punish <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drada,</hi>
if you wou'd give me leave! Don't rob me of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of revenging your quarrel, and don't refuse to employ,

that has been done you. <hi>Don Garcias</hi> pronounc'd these words
with a heat, which convinc'd <hi>Eugenia</hi> that he no less lov'd
than pity'd her. She thank'd him in the most obliging terms
that her civility and gratitude cou'd suggest to her, and

what people said of her flight, and of the death of <hi>Don Lewis.</hi>
                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:53808:234"/>
He happened to come there just at the time, as they were
carrying <hi>Don Sancho</hi> to prison, together with his Domesticks,
and those of <hi>Don Lewis,</hi> who had depos'd that their Master
was in love with <hi>Eugenia.</hi> The common door between the two
houses which had been found open, and the Ponyard of <hi>Don
Sancho</hi> yet reeking with blood, were circumstantial proofs that
he had murdred his Brother, of which nevertheless he was
as innocent, as he was afflicted at it. The running away of
his wife, his Jewels and Money that were missing, so strangely
surpriz'd him that he could not tell what to make on't, and
this troubl'd him infinitely more than his imprisonment and
the proceedings of the Magistrate. <hi>Don Garcias</hi> was impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
to carry this news to <hi>Eugenia,</hi> but he cou'd not do it so
soon as he desired. One of his friends, who had business
with him, stopt him a long while in the street where his
lodging was, that happen'd to be over against <hi>Andrada's,</hi>
from whence he saw a servant come out booted, carrying a
Portmantle. He followed him at a distance, accompanied by
his Friend, and saw him stop at the Post-house. He came in
after him, and found he had hired three Horses, that were
to be got ready in half an hour. <hi>Don Garcias</hi> let him go,
and ordered the same number of Horses to be ready at the
same time. His friend ask'd him what was the meaning of
this, he promis'd to tell him, provided he wou'd make one of
the number, to which the other readily consented, without
troubling himself what the matter was. <hi>Don Garcias</hi> desir'd
him to put on his Boots, and stay for him at his Lodgings<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
while he made a short trip to his own. Thus they parted, and
<hi>Don<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> Garcias</hi> went immediately to wait upon <hi>Eugenia</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
her what he knew of her affair. At the same time he gave
orders to his Landlady, who was a woman he cou'd trust,
to furnish <hi>Eugenia</hi> with Cloaths and other necessaries, and
carry her that very night to a Convent, the Governess where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
was her relation and friend. After this he privately or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
his man to carry his riding Coat and Boots to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman's
Lodgings, whom he last parted with, and having
once more conjur'd the woman of the House to take care of
<hi>Eugenia,</hi> and conceal her from all the World, he went to
call upon his Friend, and walked with him to the Post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house,
where they had not been a minute but <hi>Andrada</hi> came
there. <hi>Don Garcias</hi> ask'd him whither he was going, he told
him to <hi>Sevil.</hi> Why then, replied <hi>Don Garcias,</hi> we shall
need but one Postillion. <hi>Andrada</hi> liked the motion, and
perhaps thought <hi>Don Garcias</hi> and his Friend were a brace of
Cullies, whom he might easily bubble of their money at play
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:53808:234"/>
They rode out of <hi>Valladolid</hi> together, and gallop'd a pretty
while, without doing any thing else but gallop, for I think
'tis agreed on all hands, that when men ride post they are
none of the best conversation. <hi>Don Garcias</hi> finding they were
now in a fine open plain, fit for business, and remote enough
from any house, rode a little way before the company, then
come back and bid <hi>Andrada</hi> stop. <hi>Andrada</hi> ask'd him what
he would have. I must fight you, answer'd <hi>Don Garcias,</hi>
to revenge if I can <hi>Eugenia's</hi> quarrel, whom you have mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
injur'd by the most cowardly, and villainous action
that ever was known. I don't repent me for what I have
done, reply'd <hi>Andrada</hi> to him fiercely, without seeming to
be surpriz'd, but perhaps you may have occasion to repent
of this insolence. He was a man of Courage, and alighted
from his Horse at the same time that <hi>Don Garcias</hi> alighted
from his, who would not vouchsafe him an answer. They
were now coming up to one another with their Swords in
hand, when <hi>Don Garcias's</hi> Friend told them that they must
not offer to tilt without him, and offer'd to fight <hi>Andra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da's</hi>
Footman, who was a well shap'd young Fellow, and
of a promising countenance. <hi>Andrada</hi> protested, that altho
he had the best Swordsman in <hi>Spain</hi> for his second, he would
only fight one against one. His Footman not contenting
himself with his Masters protestation, protested likewise, that
for his part he would fight no man whatever, for what cause
whatever, at any Weapon whatever. So <hi>Don Garcias's</hi>
friend was forc'd to be an humble Spectator, or if you please,
Godfather to the two Combatants, which is no new thing
in <hi>Spain.</hi> The Duel did not last long, heaven so much fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
the righteous cause of <hi>Don Garcias,</hi> that his Enemy
pressing upon him with more fury than skill, ran upon his
Sword, and fell down at his feet, losing his blood and life
together. <hi>Andrada's</hi> Footman and the Postboy, neither of
whom were made for Heroes, threw themselves at the
Feet of <hi>Don Garcias,</hi> who meant them no mischief. He
commanded <hi>Andrada's</hi> Footman to open his Masters Port<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantle,
and give him all that <hi>Andrada</hi> had taken from
<hi>Eugenia.</hi> He obey'd him immediately, and put into his
hand a rich Manteau Gown and Petty-coat, and a little
Box, which by its weightiness would have made a blind
man swear that it was not empty. The Footman found the
Key of it in his Masters pocket, and gave it to <hi>Don Garcias,</hi>
who bid him do what he pleased with his Master's body,
threatning to cut his throat if he ever saw him in <hi>Valladolid.</hi>
He commanded the Postboy not to come back till the dusk
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:53808:235"/>
of the evening, and promis'd him he should find the two
Horses, that he had hired, at the Post-house. I suppose he
was punctually obey'd by these two worthy Gentlemen,
who were ready to dye for fear, and thought they were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
oblig'd to him, because he did not kill them as
he had done <hi>Andrada.</hi> History leaves us in the dark as to
what his Footman did with his Body, and as for his move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables,
'tis very probable that he kept them for his own
use. Our Memoirs likewise are wanting to inform
us how the Post-boy manag'd himself in this affair. <hi>Don
Garcias</hi> and his Friend gallop'd it all the way to <hi>Valladolid,</hi>
and alighted at the Imperial Ambassador's House, where they
had Friends, and stay'd till it was night. <hi>Don Garcias</hi> sent
for his Footman, who told him that <hi>Eugenia</hi> was in pain to
see him. The Horses were sent back to the Post-house by
an unknown person, who cunningly rubb'd off, after he
had deliver'd them to one of the Ostlers. As for <hi>Andrada</hi>'s
death, the people of <hi>Valladolid</hi> either talked nothing of it,
because they never heard a word of it, or if they talk'd of
it, they said no more but that a Cavalier was kill'd by some
unknown Enemy, or by Thieves. <hi>Don Garcias</hi> return'd to
his Lodgings, where he found <hi>Eugenia</hi> drest in the Cloaths
which his Landlady had taken care to provide for her. I
am apt to believe that she took them up at a Broker's, for in
<hi>Spain</hi> 'tis a common thing for persons of quality, both men
and women, to rig themselves in such places. He restor'd <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genia</hi>
her things again, and particularly her Jewels, and inform'd
her after what manner he had revenged her quarrel upon <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drada.</hi>
Being of a sweet and tender disposition, she was extreme<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
concerned for the unfortunate end of a person, whom she
had once lov'd so dearly, and the thoughts that she was
the cause of so many Tragical disasters, afflicting her as much
as her own misfortunes, caus'd her to shed abundance of
tears. That day publick notice had been given at <hi>Valladolid</hi>
that no one should entertain or conceal <hi>Eugenia,</hi> and two
hundred Crowns were offered by way of reward to any one
that cou'd bring any news of her. This made her resolve to
get into a Convent as soon as she cou'd. However she
pass'd that night in the lodging where she was, and slept as
little as she did the night before. <hi>Don Garcias</hi> rose by
break of day to go visit the Governess of the Convent that was
related to <hi>Eugenia,</hi> and promis'd to receive her, and keep
her private as long as she was able. From thence he went
to hire a Coach, and order'd it to stop at a by-street adjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his, whither <hi>Eugenia</hi> came, accompanied by the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:53808:235"/>
Gentlewoman of the house, both of them being covered in
their veils. The Coach carried them to a certain place, where
they ordered the Coachman to set them down, and there
they alighted, that no one should find out the Convent,
where <hi>Eugenia</hi> retired. She was courteously entertained
there; <hi>Don Garcias</hi>'s Landlady took her leave of her, and
went to inform herself how matters were like to go with
<hi>Don Sancho.</hi> She was told that things look'd with an ill as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect,
and that the least they talked of doing to him was to
give him the Question. <hi>Don Garcias</hi> communicated this
news to <hi>Eugenia,</hi> who was so much concern'd to see her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
in danger of being punished for a crime, which he was
no way guilty of, that she was resolved to surrender herself in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the hands of Justice. <hi>Don Garcias</hi> disswaded her from it,
and advis'd her rather to write to the Judge Criminal to
let him know, that only she could inform him who it was
that kill'd <hi>Don Lewis.</hi> Upon this the Judge, who by good
luck was related to her, went attended with several other
Officers of Justice, to discourse her. She freely confess'd to
them that she had kill'd <hi>Don Lewis,</hi> acquainted them with
the just provocation he had given her to serve him so, and
recounted to them the particulars of all that had pass'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Don Lewis</hi> and herself, except what related to <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drada.</hi>
Her confession was taken down in writing, and a
report of it made to his Catholick Majesty, who, considering
the blackness of <hi>Don Lewis</hi>'s crime, the just resentment of
<hi>Eugenia,</hi> her courage and resolution, the innocence of <hi>Don
Sancho</hi> and his Domesticks, order'd them all to be set at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
and granted his Royal Pardon to <hi>Engenia,</hi> at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of all the Court, who appear'd in her behalf. Her
husband was not much displeas'd with her for the death of
his Brother, nay, if one knew the truth, perhaps he lov'd
her the better for it. He made her a visit as soon as he was
enlarg'd, and would fain have taken her home with him, but
she would not consent to it, notwithstanding all his impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities
and prayers. She did not question but that he took
<hi>Don Lewis</hi>'s death as he ought to take it, but she knew
very well that he had heard something of what had pass'd
between her and the <hi>Portuguese</hi> Cavalier; that the least ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish
in a Womans honour may raise her Husbands jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy,
and sooner or later untie the Conjugal Knot, let it be
never so well ty'd. Poor <hi>Don Sancho</hi> visited her often, and
endeavour'd by all the tenderest remarks of kindness he
could shew her, to oblige her to return home, and be abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Mistress of his Estate and him. She continu'd inflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:53808:236"/>
in her resolution, reseruing for her self a pension suitable
to her quality and fortune: But though <hi>Don Sancho</hi> could
not prevail with her to go home with him, yet she behav'd
herself so obligingly to this good Husband, that he had all
the reason in the world to speak well of her. But all that
she did in the Convent to please him, only encreas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d his
concern that he was not able to get her out of it. This
threw him at last into so deep a melancholy, that he fell
sick, and his sickness brought him to deaths door. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd
<hi>Eugenia</hi> to give him the satisfaction of seeing her, before
he must part with her for ever. She could not refuse this
sorrowful pleasure to a Husband who had been so dear to
her, who had lov'd her so tenderly, and who still lov'd her
so well. She went to see him dye, and had like to have
dy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d herself with grief, to see him shew so much joy in
seeing her, as if she had restor'd that life to him, he was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to lose. This goodness of <hi>Eugenia</hi> did not go unreward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
he left her all he had, by which means she found her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
one of the richest and beautifullest Widows in <hi>Spain,</hi>
after she had found herself upon the brink of being one of
the most unhappy Women in the world. Her affliction for
the death of her husband was as real as it was great. She
gave necessary orders for his Funeral, took possession of his
Estate, and return'd to her Convent, resolving to pass the
remainder of her days there. Her Relations propos'd to her
the best matches in <hi>Spain,</hi> but she was resolv'd not to sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
her repose to her ambition: and finding herself ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lastingly
persecuted by crowds of pretenders, whom her
beauty and wealth drew after her to the Parlor of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
where she was, she would at last be seen by no one
but <hi>Don Garcias.</hi> This young Gentleman had serv'd her so
opportunely upon so important an occasion, and with so much
warmth, that she could not see him without saying to herself
that she ow'd him something more than bare civilities and
compliments. She discovered by his livery and equipage
that he was not over-rich, and she was generous enough to
offer him some assistances, which a person in ordinary cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
may receive without shame from one that is
richer than himself. In the little time she had been at his
lodgings, and in the conversation he had often had with
her, he made her sensible that he had a lofty soul elevated above
the common rank, and entirely disengag'd from all fordid
Interests, and wholly devoted to honour. She was therefore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
that she should affront him if she made him any present,
which to be sure wou'd have been answerable to her gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:53808:236"/>
temper, and on the other hand she fear'd that he wou'd
have but a sorry opinion of her gratitude, if she did not give
him some proofs of it by her liberality. But if <hi>Don Garcias</hi>
gave her some pain upon the aforesaid occasion, she gave
him no less on her side, and so was even with him. In short,
he was in love with her, but tho the respect he bore her cou'd
not have hinder'd him from acquainting her with it, how
durst he mention the word Love to a Woman, whom Love
had so lately expos'd to such terrible misfortunes, and that
at a time too, when the sorrowful air of her face, and the
tears which trickl'd down incessantly, were evident de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations,
that her Soul was yet too full of grief to be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of receiving another passion: Among the rest that
made their visits to <hi>Eugenia,</hi> in quality of her thrice-humble
Slaves, in hopes I suppose to become one day her thrice im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious
Masters; among the rest, I say, who had offer'd
themselves to her, and she had refus'd, there was one <hi>Don
Diego,</hi> who having nothing else to distinguish him, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd
to signalize himself by his constant persecutions. He
was as foolish as 'tis possible for a young fellow to be, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mannerly
as he was foolish, as troublesome as he was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mannerly,
and hated by all the world for being troublesome,
unmannerly, and foolish. His body was of a peice with his
soul, ugly and ill-fashion<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d, he was as poor in respect of the
blessings of this transitory world, as he was covetous to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
them. But being descended from one of the best families
in <hi>Spain,</hi> and nearly related to one of the principal Ministers
of State, which only helpt to make him the more inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
people shew'd him some little respect for the sake of
his quality, altho it was not recommended by the least merit.
This <hi>Don Diego,</hi> who was for all the world such a Spark as
I have describ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d him, thought that <hi>Eugenia</hi> had every thing
that a man cou'd desire in a woman, and hop'd to obtain
her with ease by the credit of his friends at Court, who
and promis'd to make up the match for him. But <hi>Euge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi>
was not to be so easily perswaded into an affair of that
importance, as they imagin'd, and to favour a private man
the Court wou'd not commit a violence that must needs
have disgusted all the World. <hi>Eugenia</hi>'s retiring into a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ent,
her resolution never to leave it, her positive orders
to receive no more visits, the coldness of those that at first
encourag'd <hi>Don Diego</hi> in his pretensions, made him despair
of ever obtaining her without difficulty. For this reason he
was resolv'd to carry her by main force out of her Convent,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="116" facs="tcp:53808:237"/>
                  <hi>Spain,</hi> and which none but a fool like himself would ever
have dreamt of. He found for his money fellows that were as
great fools as himself, and gave orders to have fresh horses
left upon the Road down to the Sea-side, where a Vessel lay
ready for him; in short, he forc'd the Convent, carried off
<hi>Eugenia,</hi> and that unfortunate Lady had become the prey
of the most dishonourable Wretch alive, if Heaven had not
rais'd up an unexpected Champion for her, even then when
she thought herself most abandon'd by it. One single Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,
whom <hi>Eugenia</hi>'s cryes drew after her ravishers, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
their whole body, and hinder'd them from passing far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
with so much valour that he immediately wounded
<hi>Don Diego,</hi> and several of his Accomplices, and gave time
to the Townsmen, who had taken the alarm, and to the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Magistrate to come down upon them with such numbers
as to force <hi>Don Diego</hi> and his Companions to surrender, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

but before she would suffer herself to be carry'd <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

valiant Gentleman, who had so gallantly exposed his life
for her sake. They found him wounded in several parts of

she gave such tender proofs it, that the standers by might

of a cure. She implored the assistance of heaven, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
to give the Chirurgeons whatever they could demand;
but their Art was exhausted, and they had no hopes but in
heaven, and the youth of the sick party. <hi>Eugenia</hi> would
not stir from his bed-side, and attended him night and day
so carefully, that she was in danger of bringing herself into
the same condition, I mean, of wanting another to do the
same offices for herself. She heard him often pronounce
her name in the delirious fits of his Fever, and among a
thousand incoherent things, which his disturb'd imagination
made him say, she heard him often talk of love, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
like a man that is afighting or quarrelling. At last
Nature, assisted by so many remedies, surmounted the obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy
of his illness; his Fever abated, his wounds began to
close up, and the Chyrurgeons assured <hi>Eugenia</hi> there was no
danger, provided no unexpected accidents befell him. She
gave them handsom presents for their pains, and order'd
Prayers to be put up in all the Churches of <hi>Valladolid.</hi> 'T was
at this time that <hi>Don Garcias</hi> was inform'd by <hi>Eugenia</hi> that
she was the woman whom he had sav'd, and that she came
to be inform'd by him how he happen'd to come so seasonably
to her relief, as he was returning home from a friends house.
She cou'd not forbear to let him know how many obligations
she had to him, and he cou'd not conceal his excessive joy
for serving her so opportunely, but durst not presume to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
her with a thing of greater importance. One day
when she was all alone with him, and conjur'd him not to
let her be any longer ungrateful to him, but to make use of
her upon some important occasion, he thought it a proper
time to discover the real sentiments of his soul. He sighed
at the very thought of what he was going to do, he look'd

man in the world. With all the good qualities that
you possess, I cannot believe you to be so unhappy, as you
talk, replies <hi>Eugenia.</hi> How Madam, says he to her, don't
you think that man very unhappy, who knows your value,
who esteems you more than any one living, who loves you
better than his life, and with all this, who cannot pretend
to merit you, tho Fortune had been as favourable as she has
hitherto been averse to him? You mightily surprize me,
said she to him blushing, but the great obligations I have
to you, give you a priviledge with me, that under my
present circumstances I should allow in none but your
self. Only think of getting well, continued she, and rest
assured that your misfortunes shall not trouble you long,
when it is in <hi>Eugenia</hi>'s power to put an end to them. She
would not stay for his answer, and by that means sav'd
him a world of Compliments, which fell out luckily for
him, because he must have strain'd hard to make good ones,
and that perhaps might have done him harm in his present
weakness. She call'd to some of her Servants that look'd af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
him, and went out of the room, just as the Chirurgeons
came in. Satisfaction of Mind is a Soveraign remedy to a
sick body. <hi>Don Garcias</hi> gather'd such hopes of the happy
success of his Amour from <hi>Eugenia</hi>'s words, that from the
deep Melancholy, wherein he was plunged like a despairing
Lover, he now gave up himself to joy, and this joy contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
more to his cure, than all the Remedies of the Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeons.
He was perfectly cur'd, and out of good manners
quitted <hi>Eugenia</hi>'s house, but not his pretensions to her heart.
She had promis'd to love him, provided he did not make
any publick discovery of it; and after all perhaps she lov'd
him as much as he lov'd her, but having lately lost her
Husband, and been engaged in some adventures, which

constancy. He was so well made in his person, as to make
any Rival whatever despair. He was a younger brother of
one of the best Families of <hi>Arragon,</hi> and altho he had not

so many obligations from him. In short, she marry'd
him: Both Court and City approved her choice; and that

               <p>UNder a King of <hi>Naples,</hi> whose name I cannot tell, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
I suppose it might be <hi>Alphonso, Leonard de St Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin,</hi>
Prince of <hi>Tarento,</hi> was one of the greatest Lords of his
Kingdom, and one of the most celebrated Generals of his
time. He died, and left the Principality of <hi>Tarento</hi> to his
Daughter <hi>Mathilda,</hi> a young Princess about seventeen years
old: as beautiful as an Angel, and as good condition'd as
she was beautiful, but so extremely good condition'd, that
those that did not know she had an infinite deal of wit,
would have been apt to call it in question. Her Father long
before his death had promis'd her in marriage to <hi>Prosper,</hi>
Prince of <hi>Salerno.</hi> This latter was a man of a haughty disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
temper, and the sweet and gentle <hi>Mathilda,</hi> by
virtue of being long accustomed to bear with him, was so
well prepared to love and fear him, that never did Slave de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
more upon the imperious will of his Master, than this
young Princess did upon that of old <hi>Prosper.</hi> I think a
man at the age of forty-five may very well be call'd old,
when he is mention'd with one so young as <hi>Mathilda.</hi> Her
affection to this superannuated Lover may be said to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
rather from custom than inclination, and was as sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
as his was interressed. Not but that he was as fond of
her too, as 'twas as possible for him to be, and this was no
more than what any man would have done as well as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
for indeed she was all amiable; but 'twas not in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:53808:239"/>
of the beast (I beg his pardon, but 'tis out) to love ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
much, and he rather esteem'd a Mistress for her dirty
acres and unrighteous Mammon, than for her merit and
beauty. The truth is, he made love but awkwardly: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he was so happy, or, to express my self more properly,
she was so easy to be pleased, that altho he did not pay her
half the respect and complaisance which one might expect
from a generous Lover, yet for all that he was absolute
master of her heart, and had brought her to such a pass as
to submit to all his ill conditions. He found fault with all
her actions, and plagued her incessantly with those musty ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
that old men in their great wisdom so often inculcate
to the young, and the other so little care for. In short, he
would have been a greater thorn in her side, than a peevish
malicious Governante, if he could have found out any faults
in her conduct. It is true, that when he was in a good hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
he would tell her stories of the old Court, play on
his Guitarre, and dance a Saraband before her. I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
told you his age, but to go on with his Character. He
was spruce in his Person and Cloaths; curious in his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiwigs,
an infallible sign that his hair was none of the best;
he took mighty care of his Teeth, tho time began to play
tricks with them; he valued himself. upon his Lilly-white
hands, and suffer'd the Nail of his left little Finger to grow
to a prodigious length, by the same token he thought it one
of the prettiest sights in the world. He was nice to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
in his Feathers and Ribbonds, punctually twisted up
his Mustachio's every night, was always perfum'd, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
carry'd some tid bit in his pocket to eat, and some
Verses to read. As for himself, he was an execrable versi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyer,
was a walking Magazine of all the new Songs, play'd
upon most Instruments, perform'd his Exercises with a
grace, but his chief Talent was Dancing. He lov'd the wits
that ask'd him nothing, had perform'd some actions in
his time that were brave, and some that were otherwise,
and as one might say, he had two Buzzards to one Hawk,
or if you please, two Blanks to one Benefit. In short, I
may properly apply to him a burlesque Song of my own ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
the latter part of which is almost worn into a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb.</p>

               <p>With all these fine qualities, one of the loveliest Princesses in
the world was desperately in love with him. 'Tis true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
she was but seventeen years old; but our Noble
Prince of <hi>Salermo</hi> did not stand much upon that. There is no
doubt but the Princess <hi>Mathilda,</hi> being so rich and beautiful
as she was, would have had a hundred Gallants more, if it
had not been universally believed in <hi>Naples,</hi> that her Marriage
with <hi>Prosper</hi> was as good as concluded in her Father's time,
or if that Prince's quality had not discouraged other preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
who (tho they wanted his Title) were men of fortune
and birth good enough to be his Rivals. Thus the greatest
part of these Lovers, either govern'd by a principle of fear
or discretion, were content to sigh for her in private, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
daring to speak. <hi>Hippolito</hi> was the only man that had
the courage to own himself in publick the Rival of <hi>Prosper,</hi>
and the respective Lover of <hi>Mathilda.</hi> He was descended
from one of the best Families in <hi>Spain,</hi> and came in a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect

                     </gap> Avalos,</hi> Constable of
<hi>Castile,</hi> who was so remarkable an instance of the inconstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of fortune, since from the richest and most powerful
Grandee of his own Country, he was turned out of it poor
and miserable, forced to borrow money of his Friends, and
fly to the King of <hi>Arragon,</hi> who took him into his own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection,
and gave him a fortune sufficient at <hi>Naples</hi> to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
him according to his quality. This <hi>Hippolito</hi> was
one of the most accomplish'd Cavaliers of his time: His
valour had gain'd him reputation in several parts of
<hi>Europe,</hi> and all the world own'd him to be a man of the
nicest honour. As I have already told you, he was an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
admirer of <hi>Mathilda,</hi> and tho he could never hope to
succeed, so long as she loved <hi>Prosper,</hi> yet he resolved to love
her on to the end of the Chapter. He was liberal even to
prodigality, whereas his Rival was thrifty even to avarice.
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:53808:240"/>
He omitted not the least opportunity to shew his Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
to <hi>Mathilda,</hi> and altho he carried it as far as his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
would give him leave, yet she seldom saw it, for her
Tyrant <hi>Prosper</hi> hindred her from giving any countenance to
these gallantries of love, let them come from what quarter
they would. Our obstinate Lover frequently ran at the
Ring before his Mistress's Window, often gave her Serenades,
and diverted her with Tilts and Tournaments. The cipher
and colours of <hi>Mathilda</hi> were to be seen in all his Liveries:
the praises of <hi>Mathilda</hi> rung through all <hi>Italy,</hi> in the verses
he composed, and in the Airs and Songs he caused to be
made; but she was no more mov'd with all this, than if she
had known nothing of it. Nay, by the express order or
the Prince of <hi>Salerno,</hi> she must go out of <hi>Naples,</hi> whenever
there was to be any Running at the Ring, Dancing, or any
Gallantries of the like nature, which the amorous <hi>Hippolito</hi>
provided for her. To make short, she affected to disoblige
him upon all occasions, with a cruelty that seem'd to be a
violence upon her Nature, and made all the world exclaim
against her. This did not in the least discourage <hi>Hippolito,</hi>
and the ill treatment of <hi>Mathilda</hi> encreas'd his love instead
of lessening it. He did more than this: he shew'd that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to <hi>Prosper,</hi> which he did not owe him, and to please
<hi>Mathilda,</hi> paid him the same deference, which is usually
shewn to persons of superiour quality, altho there was no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
difference between the Prince of <hi>Salerno</hi> and him, than
their Estate. In short, he respected his Mistress in his Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val,
and perhaps forbore to hate him, because he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lov'd
by <hi>Mathilda.</hi> But <hi>Prosper</hi> was not so complaisant: he
hated <hi>Hippolito</hi> mortally, he made a hundred scurvy jests
upon him, nay, would never have scrupl'd to tell lies of
him, if he thought any one would have believ'd them. But
<hi>Hippolito</hi> was the delight of <hi>Naples,</hi> and his reputation was
so well establish'd there, that altho he had actually deviated
from his Character, he could hardly have destroy'd it. Thus
<hi>Prosper</hi> was the happy man, and stood possess'd of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thilda</hi>'s
affection, tho he did nothing to deserve it. That
beautiful Princess did not think she saw him often enough,
tho she saw him every day, when Fortune all on the sudden
threw her from the heighth of happiness, into the extremity
of misery. She had a Cousin-german by her Father's side,
who might have pass'd for a man of merit, had he been a
man of less ambition and avarice; he had been bred up with
the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> was of the same age, and had insinuated himself
so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> his good graces, that he was the sole manager of
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:53808:241"/>
all his pleasures and sports, and the dispenser of all his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours.
This <hi>Roger de St Severin</hi> (for so he was call'd) was
posses'd with a fancy, that the Principality of <hi>Tarento</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed
to him, and that a Daughter could not legally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit
it, to the prejudice of the Male line. He spoke to the
King about it, who encourag'd him to claim his right, and
promis'd to support him by his Authority. The affair was
kept secret; <hi>Roger</hi> made himself Master of <hi>Tarento,</hi> and had
plac'd a good Garrison there, before <hi>Mathilda</hi> had the least
mistrust of it. Our poor Princess, who had never been in
any trouble before, was as it were thunder-struck with this
news. No one but <hi>Hippolito</hi> declar'd himself in her favour,
who scorn'd to truckle to the King's Favourite; and <hi>Prosper,</hi>
who was more oblig'd to her than any man living, did even
less for her than any man, whereas <hi>Hippolito</hi> not only dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charg'd
his duty, but was carry'd by his zeal beyond it.
He waited on her to offer her his service, but she durst not
accept of it, for fear of disobliging her Prince of <hi>Salerno,</hi>
who since her misfortune did not visit her so often as he
us'd to do, when she was peaceable Mistress of <hi>Tarento.</hi> In
the mean time <hi>Hippolito</hi> talk'd boldly of the injustice that
was done her, and sent a challenge to <hi>Roger:</hi> for which he
had Guards placed about him, and was commanded to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist;
but as he was generally belov'd by all people, he might
have easily rais'd a party in <hi>Naples,</hi> strong enough to
have made the Favourite doubt the success of his ill designs.
He made several attempts upon <hi>Tarento,</hi> all which miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd,
by reason of the great care <hi>Roger</hi> had taken to prevent
all accidents of that nature. At last the breach between
the two pretenders growing wider every day, and most of
the <hi>Italian</hi> Princes interesting themselves one way or t'other,
the Pope imploy'd his mediation to procure a peace, made
them lay down their arms, and prevail'd with the King of
<hi>Naples</hi> to refer the decision of the dispute between his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite
and <hi>Mathilda,</hi> to Judges of known integrity. The
Reader may easily guess what an extraordinary expence <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polito</hi>
was at, being the head of a Party, and so liberal in his
temper; he may likewise easily imagine, that <hi>Mathilda,</hi> as
much a Princess as she was, was in a short time reduced to
very pressing necessities. <hi>Roger</hi> had possess'd himself of her
Lands. He had perswaded the King that she kept private
intelligence with his Enemies; her rents were no longer
paid, and no one durst lend money to the woman, whom
the Favourite had a mind to ruin. <hi>Prosper</hi> ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> she

less resented his ingratitude, than his forgetfulness. <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polito</hi>
would not offer her money, because he knew she wou'd
refuse it, but went a more generous way to work. He sent
her some by one of his Friends, who took the honour of it
upon himself, and without telling her that it came from
<hi>Hippolito,</hi> oblig'd that Princess by oath never to talk of it,
lest this kindness might draw upon him the indignation of
the Favourite. In the mean time the Process came on, and
sentence was given in favour of <hi>Mathilda.</hi> The King was
displeased at it, <hi>Roger</hi> was enrag'd, the Court was astonish'd,
every one was vex'd, or rejoyc'd according to his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
or interest, but the generality of people admir'd
and prais'd the probity of the Judges. <hi>Mathilda,</hi> who to
her glory had obtained so important a Process, sent a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
to <hi>Prosper,</hi> with a transport that can hardly be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined,
to acquaint him with the happy success of her
affair. <hi>Prosper<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> rejoyced exceedingly at the news, and to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stify
it to this Gentleman, he hugg'd and embrac'd him at
a strange rate, and promised to serve him, whenever an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oportunity
should present itself. <hi>Hippolito</hi> knew nothing of
it till after his Rival, yet he bestowed a Diamond Ring of
great value upon the man that brought him the news. He
feasted all the Court, prepar'd Lists before <hi>Mathilda</hi>'s win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
and for eight days together run at the Ring against all
people. Gallantries of this nature generally make a great
noise. Several Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> and most of <hi>Mathilda</hi>'s
Relations and Friends were present at it, and signaliz'd
themselves: nay, the King himself, who passionately ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir'd
this sort of Exercise, was pleased to honour it with his
Royal Presence. <hi>Roger</hi> had interest enough with his Master
to have hinder'd him, but by a cunning fetch of his politics
he had reconcil'd himself to <hi>Mathilda,</hi> and declar'd to all
the world, that unless he had really thought that <hi>Tarento</hi>
belonged to him, he would never have attempted to make
himself Master of it. The King was mightily pleas'd with
him for so readily submitting to the sentence of the Judges,
and that he might recompence him for the loss of his trial,
and his pretensions upon <hi>Tarento,</hi> gave him one of the most
important Governments of the Kingdom, besides the places
he had before. <hi>Hippolito</hi> perform'd wonders at running at
the Ring, and carry'd away the honour of it. <hi>Prosper</hi> had
a mind to dispute it with him, so all be-plumb'd and be-fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd,
that any one would have taken him for an <hi>American</hi>
Prince. But he was thrown the very first course, either
through his own fault or that of his Horse's, and was suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:53808:242"/>
bruis'd, or at least pretended so to be. He was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd
to <hi>Mathilda</hi>'s house, who for vexation quitted her Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cony,
and curs'd the amorous <hi>Hippolito</hi> a hundred times for
his pains. He came to hear of it, and was so concern'd
that he broke up the Assembly, and retir'd in the greatest
despair, to a fine house he had within a league of <hi>Naples.</hi>
In the mean time <hi>Prosper</hi> was so enrag'd at his fall, that he
treated <hi>Mathilda</hi> after a most terrible manner, telling her
that she was the cause of his disgrace, and reproach'd her
with being in love with <hi>Hippolito. Mathilda,</hi> always gentle,
always humble, and always blindly fond of her haughty
Tyrant, begg'd his pardon, and in short, was as chicken-hearted,
as he was brutal. <hi>Hippolito</hi> had a Sister that was
bred up with the Queen of <hi>Spain,</hi> and was lately return'd
to <hi>Naples,</hi> for reasons that I don't know, and signify nothing
to our history. Besides that she was beautiful to a miracle,
she was a Lady of extraordinary merit, that rendred her
deserving of the vows of the best men in the Kingdom. At
her return from <hi>Spain,</hi> she found her Brothers Affairs in so
low a condition, that when he set up the running at the
Ring, she would not appear at Court, because she wanted
an Equipage suitable for a person of her quality, but always
kept at her Brother's house, which was all that was left him
of his Estate, for he had parted with his Lands. She came
<hi>Incognito</hi> to see the running at the Ring, and observing her
Brother break up the Company, and leave <hi>Naples</hi> so abrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
follow'd him home, and found him in the most lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
condition that could be. He had broke his Lances, tore
his Feathers and his Hair, mangl'd his Cloaths and his Face;
in short, he was in such a distraction, that she would have
despair'd of ever seeing him come to his Senses again, had
she not known very well, that a smile, nay an indifferent
look from <hi>Mathilda,</hi> would have made him forget a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
ill treatments. She did all that lay in her power to
bring him to a good humour, gave way to his passion instead
of combating it, rail'd at <hi>Mathilda,</hi> when he storm'd against
her; and said all the good things she could think of her,
when after all his Transports the Scene chang'd, and she
found him the most amorous Lover that ever was. But the
surly <hi>Prosper</hi> had not the same complaisance for <hi>Mathilda;</hi>
his fall still broil'd in his Stomach, and he daily laid it to
her charge, tho' she was by no means accessary to it. One
day, when after having thank'd her Judges, she went to
wait upon the King to thank him likewise, altho he had
been against her; but a Court 'tis a point of indiscretion to
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:53808:242"/>
speak one's real thoughts, or receive a denial otherwise than
with fawning and cringing: One day therefore when she
was in the King's Anti-Chamber, she saw the obsequious
<hi>Prosper</hi> come in. Ever since his fall he had never made her a
visit but to scold and quarrel with her for suffering <hi>Hippolito</hi>
to run at the Ring under her window. Nothing could be
more unjust than <hi>Prosper</hi>'s complaints. It was not in <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thilda</hi>'s
power to hinder a publick diversion, even tho it had
not been design'd for her sake, since her Palace took up one
side of the great square: and altho it had been in her power,
yet she ought not to have done it, unless she resolv'd to be
thought a woman of no manners nor gratitude. <hi>Prosper</hi> was
the only man, who by his false way of his reasoning fancied
that she had done him an irreparable injury, and his anger
sowr'd him to that degree that he went no more to visit her,
as if he had broke off with her for good and all. The poor
Princess was ready to run distracted about it, and no sooner
saw this Tyrant of hearts, who was just going into the King's
chamber, but she threw herself in his way and stopt him.
He endeavour'd to avoid her, and press'd forward: she caught
hold of him by the arm, and casting a look at him that was
enough to charm any one but this haughty Brute, she ask'd
him, what she had done to him that he should shun her
thus. What have you not done, repli'd this Prince arrogant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and how can you ever retrieve the reputation you have
lost by suffering the Gallantries of <hi>Hippolito.</hi> I cannot hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
them, nor hinder him from loving me, answers <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thilda,</hi>
but 'tis in my power not to approve either his Love,
or his Gallantry; and I think, continues she, that I have
sufficiently testified my dislike of them, when I went from
my Balcony, before the show was over. You should not have
appear'd there at all, replies <hi>Prosper,</hi> and the reason why
you went a way at last was only because you saw all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
pointed at you for being there. But your love for <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polito</hi>
has made you lose all your reason, and his Gallantries
have quite effac'd all the services I am capable of doing you.
<hi>Mathilda</hi> was vext to the heart to hear this, and was going
to answer him, but he wou'd not give her time: besides
the anger, that appear'd in his countenance, made the
Princess so afraid of him that she was perfectly speechless.
When you were no more Mistriss of <hi>Tarento,</hi> said he to her,
and the King order'd you to be apprehended, I had a mind
to see how far your indiscretion and mean spirit would carry
you, and whether Adversity could cure your faults. For
this reason I made no Feasts like your Gallant, nay I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:53808:243"/>
to be no longer in your Interesta. In the mean time
<hi>Hippolito</hi> made a mighty bustle, and did you little service,
and your affairs for a long time seem'd to be in a desperate
condition. Then you cou'd condescend to make some ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances
towards me, in order to bring me back to you again,
but this was only a copy of your countenance, since you still
preserv'd your <hi>Hippolito.</hi> Your Politicks I confess were not
amiss: You drain'd this poor despicable Gallant while he
had a drop to part with, flattering your self, that after you
had exhausted him to all intents and purposes, you should
do me an extraordinary favour to take me in his room; and
you made account, that although you should lose <hi>Tarento</hi> at
your Trial, yet your Beauty would make you Princess of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerno,</hi>
when ever you pleas'd. But no sooner did a favourable
Decree revive your hopes, but you chang'd your Maxim of
State with your Maxim of Love. You thought that a young
ruin'd Prodigal would better fit your turn than me, and
consider'd, that if you married the Prince of <hi>Salerno,</hi> you
must expect to live with a Master, authoriz'd by Custom and
the Laws, whereas you would find in <hi>Hippolito</hi> a supple Slave,
that would make it all his business to please you. Impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Princess! continued he, durst such a poor needy wretch
as <hi>Hippolito</hi> pretend to make love to a Woman of your Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
unless she gave him encouragement; and can any one
believe, that for bare hopes only, he would have put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to such an expence, that he's utterly beggar'd; and so
foolishly too, that he enrich'd, with one single Present, the
Man that came from you, to bring him the news that you
had gain'd your cause? Yet after all these Testimonies I have
of your indiscretion and infidelity, you are vain enough to
believe that I love you never the worse for them. Be happy
if you can with your <hi>Hippolito,</hi> but delude your self no
longer that I will be unhappy with <hi>Mathilda.</hi> He would have
left her after he had spoke these words, but the Princess still
kept her hold, and once in her life had the courage to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict
him. Ungrateful Prince! said she to him, one of
the greatest proofs I can give thee that I yet love thee, is not
to hate thee, after thou hast said so many disobliging things
to me. They rather make against thee than me, and I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
employ them better to thy confusion and my own ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
than by confessing that they are true. Yes, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
she, <hi>Hippolito</hi> has lov'd me; <hi>Hippolito</hi> to serve me,
neither fear'd the hatred of a Favorite, nor the indignation
of a King; he respects me, he does every thing to please me.
He would have protected me when I was abandon'd by all
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:53808:243"/>
the world, nay, he has done more, for he has ruin'd himself
for my sake. What didst thou ever do like this? Thou wilt
tell me that thou lovest me; how! love me, and not show
common civility to me; thou who ought'st to have shewn
it to my Sex, altho' it was not due to my Quality. And yet
what ill-condition'd Master ever treated a Slave more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily
than thou hast treated me, and who would have
thus trampl'd on a person who loves thee so well as I do?
No, no, Prince, thou hast no reason to complain, and thou
art oblig'd to me that I don't. But I will go farther than
this: I will own, if thou wilt have me, Crimes that I never
committed. I will never see <hi>Hippolito</hi> more, nay I will be
ungrateful to him, that thou mayst not be so to me. In fine,
to regain thy Heart, there is nothing so difficult but I will
put it in execution. And there is nothing impossible to those
bright eyes, says the Prince to her, adjusting his Perriwig.
They have disarm'd me of all my anger, and provided they
always keep their favourable glances for me, the too happy
<hi>Prosper</hi> will never adore any one but the beautiful <hi>Mathilda.</hi>
The amorous Princess thought herself more than paid with
these few Compliments of her old Gallant. In a less publick
place perhaps she would have thrown herself at his Feet, to
thank him for this mighty condescension, but neither time
nor place would give her leave to answer him. The King
came out of his Chamber: She begg'd of <hi>Prosper</hi> to stand by
her when she spoke to him, but he shrinking away from her,
told her, that it was not convenient for them to be seen to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
for some reasons that he could tell her. She percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
well enough, that he was afraid of making his Court
ill, but she was so near the King, that she had not time to
reproach <hi>Prosper,</hi> with being a better Courtier than a Lover.
She presented herself to the King, paid her respects to him,
and made her compliment of thanks. The King receiv'd
her very coldly, and his answer was so ambiguous, that it
might be interpreted as well to her disadvantage as other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
But the sweet things that <hi>Prosper</hi> had said to her, gave
her such satisfaction, that his last ingratitude, in refusing to
introduce her to the King, made no impression upon her
mind, no more than the ill reception his Majesty gave her,
so much transported she was to be reconcil'd to her imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Lover. That day she was visited by all the Ladies of
Quality in <hi>Naples,</hi> who agreed to go a hunting the next
morning a Horseback, in a Campaign dress, and Caps set off
with Feathers. The greatest Gallants at Court were there,
so we may easily imagine, that the Prince of <hi>Salerno,</hi> who
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:53808:244"/>
was Gallantry it self, made one of the Company. This was
not all; he resolv'd to make the Princess a Present, which
he had never done before. He sent her a most passionate
Letter, attended with a fine Cap; but to tell the truth, he
himself sorted and order'd the Feathers, by the same token
that there was not one new Feather amongst them. As I
take it, I have already observ'd, that he had an admirable
fancy at Feathers. This was the only Vanity on which he
would lay out any Money, tho' to do him justice, he husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his Plumes to a miracle, for he would often diversify
them, transplanting them from one Cap to another, and as
old as they were, knew how to make them appear fresh and
new upon occasion, as well as if he had serv'd seven Years
Apprenticeship to the Trade. I am willing to believe that he
sat up the best part of the night to put it in order, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
might be wanting to so magnificent a Present. The
Princess receiv'd it as if it had been sent her from Heaven,
gave him a hundred more thanks than it deserv'd, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd
him in a Letter she sent in answer to his, that she
would honour herself with this miraculous Cap as long as
she liv'd. I will not tell you what sport they had in the
Chase, because the particulars never arriv'd to my knowledge.
But we may reasonably suppose, that some of their Horses
founder'd, that the Cavaliers were so well-bred as to wait
upon the Ladies, that <hi>Prosper</hi> display'd all his Gallantry, and
that he engross'd the whole talk to himself, being the greatest
Talker of his age. Our Ladies were so well pleas'd with
the Chase, that they resolv'd to take their pleasure the next
day; and in order to change their Diversion, they design'd
to go by Sea to <hi>Puzzolo,</hi> where the Princess <hi>Mathilda</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd
to give them a Collation and Musick. They no less
spruc'd themselves up for their Voyage by Water, than they
had done the day before for hunting. The Boats that carried
them were finely adorn'd, cover'd with rich Tapestry, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of <hi>Turky</hi> or <hi>China,</hi> I won't be positive, and the meanest
Cushions were of Silk or Velvet. <hi>Prosper</hi> would needs go
thither by land, and had none but his dear self to accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
him, either to save Money, or because he was melancholy,
for some folks are so out of pride. He was mounted upon
his finest Horse, had dress'd himself in his richest Campaign
Suit, and loaded his head with the spoils of many an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stridge.
<hi>Hippolito</hi>'s House lay in the road to <hi>Puzzolo,</hi> near
the Sea, and the Prince of <hi>Salerno</hi> must of necessity ride just
by it. He no sooner saw it, but a noble thought came into
his head. He knew that <hi>Hippolito</hi> was at home, and alighted
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:53808:244"/>
from his Horse to have a little Conversation with him. <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polito</hi>
receiv'd him with all the respect and civility that was
due to his Quality, altho' the other had not the manners to
return it. <hi>Prosper</hi> made him a very rude Compliment upon
his presuming to be in love with a Princess, who was to be his
Wife. <hi>Hippolito</hi> bore all his impertinence for a long while,
and answer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d him with all the sweetness imaginable, that he
ought not to be offended at his Gallantry, which a Love
without hopes put him upon. But at last <hi>Prosper</hi>'s Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
forc'd him to change his Language, and he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
call'd for his Horse to go out and fight him, when
word was brought him that the Sea was very tempestu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and that the Boats wherein the Ladies were, which
they could behold from the shore, were in danger of
being dash'd against the Rocks. <hi>Hippolito</hi> did not doubt but
that these Ladies were <hi>Mathilda</hi> and her Company, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
<hi>Prosper</hi> to run to the relief of their common Mistriss,
who excus'd himself upon his not being able to swim, and
that he was not yet recover'd of the bruise he receiv'd when
he run at the Ring. The generous <hi>Hippolito,</hi> detesting in his
Soul the ingratitude of his Rival, ran or rather flew to the
Sea-shore. His Servants follow'd him, threw themselves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Sea after his example, and by the assistance of some
Fishermen, who happen'd by good luck to be upon the
Coast, they made a shift to save <hi>Mathilda</hi>'s Life, and the
Ladies in her company. Their Boats were overturn'd within
a hundred Yards of the shore; and <hi>Naples</hi> had bewail'd the
loss of all its Beauties at once, if it had not been for this sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
relief. <hi>Hippolito</hi> was so happy, that <hi>Mathilda</hi> ow'd
her life to him. His love made him soon distinguish her
from the other Ladies, whom the waves were going to dash
against the rocks that bound the shore. While the Fisher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and his Servant help'd the first persons they found, he
caught hold of the Princess just as she rose above water, and
holding her with one hand, while he swum with the other
towards the shore, he happily gain'd it without any one to
help him. <hi>Mathilda</hi> found herself much more ill after her
Shipwrack, than the rest of the Ladies that were sav'd with
her. After they had vomited their salt-water, chang'd their
Cloaths and recover'd their fright, they were able that very
day to take Coach for <hi>Naples.</hi> As for the Princess of <hi>Taren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi>
it was a long time before they brought her to herself.
Even then they much doubted her Life, and <hi>Hippolito</hi> and
his Sister <hi>Ir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ne</hi> took all the care of her that was possible. He
sent to <hi>Naples</hi> for the ablest Physicians, besides him belonging
to the Princess, and quitted his House intirely to <hi>Mathilda,</hi>
                  <pb n="132" facs="tcp:53808:245"/>
and to some of her Domesticks that came to wait on her.
He and his Servants made a shift to lodge at a little Farm not
far from his own House, and sent every other moment to
enquire how the Princess did, when he could not go thither
himself. As for <hi>Prosper,</hi> very well pleas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d with the rough
Compliment he had pass'd upon <hi>Hippolito,</hi> he left <hi>Mathilda</hi>
and the rest of the Ladies to swim for themselves as well as
they could, without troubling his head what became of
them; thinking perhaps, that since he was none of the fittest
man to help them, he ought not to pollute his eyes with so
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> a spectacle, and so jogg'd on gently to <hi>Naples,</hi> expecting
the doubtful event of the Shipwrack, to rejoice at it or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
according as it would have made him happy or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy.
In the mean time <hi>Mathilda,</hi> assisted by her youth,
and the remedies that were given her, recover'd her Health
and Beauty all at once, and was extreamly satisfied with the
great care of <hi>Hippolito</hi> and his Sister, who dexterously insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to her, with what indifference <hi>Prosper</hi> had beheld the peril
she was in. <hi>Mathilda</hi> did not discover the least mark of
resentment in her face or discourse; whether it were because
her love master'd it, or because she dissembled her ill usage.
The Night before she design'd to leave <hi>Hippolito</hi>'s House and
return to <hi>Naples,</hi> she could not sleep, and call'd for a Book
and a Candle. Her Women were gone out of her Chamber
to sleep or do something, else, when she saw <hi>Prosper</hi> come into
the Room. We may readily guess what a surprize she was
in, to see him at so unseasonable an hour, and how much she
look'd upon herself affronted by so disrespectful a visit: She
spoke to him of it with some warmth. <hi>Prosper</hi> was warmer
than she, and as if this Princess had thrown herself into this
danger of losing her life, on purpose to give <hi>Hippolito</hi> the
glory of saving it, he reproach'd her with her Shipwrack, as
a blemish to her honour, and tax'd her with infidelity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
she was in the House of one that was in love with her,
lodg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d in his Chamber, and lay in his Bed. <hi>Mathilda</hi> wou'd
not condescend to shew him how unjust his reproaches were,
but retorted upon him for not having endeavour'd to save
her, and in a cutting way of raillery, complain'd of him for
not being able to swim, as also for not being fully recover'd
of his late dangerous fall. <hi>Prosper</hi> redden'd with anger and
confusion, treated her with opprobrious language, and told
her he would never see her any more, since <hi>Roger</hi> the King's
Favourite offer'd him his Sister, and with her all the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
he might expect from the alliance of a Man in his
Post. <hi>Mathilda</hi> could not hold out against so terrible a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace;
her Blood curdl'd within her, and her Love soon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:53808:245"/>
her Indignation. She had began to exert herself a little,
but all on the sudden became a suppliant. He relented too
on his side when he saw her humbl'd as much as he thought
convenient, and according to his custom cajol'd her, and
said the same soft things to her as he ought to have done, if
in all the love qurrrels he had had with her, he had never
trespass'd against the respect and tenderness he ow'd her. He
made new protestations of Love to her, and straining hard
to surprize her by some topping Compliments, he made very
impertinent ones, for he wish'd her all sorts of Adversities,
that he might have an opportunity forsooth of convincing
her, how much he was her humble Servant For God's sake Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
said he to her, in a passionate tone, why are you not
out of favour at Court? Oh that you were still persecuted
by <hi>Roger!</hi> Oh that you were yet out of your Principality of
<hi>Tarento!</hi> that you might see with what zeal and ardour I
would sollicite the King for you! with what vigour I would
espouse your cause against your Enemies, and whether I
should be afraid to venture my Person, and all that I am
worth in the world, to re-instate you in what was usurp'd
from you. Come, come, says the Princess, there's no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
that I should be more unfortunate than I am, to give
you the opportunity of shewing your generosity; and I
would not willingly put your Love to so dangerous a proof.
They were engag'd in this discourse, when a noise of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd
and dreadful voices, that cry'd out fire, made them
run to the windows, where they saw all the lower part of the
House under them, vomiting fire and smoke, and at the
same time the flames began to enter the Chamber by the Stair-case,
and took from them all hopes of saving themselves that
way, as <hi>Prosper</hi> was preparing to do. The Princess all in a
fright, conjur'd him not to abandon her in so great a danger,
and propos'd to him to make use of the Sheets and Hangings
to get out of the window. The Prince, as much affrighted
as she, told her, that they would not have time to do it;
and measuring with his eyes the height of the windows, and
considering which would be the best way to leap into the
Court, he told <hi>Mathilda</hi> very plainly, that upon these occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
every one ought to shift for himself. But thou shalt
not go without me, said she to him very resolutely, and I
will run no danger here, which the most ungrateful and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generous
Man alive shall not partake with me. She had no
sooner said these words, but she caught hold of <hi>Prosper,</hi> and
her indignation at his baseness gave her so much strength,
that in spite of all his striving and struggling, he could not
disengage himself from her. He swore, he call'd her names,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:53808:246"/>
he was Brute enough to threaten to drub or kill her, (I don't
know which of the two it was) and had certainly been as
good as his word, if at the time as he was tugging with her,
as rudely and fiercely as if he had been to deal with an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
the generous <hi>Hippolito</hi> had not come into the Room.
The Princess seeing him, left <hi>Prosper</hi> at liberty, and came up
to <hi>Hippolito,</hi> who without giving her time to speak to him,
cover'd her with a wet Sheet, which he had brought on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
and taking her in his Arms, he threw himself like a
Lion with his prey through the flames, which now fill'd all
the Stair-case. He had no sooner set her down in a place of
safety, but was so generous to do the same service for his Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val.
'Tis true, he burnt his Cloaths, sing'd his Hair and his
Eye-brows; but I would fain know what signifies the burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of ones Cloaths or the singing of ones Hair, to a Man
whose Heart was burnt to a coal by Love? While <hi>Mathilda</hi>
recover'd her Spirits, and <hi>Prosper</hi> got back to <hi>Naples,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
so much as thanking his Deliverer, the other beheld his
House burnt down to the ground, and with that his Furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and Horses, in short, all that his former profuseness
had left him: <hi>Mathilda</hi> was afflicted at it, I will not say
more than he was, for alas he scarce thought at all of it, but
as much as if she had seen all that she had dear in the world
destroy'd. She look'd upon herself to be the occasion of this
misfortune to him, and indeed she was not mistaken. Her
Cousin <hi>Roger,</hi> who had reconcil'd himself to her with no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
intention, but to accomplish her ruine more easie, had
brib'd some of <hi>Hippolito</hi>'s Servants, that were Villains enough
to take his Money, to lay a great deal of combustible stuff
in the Vaults and Cellars of his House, and set it on fire in
the dead of the night, when all the Family was asleep. This
unjust Favourite made no conscience to ruin a poor Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
nay, procure his death too, provided he could do the
same to a Relation, whose Estate he hop'd by this means to
inherit; and as if her death would not satisfie him, which
had most infallibly happen'd, in case his design had succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
he likewise endeavour'd to make her Memory odious.
At the time when <hi>Hippolito</hi>'s House was on fire, <hi>Roger</hi> had
manag'd his Cards so dexterously, that Messengers were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
to search <hi>Mathilda</hi>'s Palace, and opening her Closet
found some forg'd Letters there, which seem'd to be written
to the Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> and plainly convinc'd her of keeping
a private intelligence with that dangerous Enemy of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.
Our unfortunate Princess receiv'd this unlucky
News, just as she was going to send to <hi>Naples</hi> for her Coaches
to bring her home. She was extreamly troubled at it, and
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:53808:246"/>
without staying a moment longer, ran to <hi>Naples</hi> with all
her Servants a foot in the most lamentable condition that
can be imagin'd. <hi>Hippolito</hi> offer'd to accompany her, but
she positively forbid him, fearing I suppose to disoblige her
musty Spark <hi>Prosper;</hi> and thus our unhappy Lover saw her
depart, and was infinitely more concern'd at this last Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune
which had befal'n the Princess, and at her command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him to leave her, than at the burning of his House.
<hi>Mathilda</hi> no sooner came to <hi>Naples,</hi> but she was taken into
custody. She demanded to speak with the King, but it was
refus'd her. She sent to speak with <hi>Prosper,</hi> but the old
Gentleman pretended to be wondrous sick, and thus <hi>Mathil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi>
beheld herself all at once abandon'd by all her Friends, as
if she had been infected with the Plague. The very same
day she receiv'd an Order from the King to leave <hi>Naples.</hi>
Her own Domesticks basely and scandalously deserted her;
her Creditors, without any respect to her Quality, persecuted
her most unmercifully: In short, she was reduc'd to so
wretched a condition, that she could not procure Coach nor
Horse, to carry her to a certain Prince of <hi>Italy,</hi> who was
the nearest Relation she had in the world next to <hi>Roger,</hi>
and who had always espous'd her quarrel against that haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Favourite. Being thus forsaken by all her Friends, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute
even of the necessaries of Life, and uncapable of
obeying so rigorous an Order, she took sanctuary in a Convent,
where they would not receive her without his Majesty<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
for so doing, who granted it, upon condition that
she should leave it that very night. She went out of it in
disguise<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> and so secretly, that with all the search and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
<hi>Hippolito</hi> cou'd make, he could not meet the least in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
which way she was gone. However, he resolv'd
to follow her just as chance directed him, rather than sit
still at home, and make no enquiry after her. While he
was in quest of her, or at least fancied he was, she thought
no more of him, and <hi>Prosper</hi> thought no more of her. He
represented her as a Criminal of State, made his Court
very regularly to the King and his Favourite: and as the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality
of Mankind use to alter their Measures with the
time, he made love to <hi>Camilla, Roger</hi>'s Sister, and begg'd of
the King to help on the Marriage. The King, who look'd
upon it as an advantagious Match for the Sister of his Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
whom he lov'd the best of any Subject in his Dominions,
spoke about it to his Favourite, who always likes that which
his Master likes. This Sister of <hi>Roger</hi> was one of the most
beautiful Ladies of <hi>Naples,</hi> and tho' she shar'd in her Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
good Fortune, yet she had no hand in his wicked de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs.
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:53808:247"/>
As she was look'd upon at Court to be the best Match
in the Kingdom, she look'd upon <hi>Hippolito</hi> to be the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatest
Gentleman of his time, and perhaps lov'd him, or at
least would have lov'd him, if she had not beheld him so
passionately in love with another. She took <hi>Mathilda</hi>'s mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune
so to heart, and was so generous in her temper, that
if she had in the least suspected that it was all owing to her
Brother, she would most undoubtedly have reproach'd him
with so black an action, and been one of the first to exclaim
against it. She was so afflicted at <hi>Hippolito</hi>'s late loss, that
not valuing what the World would say of her, she went to
find him at his Habitation that was burnt down to the
ground, to offer him Money, or whatever he wanted that
lay in her power. She met with his Sister there, who little
expected such a visit, much less to be invited to take up her
Quarters at <hi>Camilla</hi>'s House. This beautiful Lady could not
refuse so obliging an offer, and went with her to <hi>Naples.</hi>
What better course could a young person of her Sex and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
take, who found herself without a Farthing to relieve
her, without a House to cover her, without hopes of mend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her Fortune, in a Country too, where she scarce knew
any one but her Brother, who was as good as lost to her,
since as soon as he was inform'd that <hi>Mathilda</hi> had left <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi>
he ran in quest of her like a Mad-man, without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
whether she was gone. That day on which <hi>Camilla</hi>
went to find <hi>Irene</hi> at her Brother<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s House, with a design to
carry her home with her, the King was pleas'd to honour
her with a visit, and presented to her our gallant Prince of
<hi>Salerno</hi> and all his Gallantry. <hi>Camilla,</hi> who had <hi>Hippolito</hi>
always in her thoughts, receiv'd <hi>Prosper</hi>'s Compliments
with as much indifference, as she express'd thankfulness to
the King for condescending to see her. The sorrowful <hi>Irene</hi>
bore her company, and under all her affliction appear'd so
charming to the eyes of the young King, that he fell in
love with her. His Love was violent in its very infancy.
He approached her with as much respect and awe, as if she
had been in his condition, and he in hers. He said a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
fine things to her upon her beauty, and this lovely
young Lady, who demean'd herself neither with too much
haugh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ness nor submission, discover'd at once so much wit,
prudence and modesty, that he consider'd her from that very
moment as the only happiness that was wanting to his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.
He stay'd at <hi>Camilla</hi>'s house as long as possible he
cou'd, and the pleasure he took in conversing with <hi>Irene,</hi>
was so much the more taken notice of, as the young King
had alw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ys seem'd insensible to love, and behaved himself
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:53808:247"/>
with great coldness towards all the most celebrated beauties
of <hi>Naples. Irene</hi> was so charming that it was impossible for
a man, tho never so little inclin'd to Love, and never so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable
to judge of her merit, to avoid falling in love with
her. <hi>Camilla</hi> before she knew her, intended to serve her for
her Brothers sake, but no sooner came she acquainted with
her, but she lov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d her for her own. She easily believ'd that
the King was in love with her, because she desir'd it, and
far from envying her good fortune, as any other handsom
Lady but herself wou'd have done, she rejoyc'd at it exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly.
She congratulated <hi>Irene</hi> upon so important a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest,
and had without question flatter'd the vanity and
hopes of any Lady less presuming than her. But this modest
Damosell cou'd not be perswaded, but that the King was
more a Gallant than a Lover, that he had no other design
but only to divert himself, and that he wou'd think no more
of her, when he was out of her sight. But she was mistaken:
it was not long before the King came again to her to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
her with his passion, which was so impetuous that it
wou'd not suffer him to be longer without seeing her than
that very evening after he fell in love with her. He told the
Prince of <hi>Salerno</hi> that he was resolv'd to go <hi>incognito</hi> after
the <hi>Spanish</hi> mode to make love to <hi>Irene</hi> under <hi>Camilla</hi>'s Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cony.
<hi>Prosper</hi> was mightily pleas'd to be made the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
of his Master's Pleasures, and accompany him in an
amorous Adventure. In all probability <hi>Roger</hi> had been cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
for this affair, or at least had bore his share in it, but
that very day he had taken his leave of the King to go to
<hi>Tarento,</hi> whither some important business call<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d him. The
Night came, and the King accompanied by <hi>Prosper,</hi> who
was armed like himself after the <hi>Italian</hi> manner, that is to
say, with more offensive Arms than a single man can be
suppos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d to want, came under <hi>Camilla</hi>'s Balcony, who had
been before hand acquainted with his coming by <hi>Prosper.</hi>
She knew the method and good breeding of the Court too
well, not to leave the King at liberty to entertain himself
with his Mistriss in private. For this reason she retir'd to
another Balcony, notwithstanding all the intreaties of <hi>Irene</hi>
to stay with her. The King reproach'd this young Lady for
her uneasiness to be alone with him, and told her, that she
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ow'd at least some complaisance to a King, who had for her
something above it. I should owe all to your Majesty, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
<hi>Irene,</hi> if I did not likewise owe something to my self,
which I cannot owe to any one else. And what do you owe
to your self, says the King, which you do not owe to my
Love? Why not to believe that you have any for me,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:53808:248"/>
answers <hi>Irene.</hi> Alas! cries the King sighing, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
so sure, and there is nothing I would not willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
do to hinder you from doubting it. If I could be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
what you tell me, says she, I should have more
reason to complain of your Majesty, than thank you for
it. How cruel Damosel, answer'd the King, and can a
passion so sincere as mine offend you. It wou'd be a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to some great Queen, replies <hi>Irene,</hi> but it wou'd very
much call in question the Judgment of any one else. 'Tis
true indeed, says the King, that you are no Queen, but she
that deserves to be one, is in a possibility of making one. I
am not so vain of my own merit, answers <hi>Irene,</hi> as to expect
any such alteration in my fortune, and your Majesty has
more goodness, than to divert yourself longer at the expence
of an unhappy Creature. Beautiful <hi>Irene,</hi> says our amorous
Prince, I love you as much as 'tis possible for the most passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
and faithful Lover in the Universe to love you, and if
my Tongue has inform'd you of what my looks and sighs
cou'd not have acquainted you with in so short a time, don't
think that I have any design to dispense by my quality any
of the pains of a long servitude, or any of the services and
cares which the most charming woman upon earth may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
from the most respectful Lover. But so violent a pain
as mine wants a speedy remedy, and you ought to be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
in my opinion, however scrupulous and rigid you may
be towards a King, who is afraid to displease you, with this
declaration of my Love. He said to her abundance of things
more passionate than this, which the person who overheard
them unluckily forgot, as I can assure you he did. So I
leave the discreet Reader to imagin them within himself;
for to make a King of <hi>Naples</hi> express himself so tenderly as
ours did, and at the same time not to maim his thoughts, a
man must be as much in love as he was, which I humbly
presume is none of my business at present. <hi>Irene</hi> always an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd
him with her usual modesty, and without shewing
herself too hard, or too easie to be perswaded, she disengag'd
herself so handsomely from so nice a Conversation, that it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd
the King's esteem for her, who parted from her infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
more in love than he had been before. From that
time there passed not a day over his head, in which he did
not visit <hi>Camilla</hi> and <hi>Irene,</hi> nor a night but he came to that
Lady's Balcony, where he employ'd all his amorous elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
to perswade her of the sincerity of his Passion. One
night that he had given orders to his Guards not to attend
him, he walked in a disguise through the Streets of <hi>Naples,</hi>
accompanied only by the Prince of <hi>Salerno,</hi> and found so
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:53808:248"/>
much diversion in this Ramble, that the greatest part of the
night was spent when he came to <hi>Camilla</hi>'s Balcony. He
found this Post already taken up by two Men, or at least
they stood so near it, that they must needs have overheard
every word of the Conversation he hop'd to have with <hi>Irene.</hi>
One of these Men parted from the other and went into <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milla</hi>'s
House, and his Companion tarried in the Street. The
King stay'd a while to see whether he would not go away of
himself, and leave him the Street free; but finding that he
stirr'd no more from the place than a Statue, he grew impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient,
and commanded <hi>Prosper</hi> to go and see what the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
meant by staying there, and oblige him to retire. The
Prince of <hi>Salerno</hi> walked toward him, with as much diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
as if he had been sent upon some dangerous exploit,
and the other seeing him come up retired from him. <hi>Prosper</hi>
was resolv'd to see who he was, the other mended his pace,
and seeing that <hi>Prosper</hi> did the same, he very fairly betook
himself to his Heels, and the Prince of <hi>Salerno</hi> ran after him,
and cours'd him into another Street. In the mean time the
King did not stir from his place, expecting every moment
when <hi>Prosper</hi> would come back, that he might send him to
<hi>Camilla</hi> and <hi>Irene,</hi> to let them know that he expected them
under her Balcony, and in all probability he was wholly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
up with his Amour, for a Lover does nothing else when
he is alone, when the Man who had parted from him whom
<hi>Prosper</hi> pursu'd came out of <hi>Camilla</hi>'s House, and mistaking
the King for his Comrade: Look <hi>Calixtus,</hi> said he to him,
here is your dispatch. The Governour of <hi>Cajetta</hi> will order
you a Vessel to carry you to <hi>Marseilles.</hi> The King without

with a remorse for his crime, was for a long time forc'd
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:53808:249"/>
to defend himself. At last, his rage filling him with new
strength and courage, he push'd furiously at the King,
whom he look'd upon now to be no otherwise than his
enemy; and by the desperate thrusts he made at his sacred
person, oblig'd him likewise to defend himself. But Kings,
who may be valiant as well as other men, are usually as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
by a more powerful genius than that of ordinary
mortals. <hi>Roger,</hi> as brave and furious and desperate as he
was, cou'd not have maintain'd his ground long against his
incens'd Prince, altho the clashing of Swords had not
brought several persons upon the spot, who could hardly
be kept from hacking to pieces an execrable Villain,
who durst attack the Life of his Soveraign. His own
Domestics, and those of <hi>Camilla</hi> were the first that
came with lights into the Street, and were strangely
surprized to see their Master engaged with the King.
The unfortunate <hi>Roger</hi> no sooner saw the light which
exposed him to the terrible looks of his Prince, but he
was utterly confounded. His rage and his valour aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned
him both at once, and his Sword dropt out of his
hand. The King, who had the pleasure to see him wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
after he had had occasion for all his valour to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
himself from being wounded by him, seized him with
his own hands, and gave him to the Captain of his Guards,
who came luckily by with a party of Soldiers, and had
receiv'd orders to watch all night long the avenues leading
to <hi>Camilla</hi>'s House. In the mean time <hi>Prosper</hi> ran after
his men, who, flying from him as fast as his legs wou'd car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
him, unluckily fell into the hands of the Watch, who
were walking their rounds that night, as their custom was
to prevent all disorders in the streets. He seem'd so asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisht,
and falter'd so strangely in his answers, that they
had certainly stopt him, altho <hi>Prosper,</hi> who pursued with
Sword in hand, and had made himself known unto them
had not commanded them in the Kings name to secure him
and to be answerable for his forth coming. He immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
sent back to acquaint the King with what he had done
and if he was surpriz'd to see such a number of Flambeaux i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

he was much more so to find what had past between

distinguish'd her from her Brother, whose crime should not
in the least lessen his esteem for her. <hi>Irene</hi> writ to him in
favour of <hi>Roger;</hi> and to oblige <hi>Camilla,</hi> did that which
the repeated instances of an amorous Prince could not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
from her. The next day <hi>Roger</hi> was examin'd, and
found guilty of High Treason, for maintaining a private
correspondence with the Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> who had a great
party still in the Kingdom of <hi>Naples.</hi> He had been inform'd
by some of them of the insatiable ambition of <hi>Roger,</hi> and
having offer'd to him in Marriage a Princess of his own
blood, with certain advantages, which he cou'd not hope
from his present Master, this ungrateful Favourite, violating
his Faith and Honour, had engag'd to receive the <hi>French</hi> in
<hi>Cajetta</hi> and <hi>Castellamara,</hi> whereof he was Governour. The
same Judges who convicted him of Treason against his
Prince, discovered his villainous Plot against the Princess of
<hi>Tarento;</hi> and now that mirrour of Constancy the Prince of
<hi>Salerno,</hi> who had abandon'd her when he saw her in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace,
to offer his services to <hi>Camilla,</hi> whom he saw in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
no sooner did he find the King repent of the ill treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
he had given her, and resolv'd to re-instate her in her
former honour and fortune, which had been unjustly taken
away from her, but likewise to confer new ones upon her,
but this generous Lord, who had so lately importun'd the
King to marry him to <hi>Camilla,</hi> now humbly entreated him
to dispense with his promise, and give him leave to carry on
his pretensions to <hi>Mathilda,</hi> and desir'd his Majesty, who
design'd to make enquiry after her, to leave the care of that
to him, and give him a Commission to go and find her
where-ever he cou'd hear any news of her, in order to bring
her again to Court. The Kings affection was too deeply set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled
upon the beautiful <hi>Irene,</hi> not to think of her Brother
<hi>Hippolito,</hi> and be concern'd that no body cou'd tell where he
was. He dispatche Courriers into all parts of <hi>Italy,</hi> who had
orders to enquire after him as they searched for <hi>Mathilda,</hi>
and in case they found him, to bring him to <hi>Naples.</hi> He
hoped by this means to convince <hi>Irene,</hi> how cordially he
espous'd the interests of her family, and how much it
afficted him, that she knew not what was become of her
Brother, whom she lov'd so dearly. This amorous Cavalier,
after he had searched a long time for his Princess with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
care and diligence, without being able to find her, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd
himself to that blind guide chance, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

his Horse carried him, making no longer a stay in any

suppose were not so sollicitous in the search of <hi>Mathilda,</hi> had
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:53808:250"/>
time to rest themselves. As for him, he enjoy'd no more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
than a condemn'd Criminal, and after he had pass'd
whole days in sighing on Horseback, he spent whole nights
in complaining to the Trees and Rocks of the cruelty and
absence of <hi>Mathilda,</hi> and quarrelling with the innocent
Stars, that generally lighted him to Bed, because he lay in
the open Fields, and under the Canopy of Heaven. One
day, when he was so taken up with his melancholy thoughts,
that he did not consider that his Servant and his Horses
cou'd not like himself, feed upon so slender a Diet as Love, he
found himself towards Sun-setting near a solitary Inn,
which rather look'd like a retreat for Cut-throats and Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditti,
than a place to lodge Travellers. <hi>Hippolito</hi> rode be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
it, for your true Lover is an indefatigable Animal,
when his Valet inform'd him, that his Horses were not able
to jog on a step further, for meer lassitude and hunger, not
to talk of himself, who wanted to eat and repose himself as
well as they; upon this our despairing Lover condescended
to alight, but the Inn-keeper, who stood before his Gate,
with his Wife and an ill-look'd fellow, who seem'd to be a
Soldier, told him rudely, that he had no place to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
him in, and that his Rooms as well as his Stables were
all taken up. <hi>Hippolito</hi> was not much concern'd that he
cou'd not get a lodging here, and his Servant despair'd of
getting one, when the Soldier that stood by the Inn-keeper,
after he had whisper'd a few words in his ear, told <hi>Hippolito</hi>
in <hi>Calabrian,</hi> that if he pleas'd he might come in, and that
he should be very proud to lend his room to so fine a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,
and while <hi>Hippolito</hi> made a scruple to accept so cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
an offer, the Man of the House, that spoke so rudely
to him a little before, came and held his Stirrup, while he
alighted, with a smiling cut-throat look, which shew'd he
design'd to make a penny of him. Thus <hi>Hippolito</hi> was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
to come into the Inn. He would not eat a bit, and
having only drank a Glass of Water, (for Philosophers
have observ'd that Love and Sorrow are very dry) he walk'd
out to take a turn or two, in a place very proper to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
his melancholy Contemplations, which he had observ'd,
not far from the Inn. In the mean time his Valet sat down
to supper with the Landlord and his Wife, and the civil <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labrian,</hi>
who had so obligingly parted with his Chamber to
<hi>Hippolito.</hi> He fell on like a man that was half starv'd,
and did not guzzle down so much Wine as he cou'd have done,
because he was forc'd to call upon his Master to put him in
mind of going to bed, which was a thing he frequently for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got.
He went to find him among the Rocks, where he found
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:53808:250"/>
him feeding his Melancholy, by reflecting upon the ill condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his affairs and his Love, and brought him back to the
Inn, where they shew'd a vile Room, with a Bed more vile
than that, and which having no Curtains, lay expos'd to the
Sun and Wind on all sides. <hi>Hippolito</hi> would not undress, but
threw himself with his Cloaths upon the Bed, and his Man up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
another, where he slept so heartily, that it would have
made any man but his Master envy him, who for his part
could not sleep a wink; but a true Lover would think he had
committed an unpardonable sin, should he sleep like other
Mortals. In a short time all the people in the Inn were got to
bed, and every thing was hush'd, when some persons on Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back
disturb'd their repose, and thunder'd at the Gate, like
Men that were impatient to be let in. The Man of the House,
that got up to see what the matter was, knew them, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd
the Gate to them. Soon after <hi>Hippolito</hi> heard the next
Chamber to his open; several persons went into it, and some
of them went out again immediately, while the rest that stay'd
talk'd to one another. He was too much taken up with his
own private affairs, to have any great curiosity for those of
other people, and he had not listen'd to their discourse, if one
of them had not talked so loud, that he fancied he was not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted
with the voice. This made him desirous to know
what they talk'd of, and at last he heard them speak the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
words distinctly. Yes, my dear <hi>Iulia,</hi> I must once more
say it, few persons of my condition have been treated worse by
Fortune than my self, she has plung'd me in miseries that are
not to be parallel'd: But as great and vexatious as they are,
they don't so much disturb me as the ingratitude wherewith
the basest of men requites my affection for him; and this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude
does not sit so heavy on me, as mine to the man
whom I ought to love. I blame myself incessantly for it, and
my inquietude on this score is infinitely more afflicting to me,
than all the losses I have sustain'd, and all the calamities that
oppress me. The other person that took up the discourse talk'd
so low, that <hi>Hippolito</hi> could hear nothing but a few incoherent
words, that were frequently interrupted by sighs. He got up
and crept to the Wainscot which divided the two Rooms, but
the noise he made was heard by the persons whom he had a
mind to listen to, so their Conversation ceas'd, but not the
sighs of the afflicted party, whose voice he imagin'd to resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
that of <hi>Mathilda.</hi> The Reader may easily guess how im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient
he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>as to know whether he was mistaken, and to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
himself in so important a doubt, he was preparing to go
out of his Chamber, when all on the sudden the door open'd,
and by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ght of a dark Lanthorn, he saw four Men come
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:53808:251"/>
into the Room with their Swords in their hands, among whom
he observ'd the <hi>Calabrian</hi> Soldier and the Master of the House.
If he was surpriz'd at so unseasonable a visit from these men,
who did not seem to come with any good design, they were
no less so to find him up and awake, who they hoped was in
a sound sleep. <hi>Hippolito</hi> clapping his hand to his Sword, ask'd
them what they wanted in his Chamber at such an hour and
in such an equipage; and he no sooner saw them put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in a posture to attack him, but he fell upon the first
with such bravery and skill, that he soon made the Room too
hot for 'em. In the mean time his Footman awak'd, follow'd
the noise, and seeing his Master set upon by so many Enemies,
seconded him very valiantly at that instant, when having
wounded all those that had attack'd him, he had laid the
most dangerous of them at his feet. These Men defended
themselves like Fellows that did not value their lives; but
tho they had been more in number than really they were,
yet they could not have resisted the valiant <hi>Hippolito,</hi> second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by so courageous a Servant. He kill'd another of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and the two that were left very fairly betook themselves
to their heels. He was so vex'd at a slight wound he receiv'd
in his own arm, that he was resolv'd to pursue them, and in all
probability had clear'd the World of them, as well as he had
done of the other Sparks, if these Villains had not been so wise
in their fear, as to make one leap of it down the Stair-case,
and shut the door after them. <hi>Hippolito</hi> was a long while be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he could open it, which gave the two Murderers time
enough make their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

to the Inn without them. He ran directly to the Chamber,
where he thought he had heard <hi>Mathilda</hi>'s voice, but found
it open and no one in it, no more than in the rest of the rooms
in the House, which he search'd with as much care as inquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
<hi>Fulvio,</hi> said he to his Man, I heard <hi>Mathilda</hi> talk, I knew
her voice, and no one but such an unhappy wretch as I am,
could have mist her when she was so near him. He afterwards
repeated to <hi>Fulvio</hi> the words he heard <hi>Mathilda</hi> speak, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted
them to his advantage, as he had some reason to do,
but instead of giving him consolation, they only <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="4 letters">

<pb n="145" facs="tcp:53808:251"/>
                  <hi>Hippolito</hi> quitted this Inn in the most pensive Condition that
can be imagin'd. <hi>Fulvio</hi> propos'd to carry off the Theives Horses,
as being lawfull Prize, and represented to him, that perhaps
they might find <hi>Mathilda,</hi> and then they should want a Steed
to mount her on. <hi>Hippolito</hi> did not hear what he said, or else
would not vouchsafe to make him an Answer, so strangely
was he taken up with his Melancholy Thoughts. <hi>Fulvio</hi> took
his Masters silence for consent, and tying the Horses by the
Tail, drove them before him, designing, I suppose, to make
ready Money of them, the first Chapman he could find, They
rode part of the Day together, without <hi>Hippolito</hi>'s answering
so much as one of the many Questions <hi>Fulvio</hi> put to him, in
order to divert him: They lost their way, and at last
were got among a parcel of barren Rocks by the Sea-side
that was hard by, and ended in a sandy Plain. Among
these Rocks, in a Creek where the Sea run into the Land,
as they came from a narrow Lane, they fell upon a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of Peasants, arm'd with all sorts of Clubs and Weapons,
who where at first surpriz'd to see two Men on Horseback,
followed with so many Horses without any to ride them;
but taking Heart of Grace to see so few, and themselves
so many, for there was at least a Hundred of them got
together, they encompassed them in a tumultous manner, and
held the butt ends of their Muskets against them; some
cry'd out, <hi>Who goes there?</hi> Others, <hi>Who are you for?</hi> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
<hi>Knock them down,</hi> and lastly, some more Conscientious,
<hi>Who are ye? Hippolito</hi> could not answer so many Questions
at once, and these ill-bred Clowns made such a confounded
noise that there was no hearing of him. At last an old
Man of a tolerable good aspect, who afterwards discover'd
that he commanded these formidable Hero's (for then every
Man set up for himself) partly by speaking out a loud
to them, which set him a coughing like an Alderman at
Church, and partly by the Rhetorick of a good Oaken
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>dgel, made a shift to compose the mutiny. He asked
<hi>Hippolito</hi> peaceably and civilly who he was, and what bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness
he had in so Solitary a place, so remote from the great
Road. <hi>Hippolito</hi> told him that he was a Cavalier of <hi>Naples,</hi>
and that he had lost his way to <hi>Ancona.</hi> He then asked
the old Spark what business brought so many People toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
who inform'd him that some Corsairs of <hi>Barbary</hi> had

higher into the Country. He added, that most of these Men
whom he saw Arm'd, were Robb'd, and that they resolv'd
under his Conduct to wait the coming of the Enemy, and
fight them as they came back with their Slaves and the
Plunder of a Neighbouring Village, which in all probability
they were gone to Attack; that 'twas impossible for the
<hi>Moors</hi> to escape them, there being no other way for them
to get back to the Sea again but this, and that it was
not so much the loss of their Goods that had encouraged
these Peasants to attempt so bold a design, as that of their
Wives and Children. <hi>Hippolito</hi> offer'd to venture his Life
in their Quarrel, and they took him at his Word. The
old Man gave him the Command of them, which he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted,
to the great Satisfaction and Joy of our Boors, who
promis'd themselves mighty matters from <hi>Hippolito</hi>'s Military
Phiz. Four of the likeliest among them, of which the old
Fellow was one, were mounted upon the four Horses, which
the provident <hi>Fulvio</hi> had brought with him from the Inn.
<hi>Hippolito</hi> divided his Men into three Parties. He posted one
among the Rocks, where they cou'd not be seen by the
Enemy, with orders not to fight them before they came up
to them. He posted the second in a narrow Passage that led
towards the Sea, to hinder the Infidels from getting back
to their Ships, and he placed himself with his Men on Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back
at the Head of the third, encouraging them to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have
themselves bravely, and fall in with the Enemy to
make their Arrows uneffectual. He had scarce given these
Orders, and Posted his Men, when the Enemy appear'd to
the number of a Hundred and Fifty Men. They drove se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Horses before their Main-Body laden with Booty, and
the Women and Children they had made their Slaves. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
old experienc'd Soldiers, they were not at all discourag'd
to see <hi>Hippolito</hi> and his Troop march towards them, or
perhaps they despised so small a number. I will not trouble
my self to set down the particulars of this noble Battle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the <hi>Moorish</hi> Corsairs and our Peasants, altho' <hi>Hippoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi>
did abundance of Gallant Actions there, which deserve
to be remembred. I will only tell you that his Orders were
well Executed, that the Arrows of the <hi>Moors</hi> did them lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
or no harm, because they fell in with them so Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Men. Our Peasants when they were once blooded put
all the <hi>Moors</hi> to the Sword, whether they cry'd out

                  </gap>ed
as much as the common Joy would give them leave, and
the Wounded bound up their Wounds. <hi>Hippolito</hi> received
a thousand Commendations, and as many Thanks from these
poor People, who believed they should not have got the
better if it had not been for him. They offered him the
best part of the Booty they recover'd from the Enemy, which
be refus'd, as likewise to go and make Merry with them
after the Victory, when <hi>Fulvio</hi> brought two Women before
him in the Habit of Pilgrims, one of whom had no sooner
taken off a great Hat which hid her Face, but he knew
her to be <hi>Mathilda.</hi> He alighted, or rather he leapt from
his Horse, to throw himself at the Feet of this Princess,
who embrac'd him with all the marks of Tenderness that
shew'd nothing of that disobliging Treatment, which the
Tyranny of the Prince of <hi>Salerno</hi> had oblig'd her former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to shew to <hi>Hippolito.</hi> This faithful Lover wanted Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
to tell <hi>Mathilda</hi> how glad he was to see her,
never did his Eloquence leave him so in the lurch; never
did he so strain to declare his Thoughts, and at the same
time Murder them. In short he did not know what he did,
so great was the disorder of his Mind. He was uncertain
for some time whether he should inform <hi>Mathilda</hi> of the
pains he had been at to find her, so much did his exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
Modesty keep him from valuing himself upon his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices.
However he gave her at last a true recital of his
Adventures, ever since he had left <hi>Naples</hi> for her sake, and
forgot not to acquaint her with what happened to him
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n the Inn, where as he fancied, he had heard her Voice.
<hi>Mathilda</hi> gave him abundance of Thanks for these last Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations
she had to him, adding that she looked upon her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to owe both her Life and Honour to him, since the
defeat of the <hi>Moors</hi> was entirely owing to his Bravery and
Conduct. She own'd to him that it was she who was in
the next Chamber to him at the Inn, promised to inform
him by what accident she was carried thither, and in short
to give him her whole History, when she had a convenient
time and place. The other Pilgrim that accompanied <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thilda</hi>
was one of her Chamber-Maids called <hi>Iulia,</hi> who
was the only Servant that had Fidelity enough to follow
the same Fortune with her Mistriss, and bear a part in all
her Afflictions. 'Tis very probable that <hi>Fulvio</hi> and she were
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>lad to see one another; and for my part, I am apt to
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:53808:255"/>
believe that they said abundance of fine things, and displayed
their Subaltern Eloquence (if I may so express my self)
very plentifully upon this occasion. Our Victorious Peasants
that observ'd with what concern <hi>Hippolito</hi> and <hi>Mathilda</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
one another, redoubled their courteous offers to <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polito,</hi>
who made no difficulty to accept them for the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess's
sake. Among the rest the old Man, who as I have
already taken notice, led the Peasants on to Battel, before <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polito</hi>
came to them, begg'd of him and <hi>Mathilda</hi> that they
would do him the Honour to take a sorry Lodging at his
House, which they accepted. He sent one of his Sons in
all haste to get all things ready at Home for the better
reception of his Guests, and now they prepared for their
Journey. <hi>Mathilda</hi> and <hi>Iulia</hi> were mouuted upon the two
best Horses they could find. Among several Women, whom
they freed out of the Hands of the <hi>Moors, Fulvio</hi> observ'd
one, whom he thought he had seen somewhere, who avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as much as she could his looking at her, as if she knew
him, but had no mind to be known by him. At last
he came up to her, and found her to be the Inn-kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per's
Wife that design'd to Murder them. He went to
inform his Master of it, and desired some Peasants to look
after her. Towards the dusk of the Evening they arriv'd
at the Village: <hi>Mathilda</hi> and <hi>Hippolito</hi> were receiv'd by our
old Man with all the Marks of Esteem and Gratitude.
The other Peasants of the Village went home to their
own Houses, to make Merry after so notable a Victory,
and those that lived farther off, march'd home-wards likewise.

made <hi>Fulvio</hi> and <hi>Iulia,</hi> the old Man and his whole Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
to Sup with them. After Supper (I cannot tell whether
it was a good or a bad one) <hi>Mathilda</hi> wou'd not suffer
<hi>Hippolito</hi> to languish any longer under his Impatience to
know her Adventures, and inform'd him by what Accident
she came to the Inn, and afterwards into the Hands of the
<hi>Moors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After the King had commanded me, <hi>said she, to him,</hi> to
quit <hi>Naples,</hi> and by the great Interest of my Enemies, I had
but one Night allow'd me to put my self in a Condition to
obey so rigorous an Order; I implor'd the Assistance of some
Gentlemen at Court, whom I thought I had obliged enough to
be my Friends, but I found to my disappointment, that they were
only Friends to my Fortune, and not to me. I had more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to complain of my Domesticks, who all abandon'd me in this
Extremity but <hi>Julia.</hi> She had a Brother Married in <hi>Naples,</hi>
who had the Generosity to leave his Family at the entreaty of
his Sister, and to Conduct me to the Place where I design'd to
Steer my Course. He bestirred himself so effectually, that the
very Night I was commanded to leave <hi>Naples,</hi> I got every thing
ready for my Iourney, before break of Day. We drest our selves
in the Habit of <hi>Loretto</hi>-Pilgrims, by which means we were not
discover'd at the City Gates. I Walked that Day as many Miles
as could be expected from one of my Sex, who had never been
used to Travel before, and we jogg'd on peaceably several Days,
without any cross Adventures to disturb us. Yesterday a little
before Night, we were met in a narrow Way by three Men on
Horseback, that had the Looks of Villains. I design'd to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
them, and did it in so much baste, and so unluckily, that
my Foot slipt against a piece of rising Ground in the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
and so I fell at the Foot of one of the Horses that came
thundering after me. My large Hat which cover'd my Face,
and my Head cloaths tumbled off with the Fall, and my Hair
fell about my Shoulders. My ill Stars would so have it, that
these Men saw something in me that did not displease them.
They talk'd a while together, then alighted from their Horses,
one of them seized <hi>Julia,</hi> another caught hold of me, while the
third attack'd <hi>Julia</hi>'s Brother, who put himself in a Posture to
Defend us, and whom we saw fall soon after, being r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n through
the Body. After so many Misfortunes which had happen'd to
me, and which from a happy Princess, at least so in appearance,
made me the most miserable Woman in the World, I had some
reason to believe, that all the Prudence and all the Precaution
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:53808:256"/>
imaginable, signifie nothing against Fortune, that we must e'en let
her Act as she pleases, and persuade our selves, that her Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy
which makes us feel her Hatred, then, when we thought
our selves the most secure from it, will restore us likewise to her
Friendship, when we least expect it. Thus I resign'd my self,
<hi>continues</hi> Mathilda, to my private Destiny, and when I found
my self stopt and seiz'd by these Strangers, I submitted my self
without any struggling, to be mounted upon one of their Horses,
because I knew they could otherwise have done it by main Force,
and altho' I was in their Hands, yet Death could deliver me
from them, when ever their Insolence should oblige me to have
recourse to this last Remedy. <hi>Julia,</hi> who fell a screaming and
crying out as loud as she was able, when she saw her Brother
drop, suffer'd her self to be carried off after my Example, but
still continued afflicted. At Night we arriv'd at the Inn, where
you heard my Voice. Your Engagement with the Robbers trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
us exceedingly at first, but when you had driven them out
of the House, and the noise was over, <hi>Julia</hi> and I quitted our
Room. Finding no Body in the Inn, we resolv'd to make our
escapes out at the Garden-door, which stood open, and the fear
of being re-taken, made us double our speed. We walked all
Night and part of the next Day, till the heat of the Sun, and our
Weariness together, forc'd us to rest our selves among the Rocks,
not far from this Place, where we found a convenient Shade,
and were taken asleep by the <hi>Moors,</hi> whom you defeated.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Matilda</hi> concluded the recital of her Adventures, with
making fresh Protestations to <hi>Hippolito,</hi> that she wou'd never
forget what he had done for her. However she did not tell
him the Name of the Place where she intended to retire,
and for his part, he did not ask her to do it, No doubt
on't, but it was to one puny Prince or other in <hi>Italy,</hi> in
which Cattel that Country abounds, for any Man that has
Money enough, may be made a Highness, without any other
Qualification. I might easily have bestowed what Name I pleas'd
upon him, since History has been silent in the matter, but I found
upon second Thoughts, that his Name would be no great Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to the Narration. <hi>Hippolito</hi> offer'd to Conduct her
whither she had a design to go, but she would by no means
suffer it, however she was forced at the repeated Instances o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Hippolito</hi> to the sad Ruines of his House, where he arriv'd
without a Farthing in his Pocket, and all the Earthly Goods
he had in this transitory World, was the Horse he rode
upon. He had scarce set Foot to Ground, when he met with
a <hi>Neapolitan</hi> Gentleman, who was in quest of <hi>Mathilda,</hi> as
well as several more, whom the King dispatch'd to all Parts
of <hi>Italy</hi> to find her out, and went just as Chance directed
him. He acquainted <hi>Hippolito</hi> with <hi>Roger</hi>'s Disgrace, after
what manner <hi>Mathilda</hi>'s Innocence came to be discovered,
the Orders the King had given to find her if possible, in
short, with all that had happen'd at <hi>Naples</hi> ever since he
had left it, except his Majesty's violent Love of the Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
<hi>Irene,</hi> which was known to all the World; however
our Gentleman conceal'd it from him, whether out of an
excess of Discretion, or for some other Reason which I don't
know. You may imagine, that <hi>Hippolito,</hi> Generous as he
was, and loving <hi>Mathilda</hi> better than himself, was extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
pleas'd to hear of so unexpected a Revolution in her For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
altho' at the same time, he came to know that his
own Condition was more desperate than ever. This Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
assuring him, that the King had promised <hi>Prosper,</hi>
that he should Marry this Princess, as soon as she returned
to <hi>Naples.</hi> This last News hinder'd the wretched <hi>Hippolito</hi>
from going to Court, it made his Life odious to him, and
he avoided all manner of Company so carefully, that he was
the only Man in the Kingdom, who knew not what a great
Ascendant his Sister had over the King. In the mean time
<hi>Mathilda</hi> was no where to be heard of, altho' the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
that had accidentally met with <hi>Hippolito,</hi> went to <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cona,</hi>
whither he told him she was gone, yet he could hear
no News of her, notwithstanding all the enquiry he made
to that purpose. A Report ran of this Princesses Death,
and some People pretended to relate the very Circumstances
of it, at last it came to <hi>Hippolito</hi>'s Ears, and threw him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a fit of Sickness, which had like to have cost him his
Life. But in short, his Body recovered a little Strength, in
spite of the Indisposition of his Mind. He sometimes rode
on Horse-back along the Sea-shore, and 'twas in one of
these Melancholy Freaks, that after he had made several
Reflections upon the Misfortunes of his Life, he resolved to
go and end his Days in the War which the <hi>Grecian</hi> Princes
were at that time carrying on against the <hi>Turk,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to extend his Conquests from <hi>Asia</hi> into <hi>Europe.</hi> At last
<hi>Mathilda</hi> was found, and <hi>Hippolito</hi> was so ravished with
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:53808:257"/>
Joy, that he bestowed his Horse, the only Moveable he had
left him in the World, upon the Man that brought him
the News. The same Day his Servant <hi>Fulvio</hi> came to him,
and was exceedingly astonished to find his Master so Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy,
and in so bad an Equipage, at a time when all <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly</hi>
talked of nothing but the great Power his Sister <hi>Irene</hi>
had over the King, and the Love he had for her. He told
<hi>Hippolito</hi> the Princes's Name, where <hi>Mathilda</hi> retired, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
him in what manner <hi>Prosper</hi> came to Compliment
her from the King, and Conduct her to <hi>Naples,</hi> and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the laudable Custom of Servants, that always make
hast to tell their Masters ill News, he exaggerated to him
the joy <hi>Mathilda</hi> had discovered when she saw <hi>Prosper,</hi> and
the Marks of Affection she shew'd him. <hi>Her Passion for him
is so increased,</hi> continues this indiscreet Valet, <hi>that she has
newly spruc'd up the old Cap of Plumes, with which</hi> Prosper
<hi>formerly presented her, which he has so often upraided her with,
and which is so well known at</hi> Naples, <hi>by the many Iests that have
been made on it at Court. I can't imagine,</hi> says he, <hi>where the
Devil she had laid it up, to find it at so so critical a Iun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,
but to be sure she must set a mighty value on it.</hi> After
this rare trusty <hi>Fulvio</hi> began to rail at the Princess of <hi>Tarento</hi> a
little more than became him; but <hi>Hippolito</hi> bid him hold
his Tongue, and perhaps had Cudgel'd him, if he had not
given off, or alter'd his Language. <hi>Fulvio</hi> likewise told his
Master, that the Princess desired him to come and meet her.
How! cries <hi>Hippolito,</hi> and does she not sufficiently afflict me
by not loving me, but to enhance my Affliction, must she
make me see how well she loves another, and will she Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ress
<hi>Prosper</hi> before me? To give him I suppose the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
to see me die of Grief, as if their Happiness wanted
nothing to compleat it but my Death. But, continues <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o,</hi>
I must obey her, and see how far her Injustice will
go. He was in a good Vein to complain of his ill Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and perhaps had effectually done it, as he had just
provocation, when he saw afar off a Body of Horse, which
<hi>Fulvio</hi> assured him, came with the Princess of <hi>Tarento,</hi> who
designing to see <hi>Hippolito,</hi> wou'd needs pass by his House,
in hopes to find him there. Altho' the King had sent his
Coaches for her, yet she was resolv'd to make her Entry
into <hi>Naples</hi> on Horse-back, <hi>Prosper</hi> looked as big upon his
Prancer, as a Holiday-Heroe, and being all over cover'd with
Feathers like an <hi>Indian</hi> Monarch, rode by her side. He enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
the Princess with a World of treble resin'd Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:53808:257"/>
and every other Moment Sung some Amorous Ditties
to her, very Methodically, and like a Man of Art. <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polito,</hi>
who was out of sorts, both as to his Mind and Body
wou'd fain have declined seeing his Rival, and appearing
before so much Company, but <hi>Mathilda,</hi> who knew him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>far
off, because perhaps she saw <hi>Fulvio</hi> with him, who had
parted from her so lately, rode up to him, and <hi>Prosper</hi> and
the rest of the Company did the same. <hi>Mathilda</hi> repreach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Hippolito</hi> in the most obliging manner that could be, that
being her best Friend, he had not done her the Honour to
meet her on the Road, as some of the best Quality in City
and Court had done. <hi>Hippolito</hi> protested to her, that he
had never heard of her happy Return till now, and added, that
altho' he had known of it, he had not presum'd to meet her, for
fear such an unhappy Wretch as he was, should infect and
disturb the publick Joy. <hi>Mathilda</hi> assured him, that he had
disturbed hers, if she had not been so happy as to meet him.
She conjur'd him to come and take part in her good For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
as he had done all along in her Adversity, and added,
that having a design to Marry, because she had found by
woful Experience, that a young Princess without Father and
Mother, had occasion for a Husband of Power and Interest
to Protect her, and that having cast her Eyes upon the Man
she design'd to make Prince of <hi>Tarento,</hi> she desired him to
do her the Honour to assist at her Wedding, which she
wou'd not Celebrate without him. <hi>Prosper,</hi> as having the
principal Interest in this Affair, joyned his Prayers to those of
his Mistriss, and contrary to his Custom, spoke abundance of
Civil things to his Rival, and pretended to be overjoy'd to have
his good Company. A despairing unhappy Man, interprets
every thing to his disadvantage, as a sick Man beyond all
possibility of recovery, turns the best Aliments into Poison.
<hi>Hippolito</hi> took the Civilities and Obliging words of <hi>Mathil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi>
to be so many Cruelties she was minded to persecute
him with. He could not conceive how she could have so
hard a Heart, as to make him be a Spectator of the Nup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Ceremonies. He could not tell what Answer to make
her, and looked upon her with Astonishment. The Faithful
<hi>Fulvio,</hi> who was as much scandaliz'd as himself, curs'd her
heartily behind his Master, and whispering him in the Ear,
desir'd him of all Love not to go: Swearing that she was a
Fury incarnate, to ask him to see her Married to <hi>Prosper.</hi>
In the mean time <hi>Mathilda</hi> redoubled her Petition with so
much Importunity, that <hi>Hippolito</hi> was not able to refuse her.
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:53808:258"/>
She would have him that very Minute get upon a Horse that
was brought to him, and perhaps it might so happen at that
time, that he was not Master of a Pair of Boots. Thus we
see <hi>Hippolito</hi> mounted, very much out of Humour, and out
of Countenance, by <hi>Mathilda</hi>'s side, who rode between him and
<hi>Prosper.</hi> The Princess still continued to talk very obligingly
to him: She exaggerated the Obligations she had to him,
and entertain'd the Company with a recital of all the vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
Actions perform'd by <hi>Hippolito,</hi> both against the Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
that attackt him in the Night, and against the <hi>Moors,</hi>
whom he attackt in the Day, altho' they were much Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior
to him in Number, with a small Body of unexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced
Peasants. She was interrupted by <hi>Prosper,</hi> who with
an Impertinence peculiar to himself, must needs acquaint her
with the Miracles of that famous Night, in which <hi>Roger</hi> was
taken, and with what swiftness he persued the above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
<hi>Calixtus,</hi> who was privy to the Correspondence, which
that chief Minister kept with the Enemies of the State.
<hi>Mathilda</hi> did not bestow much Attention upon his Discourse,
and still addrest he self to <hi>Hippolito,</hi> altho' the latter sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
made her any Answer. But <hi>Prosper</hi> by telling the same
Story a hundred times over, made People listen to him, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they would or no, and whatever happen'd to be talked
of, he perpet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ally loaded the Conversation with the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
Service he had done the King and Government, in
running after <hi>Calixtus.</hi> He had mortified the Company much
longer with this important Exploit, if the King had not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd,
attended by all the Topping Persons of both Sexes at
Court and City. <hi>Prosper</hi> to shew what a fine Figure he made,
rode towards the King, and then without knowing why or
wherefore, rode back again to <hi>Mathilda,</hi> with full as little
Reason, and presented her to his Majesty, altho' there was
no occasion for it. She was received by him, as well as she
could desire or expect: He excused himself for all his ill
Usage of her, laying the blame of it upon <hi>Roger,</hi> and to
make her some reparation for the Injuries, which by the
Instigation of this treacherous Favourite he had done her, he
bestowed upon her one of the best Preferments in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
<hi>Mathilda</hi> thanked the King with a great deal of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,
but much more Wit. I will not here pretend to set
down, any of the fine Compliments, that her Gratitude sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested
to her upon this occasion. I will only tell you, that
they were admired, nay, and applauded by all the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
as I have been credibly inform'd. <hi>Prosper</hi> likewise in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terposed
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:53808:258"/>
to thank the King for her, but only repeated
what she had said before. In the mean time <hi>Irene</hi> rode up
to <hi>Hippolito,</hi> whom she knew behind some of the foremost,
and seeing her self out of the King's sight, threw her self
about the Neck of her dear Brother, who had made her shed
so many Tears, and drew some from her now. <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lito,</hi>
who loved <hi>Irene</hi> as much as so amiable a Sister deserv'd,
embraced her in so tender a manner, that it was enough to
soften a Heart of Iron or Marble, according as the Reader pleases.
The King who missed <hi>Irene,</hi> and could not be long with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
her, looked for her in the crowd, and perceiving her
with her Brother, his amorous impatience must needs make
him ride up to her. He did not receive <hi>Hippolito</hi> as a bare
Subject, when she presented him to his Majesty. <hi>Mathilda
Prosper,</hi> and in short all the Persons of Quality about the
King, observed that he talked to <hi>Hippolito</hi> after such a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
as made some of the Politicians in the Company then
conclude, that this Cavalier would make no little figure at
Court. But all the King's smiles could not cure him of
that mournful Air, which the Gaiety of his Rival occasioned
in him, who appeared as jolly and well satisfied as if he had
the whole World at his beck. All this while the Sun who dart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his Rays very fiercely upon this noble Company, warm'd
most of their Heads deliciously, but especially those that
were bald. All the Flies from the Sea-shore, the Gnats from
the Neighbouring places, those which the Horses belonging
to the King's Retinue had brought with them from <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi>
those which <hi>Mathilda</hi>'s Horses brought with them
more distant Parts; in sine, all these buzzing Insects, which
we may call the Parasites of the Air, incommoded their Faces
exceedingly, tormented their Horses cruelly; and those poor Tits
were most exposed to these cursed Flies, that had the least
Tails to whisk about them. I must own indeed that the
Umbrellas protected those that had them from the Sun, but
not from the burning Reverberation of the Earth, or from the
Clouds of Dust, with which the Si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tole and Diastole of the Lungs
commonly called Respiration, fill'd the Throats of all the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
his Majesty not excepted. In a Word, the place was not
tenable; but to the great Consolation of those who suffer'd most
by the Sun and Flies, the King who was never weary where
<hi>Irene</hi> was, had not as yet told <hi>Mathilda</hi> all that he had
a mind to tell her, and therefore talking loud enough to be
heard by those that were about him, he spoke the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
numerical, individual Speech to her, for it was faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:53808:259"/>
repeated to me Word for Word. <q>Beautiful Princess!
after the Persecutions you have suffered from me, and in
some measure by my orders, and after all the losses you
have sustained, you would have little reason to be satisfied
with me, and I should have as little to be satisfied with
my self, if I did not do all that lay in my Power to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
as much to your Happiness, as hitherto I have
done to your Misfortunes. 'Tis not enough that I have
declared you Innocent, that I have restored to you all
that was taken from you; nay, that I have encreas'd your
Fortune by my Favours, if I don't see you married to
the Prince of <hi>Salerno.</hi> By making you this present of the
Prince, I acquit my self in part of what I owe you;
and by rewarding him with so beautiful a Lady as your
self, I think I sufficiently require him for all the great
Services he has done the State. Ah! Sir, said <hi>Mathilda</hi>
to him, let your Majesty take care that while you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to be just to <hi>Mathilda,</hi> you be not so to <hi>Prosper.</hi>
Acknowledgment has its excess, as well as Ingratitude.
You will not give <hi>Prosper</hi> all that he deserves, in giving
him only <hi>Mathilda,</hi> and in giving me the great Prince of
<hi>Salerno,</hi> you will give me more than I deserve. I am as
well satisfied with your Majesty, as 'tis possible for me to
be; and these last Testimonies of your Goodness, which
I owe to my Misfortunes, render them so dear to me, that
they will be the most agreeable things I can think of as long
as I live. But, Sir, <hi>continu'd she,</hi> since your Majesty is
so Religious as to pay what you think you owe, and
since a Subject ought to govern himself by the good Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of his Prince, will not your Majesty give me leave,
now you have put me in a Capacity to pay my Debts,
to do it immediately upon the Spot, and pay others in the
same Coin they have paid me. Draw near therefore brave
<hi>Hippolito, said she to this Cavalier,</hi> turning towards him,
come and thank my Gratitude, after you have had so much
reason to complain of my Unkindness. I owe you a love of
many Years, which is not in the least lessen'd by my ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treatment
of you. I owe you, besides the Expences where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
this constant Passion has engag'd you, and besides the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
part of your Estate which you spent to support my
Quarrel, and your <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ine House, which was burnt all along
of me; I owe you I say, my Honour and my Life, that
were in danger between the Robbers and the <hi>Moors,</hi> and
I owe you likewise a Life, which you hazarded in my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance.
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:53808:259"/>
I will take care to acquit my self, Generous
<hi>Hippolito,</hi> of all these Obligations; but those I have to
<hi>Prosper,</hi> being of the oldest date, are consequently the more
pressing, and must be first discharg'd.</q> 
                  <hi>Hippolito</hi> look'd as
pale as Death at these last Words of <hi>Mathilda,</hi> and
immediately redden'd after he had looked pale. <hi>Prosper</hi>
Smil'd upon him, and gaz'd at <hi>Mathilda</hi> with a very
Amorous look, who spoke to him as follows. <q>Prince
of <hi>Salerno!</hi> You would make me believe that you loved
me from my Infancy, and indeed you have always treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
me like an Infant. You made your self to be fear'd
by her, whom you called your pretty Mistress, you have
always amused her with sine Complements and Songs, or
treated her with Reproaches and Reprimands, at the time
when she expected the most important Services from you.
In fine, the greatest token of Love you ever gave me,
was a Present of some of your old Feathers, which I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
to keep for your sake, and have been as good as
my Word. With this she took the Cap off her Head, which
<hi>Prosper</hi> had given her, in the Days of Yore, and presenting it
to him. At the same time, <hi>continued she,</hi> that I discharge
my Debt, by returning you the fair Words and Feathers
you gave me, I bestow my self upon <hi>Hippolito,</hi> and make
him Prince of <hi>Tarento,</hi> to acquit my self towards the most
generous of all Men, whom I have always found to be a
<hi>Man of Deeds and not of Words.</hi>
                  </q> When she had said these
Words, she gave <hi>Prosper</hi> his fatal Cap with one Hand,
and with the other the took that of the despairing <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polito,</hi>
who from that happy Moment ceased to be so, and no
more dream'd of this unexpected Happiness, than <hi>Prosper</hi> did of
being repay'd with his Cap. The King, as well as his Courtiers,
was not a little surpriz'd at this sudden turn of the Scene;
but <hi>Irene</hi>'s great Interest with him, and the Justice as well
as generosity of <hi>Mathilda</hi>'s Action, made him approve it:
And the Commendations he bestowed upon the Princess at
the same time, kept the Prince of <hi>Salerno</hi> in his Duty, who
blushing with Shame and Confusion, could not tell how to
behave himself, and we may suppose that if it had not been
for the fear he lay under of displeasing his Master, he would
have quarrel'd with <hi>Mathilda,</hi> according to his ancient Custom,
if the Interest of his Fortune had not been too prevalent for
his natural Arrogance. The King took pitty of him, and
presenting <hi>Camilla</hi> to him after he had talked a while in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
with her and <hi>Iren<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> told <hi>Prosper</hi> that so beautiful
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:53808:260"/>
a Lady with all her own Charms, and her Brother <hi>Roger</hi>'s
Estate might very well comfort him for the loss of <hi>Mathil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da.</hi>
In the mean time all the Court strove who should be
most forward to Congratulate this Princess upon her just
choice of <hi>Hippolito,</hi> and to assure this happy Lover how
overjoy'd they were at his good Fortune. They were most
plaguily embarrassed on both sides, to find out Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to serve them upon this occasion, and were forc'd to
repeat the same things over and over again: But the King
came very luckily to deliver them out of this trouble. <q>Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
Princess! <hi>says he to</hi> Mathilda, you have taught me
that we ought to discharge our Debts when we are able.
I therefore acquit my self of the Debt I owe to <hi>Irene</hi>'s
Beauty and Wit, and this Day make her Queen of <hi>Naples.</hi>
                  </q>
This unexpected Declaration of his Majesty surpriz'd, as
we may imagine, the Company infinitely more, than that
of <hi>Mathilda</hi> had done. <hi>Irene</hi> throwing her self at
the King's Feet, testified to him by her Respect and her
Silence, her Humility and Resignation. The King rais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
her up, kissing her Hand, and from that Moment
treated her as he would have done the greatest Queen in
the World. All these strange Adventures so took up Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
Thoughts, that those that were most incommoded by
the heat, complain'd of it no longer. In short they turn'd
back towards <hi>Naples,</hi> where all sorts of Rejoicings began,
till all things were prepar'd for the King's Marriage, who
caused that of <hi>Hippolito</hi> and <hi>Mathilda,</hi> as likewise that of
<hi>Prosper</hi> and <hi>Camilla</hi> to be deferr'd, that the same Day
might be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ignaliz'd by three such illustrious Weddings. The
King never repented of chosing <hi>Irene</hi> for his Wife. <hi>Mathil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi>
who was of so loving a temper, that she loved <hi>Prosper</hi> more
then he deserved, for no other reason but because he hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd
to be loved by her first, loved <hi>Hippolito</hi> exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly,
who for his part loved her as much when a Husband,
as he had done when a Gallant. Only <hi>Camilla</hi> lived unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
with <hi>Prosper.</hi> She durst not refuse him for fear of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending
the King, who punished <hi>Roger</hi> only with Banishment;
and thus to save her Brother's Life, she render'd her own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easy,
being marryed to a Covetous, Impertinent, Jealous
Prince, who while he lived was the scorn and laughter of
the Court of <hi>N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

known to be one of the wittiest Men of his Age,
and Husband to the great Madam <hi>de Maintenon,</hi>
whose Polities and Wit have made her famous

at <hi>Paris,</hi> at <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> and elsewhere, thought
it would not be unacceptable to the <hi>English</hi> Reader,
if we got them Translated and Collected into one
Volume, which we were the more induc'd to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take,
because the Third Part of the Comical Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
was never in <hi>English,</hi> as likewise seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
of his Novels and Characters, and because
Part of his Works had been Translated near Forty
Years ago, from Copies neither so Correct nor
full, as this last <hi>Paris</hi> Edition, from which we
had this Translation. Besides that, what was
Printed of our Authers in <hi>English,</hi> was part in a

be bound together. Some Persons may object why is not
the <hi>City Romance</hi> here? To which we answer, it
was none of his, but only Father'd upon him to make
it sell; and our design was only to Publish his Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine
Works, which we have done from the best
<hi>Paris</hi> Edition; and as to the <hi>English,</hi> we hope the
Translators have done themselves and you Iustice,
several of these Novels being interspers'd in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical

               <p>YOU have not a better Friend upon the Face of the
Earth than Fame. If you knew how many Good
Offices she daily does you where'er she goes, you
would own you have a thousand Obligations to her.
Ever since the City of <hi>Orleans</hi> has been taken—
by a Young Princess, attended by Two Countesses, who wont
give the Wall to any two Counts in Christendom, this ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
Babbler has deafen'd all the World with the Recital of
your Exploits. But 'tis agreed on all hands, that 'tis impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for her to talk too much of them: so let us e'en leave her to
prattle as she pleases, and not Reproach her for being guilty of
the Sin of Repetition. I confess, the Action was Noble and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roic,
and my Muse lies under a violent Temptation to try how
she can Celebrate it, tho' I have laid an Injunction upon her to
be a Mute as long as I live. How in the name of Wonder!
What Scale a City? I defie our fiercest Heroes to do more than
your Illustrious Heroine; even <hi>Clorinda</hi> and <hi>Camilla</hi> could not
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:53808:262"/>
have behav'd themselves more bravely at the Assault, than your
Ladyship and Madam <hi>de Frontenac.</hi> You are two Bold-spirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

nor the Gallant <hi>Dunois,</hi> have carry'd their Glory farther by
following the Steps of the Old Maid of <hi>Orleans,</hi> that was burnt,
than you have acquir'd Reputation by imitating the Modern
one, who Burns all that behold her:
<q>
                     <l>Her Charming Eyes inflame the Nation,</l>
                     <l>And cause a General Conflagration.</l>
                  </q>
In short, let the Great Prince, who will make her change her
Name one of these days, be as Brave as he pleases, I question
not but all the World will own, that the Lady is in all respects
as good as the Lord; nay, I dare almost swear, before I have
seen <hi>America,</hi> whither my Dog of a Destiny will send me in
my latter days, that at my coming there I shall hear the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi>
talk of the Noble Exploits, which her Incomparable
Royal Highness, attended by her Brave Lieutenant-Generals,
has perform'd for the Party. I would expatiate upon this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument

               <p>YOU must certainly have little or no Business upon your
hands in your Kingdom of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> since you can
condescend to Write to such a mean Fellow as I am; or else
Madam <hi>de Viger</hi> has got entire Possession of your Heart and
Soul, since you could put your self to the Expence of so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Lines, to let me know what famous Exploits she has per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
in Peace and War. For my part, if she is so hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
as you tell me she is, I must freely own to you, that I
would much rather break my Leg, than have known her
when I was able enough to lead up a Country-Dance; and I
would advise you, dear Friend of mine, not to meddle there,
since you have not much time to lose. But after all, is
not this Miracle of Beauty purely fram'd in your own Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination?
For you tell me such strange<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Stories of her, that
I protest I should not believe 'em, but that I know you too
well to think you would say so many fine things for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
Till you thought fit to undeceive us, 'twas an Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
of Faith with us at <hi>Paris,</hi> that nothing at <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> was
capable to inspire Love but M. <hi>Guyonet:</hi>
                  <q>
                     <l>Whose Smiling Looks and Charming Air,</l>
                     <l>The Hearts of ev'ry Nymph ensnare.</l>
                  </q>
But since we have read your Letter, we easily believe, that
if Madam <hi>de Viger</hi> makes a right use of her Charms, she will
at least make as many Slaves, as <hi>Guyonet</hi> has made unhappy
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:53808:263"/>
Damosels, and will abundantly revenge her self upon the
poor Men, for all those Ravages which that dangerous Hero
of <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> has made on her own Sex. But tell me dear
Friend of mine, fairly and honestly tell me, are you not afraid
to make one of those Slaves; you that pretend to be such a
Servant to Love? As for me, were I now what you tell me
you are,
<q>
                     <l>Qualis eram bonae</l>
                     <l>Sub regno Cinarae</l>
                  </q>
And were at this present Writing upon the Banks of the <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronne,</hi>
where she makes so many Flowers spring under her
Feet, it would—let me see—it would at least cost me
two or three Thousand Inquietudes, seven or eight Hundred
Jealousies, the Devil and all of restless Nights and uneasie Days,
and numberless Tuns of Tears; for you must know, I have as
good a hand at Crying as any Man in the World, nay even as
your self, tho' you can cry like any Priest in a Lent-Sermon.
But to return to Madam <hi>de Viger,</hi> 'tis a thousand pities that
she is Wiser than <hi>Solomon:</hi> to my knowledge there are abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of Men in the World, that would be content with all
their hearts, to be as great Fools for her, as the Queen of
<hi>Sheba</hi> was for the aforesaid King of <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> For instance,
your humble Servant, who does not pretend to be so Wise as
the Son of <hi>Bersheba,</hi> as she it seems tells you I am, tho' for my
part I think her ten times more Amiable than the Queen of

               <p>I Have liv'd the most Regular Life in the World, and have
taken as much Care of my self as a dying Pope, and all in
Obedience to the Commands you were pleas'd to lay upon me,
not to Die till you had seen me. But Madam, with all my
Care and Caution I find my self a Dying, out of the impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
desire I have to see you. If you had better consider'd
your own Strength and mine, you would never have put me
upon so unrighteous a Task. You Ladies, forsooth, with your
Charms and other Merits, imagine that you have nothing to
do but Command, and carry all before you; but we poor
Wretches forsooth cannot dispose of our Lives just as you would
have us. In my Opinion now, you may content your selves
to kill those Gentlemen, that see you sooner than they
desire, without obliging those to Live, who are depriv'd of
your Sight, as long as you desire it. You may e'en thank your
self if I cannot Obey this first Command of yours, since you
have hastned my Death: though one would have thought,
that, to please your Ladyship I should have had as good a Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach
to live a Hundred Years as any Man else. But Madam,
can you not change me this kind of Death? for if you cou'd,
you'd infinitely oblige me. These foolish Deaths that come
from Love and Impatience, are by no means proper for one of
my Age, much less are they things I have a fancy for; and if
I have Wept a hundred times in my life for those unhappy
Gentlemen that dy'd of these Distempers, pray consider how
lamentably I shall bewail my self, who take it for granted,
that I shall die this pretty Death. But 'tis impossible for a
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:53808:264"/>
Man to avoid his Destiny, and whether I had been your Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
or liv'd a thousand Miles from you, 'tis all one, for I am
fated to receive my Deaths Wound from you. What comforts
me is, that if I had seen you, my Death had been ten times more
cruel than now it is like to be. I am inform'd on all hands, that
you are a very Dangerous Person, and that those who look upon
you without due Care, grow Sick upon't immediately, and are
not Long-liv'd. Therefore Madam, I will keep to the Death
you have allotted me, and forgive you for it with all my heart.

               <p>TO Offer your Majesty a Play of my own Composing, is to
make you a Present unworthy of your Merit and Quality;
but 'tis my Opinion, that every Man ought to be Tax'd accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his Estate, towards the Payment of that Tribute,
which all our present Writers are oblig'd to pay you. The
Authors of the <hi>Augustan</hi> Age, paid the same Tribute in Verse
and Prose to that Patron of Wit, <hi>Mecaenas</hi> of Happy Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
whom your Majesty knows much better than my self, by
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:53808:265"/>
the Testimony of all the Poets, to have been a very generous
gallant Person. But notwithstanding all the Noise that his
Name has made in the World, he has no other Advantage over
your Majesty at present, than that of being born before you,
and I durst lay every farthing I have in the Kingdom of
<hi>Parnassus,</hi> that your Majesty would have carried away all his
Practice from him, and made him as angry, as the Great <hi>Gusta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vus</hi>
your Father would have made his Master <hi>Augustus,</hi> if
he had been to dispute the Empire of the Universe with
him. But Madam, if so inconsiderable a Wretch as I am may
be allow'd to put a few Questions to so great a Queen as you are,
does not your Majesty find your self sometimes incommoded
by being so great a Heroine? Even extraordinary Merit
has its Inconveniences, and those solemn Trifles call'd Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
Dedicatory, which we Poets, forsooth, would palm for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense
upon the Persons whom we pretend to deifie, are not
always of the same Value, nor have they the same Effect.
Some of these Druggs make a mighty Smoke, but do not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fume;
and indeed I am not Prophet enough to foretel whether
what I now offer to your Majesty will pass in your Court
for right <hi>Spanish,</hi> or Common Essence. The late Prince of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range</hi>
thought otherwise of it, and found it to answer. If
your Majesty likes it, pray don't be sparing of it. I shall
soon have a Recruit and will keep it for your Use, whom all

of former Ages, to eclipse all those of the present, and to be
the best Example for all that come after you to Copy. This

               <p>YOU take a Pleasure perhaps to be Generous, but pray be
undeceiv'd. 'Tis the greatest Plague can happen to a
Person of Quality, when he is so indiscreet as to show any Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to such an unfortunate Fellow as I am. 'Tis not enough
with us Authors to be once oblig'd, for we are importunate
Duns to our Patrons as long as we live. T'other day you gave
me <hi>Voiture</hi>'s Works, and am I not an Impudent Fellow to ask
you a thing of greater Importance? I know some Lords in the

Words, but the Duke of <hi>Retz,</hi> I am persuaded, will read 'em
without any dread, and I dare engage, that he is as impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to know what I am going to Beg of him, as I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
I shall obtain it. The Matter, in short, is as follows. A
Young Gentleman of my Acquaintance, who at Twenty Years
of Age has Fought Twenty Duels, and all as Noble as that of
the <hi>Horatii</hi> and <hi>Curiatii,</hi> and who is as Wise as Valiant, has
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:53808:269"/>
Kill'd an Impudent Scoundrel that forc'd him to Fight him.
Now he cannot get his Pardon out of <hi>Paris,</hi> and by his good
will wou'd be in Security there, because he has a Natural A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
for Hanging. I could make a shift to find him a Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at a certain Prince's Palace, but then he would run the
risque of Starving there; now I humbly conceive, that Famine
is rather worse than the Gallows. If you will be pleas'd to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
him Sanctuary in your House, I know he will have no
reason to fear either one or the other; and besides, 'twill be no
little Satisfaction to you, to have protected a Young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of his Merit. This is not all, for you'll take the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Pleasure in the World to see him Snuff the Candles with a Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stol,
as often as you have a mind to see the Pastime. As you are
the most Generous Person living, I don't doubt but you'll thank
for me giving you so handsom an occasion to exercise your Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rosity,
and for my part I promise you it shall not rest here; for as
soon as you have granted me this Favour, I will every day
importune you to employ your own Interest and that of your

silent of such a Kindness, but will endeavour to show her Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,

               <p>I Have sent your Majesty some of my Works, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
you have not yet seen. If you find any thing in
them to Please you, I shall be as glad as 'tis possible for a
Man to be, who after he has had the Honour of seeing you,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:53808:269"/>
is now so Unhappy as to be depriv'd of that Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing.
Nothing was wanting to compleat the Calamities of my
Life, but that I should afflict my self for your Majesty's Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
and at the same time Envy all those that are near you.
I don't know whether these Persons are sensible of the Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
they enjoy, but I shall reckon them the most Stupid
of all Irrational Animals, if they entertain not the highest
Admiration and Respect for your Majesty. As for me, if I
were in their place, and able to ramble from one Country to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
I should immediately set up for a little <hi>Orlando</hi> for
your sake. 'Tis true, I should not with one single Stroak of
my Sword fell so many thumping Trees, or commit so many
Ravages as my Brother Hero in <hi>Ariosto.</hi> My Follies
should give more Diversion than his, tho' they were nothing
near so Terrible, and perhaps they would not excite less Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion.
You see Madam, I have made use of the Permission
your Majesty gave me, as being a Gallant of no Consequence,
to be that for the greatest Queen that ever was, which this
Romantick Blusterer was for a Queen that was never in being.
'Twas well your Majesty gave me this Permission, for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
I might have taken it, and by refusing it, you might
have seen your self Dis-obey'd by one, who would not do
it upon any other Occasion, tho' it cost him his Life. Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
aside Majesty, you are, Madam, one of the most Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Women in the Universe. Whereever you go, your Eyes
make you more Subjects than a great Kingdom gave you, and
as they do of themselves all those Miracles we have seen them
do, without your taking any Pains to Teach them, we must be
forc'd to own, they are the Finest and most Charming Eyes in
the World, but withal the most Dangerous. Thus I behold no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but Rivals in all the Persons that come to see me, and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
no fewer Rivals among the Ladies, which is none of the

Adventurers, tho' by the by, their end is not very much

of <hi>Sweden;</hi> you ought therefore, like her, to give me
leave to be in love with you, and allow me the Honour of a
Passion, which now perhaps no longer depends upon your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.
If you are of opinion that I ask more than you ought
to grant me, or that I undertake more than I am able to
perform, I will content my self with being one of your
Friends, and conceal the Lover from you. Unless you think
fit to allow me this Favour, you must e'en discard me your
Service, which will be a severe Mortification to me, for I have
a furious desire to please you with all my Might. After so
frank a Declaration, you may very well imagine, that I would
not deceive you for all the World, I will therefore honestly
acquaint you with all the good and ill Qualities of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
who is resolv'd to devote himself to you while he lives.
His Body, in truth, is somewhat ill-shap'd and out of sor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

as you could not but observe when you saw him, and Women
with Child are forbidden to make him any Visits. As for
his Soul, he is so well satisfy'd with it, that he would not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
it with any but yours. When he is in love, he loves
with so much violence, that he is sometimes asham'd of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
for it; and since all must out, although he is nicely pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
in discharging the Offices of Friendship, yet he is a
little remiss in writing to his Friends. But then he speaks
well of them upon all Occasions, with a sort of Fury too, and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:53808:270"/>
sometimes so much, as to tire his Hearers; and when he is
oblig'd to espouse a Man's part whom he pretends to love, a
Lyon and he are one and the same thing. If you like me
after this Description, I am entirely at your Service. Thus

Come, let us go to Confession, Madam, and honestly own,
that neither of us were so sincere as we ought to have been
in the first Letters we writ to one another, and that if it is
impossible not to speak to you of Love, being so Beautiful
as you are, 'tis no less so for me, who pretend to an indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent

of your Letter is as sincere as the Beginning of it is
otherwise, the good Opinion you promise to have of me, will
produce tragical Effects at Court; and you will see hundreds of
Pretenders there cripple themselves, and all to rival me. For
my part I can't help it if they do; and tho' I shall strive by the
Violence of my Passion to deserve what your natural Goodness
permits me to hope, yet I shall not be so love-sick neither, as
to attempt to please you at the Loss of my Understanding.</p>

was when you left it; that for one Man of Sence, you may see
a hundred thousand that are not, and never will be, and that
it is with the Women just as 'tis with the Men. The young
Sparks of <hi>Paris</hi> carry the World before them in the Absence
of the Court; wear their long Perriwigs and Swords, and set
off every thing with an Air of Quality. There is scarce a
Quarter of the Town but some Poet, either good or bad, lives
in it; or a House that receives Visitants but is plagued every
Day, at least, with half a score empty Praters or conceited
Coxcombs. Now I talk of Houses, mine is the only House
in <hi>France,</hi> where the merriest Tales are to be heard, and where
you have the greatest Power. Your Health is often drank
among us, and <hi>d'Elbene</hi> rails at you like a Dragon, when he
and I are at our Kickshaw Repasts. As for me, I find my self
daily decline, and go down the Hill much faster than I cou'd
desire. I have a thousand Pains, or rather a thousand Legions
of Devils in my Legs and Arms; yet in this wretched Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
have been so undaunted and rash, as to love you most
inordinately. I can't tell how the Freak came to take me in

deal of Friendship and Esteem in my Debt; so that if you do
me Justice, I shall have Reason to boast that I was so happy in
the latter end of my Life, as to make the most advantageous
Acquaintance I ever had, meaning your self. 'Tis true, my
Ambition, as great as it is, ought to stop here; but you have
told me so many things of Monsieur <hi>Manchini,</hi> that I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
never to release you of the Promise you made me, to
bring me acquainted with him; provided always, nothing in
this Letter to the contrary notwithstanding, that he is not a
Man of mighty Complements, and the Reason is because I
immediately fall a weeping whenever I hear 'em, or am forc'd
to make 'em my self, and come off so sneaking and pitiful
that you'd laugh at me. In short, Compliments are my A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version,

               <p>THE Proceedings at the Town-hall to morrow will be ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Battle of <hi>Pharsalia</hi> to me. I mean, my Destiny will
be decided there; and I shall know in a few Minutes whether
'tis worth my while to live, or whether I must go hang my self.
I therefore coniure you, Oh Gallant <hi>du Rincy,</hi> to represent to
the generous <hi>Pelisson,</hi> that this is an Affair of Consequence,
that he must now or never redouble the Recommendation of
his Patron, before whom every Knee bows, and get him to
speak to the Provost of the Merchants, and the four Sheriffs
who are to meet on <hi>Thursday</hi> Morning about ten, at the Town<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall.
It will not be enough barely to desire them to do Justice,
for that they owe to the meanest Scoundrel, but to beg a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of them, if there be Occasion for it: But between Friends
the Affair is honest, and they may easily pass it without getting
the ill will of one Man in the City.</p>

divert himself with reading my Letters. I cannot imagine how
you come to think them so pleasant at <hi>Brussels,</hi> for the Person
that writes them at <hi>Paris</hi> is to my Knowledge sometimes so

               <p>IT vexes me that at the very time, when you tell me I
might divert his Highness, I cannot write to you with that
Gayety as I would, and that my Hand rebells against my Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations;
for to my sorrow I have been plagu'd with a cruel Fit
of the Gout for this Month last past as well as his Highness; as
if I had not had Miseries enough before to torment me. All
I can do under this new Indisposition and those other Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
my ill Fortune persecutes me with, tho' I say it without
Boasting, is, that I swear as heroically, and with as good a
Grace as any Man in <hi>France;</hi> and I humbly conceive that if
his Highness wou'd now and then condescend, like other frail
Mortals, to swear a little, he wou'd find some Relief and Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit

plentifully as I do; but if his Highness would sometimes
stumble upon an Oath or so, without any Wicked Intention,
but only to expectorate himself; I fansie it would not be
amiss. For my part I am sometimes so very mad, that if all
the Furies in Hell came to fetch me away, I believe in my
Conscience, I should almost go and meet them half-way.
This is the second Melancholy Letter I have plagu'd you with.
If his Highness were as well acquainted with the nonsensical
Stuff of our witty Coxcombs as he is with Military Affairs, and
every thing else that happens in the World, it would be some
Diversion to him to read this Letter. Madamoiselle <hi>de l' En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clos,</hi>

               <p>YOU oblige me in the most sensible Part, when you write
to me. I have no other Comfort in this World but my
generous Friends; and when you are pleased to assure me that
you are still one of that Number, you rejoice me infiniteély
more than the General Peace will do. This Comparison at first
Sight, I suppose, will appear weak to you; and indeed I must
needs own that the Affairs of <hi>Europe</hi> may change a hundred
times, and still for the better, whereas mine are in no likelihood
of mending. But I have a wonderful Desire to see your Prince
once more in <hi>France,</hi> if it were for no other Reason, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<hi>France</hi> has had a very ill hand at Princes this year, altho'
she has more of them than ever, and perhaps the succeeding
years will be no better than the former, as likewise to embrace
my fat, my plump, my jolly <hi>M—</hi> for I make no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
but that the <hi>Flemish</hi> Double Beer has improv'd his Shape
to a Miracle. But is it possible that the Great <hi>Conde</hi> should
know I am still in the World? My Friend <hi>Guenault</hi> told me
that he saw the Second Part of my <hi>Comical Romance</hi> lie upon
his Table, which has made me as proud as <hi>Lucifer.</hi> These Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Devils call'd Hero's wou'd be worth their weight in Gold,
wou'd they but stoop so low as to have a little Love for us
poor Mortals, who love them exceedingly. As for yours, one
would swear that a Hundred Hero's at least went to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of him, since he has put our invincible Troops so often to
the scamper. It may truly be said of him, that if he was a great
Prophet in his own Country, which the Scripture tells us no
Man ever was, he was a greater in a Foreign Country. If he
takes the Trouble to cast his Eye upon the Five Letters I have
sent you, pray let me know what he says of them. The Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
Letter comes just now from me piping hot, the rest
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:53808:274"/>
were written last year. I will shortly send you a Sketch or
Essay that has something of the Spirit of Satyr in it; 'tis my
Misfortune that 'tis writ upon a Rascal who is not known
enough in the World. In short 'tis a Son of a Whore of an
Extortioner that owes me Six hundred Pistols, and refuses to
pay me. But, to drop this Villain, I will tell you after what
Manner the Third Volume of my Comical Romance begins.
<hi>There were not as yet any Iilting Females in the World, and these</hi>

                  </gap>cooks and Vintners,
who robbed all the Coaches and Chairs that came in their
Way, and several <hi>Gavottes, Fanchons,</hi> and <hi>Nanons,</hi> that have
now Stone Doublets upon their Backs, are in great Danger of
swinging in the Air. I must tell you be way of Digression that
my Countrymen the <hi>Parisians</hi> are, generally speaking, valiant
enough in all Conscience, but they have a strange Inclination
to die in their Shooes, and cut Capers under a cross piece of
Timber. Now I talk of violent Deaths, I will tell you of one
that is not altogether so scandalous as Hanging, but full as
terrible. Before I enter into my Story, you are to understand
that at <hi>Charenton,</hi> the next Day after their <hi>Sundays</hi> or Holidays,
the Devil a jot of any thing you can get to eat there, and new
Bread is as hard to come by as a Maidenhead at Court. It
was upon a <hi>Monday,</hi> when the Furious <hi>Rincy,</hi> the Eloquent
<hi>Pelisson,</hi> the never-to-be-too-much commended Madam <hi>Scudery,</hi>
and the discreet Madam <hi>Bocquet,</hi> at half an hour after Ten
precisely in the Morning, sent word to that Pink of Courtesy
the Noble <hi>Izar,</hi> who had been about eight Days at <hi>Charenton</hi>
to take the Air, that they intended to dine with him, and that
he needed to provide nothing else but a good Soop and a Des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert,
because they would bring Victuals along with them from
the Cook's. <hi>Izar</hi> and a Man of the Law, whose Name was
<hi>du Mas,</hi> that kept him Company in the Country, set all
Hands to work, for the better Reception of these Illustrious
Guests; for you must know the four Persons abovementioned
are not to be seen every day together. Three Pullets were
thrown into the Soop, with abundance of Green Pease; and
while a Fellow was sent on horseback to <hi>Bagnolet</hi> to buy Straw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berries,
the most celebrated Pastry-Cooks in <hi>Charenton</hi> were
employ'd in making Tarts and Cheese-cakes. The Garden
was pitch'd upon as the fittest Place to dine in, and both the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:53808:275"/>
Table-cloth and the Napkins, that smelt most daintily of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vender,
were cover'd with a heap of new-gather'd Flowers. At
last our jolly Company of Wits arrives. <hi>Rincy</hi> alights out of
the Coach, and immediately runs into the Kitchin. The
Soop displeased him, and all the Preparations that <hi>Izar</hi> and
<hi>du Mas</hi> had made, and he delivered himself with so much Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemence
and Authority, that from that very moment <hi>du Mas</hi>
began to respect and fear him. He that had a mind to wash
his hands, wash'd them. At last down to Dinner they sate;
<hi>Rincy</hi> made Jests upon the Country-Soop, and was trying to
cut a Loaf asunder, but finding it hard and over-baked, he
made no more adoe but flung it at a neighb'ring Apricock-tree,
by the same token he spoil'd it for ever bearing Fruit more, by
breaking its greatest Boughs. He tries a second Loaf, and
finding it stale and hard as the former, with the same Vigour and
Alacrity he discharges it at another Tree. In short, with six
or seven Loaves of the same hardness with their Predecessors, he
knocks down as many Fruit-trees more, to the exceeding Vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
of the Woman of the House, who ran to prevent the
Desolation of her Garden, and made most horrible Out-cries.
<hi>Rincy</hi> was not a jot moved by them; he swore that no Body
should eat a Bit till they got him some new Bread. Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
were forthwith dispatch'd to all the Houses that baked,
and they found at last some Bread just coming out of the Oven.
It was laid before <hi>Rincy,</hi> who found it so terrible hot, that they
were glad to pick up, among the broken Boughs of the Trees,
those Loaves that had been thrown away, but were much more
eatable than this Bread that burnt their Mouths. <hi>Rincy</hi>'s blunt
Behaviour and Talk exceedingly surpriz'd our Counsellor <hi>du
Mas,</hi> and his imperious Air no less affrighted him. From that
very hour he had <hi>Rincy</hi> always in his Imagination. He could
not sleep without terrible Dreams, and these Dreams were full
of nothing but <hi>Rincy.</hi> At last the Fright that <hi>Rincy</hi> gave him,
threw him into a Fever. This Fever carried him off in less
than fifteen Days, and he died stark raving Mad, talking inces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santly
of <hi>Rincy.</hi>

               <p>SInce the Pasty you were pleased to send me, I have received
your excellent Cheeses. For my part I believe you design
to pamper me with the greatest Rarities in the World. Your
Liberality has extended it self to all my Boarders, who are civil
Persons, I'll assure you, and have drank your Health very
plentifully. If your great Pasty was admirable, your Cheeses
deserve no less Commendation, being as good as 'tis possible
for Cheeses made of Mortal Milk to be. But not to rob your
fine Presents of the Praises they deserve, you must permit me
to say something of the Letter you did me the honour to
write to me, and to tell you that nothing could be more
spritely and more gallant; particularly as for that Passage
where you are pleas'd to tell me that you leave it to others to
regale my Wit, whereas you only pretend to regale my Tast,
I defie our finest Writers to say any thing so happily upon such
an Occasion. By this, my Lord, it appears that you are a Person
of insatiable Ambition, and that you are not content with the
Glory you have acquir'd in the War by your Arms, but you
must triumph over us poor Authors in the time of Peace, win
our Laurels, and carry away the Prize of Eloquence from us.
I wish I had any News to send you. All the Talk of the
Town is about <hi>Meniville</hi> who is dangerously sick. All our
Courtiers are return'd to <hi>Paris</hi> except the Mareschal <hi>de Villeroy.</hi>
So soon as any thing happens that is worth the writing, I will
take care to let you see by so small and inconsiderable Service
as that is, and which indeed is the only one I am able to do you,
with what Zeal I am,</p>

me. I have great Reason to complain of Monsieur <hi>de Chaulne</hi>
for not acquainting me with it sooner, that I might have had
the Honour of coming one of the first, to assure you how
much I am concern'd at whatever affects you. 'Tis undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly
the Effect of my constant ill Fortune, which would
endeavour to make me seem wanting in my Duty to you,
contrary to my Inclinations, in order to make me unworthy of
the Favours I receive from you, and which I never received
from any one besides. Monsieur <hi>de Mares</hi> who did me the
Honour yesterday to make me a Visit, can tell you how much
it troubled me that I should be a Stranger to that which all
the World besides knew. Upon his Encouragement I have
compos'd a wretched Sonnet, which I made some Difficulty
of sending to you, for fear I should renew your Grief. But
my Lord, I had rather be blamed for coming too late, than give
you the least Umbrage that I am unconcern'd at any Affliction,
which has made such an Impression upon you. I am,</p>

               <p>I Was, it seems, but too true a Prophet, when I sent you
word some time ago, that my Ill Fortune was never to be
vanquish'd, but by a Person of the same Generosity and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
with your self. Under my present Circumstances, I
cannot make a better Requital to Mons. <hi>Pelisson,</hi> for his kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in speaking to you of my Affair, and acquainting me
with the obliging Answer you made him, than to send you
the Letter he writ to me on that Occasion. It so truly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scovers
the profound Respect he has for your Lordship that
I presume I shall not make his Court amiss to you, in let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
you know by this means, without his knowing any thing
of the matter, what, perhaps, he is very desirous you shou'd
know, but dares not say it to you. 'Tis a difficult thing to
talk of you, though it were before your Face, and not to
Praise you; 'tis no less difficult to Praise and not to displease
you, but 'tis the most difficult thing of all for one to avoid
Praising you. For this reason I would have some body else
tell you in my stead, that you are the most Generous Man
in the Universe, and that all the Favours you have shown
me, have far exceeded my Wishes and Expectations. But
my Lord, will you not be apt to suspect, that the Good
Office, which I imagine I do my Friend, is not altogether
free from Interest, and don't you think, that my showing
his Letter and commending it to you, so frankly as I do,
is a cunning Trick to make use of his Thoughts, in order
to express my own to you, without running the hazard of
trespassing against your Modesty? I must honesty own to
you, that there is something of that in it; but since I am
not able to conceal it from you, judge by this Free Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
how sincere I am in my Nature; and believe, that

in the least serviceable to you, and I dare not desire that ever
I may be so, for fear of wishing something that might be
Disadvantageous to you. Neither can I hope to contribute
much to your Diversion, not being in a condition to wait
upon you, nor to make my self any otherwise known to
you, than all the rest of the World knows me, that is, for
being an unfortunate abandon'd Wretch, and for Writing
of Books sometimes, that is to say, for being (so my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky

Nusances of Humane Life. But though I were Master of
better Qualities, though an Acquaintance of many Years had
gain'd me your Friendship, and though I were in a capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

of the Ministry would not allow you time to read them.
In truth, my Lord, these Thoughts give me no little unea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness,
as often as I partake of your Liberality; and I am much
asham'd, that I have no way to preserve my self in your
remembrance, but by some miserable Productions of my Mind,

miserable than that jaded Body, have, in a manner, deny'd
all Tranquillity. But, my Lord, since I have hapned to
make mention of my Writings and all that, has my Fable of

<hi>de Chaulne</hi> would fain make me believe it has, but perhaps
he only design'd to flatter an unhappy Wretch. I conjure
you, my Lord, either to give me your Approbation of it
under your hand, which I shall prefer to the Testimony of
all the Academies in the World, or else to censure it, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

Hundred Pistoles, which they promis'd me under Hand and

no manner of Concern in the Affair, neither have I receiv'd a
Farthing of the Mony they promis'd me, in case I procur'd a
Grant for them. Now one Word from you to the Party who

Boldness, as if after a Court of many Years I had done

Generous to that degree as you are, not only oblige their
Friends and Servants, but all those that want their help. They
are incessantly busied to protect the Unfortunate, and see Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
done them; and as for you, my Lord, I believe there
scarce passes a day over your Head, but some Knight or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
Damosel comes to beg relief of you. I therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure
you, as being the most miserable Man in the World, but
one who honours you the most, to grant me a small Favour.
'Tis, my Lord, that you would be pleas'd to prevail with the
Provost of the Merchants, that he wou'd n't oppose the establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
some Offices in the City, the Propriety whereof I have
acquir'd. This Affair may make me easie in the World, and
be worth to me two or three Thousand Livres a Year. But
my constant ill Destiny, which loses not the least opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
to do me a Mischief, has rais'd a busie, troublesome
Coxcomb against me, who, although he has not the least In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:53808:279"/>
in this Affair, has prepossest the Provost of the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,
and made him my Enemy. I desired the President
Mons. <hi>de Guenegot,</hi> to speak a good word for me, and he was so
kind as to carry Mons. <hi>de Franquetot</hi> and my Wife to him;
but his Recommendation has signified little or nothing. I
expect another sort of effect from one of your Letters to
him, which I humbly beg you to write, and send by one of
your own People. When you once let him see that I have
the Honour of being known to you, he will soon draw this
Inference, that it will be worth his while to Oblige me. But
if you would farther be pleas'd to intimate to him, that I
am not indifferent to you, he will make my Business his
own, since he will believe that 'tis yours in some manner;
and you'll receive this Satisfaction by it, that the most Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous

thus he will with more Serenity enjoy the Honour of your

ever wanting in my Respect for your Lordship: I will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
acquit my self towards you, as I am in Duty bound,
and will attempt to write to you in the sublime Stile when
there is occasion for it: But this same individual Man, my Lord,
that will sometimes place half a Foot distance between your
Title and the beginning of his Letter, who will lavish all his
Stock of Hyperboles there, and will not forget the least of
your Qualities, to make his Performance more Solemn and
Authentick, will be sometimes so bold as to trouble you with
Trifles, and strive to cheer up a little that serious Countenance,
which, in my opinion, becomes you so well when you are
making Decrees. In short, he will sometimes endeavour to
<hi>Vn-Cato</hi> you, if I may so express my self. He will not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
presume to offer at this, when you are taken up with
important Affairs of State, and when you are Attorny-General,

Man in the Universe, when you shine by your own proper Light,
without borrowing that of your Dignity and Offices; when ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

Chamber, either at St. <hi>Man<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

he gather'd Cockle-shells on the Sea-shore with his Friend <hi>Lae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius.</hi>
At such a time as this, my Lord, if I had the Happiness
to be in your Company, I would say every thing to you that
came first into my Head, and display my self with all the Gay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety
that Heaven has bestow'd upon me. However, I would
not presume to make so bold with you, till I had your permis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
for it, as the late Cardinal <hi>de Lyon,</hi> upon asking, us'd to
allow me; and as I take without asking of the Cardinal <hi>de
Retz,</hi> when he reposes himself just by me upon a little yellow
Couch, and we talk of something else besides Politicks and
Religion. I may boast, that with these two Eminences I have
triumph'd over that Formal Gravity that uses to accompany the
Red Hat. Both of them formerly made me believe that they
had a Kindness for me. After such Presidents, you may vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe
to afford me a little of your Love without any Shame, and
by the extraordinary Care I took to deserve their Favour, you
may judge with what Zeal I am resolv'd to devote myself to
you. Your Lordship wishes me well for no other considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but because I am Unfortunate; and you have done more
for me in Fifteen Days, than a great number of Noblemen e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
promis'd to do for me, ever since I have been condemn'd a
perpetual Prisoner to my Chair. Within these twenty Years,
there has scarce pass'd a Year over my head, but some of those
Honourable Peers, who come to see in my Chamber just
as People went formerly to see an Elephant, out of Curiosity,
or who come to spend an Afternoon with me, when they are
disappointed in their Visits, or have nothing else to do; there
has scarce pass'd a Year over my head, I say since then, but
some of these Pretenders to Generosity, and Friends in Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querade,
have made me most Magnificent Promises, and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily
offer'd to serve me, or any of my Friends without my
asking: Whereas Mons. the Chief President, whom I never had
the Honour to see in all my life, sent me last Year a considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Present by <hi>Abbé Menage,</hi> a little after I had Dedicated a
Book to him; whereas you, who did not know whether I was
in the World, have Honour'd me with your Favours, and in a
manner too more Obliging than the Favour itself. I presume,
my Lord, I ought not any farther to explain to you what I
desire of you, though you have laid an injunction upon
me to do it: I ought indeed to receive whatever Kindnesses you
think fit to confer upon me, with all imaginable Gratitude, but
I have no Right to prescribe them to you, or to importune you
for them. A Person of your Generosity needs not be instructed
what he is to do. 'Tis enough for the Comfort of my Life
hereafter, that you have been pleas'd to look down from the

Eminent Station wherein you are plac'd, upon that wherein
I am; and I don't at all doubt, after the obliging Letter you

preserve, that I may justly apply to you, what a Celebrated Poet

That which I have hinted to you here in Verse, the good
People of <hi>Narquois de Bigot</hi> use to call <hi>being Visited by the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:53808:283"/>
Lord;</hi> and I have frequently heard some Priests and Monks
Congratulate me, because the Good Lord Visited me oftner
than any one else, and they seem'd to envy me this Happiness,
which I would have quitted to them with all my heart, as
great a step to Salvation as they think it. In troth, I am at
present so bad a Christian, that I can hardly return my Thanks
for such Visits, and want several Rounds of the Ladder, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I can mount up to so perfect a Resignation of my self
to the Will of Providence. In the mean time, I languish in
expectation of what you have made me hope from Monsieur
<hi>Bruant.</hi> I believe, as you send me word, that he is willing
enough to oblige me, but I very much question, whether he
will be able to do much for me. I am likewise of opinion,
that he's puzzl'd enough in all Conscience to find Mony for
the beginning of the Campaign; but so small a Sum would
suffice to Equip me for mine; and what I expect from him
would so little contribute to make him easie, that he may
soon put an end to all my Troubles without increasing his own.
'Tis your Interest, I must tell you, to prevail with him to
do it, that you may deliver your self from the Persecution
of my Billets and Epistles. Now it comes into my Head,
I was Yesterday put into bodily fear. Word was brought
me, that Mons. <hi>Meraut,</hi> Master of the Accounts, must speak
with me. I expected some terrible Business or other; but he
only talk'd of the Repairs of his House, the Overflowing of
the <hi>Seine,</hi> the Affair of <hi>Hedin,</hi> and above all, told me, I was
a Happy Man to have so much Wit.</p>

I happen'd to be without Mony, an Accident that befals

<hi>Richmond,</hi> of whom I Quarterly receive Four Hundred Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vres,
which the <hi>Sur-Intendant</hi> is pleas'd to allow me, and
pray'd him to advance me Ten Days Payment of the

one Mr.—to whom I am an absolute Stranger, and who
censur'd this as a great Fault in me, which however I believe
I shall not correct in my self this pretty while yet. Seeing
my Servant, says he to him, I don't know your Master, he
knows no body but Mons. <hi>de Lorme,</hi> and never Dedicated or
gave any of his Books to me; tell him that he shall not have a
Peny of his Mony till the end of the Month. You may see,
Sir, how this cursed, plaguy Poverty draws Contempt upon
a Man, and that although Queens and Princesses, and
all the Persons of Quality in the Kingdom have had the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosity
to see me, Honour me with their Visits, and Excuse
me from returning them, a rude Whipster of a Fellow shall
impudently insult me. You may likewise see, that although
you are esteem'd and lov'd by all the World, you are not able to

This Writing of Plays is a confounded Fatigue that does
not turn to Account, when a Man spends a World of Time

that he is too Generous to expect Compliments from
those he obliges, and that his Judgment is too discerning not
to know, that to give to such an useless Wretch as my self,
is properly Charity; whereas, to oblige a Person who may
requite us again in Specie, is not doing a Kindness, but down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
Trafficking and Policy. In short, Sir, there is a certain
Conduct I am to observe in this Affair, which I can only learn
from your self, who have known him so long. I did not
think to write so gravely to you, but a Man cannot help some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times

               <head>XLII. A Character.</head>
               <p>SInce Drawing of Characters is so much in Fashion, I am
resolv'd to attempt one: but having a just diffidence of
my own Talent, I will chuse a Subiect so Fertile, that my
Performance, although perhaps 'tis ill executed, shall never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless
find Admirers enough. The Person whom I design to
Paint, is a Man of Quality; Great by his Birth, since he is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended
from the Blood of our Princes, but much greater still
by his Merit. When but Thirty Years old, he was scarce
thought sufficiently rewarded with one of the highest Posts
at Court. He was made an Officer of the Crown, I don't
mean one of those, who are only oblig'd to serve the King in
a Pair of Silk Stockings, and glitter at a Court-Masquerade;
but one of those who want but one Step higher to arrive at
the Supreme Command of War, and whom our Kings may
safely trust with the Defence of our Frontiers, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of our Armies. But he is not as yet where he ought to
be. If Fortune leaves him where he is, 'tis impossible for her
to be more unjust, and if she should heap upon him all that
'tis in her power to give, I can't tell whether it would be
all he deserves. He possesses, without contradiction, all those
shining Qualities, that are requir'd in what we commonly
call a Hero or Demi-God. He was so to me ever since I had
the Honour to know him, and will always be so to the rest
of the World that have any discernment. The greatest Heroes
of Antiquity were in no respect superior to him; and of all
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:53808:284"/>
those that have wore the Sword (for there are People that
wear it in all Professions) I know none that have so Gloriously
employ'd theirs, as my Hero has done both in <hi>France</hi> and
<hi>Flanders.</hi> In both these places, they take a pleasure to talk
of his Victories, as they formerly did in <hi>Rome</hi> to relate that of
<hi>Horatius</hi> over the <hi>Curiatii,</hi> and, if like that valiant <hi>Roman,</hi> he
has been Prais'd for having always beaten his Enemy, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not,
like him, be blam'd for ever turning his Back. But if
he possesses in a more eminent manner than any Man living,
all the essential Ingredients that enter into the Composition of
a Hero, he has no less his Mien. The Charms of his Person
answer his other Qualities, and by them he has triumph'd over
the most formidable Beauties of the Court, as he has over the
Bravest by his Valour; and his Victories in Love equal those
of War. It's true, that he is accu'd for running incessantly
after New Conquests; but the Ambition of a Conqueror scorns
all Bounds, and he that can Vanquish with ease, can hardly
forbear to make an Attack. He is somewhat above the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Size, but not too Tall; and by what we find his Shape
at present, we may easily guess that it has been one of the
Finest in the World. His Head comprehends all the good
Sense we bestow upon Grey Hairs, without wearing their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,
and from the agreeable Air it gives his Face, and from
that it receives from it, there results a Noble Masculine Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
which, without having the Delicacy of that of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
has, notwithstanding, every thing that makes them be
belov'd. I would not in so particular a manner draw the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trait
of his Visage, nor of his entire Person, did I not fear to
be reproach'd, for speaking only of his Advantages, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ying
a design to omit the rest. Therefore, after I have said
that he has fine Teeth, a Beauty that belongs to Men as well
as Women, and without which, the most Accomplish'd may
give disgust. I will own, that his Eyes, tho' lively and full
of fire, are weak to see any thing at a distance, tho' they
lose nothing of what they see near at hand, and that they
are the sweetest in the World. Some Ladies impute to them
the Inconstancy which they condemn in him, and complain of
him for suffering himself to be conducted by such treacherous
Guides, which make him run after every new Object, and are
frequently apt to make him go astray. But is it not their
fault? And the Crime they accuse him of, does it not proceed
from their bad Example? And do they practise those Duties
which they pretend he neglects? A Man may sometimes give
his Eyes leave to look upon Objects that are unworthy of
him, provided he does it only <hi>en passant,</hi> and as in my Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:53808:285"/>
I have hitherto only drawn that which he may have
in common with others, yet w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>at he possesses above the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
rank of Men, what he derives neither from his Birth
and Fortune, but only from himself, is of a much great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Price, and more difficult to Paint. I mean his Soul,
that was never shaken by any Accidents of Fortune, his Wit
that equals the Tranquillity of his Soul, and his natural facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of expressing himself, that is, neither affected nor too study'd.
A Man may be sometimes allow'd to be inconstant in Love,
when he is, like him, the most constant Man in his Friendships.
When I talk'd of the Beauty of his Shape, I forgot that of his
Legs, at a time when our great Guns have conceal'd the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of many of our Ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that so worthless an Insect as I is still in the World,
and you do me no little Honour on your side, to believe me
capable of drawing a Character as it ought to be. Tho' I
should be so vain, as to flatter my self upon this Article, and
my desire to please you should give me that to Paint, yet the
Portraits which her Highness has made, would wholly discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
me from attempting any thing of this nature. They
are, as far as I am able to judge, the finest that were ever
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:53808:287"/>
drawn; and our Wits would have reason to complain of this
Princess, for robbing them of the Glory of Writing well, if
she did not make them sufficient amends, by the Honour she
does them to be of their Profession. A good Character is a
much harder Performance than one would imagine. A Man
ought to be very well acquainted with his Subject, before he
presumes to describe it; but as far as I can see, we scarce know
any thing well but our selves, and some of our intimate Friends.
Now I will appeal to you, whether a Man of Breeding can
commend himself without a great deal of Vanity, and on the
other hand, is he oblig'd to lay open his blind-side to others as
he would to his Confessor? In like manner: Can a Man praise
his Friends without tiring them, or expose their Defects with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
offending them? There are no less inconveniences in prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
those Persons that are indifferent to us: For as a Portrait
ought to be of a known Subject<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> and a Man has no other way of
making himself known but by his Quality and Merit, we run the
risk of Disobliging those whom we ought to Respect and Esteem,
if we don't give them the Praises they deserve. We are taken
for impertinent Fools, if we bestow false Commendations up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them, and let us manage the Panegyrick as nicely as we
can, yet nothing, in my Opinion, is more fulsome and tedious,
either for him that receives it, or for him that gives it, or for
those that hear it. Besides these general Reasons, which have made
me take up a Resolution not to draw any Characters, I have
some peculiar to my self, which I don't doubt but you'll allow.
An unhappy Wretch as I am, that never stirs out of his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
can have no Knowledge either of Men or Things, but by
second hand from others; and you'll agree with me that this is
a great disadvantage to a Painter, who ought to have his Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <p>I Was not in a condition to send you an Answer sooner, by
reason of a great Defluxion in one of my Eyes. Since that
time you have written to Madam <hi>Scarron,</hi> and likewise to Mons.
<hi>de Nossac.</hi> Your two Letters are admirable in their kind, and
deserve to be learnt by heart. A Person of very good Sense, to
whom you are no Stranger, told me when he read them, that he
was confident you were in very good Health, and that your Affairs
went well in the World, since you were able to write two such
diverting Letters. As for me, if I did not know that you writ
both of them with all the ease imaginable, I would say of your
fine Compositions in Prose, wherein you carry the Prize, what
the aforesaid Mons. <hi>d'Elbene</hi> said very pleasantly some time a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go,
of those People that are always aiming to speak witty things
in Company: That in truth, a Man got a great deal of Credit by
always speaking fine things, but that by straining to do so, he
put himself to a great Expence, and that he had made it his
observation, that such Gentlemen did not live long. May Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:53808:288"/>
of its infinite Goodness still preserve you in this secundity of
Wit, and indefatigability of Hand, and may I Fifty years hence
be entertain'd with your happy Productions. But this only by
the by.</p>
               <p>Madam <hi>Scarron</hi> is very unhappy that she has not a Coach and
Six, and a fine Equipage, to go up and down where she pleases,
when so great a Happiness is offer'd her, as that of being invited
to <hi>Brouage</hi> by <hi>Mademoiselle de Manchini.</hi>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Tyber</hi>'s rich Present, and the Pride of <hi>France.</hi>
                  </q>
I hope she'll make her self amends for so great a Loss, so soon
as the Court returns to <hi>Paris,</hi> and that then she'll have the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of being known to that incomparable <hi>Roman</hi> Lady, and
have some share in her Friendship. As for me, I would offer
her my Incense (for you know that we Poets must always have
some Divinity to bestow it upon) but I no less distrust the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of my Present, than I am persuaded, that no Person in the
World deserves the richest Figures of our Poets better than she;
and you know well enough that our Merchandize is slighted,
when 'tis given before 'tis call'd for. <hi>Paris</hi> is as empty as your
<hi>Brouage</hi> is full, tho' I am scarce sensible of it in my little Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
here; for Company so crowds upon us, that I have or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
my Servants to tell all the Princes, Dukes, and Officers
of the Crown that enquire for me daily, that I receive no Visits.
This makes People very ambitious to be admitted into our little
Society, and there is furious canvasing for it both in City and
Court. I don't say this with a design to insinuate, that we at
<hi>Paris</hi> pretend to enter into any competition with your Deities
at <hi>Brouage,</hi> and with your other happy Persons, that enjoy such
instructive Conversation there: But their true Element is <hi>Paris</hi>
or the Court, and when upon their leaving <hi>Brouage,</hi> they leave
you in your Primitive nothing where they found you, you will
be no better nor worse than Country-Bumpkins, and meer
Clowns. Adieu, my Hand akes with Writing.</p>

               <p>I Am extremely oblig'd to you for refreshing me, when I wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
this Morning, with the agreeable Vision of the two An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
of your own making. 'Tis certain you had an excellent
Model by you when you made them, and that you must know
something more of those happy Beings than the rest of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.
Accident and Chance never use to produce any thing so
perfect as they are, especially in things of this Nature, where
a Man must run it off hand in spite of his Teeth, and where
he must finish all at a stroke, or else give over. My Friend
<hi>Roisleau</hi> said very pleasantly upon this occasion, that you ought
to do nothing else but get Children. To return now to yours,
I confess they are admirable, and as every thing has its value, the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:53808:289"/>
greatest is, in my opinion the Eldest of the two; whether it be
because he is more advanc'd than his Brother, who likewise will
have his Admirers stand up for him in his turn: or because my
inclination leads me that way and fixes me there, for which I
can assign no reason. In short, both of them are very worthy
of their Father, and since you would have me tell you by their
Physiognomy what their Fortunes are like to prove; they will
commit a world of Ravages upon People of both Sexes. It will
not be long before the Eldest will begin to push on his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests,
and perhaps will make an Attempt upon some of yours<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

May Heaven in Mercy avert such a Misfortune from your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
which may sow Division between two Brothers, and
make Father and Son two irreconcileable Rivals. There hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to be in my Room when they came thither, three or four
Gentlemen of very good Judgment and Sense, who agreed,
that both of them were Excellent, but were of my opinion,
that the Elder was the better of the two, and have given me
their Votes for him. In truth, I believe that one may justly
say of him,

my self that she still remembers such a Wretch as I was once
in the World. During the Troubles of the Regency, my unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
Reputation made every thing that was printed at <hi>Paris,</hi>
whether Good or Bad, to pass under my Name. This Abuse still
continues, notwithstanding all the Pains I have taken to unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the World. Some insolent Libels against his Eminence
were father'd upon me, and the Reason perhaps was, because
another Gentleman of the Purple, who was of the contrary
Faction to his Eminence, was pleased to honour me with his
Friendship, tho' I was both known and loved by him from
my Youth, long before his Reputation began to sink at Court.
But suppose I had been so ungrateful, and so thoughtless, as to

May not a sincere Repentance hope to find that from them,
which it expects from Heaven? I am not so vain to ask to be
admitted again into her Majesty's good Graces, which the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happiness
of the Time, rather than any Crime of my own,
made me lose. I wou'd only beseech her to drop her Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

This wou'd be worthy of the Generosity of her Soul, and if

Fault, I cou'd not for the Heart of me hinder my poor Hero
from being sentenc'd to be hang'd: And this hanging came in

                  <salute>My Lady Guillemette,</salute>

               <p>I Am an Author, God help me, if a Man may be said to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
that Title, whose Name has appear'd more than once
in a Term-Catalogue, and at the Fag-end of a Gazette, among
stray'd Horses, and now and then, dear Madam, among some
of your Ladyship's stray'd Relations. 'Tis true, I came very
cheap by this Title, and am sensible that the little I have laid
out upon it gives me in Justice no higher a Rank than that of a
Verse-Wright, or a turner of Burlesque-Rhimes. Having
made this modest Acknowledgement, I am confident that you
will never lay the Sin of Vanity to my Charge, and that you'll
hardly imagine (if the Proverb, which says, <hi>No Man is a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
in his own Country,</hi> holds good in you Dogs) that a Man
whom you see every Day in <hi>Paris,</hi> where he was born, whose
Head always hangs on one side, and who never budges out of
his Chair; in fine, one that was cast in a different Mold from
the rest of Mankind, has Courage enough to set up for a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
Author. By <hi>Apollo, Guillemette,</hi> nothing can be more
true; and by the same <hi>Apollo</hi> I swear to you, without any E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivocation
or Reserve, that I have no wicked Design upon the
Bays. For my part, I am so far from setting up for a Wit,
that I freely and frankly give the World leave to call my Works
<hi>Rhapsodicks,</hi> or <hi>Taylor's Cushions,</hi> or what they please; because,
to my great Comfort, abundance of Modern Plays, and
other Productions of our Second-Rate Wits, deserve no better
a Name; which I value little more than I do a last Year's Alma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nack,
wherein we may see, as well as in those Plays, the Death
of some great Man, a Statesman discarded, <hi>Phillis</hi> hanged in
her Garters, and such like noble Catastrophes of the Theatre.</p>
               <p>Now these noble Productions wou'd from their very Infancy
be employ'd to wrap up Butter and Tobacco, to line Trunks
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:53808:291"/>
and Bandboxes, or make Paper Kites, if no Country-Chapmen
came to <hi>Paris;</hi> or if they did not, make a shift to go off under
the Protection of some admirable Plays, and some diverting
Romances, that enrich their Authors, and so often raise a Civil
War among our Booksellers. When we set no great value up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a thing, we use to say, <hi>that 'tis scarce good enough to be thrown
to the Dogs.</hi> As your Merit and Beauty secure you from the
scandal of this Proverb, which was never intended for Dogs of
your eminent Quality, so I only cited it to convince the World,
what an humble Opinion I have of my own Compositions;
and altho', Madam, you are neither better nor worse than a
Brute, yet I rather chose to dedicate them to your Ladyship,
than to any of our topping Noblemen, whom I should cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
disoblige by such a Presumption. For I must tell you,
<hi>Guillemette,</hi> that an Author with a Book in his Hand, is more
formidable to one of these Worthy Peers; and the very sight
of him terrifies them as much, as a whole Covy of Creditors
at their Leveè: Not but that we have some generous Lords
still left us, Heaven be prais'd for't; but most of our Modern
Authors are such Idolaters of Money, that they wou'd much
sooner Dedicate their Works to a Man, from whom they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
a round Sum of Guineas, tho' they don't care if he were
hang'd the Hour after, than one whom they love and esteem.
These fordid Imitators of <hi>Virgil</hi> and <hi>Horace,</hi> that adore a Lord
meerly for his Title make no scruple to dub him a <hi>Maecenas</hi> at
first dash, and ascribe to him Vertues he was never Master of,
and all to wheedle him out of a little Money, if he has any
One wou'd almost swear, that these Prodigal Sons of <hi>Apollo</hi> had
a wicked Design to squander away the whole Growth of <hi>Heli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con</hi>
in one Dedication: they bestow Immortality upon the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
bidder, and will furbish ye up a Demi God at a Minute's
Warning, for a Suit of Cloaths and a long Periwig. In short,
these m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Ages, to trick up some living Scoundril of Quality with
their Merit; which execrable Flattery Men of Sense despise, as
they ought to do the grossest Affront. 'Tis some Consolation to
the few righteous and honest Friends of the Muses, that these
fawning Slaves are often bilk'd in their Expectations, and that
People have more Guts in their Brains than to part with their
Money for a few nauseous Complements. Even our Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
have found out the Trick to give them nothing, and yet
give them no Occasion to complain of them. Some will cry to
them, <hi>The God of Verse protect and bless you in all your Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings.</hi>
Another will treat them with as much Ceremony as
they wou'd a Foreign Ambassador, and wait upon them down
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:53808:292"/>
to the very Street; that is to say, see them fairly out of their
House. Some again pay them in the currant Coin of <hi>

giving them Incense back again for Incense, and Flattery
for Flattery; but the Devil of a Lord of 'em all will invite
them to Dinner, and this is enough to make a poor Author
hang himself in his Garret. For this hungry Wre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ch, that
flatter'd himself in the Morning, that he should cram his Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

himself most nicely at an Eating-House, at the Expence of his
Magnificent Patron, is forc'd to return Home to his Quarters
poorer than he went out, with being at the Charge of binding
his Dedication, Book in Vellom or Turkey-Leather. Then he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims,
as hard as he can drive, at the horrid Ingratitude of the
Age, or at the starving Planet he was born under, according as
he his more of the Poet or Orator in him. I forgot to tell you,
Right worshipful <hi>Guillemette,</hi> that our Authors, are sometimes
pay'd by way of Exchange, in the very same Commodity they
brought with them, and receive no other Reward for all the fine
Complements they pass upon their Patron, than an Epistle for
an Epistle, or a Sonnet for a Sonnet: Our Persons of Quality
pretend they learnt this Piece of Conduct of the Emperor <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus;</hi>
but this is a Trick that is not to be play'd Twice with
People, who are so sharp as our Authors generally are. I have
therefore presum'd to dedicate my Book to your Ladyship for
the above-mention'd Reasons, or perhaps for others that I have
no mind to let you know. I already fancy with my self, that
I see you grawing the Strings of my Book, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>umbling it
about, and tearing it in a Thousand Frolicksome Postures,
which please me infinitely more, than the cold Reception of a
Supercilious Lord, that won't so much as thank me for the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
I make him, because he thinks I have the Impudence to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
another from him. Accursed be that Poet, say I, tho' he
was never so much a Master of his Profession, who first prosti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
the Productions of his Brain to this infamous <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> and
baited his Dedications with Flattery, to make the Court-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>udge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
swallow them the easier! Ever since our Authors have set
up the noble Trade of begging in Prose and Verse, an Epistle
Dedicatory has been looked upon to be a sort of a Challenge;
and if <hi>Maecenas</hi> is not able to put by the Thrust, he reckons
the Man that brings it to be no better than a Pick-Pocket, of
Highway-Man, that bids him deliver. Tho' an Author presents
his Trash to his Patron with a smiling Countenance, yet the other
looks as musty as a breaking Merchant when a thundring Bill is
drawn upon him; nay, some of them have been observ'd to
look as pale as a Ghost, at the very sight of a Book that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:53808:292"/>
them nothing less than Immortality. Well, those wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Dedicators of Books are most impudent Raskals, to haunt
those Noble Lords, even in their Chambers, and put them in
bodily Fear, as they do. They should consider, that these
cringing Epistles, which ask where nothing i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> due, are really
as much to be dreaded as an Execution upon Coach and Six: so
that for my part, I don't at all wonder if 'tis not so much Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
to see his Genealogy derived in a direct Line from <hi>Hector</hi> or
<hi>Sarpedon,</hi> as 'tis a Mortification to him to part with his Guineas,
to buy the Author a new Drugget-Suit. However, I must
needs own, that 'tis wisely done of our Authors, not to walk
the Streets in all those Trappings, wherein we find them at the
Frontispiece of their Books. For tell me, dear <hi>Guillemette,</hi>
wou'd not your Ladyship fall a barking most inordinately,
shou'd you see a Man with one Shoulder bare, and t'other wrapt
up in humble Drugget, and a Crown of Lawrel upon his Head.
Yet 'tis neither the fear of Dogs, nor the hollowing of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
that makes them decline this Equipage, for they are only
afraid of the surly Fellow at the Nobleman's Gate. Did they
not take this Course, the Porter wou'd know them, who hates
such as break in upon his own Trade, and beg as he does, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
at this time of Day, when one wou'd think our Authors
had bound themselves by an Oath, never to set Foot within an
House that does not belong to a Man of Quality. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else hardly to be seen in the Palaces of our great Men, but
a Showl of half-starv'd Creditors in one Corner of the Hall,
and half a Dozen Mendicant Rhimers in the other; so that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
how the Affairs goat present, I am afraid that we shall
shortly see as many of them in our Hospitals, unless the Times
mend, as wou'd be sufficient to set up a compleat Academy: For
alas! the World is not so favourable to them as it has been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly.

of them all; for which, dear <hi>Guillemette,</hi> I must highly commend
them, for their Fancy was so warm and all that, that it made
their Heads sweat most excessively. Some of them had
Silver Spurs, and some kept a pad Nag, with all its Accoutr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to keep the Dirt from their Boots. But at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
writing, both the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="64" facs="tcp:53808:293"/>
Dirty, and some of our Poets have abdicated <hi>Parnassus</hi> for
good and all, while others have fallen in with the Players and
Booksellers. Whether it be, that <hi>Necessity is the Mother of
Invention,</hi> or, that Invention is an essential part of a Poet, some
of our high flown Writers were for making Friends in the
Treasury, and applied themselves to those worthy Gentlemen,
that part with their Money as easily as they get it. I make no
question but that these Poetical Merchants were so profuse, as
to bestow all manner of Vertues, nay even the Military ones
too, when their Hands were in, on these liberal Publicans, and
at least derived their Pedigree from him that was Privy-Purse
to <hi>Clodion the Hairy;</hi> or, because he was a Pagan by Religion,
from the Nephew of King <hi>Clovis</hi>'s First Almoner. But these
Politicks, as I have been inform'd, only succeeded with those,
whose Works had been always received with Universal Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause,
while other poor Rogues, that were such Fools as to
imitate them, only got a good Dinner among these Sons of
Mammon, for their Pains, and perhaps a Surfeit afterwards for
eating too greedily. There needs no more Wit than what
your Ladyship is Mistress of, I mean than what belongs to a
Dog, to tell me that I have practis'd what I condemn in others.
'Tis true indeed, dear <hi>Guillemette,</hi> that I made bold to Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
a Play to a Person of great Merit and Quality; but 'tis as
true, that I had the Honour to be acquainted long before that
with Mons. <hi>le Baillif de Souvray,</hi> and always respected him, both
because he deserves it, and because he is my particular Friend.
'Tis my Misfortune that I am one of those unlucky Men who
are easily forgotten. when they are not seen. And if our most
incomparable Queen is still pleas'd to continue me the Pensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which the Mare<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

'tis not because I have now and then been so happy as to divert her
with my Poetry; but because I am the most miserable Wretch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live,
and afflicted with a cruel Distemper, which will not terminate
but with my Life, no more than a confounded Law-Suit, on which
my little All depends. This of itself is sufficient, without being pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess'd
with the Devil of Love, to hinder a Man from sleeping, unless
he took his Hat full of Opium before he went to Bed. But 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
for my good Humour to maintain its Ground much lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
against these melancholy Thoughts, that drop so unseasonably
from my Pen, and now begin to seize me. Thus, dear <hi>Guillemette,</hi>
being weary of sitting with you so long, I must e'en conclude my
Dedication abruptly, without puzzling my Brains to present you
with some notable Complement at parting, and remain in the
common Form,</p>
