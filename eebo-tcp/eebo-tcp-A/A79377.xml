            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Honourable the Lords and Commons now aſſembled in the High Court of Parliament.</head>
            <head>The humble Petition of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity of Cambridge</head>
            <p>HUmbly preſenteth to your Honourable conſideration the ſad dejected eſtate of the ſaid Univerſity: How our Schools daily grow deſolate, mourning the abſence of their Profeſſours and the wonted Auditories: How in our Colledges our numbers grow thinne, and our Revenues ſhort, and that ſubſiſtence we have abroad is for the moſt part involved in the common miſeries: How frighted by the neighbour noiſe of War, our Students either quit their Gowns, or abandon their Studies: How our Degrees lie diſeſteemed, and all hopes of our publick Commencement are blaſted in the bud, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides ſundry other preſſing inconveniences which We forbear to mention.</p>
            <p>We cannot but conceive your Honourable piety (out of a Noble zeal to Learning) will cordially pity our ſad condition, and (as the preſent generall calamities give way) afford us ſome ſuccour and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement. Your Wiſdomes beſt know what Priviledges and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities have been in all good times afforded to the ſeats of Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and the Profeſſors of it; and even in the fury and heat of War, places of Religion and Devotion have uſually not onely (on both ſides) been ſpared from ruine, but ſupported, and eſteemed as San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuaries. Hence is it that the Members of our Univerſity (by Charter confirmed by Act of Parliament) ſtand expreſſely freed from all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations and contributions to War: Hence is it, that in neighbour Territories, where the Exciſe is moſt in uſe, the Univerſities with all their Students are exempt.</p>
            <p>May it not therefore be diſpleaſing to your pious wiſdomes, if in al humility we crave at your hands a tender commiſeration of our caſe, that you will be pleaſed to exempt our poore eſtates from all ſuch Rates and Impoſitions; to vouchſafe ſuch freedome to our perſons (not giving juſt offence) as may enable us the better to keep toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and daily to offer up our joynt prayers to God for a bleſſed union betwixt our Gracious Soveraigne and you, and the bleſſing of peace upon the Land.</p>
