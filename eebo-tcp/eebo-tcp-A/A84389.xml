            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

and correſpondency with their deluding Spirits, and taking and obſerving all opertunities of advantage for accompliſhing their bloody deſigns, in a ſecreet &amp; obſcure manner, they ſent divers Letters of advice and counſel from one to the other at ſeveral places, which was to give them notice that on Munday laſt (at the time when his Majeſty ſhould be at <hi>Windſor</hi> according to his Majeſties Anceſtors cuſtome) they ſhould unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſly meet to carry on their work by violence of the Sword, but Gods great mercy attending his Majeſty and this poor Nation, providentially gave foreknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge thereof to his Majeſty and Counſel, to prevent the ſame, his Majeſty Counſelled with God in his prayers and meditations, and afterwards according to Gods Decree and his Honorable Counſels advice and ſerious judgment, he ſent his ſpecial Warrant to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine all ſuſpicious Houſes for Papers, Letters &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The which was accordingly executed in ſeveral Houſes by one of the Lord General <hi>Monks</hi> Captains, with his Officers and Souldiers, and to their ſatisfaction divers Letters were taken which were received from ſeveral perſons of great concernment, and large returns in folio of moſt horrid counſel, their ſeditious Sects in all places both neer and remote, the perſons having them in cuſtodywere immediatly ſecured, but to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proſecute their good ſucceſs and future hopes of timely preventing their curſed atcheivments, the noble Captain made it his next only buſineſs to go to <hi>New-Gate</hi> were very many and dangerous perſons are toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and therefore thought that there they ſhould be better ſatisfied and obtain a further and more ample

            <p>About three of the Clock, at which time they were at the height of their pretended Devotion in ſeveral Roomes and corners of the Houſe, at which convention the Captain judged it the beſt opportunity to go up. He demanded the Keepers to admitt him and his aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance up, by ſhewing them his authority and intent, of his loving the perſon. Who was firſt acquainted with the buſineſs and the authority thereof was Mr. <hi>Knolls,</hi> a Priſoner ſpeaker to the Anabaptiſts, who civilly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted to ſhew what Letters &amp; Papers he had in his Cuſtody, but contrary to the civillity uſed to him, he inſollently diſobeyed his Majeſties Warrant, and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently reſiſted the ſearch both by his hands &amp; Tongue, firſt crying out to his aſſociats that they ſhould ſecure the Keepers and take away the Keys, Mr. <hi>Hicks</hi> a Turnkey would moderatly have pacified and ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally diſcuſt the inconveniency that would but follow like a head-ſtrong people void of reaſon, carried him up the ſtaires upon the leads, and had not his much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaty preſerved him, they had imediately threw him off into the Street; ſome others in the intrim beat one of the Keepers, threw him down Staires, took away the Keys and kept them; others were upon one

of the Turnkeys who was baſely miſuſed, And had not ſome pirſoners that lay for Debt ſecured him, they had certainly ended his daies by a Stab, their mallice was ſo invetterate towards him, however with one voice they all cryed lets through the Rogue off from the leads. The Captaine in the time of this hurly burly was below, expecting a civill reply of his Demandes, but notice being given him by the uproares he with his Sword drawn aſſiſted by another Turnkey who at that punct of time came with the Right Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipfull Sheriff <hi>Boulton</hi> to ſee the Warrant Executed hearing of their perverneſs to it, they went to Squench the fire whilſt it was in its begining that though they ſaw them appear &amp; the Sheriff comanded Mr <hi>Knowlls</hi> to go down into his Chamber, and obey his Majeſties Orders, yet ſtill they perſiſted in their folly, by ſecuring the Captain in their own Chamber, and forcibly <hi>Knowlls</hi> laid hands on Mr. <hi>Lowman</hi> with a great Stick as if it were purpoſely prepared, and the reſt of his Companions ſeized themſelves upon other, but Mr. <hi>Lowman</hi> being not at all daunted with the aſſiſtance of his Priſoners, by degrees overpowered them, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards for preſent puniſhment he committed <hi>Iohn Smith</hi> into the Hoale (who is a convicted perſon for the late Murder committed by the inſurrection in <hi>Broad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreet)</hi> and was one of the moſt violent in the Houſe being deſirous by his attempts to have ſtopt Mr. <hi>Low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> Breath by laying his cruel mercileſs, and bloody hands upon his throat.</p>

            <p>But finding their plots were diſcovered and their hopes fruſtrated of their deſired ends which ſhould have been brought forth the next day. Then to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve their decaying reputation, and reſpects and good words amongſt the common people, they ſuddainly ſent their meſſengers abroad to make complaint firſt, to have their guilt ſeem leſs.</p>
