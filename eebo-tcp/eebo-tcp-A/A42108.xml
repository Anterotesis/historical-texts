            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>AS to the following Catalogue, I have some things to say, of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Names, Descriptions, Figures, and Uses of Particulars, and the Quotations I have made therein.</p>
                  <p>As to the first, I like not the reason which <hi>Aldrovandus</hi> gives for his beginning the History of <hi>Quadrupeds</hi> with the Horse; <hi>Quòd prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipuam nobis utilitatem praebeat.</hi> Being better placed according to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of their Approximation, to Humane Shape, and one to another: and so other Things, according to their Nature. Much less should I choose, with <hi>Gesner,</hi> to go by the Alphabet. The very Scale of the Creatures, is a matter of high speculation.</p>
                  <p>As to the Names, where they were wanting, (which in our own Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage were many) I have taken leave to give them. But have generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teind them, where I have found them all-ready given. Although, from some distinguishing Note less convenient; as the Colour is, than the Figure. And sometimes very Improper, as <hi>Concha Persica,</hi> and the like, from the Place. For it often falls out, that the same Thing breeds in many Places. But there is no Natural Reason, why it should be called by one, rather than another. So that the Names of Things should be always taken from some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more observably declarative of their Form, or Nature. The doing of which, would much facilitate and Improve the Knowledge of them many ways. For so, every Name were a short Definition. Where as if Words are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd, little else can be distinctly learn'd. Yet I took it not to be my part, actually to reform this matter; unless I had been writing an Universal Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Nature.</p>
                  <p>In the Descriptions, I have taken care; First, to rectifie the mistakes of such as are given us by other Hands. Secondly, not to Transcribe any; as is too commonly done: but having noted something more especial therein, to refer to the Author. Thirdly, where there is no Description at all, or that is too short, or the faults therein many, to give one at large. For the doing of all which, what the trouble of comparing Books together hath been, I say with <hi>Sleydan</hi> in another Case, <hi>Post Deum Immortalem Ipse novi.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the Descriptions given, I have observed, with the Figures of Things, also their Colours; so far as I could, unless I had view'd them Living, and Fresh. And have added their just Measures. Much neglected by Writers of Natural History.</p>
                  <p>If any object against their length: perhaps they have not so well considered the necessity hereof, for the cleer and evident distinction of the several Kinds and Species, in so great a variety of Things known in the World. And wherein also regard is to be had, to all that after Ages may discover, or have occasion to enquire after. The Curiosity and Diligence of <hi>Pliny,</hi> is highly to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended. Yet he is so brief, that his Works are rather a <hi>Nomenclature,</hi> than a History: which perhaps might be more intelligible to the Age he lived
<pb facs="tcp:47321:5"/>
in, than the succeeding ones. But had He, and Others, been more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular in the Matters they treat of: their Commentators had engaged their own and their Readers Time much better, than in so many fruitless and end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Disquisitions and Contests. It were certainly a Thing both in it self Desirable, and of much Consequence; To have such an Inventory of Nature, wherein, as on the one hand, nothing should be Wanting; so nothing Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated or Confounded, on the other. For which, there is no way without a cleer and full Description of Things.</p>
                  <p>Besides, that in such Descriptions, many Particulars relating to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Use of Things, will occur to the Authors mind, which otherwise he would never have thought of. And may give occasion to his Readers, for the consideration of many more. And therefore it were also very proper, That not only Things strange and rare, but the most known and common amongst us, were thus describ'd. Not meerly, for that what is common in one Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, is rare in another: but because, likewise, it would yield a great aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of matter for any Man's Reason to work upon. He that notes, That a Grey hound hath pricked Ears, but that those of a Hound hang down; may also the Reason of both: for that the former hunts with his <hi>Ears;</hi> the the latter, only with his <hi>Nose:</hi> So that as a blind Man, minds nothing but what he Hears: so a Hound, having his Ears half <hi>Stop'd</hi> with the Flaps, minds nothing but what he Smells. He that shall observe, That a Horse, which ought to have many and strong Teeth, and large and thick Hoofes, hath no Horns: and that an Ox, with Horns, hath fewer Teeth, and weaker Hoofs: cannot but at the same time see the Providence of Nature, In disposing of the same Excrementitious parts of the Blood, either way, as is most suitable to the Animal. One that considers the Teeth of a Horse, sees the reason, why he hath so long an upper Lip; which is his Hand, and in some sort answers to the <hi>Proboscis</hi> of an Elephant; whereby he nimbly <hi>winds</hi> the Grass in great quantities at once into his Mouth. So that for Nature to have made him a short Lip, had been to make a little <hi>Hopper,</hi> to a great <hi>Mill.</hi> The same Animal having need of great Lungs, how necessary is it also for him to have a broad Breast, well bowed Ribs, and wide Nostrils to give them play? That being much pester'd with Flys, he should have a long brush Tail to whisk them off. Whereas the Ass, which either for the hardness and dryness of his Skin, or other Cause, is less anoy'd with them, hath no need of such an one. That being heavy, he should not Tread or Leap stiff, as a Man; but have a Pastern made him, gradually and safely to break the force of his weight. By This, his Body hangs on the Hoof, as a Coach doth by the Leathers. Without this, the most thorow pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>'d Horse, would tread so hard, that as it were impossible for any man to endure long upon his Back: so his Joynts would be much chafed, and he must needs presently tyre. Yet if it be too long, by yielding over much, it makes every step somewhat more laborious, and to loose some ground. He that would have one for Carriage, will choose him short, and high Back'd. For Runing, long, an clean or slender Limb'd: another, were like a Man that should run a Race in his Boots. And a due length is as necessary: which is, when the Measure be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Main and the Tail answers to the hight, or thereabout. If much under, his hinder Feet will want their full scope: if much over, there will be more weight to be moved with the same force, as if the weight were less. But he that would have one for Draught, looks not that the Limbs be slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, if they are strong; especially those behind. For though the fore Legs
<pb facs="tcp:47321:5"/>
pull sometimes, most when they make an acute angle with the Belly; yet the greatest stress usually lies upon the hinder; these being as the Centre of Gravity, and the Load, and Body of the Horse, the two Counter Weights. And when he Goes without Drawing, his fore Feet only support him; but his hinder, serve also as Leavers to carry him on. And therefore when he walks, he always moves his hinder Foot first.</p>
                  <p>Together with such Notes as these, arising from the Description of the <hi>outward Parts;</hi> how largely and usefully might that of the <hi>Inner;</hi> his Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, Breeding and the like, be also insisted on. And so the like of other Animals. Whereby a better History of them might be written in five years, than hath hitherto been done in two Thousand.</p>
                  <p>As for the Figures, I have given only those of such particulars, as are omitted by others. Saving one or two, found in some Authors less known, or common. Nor any, but what is also describ'd: which makes any further Explication of these needless, besides what the Reader will find next before them.</p>
                  <p>After the Descriptions; instead of medling with Mystick, Mythologick, or Hieroglyphick matters; or relating Stories of Men who were great Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, or Women that were bold and feared not Horses; as some others have done: I thought it much more proper, To remarque some of the Uses and Reasons of Things. Where also for the sake of the English Reader, I have undergone the transcribing some particulars. More I could have done, with less trouble. These I hope will compensate the room, they take up. Amongst Medicines, I have thought fit to mention the Virtues of divers Exoticks. Because the greatest Rarity, if once experienced to be of good use, will soon become common. The Jesuites Barque, of which, no Man yet hath well describ'd the Tree, and very few know precisely where it grows; yet what great quantity, doth the much use of it bring over to us? Unicorns Horns, upon the like motive of Trade, would be as plentiful as Elephants Teeth.</p>
                  <p>I have made the Quotations, not to prove things well known, to be true; as one <note n="*" place="margin">Aldrovandus.</note> (and he too deservedly esteemed for his great Diligence and Curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity) who very formally quotes <hi>Aristotle,</hi> to prove a Sheep to be amongst the <hi>Bisulca: Ovem, (inquit) ex genere esse Bisulcorum, non solùm</hi>

                        <p>AN AEGYPTIAN MUMMY given by the Illustrious Prince <hi>Henry</hi> Duke of <hi>Norfolk.</hi> It is an entire one taken out of the Royal Pyramids. In length five feet and ½, defended with several linnen Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, all woven like ordinary Flaxen Cloth. But by the spinning, distinguished into three kinds. The utmost, is like Flaxen Cloth of two shillings an Ell: the inmost, of half a Crown: the middlemost, of three shillings, or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about.</p>
                        <p>The utmost Cover is divided into several pieces, each of doubled Linnen, and adapted in figure to the part it covers,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:47321:8"/>
as one on the Breast, another on the Belly, and so on all the principal Parts. On each of these pieces is laid a white Paint, of a kind of chalky or limy substance, of the thickness of a Hen-Egg-shell. Upon this chalky ground are drawn the Hieroglyphick Figures of Men, Women and Birds; in Gold, yellow, red and blew. But with very rude shapes, and the Colours no where mixed together. So very mean was the Art of Painting amongst the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore. For we have reason to believe, that what was done for one of their Kings or Nobles, was done with their best skill.</p>
                        <p>The middlemost Cover consisteth of one single and entire piece of Linnen, almost like a Winding-sheet. It is also tinged with some kind of Paint, but very lightly, and without any Figures.</p>
                        <p>The inmost Covering is wrapped round about the Head, Trunk, each Arm, and each Leg apart, about thirty or forty times, like so many swathing Bands. About twenty of the utmost of these folds are lightly tinged, all the other inmost more fully, with a blackish and gummous substance. But the Flesh so fully, as it seems to be converted into a black Rosin; which being held to the flame of a Candle, is a little odorous and inflamable. The Bones also, are not only outwardly, but also quite through of a black colour, as if they were burnt.</p>
                        <p>From hence it is very probable, That the way of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balming amongst the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> was by boiling the Body (in a long Cauldron like a Fish-kettle) in some kind of liquid Balsome; so long, till the aqueous parts of the flesh being evaporated, the oily and gummous parts of the Balsome did by degrees soak into it, and intimately incorporate there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. Much after the same manner, as the Sugar doth, in the conditing of Pears, Quinces, and the like.</p>
                        <p>'Tis also likely, that a better way might be taken, than this used by the <hi>Aegyptians.</hi> And that is, by boyling, or rather soaking the Body in some white sort of Oyl, and such as will dry, (as that of Walnuts) made and kept so hot, as to evaporate the watery parts by degrees, and to keep the flesh white, and not brittle, but limber and plient. Which, especially in the business of Anatomy, would be of good use: because, that all the Muscules of the Body,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:47321:8"/>
being first parted one from another, might hereby be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served sound, clean, and limber upon the Bones; and so all the motions of the parts be explicated with the greatest ease, and without any offensiveness.</p>
                        <p>'Tis equally probable, that the whole Compages of the Muscules, as they lie upon the Bones, might with little trouble, and less charge than by the former way, be truly Tanned, or reduced to a limber sort of Leather; whereby also the westage of the fibers, or other mechanisme of the Muscules might more easily and leisurely be observed. For the skins of Beasts, whereof Leather is daily made, are Muscular; and in mans body consisteth, for the most part, of the same carneous fibers, as the Muscules, but more closely woven or matted together.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Mummy,</hi> saith <hi>Wormius</hi> 
                           <note n="a" place="margin">Musaeum Wormia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num.</note> (and so most Writers here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of) is of great use against Contusions, clodded Blood, Hard Labour, &amp;c. But let them see to it, that dare trust to old Gums, which have long since lost their virtue.</p>

                        <p>A MALE HUMANE FOETUS. Given by <hi>Thomas Cox</hi> 
                           <abbr>Esq</abbr> An Abortive of about the <hi>4th</hi> Month. In length five inches. The Head, from the hinder part to the face, an Inch and ½. The Face, an Inch and ¼. The Back, from shoulder to shoulder, an Inch and ¾ broad. The Buttocks an Inch. The Arms and Thighs ½ Inch over. The Wrist and small of the Leg, ¼ of an Inch.

                           </gap> of an Inch; twisted like a Rope; and cut off five Inches long. The Eyes shut. But the Mouth open. It hath neither Nails, nor Hair. The Skin white and smooth, almost as in Children newly born. See Dr. <hi>W. Needham</hi>'s curious Book <hi>de Foetu Formato.</hi> 
                           <note n="c" place="margin">And <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bokenus</hi>'s <hi>Anatomia Secundinae Humanae.</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p>The largeness of the Head and Chest, with respect to the other parts, is observable. The mouth being open, shews that the <hi>Foetus,</hi> even in the <hi>4th</hi> Month, may that way take part of its Aliment. <note n="d" place="margin">See Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey de Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerat. Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malium.</note> The Skin hath been kept white and smooth for so long a time, <hi>scil.</hi> above fifteen years, by being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded with rectified spirit of Wine in a Cylindrical Glass; to the middle of which the <hi>Foetus</hi> is poised, by means of a
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:47321:9"/>
Glass Buble of an Inch diametre, the Neck whereof is fastned to the <hi>Anus</hi> of the <hi>Foetus</hi> by a wyer.</p>
                        <p>The entire SKIN of a MOOR. 'Tis tanned with the Hair of the Head, and even the smallest in all the other parts remaining on it.</p>
                        <p>Herein are observable, the Fibers in the skin of the <hi>Penis,</hi> which are very white, and exquisitely small, like the thread of a Spiders Web. Likewise the thinness of the true Cutis in the sole of the Foot; and on the contrary, the extraordinary thickness of the <hi>Cuticula,</hi> especially in the Heel, exceeding the sixth part of an Inch: which is about fifty times the thickness of that in the ball of the Hand. <hi>Bartholine</hi> 
                           <note n="a" place="margin">Historiar. Cent. 5.</note> mentions a <hi>Farrier</hi> who had several Callo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities on his Right-Hand Fingers, as big as Walnuts.</p>
                        <p>The same Author <note n="b" place="margin">Historiar. Cent. 3.</note> shews the way of tanning a Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Skin. I believe it may be tann'd by all the ways which are us'd upon other Skins.</p>
                        <p>He saith, <note n="c" place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                           <hi>That a Thong hereof ty'd about the middle, is of good use for facilitating the Birth; and especially against Mother-Fits.</hi> Whether any other way, if so, than by raising and fortifying the phancy (which will sometimes produce strange effects) I leave to the Reader to judge.</p>
                        <p>All the Principal VEINS, ARTERIES, and NERVES, both of the <hi>Limbs</hi> and <hi>Viscera.</hi> The ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous Gift of <hi>John Evelyn</hi> Esquire. He bought them at <hi>Padoa,</hi> where he saw them with great industry and exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness (according to the best method then used) taken out of the body of a Man, and very curiously spread upon four large TABLES, whereon they are now preserved. The Work of <hi>Fabritius Bartoletus</hi> then <hi>Vestingius</hi>'s Assistant there, and afterwards Physician to the King of <hi>Poland.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>Veins</hi> and <hi>Arteries</hi> are so exceedingly well done, as to shew the most curious Schemes which <hi>Laurentius</hi> and other Physitians have given us of them, are real and not fictitious. But the <hi>Nerves</hi> have been much more truly and fully represented to us of late by Dr. <hi>Richard Lower,</hi> in Dr. <hi>Willis.</hi>

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:47321:9"/>
have been the first, who to any purpose, observed the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stribution of the <hi>Sanguineous Vessels.</hi> Yet he describes them only from the Heart <hi>upward.</hi> Nor makes he any distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on betwixt the <hi>Vena Portae,</hi> and the <hi>Vena Cava.</hi> So that even here he comes far short of that exactness which Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomists have since arrived at; as appears, upon inspecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by the TABLES above mention'd.</p>
                        <p>The SCELETON of a Man. Wherein the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Bones (about two hundred and fifty) together with their dimensions, figures, and articulations are all easily observable. Given by <hi>Thomas Povey</hi> Esquire.</p>
                        <p>The History of the Bones, as finished, is well perform'd by most Anatomists. But the manner, and order of their beginning and perfection, hath been given us, so far as I know, by the diligent Observations of <hi>Kirckringius</hi> 
                           <note n="a" place="margin">Kirck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringii Osteo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logia.</note> only.</p>
                        <p>Of all Humane Bones indifferently, as well as of the Skull, are prepared, <hi>Spiritus simplicior, Spiritus oleosus, Oleum rectificatum, &amp; Magisterium.</hi> Amongst which, the <hi>spiritus oleosus,</hi> if well prepared, is of undoubted use against <hi>Hyste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical Passions;</hi> and in some other <hi>Cases,</hi> where the <hi>Nerves</hi> especially are <hi>affected.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The SCELETON of a Woman; of equal height with the former. By comparing these two together, it may be noted, That the <hi>Os Ilium</hi> is larger and more out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in the Female Sceleton, than in the Male; <hi>sc.</hi> for the more easie Labour, as <hi>Bartholine</hi> and others have also observed by the like comparison. I add, That the same Bone is also broader by ½ an Inch in the Female Sceleton, than in the Male: <hi>sc.</hi> for the better sustentation of the <hi>Foetus</hi> in the Womb. Again, That the <hi>Os Sacrum</hi> is half an Inch longer in the Female: both for the forementioned reason, and also the better proportion of the Parts. On the contrary, That the <hi>Vertebrae,</hi> especially of the <hi>Loyns,</hi> are much broader, thicker, and stronger in the Male Scele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, than in the Female; being hereby better fitted for the bearing of burthens. And, that as in the Male Sceleton there are 32 Teeth, as is usual, and in the Female but 28; So the nether Chap in the Male Sceleton is half an Inch broader than in the Female, as being made to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate a bigger Muscule for the motion of those
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:47321:10"/>
Teeth. And for the same reason, the Angles subjected to the <hi>Os Jugale</hi> are above ½ an Inch more distant; For that a Man being fitted, in other respects, to undergo more labour; his Chaps also should be the better made to eat the more. Once more, That the Skull of the Male Sceleton, is much bigger, than of the Female; and so ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of more Brains. Although a little House may be well furnished, and look better than a great one that stands empty.</p>
                        <p>The SCELETON of an Abortive Humane <hi>Foetus.</hi> 'Tis not above two Inches long. The parts of the Head, Chest, and Limbs are all entire, but not perfect. For the extremities of the Bones of the Arms and Leggs, are at both ends plainly cartilagineous. They are in thickness like a Taylors stitching Thread. Given by <hi>Thomas Povey</hi> 
                           <abbr>Esq</abbr>. See <hi>Kirckringius de Foetûs Ossibus.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It may possibly be conceived by some, That the Bones, at least some of them, are hard at the first; as Salts and other like Crystallizing Bodies are as hard upon the very first instant of their shooting, as they are when grown into great Crystals. But it is so far evident, that all the Bones are soft at the first, that I am of opinion, That originally they are a <hi>Congeries</hi> of <hi>Fibers</hi> or fibrous Vessels, as true as any other in the Body; which by degrees harden into Bones: even as the inmost Vessels in a Plant, do in time harden into Wood. <note n="a" place="margin">See the Authors A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natomy of Plants.</note> And that as in a Plant, there are successive additions of Rings or Tubes of Wood, made out of Vessels: So in an Animal, it seems plain, That there are additions successively made to the Bones out of the Fibrous parts of the Muscules; especially, those whitest Fibers which run transversly, and make the stamen or warp of every Muscule. So that as in the <hi>Barque</hi> of a Plant, part of the Vessels are successively derived outward to the <hi>Rind,</hi> and part inward to the <hi>Sap,</hi> which afterwards be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes <hi>hard wood.</hi> 
                           <note n="b" place="margin">See the Authors Compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Anatomy of Trunks.</note> So in the <hi>Flesh</hi> of an Animal, part of the <hi>white transverse Fibers</hi> are successively derived to the <hi>Skin</hi> (of which this chiefly consists) and part of them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, making still new <hi>Periosteum's</hi> one after another, as the old ones become so many additions to the <hi>Bones.</hi>

In length two Inches and a quarter. Of a Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramidal figure; with an obtuse Cone. Near the Base an Inch over. Where it hath a little Hole or Canale tending towards the Cone. When it first slipped out of the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der into the <hi>Penis,</hi> it was neither so thick or big, nor so hard, but that, as it seems, the Urine pressing forward, forced a hole for its passage through the middle of it. Which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing opened, the Stone continued fixed in the same place, <hi>viz.</hi> about an Inch behind the <hi>Glans Penis,</hi> for the space of Thirteen Years. In which time, it gradually grew bigger, till it came to the bulk above mention'd. And the said Hole or Canale being by the continual accretion of new matter, at last stop'd up, the Stone was then forced out of the end of the <hi>Penis.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This Man, in all this time, scarce felt any great Pains; neither did he omit his usual Recreations or his business. And once he took a Journey (<hi>on Horseback</hi>) from <hi>Exeter</hi>

And accordingly the <hi>Germans</hi> rightly call him <hi>Wasser-Ocks;</hi> and the <hi>Italians</hi> at <hi>Constantinople</hi> BOMARIN. The same Animal, which in the Book of <hi>Job</hi> is called <hi>BEHEMOTH;</hi> as is solidly proved by <hi>Bochart,</hi> in his <hi>Hierozoicon.</hi> He is almost every where described very falsly. <hi>Aristotle</hi> falsly gives him a Maine, like that of a Horse: deluded, 'tis likely, by the Name. <hi>Kircher</hi> 
                              <note n="d" place="margin">Chin. Illustr.</note> falsly gives him all Horse Teeth. In the <hi>Musaeum Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> he is described with double Hoofs like an <hi>Ox,</hi> and pictured with four or five Claws like a <hi>Bear;</hi> neither truly. <hi>Bellonius,</hi> who saw one alive, but yet very young, was the first that hath given any tollerable Description of him.

                           <p>His Teeth, says <hi>Columna,</hi> are so hard, that being struck against Steel, produce sparks of fire. And thence concludes it probable, That this Animal, by striking his Teeth one against another, in the night time, might produce the like, and so seem, as it were, to vomit or breath out fire; a thing attributed to him by the Ancients. But the error of this Conjecture is double: First in his not considering, That the fire (could any be produced by striking Steel against these Teeth) would be struck not out of the Teeth, but out of the Steel. And next, In that, in truth, no fire can be produced by either striking of these Teeth one against another, or against Steel it self; as I have try'd.</p>

His Head an Inch and ¼, and three Inches long. The end of his Nose scarce half an Inch over, shaped like that of a Pig; from whence I have taken leave to name it. His Ears not above ¼ of an Inch distant one from the other. His fore-foot two Inches and ½ long, above ½ Inch over. On which he hath four Toes; the two foremost of which are an Inch long, the other two ½ an Inch. The hinder-foot of equal length, but thicker. On which there are five Toes; the three foremost, and thickest whereof are an Inch long, the other two ½ an Inch. His Tail about 11 Inches long, at the Buttocks an Inch and ¼ over, at the end as small as a <hi>Shoomakers</hi> waxed Thread.</p>
                           <p>His Head, Back, Sides, Legs, and Tail, are all cover'd with a shelly Armour. His Head, with Shells, Scales for the most part, five and six angled. His Shoulders, with round ones, and lesser, about ¼ of an Inch over; betwixt which other lesser ones are interjected. The Back-piece consisteth of about ten shell Plates, joyned together by the mediation of as many parallel Skins. Every Plate is about ½ Inch broad, curiously composed of small triangular or wedge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like pieces, indented one against another, and pounced or pricked all along their edges. His Buttocks adorned in the same manner as his Shoulders. His Shell ending next his Tail, with an <hi>Elipsis.</hi> The fore-part of his Tail is encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass'd with shelly Rings, in number eleven; composed not of triangular, but sixangl'd and square pieces.

Eyes black, round, and very little; resembling a black Bead of the bigness of a Vetch. His Grinders in each Chap about twelve. More properly Tunsores; because they are level and smooth on the top. No thicker than a great Needle. Besides these Teeth, I find none.</p>

For the better performance of which action, Nature hath also left his Throath, Neck, Breast and Belly naked. As also his Ears, that he may turn them more expeditely for the reception of sounds from every quarter. His Eyes, like those of a Mole, very little, as most suitable to a Creature living for the most part in the dark, and under ground.

His Back-piece, reaching also over his Buttocks to his Tail, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed of several Plates, in number eighteen, moveably joyned together by as many intermediate Skins. The fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most and greatest of these Plates, consist of square pieces ½ Inch long, and a ¼ broad. The hindermost, of square and round ones together. The extream part of the Shell next the Tail, is Parabolick. The fore part of the Tail is sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with six Rings; consisting of little square pieces. The other half with Scals. His Breast, Belly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Ears all naked; for the same purposes, as in the former.</p>
                           <p>This <hi>Species,</hi> by the greater number of Plates, seemeth able to draw, especially his hinder parts, more roundly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, than the other.</p>

                              <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Of VIVIPAROUS QUADRUPED'S, Particularly such as are BIFIDOUS, and SOLIDIPEDOUS.</head>
                           <p>THe LEG of a GREENLAND STAG. It is scarce four Inches long. Nor above ⅓<hi rend="sup">d</hi> of an Inch over. Cover'd all over with very short hair, of the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary russet or reddish brown colour. The hoofs somewhat black, ½ inch long, ⅓ broad, and ¼ high. Given by Mr. <hi>Palmer.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The BONES of a STAGS heart. About an inch and ¼ long, and ¼ broad. Very thin, but yet hard and solid. They seem to be a help for the stronger and more steady motion of the Muscules of the heart. Butchers often find the like in the heart of an Ox; which are easily substituted for the former: and I would as soon trust the one, as the other.</p>
                           <p>A STAGS TEARS. A thicken'd Excretion from the inward Angle of his Eye. In colour and consistence almost like to Mirrh; or Ear-wax that has been long harden'd in the Ear. Of a strong stinking smell, like that of the Animal's sweat. They are generally affirmed to be sudorifick, and of an Alexipharmick nature. And if they were as easie to be had, as some Womens, it were worth the trying.</p>
                           <p>They are quite a different thing from that little round and hard Bone, which <hi>Scaliger</hi> describes <note n="a" place="margin">Exerc. 112.</note> by the Name of <hi>Lachryma Cervina,</hi> and which he affirms to grow in the great Corner of a Stags Eye to the Bone, after an hundred years old. I doubt a stranger sight, than the <hi>Ludus Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laris;</hi> such as no man (but himself) ever saw, or shall see.</p>
                           <p>The MUSK DEER. <hi>Capreolus Moschi. Gesner</hi> reckoning up the Names, tells us, That the <hi>English</hi> call him a <hi>Musk Cat.</hi> But is better at other Languages. He breeds in <hi>China,</hi> and the <hi>East Indies.</hi> Not ill pictur'd

in <hi>Calceolarius</hi>'s <hi>Musaeum.</hi> That in <hi>Kircher</hi>'s <hi>China Illustrata</hi> faulty as to the Snout and Feet. That of <hi>Johnston</hi> ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd. Almost every where worse describ'd. <hi>That he is a two-horn'd Animal, says</hi> Aldrovandus, <hi>all agree, except</hi> Simeon Sethi, <hi>who saith he hath but one.</hi> Neither of which is true. The Description likewise given by <hi>Scaliger,</hi> and out of him by <hi>Chiocco</hi> in <hi>Calceolarius</hi>'s <hi>Musaeum</hi> is false, and very defective. The best I find is amongst the <hi>German</hi> Transactions. To which I would have refer'd the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but that comparing it with That I had drawn up before I met with it, I see some differences.</p>
                           <p>From his Nose end to his Tail, a yard and ½ a foot long. His Head above ½ a foot. His Neck ¼ of a yard. His Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head three inches broad. His Nose end scarce ¾ of an inch, being very sharp, like that of a Grey-Hound. His Ears like a <hi>Coneys,</hi> about three inches long, and erect. As also his Tail or Scut, which exceeds not two inches. His fore-Leg a foot and two inches long, taking in Foot and Thigh. Near an inch over: the Foot deeply cloven; with two fore-Hoofs, an inch and ¼ long, each ¼ of an inch over; and two Heels, almost as big, and therefore conspicuous. His hinder feet are here wanting.</p>
                           <p>His hair on his Head and Legs about ½ inch long, and rateably small. On his Belly an inch and ½ long, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what thicker. On his Back and Buttocks three inches long: thicker in proportion, than in any other Animal, except perhaps some of the Deer kind, <hi>sc.</hi> three or four times as thick as Hogs Bristles: consisting of brown and white porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons alternately from the Root to the top. On the Head and Legs, brown; On the Belly and under the Skut, whitish. As it were frizled, especially on the Back and Belly, by a kind of undulation. Softer than in most Animals, and exceeding light and rare. For being split, and view'd with a Glass, they appear to be made up of little Bladders, like those in the Plume or Stalk of a Quill: so that it is a thing betwixt a common Hair and a Quill. On each side his lower Chap, almost under the corners of his mouth, there is a peculiar Tuft (about ¾ of an inch long) of short, thick and hard hairs, or rather Bristles, of equal length, as in a scrub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Brush.</p>
                           <p>The Musk Bladder or Bag is about three inches long,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:47321:18"/>
two over, and swelling out from his Belly one and ½. Standing before his Groin about as much. I find it cut open, whereby the observation of its natural Aper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (which I suppose it hath as the Castor-Bag) is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented.</p>
                           <p>He hath 26 Teeth. In his lower Chap, sixteen; of which there are eight little Cuters before; behind, four Grinders on each side, rugged and continuous. As many like Grin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in the upper Jaw. About an inch and ½ from the Nose end, in the same Jaw, on each side a Tusk, two inches and ½ long, hooked downward, and backward, and ending in a point. Not round, but flat, the breadth of ½ an inch; thin, and having a sharp edge behind: so as it may not unfitly be liken'd to a Sithe. There are no Horns.</p>
                           <p>The Hair of this Animal, by its softness and rarity, are a singular contrivance of Nature to keep him warm. For all Garments, the softer and rarer they are, (<hi>caet. par.</hi>) they are the warmer. For the same cause, the Hair on his Back, is also the longest; <hi>sc.</hi> for the better protection of the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalis Medulla,</hi> His two Tusks, by the Figure, appear to serve for fighting partly, and partly for feeding; by the help whereof he is able either to stub up edible Roots out of the ground, or to tear off the Barques, or break down the Boughs of Trees. By the help of his great Ears, he hears his approaching enemy the further off, to make his flight. So also the <hi>Hare,</hi> being a fearful Animal, hath the like. Nature hath furnished him with great heels, both to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able him to make the greater leaps, and to light also upon his Feet the more safely, for by their means, the force of his weight is gradually broken.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Scaliger</hi>'s mistakes <note n="a" place="margin">Exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tat. 21.</note> about this Animal, are principally these two; In saying his Tusks grow out of his nether Jaw; and in calling the Musk, A postemated Blood. For he might as well call Civet and Castor the Blood of those Animals that yield them. And if it were apostemated, it would not be separated from the Flesh, but contiguous to it: whereas it is plain, that the Musk was here inclosed on all sides, in an entire Cystis or Bag made by nature for that purpose.</p>
                           <p>The VELVET HORNES of a <hi>Greenland Roe-Buck.</hi>

So strangely does the Climat alter the Bulk of some Animals. Dear, and they only, may be suppos'd to cast their horns, because they have neither a long Tail, as Oxen; nor so long hair as a Goat or a Ram; by either of which is made a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual consumption of the same matter, which in Deer goes into the horns. The horns of Deer, are of all other the fullest of Volatile Salt. Which may lead us to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture of the like nature of his flesh, and blood; and the cause of his great salacity.</p>

To whose also the hornes here preserved are like in colour, and somewhat near in shape: but nothing near so big; being not much above two inches long.

Consist of four Branches: The two greater whereof are a foot long, and as thick as an ordinary Rams, very strait, standing in the form of the letter V, or like the legs of a pair of Compasses, and a little writhen.

See the Animal describ'd in <hi>Bellonius,</hi> and others. He is much bigger than the <hi>Europaean</hi> Bull. This kind breeds most in <hi>Asia.</hi> But they are also kept in <hi>Italy,</hi> in their Cities. In <hi>India</hi> they sell the Milk of the Female about the streets, as they do Cows Milk here.

The skin of any Bulls Forehead, either for its toughness, or other cause, is the only part of the Hyde made use of by <hi>Horners,</hi> whereupon they shave their Hornes (which they take out of a Tub of warm water by them) to fit them for <hi>Lamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horns.</hi>

But of his fault in affirming too generally, this Animal is not the only instance, by many. The reason why this hath both, may be, because neither of them are very great, and his Horns, proportionably to what they are in others, are very little. Besides that he is cover'd with hair, and not, as the Boar, with Bristles, which probably spend more up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the same matter, which in other Creatures makes the Horns.

                           <p>The SKIN of a young RHINOCEROS, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed indifferently to the shape of the Animal. In the Description whereof <hi>Jacobus Bontius</hi> 
                              <note n="b" place="margin">Histor. Nat. Ind. Orient.</note> comes the nearest to the truth. Yet is he very short and defective. To whose therefore, as far as may be by this Skin, I shall add a better.</p>
                           <p>'Tis a yard long, and almost a foot over; his head nine inches long, almost eight over at the top. His Snout broadish, as in a Calf. His Eyes little, as those of a Hog, about ¼ of an inch long. They stand low, not much more than three inches above his Nose end. His Ears also like a Hogs. His Legs, as of the <hi>Hippopotamus,</hi> rateably short; about ten inches long. His Tail, five and ½; flat, as that of the Castor; but not so broad, near the Buttocks an inch and ½, at the end ½ an inch.</p>
                           <p>The said Skin is every where thick, and very hard; excepting only his Ears which are softer, and extream thin. It hath about ten <hi>Plicae</hi> or Folds; two under the nether Jaw, one on the Breast, in the figure of the letter V, on the Neck one on each side, one between the Shoulders semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circular, on the Back two transversly extended to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the sides, with two more strait ones, carry'd obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quely on the Buttocks.</p>
                           <p>The lower part of the Forehead and Snout cover'd with a kind of hard Crust. His Ears naked and smooth. All the other parts rough with round scaly Crusts; on the Back, Sides, and Belly, lesser, near a ¼ of an inch over; on the nether Chap and Shoulders, bigger; on his Buttocks and Legs, the biggest, about ½ an inch over. His Hair is black, short, and fine. So few, that there are not many more than scales or shells; growing for the most part, out of the centre of the shell; so that he is almost naked. His Dock is also naked on both sides, but on the edges there grows a considerable quantity of longer and thicker Hair. The Animal being very young, had no Horn, nor so much as any sign of it.</p>

On the two edges, and there only, grow also very black and shining hairs, a foot long, stubborn, and of the thickness of a smaller <hi>Shoomakers</hi> Thread.

                           <p>Another BALL, in figure, colour, and substance, like the former; but bigger, being above three inches Diametre. It was taken out of the stomach of a Cow.</p>
                           <p>Another with the like Incrustation, but of an Oval Figure.</p>
                           <p>A FIBROUS BALL. Consisting, not of Hair, but for the most part of the fibers of Plants. Perfectly Sphaerical. An inch and ½ Diametre. Cover'd with a brown, and very rough Crust. The like substance being also mixed with the most intimate parts of the Ball.</p>
                           <p>Another like Ball, but somewhat less.</p>

of a Sheep. Two inches over, and a little flat. It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth of most fine herby Threads or Fibers, short, and very closely compacted. Cover'd with a black, shining, and most thin Cuticle. A piece hereof fired, burns like Match-cord, all away to ashes.</p>
                           <p>These Balls, especially those of Hair, we may suppose to be made by the motion of the stomach, which in these Creatures is very strong, and frequent: by which motion the Hair is wrought and compacted together, as Wooll is, by the Workmans hand, in the making of a Hat.</p>

                           <p>A Femal LAND-TORTOIS. <hi>Testudo terrestris foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mina.</hi> Usually described, but no where fully, nor without errors. This here is eight inches long, and five broad. The Head an inch and ½ long, almost as broad; in shape somewhat like a Toads. The Orbits of the Eyes very large, almost ½ inch over; a ¼ of an inch behind the Snout. The lower Chap is received by a groove into the upper. The Tail three inches long, and sharp-pointed. The Feet two inches and ¼, and above ½ inch over. The fore-Feet have five very short Toes, with Claws about ¼ inch long. The hinder feet have but four Toes, with some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what bigger Claws.</p>
                           <p>The Head, Back and Belly, have all bony Covers, faced or over-laid with shells. The head and back-pieces blackish, with citrine or straw-colour'd specks sprinkled up and down upon them. The back-piece convex, and almost Oval. On the sides, for the length of two inches as it were doubled inwards, and joyned to the Belly-piece. 'Tis cancellated with little squares on the Margin; on the top of the back, sexangularly; and with the largest <hi>Area's</hi> between. The Belly-piece is party-colour'd black and citrine, almost flat; but turned up a little at the ends. Cancellated in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with squares, with triangles before, and behind with Hyperbolick lines. The Feet are cover'd with small round Scales, the Tail with square ones. He breeds in the Deserts of <hi>Africa.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="36" facs="tcp:47321:25"/>Three little LAND-TORTOISES of the same kind.</p>
                           <p>Another little LAND-TORTOISE, of kin to the former. 'Tis somewhat rounder.</p>
                           <p>A lesser LAND-TORTOISE, almost circular and ridged on the back.</p>
                           <p>A great CHEQUERD TORTOISE-SHELL. <hi>Testa Testellata major.</hi> It was sent from <hi>Madagascar.</hi> I find the Animal no where describ'd or figur'd. It is above half oval; being of all that I ever saw, the most concave; a foot long, eight inches over, and almost six inches high.</p>
                           <p>The Convex is curiously wrought with black and whitish pieces, alternately wedged in, one against another, and notched, as it were, with transvers Incisions. Those near the Margines and on the sides are composed into several Pyramidal <hi>Area's,</hi> or great Triangles, whose Bases are about two inches broad. On the Back, into sexangular ones, each of them convex. On the sides, and quite behind, the Shell is carry'd somewhat inward. Before, and hinderly, the edges are toothed, and bended outward and upward. The inward edges are cover'd with shelly Plates above an inch and ½ broad.</p>
                           <p>The Concave is composed of six and forty Bones. Along the middle of the Back, are twelve, all, except the foremost and the four last, almost square. Next to these, are eight on each side, like to so many contiguous Ribs; together with two lesser square Bones before: Next to these, eight more, as it were, under-Ribs, on each side. To the twelve middlemost Bones, the Ribs are joyned by an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternate commissure, so as one of them answers to the halfs of two Ribs, <hi>&amp; vice versa.</hi> To these, the under-Ribs, in a wonderful manner, <hi>scil.</hi> by a branched Suture or Inden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. For the great Teeth of the under-Ribs, being first inserted into those of the upper-Ribs; the Indenture is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards repeated, by lesser Teeth, out of the sides of the great ones. The Belly-piece is here wanting.</p>
                           <p>Besides the most elegant ordering of the Work in the Convex, there are three-things chiefly observable, which serve for the greater strength of the Shell. That is to say, The <hi>Convexity</hi> of the several <hi>Area's</hi> on the Back, the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:47321:25"/>
                              <hi>branched Sutures,</hi> and the <hi>Alternate commissures</hi> of the Bones. Answerable to the Rule of Nature, in a <hi>Humane Skull:</hi> and of Art, in the laying of <hi>Stones</hi> in <hi>Buildings;</hi> and in cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of broader Vaults, not with one <hi>Arch,</hi> but several lesser ones, for the greater strength.</p>
                           <p>A lesser CHEQUER'D SHELL. Perhaps <hi>Stellata Wormii,</hi> 
                              <note n="a" place="margin">See his <hi>Musaeum.</hi>
                              </note> or a kin to it. The Convex work is compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed of black and citrine pieces, cancellated, and transversly notched; ten, eleven, or twelve of them meeting in a square, and rugged centre; each looking like a Star sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with Rays. The several <hi>Area's</hi> rise up into a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vexity somewhat greater, than in the Shell above describ'd. Just before the Tail, the edges are bended a little upward; over the Tail, downward. The Belly-piece is joyned to the Back-piece for the length of two inches and ½, with the edges turned upward. The middle of it flat, streak'd, and cancellated; the hinder part endeth in a double broad point.</p>
                           <p>Two more CHEQUER'D SHELLS of the same <hi>Species;</hi> saving, That here are not so great a number of Rays to each Star.</p>
                           <p>Another of the same; excepting, that the several arched pieces are not so high, as in the former.</p>
                           <p>A CHEQUER'D-SHELL, from <hi>Suranam.</hi> I think no where describ'd, or figur'd, unless perhaps by <hi>Moschardus.</hi> The convex work is composed of black and citrine pieces, in the Margin, of a Pyramidal or wedged Figure, oppositely set, and with <hi>transverse</hi> Notches: amongst which there are also little square, rugged, and citrine pieces intermixed. All the rest, which are also black and citrine, are six times as big, adorned not with transverse but <hi>paralell</hi> Notches. Neither are they Radiated, but several of the same kind contiguous side to side. They are compos'd into <hi>Area's</hi> almost flat: the centres whereof are also rugged, but much bigger than in the Shell last described. The Belly-piece is also less convex.</p>
                           <p>Another of the same <hi>Species.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Another CHEQUER'D SHELL from <hi>Suranam,</hi> of kin to the last describ'd. The edges of this are round about, excepting before, turn'd up outward. The Back also is less convex; the Belly, more deep.</p>
                           <p>

Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that it is more convex, and divided into <hi>Area's</hi> also somewhat convex, and with transvers Furrows or Notches. 'Tis also near the Tail, turned up outward; but the hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most part bended inward.</p>
                           <p>Another Shell of the same <hi>Species.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Another, like the first describ'd, excepting also, That it is more convex; and instead of specks, hath long streaks, and great blotches.</p>
                           <p>A SCALY TORTOISE SHELL. It seems to be of the Lutarious kind. I find it not describ'd, or figur'd. Above a foot long, ten inches broad, convex to the height of 3 ½. The convex, all along the middle, high ridg'd. Composed of Scales, very smooth, particolour'd, of a brownish red and citrine; in the utmost edge lesser, and almost square, but with acute Angles prolonged towards the Tail, and towards the Head doubled downwards. The rest are five, six, and eight times bigger, set alternately, as the Scales in Fishes, or Slate-work upon a house. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cave is strengthened with a Back-Bone, and eight Ribs, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely appendent, on each side. The Belly-piece is here wanting.</p>

                           <p>The HEAD of a SEA-TORTOISE. 'Tis large, and so shews the make of the Mouth the better: where the sharp and toothed edge of the nether Chap, strikes into a Canale cut into the Bone of the upper; and the toothed protuberance of the upper, into a Canale in the nether: by which means he easily sheers the Grass, or other Plants, whereon he feeds.

                           <p>An EGG of a SEA-TORTOISE. 'Tis very white, and <hi>Sphaerical,</hi> which I find no Author distinctly to say, but only to be like the Eggs of Fowls. About the bigness of an Hand-Ball. The shell rather thinner and softer than of a Hen's. She lays them in the sand, where they lie till they are hatch'd. Sometimes above a hundred at a breed.</p>
                           <p>The CHAMAELEON. By <hi>Wormius</hi> well described. <hi>Johnston</hi>'s Figure, especially as to the feet, very false. A most curious one in <hi>Calceolarius.</hi> As also in <hi>Besler,</hi> saving that his eyes are drawn somewhat too little. Of the skin it may be noted, that 'tis every where rough, as it were, with little round blisters or knobs; on his Head and Back, greater; on his Legs, Sides and Belly, lesser; of the bigness of Silk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worms Eggs. As also, that his hinder Feet are thicker than the fore-Feet: and the Heels or hinder Toes as long again, as the other; whereas in the fore-Feet, they are all of a length. The shape of his hinder Feet is therefore the better fitted to assist him in the climbing of Trees; the Heels be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing like strong Leavers to hoist him up. And the <hi>make</hi> of his Skin, for the changeableness of his Colours; which seems to depend on the falling or swelling of the said Knobs; whereby the light, receiving different Reflections, produceth different Colours. Of his Colours, saith <hi>Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liger,</hi> 
                              <note n="b" place="margin">Exercit. 196. Sect. 4.</note> from the Observation of <hi>Joh. Landius,</hi> it is not so properly said, that they are chang'd, but only the several <hi>Species</hi> highten'd or deepen'd. He hath a long Tail, as a <hi>Lizard,</hi> but slenderer: which, <note n="c" place="margin">Panaro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus.</note> as he descends from a Tree, he laps round about the Boughs, to keep himself from fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.

                           <p>Of the inward Parts, see the <hi>Philos. Trans. N.</hi> 49. But especially <hi>Dominicus Panarolus,</hi> who together with his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinal Observations, hath published the Description and Anatomy hereof. Amongst other particulars, the Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Membrane of the Eye, by which singly all those motions are perform'd, which in other Animals require six, and in some seven Muscules, is remarkable. As also the distinct continuation of the Optique Nerves from their Original to each Eye; whereby the uniform or conjunct motion of both his Eyes is not necessary, as in other
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:47321:27"/>
Creatures; but he is able to move one upward or back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and the other downward or forward, or any other way, at the same time. No less the fabrick of his Tongue; which being hollow from end to end, with a string run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning through the hollow, fasten'd behind to the <hi>Os hyoides,</hi> before to its extremity, it darts out and contracts it self in an instant: and with a Viscous substance at the end, catches the Prey, which are Flys and other Infects, as we use to do Birds with Limetwigs. Thus far <hi>Panarolus.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>In the <hi>High-hoe,</hi> and other Birds of this kind, there is a peculiar <hi>Cystis,</hi> wherein a Viscous matter, like that above mention'd, is stored, and a Pipe deriving it thence into the Mouth; the Description whereof I may hereafter publish. I suppose therefore, that upon further examination, the like Contrivance will be found in a <hi>Chamaeleon.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>It may be noted, That <hi>Panarolus,</hi> about the beginning of his Description, calls the <hi>Chamaeleon</hi> a slow Creature: Yet saith afterwards, (towards the end) that he climbs Trees so wonderfully swift, as if he flew. He is not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore so properly slow, as perhaps sullen and humerous.</p>

For the most part, those that are new and not worn, are toothed, like a small Saw, on their sides.</p>
                           <p>The <hi>Vertebrae,</hi> in all, sixty. Those of the Neck, are seven, as in a Man. The first whereof, in a Man called the <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las,</hi> hath a <hi>Processus</hi> in the figure of the <hi>Epiglottis.</hi> The other six, have each one <hi>Processus</hi> or <hi>Prominent</hi> Part, which is long, broad, sharp, and upright: and two that are trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse, and short; to which are joyned, by a <hi>Cartilage,</hi> so many <hi>Ossa mucronata,</hi> one shorter than another from the Head toward the Trunk. But the <hi>Vertebrae,</hi> one lesser than another, from the Trunk towards the Head.</p>
                           <p>The <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the Back, nineteen; that is, three sevens running one into another. Each of which hath three <hi>Prominent</hi> Parts, which are sharp, broad, and long; one perpendicular, and two that are transverse, or at right angles.</p>
                           <p>The Ribs 24, twelve on each side. Seven of which, have each of them double <hi>Cartilages,</hi> that is, one after another, appendent to them.</p>
                           <p>The fore part of the <hi>Sternum</hi> is plainly bony. The hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der part, cartilaginous; shaped like the <hi>Os Hyoides</hi> in a Man.</p>
                           <p>The <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the Tail, are 34; or (if you add the last of the Trunk as common to both) 35; that is seven times seven.

The first 14, are double, in number to those of the Neck, the next 19, are equal to those of the Back; the last answers to the Head.

                           <p>The Bones of the fore-Foot, 27. The Thigh-Bone near a foot long; an inch and ¼ over. The Leg-Bones, two; each a little above ½ a foot long; and of equal thickness, <hi>sc.</hi> about ¼ of an inch over. The Foot strictly so call'd, the length of the Thigh. The Bones of the <hi>Pedium,</hi> four. The Fingers or Toes, five. The inmost, the thickest, like a Thumb. From thence, the third, the longest. The Bones of the Thumb, three; of the next Finger, four; of the next, five; of the two outmost, four; in all 20. All armed with black Claws, a little crooked, and not much above an inch long.</p>
                           <p>The Hip-Bones are three; each of them ½ a foot long.</p>
                           <p>The Bones of the hinder Foot, 24. The Thigh-Bone above a foot long, and an inch and ½ over. The Leg Bones almost eight inches long. The inmost, above an inch over; the other, but ½ an inch. The Foot, so called, the length of the Thigh. The Bones of the <hi>Pedium,</hi> four. The Toes, four; whereof the inmost, the greatest; the third, the longest. The Bones of the great Toe, three; of the next, four; of the third and fourth, five. The Claws somewhat bigger than in the fore-Foot.</p>
                           <p>Amongst other things worthy of note, the senselesness of the tradition of the <hi>Crocodiles</hi> moving his upper Jaw, is plain from the structure of the Bones, that is, the Articu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation only of the <hi>Occiput</hi> with the Neck, and of the nether Jaw with the upper, as above said.</p>
                           <p>The first Author of it was <hi>Aristotle,</hi> in his Fourth Book <hi>de Partibus Animalium, Cap.</hi> 11. And thus much is true, not only of this Creature, but of all others, which have a long Head, and a wide <hi>Rictus,</hi> that when they open their Mouths, they seem to move both Jaws; as both the <hi>Viper,</hi> and the <hi>Lizard.</hi> And for the same reason, <hi>Columna</hi> 
                              <note n="a" place="margin">Lib. de Aquatil.</note> might say as much of the <hi>Hippopotamus,</hi> that he moves the upper Jaw, as the <hi>Crocodile.</hi> So all Birds, especially with long Bills, shew the contemporary motion of both the <hi>Mandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulae;</hi> the <hi>Musculi splenii</hi> pulling back the <hi>Occiput,</hi> and so a little raising the upper, while the <hi>Musculi Digastrici</hi> pull
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:47321:29"/>
the other down. But that this motion was not meant by <hi>Aristotle,</hi> appears in his First Book <hi>de Hist. Anim, c.</hi> 11. <hi>&amp; lib.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 7. where he saith more plainly, That of all other Animals, only the <hi>Crocodile</hi> moveth the upper Jaw. So that he speaks of it, as a motion strange and peculiar; as if the upper Mandible did make an <hi>Articulation</hi> with the <hi>Cranium:</hi> contrary to what is here seen. And if we will hear <hi>Piso,</hi> who probably speaks <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s meaning, as plainly as he doth his own, he goes further, and saith, <note n="a" place="margin">Hist. N. lib. 5.</note> That the <hi>Crocodile</hi> doth not only move his upper Jaw, but that his nether Jaw is immoveable. Than which As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion, to one that hath any competent knowledge in Anatomy, and seeth the Head and lower Jaw of this Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal articulated in the same way, as in other Animals, nothing can appear more ridiculous.</p>
                           <p>The WINDPIPE of a CROCODILE. It is almost an inch and ½ over. Composed of <hi>Cartilaginous</hi> Rings, not broken off, with a Membrane betwixt their ends, as in most <hi>Quadrupedes,</hi> but entire.</p>

The inmost Toe is joyned to the next, by a Membrane, for the length of an inch and ½. This to the third, by a like Membrane for the length of an inch. This again to the fourth, for the length of an inch and ½. The fourth, almost loose from the last. The Picture also, commonly given, falsly represents the fore-Leg equal to the hinder, which is far longer and thicker.</p>

It was brought from <hi>Africa.</hi> This <hi>Lizard,</hi> saith <hi>Wormius,</hi> moveth his upper Jaw, as the <hi>Crocodile.</hi> Which, in what sense it is false and absurd, I have above shew'd.</p>
                           <p>The SCALY-LIZARD. He is well pictur'd in <hi>Besler.</hi> As also in the <hi>Musaeum</hi> of <hi>Olearius. Aldrovandus</hi> gives only a rude half draught, and without any Description, as well as the former. <hi>Clusius</hi> only saith, He remembers that he had seen one of them. <hi>Bontius</hi> 
                              <note n="a" place="margin">Hist. N. l. 5. c. 8.</note> hath his Picture, but a very bad one. Else-where I find it not. He hath also described him, but very defectively, and with several mistakes.</p>
                           <p>He is a yard and ½ long. His Head from his Nose-end to his fore-Feet not above three inches. He hath no Neck. His Trunk, from the fore-Legs to the hinder, not above ten inches and ½. His Tail exceeding long, <hi>sc.</hi> a yard and half a quarter. His Head above two inches over. His Nose near an Inch. His Trunk almost four. His Tail mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately taper'd, and ending obtusely. The under part of the Tail is plain or flat; the upper part, hyperbolick. His fore-Legs, contrary to what they are in other <hi>Lizards,</hi> are longer than the hinder; these, not above three inches and ½; those, above four. The Claws also of the fore-Feet are longer; the longest about an inch; those of the hinder, but ½ an inch. He hath only four Toes and a Heel, both before and behind.</p>
                           <p>He is all over, except his Throat, Belly, the lower part
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:47321:30"/>
of his fore-Leg, and the inward part of his hinder, cover'd with Scales, very thick, and in hardness answering to the most solid Bone. The basis of each Scale (perhaps through age) of a blackish yellow, the Cone betwixt yellow and straw-colour, or like old <hi>Ivory.</hi> Adorned with <hi>Striae</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from the base to the Cone. Set together, with an alternate respect, as the Scales of Fishes. In the Trunk, there are 10 or 11 filed to each Rank. Towards the end of the Tail, but five. The greatest, near two inches broad; the least, a quarter of an inch. On his Forehead, Back, and fore part of his Tail, they are flat. But on the edges of the Tail, they are doubled into an acute Angle, the one half of each standing on the Convex, the other on the flat of the Tail.</p>
                           <p>He is said to be a most tame and innocent Creature.

A greater agility without feet, than we see in most Creatures that have four.

                        <p>The SLOUGH of an ENGLISH VIPER. That is, the <hi>Cuticula.</hi> They cast it off twice every year, <hi>sc.</hi> at Spring and Fall. The separation begins at the Head; and is finish'd in the space of 24 hours. From all parts so entire, that the very <hi>Tunica Adnata,</hi> or outward Skin of the Eye it self is here plainly to be seen.</p>
                        <p>A Gelly made hereof, is order'd to be used for the making up of the compounded Powder of Crabs Claws into Balls. Which way of preservation, were no less pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for divers other Cordial Powders; especially such as are <hi>Aromatick,</hi> and whose Virtue lies in parts that are of themselves volatile and easily evaporable.

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:47321:32"/>
somewhat after the manner, as in divers other <hi>Indian</hi> Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents. Towards the Head it is somewhat slenderer, than about the middle; where it is in compass, half a yard. 'Tis almost seven yards long. See the Description of the Serpent in <hi>Piso.</hi> He is of all other kinds the greatest. But not so venimous, as are many others. <hi>I have now at home,</hi> saith Bontius, <hi>the Skin of a Serpent</hi> (of this kind) <hi>twelve yards long, which I kill'd in a Wood in</hi> Java. And, that in that Kindgom, was one taken <hi>thirteen yards and ½ long, with a Boar in her Belly;</hi> of which, being boyl'd, the general <hi>D. Petrus,</hi> and others did eat a part. <note n="a" place="margin">Hist. Nat. l. 5. c. 3.</note> And <hi>Joh. de Laet.</hi> reports, <note n="b" place="margin">Lib. 14. c. 1.</note> That in <hi>Rio de la Plata,</hi> a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of the <hi>West-Indies,</hi> there are some <hi>quatuor Orgyas longi,</hi> and so big, as to swallow a Stagg whole, horns and all. Of such kind of Serpents, see also <hi>Marcus Paulus Venetus,</hi> and <hi>Athan. Kircher.</hi>

                        <p>This Serpent, says <hi>Piso,</hi> will thrust his Tail up a Mans Fundament, and gird him about the middle till he kills him. <note n="d" place="margin">Hist. N.</note> Yet is it probable, that they communicate no Venime by their Tail, but only are so cunning as to use that way, whereby to take the faster hold. Not only the Natives, but the <hi>Hollanders</hi> that live amongst them, make them part of their food. <note n="e" place="margin">Ibid.</note>

                        <p>The SKIN of the IBIBABOCA. Another Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of <hi>Brasile,</hi> so called by the people there. 'Tis a foot round about, and almost three yards and half long. His colours, originally, are white, black, and red. <note n="f" place="margin">Joh. de Laet. <hi>from</hi> J. Lerius.</note> Of all the kinds of Serpents, his Bite is the most pernicious, yet worketh the slowest. <note n="g" place="margin">Ibid.</note> 'Tis healed by a <hi>Cataplasme</hi> made of the Head of the Serpent. <note n="h" place="margin">Piso.</note>

                        <p>Two SKINS of the same kind, about eight feet long; and with their colours elegantly chequer'd, as in the former.</p>
                        <p>The SKIN of a RATTLE-SNAKE; a Serpent so called, from the Rattle at the end of his Tail. By the Natives of <hi>Brasile,</hi> BOICININGA. Well described by <hi>Franciscus Ximenez;</hi> and from him by <hi>Joh. de Laet.</hi> But his Rattle is no where well pictur'd. Neither doth <hi>Ximenez,</hi> or any other Author observe the true structure of it.</p>
                        <p>It is composed of about 8, 10, or 12, some times, as
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:47321:32"/>
this before us, of sixteen white Bones, but very hollow, thin, hard, and dry, and therefore brittle, almost like Glass, and very sonorous. They are also all very near of the same bulk; and of the self same Figure, almost like the <hi>Os Sacrum</hi> in a Man. For although the last of all only, seems to have a kind of a Ridged Tail or <hi>Epiphysis</hi> adjoyned to it, yet have every one of them the like; so, as the Tail of every uppermost Bone, runs within two of the Bones be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it. By which <hi>Artifice,</hi> they have not only a moveable coherence, but also make a more multiplied sound, each Bone hitting against two others at the same time.</p>
                        <p>By this Rattle, those that travel through the Fields, or along the High-ways, are warned to avoid coming near so noxious a Creature. For those that are bitten with him, sometimes die miserably in 24 hours; their whole body cleaving into chops. <note n="a" place="margin">Franc, Ximenez <hi>quoted by</hi> Joh. de Laet. l. 5. c. 15.</note> They commonly bury the Limb that is bitten, and so keep it, till the pain wears off. <note n="b" place="margin">Bontius.</note> By thrusting the end of his Tail, saith <hi>Piso,</hi> up into a Mans Fundament, he kills him immediately. But he seems here falsly to attribute that to this Serpent, which he doth much more probably to the BOIGUACU. For this is but a lesser sort, seldom exceeding a yard and ¼, and therefore cannot do it by girding a Man about. And for there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any Venime in the Rattle, it was, I believe, hardly ever imagin'd by any other man. Their progressive motion, saith <hi>Joh. Lerius,</hi> is so swift, that they seem to fly. Which makes the Rattle to be so much the more useful, in giving timely notice of their approach. Some of the largest are in <hi>Panuco,</hi> a Province of <hi>Mexico.</hi> 'Tis said, that the smell of <hi>Dittany</hi> kills him. <note n="c" place="margin">

                        </p>
                        <p>It is affirmed by <hi>Marggrarius</hi> and others, that as many years old as the Serpent is, the Rattle hath so many joynts. Which if it be true, then they will live at least sixteen years, some Rattles (as this here) consisting of sixteen joynts. Which makes the Tradition very suspicious.</p>
                        <p>About fourteen more SKINS of the RATTLE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SNAKE. Some of them are all over of a dark-brown. Others chequer'd with a brown, upon ash-colour.</p>
                        <p>Several RATTLES of the same Serpent; most of them composed of above ten joynts.</p>

Head. 'Tis as white as Starch, and tastless. Makes a noise between the Teeth, like that Mineral called <hi>Agaricus Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralis.</hi> Acid, and especially Nitrous Spirits dropped upon it, produceth a considerable effervescence.</p>
                        <p>The SERPENT-STONE. Said by some, to be factitious, By others, to be a Natural Animal Stone. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly by Sir <hi>Philiberto Vernatti,</hi> an observing Person, to be taken out of the Head of a Serpent in <hi>Java,</hi> from whence it was sent by him hither. It seems to be that called <hi>Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>golda,</hi> which <hi>Boetius,</hi> out of <hi>Ferdinando Lopez,</hi> saies is taken out of the Head of an Animal, which the <hi>Indians</hi> call <hi>Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goldalf.</hi> Whether it be natural or artificial, I shall here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe it.</p>
                        <p>'Tis about ¾ of an inch long, above ½ over, and ¼ thick; flat and almost orbicular, like a Cowslip-Cake, or other like Confection. All round about very smooth, and shining, for the greater part, black; but with some ash-colour inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed; so as to look like a River-pebble. But of a substance soft and friable, like the Oriental <hi>Bezoar.</hi> And in like manner, as the same Stone, is easily dissolved with any Nitrous Spirit dropped upon it, but not with other Acids. Which is to me an argument that it grows within some Animal: it being the nature of most Animal-Stones, to be dissoluble only by Nitrous Spirits.</p>

And the like I have heard affirmed of the same Stone by a Physitian of Note in this City.</p>

                           <p>A Great BAT or FLITTER-MOUSE of the WEST-INDIES. <hi>Vespertilio Americ.</hi> The Bat stands in the Rear of Beasts, and in the Front of Birds. I meet with no full Description of this kind. From his Nose-end to his <hi>Anus</hi> almost a foot. His Body almost three inches over. His Head two inches and ½ long, one and ½ over. His Nose like a Dogs, the end about ½ inch broad. His Ears extream thin, about ¾ of an inch long, and as broad; an inch and ½ asunder. His Eyes ⅓ of an inch long. He hath six and thirty Teeth. In each Chap before, are four little ones, roundish, blunt, and almost flat-ended; rather <hi>Tunsores,</hi> than <hi>Incisores.</hi> The next are large, shaped like the Tusks of a Dog, two in each Chap. Next to these, two more of the first kind in each Chap. And last of all twenty Grinders.</p>
                           <p>The Wings stretched out, are two or three inches above a yard wide from end to end. The upper part of the Arm that governs them, about four inches long, and fleshy, <hi>sc.</hi> an inch over. The next, or the <hi>Cubitus</hi> also four inches long, tendinous, and slender, not above ¼ of an inch thick. The Fingers are five, or four and a Thumb. Each hath three Bones. The first Bone of the fore-Finger or Thumb, is above ½ an inch long; the middlemost, an inch and ½; the last very short, sheathed within a sharp and crooked Claw, ¾ of an inch long, almost like that of a Hawk. The first Bone of the next Finger, is above three inches long; the middlemost, but ¾ of an inch; the last, about ½ an inch; having a very little Claw. The first Bone of the third or middle Finger, is four inches long; the middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:47321:34"/>
three; the last, three and ½. The first of the fourth, is also four inches long; the middlemost, two and ½; the last, as much. The first of the fifth or utmost Finger, is also four inches long; the middlemost, two; the last, as many.</p>
                           <p>His Thigh an inch and ½ long, and fleshy, yet not much above ½ inch over. His Leg two inches long, tendinous, and about ¼ of an inch thick. The <hi>Pedium,</hi> above ½ inch long. The Toes, five; each of them about an inch and ½ long; and each having a Claw, like that on his Thumb. The two inmost, have each two Bones; the other have three.</p>
                           <p>The Membrane which makes the Wings, excepting only his Head, Neck, two joynts of his Thumb and the bottom of his Feet, is spread from the top of his Back, over all his Parts.</p>
                           <p>He hath no Tail.</p>
                           <p>The shape and number of his Teeth, shew him to be a Voracious Creature. The Claws of his Thumb and Feet, that he is also Rapacious. The structure of his Wings is admirable. For were they to be always stretched out, they were (as to the length of the Bones) the most irregular and ill contrived of any thing that ever was seen. But being made to open and shut, shew the greater <hi>Artifice,</hi> in having the Bones of such a length, as might serve for all the Positions betwixt being quite open and quite close. The particular explication whereof, notwithstanding, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be made, without examining the several Muscules, by which all the said positions are determin'd.</p>
                           <p>Another WEST-INDIAN BAT of the same kind. There are many of them in <hi>Brasile.</hi> The <hi>Chine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> esteem of them as a delicate sort of meat. <note n="a" place="margin">Kirch. Chin. Illustr.</note>

The least kind, <hi>Clusius</hi> calls the King. Because (as he saith, from the report of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Mariners) as they fly together, about 30 or 40 in a flock, he always keeps higher than the rest.) Besides the smallness of his Body, in respect to what his copious Plumes shew him; the long Feathers which grow upon his sides under his Wings, and are extended thence a great way beyond his Tail; and the two long Strings or Quills which grow upon his Rump, do most remarkably distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish him from all other Birds. He is elegantly figur'd in <hi>Calceolarius</hi>'s <hi>Musaeum,</hi> with the Title of <hi>Chamaeleon aereus.</hi>

                           <p>The Teeth of the Bill, not being made to point inward, but forward or outward, plainly shews, that they serve not, as they do in some other Birds, to hold fast the Prey; but rather, for some purpose or other, to perform the use of a Saw.</p>

                           <p>THe HEAD of the JABIRU. The Bird is described by <hi>Marggravius, Piso,</hi> and <hi>Willoughby.</hi> He is bigger than a <hi>Swan.</hi> I will take leave to describe the Bill a little more fully.</p>
                           <p>'Tis above a foot and ¼ long; The Skull about three inches, and two broad. The Bill black, 13 inches long, an inch and 1/<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap> broad underneath. Both the Beaks are bended upwards and crooked all along. The upper, an inch and ½ high, consisting of one triangular Bone, having a sharp Ridge on the top, and is sharp-pointed. Its hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der edges are carved with oblique Furrows or Grooves. The Nostrils ½ an inch long, an inch and ½ before the eyes. The nether Beak an inch high, and concave, but one Bone, or if you please, two joyned together for the length of half a foot from the point.</p>
                           <p>The <hi>oblique Furrows</hi> in the Margins of the upper Beak, are a singular Contrivance of Nature, not only here, but in many other Birds, for the more safe reception of the nether Beak; <hi>vidt.</hi> least it should go awry either with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in or without the upper, as often as it is forceably pull'd to it, and so cause a dislocation, or a strain.</p>
                           <p>Another HEAD of the same kind and bigness.</p>
                           <p>The HEAD of an INDIAN HERON. I meet nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Animal nor with the Head any where de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed, or figur'd. The Skull is about three inches square.
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:47321:39"/>
The Bill above ¾ of a foot long. The upper Beak from edge to edge near two inches over. Consists of one Bone, Triangular or Ridged at the top, a little crooked down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, Concave, and sharp-pointed. Its hinder <hi>Margins</hi> are obliquely furrow'd, as in the <hi>Jabiru.</hi> The nether Beak underneath two inches and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>/2 over. Consisteth of two Bones, joyned together for the length of not above an inch and ½ from the point, which is not above a fourth part of the length of Conjunction in the <hi>Jabiru.</hi> The edges of both the Beaks run along in a strait line.</p>
                           <p>Of the use of the oblique Furows, before. According to the length of the said Conjuction of the bones of the nether Beak from the point, the Bird may be conjectur'd more or less voraceous. For by how much this is the shorter, by so much more may the Skin of the Beak be dilated for the comprehending of the greater Prey: as is more remarkable in the <hi>Pelecan.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The HEAD of an INDIAN STORK. I find not the Bird, nor the Head<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> any where describ'd, or figur'd. The Skull is four inches high, and almost square. The Skin of the Neck, as it is stuff'd up and stretched out with Wooll, is a foot about; standing out with a bunch in the usual place of the Crop. The Bill it self is above a foot long: and three inches and ¼ high. The upper Beak, from edge to edge, two inches over; is one triangular, and sharp-pointed Bone, ridged at the top, and a little crooked downward; but with strait <hi>Margins,</hi> and obliquely fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row'd behind, as in the <hi>Jabiru.</hi> The Nostrils ¾ of an inch long, and two inches before the Eyes. The ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Beak consisteth of two Bones joyned together for the length of three inches from the point; the edges whereof are a little crooked upwards. Underneath, above two inches over. The edges of both the Beaks are made rough, like a Saw, with numerous small and oblique Inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions directed backward, or looking towards the Throat.</p>
                           <p>The same oblique and small Incisions are visible in the Bills of divers other Birds of the Rapacious kind; in all made for the more secure retention of the Prey.</p>

                           <p>The BALEARICK CRANE.

See the Description and Picture of the Bird in <hi>Willughby</hi>'s <hi>Ornithologia.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>I once dissected this Bird, but found not the same kind of Windpipe (with curious <hi>flexures</hi>) as is described by <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thol.</hi> 
                              <note n="b" place="margin">Hist. Cent. 4.</note> and Mr. <hi>Willughby,</hi> and by them observed in the <hi>European Crane.</hi> They are therefore so far two different <hi>Species.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The HORN of the UNICORNE BIRD; In <hi>Brasile</hi> called ANHIMA. Described by <hi>Marggravius,</hi> and <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lughby,</hi> out of him. His principal marks are these; Headed and Footed like the <hi>Dunghill Cock,</hi> Tail'd like a <hi>Goose,</hi> Horned on his Forehead (with some likeness) as the <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corne</hi> is pictur'd; Spurd on his Wings; Bigger than a <hi>Swan.</hi> The Male, say <hi>Marggravius</hi> and <hi>Piso,</hi> as big again.</p>
                           <p>The HORN was given by Father <hi>Hieronymus Lobus.</hi> In the Bird which <hi>Marggravius</hi> describes, the Horn was but a little above two inches long. But this is above three, and about as thick as a Bodkin. The top also of this is not sharp, as figur'd (and I doubt feigned) by the same Author, but blunt; and, contrary to what is seen in Horns, rather thicker than toward the bottom. It is but of a softish and brittle substance, inferior to the softest sort of Horns. Considering which, and the bluntness of it, as well as smallness, compared with the Bird, it cannot be
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:47321:40"/>
thought to be defensive or offensive, as a true Horn, but must have some other use.</p>
                           <p>Being taken in any convenient Liquor, saith <hi>Piso,</hi> to the quantity of about <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>ij, it is often successful in Malignant Fevers, and against Poyson, by provoking sweat.</p>
                           <p>The SPUR of the UNICORNE BIRD. It grows as is above said, on the fore-Joynt of the Wings. Triangular, sharp-pointed, and an inch and ½ long. Said by <hi>Marggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius,</hi> mistakingly, to be strait; it being crooked (a little upwards) as a <hi>Cocks</hi> Spur; and thereby fit more effectually to wound.</p>
                           <p>The HEAD of the SHOVLER or SPOONBILL. The former Name the more proper, the end of the Bill being broad like a Shovel, but not Concave like a Spoon, but perfectly flat. The extremity of each Beak is a little hooked downward. And they are both made very rough within with numerous and crooked <hi>Striae.</hi> A device of Nature, for the better holding of the Prey.</p>
                           <p>This Bird is of affinity with the <hi>Heron</hi>-kind, from which he scarce differs in any Part, saving the Bill. He feeds on Shell-fish. Wherewith having fill'd his Crop, he lets them lie there, till the heat of it makes them open: whereupon disgorging them, he picks the meat out of the Shells. Related by <hi>Gesner</hi> out of <hi>Aristotle, Aelian,</hi> and <hi>Cicero.</hi>

But that which is most remarkable, is the alteration of his colours, being at first black, then ash-colour'd; next white, after that scarlet, and last of all crimson, which grows the richer die, the longer he lives. <note n="b" place="margin">Joh. de Laet lib. 15. c. 13. &amp; Wil.

The Colours not the same in all parts, as in that of <hi>Marggravius;</hi> the hinder part of the Back and Tail being here of a bright Bay or Chestnut, inclining to red: in his, only black and green mixed. Perhaps

depending on the difference of Ages as in the <hi>Guara.</hi> The Membrane wherewith he saith the Head is cover'd, in this, growing on the Bill, is extended only over the Forehead like an inverted Peak. He saith, that on all the four Toes there grows a Claw, ½ an inch long: whereas the Claw of the hinder Toe or Heel is at least an inch and ½ long. On the fore Joynt of each Wing, grows a Spur, as in the <hi>Anhima;</hi> but not above ⅓<hi rend="sup">d</hi> of an inch long, round, and exceeding sharp. Which is omitted also by <hi>Marggravius,</hi> but mention'd by <hi>Piso.</hi> She is remarkably distinguished from all other Birds, by the slenderness of her Legs and Toes.</p>

                           <p>The Figure of each Beak, is truly Hyperbolical. The upper is ridged behind; before, plain or flat, pointed like a Sword, and with the extremity bended a little down. Within, it hath an Angle or sharp Ridge which runs all along the middle. At the top of the Hyperbole, not above ¼ of an inch high. The lower Beak, in the same place, above an inch high; hollow, and the <hi>Margins</hi> strangely expanded inward for the breadth of above ¼ of an inch, and somewhat convexly. They are both fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with black Teeth (as I call them from their use)
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:47321:41"/>
of an unusual figure, <hi>sc.</hi> slender, numerous and parallel, as in Ivory-Combs; but also very short, scarce the eighth of an inch deep. An admirable invention of Nature, by the help of which, and of the sharp Ridge above mention'd, this Bird holds his slippery Prey the faster.</p>
                           <p>What <hi>Cardane</hi> affirmeth of the <hi>Phaenicopter,</hi> That he moves the upper Jaw or Beak, I have observed, saith <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mius,</hi> to be true. <hi>Menippus</hi> the Philosopher also, <note n="a" place="margin">Lib. de Homine.</note> cited by <hi>Rondeletius,</hi> saith the same. But <hi>Wormius</hi> adds, That the cause is not so manifest, as in the <hi>Crocodile:</hi> yet shews not, in what respect. Hereof see <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.</p>
                           <p>As for the <hi>Phaenicopter,</hi> it must needs be said, That the shape and bigness of the upper Beak (which here, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to what it is in all other Birds that I have seen, is thinner and far less than the nether) speaks it to be the more fit for motion, or to make the appulse, and the nether to receive it. But there can be no determination of these matters, without Inspection into the Muscules and the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulation of the Bones.</p>
                           <p>Another PHAENICOPTER. The Tongue of this Bird, as <hi>Apicius</hi> saith, was a delicious Morsel amongst the <hi>Romans.</hi>

I add, That the shortness of his Trunk or Body, in respect to the other Parts, is observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; not being a foot long: whereas from the end of his Bill to his Rump, he's near an Eln long: and to the end of his Toes, he's above a yard and half. I shall describe his Bill a little more particularly.</p>
                           <p>The upper Beak, from the bottom of his Forehead, is fourteen inches long; behind an inch over, and convex or ridged; before, an inch and half over, and almost flat. It is composed of three Bones; the end of the middlemost is hooked like a <hi>Hawks</hi> Bill; the edges of the two utmost are sharp, and bended downwards; all made rough with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in with five or six edged-lines running through the length of the Beak: thus well contriv'd for the holding the most slippery Prey. The end of the nether Beak, is almost like
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:47321:42"/>
the Poop of a Ship. 'Tis in length sixteen inches, being extended (I think further than in all other Birds) an inch beyond the Eye: whereas the usual Picture, makes it to end as much before, or on this side it. Partly by this unusual production; the swallow is the greater, as fit for so vora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceous a Bird. It consisteth of two Bones, united together only at the end. To which, and part of his Neck, is sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned a Membrane vastly expansible; as appears in the Bird here preserv'd, capable of above two gallons of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and which <hi>Franciscus Stellutus,</hi> quoted by Mr. <hi>Willughby</hi> out of <hi>Joh.

It may not be improperly called the Crop, which in other Birds lies under the Neck, but in this is extended to the very end of his Bill.</p>
                           <p>'Tis probable, that the use of this Bag is not only for the reception, but also the maceration of his Meat. And that having taken his opportunity to fill it, by contracting it, presses the meat down into his Ventricle and Guts, by degrees, as they are able to subdue it. Besides the luxury of the Tast, which perhaps he enjoys all the while it lies in his Throat. 'Tis also probable, that the meat being herein warm'd, and made a little tenderer, the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male doth disgorge part of it, wherewith to feed her Young. And might occasion the Fiction, of this Birds feeding her Young, with her own Blood.</p>

                           <p>The SOLUND GOOSE. <hi>Anser Bassanus.</hi> See the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription hereof in <hi>Gesner</hi> and <hi>Willughby.</hi> He is in bigness and Feather very like a tame <hi>Goose.</hi> But his Bill longer, and somewhat pointed, more like that of the <hi>Guilemot.</hi> His Wings also much longer, being two yards over. Near <hi>Colshill</hi> in <hi>Warwick-shire</hi> there was one found, <hi>Nov.</hi> 1669.

                           <p>The PENGUIN. So called from his extraordinary fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. For though he be no higher than a large <hi>Goose,</hi> yet he weighs sometimes, saith <hi>Clusius,</hi> sixteen pounds. His Wings are extream short and little, altogether unuse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for flight, but by the help whereof he swims very swiftly. See his Description at large in the same Author; as also in <hi>Wormius,</hi> and <hi>Willughby</hi> out of both. I shall give a more full Description of the Bill.</p>
                           <p>'Tis black; from the corners of his Mouth four inches and ½ long. But the Horns, or horny portions, whereof it chiefly consists, are shorter; in the upper Beak, a little more than three inches long; in the nether, two. Again, in the upper, it is obliquely prolonged from the Margins to the Forehead; contrariwise, in the nether, it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely shorten'd from the Margins to that part under the Tongue. The upper Beak is an inch high, between the corners of the Mouth as wide, but presently rises up into a sharp Ridge. Its Edges about the middle, a little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vex; about the end, concave and sharp. They are double Grooved, <hi>sc.</hi> before and behind. In the end, 'tis crooked. The nether Beak behind as much over, as the upper; towards the end, more compressed. Hollow like a Trough. Its edges sharp, and convex before; behind, they are groov'd. In the middle, it bunches out underneath. The upper Beak, is out with seven or eight oblique and crooked Notches; the nether, with as many strait ones.</p>
                           <p>The height of the upper Beak; the sharpness, and the extuberance of the lower; together with the grooved
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:47321:43"/>
Edges of both, do all give the Bill a sure hold, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful strength. The three Grooves, as so many Joynts, keep the Beaks from distortion, when in case of missing the Prey, they are swifty and forceably clapt together. The sharp Edges of the nether Beak, serve instead of Teeth. The Bunch underneath, answers in some measure, to the strength of an Arch. The hight of the upper Beak, to that of a Board, when set upon its Edge.</p>
                           <p>The <hi>Penguin</hi> breeds in <hi>Canada,</hi> in the Island called <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> in those of <hi>Fero,</hi> and of the <hi>Magellanick</hi>-Sea, and is therefore by <hi>Clusius</hi> called the <hi>Magellanick-Goose.</hi> They work themselves, as the <hi>Coney,</hi> deep Buries by the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side. <note n="a" place="margin">Wormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us.</note>

'Tis also shorter, and answerably higher, and therefore rather stronger. When they fight, they will hold by their Bills so hard, as sometimes to break one anothers necks, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they'l part. Whatever <note n="c" place="margin">Willugh.

So that either this is not the Head of a <hi>Dodo,</hi> or else we have no where a true figure of it. I shall describe it as follows.</p>
                           <p>The SKULL is four inches long; the Bill, seven; two and ½ high; one and ½ broad. The upper Beak is hollow. Is composed of six Bones. The uppermost whereof is four inches and ½ long, above ½ inch high, and convex. The middlemost on each side, also four inches long, and about 1/<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap> of an inch high or thick. The lowermost, above five inches long, and ¼ high. Their Edges are furrow'd with oblique and deep Grooves both before and behind. All these five Bones are resimated or bended upward, with some resemblance to a Saddle. The sixth, at the end of the Beak, is a wonderful strong Bone, crooked exactly like the Bill of a <hi>Parret,</hi> and hollow; by the bow, almost three inches, and near an inch over. Its Edges are very keen, and standing out with two sharp or pointed Angles. The Nostrils are ¼ of an inch long, and almost two inches
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:47321:44"/>
before the Eyes. The nether Beak is composed of three Bones. The two hinder, four inches long, near an inch high, and bended answerably to those of the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Beak. Their Edges are cut with deep Furrows. The third, at the end of the Beak, is hollow, above an inch long, near as high. Its Edges very sharp, and hard, and exceedingly convex or bended downward. Underneath, a round and sharp Pin grows out from it in a level towards the Skull, near an inch and ½ long. It was brought from the <hi>Indies.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The shape of this Bill shews it to belong to a Bird of Prey, and as is most likely, some great Sea-Fowl; which I will venture to call <hi>The Great Indian Gull.</hi> The strength of the end of the upper Beak is remarkable: as also are the sharp and hard Edges of the nether; and the Grooved Edges of both; the use whereof see in the Description of some other Birds, as of the <hi>Jabiru</hi> and the <hi>Penguin.</hi> The up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Beak seemeth to be composed of so many Bones, partly, that if a Fracture should happen to one, it might there ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate, and the rest be secur'd.</p>

                              <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> Of the EGGS and NESTS of BIRDS.</head>
                           <p>OF EGGS, there is here a considerable number: which therefore I thought fit to put altogether in this Chapter. Their Figures, as they stand together, appear the more various. For some are almost Sphaerical or Round as a Ball: others, as the most, are more oblong. Of these, some few are perfectly Oval, <hi>i. e.</hi> with both the ends defined with two equal <hi>Ellipses:</hi> but most are Conical, or with one end sharper than the other. Of these again, most have their smaller end but Blunt; some few, very sharp. Lastly, almost all both Blunt and Sharp are Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vexly Conical, <hi>i. e.</hi> they are all along Convex, not only <hi>per ambitum,</hi> but between both ends: whereas some few are Plano-Conical, whose Superfice is in part level be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween both ends.</p>
                           <p>Their Colours are also various; as White, Pale, Livid, Ash-colour, Blew, Brown, Green. Their Spots, and Speckles, are also Iron-colour'd, Red, Bay, Musk-colour, Black, &amp;c. the Causes of all which, both Figures and Colours, were no unfit subject of enquiry. But here I can do little more than shew, to what Eggs in particular any of them do belong.</p>
                           <p>The EGG of an OSTRICH. 'Tis very smooth, and white; all over prict as it were with extream small brown Specks. Almost of a Sphaerical Figure. About half a foot, by its <hi>Axis,</hi> from end to end. Round about, by the breadth, sixteen inches, <hi>i. e.</hi> near five inches and ½ strait over. Both the ends of an equal Convexity. Sometimes so big, saith Mr. <hi>Willughby,</hi> as to weigh fifteen pounds. The Shell is of answerable thickness, in regard to its bigness, to that of other Birds Eggs. They are sometimes set in Silver, and used as Cups.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="76" facs="tcp:47321:45"/>Another white EGG, almost Sphaerical. 'Tis scarce so long as a Hens Egg, yet is as thick, as that of a Goose.</p>
                           <p>A third white EGG, almost Sphaerical. 'Tis scarce big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than a little Nutmeg.</p>
                           <p>The EGG of a CASSOARY. The Shell underneath or within is white: without, it is all over rough-cast with a Testaceous Crust of a pale Green colour. It is of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act Oval Figure, or with both ends equally Convex. In length, by its <hi>Axis,</hi> five inches, round about the breadth, eleven; <hi>i. e.</hi> a little above three and ½ strait over.</p>
                           <p>Another EGG of a CASSOWARY, like the former.</p>
                           <p>Another EGG perfectly Oval, or with both ends equally Convex. Exceeding white, as big as a <hi>Pigeons</hi> Egg.</p>
                           <p>Another EGG perfectly Oval, but somewhat lesser, and of a light Ash-colour.</p>
                           <p>Another EGG exactly Oval, and also of a light Ash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colour, but no bigger than a Nutmeg.</p>
                           <p>The EGG, as I take it, of the lesser DIVER or LOON. In bigness equal to a Hens. Of a pale wan colour. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tusely Conical, so as to come very near to an exact Oval.</p>
                           <p>The EGG, I think, of the WIGEON. It is of the same Colour and Figure as the last described: but some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what lesser.</p>
                           <p>Another EGG like the two former, but a little lesser. Inscribed, <hi>Arts:</hi> perhaps of the <hi>Anas Arctica</hi> or <hi>Puffin.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The Egg, as it seems, of the AUK or RAZOR-BILL. Of a pale and livid colour, with Iron-colour'd Spots sprinkled all over it. Obtusely Conical. In bigness, between those of a <hi>Turkey</hi> and a <hi>Hen.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The EGG, perhaps, of the biggest Arctick <hi>Loon.</hi> It is of a dark Green colour, besprinkled all over with Spots of a sad Bay. Both in figure, and bigness, like that of a <hi>Goose.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The EGG of a CROW. Of a Blew colour, besprinkled all over very full with dark brown Spots. Obtusely Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical. As big as a <hi>Pigeons.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The EGG of a GOLDFINCH. Of a whitish Ash-colour, besprinkled with dark brown spots. Yet not every where, but only on the thicker end. It comes near to an exact Oval.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="77" facs="tcp:47321:45"/>The EGG, I suppose, of a HOOP. It is longer than a large <hi>Damascene Plum.</hi> Obtusely Conical. Of an Ash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colour, stained with spots of a sad or deep Bay, and of a dark Brown.</p>
                           <p>The EGG of the KITTY. In Colour, Figure, and Big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, not much unlike the last described: yet somewhat lesser, and almost exactly Oval.</p>
                           <p>The EGG of the CADEY. Perhaps the <hi>Jackdaw,</hi> by some also called the <hi>Caddo.</hi> It is of a pale Blew, besprinkled with dark Spots.</p>
                           <p>An ash-colour'd EGG, speckled with Spots of a sad Red. Obtusely Conical; and as big as that of a <hi>Pigeon.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The EGG of the SEA-MOIT. In colour, almost like the last described. In bigness like to that of the Hoop.</p>
                           <p>An EGG in shape and bigness, like a <hi>Damascene Plum.</hi> Dyed with a full Blew, and sprinkled here and there with a few spots of a sad Bay.</p>
                           <p>The EGG of a REDSTART. Of a whitish Ash-colour. Speckled on the thicker end only, with a few spots of a sad Bay. In figure and bigness almost like an ordinary <hi>Acorne.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>A pale wan coloured EGG, in bigness not much unlike the former.</p>
                           <p>The EGG of a WAGTAILE. Of the same bigness with the last, but more Conical. Of a white colour besprinkled with very small and numerous specks of a blackish tincture.</p>
                           <p>An EGG of the same colour with that of the <hi>Redstart,</hi> but more Conical.</p>
                           <p>The EGG of a THROSTLE. Of a pale Blew, and speckled with a few spots of a sad Bay. As big as a lesser <hi>Damascene Plum.</hi> But with one end sharp.</p>
                           <p>The EGG of a STONERUNNER. Of an Ash-colour, besprinkled with sad Bay spots. Conical, and sharp. Of the bigness of a little Walnut. Here are four of them.</p>
                           <p>The EGG of a ROOK. Painted all over with Green and dark Brown spots. Conical, and sharp. Somewhat less than a <hi>Crow's.</hi>

In shape like a <hi>Turkeys.</hi> The other which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded sticks fast to the side of the greater; whether it did so originally, as also whether both of them contained White and Yelk, is uncertain. It is of the same figure, about four inches long, bigger than the biggest <hi>Hens</hi> Egg. The Shell of the same hardness and thickness as that of the greater.</p>
                           <p>'Tis plain, that the lesser Egg was first perfectly form'd.
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:47321:46"/>
But not being big enough to provoke the <hi>Vterus</hi> to exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, new matter gather'd round about it for another Egg: and was the more easily supplied, because so little spent upon the former. And it may be noted, That Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is so intent upon finishing her Work, that she may be observ'd much oftener to over do, than under do: you shall find twenty Eggs with two Yelks, or hear of twenty Animals with two Heads, for one that hath none.</p>
                           <p>From the Egg with the Lump at the greater end, it seems also plain, That the Shells of Eggs, although as hard as any Animal Stones, yet are not bred, as those, out of stony Parts visibly praeexistent in liquor, and so cluster'd together: but out of a liquid substance, not much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like to that which is separated by the Reins of Birds.</p>
                           <p>Of the figure of the Egg, it is observable, That it usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally answers to that of the Body or Trunk of the Bird to which it belongs: as the Fruit is longer or broader, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable to a tall or spreading Tree. And as it is a Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script from the Original; so it self an Original for the next Copy. So those Birds that have a Rump and hinder Parts more Oval and spreading, as the <hi>Duck;</hi> or more Conical, as the <hi>Dunghill-Hen;</hi> breed, and are bred of Eggs alike shaped, <hi>viz.</hi> That so there may be sufficient, yet no superfluous Room, or Matter, for the <hi>Chick.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Of the Number of Eggs laid at one Breed, it is also worth the noting, That Land-Fowl, and of these especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, such as are Domestick, and whereof there is conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually great destruction made, for the most part lay a considerable number of Eggs for one sitting. Whereas some Sea-Fowls, (as Mr. <hi>Willughby</hi> observes of the <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guin,</hi> and some others) lay but one. Because building upon the Rocks, where they are seldomer destroy'd, were they greater Breeders, there would not be room enough for the reception of the hundredth part of them.</p>

Given by Sir <hi>Joseph Williamson</hi> now President of the <hi>Royal-Society.</hi> It is an entire one, eight feet long, or about two yards and three quarters. Very beautiful in length, straitness, whiteness, and its spiral Furrows bigger and less, making about seven Rounds from the bottom to the top, or point. At the <hi>Basis</hi> or bottom, about seven inches round. From thence, for about a foot, it swells a little, and then again grows slenderer, all the way, and so ends in a sharp point. 'Tis also conically hollow at the <hi>Basis,</hi> for near three quarters of a foot deep.</p>
                           <p>The same Horn (together with the Fish it self, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times above 30 Elns long,) is described by <hi>Wormius.</hi>

Nor is it fixed in the Mouth, where all Teeth stand, but in the Snout. The reason why he calls it so, is, because it is fastened in the Snout, as Teeth are in the Jaw.

The same is also transcribed by <hi>Terzagi</hi> out of <hi>Wormius,</hi> into <hi>Septalius's Musaeum.</hi>

                           <p>Of the Virtue hereof, <hi>Wormius</hi> mentions two Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.

The other, upon twelve Grains hereof given after a Drachm of <hi>Nux Vomica.</hi> Both the Dogs lived; whereas two other Dogs having the same Doses, without the Horn, died. Both experiments are attested by several Physitians of Note.</p>
                           <p>The credit of these Persons is not doubted. But the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:47321:49"/>
question is, Whether these Dogs might not have liv'd without the Horn. As some Dogs that have been bitten by an <hi>Adder,</hi> have been observ'd to get over their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulsions, and recov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                              </gap>. It is also said in one of the Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments, that the Dog which liv'd, vomited: and in the other, there is nothing said to the contrary. The question therefore is, Whether many other things, which will cause vomiting, may not do as well, as this so much celebrated Horn?</p>
                           <p>Whatever it may perform against Poison, it hath, saith <hi>Bartholine,</hi> been very successfully used by Physitians in Malignant Fevers. As in that, which at <hi>Coppenhagen</hi> in the years 1652, and 1653. was very brief: and which it carr'd off with very great Sweats. <note n="a" place="margin">Barthol. Hist.

                           <p>Heretofore, the chief Bishops in <hi>Denmark,</hi> used to make their <hi>Episcopal</hi> Staffs of these Horns. <note n="d" place="margin">Ibid.</note> The Natives of <hi>Groenland,</hi> and other Places where the <hi>Sea-Unicorne</hi> is taken, arm the sharp ends of the thickest and longest of these Horns with Iron Beards, and so use them for the wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and taking of <hi>Whales.</hi>

                           <p>The SAW-FISH. <hi>Pristis. Johnston</hi> hath given a good figure <note n="e" place="margin">Tab. 4. N. 1.</note> hereof, but without either Name or Description. And that of <hi>Wormius</hi> is defective, and in some particulars, out.</p>
                           <p>This here is a young One; from the end of the Saw to the end of the Tail, four feet. The Saw it self above a foot; near its <hi>Basis,</hi> two inches broad; at the fore-end,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:47321:49"/>
one. Armed, on each side, with seven and twenty Spikes, each ½ an inch long, bended a little backward, and with two sharp edges behind, as the Spur of the <hi>Unicorne</hi> Bird hath above.</p>
                           <p>His Head very flat, about three inches long; behind, almost four inches broad; before, two. His Eyes an inch long, as much behind the Snout, two inches distant. Above ½ an inch behind his Eyes he hath two Spouts, about ¼ of an inch wide, by both which (as some Fishes by a single one) he casts out the Water, which in taking the Prey, or otherwise, he receives into his mouth. Beneath, close by the Root of the Saw, are two oblique Nostrils, an inch distant, figur'd like the letter S. An inch behind these, his Mouth, two inches and ½ over. His Lips are rugged with extream small round knobs. He hath no Teeth.</p>
                           <p>The Apertures of his Gills are five; placed obliquely, not on his sides, but his Breast, about four inches behind his Mouth.</p>
                           <p>His Trunk or Body presently behind his Head, becomes fives inches broad, and about three high; from whence it is again extenuated all the way to the end of his Tail.</p>
                           <p>He hath seven triangular Finns. On the bottom of his sides, two Gill-Finns, not behind the Gills, as in most Fishes, but for a good part before them; near eight inches long, above three broad, and almost horizontal. Three inches behind these, two Belly-Finns, two inches broad, five long, and as much distant. Directly over these, on the Back a fifth, four inches long, above three high. On the Back also, but near the Tail, a sixth, four inches long, and as high. The Tail-Finn, as it were half a Finn, being ½ a foot high, but underneath level with the Tail.</p>
                           <p>Cover'd all over with a tough and dark-colour'd Skin, somewhat rough, as you draw your hand forward: from the Belly-Finns to the end of the Tail, as it were pinched together into a little Ridge on each side. There are many of them in the <hi>Indian</hi>-Sea.</p>
                           <p>The reason why he hath two Spouts, seemeth to be the flatness and breadth of his Head or Mouth; in which the Water lying more spread, could not so expeditely be carri'd off by a single one in the middle, as by one on each side.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="86" facs="tcp:47321:50"/>He is said to defend himself from the <hi>Whale</hi> with his Saw. Wherewith, by its structure, 'tis plain, that he fetches his stroak backward or side-ways, the Spikes being bended, pointed, and edged, and so made to prick and cut, that way.</p>
                           <p>The SAW or SPIKED SNOUT of the SAWFISH. 'Tis a very large one, four feet long, or above an El'n by three inches. Its <hi>Basis,</hi> excluding the Spikes, seven inches broad. On each side are seventeen Spikes, most of them two inches and ½ long, and figur'd as above described.</p>
                           <p>The length of the Fish before described, from end to end, if compar'd with the Saw is as four to one. Therefore the Fish, to which this Saw belong'd, was near five yards and half long. Again, the number of Spikes in the Saw of the Fish now describ'd, compared with those in this great Saw, is somewhat more than as three to two. Therefore had the said Fish liv'd to the Age of this to which the great Saw belonged, it would have been eight yards in length.</p>
                           <p>Five more such like SAWS, somewhat less.</p>
                           <p>The HEAD of the RAPIER-FISH; called <hi>Xiphias.</hi> By the <hi>Brasilians, Araguagua.</hi> He is pretty well described by <hi>Rondeletius.</hi> Grows sometimes to the length of five yards. The Sword, which grows level from the Snout of the Fish, is here about a yard long, at the <hi>Basis</hi> four inches over, two edged, and pointed exactly like a Rapier. He preys on Fishes, having first stab'd them with this Sword. <note n="a" place="margin">Charl. Onom. Zoic.</note> The <hi>Whale,</hi> saith <hi>Ligon,</hi> to shake off the Sword-Fish and <hi>Theshall,</hi> his two mortal enemies, leaps sometimes more than his own length above water. <note n="b" place="margin">

                           </p>
                           <p>The HEAD of the TUCK-FISH. Of the Sword-fish kind, but a different <hi>Species</hi> from the former. Whether it be any where describ'd, seems doubtful. The hinder parts of the Head are here broken off. The Snout is not so flat as in the Rapier-fish, but thicker and rounder, more like a <hi>Tuck,</hi> from whence I take leave to name it. 'Tis half a yard long; near the Head, two inches over; about the middle, one. Not with a flat point, but one perfectly round. The upper part hereof is smooth, the nether
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:47321:50"/>
rough, the smooth and rough parts continu'd obliquely from the Point to the Root. Both the Chaps are also rough in the same manner, in the place of the Teeth, which this Fish hath not. The nether Chap hath also a different shape from that of the Rapier-Fish: this being not above four inches over, that half a foot; yet both are a foot long. It is composed of two Bones, so joyned together, for the space only of an inch and half, as to make a sharp point.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Marggravius</hi> and <hi>Piso</hi> (and out of these <hi>Johnston</hi>) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe an <hi>American</hi>-Fish by the name of GUEBUCU, of kin to this, the Head whereof is here describ'd. But cannot be the same, unless both the Pictures which they give, and <hi>Marggravius's</hi> Description (who particularly saith, That the Snout is sixteen inches long, the nether Chap, ten) be false. For in this Head, the nether Chap is broader, and comparatively not near so long.</p>
                           <p>The HEAD of the UNDER-SWORD-FISH. It is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed by no Author that I have perus'd. The Fish seems to be a smaller kind. The Head is of a triangular figure, having one acute Angle below, and a blunt one on each side. An inch and quarter high; the Forehead an inch over, flat, and scaly. In length 'tis about two inches and a quarter. The Eyes, proportionably, exceeding great, <hi>sc.</hi> three quarters of an inch over. The Snout half an inch broad, not above ¼ of an inch long, a little ridged in the middle. The Chaps, instead of Teeth, are rough with many little Asperities, almost as the skin of a <hi>Scate.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The Sword grows in a level, not from the upper but the under Jaw, from whence we may give the Fish his Name. In length three inches; near the Jaw half an inch over, from whence growing narrow all the way, it endeth in a Point like that of a Sword. It is not round, but flat, as that of the Rapier-Fish, and in like manner two-edged. It seemeth to be composed of two Bones, but very firmly coherent edge to edge all the way. Whether this Fish be Viviperous, is uncertain; yet being of the Sworded-kind, I have ventur'd here to describe the Head.</p>
                           <p>A pair of the MANATEE-STONE'S. Taken out of the Head of the SEA-COW, by the <hi>Indians</hi> called <hi>Manati.</hi> Bigger than the biggest sort of Walnuts; with several
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:47321:51"/>
knobs and hollows, like as in the Ear-Bone, but much greater. It is said by <hi>Joh. de Laet</hi> to be much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended against the Stone. There are two of them in every Head.</p>
                           <p>The Head of the <hi>Manati</hi> is like that of an Ox or Cow, from whence the <hi>English</hi> Name; his Eyes little; his Body long, like that of an <hi>Otter;</hi> his two Feet like an <hi>Elephants.</hi> Sometimes he is about thirty five feet or twelve yards long, and four broad. <note n="a" place="margin">Charl.

                           <p>The BALANCE-FISH. <hi>Zygaena Libella.</hi> Curiously pictur'd in <hi>Salvian.</hi> Where also see the Description. He hath his Name not unaptly from the shape of his Head, very different from that of all other Fishes, being spread out horizontally, like the Beam of a Balance; his eyes standing at the two extremes, as the iron Hooks do at the end of the Beam. He grows sometimes to the length of four or five yards: but this is a young one. They breed in the <hi>Mediterranian,</hi> especially, saith <hi>Bellonius,</hi> near <hi>Smyrna.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The HEAD of a great BALANCE-FISH. It is two feet ½ over, or from eye to eye. The Head of the lesser now mention'd, is five inches over, the Fish, 20 inches long. That therefore to which this great Head belong'd, was ten foot long.</p>
                           <p>The SKULL of the MORSE: so called by the <hi>Musco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites;</hi> by the <hi>Danes, Rosmarus.</hi> He hath four feet, and his Body shapen not much unlike the SEA-CALF. But grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth sometimes to be bigger than an Ox. In his upper Jaw, he hath two remarquakble TUSKS, bended a little inward. In this Skull, the exerted part is five inches long, and four round about at the Root. His other Teeth are undescrib'd. They are sixteen, eight on each Jaw. Not Grinders but Punchers, or somewhat answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:47321:51"/>
in shape to the Tusks of a Dog. In the upper Jaw, the longest; standing on each side, two or three of them, within side of the Tusks. They have a small flat on their insides, against which the Teeth of the under Jaw work; which are much smaller, and flat-sided. The shape of these Teeth seems no way fitted, and their strength very superfluous, for the eating of green Leaves at the bottom of the Sea, as this Animal is supposed to do.</p>
                           <p>The Figure which <hi>Olaus Magnus</hi> gives of this Animal, is fictitious. But that in <hi>Joh. de Laet</hi> (as to the Head at least) is a very good one: from whom <hi>Wormius</hi> borrows his. One of the Cubs is accurately described by <hi>Everh. Vorstius,</hi> quoted by <hi>John de Laet,</hi> by <hi>Wormius,</hi> and by <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zagi</hi> in <hi>Septalius's Musaeum.</hi> This Animal, when he goes, drags his hinder part after him, as the Seal.

They climb upon the Rocks on the Sea-side by the help of their great Tusks, wherewith, as with two Hooks, they hold themselves from sliping. They breed numerously near St. <hi>Lawrence</hi> Isle.</p>
                           <p>Their Tusks are used by the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Tartars</hi> for the making of Sword-Handles. <note n="b" place="margin">Musae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um Wormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anum.</note> I have a Girdle, saith <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mius,</hi>

                           <p>A PISLE, said to be that of the MORSE. 'Tis above a foot long, and seems to be only the exerted Part. At the Glans, half a foot about, now it is dry. The <hi>Muscovites,</hi> saith <hi>Vorstius,</hi>

weight. The sharpness and multitude of his Teeth espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, and the widness of his Mouth, are remarkable. They will often bite off the Legs or Arms of those that ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture into the Sea in a Calm; and sometimes swallow them up whole. <note n="a" place="margin">Ligon's <hi>Hist. of</hi> Barb. p. 5.</note>

                           <p>Their Teeth generally stand in a six-fold Row; but <hi>Bellonius</hi> observes one with four Rows only. There are some other Fishes which have as many, and the Scate hath more: but take their Number and Bigness together, and they are more considerable. In <hi>Septalius's Musaeum,</hi> there is one, saith <hi>Terzagi,</hi> (in words at length) with a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand and two hundred Teeth. But neither hath this here, nor had any other that I ever read of, near half so many.</p>
                           <p>Of his Optique Nerves, <hi>Rondeletius</hi> observes, That they are not, as in other Animals, but plainly <hi>Cartila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginous.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The <hi>Goldsmiths</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> saith the same Author, set the Teeth of the <hi>Shark</hi> (which there they call <hi>Serpents</hi> Teeth) in silver-Cases; and the Women hang them about their Childrens Necks, to make them breed their Teeth the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.

                           <p>The LONG-SNOUTED SHARK. So I call it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is much longer, than in the above-mentioned; so as to be as it were the beginning of a Horn. The Body of this likewise, in proportion, is much shorter and thicker. <hi>Rondeletius</hi> seems to give the Figure of this particular <hi>Species.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>There is no sort of Animal, saith <hi>Aristotle,</hi>

                           <p>The JAWS of a SHARK. There are six or seven pair of these here preserved. <hi>Terzagi</hi> mentions one pair

                           <p>Two great TEETH of a SHARK. They are both curiously indented, like a Saw, on each edge: as also the Teeth are in younger <hi>Sharks,</hi> but not so visibly. One of these is above an inch and half long. But one of those in a <hi>Shark</hi> of above two yards in length, is not half an inch. The <hi>Shark</hi> therefore, to which This belonged, was about eight yards long.</p>
                           <p>What the Teeth of a <hi>Shark</hi> wants in thickness, they have in breadth, whereby they are the more terrible; both pricking with their Points, and cutting with their Edges at the same stroak.</p>

                           <p>The TOOTH of a PICKED-DOG. Not much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like that of a <hi>Shark.</hi> The difference is, That the exerted part of this is bended, not inwards, but side-ways.</p>
                           <p>The SPOTED HOUNDFISH or SEA-PANTHER; <hi>Galeus Asterias;</hi> because of the Stars or Spots upon his Skin. But the radiation of the Spots in the Figure commonly given, is fictitious. See <hi>Rondeletius's</hi> Description. He hath a rough Skin, as have all of this kind. Yet this Author saith, he hath a smoother Skin, than the <hi>Galeus laevis:</hi> which, however comparatively taken, it may be true, is not well expressed of either. The said Roughness is caused by an infinite number of most hard and sharp Prickles, composed in the same manner as the Scales of Fishes.</p>
                           <p>The Female brings forth often times twice in one month, and so is said to <hi>Superfoetate:</hi> which, saith <hi>Aristotle,</hi> 
                              <note n="a" place="margin">Hist. An. lib. 6. c. 11. &amp; l. 5. c. 10.</note> seems rather to be, because her Eggs are hatched (in her Womb) one after another.</p>
                           <p>The PICKED-DOG. <hi>Galeus Acanthias.</hi> Because he hath two strong and sharp Spikes growing on his Back, behind the two Finns, and pointing towards his Tail. See the Description in <hi>Salvianus</hi> and <hi>Rondeletius.</hi> Besides the two Finns which grow on each side the <hi>Anus,</hi> the Males, saith <hi>Salvian,</hi> 
                              <note n="b" place="margin">Hist. 42.</note> have also two Appendices, one on each side the <hi>Anus.</hi> But betwixt the <hi>Anus</hi> and the Tail there is no under-Finn; by which he differs from the rest of the Dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. He is said scarce to grow so big, as to exceed twenty pounds in weight. His Skin is rough with the like Prickles,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:47321:53"/>
as in the former; so small, as scarcely visible without a <hi>Microscope.</hi> But easily felt by drawing your hand towards the head. The shape also of the Teeth is odd and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usual, being armed with little sharp Hooks on each edge. They are taken sometimes upon our <hi>English</hi> Coast.</p>
                           <p>The Anatomy of the <hi>Galeus</hi> (the Male) is given us by Sir <hi>George Ent,</hi> in Dr. <hi>Charleton's Onomastic. Zoic.</hi> Some of the most observable Remarks, are the peculiar shape of the <hi>Pancreas,</hi> and especially the Spleen, having a Label produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced from one side, above twice its own length. Likewise the Purse at the farther end of the <hi>Duodenum,</hi> into which it opens only by a very small round Hole, not so wide as to receive the end of ones little finger: all which are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed and figur'd. He hath also growing on the lower Eye-lid, a thick and firm Membrane, wherewith he often winkles or covers his whole Eye: the same with that called the <hi>Periophthalmium,</hi> common to very many Birds.</p>
                           <p>The Description of the Viviparous Eggs in the Female; which are not unlike to those of the <hi>Raya,</hi> is given by <hi>Ron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deletius. Bellonius</hi> hath seen an indifferent One, to bring forth thirteen young ones at a Birth. So soon as ever she hath brought them forth, they swim along with her, and if any of them are afraid of any thing, it runs imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately into the Mouth, say some, into the Womb of the Dam: when the fear is over, returns again, as if by a second Birth.</p>
                           <p>The Skin is used for the polishing of Wooden and Ivory Works.</p>
                           <p>The HEAD of a DOLPHIN, about a foot and ½ long. The <hi>Dolphin</hi> therefore to which it belong'd, was above two yards and half long. In the Skin, 'tis hard to find any passage of sound for Hearing. And <hi>Aristotle</hi> denies that the <hi>Dolphin</hi> hears.

                           <p>The TAIL of the DOLPHIN. It is expanded (as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so in the <hi>Porpess</hi>) in a way peculiar, not uprightly, as in other Fishes, but horizontally: by the help of which, he makes his Gamboles above the Water. And at the same

time takes his Breath: as Mr. <hi>Ray</hi> hath well observed of the same use in the <hi>Porpess.</hi> It is also of use to cast him forward by strong and repeated jirks, whereby he is so ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably swift, as it's said, above all other Fishes. <note n="a" place="margin">Phil.

                           <p>The SKELETON of a PORPESS, or Sea-Hog. <note n="b" place="margin">Tursio Plinii. Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caena Ron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deletii.</note> The Description and Anatomy of the Animal is given us by <hi>Bartholine</hi> (<hi>Hist. Cent.</hi> 2.) By Mr. <hi>Ray</hi> (<hi>Phil. Trans. N.</hi> 76.) By <hi>Dan. Major</hi> (<hi>Miscel. Curios. German. An.</hi> 4.) And lately more largely by Dr. <hi>Edward Tyson.</hi> Some of the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars more remarkable are, That the Fat, which is an inch thick, encompasseth the whole Body, as in a Hog. That the <hi>Fibers</hi> which run through the Fat from the <hi>Membrana Carnosa</hi> to the Skin, do obliquely decussate one another like a Lattice. And I may here observe, That the like Decussation is made betwixt the white and red <hi>Fibers</hi> of all <hi>Muscules.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>'Tis further noted, That the Fat is nothing else but Oil contained in a great number of little Bladders. I add, That all these Bladders are the continuation of the <hi>Fibers</hi> which decussate, in a finer Work. And that there is no difference betwixt the said <hi>Fibers</hi> and those of the <hi>Membra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Carnosa,</hi> saving their Relaxation, (as when a Spung swells with water) by the interposition of Oil.</p>
                           <p>The Stomach remarkable, consisting of three Bags. The Guts eleven times the length of the Fish. The Glands of the Kidneys so distinct, that each having a white substance in its centre, and out of that its <hi>Papilla,</hi> seemed to be another little Kidney, about the bigness of a large Peas. And I shall here take notice, That the whitish substance within every Gland, and the same which is in the Kidneys of other Animals, is truly Carneous or <hi>Muscular,</hi> by which the conveyance of the Urinous parts of the Blood into the <hi>Pelvis</hi> is promoted.</p>
                           <p>The Paps are placed one on each side the <hi>Pudendum.</hi> The <hi>Ovaria</hi> (it being a young Fish) not above an inch long, and thick as a Goose-Quill. The Diaphragme, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the usual Tendon in the centre. The Heart, with two Ventricles and two Auricles. The Foramen Ovale, closed. The Lungs consisting of two great Lobes. The <hi>Larnyx</hi>
                              <pb n="94" facs="tcp:47321:54"/>
very prominent, oddly shaped, like an old fashion'd Ewer. The Spout with strong Muscules; and <hi>Papillae</hi> for the issu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Snot. The Eye with the <hi>Musculus Suspensorius,</hi> as in Bruits. The Brain large, weighed above lbj <hi>averdupois,</hi> the Fish lbxcvj. The <hi>Musculus Psoas,</hi> and two others on the Back, very large and strong.</p>
                           <p>The Teeth (96 in all) so placed, that those of one Jaw, are received into the distances of the other. Stand not in distinct Sockets, but all in one common Furrow. The Ear-Bone is oddly seated in a hollow, and encompassed with Muscules. The <hi>Drum</hi> well braced, but no <hi>Incus stapes &amp; Malleolus</hi> to be seen. The Brain-Pan five inches broad, and but three long; the Brain answerable. The Back-Bone is composed of sixty <hi>Vertebrae. The same number, as is before observed to be in that of a Crocodile.</hi> The Bones of the Fore-Finns, resemble those of an Arm with Hand and Fingers. Of the Tail, like those of two feet joyned together.</p>
                           <p>From the Nose to the Tail-end about an Ell long, and roundish, the Eyes and the Gape of the Mouth small, the Back and upper parts black, the Belly white, the Tail hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zontal: much like a <hi>Dolphin,</hi> saving that she is shorter snouted.</p>
                           <p>The SEA-CALF or SEAL. <hi>Phoca. Vitulus Marinus;</hi> From the noise he makes like a Calf. See <hi>Rondeletius</hi>'s Description. His Head comparatively not big; shaped rather like an <hi>Otters;</hi> with Teeth like a <hi>Dogs;</hi> and Musta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches like those of a <hi>Cat.</hi> His Body long, and all over hairy. His fore-Feet, with Fingers clawd, but not divided; yet fit for going. His hinder Feet, more properly Finns, and fitter for swimming, as being an Amphibious Animal. The Female gives suck, as the <hi>Porpess</hi> and other Vivipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Fishes. This here is about a yard long. But some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they are as big, saith Mr. <hi>Ray,</hi> as a Heifer of two years.</p>
                           <p>The Skin of this Fish is commonly used for the cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Trunks. They are innumerable in the <hi>Atlantick</hi>-Sea; especially the Bay there called <hi>The Seal-Bay.</hi>

                              <pb n="95" facs="tcp:47321:54"/>The LONG-NECK'D SEAL. I find him no where distinctly mention'd. He is much slenderer than either of the former. But that wherein he principally differs, is the length of his Neck. For from his Nose-end to his fore-Feet, and from thence to his Tail, are the same measure. As also in that instead of fore-Feet, he hath rather Finns; not having any Claws thereon, as have the other kinds.</p>

                              <abbr>Esq</abbr>. The Teeth are shaped somewhat like a <hi>Dogs.</hi> The tops of them all are flat, being doubtless filed off. The <hi>processus</hi> of the <hi>Os Frontis</hi> which makes up the Orbit of the Eye in Land-Animals, is here wanting; and the said Bone pinched up much more narrowly: Both to make room, as it should seem, for a very large Eye. The passage into the Ears stands very oddly. In <hi>Dogs, Cats,</hi> and most other Land-Animals, forward and outwardly. But here it stands just oppositely, <hi>sc.</hi> behind and inwardly.</p>

                              <note n="a" place="margin">Tab. 27. f. 2.</note> who calls it a <hi>Sea-Wolf</hi> (<hi>Ein See-Wolf</hi>). As also by <hi>Johnston;</hi> but not described. But in <hi>Gesner</hi>'s <hi>Paralypomena</hi> 'tis both figur'd and described by <hi>Ge. Fabritius</hi> under the Name of <hi>Klipfisch</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> Rock-Fish,) so called by the people near the <hi>Baltick</hi> (where he breeds.) <hi>Fabritius</hi> is particular only as to the Teeth, and is also mistaken in some things. I shall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore add the Description I drew up before I met with his.</p>
                           <p>'Tis a yard long. The Head ½ a foot long, and almost as high; being compressed on the sides, three inches and ½ over underneath, her Forehead but a little above two. Her Snout a little Convex. The Eyes very high, an inch long. The Nostrils before the Eyes ¼ of an inch. Both the Chaps blunt-angled before, from the Corners of the Mouth three inches long, between the Corners, as much.</p>
                           <p>The Teeth all very thick, like those of <hi>Quadrupedes;</hi> both in figure and scituation, very unusual. In the upper Jaw, five before; not Incisors, or Cutters, but thick Pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers. To the Roots of which, within side, grow as it were nine little Teeth. Behind, are three Grinders; one
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:47321:55"/>
of which, on each side, is fasten'd obliquely inwards, half an inch broad, and above an inch long. The third, and the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, stands betwixt them in the middle of the Palate. Each of these having deep Incisions, seem, as it were, eight or ten Teeth. In the under Jaw, are two Punchers or Claviculars, each of them having two sharp Processes within side. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, there seems to be only one Grinder on each side, half an inch broad, and above two inches long, arched inward, and with sixteen or eighteen Incisions looking like so many Teeth.</p>
                           <p>Her Gills open almost from the top of her Head to her Throat. The Fins are four. The Gill-Fins about five inches long, and as broad, placed so low, as to meet in the Breast, and so to supply the Breast-Fins. The Back-Fin is extended from Head to Tail; before, an inch high; behind, above two. The Belly-Fin reaches from the <hi>Anus</hi> (which opens a foot behind the Head) to the Tail, about an inch deep. The Body, where highest, above ½ a foot, the Back a little convex, grows slender all the way to the Tail, the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity whereof is here wanting. She is cover'd with a tough Skin, now of an Iron-colour, besprinkled all over with round spots.</p>
                           <p>That which is most remarkable in this Fish, are his Teeth: which are so made, as to be fit either for Ravine, or for the eating of Grass and other Herbs on the Rocks, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Water. They seem also to be made for the Cracking of Shell-Fish. As likewise for Rumination: which may as well be ascrib'd to this Fish, as to the <hi>Scarus.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>This Fish is one, amongst divers other instances of <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi>'s error, where he saith, <gap reason="foreign">

                           <p>The SCATE, or Angel-Fish. <hi>Squatina, sive Angelus Marinus.</hi> The figure in <hi>Johnston</hi> is tollerable. But the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription very short and imperfect. That of <hi>Rondeletius</hi> is better, yet not full. And either the Fish he describes is a different Species, or his Description of the Teeth is not true.</p>
                           <p>This is above an Ell long. His Head about ¼ of a yard
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:47321:55"/>
long, and near as much over, (here) with several Angles or Ridges: His Mouth five inches over, his Lips almost Semilunar.</p>
                           <p>Each of his Jaws are armed with about six and thirty Rows of most sharp Teeth, and in every Row there are four Teeth. So that in all they are about two hundred four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score and eight, all couched a little inward.</p>
                           <p>About three inches behind his Nose-end stand his Eyes, as it were on the top of his Head, and three inches and ½ distant. Proportionably very small, <hi>sc.</hi> not above ½ an inch over. About an inch and quarter behind his Eyes, and a little lower, he hath two Spouts, one on each side, above an inch long, and convex before. His Neck ½ a foot over. His Back before, three inches above a foot, expanded (here) on both sides, as if it were shoulder'd. His Middle or Wast about eight inches. The lower part of his Back, ten inches, spread like a pair of Buttocks. From his Shoulders to the bottom of his Buttocks about a foot and ½. The length of his Tail, as much: the forepart whereof above four inches over, growing slenderer all the way to the end.</p>
                           <p>He hath seven Fins. His Shoulder-Fins with Cartilagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Rays, expanded ½ a foot out like a pair of Wings, and almost square. His Buttock-Fins prolonged hinderly ½ a foot, stand continguous to the Tail on both sides. On the top of his Tail, two lesser; three inches high, and couched backward. At the end a forked one ½ a foot long, and almost as high. From hence half a foot forward, the Skin is as it were pinched up into a little Ridge or Doublet on each side.</p>
                           <p>Above he is very rough with innumerable small Prickles, especially felt upon drawing your hand forward. And the edges of the four side-Fins are all thorny. But underneath the Skin is so thick or closely cover'd with little hard round knobs, as it seems almost smooth.</p>
                           <p>This Fish hath two Spouts, like the Saw-Fish, because of the breadth of his Head. His Teeth admirable for taking sure hold of the most slippery Prey. Those Doublets on the sides of his Tail, seem to add strength to the <hi>Muscules</hi> which move the Tail-Fins. And so in some other Fishes. By the posture of the Fins he seems to make at the Prey, not by a forward stroke, but by ascending as a Dog to his
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:47321:56"/>
Meat, or descending as a Hawk when she stoops. With the broad Fore-Fins, saith <hi>Oppian,</hi> the Female shelters her Young, as a Hen her Chickens with her Wings. But <hi>Aristotle</hi> affirms, That she gives them protection as doth the Dogfish, by receiving them into her mouth. He also saith, That of the Cartilaginous kind the <hi>Scate</hi> only beareth twice in a year, <hi>sc.</hi> Spring and Fall.</p>

The Skin of this Fish is used for the polishing of Wooden and Ivory Works. He is taken, saith Mr. <hi>Ray,</hi> sometimes near <hi>Cornwall.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Another SCATE. 'Tis a young one, but in shape altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like the former, saving that the Shoulder-Fins are here produced, more like a Wing, into a sharp Angle before.</p>
                           <p>The HEAD of a SCATE, about the bigness of that above described. Sometimes they grow to the weight of a hundred and sixty pounds.</p>

And with the same Hooks, both the Jaws: but far bigger, and standing in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Rows, eight, ten, or twelve in a Row.</p>
                           <p>The Skin of the <hi>Raja,</hi> being artificially reduced to a monstrous shape, is by some shewed, and is commonly taken, for a <hi>Basilisk.</hi>

                           <p>The EGG of a THORNBACK. <hi>Ovum Rajae Clavatae.</hi> Or rather the Bag or Case of the Egg. Hereof see <hi>Ron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deletius.</hi> 'Tis very smooth, and (now) black and horny. Seven inches long, and four over. From each of the four Corners is stretched a sharpe ended Membrane two inches long. In the middle it swelleth up on both sides: so that in shape 'tis just like a Pulpit-Cushion. There are some other lesser ones of the same shape and colour.</p>
                           <p>In the upper part of the Womb, saith <hi>Rondeletius,</hi> are a great number of Eggs of several sizes, consisting only
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:47321:56"/>
of a Yelk, as in the <hi>Ovary</hi> of a Hen. These successively ripening, are found in the lower part, consisting of Yelk and White, and cover'd with the said horny Case. Out of every one of these mature Eggs, another <hi>Foetus</hi> is also suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessively generated. Whereby it is intelligible, How this Fish produceth but one at once, and yet so numerous a breed.</p>

It is somewhat phantastically stuffed; yet I shall give the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription as well as it will admit.</p>
                           <p>From the tip of his Snout, to his Tail, a foot and three inches, about a foot over, and ½ a foot (being, I suppose, thrust out somewhat more than the natural dimension by the stuffing) in height. His Eyes ½ an inch long, two and ½ inches distant, three and ½ behind his Nose-end. Just be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind his Eyes, and a little more distant, he hath two Spouts, one way, an inch and ¼ over. His Snout prolonged for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward an inch and ½ with an Obtuse Angle; and extended towards the side-Fins, wherewith it is also joyned by the mediation of a Skiny-Border ½ an inch broad. His Mouth very little, not an inch and ½ over; curiously rough-cast like a file, underneath, and behind his Snout-end two inches and ½. Over his upper Chap hang two little Labels above ½ inch long.</p>
                           <p>His Gills are five on each side, but towards the middle of his Belly. He hath four side-Fins. His fore-Fins are stretched out two inches in breadth, extended in length towards the Tail, almost a foot. The hinder-Fins are almost two inches broad, and above an inch and ½ long.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="100" facs="tcp:47321:57"/>The Tail a foot and two inches long, at the Root about an inch and ½ over, the extremity very small like a <hi>Shoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers</hi> Thread. The Skin not very thick, nor stubborn, (now) of a yellow colour on the back, on the Belly straw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colour'd: every where very smooth, excepting on his Tail, where there are some few very short prickles.</p>
                           <p>Whether this be not a young Fish, and upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count only wanteth the <hi>Radius</hi> (as the sharp Saw upon the Tail is called) to me is uncertain. With this <hi>Radius</hi> he is said to strike and kill his Prey, for which he lies as it were dormant, till it swims within his reach. <hi>Aelian,</hi> cited by <hi>Rondeletius,</hi> saith, That he sometimes flies. Which that he may do a little above the water, as the flying Fishes, seems possible by the horizontal production of all his Fins, and their extension all along his sides.</p>

                           <p>The nether LIP of the smooth CAT-FISH, two inches long.</p>
                           <p>The BRASILIAN FROG-FISH. <hi>Rana Piscatrix minor.</hi> In <hi>Brasile,</hi> GUACUACUYA. The figure which <hi>Johnston</hi> gives is tolerable; but his Description very defective. The length of this is eight inches. His Mouth open makes a Circle ¼ of an inch over. His Lips, in the usual place of Teeth, are rough; as also is his Tongue. He hath a black Horn on his Forehead, stooped forwards, round, an inch and ½ long, one third over at the bottom, pointed, and having little Spikes round about it. What <hi>Johnston</hi> means by the <hi>Cuteus Nervus,</hi> appears not. At the top of his Head, just under the Horn, stand his Eyes a ¼ of an inch over, and (here) no more distant. The Nostrils a little before the Horn.</p>
                           <p>His Body two inches and ½ long, and four broad; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>Semilunar.</hi> His Back convex, his Belly flat; with a Border or Fin all along each side ½ an inch broad. Behind are subjoyned a pair of Fins almost two inches long, and an inch and ½ wide. In the middle of his Belly are two other lesser close together, above an inch long, but not more than ¼ broad.</p>
                           <p>The length of the Tail four inches and ½. At the root 'tis round, and an inch over; at the end, with the sides com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, and ½ an inch high. The Tail-Fins three, one
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:47321:57"/>
above, another just under it, the third at the end much bigger. The Skin of his Belly and Tail underneath, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish, thin, and rough. Of his Backside, Fins, and Tail above, black, thick and set with short spikes arising from a round Base radiated like a Star. He seems, by his shape, to be near of kin to the <hi>Thornback;</hi> and therefore to be less appo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitely Nam'd.</p>
                           <p>A lesser <hi>Brasilian</hi> Frogfish of the same kind.</p>
                           <p>The TRUMPET-FISH. So called from the figure of his Bill, which is an entire Pipe, shaped almost like that of the <hi>Snipe-Fish. Acus Aristotelis.</hi> Well described by <hi>Ron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deletius;</hi> saving, that he describes the Body to be <hi>Sex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angular</hi> all along. Whereas from the Head to the <hi>Anus</hi> it is <hi>Septangular.</hi> The Scales are also engraven with small lines almost of an Elliptick figure. <hi>Salvianus</hi> errs in saying he is not scaly. Another also of the same <hi>Species.</hi>

                           <p>The HORSE-FISH. <hi>Hippocampus.</hi> A small Fish. So called, because his Head is shaped like a Horses, and his Tail divided by several Incisures, somewhat like those of <hi>Caterpillars,</hi> called <gap reason="foreign">

                              </gap>. Given by Mr. <hi>Scotto</hi> a <hi>London</hi> Merchant. It hath the same number of Fins, and in the same place, the same kind of Bill, the fore-Body <hi>Septan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular,</hi> and the Tail square, as the <hi>Trumpet-Fish.</hi> And is, therefore probably, also Viviparous: and so I have ventur'd to place it here.</p>

                           <p>A STURGEON. <hi>Acipenser.

Especially that of <hi>Salvianus,</hi> with his curious figure. The like in <hi>Besler.</hi> The parts by which he is best distinguished, are his very long and sharp Snout, his little Mouth, to be seen only when he lies on his back, and his thick and bony Scales; which stand in Rows so, as to make the Fish al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most <hi>Pentangular.</hi> The figure of most of the side Scales
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:47321:58"/>
is <hi>Rhomboidal.</hi> It is affirmed by <hi>Moufet,</hi> 
                              <note n="a" place="margin">L. de Re Cibaria.</note> That the Scales of a <hi>Sturgeon</hi> turn towards the Head; borrowing his Error herein of <hi>Pliny.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Lately, a piece of a <hi>Sturgeons</hi> Gut was shewed me by Dr. <hi>Edward Tyson,</hi> which he had cut off of a great One sent to my Lord Major. It is very thick, strong and <hi>Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.</hi> And the inner Coat made of <hi>Fibers,</hi> so loosely woven together, as to look like a Net; and that above the eighth of an inch in thickness. In which a plenteous Chyle is conveniently lodged, and thence gradually trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Lacteal Veins.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Scaliger</hi> saith <note n="b" place="margin">Exerc. 182. S. 2.</note> of the Guts of a <hi>Sturgeon,</hi> that being taken out and cut all to pieces, those pieces will still move. Which may partly depend upon their great thickness and muscularity; the like being observable in cutting the Heart and other <hi>Muscular</hi> parts of divers Animals.</p>
                           <p>The <hi>Sturgeon</hi> is taken in most great Rivers, as well as in the Sea. He hath sometimes been seen, saith <hi>Bellonius,</hi> six yards long. The bigger he is, as all other Fish, the better meat. The <hi>Italians</hi> 
                              <note n="c" place="margin">Salvian.</note> prefer the Belly before the <hi>Jole.</hi> His Liver very delicate. At <hi>Hamburge</hi> and <hi>Dantsick</hi> they eat (or did in <hi>Moufet</hi>'s time, who reports it, eat) <hi>Sturgeon</hi> roasted. In the same Author, see a most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Pickle for this Fish. The Eggs being salted and made up into a Mass, were first brought from <hi>Constantinople</hi> by the <hi>Italians,</hi> and called <hi>Caveare.</hi> Of the way of making it, see <hi>Gesner.</hi> The pickled pieces made of the <hi>Chine,</hi> are by some called <hi>Schinalia.</hi> Of the long Bag <note n="d" place="margin">Salvian.</note> which grows next the <hi>Chine,</hi> the people that live near <hi>Tanais</hi> make Glew.</p>
                           <p>The HEAD of a great STURGEON.</p>
                           <p>MOON-FISH. <hi>Mola Salviani Luna;</hi> Because the Tail-Fin is shaped like a <hi>Half-Moon,</hi> By which, and his odd trussed shape, looking as if he were only the Head of some great Fish cut off from his Trunk, he is sufficiently distinguished from all others. Well described by <hi>Rondeletius</hi> and <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian;</hi> and by this latter, very curiously pictur'd. The Gill-Fins, as he observes, are so postur'd, as not to move from Head to Tail, or <hi>vice versa,</hi> but from Back to
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:47321:58"/>
Belly, <hi>&amp; è contra.</hi> The use whereof seems to be, To ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble him to make a more direct and sudden descent; that so when any Ravenous Fish makes full speed at him, he may in an instant strike himself under his way, and so escape him. It may also be noted, That being a tall Fish, and with his sides much compressed, he hath a long Fin upon his Back, and another answering to it on his Belly: by which he is the better kept upright, or from swaging on his sides.</p>
                           <p>Another MOON-FISH of the same Species, but some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what lesser. Neither of these is above ½ a yard long. But that which <hi>Salvian</hi> describes, was above an hundred pounds weight. They are taken, as Mr. <hi>Ray</hi> saith, about St. <hi>Ives</hi> and <hi>Pensans</hi> in <hi>Cornwall.</hi>

                              <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> OF OVIPEROUS FISHES, particularly such as are NOT-SCALED.</head>
                           <p>THe HEAD of the RIVER-WHALE. <hi>Caput Siluri. Johnston</hi> gives the figure of this Fish, but without a Description. That of <hi>Rondeletius</hi> is not full. This Head is ½ a foot long, as broad, and half as high. The Snout flat. Both the Chaps before of a <hi>Semilunar</hi> figure. Armed with an innumerable company of prickly Teeth, standing like those in a <hi>Card</hi> wherewith Women Comb Wooll. The nether Chap stands out above an inch before the upper. The Eyes round, and for such a Head, very small, scarce the third of an inch over. Distant three inches and ½. An inch above the corners of his Mouth, he hath two strings, smooth and round, here (for they are broken) ½ a foot long, about the thickness of an <hi>Earth-Worm,</hi> taper'd and bended backward; outwardly nervous, inwardly Cartila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginous or Grisly. His Gills descending almost from the top of his Head, meet under his Throat.</p>
                           <p>What may be the use of these strings is uncertain, and to be collected only from observing their communication with other parts, and the manners of the Fish. But the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:47321:59"/>
intent of their structure is less obscure; the Nervous part serving to draw it too and fro; the Cartilage, as the spring in a <hi>Pendulum</hi> Watch, to stint the motion and make it more steady. And being flexible, it does the same as a joynted Series of many little Bones.</p>
                           <p>The little SEA-UNICORNE. <hi>Monoceros minor.</hi> It was sent from <hi>Brasile,</hi> I find it not described nor pictur'd in any Author. Nor is it certain whether it be Ovipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous. Yet I have ventur'd to place, and shall describe it here.</p>
                           <p>'Tis ½ a yard long, almost ¼ high, with its sides very much compressed, being not above two inches and a ½ over. High-Bac'd, like a <hi>Perch.</hi> And also (which is unusual) bow-Belli'd. His Head hath some resemblance to that of a <hi>Baboone;</hi> from the top to the bottom four inches and ½. His Mouth, which stands below, not much above an inch over. His Teeth, in both Chaps, the thickness of a midling Needle, the eight of an inch long. His Gills subtended to his Eyes and Mouth like the segment of a Circle. His Eyes stand near the top of his Head; and are an inch over.</p>
                           <p>From the top is prolonged a smooth (now) blackish, round, taper'd, strait Horn, couched a little down below the level, two inches round about the Root, and three inches long. It seemeth not to have any Bone within it; nor is it inserted into any, as in the <hi>Unicorne</hi> of the Cetace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous kind before described; but is the Skin it self prolonged and hardened (as the <hi>Cuticula</hi> turns to <hi>Cornes</hi>) into a kind of horn.</p>
                           <p>The Fins are seven. The Gill-Fins two inches long, and one broad. The Back-Fin is extended from Head to Tail, above an inch and ½ high. The Breast-Fins ¼ of an inch before the <hi>Anus,</hi> near two inches long. The Belly-Fin, like that of the Back, and extended from the <hi>Anus</hi> to the end of the Tail. That at the end of the Tail <hi>triangular,</hi> two inches and ½ long, three high. The <hi>Anus,</hi> if you measure by a perpendicular from the Gills, opens, oddly, not above an inch and ½ behind them. He is cover'd with a (now) blackish, thick and tough Skin, and when you draw your hand forward, also rough.</p>
                           <p>The SHIPHALTER. <hi>Echeneis. Remora. Johnston</hi> hath
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:47321:59"/>
given an indifferent figure of it. But I meet with no tolerable Description any where.</p>
                           <p>'Tis about ¼ of a yard long. His Body before, three inches and ½ over; thence tapering to the Tail-end. His Mouth two inches and ½ over. His Chaps ending some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what angularly. The nether a little broader, and produced forward near an inch more than the upper. His Lips rough with a great number of little prickles. His Eyes round, ¼ of an inch over, an inch behind his Mouth.</p>
                           <p>His Head squat, adorned with a kind of Oval <hi>Coronet,</hi> somewhat Concave, five inches and ½ long, above two broad, cut traversly with three and twenty Incisions or long Apertures, making so many distinct Membranes, with rough edges, joyned altogether with a Ligament running through the middle of the <hi>Coronet,</hi> and perforated on each side the Ligament.</p>
                           <p>The Gills wind from an inch and ½ behind the Eyes down to the Throat. The Fins seven. The Gill-Fins above four inches long; The Breast-Fins as long. About a ¼ of a yard behind the <hi>Coronet</hi> a fifth extended on the Back above ¼ of a yard. A sixth like it on the Belly. The Tail-end, like a Spear, a little compressed. The Tail-Fin three inches and ½ long. The <hi>Anus</hi> open about the middle of the Fish. His Skin is (now) brown, smooth, and tough, or like tan'd Leather.</p>
                           <p>Perhaps the same Fish, which <hi>Ligon</hi> 
                              <note n="a" place="margin">
                                 <hi>Hist. of</hi> Barbadoes.</note> saith, always swims along with the <hi>Shark,</hi> and frequently sticks to some part about his Head. At least, it is very probable, that this Fish is able to fasten himself to any great Fish, Boat, or Ship, with the help of the <hi>Coronet</hi> or <hi>Sucker</hi> on his Head; which seems to be most fitly contrived for that purpose. In some sort answerable to the Tail of a <hi>Leech,</hi> whereby she sticks her self fast to the smoothest Glass. Or to those round Leathers, wherewith Boys are us'd to play, called <hi>Suckers,</hi> one of which, not above an inch and ½ diametre, being well soaked in water, will stick so fast to a Stone, as to pluck one of twelve or fourteen pounds up from the ground.</p>
                           <p>Of the stupendious power which this Fish is supposed to have, there are many concur in the story; as that he is able to stop a Ship in its career under full Sail: and what not?
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:47321:60"/>
and great pains is taken to assign the Cause; and to prove, That though the <hi>Moon</hi> be made of a <hi>Green Cheese,</hi> yet is not the only Nest of <hi>Maggots. Rondeletius</hi> alone, in ascribing it to his easily altering the position of the Helm, and so the motion of the Ship, coming near to good sense: especially if he had proved, That the Name of the Fish, and the Story, were not Things much older than the Helm of a Ship.</p>
                           <p>'Tis plain, that the Tradition had a very early beginning, when little light Boats were the Ships which people us'd. To the side whereof, this Fish fastening her self, might easily make it swag, as the least preponderance on either side will do, and so retard its Course. And the Story once begot upon a Boat, might still, like the Fish it self, stick to it, though turn'd to a Ship. Assigning as great a power to this <hi>Neptune</hi> in the Sea, as the Poets have done to <hi>Apollo</hi> the God of Life in the Heavens; who yet appears by the best accounts of him put together, to have been at first no better than a Crafty <hi>Mountebank.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The TOBACCOPIPE-FISH. By the People of <hi>Brasile,</hi> and by <hi>Marggravius</hi> who describes it, called <hi>Petimbuaba.</hi> He hath only omitted the Line, which, like a very small Chain, runs along both sides, as in the <hi>Sea-Scorpion,</hi> from Head to Tail: Both the Body and Snout are long and slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, from whence its Name. 'Tis also pictur'd, and in some sort described by <hi>Piso.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The PRICKLED TURBUT. <hi>Rhombus aculeatus.</hi> So called from his figure and the prickles on his Back or brown side. Described by <hi>Rondeletius.</hi> The two strings that hang at the nether Chap, are here wanting. He is said, having hid himself in Mud, with these, to Prey upon little Fish, which seeing them rigle, make at them, supposing them to be Weeds.</p>
                           <p>The little GLOB-FISH. <hi>Orbis minor.</hi> So called from his Orbicular figure. Described in most <hi>Musaeums.</hi> Most curiously figur'd in that of <hi>Calceolarius.</hi> He is armed with long, round, hard, and sharp Spikes or Needles all round about, almost like those of a <hi>Hedg-Hog;</hi> and is a sort of <hi>Porcupine-Fish.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>'Tis probable, That the Fish swims with these Needles all closely couched down round about, for that otherwise
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:47321:60"/>
they would hinder her swimming. But if at any time she is pursu'd, she immediately advances her Pikes, and bids the enemy come at his peril.</p>
                           <p>This and the other kinds are found, especially, in the River <hi>Nile.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The SEA-PORCUPINE. <hi>Histrix Piscis. Johnston</hi> hath figur'd it (<hi>Tab.</hi> 45.) but not well. Neither do I find any tolerable Description of it.</p>
                           <p>This here is above a foot long, near half a foot over, and as high, round, and almost of an Ovale figure. His Chaps about ½ an inch long, shaped somewhat like the Bill of a <hi>Sparrow,</hi> each of them one single Bone, without any Teeth, but sharp-edged; at the corners of the Mouth an inch over. His Eyes ½ an inch over, an inch behind his Mouth, and two and ½ distant.</p>
                           <p>The Gills but ¼ of an inch long, Convex before, very high, <hi>viz.</hi> in the same level with the Eye. As also the Gill-Fins, which are about two inches long, and three broad. Two inches and ½ before the end of the Tail, a third an inch and ¼ broad and two inches long. An inch and ½ be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the end of the Tail underneath, a fourth somewhat less. The Tail-Fin above two inches long, an inch and ½ high, with its extream edge Convex.</p>
                           <p>He is cover'd with a Skin on the Back (now) of a brownish yellow, on the Belly whitish. Armed all round about, excepting his Tail, with round, hard, and most sharp Needles, about an inch and ¼ long, ½ an inch distant one from another, each having three Roots (now) visibly spread under the Skin, one on each side, and a third before.</p>
                           <p>'Tis most probable, That to these Roots are fasten'd so many <hi>Muscules,</hi> whereby these little Pikes are govern'd in their motion, and kept steady in their posture of defence.</p>
                           <p>Another SEA-PORCUPINE like the former.</p>
                           <p>The FROG-GLOB-FISH. <hi>Orbis Batrachoides.</hi> Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gur'd by <hi>Johnston</hi> under the Title of <hi>Gestachelt meer Taube, Tab.</hi> 24. But I find it not described to any pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</p>
                           <p>This is seven inches long, three broad, and as high. His Forehead above an inch and ½ over, by the eminency
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:47321:61"/>
of his Eye-Brows a little hollow. His Eyes round, above ½ an inch over. His Mouth very broad and semilunar, like that of a <hi>Frog;</hi> from whence I take leave for his Name. His nether Chap a little broad and more forward than the upper. Without any Teeth, but rough like a File. The Gills ½ an inch long, an inch and ¼ behind the Eyes. The Fins are five. The Gill-Fins above an inch long, almost as broad. Before the end of the Tail, one above about an inch long, that underneath broken off. The Tail-Fin above ½ an inch long, near as high. The <hi>Anus</hi> opens an inch and quarter before the Tail-end.</p>
                           <p>He is cover'd all over with a very hard and tough Skin, (now) of a yellowish straw-colour. Armed round about with strong Spikes about ¼ of an inch long, couched back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and fixed with three Roots, as in the former. But not, as those, round, but flat with two edges like the point of a Sword.</p>
                           <p>It may further be noted of these Spikes, That being fixed in the Skin, both here and in the other kinds, so as to couch and point backward, the fish needs not to tack about, but is at the same time in a posture of defence, and of flight, for its surer escape.</p>
                           <p>The EGYPTIAN GLOB-FISH. It differs from the rest, especially by the smallness of its Prickles, which are rather like the little Thorns on a young <hi>Rasperry-Bush.</hi> He is not armed with them, as <hi>Rondeletius</hi> saith, all over; the Skin behind the Gills for the length of ¼ of an inch, and on the lower part of the Tail, being bald.</p>
                           <p>The HARE-GLOB-FISH. <hi>Orbis Lagocephalus.</hi> I find it not any where pictur'd or describ'd. 'Tis above a foot long, ½ a foot high, almost five over. His Head almost like a <hi>Hares,</hi> from whence I have Nam'd him. His Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head plain and almost square, an inch and ¼ broad. His Eyes round, above ¼ of an inch over, and stand high. Three quarters of an inch before the Eyes, two holes like Nostrils. From thence to the Nose-end a little above an inch. The end above ½ an inch over, and round. His up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Lip stretched thence to the breadth of ½ an inch. Each Chap as it were divided into two great Teeth ¼ of an inch broad.</p>
                           <p>The Gills an inch and ¼ long, behind the Eyes an inch,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:47321:61"/>
below them ½ an inch. The Fins are five. The Gill-Fins stand obliquely between the Back and the Breast, an inch and ½ long, and three broad. Three inches before the Tail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>end, a third almost two inches long and one broad. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath, a fourth somewhat less. This, which may be noted, being couched backward, the other foreward. The Tail-Fin two inches and ½ long, and as high, with its utmost edge Convex.</p>
                           <p>His Skin Membranous and limber, on the top of his Head, Back, upper Sides and Breast, and round about his Tail, smooth and bald. On his Belly and lower part of his Sides and Breast, armed with little short Prickles, about the third of an inch distant, and fixed with little Roots, as in the former.</p>
                           <p>From the Crown of his Head are drawn two Lines al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most to those holes like Nostrils. From the hinder part of the Head, two more all along the Back and Tail, in the figure of the Letter <hi>s.</hi> And two others from the Gill-Fins towards the <hi>Anus,</hi> and from thence to the end of the Tail. By these Lines, were there no other marks, it is easie to distinguish him from all the other <hi>Species.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>An OVAL COMPAGES of BONES, said to be the <hi>Sceleton</hi> of a <hi>Globe-Fish.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The RED-GOURNET. <hi>Pavo Salviani. Cuculus,</hi> from the noise he makes like a <hi>Cuckow</hi> when he is taken. Well described by <hi>Rondeletius.</hi> But his figure, especially in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him with a long Snout, answers not, unless it be of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Species.</hi> For the Forehead of this is square, and the Head almost cubical, like that of the <hi>Scorpion-Fish.</hi> From which this chiefly differs in not having the Fins of the Back prickly or spiked, and having a Line running from the top of the Back on each side the Back-Fin to the Tail, like a small linked Chain.</p>
                           <p>The LONG-SNOUTED GOURNET. <hi>Cuculus Ron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deletii.</hi> By which Author 'tis well described. It differs from the former <hi>Species,</hi> chiefly, in having a much longer head, and a saddle-Nose.</p>
                           <p>The STAR-GAZER. <hi>Uranoscopus.</hi> Because he looks directly against the Sky: whereas, as <hi>Rondeletius</hi> observes, the <hi>Ray</hi> and several other fishes, although they have their Eyes standing on the top of their Heads, yet the Pupils of
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:47321:62"/>
their Eyes are not directed upwards, but side-ways. The Fish is accurately described by the same Author. Saving, that he hath omitted the arching or bowing of his Body with the Head and Tail upwards: unless both the shape of the Fish here be forced, and his own figure thereof false.</p>
                           <p>This Fish, when alive, hath a slender Membranous string, which he projects and draws in, at pleasure, as a <hi>Serpent</hi> doth his Tongue. With this he duckoys little fishes, and then preys upon them. For plunging himself in Mud (<hi>Ron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deletius</hi> saith, he hath seen him) and then lifting up his head a little, he casts out the said string; which the little fishes taking for a Worm, and nibling at it, he immediately plucks them both in together.</p>
                           <p>The SQUAR-FISH. <hi>Piscis quadrangularis.</hi> I think it is not described or figur'd by any. There are two square fishes described by <hi>Wormius,</hi> the former of which he sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth to be made so, not bred. But neither is this, as that is, spiked behind; nor as the other, horned before, besides other differences: 'Twas sent from the <hi>East-Indies.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>'Tis about fifteen inches long, four high, in the middle three and ½ over. His Forehead square, by the eminency of the Eye-brows, a little hollow; two inches and ½ over. His Eyes near an inch. His Nose blunt, not very steep, an inch and ½ long. Two small holes in the place of Nostrils. His Mouth exceeding little, ½ an inch over. His Teeth also very small.</p>
                           <p>The Gills are strait, an inch and ¼ long. His back a little Convex; towards his Tail, and on his sides blunt angled. So also his Belly, but plain or flat; and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derably rising up towards his Tail. He hath five Fins. The Gill-Fins are two inches in length, and two in breadth. They stand a little obliquely. Like these, a little before the Tail, one above, another under. The Tail-Fin three inches long, and three and ½ high.</p>
                           <p>Some part of both the Chaps and of the Tail are cover'd only with a Skin. The rest of the fish with a kind of Crust: yet not altogether so hard as in the Crustaceous kind. This Crust is all over adorned with innumerable little round knobs reduced, for the most part, into hexagonal figures, subdivided into equilateral Triangles.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="111" facs="tcp:47321:62"/>
                              <hi>Wormius</hi> calls this Crust a Leathery Skin: but not rightly; as any one that compares it with the true Skin upon his Chaps and Tail, whereof he takes no notice, may easily judge. That it may be bent, proves it not a Skin; for so may the Crust of a <hi>Lobster.</hi> To which this seemeth to stand in the next degree, as that doth to a shell. Or to speak properly, it seems neither a Skin, nor a Crust alone, but a Medly of both together, or a Crust upon a Skin: Nature having here, as in many other examples, united two extreams by a third Thing in the middle.</p>
                           <p>Another SQUARE FISH stained with black Spots. Given by Mr. <hi>John Short.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The CONEY-FISH. <hi>Piscis Triangularis.</hi> Described by <hi>Marggravius. Wormius</hi> also supposeth his first <hi>Square-Fish</hi> to be the same. But neither of them are particular enough.</p>
                           <p>'Tis above ½ a yard long, above ½ a foot high, the Belly flat, and almost ½ a foot over. From whence his sides rise up into a sharp Angle. His Head somewhat like that of a <hi>Coney;</hi> from whence his Name. His Eyes great, <hi>sc.</hi> an inch and ½ long; and stand high. His Forehead almost square, and by the eminency of the Eye-brows a little hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; an inch and ¼ broad. Half an inch before the Eyes two little holes like Nostrils. His Nose descending almost perpendicularly, three inches deep, and blunt-ended. His Mouth not above an inch over. The Teeth ⅓ of an inch long, and sharp: ten in the lower Chap, in the upper twelve. His Back arched between the Head and Tail, and, as is said, very sharp. On each side his Belly he hath a strong sharp Spike ⅓ of an inch long, standing near, and pointing toward his Tail.</p>
                           <p>His Gills are strait, above an inch long, and parallel to his Nose. The Fins five. The Gill-Fins here broken off. A little before his Tail, one above, another below, both two inches long, an inch and ½ broad. The Tail-Fin three inches long, and two and ½ high. Excepting his Chaps and Tail, which are naked, he is cover'd all over with the like Crust, as the former. On the upper part of the Tail, also grows a distinct Crust, of an Oval figure.</p>
                           <p>The Chaps and Tail of this Fish, and the rest of the kind, are both left naked, for the more easie and convenient
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:47321:63"/>
motion of the one in eating, and of the other in swim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming. And for the same reason, the Gill-Fins do also stand upon a naked Membrane.</p>
                           <p>The Female-CONEY-FISH. The Nose here descendeth not so steeply. The Belly not so broad. The Crust every where, except the middle of the Belly, stained with a great number of round black Spots. Hath not many of the triangular subdivisions. Nor the Oval Crust upon the Tail.</p>
                           <p>Another of the same <hi>Species,</hi> with that now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed.</p>
                           <p>The HORNED CONEY-FISH. <hi>Piscis triangularis cornutus. Johnston</hi> hath figur'd it. <note n="a" place="margin">Tab. 45.</note> But without either Description or Name. It differs from the fish last described chiefly by its Horns, which he hath upon the top of his Forehead, ½ an inch long, near an inch about the bottom, and pointed; almost like an Horses Ears when he pricks them forward. His Teeth are also smaller, his Mouth lesser, and more naked. His Belly narrower, and so his sides more compressed. The Tail-Fin longer. And the Oval Crust on the Tail, not above but beneath.</p>
                           <p>ANOTHER of the same <hi>Species,</hi> with two Oval-Crusts, one on the top of the Tail, the other underneath.</p>
                           <p>A THIRD, without the said Oval-Crust, and the triangu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar subdivisions.</p>

                           <p>THe HEAD of the CUCUPU-GUACU; so called by the people of <hi>Brasile,</hi> where it breeds. Described by <hi>Marggravius.</hi> Who saith it is sometimes two yards long, and a yard and half about. The Mouth of this Head standing quite open, makes a circle of a yard in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass. So that, probably, 'tis the biggest of <hi>Scaled-Fishes,</hi>
                              <pb n="113" facs="tcp:47321:63"/>
excepting the <hi>Sturgeon.</hi> Of all our <hi>European</hi> Fishes, it seems to come nearest to the <hi>Cole-Fish</hi> or <hi>Black-Cod.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The SCALES (perhaps) of the same Fish. They are almost circular, above three inches in Diameter, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerably thick. Like other Scales, they are horny, trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, and elastick or springy. That part of their edge which is inserted into the Skin, bluntly Toothed. They have a great many exceeding small <hi>Striae,</hi> hardly visible, but by holding them up against the light.</p>
                           <p>The FILE-FISH. CAPRISCUS. It was sent from the <hi>Bermudas.</hi> Curiously pictur'd and described by <hi>Salvian.</hi> 
                              <note n="a" place="margin">Hist. 71.</note> I call it the <hi>File-Fish,</hi> from the likeness which the foremost Bone upon his Back hath to a file. There are three of them: which, saith <hi>Salvian,</hi> he raises and depresses at his pleasure; yet so, as not one alone, but altogether. And although you press the foremost, and greatest never so hard, it will not stir: but if you depress the last and least of all never so softly, the other two immediately fall down with it: just as when a <hi>Cross-Bow</hi> is let off by pulling down the Tricker. For which reason also the fish is called, at <hi>Rome, Pesce Balestra.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Another thing peculiar to this fish is, that his Scales (as <hi>Salvian</hi> calls them) are separated by cancellated lines, or Lattice-wise. I add, and that they are all incrustated, and rough-cast with little round knobs. So that the cover of this fish, is near a kin to that of the <hi>Square-Fish;</hi> that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only <hi>one entire Crust,</hi> this divided into <hi>many little ones.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>It may be noted, That where <hi>Salvian</hi> describeth this fish to be <hi>compressum &amp; latum, at<expan>

                           <p>This fish seems to be the same which the People of <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sile</hi> call GUAPERUA; described and pictur'd by <hi>Marg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravius</hi> and <hi>Piso,</hi> and out of them by <hi>Johnston.</hi>

                           <p>The TALLEST FILE-FISH. This seems to be that <hi>Species</hi> particularly described by <hi>Salvianus.</hi> It differs from the foregoing only in being taller and narrower: and in having the Tail-Fin with longer horns.</p>
                           <p>The PRICKLE or longest FILE-FISH. It is a young
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:47321:64"/>
One. Differs from that of <hi>Salvian.</hi> In that on the sides hinderly, grows a little short Prickle upon the centre of every Scale, pointing backward. It is also ratably much longer and lower, his Nose a great deal shorter, and less steep, and his Tail-Fin less spread.</p>
                           <p>Another LONG-FILE-FISH of the same <hi>Species,</hi> and about a foot in length. But the Prickles above-said are here worn off.</p>
                           <p>The STREAKED FILE-FISH. <hi>Capriscus striatus.</hi> This differs from the last, In that its Scales are not prickled, but streaked with many small Lines; forward, entire; but hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly composed of many little knobs.</p>
                           <p>The SNIPE-FISH. <hi>Scolopax.</hi> It was taken in the <hi>Baltick</hi>-Sea. I find it no where well described.</p>
                           <p>It is a little fish, when at full growth, as <hi>Rondeletius,</hi> who had seen three of them all small, and full of Eggs, well observes. This here, about three inches and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

in the living fish. He is scaly, and rough with a single Row of very small Prickles near his Eyes, with a treble one on his Belly and Sides; hardly visible without a Glass.</p>
                           <p>By the great length and structure of this Fishes Bill, he should seem, upon dilating his Throat at his pleasure, to suck in his food, and so to use it as a <hi>Sirynge.</hi> Withall, his Mouth not being open before, but on the top of his Bill-end, like a Gutter-Trough, doth much promote the current, of all that comes in at it, to his Throat. And so in the <hi>Trumpet-Fish.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The three Spikes on his Back (whereof <hi>Rondeletius</hi> and others only observe the greatest) being associated in the same manner, and having the like mutual proportion, as in the <hi>File-Fish;</hi> it may reasonably be supposed, that they have also the same Motions, depressions and erections, as, in speaking of the said fish, hath been described. And that therefore, while the fish swims secure, they are all couched down close to his Back, that they may not hinder his course: but that when ever he is pursued, he strait erects them all, and by the help of the lesser, keeps the great one tite up against his Enemy.</p>
                           <p>The SQUARE ACARAUNA; by Mariners, <hi>The Old Wife.</hi> It hath some marks of kindred with the tall <hi>Acarau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> described and pictur'd in <hi>Marggravius</hi> and <hi>Piso.</hi> But hath also divers others of distinction from it; as the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent position of the <hi>Spurs,</hi> the different shape both of Head, Body and Tail, &amp;c. as may be observed by comparing the Descriptions and Figures of both together.

                           <p>The Gills behind make a strait Line, and an Angle, from whence they are produced forward. The Fins seven.

                           <p>The SWALLOW-FISH. So called from the length of his Gill-Fins, which reach to the end of his Tail, like a pair of very long Wings. By some, the <hi>Flying-Herring,</hi> from a likeness in the shape of their Body. Perhaps <hi>Ronde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letius's Mugilis Alatus.</hi> But by <hi>Salvian</hi> called <hi>Hirundo,</hi> by whom it is well described. <note n="a" place="margin">Histor. 62.</note> That Line (saith he) which in other fishes goes either from the Head or <hi>Branchiae</hi> by the sides to the Tail; here runs from the Belly-Fins along the Belly to the Tail. <hi>Johnston</hi> also describes it out of <hi>Aldrovandus,</hi> but omits the just number of seven Fins. In the figure also which he gives, the Belly-Fins are wanting. And the <hi>Orbits</hi> of the Eyes, which are extraordinary great, he representeth little.</p>
                           <p>His Gill-Fins he useth as Wings, wherewith he flyeth, for escape, above the water, when pursu'd by another fish; especially, as <hi>Piso</hi> saith, by the <hi>Dolphin.</hi> But as they fly (as the same Author) they often become a prey to <hi>Water-Fowl.</hi> Hundreds of them are sometimes seen above the

                           <p>KITE-FISH. So called also from his Wings or Gill-Fins, which, what they want in length, they have in breadth and strength. Figur'd by <hi>Rondeletius,</hi> and accurately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed. Saving, that he mentions but seven of his eight Fins.</p>
                           <p>This fish seems to be the same with that which <hi>Marggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius</hi> describes by the Name of PIRAPEBE.</p>

                           <p>Of the GILL-FINS of the FLYING-FISH, it is further observable, That they are fastened very high near their Backs; that so at the same time their Bodies may be in some part sustained by the Water, and their Wings have a little scope to play above it, for their easier advance into the Air.</p>

                           <p>One half of the Gills opens on the sides, the other under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath in the Breast. The Fins are eight. The Gill-Fins of an unusual structure, having their utmost Spine or Bone very rough, thick and strong, above an inch and ½ long, flat and crooked, almost like a <hi>Reaping-Hook,</hi> seven or eight times as big as any of the rest of the Fin-Bones. The Belly-Fins much less, and above an inch behind. Just over these the Back-Fin. On the Tail one above, underneath, and at the end: But the two first are here broken off.</p>
                           <p>His Head is cover'd with a brown and rough bony Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met.

His Breast and Belly only with a thin limber Skin.</p>
                           <p>The BRASILIAN NEEDLE-FISH; by the People of <hi>Brasile</hi> called TIMUCU. <hi>Acus Brasiliensis. Marggravius</hi> hath described and figur'd it well. 'Tis a long slender fish, from whence its Name. It hath also a pair of Chaps like a long Bill. He only omits the two scaly Lines which run along the Belly and Tail of the Fish, which every where else hath a naked Skin.</p>
                           <p>The CHAPS (perhaps) of the GREENLAND NEEDLE-FISH. The Teeth which stand in single Rows on the Edges of the Chaps are thick and strong, yet very sharp. In the lower Chap, near the two edges, are two furrows, into which the Teeth of the upper Chap strike. The two Bones which compose the Chap, are joyned together by an indented Suture, most curious to look upon. The fish seems next a kin to the common great <hi>Needle-Fish,</hi> or the <hi>Girrock,</hi> which is described by <hi>Rondeletius, Aldrovandus,</hi> and others, and pictur'd by <hi>Johnston, Tab.</hi> 15.</p>

                           <p>This fish, instead of the Plates on the Tail of a common <hi>Lobster,</hi> hath so many Fins, which for the far greater part of them are naked, or without a Crust upon them.</p>
                           <p>All <hi>Lobsters</hi> use their Tails, as Fins, wherewith they commonly swim backward by Jirks or Springs; reaching sometimes ten yards at a Spring. For which purpose, whereas the Gill-Fins of other fishes, which are their Oars, are a little Concave backward; these have the Plates of their Tails when they bend them down, as they use to do, a little Concave forwards.</p>
                           <p>Another HORNED-LOBSTER with a smoother Back. These fishes are the most pleasant meat of all the Crustaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous kind; except perhaps the Punger.</p>

And to what <hi>Wormius</hi> saith, I also add, the position of the Eyes; for from <hi>Clusius</hi>'s Description, it would follow, that they stood in the hinder part of the <hi>Crab.</hi> Here are eight or nine of them; the entirest and largest, given by <hi>Henry Whistler</hi>

                           <p>The Eye of this <hi>Crab,</hi> hath a horny Cover. But stands almost flat, or in the same plain with the rest of the shell. 'Tis pleasant to look on, being latticed like the Eye of a <hi>Butterfly.</hi> The latticed-work is discernable to a naked Eye, but much better through a Glass.</p>

                           <p>The CLAW of the PUNGER, or the VELVET-CRAB, called <hi>Pagurus.</hi> It is one of the biggest sort; and the best meat of any. <hi>Linschoten</hi> reports, That some (but he saith not of what kind) in <hi>India,</hi> have been found so big, that whensoever they got any man with in their Claws, it cost him his life.</p>

Each of these, are again subdivided into lesser and lesser Branches. The last whereof, are scarce thicker than a Horse-Hair. In number, by a moderate estimate, above a Thousand.</p>
                           <p>As he swims, he spreads and stretches out all his Branches to their full length; but so soon as he perceives the Prey

                           <p>The PRICKLED STAR-FISH. <hi>Stella marina hirsuta.</hi> Perhaps <hi>Rondeletius's Pectinata prima.</hi> It hath five Arms, each Arm pointed, and also slender or narrowed next the Trunk, but spread in the middle. Two inches and ¼ long; the Trunk it self not above ½ an inch Diametre. The upper part hath a rough shag of short Prickles; the other, of longer: where also the Arms are furrow'd. These innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable Prickles upon their Arms, are all movable, as in the <hi>Sea-Hedg-Hog.</hi>

                           <p>Three more PRICKLED STAR-FISHES; which indifferently answer the second, third, and fourth of <hi>Ron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deletius.</hi>

                           <p>The CROWN'D-STAR-FISH. <hi>Stella marina Coronalis.</hi> It was taken in the <hi>Danish</hi>-Sea. I meet not with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription any where.

The upper part rises up like a Crown, adorned with round Knobs of the bigness of a green Peas, with other little ones, on both sides like Pins heads, ranged into five even Rows from the ends of the Arms to the top of the <hi>Star;</hi> in some sort, as precious Stones are set upon a Royal Crown: from whence I have named it. The spaces also between them are beset with little knobs. The edges of the Arms and Sides are in like manner set round about with lesser upon greater. Underneath, the furrows of the five Arms meet in the middle, paved with little Stones almost like Teeth; the broad Margins, with other round knobs or stones.</p>
                           <p>These <hi>Stones,</hi> are in colour, substance, and nature con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generous, with those which are commonly called <hi>Crabs-Eyes.</hi>

                           <p>The HIGH-CROWN'D STAR-FISH. It differs from the former, in being much taller, and in having no Knobs, but only Spikes, the one half whereof are ranged into certain correspondent Orders.</p>

                           <p>THere is a large Treasure of Shells in this <hi>Musaeum:</hi> in all, great and small, about six hundred. The Reduction of all which to the Order of Nature, whoever shall go about, will find to be no little Task. Nor can it be perfectly done here, because as yet the Collection it self is not perfect. According to the best Method I can at present think of, I shall here place them. And that it may be the better judged, how far it is natural, or not, I shall afterwards digest them into Schemes. Most of them are Strangers in <hi>England</hi> and the <hi>British</hi>-Seas, and therefore I must be allowed a little more than ordinary liberty for the <hi>English</hi> Names.</p>
                           <p>Note, That when I speak of the Right or Left Lip of a Shell, I mean, as it is held with the Mouth down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
                           <p>The FROG-WILK. <hi>Murex Coracoides.</hi> Described and pictur'd by <hi>Johnston</hi> out of others. As are also most of those that follow, which are only named. It hath three Appendices on each side, like fingers or feet, and one at the end.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="125" facs="tcp:47321:69"/>The BROAD-LIPP'D WILK. <hi>Aporrhais.</hi> The Lips of this are pale and even. Of this kind, three great Ones are here preserved, one of them above a foot in length.</p>
                           <p>The BROAD-LIP'D WILK, with wrinkled Lips, and dyed with a deep purple. See a curious figure of this in <hi>Calceolarius</hi>'s <hi>Musaeum,</hi> 
                              <note n="a" place="margin">Sect. 1.</note> under the Title of <hi>Conchilium Muricatum.</hi> This Shell, saith <hi>Cerutus,</hi> 
                              <note n="b" place="margin">Ibid.</note> the <hi>Indians</hi> use as a Trumpet, both in their Wars, and in Hunting.</p>
                           <p>The MARBLE WILK. <hi>Murex marmoreus,</hi> from its mixed colours, which make it look like spoted Marble. Of these, here are five.</p>
                           <p>The ORIENTAL WILK. <hi>Murex Orientalis.</hi> The right Lip of this is even. Here are four great Shells of this sort, near a foot in length.</p>
                           <p>Another ORIENTAL WILK, with the right Lip undulated.</p>
                           <p>Betwixt the three sorts of Shells above mentioned, there is this difference, That the right Lip of that commonly call'd <hi>The Oriental,</hi> is only expanded; that of the marbled, expanded or spread, and turned outward; of the <hi>Broad-Lip'd,</hi> spread outward, and as it were Finger'd.</p>
                           <p>A SHELL like the ORIENTAL, with a KNOBED Turban or Whirle.</p>
                           <p>Another of the same sort with an EVEN Whirle. It is a small shell, not above an inch and ¼ long. Forward, somewhat flat, and white as Milk. Hinderly, stained with tauny spots. The left Lip is turned or spread out. The right, at the bottom wrinkled, and stained with a light purple. Towards the Cone or fore Corner, is gather'd into an open Angle. The <hi>Whirle</hi> is smooth, not very high, maketh six Rounds.</p>
                           <p>The LONG-MOUTH'D WILK. <hi>Murex Labris paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lelis.</hi> Both the Lips of this are plain or even on the Surface. I call it <hi>Long-Mouth'd,</hi> because the Mouths of all that have been nam'd before, are very wide.</p>
                           <p>The LONG-MOUTH'D WILK, with oblique furrows on the left Lip. Here are four of this sort: whereof one is near ½ a foot long. Each of the inner Rounds of the <hi>Whirle</hi> or <hi>Turban,</hi> is one third part lesser than that next without it.</p>
                           <p>The SPIKED-WILK. <hi>Murex Aculeatus.</hi> This, of all
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:47321:70"/>
the rest, hath the Name, <hi>Murex,</hi> most properly given it; from the spiked Instrument used in War, so called. The Spikes of this are round. Here are three of these Shells, one of which is ¼ of a foot long. Well figur'd by <hi>Olearius.</hi> 
                              <note n="a" place="margin">Tab. 32. f. 5.</note> And better by <hi>Besler.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The SPIKED-WILK, with doubled or PLAITED Spikes. Here are two of this sort, one of them near ½ a foot long. Both the Lips are a little drawn outward, and so the Mouth almost Oval, both the corners thereof pretty long, the left Lip spread outward, the right wrinkled; the main Body somewhat Conical, the <hi>Whirle</hi> low, consisting of six Rounds; both striated, and armed with plated Spikes standing in a spiral Order.</p>
                           <p>The BOSSED or KNOBED-WILK. In the place of spikes it hath round knobs. Here are five or six, all lesser ones, about the length of a <hi>Katharine-Pear;</hi> so that 'tis probable they grow not much bigger.</p>
                           <p>The CONICK SNAIL. <hi>Cochlea Cylindrica;</hi> so it is commonly called by <hi>Zoographers,</hi> but very improperly, the figure hereof being Conical. Here are about fourteen of this sort. Whereof some have a plain, others a knobed <hi>Turban.</hi> Some are all over white, or yellowish, others are stained white and black, or blackish-bay, white and brown, or white and yellowish. In some the colours are laid in spots, in others undulated, and in some others Lattice-wise. <hi>Rondeletius</hi> saies, That this Shell seldom exceeds the thickness of the <hi>Thumb.</hi> Yet one of these is above ½ a foot long, and the Base above three inches over. The rest are small, all of them plain <hi>Cylinders.</hi> Not unelegantly express'd in some variety of figures by <hi>Olearius, Tab.</hi> 31. <hi>and Fig.</hi> 3. <hi>of Tab.</hi> 32.</p>
                           <p>The <hi>Whirle</hi> maketh nine or ten Rounds: which hold the same proportion one to another, as in the <hi>Long-Mouth'd Wilk.</hi> In the Kingdom of <hi>Congi,</hi> and some other places in the <hi>East-Indies,</hi> these Shells go for Money.</p>
                           <p>The CONICK SNAIL a little convex, and with the Rounds of the <hi>Turban</hi> also convex.</p>
                           <p>Another Convex Conick Snail, with the Rounds of the <hi>Turban</hi> Concave.</p>
                           <p>The GREAT PERSIAN WILK. <hi>Concha Persica major.</hi> Of this sort there are four here preserved, of which, two are above ½ a foot long.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="127" facs="tcp:47321:70"/>This <hi>Wilk</hi> yields a purple juyce, anciently used for deying. The Cover of this Shell is called <hi>Onyx</hi> or <hi>Unguis,</hi> because in shape like the Claw of a Carniverous Bird. The best of these <hi>Opercula</hi> or Covers are found in and brought from the <hi>Red-Sea.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The lesser PERSIAN WILK, with furrow'd Lips. Of this sort there are five here preserved of a middle size. The <hi>Great Persian Wilk</hi> is knobed, and hath only one Series of wrinckles. This even, and with a double Series of wrinckles a cross one to the other. Each of the outer Rounds of the <hi>Whirle</hi> is double the thickness of the next within it.</p>
                           <p>The lesser PERSIAN WILK with even Lips. 'Tis a small shell, scarce bigger than the Kernel of a <hi>Filbert.</hi> The Mouth is almost Oval, each Corner ending in a small Channel. Both the Lips are turned outwards sideways, and as far as the end of the <hi>Turban.</hi> The Back is speckled with white, red, and blew. The <hi>Turban</hi> not high, nor hath more than three Rounds.</p>
                           <p>The PERSIAN WILK, with the Rounds of the <hi>Whirle</hi> plated and interrupted; so as the Plates of the several rounds do anticipate one another. Of these here are three.</p>
                           <p>The FLAT-LIP'D SNAIL. <hi>Cochlea sinistri Labri angulo duplici.</hi> Not described. In a manner half a long Oval. The left Lip is flat, whereby it hath a double edge. Deep within, 'tis stained with a shining Bay. The left Lip near the <hi>Turban</hi> almost an inch broad; before, it ends sharp. The <hi>Turban</hi> maketh but about two Rounds. Both this and the Body are beset with knobs in a spiral order, and are cover'd over with a pale purple Crust.</p>
                           <p>The short FLAT-LIP'D SNAIL. 'Tis white within; yet the left Lip is stained with two Bay spots. The Back of a light ash-colour. The Knobs of this have no Incrustation. The Rounds of the <hi>Turban</hi> are three.</p>
                           <p>The WRINKLED-SNAIL. <hi>Cochlea rugosa.</hi> Here are two of these, whereof one is near ½ a foot long. Each of the outer Rounds of the <hi>Turban</hi> is twice as big as the next within it. One of these is curiously figur'd by <hi>Besler.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The HOOK-NOS'D SNAIL. <hi>Cochlea Rostro recurvo.</hi> So
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:47321:71"/>
I call it, though it is not properly the Nose or Beak of the <hi>Snail,</hi> but of its shell. The <hi>Turban</hi> is pretty high. Both this and the Body are wrought with knobs and lines in an oblique and spiral Order.</p>
                           <p>The SNAIL with the SPIKED TURBAN. <hi>Cochlea Turbine aculeato.</hi> This shell is described and figur'd by <hi>Fabius Columna.</hi>

The Mouth is a kind of long Oval. The right Lip is spread, and as it were doubled outward. The Back faced with smooth Plates like so many more lips, carry'd ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely from the left Lip to the <hi>Turban,</hi> and there set with short but very sharp Spikes. The spaces betwixt these are ½ an inch broad, wrinkled with very small furrows, and curiously stained with pillars of white and brown lines meeting together in several Arches, as if it had been done by a <hi>Painter.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The SHORT-NOS'D SNAIL, with a low and plain or even <hi>Turban.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The DIPING-SNAIL, <hi>Cochlea Immerso Turbine.</hi> Not described. In other <hi>Snails</hi> the Rounds of the <hi>Whirle</hi> stand either in or else above a plain; here, they dip or run down within the shell. Here are divers of them; all very smooth, and of an Oval figure. One of a white colour, besprinkled with an innumerable company of small brown specks; about the bigness of a little <hi>Horse-Plum.</hi> The rest are smaller.</p>
                           <p>The LONG-MOUTH'D SNAIL. <hi>Cochlea Labris paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lelis, s. Cylindrovalis.</hi> The figure hereof is betwixt Cylin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drical and Oval. One half only of the left Lip is turned outward, and uneven with oblique furrows. The right Lip plain. The fore-angle of the Mouth crooked. The Rounds of the <hi>Turban</hi> furrow'd, not high, four or five in number. The Back is painted with a mixture of yellow, bay, blew and black specks. It is about two inches long. There are some more of the same <hi>Species</hi> that are less.</p>
                           <p>The NAVLE-SNAIL. <hi>Cochlea Umbilicalis.</hi> The <hi>Turban</hi> of this is smooth. The end of the inmost Round is produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced like a <hi>Navle,</hi> whence its Name.</p>
                           <p>Another sort of NAVLE-SNAIL. The <hi>Turban</hi> of this is set with short doubled or plated Spikes. It is almost a foot in length.</p>

The left uneven with three oblique furrows. The Back speckled with white and red. The <hi>Whirle</hi> hath four Rounds pretty high.</p>
                           <p>The PURPLE-WILK with solid Spikes. <hi>Purpura aculeis solidis.</hi> This and the other kinds commonly found in the <hi>Dead-Sea.</hi>

The main Body is not much bigger than a good big <hi>Nutmeg.</hi> But hath a Horn no less than two inches and ½ long, near the Mouth ¼ of an inch over, and sharp-pointed. Almost a Pipe, but a little open underneath by the length. Along the right Lip and the <hi>Turban</hi> it self, in three Rows, stand several long sharp plated or gutter'd Spikes triangu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly. But on the <hi>Turban</hi> they a little anticipate each other. As also do the Plates of the several Rounds. The right Lip is in some sort toothed, the left turned outward.</p>
                           <p>The PURPLE with REDOUBLED SPIKES, <hi>i. e.</hi> with the greater doubled Spikes collaterally subdivided into lesser. Of these there are four. Two of them white, described by <hi>Columna</hi> with the Name of <hi>Purpura sive Murex Pelagius marmoreus.</hi> Another, ash-colour'd; and a fourth, brown.</p>
                           <p>All <hi>Purples</hi> have a Canale or Gutter'd Horn long or short, in which is lodged that part which is called the <hi>Tongue;</hi> but performs the same Office as the Gills in other Fishes. <note n="b" place="margin">Fab.

                           <p>The SQUARE-WILK. <hi>Buccina Rhomboidea, i. e.</hi> It hath in a sort four equal sides, with unequal Angles. I find it not describ'd. The Mouth almost Oval, both the Corners a little gutter'd. The right Lip is first turned out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and then doubled or returned back again inward; and the edge a little toothed. Just opposite to this Lip, is laid upon the shell a kind of <hi>list,</hi> and doubled down in the same manner. Upon every Round of the <hi>Turban</hi> also are certain edged pieces in two opposite Rows. By these and the <hi>list</hi> above said the shell is made square.

                           <p>The Animal is of kin to the <hi>Polypus.</hi> Famous for the Art of Navigation. He rises to the top of the Water with his Shell inverted; and being there, returns it. Then having a thin Membrance spread against the Wind for a Sail, two Feet for the Rudder, and two for the Helm, he sails along. If any fear arises, he pulls all in, and filling his shell with Water, immediately sinks himself to the bottom of the Sea. <note n="a" place="margin">Arist. Hist. Anim. l. 9. c. 37. Scal. exercit.

                           <p>The PEARLY SAILER, 'Tis both within and without of the colour of the best Oriental Pearl. This sort is brought from <hi>India</hi> and the <hi>Persian</hi>-Gulf.

                           <p>The SPIKED SAILER. The Back and Belly of this are flat with two ridges, and on each ridge grows a row of short Spikes.</p>
                           <p>The MAILED SAILER. <hi>Nauticlus Laminatus.</hi> I meet with it no where. Both within, and especially without, of the colour of the richest Pearl. It is composed of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable number of Plates, as if in Armor. Yet the Plates continuous; furrow'd along the middle, and produced with a blunt Angle, almost like a Widows-Peak. From under each of which, emergeth a kind of little Tongue, like that of a <hi>Shoo-Buckle.</hi>

But if we observe, it is usual for people to have a high esteem of those things, even as to their Medicinal Virtue, that look prettily, or that are rarely to be had. Whereas, it is
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:47321:76"/>
plain, that Nature generally supplyeth us with the greatest plenty of those things, which are the most useful.</p>
                           <p>The round SEA-URCHIN or BUTTON-FISH. <hi>Echi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus orbicularis.</hi> Here are several <hi>Species</hi> hereof. The first I shall name is the <hi>Edible Button-Fish.</hi> These have very great Prickles, with <hi>Seats</hi> or <hi>Bases</hi> proportionable, in five double Orders. And the shells are orbicular. See the full Description in <hi>Rondeletius.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>They were anciently eaten raw before Supper, as <hi>Oysters</hi> are now, and as much esteemed.</p>
                           <p>The ROUND BUTTON-FISH, with ten Orders of midling Prickles. Of these Prickles it hath five Orders of bigger, and five of less, all Conical at each end, and bounded by ten more. Of this kind, here are some more, others less round. Some also that are <hi>White,</hi> and others <hi>Redish.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The ROUND BUTTON-FISH, with the least sort of Prickles, and disposed into ten Orders. Of this sort here are <hi>White, Brown,</hi> and <hi>Green.</hi> These, Mr. <hi>Lyster</hi> saith, are found in the <hi>English-Seas.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The GREAT OVAL SEA-UR CHIN. <hi>Echinometra Aristotelis.</hi> See the Description hereof in <hi>Calceolarius</hi>'s <hi>Musaeum.</hi> The greatest, and so as it were the Mother of all the other kinds; from whence its Name. This here is near ½ a foot long. Its Figure is not orbicular, but comes near an oval or flatish Heart.</p>
                           <p>The MARE-MAIDS-HEAD, or lesser Oval SEA-URCHIN. <hi>Echinus Spatagus.</hi> This differs from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, only or principally in being much less; seldom exceeding the bigness of a <hi>Hens Egg.</hi> These are shells rarely found.</p>
                           <p>The <hi>Sea-Urchin</hi> maketh its progressive motion with its Prickles which it useth instead of Feet. <note n="a" place="margin">Arist. H.

                           <p>The SEA-EAR. <hi>Auris marina.</hi> It hath its Name from its Figure, somewhat like a Mans ear. The inside is of a Pearl-colour, the outside brown and ruged with many small radiated and spiral wrinkles running across. There are several Holes on one side it, through which the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal admits and expels the water at pleasure. Here are three
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:47321:77"/>

                           <p>The VAULTED-LIMPET. <hi>Patella concamerata.</hi> No where described, that I know off. It seems to be of the <hi>Limpet</hi>-kind, or to stand betwix this and the <hi>Sea-Ear.</hi> It is in a manner a half Oval split by the length, which is an inch and half. It hath a <hi>Navle,</hi> as the <hi>Sea-Ear,</hi> winding to one side. The Back is rough, and of a whitish ash-colour. Within, very smooth and of a pale purpleish white. The hinder half is vaulted with a most white Plate, joyned to the sides ¼ of an inch below the edges.</p>
                           <p>The EVEN OVAL LIMPET. See the figure hereof in <hi>Johnston.</hi> That part which may be called the <hi>Navle,</hi> stands a little above the convexity of the shell.

                           <p>The PEARLY OVAL LIMPET. The inside hereof is of a curious pearl colour, with some rays of purple. It hath a greater convexity than the former, and is waved all round about.</p>
                           <p>The OVAL LIMPET, with very deep furrows round about. Whereby the edges also are very angular. The <hi>Seat</hi> of the Animal white. <hi>Columna</hi>

                           <p>NOte, That when I speak of the <hi>Base,</hi> I mean, that part on which the Teeth, Joynts or Hinges stand. When of the <hi>Navle,</hi> the peeked end of the shell, which for the most part stands behind the <hi>Base;</hi> as also that part which answers to it, where it doth not. When of the sides, not the Concave and Convex, but the edges produced from the <hi>Navle</hi> on the right and left.</p>
                           <p>The SEA-WING. <hi>Pinna.</hi> Each <hi>Valve</hi> is very like in shape to the Wing of a large Fowl, from whence I name it. Where broadest, near ¼ of a yard over. In length two feet: being the largest and longest of all the shells that I know. The two <hi>Valves</hi> are naturally ty'd together with a sort of <hi>Tow;</hi> whereby they are also fastened to some Stone or other Body under Water. The Animal is very good meat.</p>
                           <p>The SEA-OYSTER; in distinction from the common, which may be called the <hi>Shore-Oyster. Ostrea Pelagia.</hi> Here are several of this sort, all of them but small. <hi>Rondeletius</hi> saith, that in <hi>India</hi> they are sometimes a foot long.</p>
                           <p>The CHESTNUT-OYSTER. I meet with it no where described or figur'd. It is near two inches and ½ long, of an Oval Figure, and somewhat writhen. The outside is of a dark-brown, very uneven with large Oval Furrows. The
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:47321:78"/>
inside of a dark-Bay; from whence I name it. Held up against the light, it looks like a deep Tincture of <hi>Safforn</hi> or <hi>Myrrh.</hi> The <hi>Seat</hi> of the Animal is rough with small frizled or undulated Wrinkles, surrounded with a smooth Margin, on one side above ½ an inch broad, after an odd fashion turn'd or spread outward, Convex inward, and entirely encompassing the <hi>Navle</hi> of the shell. Here are three or four smaller Ones of the same <hi>Species.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>A SHELL with the <hi>Base</hi> a little cover'd. <hi>Ostrea Basi Cooper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta.</hi> I find it not described. It's somewhat doubtful whether a <hi>Limpet</hi> or an <hi>Oystershell.</hi> I think the latter. The <hi>Navle</hi> stands obliquely. But the sides make equal or similar lines from the <hi>Base.</hi> Somewhat above an inch in length, very Convex, the Margin oval. The <hi>Base</hi> is as it were shaded with a transverse Plate ⅛<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of an inch broad. The inside, blew; the outside speckled below with tawny and black spots, above with white and purple, with very small lines running across or Net-wise.</p>
                           <p>The PLAIN ROUND ESCALLOP. <hi>Pecten Valvis rotundis &amp; aequalibus.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The ROUND FURROW'D ESCALLOP, with smooth <hi>Shells</hi> or <hi>Valves.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Another of the same sort, with rough shells.</p>
                           <p>The LONG ESCALLOP. These and the other kinds seldom exceed the bigness of the palm of the Hand. But <hi>Linscholen</hi> 
                              <note n="a" place="margin">P. 90.</note> saith, That by <hi>Malacca</hi> are shells found like <hi>Scallops,</hi> so big, that two strong men can hardly draw one of them, with a leaver, after them. <hi>Scallops</hi> will move so strongly, as oftentimes to leap out of the <hi>Catcher</hi> wherein they are taken. <note n="b" place="margin">Arist.

                           </p>
                           <p>COKLE. <hi>Pectunculus.</hi> Here are of these, both White, Red, and speckled with various Colours.</p>
                           <p>The CORALLINE SCALLOP. <hi>Concha Corallina.</hi> I call it a <hi>Scallop,</hi> because it seems to be but another sort without ears. This is only waved. See <hi>Rondeletius</hi>'s De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription. He saith 'tis rarely found, and seldom, except
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:47321:78"/>
in the <hi>Dog-days,</hi> after long Southern Winds, cast on the shore.</p>
                           <p>The CORALLINE-SCALLOP both waved and wrink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; the Wrinkles and Waves standing not across, but the same way.</p>
                           <p>The long GAPING COCKLE. <hi>Chama.</hi> 'Tis thiner and more easily broken than most other shells. The <hi>Valves</hi> are seldom or never close shut. The sides are produced from the <hi>Base</hi> by similar lines, as in the <hi>Cockle,</hi> and the figure of the shell oblong: from whence I have taken leave for its Name. Whether the Anatomy of the Animal would suggest a better, I know not. This here is about an inch and ½ long; and of an ash-colour.</p>
                           <p>Of this, and probably all the other <hi>Species,</hi> it is omitted by those that describe them, that from each of the two Joynts at the <hi>Base,</hi> is produced a kind of bony <hi>Epiphysis,</hi> about ¼ of an inch long, thin, sharp and flexible: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon some of the muscular parts of the Animal seem to be fastened, for the restraining the opening of the shell from any inconvenient degree.</p>
                           <p>The BLACK GAPING COCKLE. This is somewhat lesser than the former, and of a rounder Figure, radiated, and the edges wav'd. As thin as the former, and hath the like <hi>Epiphyses.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>This sort, when the <hi>South-Wind</hi> blows, rise up to the top of the Water, and setting their two shells wide open; with the one under them, as a Boat; and the other, on one side as a Sail, they scoure along. <note n="a" place="margin">Bellon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> H.

'Tis near an inch long, and ¼ of an inch broad at the <hi>Base,</hi> where it is somewhat narrower than in the middle. Whitish, and with some Rays of blew. It consists of five greater pieces, whereof the middlemost pair, the greatest and the longest. The lesser pair are joyned to them edge to edge, reaching half their length, but not oppositely with their Points downward, as in the former <hi>Species,</hi> but upward. The fifth piece not joyned to this lesser pair, as in the other <hi>Species,</hi> but to the opposite edge of the greater. Round about the <hi>Base</hi> of the Shell several little pieces, some bigger and some less, stand after the manner of <hi>Scales,</hi> with their points also forward. So that it looks almost like a great <hi>Bud</hi> crushed flat. 'Tis joyned to a <hi>Neck</hi> about ¼ of an inch over; an inch, sometimes more, or less, in length; of a brown colour, rough, and composed of an innumerable company of small Knobs, almost like those on some Fishes Skins. Several Shells, by the like Necks, commonly grow all together in a Cluster.</p>

                           <p>THe Bigger HUMBLE-BEE. <hi>Bombylius major.</hi> First, With a broad-Belly, colour'd with Ashen, White, and Brown.</p>
                           <p>Another, with a Broad-Belly, Yellow and Citrine.</p>
                           <p>A Third, with a Long Tawny-Belly, and Brown Wings.</p>
                           <p>The Middle HUMBLE-BEE, with a Scarlet Breast, and Wings spoted with white and brown.</p>
                           <p>The Lesser HUMBLE-BEE, painted with Citrine and Iron-colour.</p>
                           <p>A WILD-BEE, with her Follicle or Bag, near the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of a <hi>Wrens-Egg.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Another sort of WILD-BEE, with their BAGS. They are about ½ an inch long, of a Cylindrical Figure, very thin and transparent, like the inner Coats of the Eye. Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly placed, for warmth and safety; <hi>sc.</hi> length-ways, one after another, in the middle of the <hi>Pith</hi> of an old <hi>Elder-Branch,</hi> with a thin boundary betwixt each Bag. The little <hi>Bees</hi> are somewhat thicker than the <hi>Flying-Ant;</hi> and their Bellies marked with four or five white Rings.</p>
                           <p>Another sort of WILD-BEE, which breeds in the stocks of old <hi>Willows.</hi> Curious to observe. They first bore a <hi>Canale</hi> in the Stock, which, for more warmth, they furnish afterwards with Hangings, made of <hi>Rose-Leaves,</hi> so rowled up, as to be contiguous round about to the sides of the <hi>Canale.</hi> And to finish their Work, divide the whole in to several Rooms or Nests, with round pieces of the same leaves. Hereof see in the <hi>Philos. Trans.</hi>

                           <p>Some parts of the NEST of another WILD-BEE. Not much unlike the first of those not inelegant figures, which <hi>Johnston</hi> gives under the Name of <hi>WESPEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STOCK.</hi>

                           <p>The under or hinder Wings of a <hi>Bee,</hi> are the least; that they may not incommode his flight. <note n="a" place="margin">Mouf. de Insect. cap. 1.</note> The Honey-Bag, is the Stomach, which they always fill to satisfie, and to spare; vomiting up the greater part of the Honey, to be kept against <hi>Winter.</hi> A curious Description and Figure of the <hi>Sting,</hi> see in Mr. <hi>Hook</hi>'s <hi>Micrography.</hi> In windy Weather, <hi>Bees</hi> often hold a little stone in their hinder Feet; which serves as a Ballast to make them sail through the Air more steadily. <note n="b" place="margin">Ibid.</note> The History of <hi>Bees,</hi> the best that <hi>Aristotle</hi> hath given us, <note n="c" place="margin">Hist.

                           <p>A WASPES-NEST. <hi>Vespetum.</hi> Given by Sir <hi>Jonas Moore,</hi> who received it from <hi>New-England.</hi> See the Figure of one in <hi>Johnston.</hi> 'Tis above a foot high, and near a foot over. Composed of a great number of little Cells, as in the <hi>Wild-Bees</hi> Nest, and encompassed with a Cover of the same <hi>stuff.</hi> All wrought about the Branch of a Tree.</p>
                           <p>Both this, and the <hi>Bees-Nest</hi> now mention'd, consist of the small <hi>Fibers</hi> of Plants, cohering, altogether as in <hi>Paper;</hi> as may be seen by a Glass. So that the <hi>Stuff</hi> may not be improperly called <hi>BEE-PAPER.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Another WASPES-NEST, like the former. Given by Dr. <hi>Thomas Allen.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>A LONG-OVAL FOLLICLE (perhaps of a sort of <hi>Hornet</hi>) with this peculiar, That the <hi>Silk</hi> is cover'd with a kind of brown Crust, marbled with blackish Veins.</p>
                           <p>A NESTED FOLLICLE, or one within another. Here are three of this sort, not fortuitous, but according to Nature. The utmost, is about an inch long, brown, and composed of Stiff-work, with a great many small <hi>Interstices:</hi> so that
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:47321:85"/>
it looks just like an Oval-Net. Within this, lies loose another much smaller, of a light Ash-colour, and made like other <hi>Insect-Bags.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The Polish'd FLESH-FLY; that which is of a blewish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>black, like <hi>Steel.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Another FLESH-FLY with a strong <hi>Proboscis</hi> or Trunk, tawny Wings, black Eyes, bunched Back, brown, long, and sharp Belly, forked Tail, Chesnut Feet, the hinder the longest.</p>
                           <p>The GOLDEN-EYE. <hi>Musca Chrysopis,</hi> as <hi>Moufet</hi> calls it. The Eye of this Fly is very curious, not only with its golden colour, but in being most elegantly latticed, like that of a <hi>Butterfly.</hi> Whilst alive, they have a very stinking scent.</p>
                           <p>The OX-FLY. <hi>Musca Boaria. Asilus.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The WHAME. <hi>Musca Apiformis. Tabani species.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The WASP-FLY. <hi>Tabani species altera.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The TWO-BRISTLED-FLY. <hi>Musca Bipilis.</hi> He hath two Bristles upon his Tail, standing level. <hi>Moufet</hi> describes five <hi>Species.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The THREE-BRISTLED-FLY. <hi>Tripilium.</hi> Of these <hi>Moufet</hi> also describes five sorts. Here are two of them; One greater, the other less. They are most in <hi>May</hi> and <hi>June</hi> before and after the Rains.</p>
                           <p>Flys, at the end of their <hi>Proboscis,</hi> have a <hi>Piercer</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they broach the Skin. <note n="a" place="margin">Mouf. de Ins. c. 10.</note> They go only, saith <hi>Moufet,</hi> with four Feet, using the two foremost instead of Hands. <note n="b" place="margin">Ibid.</note> This latter part of his Assertion is true; but the former, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to common Observation.</p>
                           <p>The Hair of the Head being often wet with the water of common Flys distill'd in <hi>Balneo Mariae,</hi> will grow to a very great length. <note n="c" place="margin">Id. c. 12.</note> Almost all Flys, being chew'd and swallow'd, cause violent vomitings. <note n="d" place="margin">Id. c. 12. <hi>out of</hi> Arnol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus.</note>
                           </p>
                           <p>Two FLY-NESTS; with some of the Flys. They are all black, with four Wings, the Horns and hinder Legs both long, and the end of the Tail thick. Of kin to the <hi>M. Bipilis.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The Nests are fasten'd or wrought, one, upon a head of <hi>Cypress-Grass;</hi> above ½ an inch long: the other, on the top of a Branch of <hi>Fern;</hi> and is about an inch long. Both oval, and white like Wooll; very porous and compressible,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:47321:85"/>
like a fine <hi>Sponge;</hi> and perforated with several little round Holes. Cuting one of them down the middle, I found, within, the more elaborate Work, consisting of a great number of little oval <hi>Cells,</hi> as in a <hi>Wild Bees-Nest.</hi> These <hi>Cells</hi> are placed in their length transversly to that of the Nest. In each of which, each <hi>Fly</hi> is bred a part from the rest.</p>
                           <p>The Great BUTTERFLY. <hi>Papilio major.</hi> This is of the second magnitude. The Wings are painted with citrine and black, both in long streaks and spots.</p>
                           <p>The Great PLUMED BUTTERFLY. The Wings are painted with black and scarlet Rings. In the place of Horns, he hath a pair of Plumes in his Forehead.</p>
                           <p>Another, with LONGER PLUMES. The Wings of this are spotted with black and tawny.</p>
                           <p>The lesser BUTTERFLY, with scarlet Wings; the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most of which are far shorter than the other.</p>
                           <p>Another, having the Wings speckled with red, yellow, brown and black spots.</p>
                           <p>Of the larger, middle, and lesser kinds, <hi>Moufet</hi> reckons up and describes five and thirty sorts. <note n="a" place="margin">Latter part of <hi>C.</hi> 14.</note>
                           </p>
                           <p>That which seems to be a Powder upon the Wings of a <hi>Butterfly,</hi> Is an innumerable company of extreme small Feathers, not to be discerned without a <hi>Microscope.</hi>

                           <p>The Great ADDERS Boult; from the strait long figure: <hi>Dragon-Fly,</hi> from the colour and bigness. <hi>Water-Butterfly,</hi> because they most frequent Rivers and watry places. <hi>Perla,</hi> from its colour. <hi>Libella,</hi> from its figure, when the Wings are spread out. In this, the <hi>Bases</hi> of the Wings are spoted, the Belly almost triangular, the Tail pointed, painted with black and gold-colour.</p>
                           <p>Another GREAT ONE, with silver Wings, a golden Mouth, a green Forehead, Chesnut Eyes, a round Belly painted with citrine and black.</p>
                           <p>A THIRD, with citrine Wings, a green Back, and a yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Belly. It is furnished both with Horns and Plumes in the Forehead.</p>
                           <p>The Middle ADDERS Boult. It is of a dark-Green.
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:47321:86"/>
The Head small, the Chest or middle part short, the Belly very long and slender. <hi>Moufet</hi> reckons up in all about 20 sorts.</p>
                           <p>The LANTHORN-FLY of <hi>Peru. Cucujus Peruvianus.</hi> A quite different <hi>Species</hi> from that described by <hi>Moufet.</hi> And, with respect to his Wings, is no way of kin to the <hi>Beetle</hi> or <hi>Scarabeus</hi>-kind, but rather the <hi>Locust.</hi> I find it no where described.</p>
                           <p>'Tis above three inches long, and thick as the <hi>Ring-finger.</hi> His Head, in bigness and figure, admirable; near an inch and half long, in the thickest part of it above half an inch over. From the Eyes forward it first swells or bellies out, afterwards contracts into a smaller, yet blunt end. 'Tis also crowned with a broad blunt knob, and the end resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated or bended upward. In its Circumference it hath seven low Ridges or Angles, marked with so many black lines, an eighth line being added betwixt the two upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most Angles. The greater part hereof (now) betwixt yellow and straw-colour. Yet stained with brown and red streaks and spots, neatly ranged, especially on the top and both sides. It seems, at least in the fore part, to be hollow, and almost like a Bladder blown up.</p>
                           <p>The Eyes, for the bigness of his Body, very small. Of a dusky-colour, yet glossy, and Sphaerical, looking just like two brown Seed-Pearls. Under these stand two small round parts, open at top, which seem to be the Roots of a pair of Horns: unless any will conceit them to be his Ears. Both these and the Eyes are guarded with a semilunar Ridge.</p>
                           <p>The other parts, being more or less spoil'd, cannot be perfectly describ'd. His <hi>Proboscis</hi> sufficiently strong, about ½ an inch long, and as thick as a stitching or <hi>Taylers</hi> Needle. The Feet all broken off.

He hath four Wings, almost like those of the <hi>Locust;</hi> the uppermost somewhat stronger and stiffer than the other. Both Pairs are of a dun-colour, sprinkled with dark-brown spots. They are extended considerably beyond the Body; yet the ends are worn off.</p>
                           <p>That which, beside the figure of the Head, is most
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:47321:86"/>
wonderful in this <hi>Insect</hi> is the shining property of the same Part, whereby it looks in the Night like a little Lanthorne (<hi>Lamphorne.</hi>) So that two or three of these fasten'd to a stick, or otherwise conveniently disposed off, will give sufficient light to those that travail or walk in the Night.</p>
                           <p>A BAULME KRICKET. <hi>Cicada.</hi> It is the fourth in order described by <hi>Moufet.</hi> The upper Wings of this <hi>Insect</hi> also are stiffer than the other, like those of the <hi>Locust.</hi> But that which is most remarkable, is the broad Hood which is spread over his Head and the top of his Shoulders. It is a Stranger here in <hi>England.</hi>

makes a noise like that of a <hi>Kricket.</hi> So great, saith <hi>Moufet,</hi> as to be heard above a mile off. <hi>Gryllotalpa:</hi> so called by the same Author, for that with his fore-feet, which are very strong and broad, and shaped like those of a <hi>Mole,</hi> he continually digs up, and makes himself Buries in the Earth. His hinder Feet are very long, wherewith he leaps; and by which, as well as by his <hi>Hood,</hi> he borders at least, upon the <hi>Grashopper</hi>-Kind. His <hi>Hood</hi> or <hi>Mantle,</hi> which <hi>Moufet</hi> I think omits, is about ½ an inch long; extended forward, over part of his Head; behind, over part of his Wings; before Concave, behind Convex.</p>
                           <p>His Eyes <hi>protuberant,</hi> yet not great (as <hi>Moufet</hi> would have them) but very small if compared with his Body: in colour, shape, and bigness like a <hi>Strawberry-seed.</hi>

                           <p>His Wings, saith the same Author, are longer than his Body. Whereby it appears, that he did not take notice, That this Animal hath four Wings, whereof the uppermost pair are not above ¾ of an inch long. The other indeed are prolonged above ¼ of an inch beyond the Tail. Each of these apart is most curiously foulded up inwards with a <hi>double Roll,</hi> so as to end in a point; having their middle Rib (as I may call it) which covers the two Rolls, flat and edged, and divided with transverse lines at right Angles. Their being thus folded up, is a contrivance to secure them from being torn, as he runs to and fro under ground.</p>

                              <note n="c" place="margin">Tab. 16. Fig. 2.</note> He hath three Horns. The first is only the Snout produced and bended upward, and is therefore moveable with the Head. In length, according to the figure in <hi>Olearius</hi> (for it is here broken off) about an inch and ½ forked at the end, and with one upper branch a little before the Eyes. The Head very little. Upon his Shoulders he hath two im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movable or unjoynted Horns, about ¾ of an inch long, ¼ of an inch over at the <hi>Base,</hi> directed forward, and with their points inward, like a <hi>Bulls-Horns.</hi> From the end of his Snout or fore-Horn to the end of his Tail he is about five inches long, over his Back above two and a ¼; the bigest of <hi>Insects</hi> yet known. His fore-Feet are armed with Spikes, as so many Claws; wherewith, 'tis likely he digs himself Buries. Of his Wings it is Observable, That at their utmost Joynt, they are laped up, or doubled inward towards the Head, and so kept safe under the Wing-Covers; being, when out at their full length, almost twice as long as the hinder Body or Section of the Animal. The like is observable of the Wings of some other <hi>Beetles.</hi> His Horns, Legs, Back and Wing-Covers are all black; his Belly brown.</p>

He hath but two Horns, yet those great ones. A Snout-Horn bended and toothed upward, and a Shoulder-Horn bended downward. From the end of which to the end of his Tail, about five inches. But he is not so broad as the <hi>Great Bull-Chafer.</hi>

Which also, so far as I have observ'd, is the principal Character of all the <hi>Carabus</hi>-kind, so far, as distinct from the <hi>Capricorne:</hi> whence I take leave for the <hi>English</hi> Name. His Horns rooted between the Eyes and the Snout; but they are here broken off. His Shoulder or Back-Piece almost square; yet edged with a Convex Margin on each side; above ¾ of an inch broad, and ½ an inch by the length of the <hi>Insect;</hi> burnish'd with two large spots of the colour of polish'd <hi>Bellmettle;</hi> betwixt which, and on the edges or margins of a shining-green.</p>

                           <p>On his Breast he hath a short, thick and sturdy <hi>Thorne</hi> or <hi>Spike</hi> directed forward, and somewhat downward. He is all over of a curious green, bright and with strong Rays of Gold, but mostly on his Belly, Forehead, and the inward Margins of his Wing-shells.

His Head small, somewhat bigger than that of a common <hi>Bee.</hi> His Eyes great, Oval, and of a <hi>Chesnut</hi> colour. His Forehead between them of a shining green, and rough cast. His Teeth very strong. His Horns broken off. His Shoulder-piece almost square, but somewhat broader behind. This, his Wing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shells, and his Breast of a glorious green mixed with some faint Rays of Gold; but their outer Margins, especially, as you turn him on his Belly, look of a pure <hi>Bice-Blew.</hi> Their hinder ends (as also the Tail) tinged with the

                           <p>The little GREEN CARABUS. About ½ an inch long. His Head small, scarce so big as of the common <hi>Black-Fly.</hi> His Snout oblong. His Eyes gogling, and of a <hi>Chestnut</hi> colour. His Neck also little. His Belly and Wing-shells much broader, especially behind, which is unusual.

                           <p>The Little BROWN CARABUS.

                           <p>The little TAIL'D-BEETLE. <hi>Scarabaeus caudatus minor.</hi> The Head and Shoulders are wanting. The Wing-shells almost two thirds of an inch long and ⅓ over. Of a dull ash-colour besprinkled with extream small blackish specks. His Legs and Belly of the same. He hath a strait, pointed Tail prolonged beyond the Wing-shells ⅙ of an inch, from whence I have nam'd him; and by which he seems of kin to the <hi>Hedge-Chafer.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The SHORT-SHELL'D BEETLE. By <hi>Aldrovandus,</hi> called <hi>Scarabaeus Serpentarius,</hi> somewhat absurdly, <hi>sc.</hi> for that he once found them in a <hi>Serpent.</hi> But his Description is not ill. He seems by the shortness of his Wing-shells to border on the <hi>Dorr</hi> or <hi>Hedge-Chafer,</hi> as the former. As also by their colour, composed of black and Chesnut Rings indented together. Here are five of this <hi>Species.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Another of the same <hi>Species,</hi> with the Wing-shells all over of a Chesnut colour. Described also by <hi>Aldrovandus.</hi> Of this sort here are several small ones.</p>

Of this, the Wing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shells are striated or furrow'd by the length. All the upper parts are black, the under parts blew, exactly like that colour which <hi>Watch-Makers</hi> and others give to their <hi>Steel-Works.</hi> Sometimes the nether parts are rather reddish, just like pure bright <hi>Copper.</hi> Sometimes their Tails and Belly of a golden Green, of which is that called by <hi>Wormius, Scarabaeus</hi>

                              <pb n="170" facs="tcp:47321:92"/>A THIRD, a kin to the former. Yet different from them, not only in being all over black, but especially in the make of his Feet. In those, hard and sharp with several little Prickles standing in a Row, with some stragling hairs. In this, having only two sharp Hooks or Claws at the end of his Feet, and his Feet soled with a treble <hi>Tuft</hi> of a close short tawny Down.</p>
                           <p>The SQUARE-SHELL BEETLE. The Head and Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of this are lost. The Wing-shells together, make almost a long square; being flat on the top, which is unusual, and the sides making right angles with their upper end. They are also striated or furrow'd by the length; and the sides curiously punched or pricked.</p>
                           <p>The BEETLE with pointed shells. The Head and Shoulders of this also are lost. All over of a very dark shining Bay. The Wing-shells above ½ an inch long, and of a peculiar figure; being not only much narrower, but also pointed behind.</p>
                           <p>The LONG-HEADED BEETLE. Here are several of them; all of a dun or blackish brown. But that whereby they differ from all other <hi>Beetles,</hi> is the shape of the Head, which, in proportion, is very long and slender.</p>
                           <p>The small PURPLE BEETLE. Of this sort here are two somewhat flat; and one thick and round.</p>
                           <p>The BLEW ROUND BEETLE. <hi>Viola.</hi> One as big as a <hi>Lady-Cow,</hi> but longer: the other near ½ an inch long; Both of a Violet colour.</p>
                           <p>The GREEN ROUND BEETLE, burnish'd with glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious golden Rays.</p>
                           <p>The Round Chesnut BEETLE, not without some Rays of Gold.</p>
                           <p>It may be worth the trial, Whether any of the <hi>Gilded</hi> sort of <hi>Beetles,</hi> are of the same Nature with <hi>Spanish Flys,</hi> or may produce the same effect, with less pain.</p>
                           <p>The SPIKED WATER-CLOCK. It seems to be that which <hi>Aldrovandus</hi> describes (but very imperfectly) under the Name of <hi>Scarabaeus Aquaticus.</hi> 'Tis about two inches long, and ¼ over where broadest. All over of a shining black: excepting, that his Eyes are brown; his <hi>Antennae,</hi> tawny, his fore-Belly overlaid with a kind of <hi>Lemon colour'd Velvet.</hi> On his Back, there is a triangular piece indented
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:47321:92"/>
between the Wing-shells. The Legs are much broken, on the third Joynts, at least of four of them, grow a pair of black sharp Prickles about the length and thickness of the sting of a <hi>Bee.</hi> But that which is most remarkable, is a strong and sharp <hi>Spike</hi> or <hi>Needle</hi> which stands horizon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally on his fore-Belly, and with its point towards the Tail. His Wing-shells are carry'd down considerably below his Belly: so that being turned on his Back, he looks as if he lay in a Boat.</p>
                           <p>By the shape of the Wing-shells, this <hi>Insect</hi> seems, like the <hi>Notonecta</hi> (whereof presently) to swim on his Back. In which posture, in case of an approaching enemy, the aforesaid <hi>Needle</hi> is also ready for his defence.</p>

Kind, but scarce describes them. All the <hi>Species</hi> agree, in having a very small Head, broad Shoulders, a Pyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midal Back-piece, and the upper Wings somewhat like as in the <hi>Boat-Fly, sc.</hi> half Crustaceous and half Membranous. This, is almost ¼ of an inch long, near ½ an inch broad. His Shoulder and Back-Pieces yellow, shining and rough cast. The fore half or crusty part of the upper Wings of a russet, the Membranous of a sad green. The Belly straw colour'd and Chesnut, and divided into several Sections with black Lines, half of them meeting at the ridge of the Belly.</p>
                           <p>The SPIKED PUNEE. In proportion longer and nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower than the former. The Back russet, brown and black. The Belly, ashen. Where, that which is most observable, is a short, flat, and very sharp <hi>Thorne</hi> or <hi>Spike</hi> standing level, as in the <hi>Spiked Water-Clock,</hi> but with the point the quite contrary way, <hi>sc.</hi> towards the Head.</p>
                           <p>The HIGH-SHOULDER'D PUNEE. He is otherwise of the shape and bigness of the former: all over of a brown or dun colour, especially the Membranous parts of his Wings.</p>
                           <p>The SQUARE-WINGED PUNEE. Scarce ¼ of an inch long, and almost as broad. Partly colour'd with a shining black, and three spots of white on each side.</p>
                           <p>Another Square PUNEE, with the Crustaceous part of the Wings russet.</p>
                           <p>The SHORT-WING'D PUNEE. In which respect chiefly, it differs from the former; the Wings being in those prolonged to the end of the Tail; here, but half way.</p>
                           <p>The LONG-PECKLED PUNEE. This kind, <hi>Moufet</hi> hath pictur'd among the small <hi>Beetles;</hi> but by a mistake, it being really a sort of <hi>Flying Punee,</hi> with Wings partly Crustaceous and party Membranous, which is their Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteristick. The Shoulder-piece, Back-piece, Sides, Belly, and crusty part of the Wings, are all red bespeckled with black spots; the Membranous part, dun and speckled with white.</p>

It is usually found adhering to a kind of <hi>Asellus</hi> or <hi>Cod-Fish</hi> in the <hi>Island-Sea,</hi> to which it is very troublesome. This account together with the <hi>Insect</hi> it self were sent hither by Mr. <hi>Olaus Borrichius.</hi> Not disagreeing from <hi>That</hi> which is described in some sort by <hi>Wormius,</hi> by the same Name: nor from <hi>That</hi> in <hi>Piso,</hi> called by the <hi>Americans, Acarapitamba.</hi> Yet I find not the Figure any where to answer to the Animal; the entire length where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, is about two inches and ½. The fore part Oval: whence it narrows all the way to the Tail. Where broadest above ¾ of an inch. Its shelly Armor consisteth of about twenty Plates, of a straw colour: The Legs on each side in number answerable. The Eyes are most curiously latticed with cross lines, so as to divide them into an infinite number of <hi>Rhombs.</hi> He seemeth to have notable sharp Chisell-Teeth, whereby partly he becomes so troublesome to his Bearer. The other parts are lost.</p>

So that it seems to be made by the casual eruption of several sturdy Buds together, which having begun the draught of the Sap, it still continu'd to swell the Knot, after they were faln off. And it is probable, that Animal-Wens are then produced, when two or three sprigs of a Nerve bigger or more than ordinary, shooting into a part of a Muscle, do thereby more invigorate it, and so make it capable of a more copious nourishment.</p>

                           <p>The Fruit grows in <hi>Jamaica, Barbados,</hi> and other parts of the <hi>West-Indies.</hi> Of the flesh or pulp whereof, they there make very good Conserves.</p>
                           <p>A NETTED-STONE. Described by <hi>Bauhinus</hi> 
                              <note n="b" place="margin">Tom. 1. p. 328.</note> with the Title of <hi>Fructus reticulato corio:</hi> mistaking it for a <hi>Nut.</hi> The greater part of the Stone is of the same substance with that of other Plum-stones. But over this is spread a netted Work of larg woody <hi>Fibers.</hi> It was brought from <hi>Guiney;</hi> but it grows also in <hi>Virginia.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Another WOODY STONE. A very great one; but ratably short, <hi>sc.</hi> two inches long, and two and ½ over, like a midling <hi>Pippin.</hi> Very little stony, but all its outer part, at least, perfectly woody, or made up of a multitude of woody <hi>Fibers.</hi> The largest whereof are prolonged from the <hi>Base</hi> to the <hi>Cone,</hi> associated all along by lesser ones run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning betwixt them.</p>
                           <p>A Third WOODY STONE. Almost of the shape and bigness of a <hi>Pigeons-Egg.</hi> But a little compressed. 'Tis
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:47321:102"/>
cover'd all over with Liguous <hi>Fibers,</hi> so extream closely woven together, that it looks as if it were all Wood. Some of the greater run directly from the Stalk to the Flower or top. So great a difference there is betwixt these <hi>Indians</hi> Stones, and those of our <hi>Europaean</hi> Fruits, which have very few, and most not above two or three on the outside.</p>
                           <p>The STONE of the <hi>Brasilian</hi> Fruit called <hi>AND A. Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mius</hi> hath given hereof but a bad Figure: but describes it better. Yet with a mistaken Title, as if it were the entire Fruit. 'Tis a very hard and great Stone, as big as a mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling <hi>Bell-Peare,</hi> but a little compressed: broad at the Base, and sharp pointed, with some resemblance to a Heart. The sides of the Shell of a wonderful thickness. Penetrated to the Kernel with three great holes.</p>
                           <p>Amongst many observable Instances of the Contrivances Nature makes for the growth of the Seed, in whatsoever Cover <note n="a" place="margin">See the Authors Book <hi>Of Plants,</hi> c. 1. &amp; ult.</note> it be included; this Stone is one. For being so extraordinary hard and thick; it were impossible the Kernel within it (which is also great) should be supplyed with <hi>Aer</hi> and <hi>Sap</hi> sufficient for its growth; were not those three great holes made on purpose, for a plentiful admission of both.</p>
                           <p>And as great an instance it is of the seemingly wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful force of the <hi>Radicle,</hi> or that small and tender part of the Kernel, which becomes the Root of the Plant; by which, chiefly, the sides of the Stone, those thick Walls, are made to cleave asunder to make way for its descent into the ground. But <hi>Time</hi> seems to do the same thing here, as <hi>Celerity</hi> doth in the <hi>Statera;</hi> where a small Weight set at a greater distance from the Centre of gravity, will ballance a big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger that's nearer: because, what it wants in <hi>bigness,</hi> is made up by the <hi>Celerity</hi> of its motion. So the <hi>Radicle</hi> of a Ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, having though a slow motion, yet some, and that continu'd, it is able in time to master a sturdy Body which hath no contrary motion at all, but is at rest.</p>
                           <p>One or two of the Kernels, which are as big as <hi>Dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scene-Plums,</hi> both Purge, and sometimes Vomit. If taken raw, they work roughly: but boyl'd and preserv'd with Sugar, may be given to Children. <note n="b" place="margin">Piso.</note>

near two inches. On one side, very Convex; on the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite, almost flat. The Base Oval; the top, presently sharpen'd into a point. Of a russet colour, very hard, ruged, and having broad Furrows, most of them running by the length; out of some of which arise several woody <hi>Fibers.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Another like STONE. 'Tis as big as a <hi>Pullets</hi> Egg. On one side more Convex, as the former. Of a russet colour, hard and granulated. All over uneven with many, though not very deep Furrows, divers whereof are produced from the <hi>Base</hi> almost to the <hi>Cone.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The said Furrows, both in this and all the other Stones, are to be understood the Seats of woody <hi>Fibers,</hi> wherewith they were originally fill'd up.</p>

                           <p>THe Great OVAL CALIBASH. In length, almost ¼ of a foot; above a foot and ½ in compass. Its Figure answerable to that of a <hi>Hens-Egg,</hi> one end, <hi>sc.</hi> the top, being somewhat smaller than the other. 'Tis now of a kind of tawny colour, or like that of an old <hi>Pomgranate-Pill.</hi> About as hard as a <hi>Wallnut,</hi> and the shell somewhat thicker. Originally fill'd (as may be seen by some of them) with a Pulp and a great number of Seeds, as is a <hi>Melon</hi> or <hi>Gourd.</hi> Yet a <hi>Calibash</hi> is the Fruit of a Tree. In some sort described by <hi>Ligon.</hi>

                           <p>The Middle OVAL CALIBASH. Of the same tawny colour, as the former; as also a little slenderer at the top, than the bottom. In length four inches and ¼, and 3 and ½ broad; of the bigness of a <hi>China Limon.</hi> It hath a little round knob at the top, as big as a <hi>Great Pins Head.</hi> The Seed, almost of the colour, size and shape of an <hi>Apple-Kernel;</hi> saving that the top is shaped like the common Picture of a Heart.</p>
                           <p>The little OVAL CALIBASH. Of a like colour with the former, but stained with some black Spots. Three inches and ½ long; two and ¼ over; somewhat bigger than a <hi>Turkeys-Egg.</hi> Of a perfect Oval, that is, with both the ends cut by the same <hi>Ellipsis,</hi> yet both a very little prominent. And the top apiculated, as in the former. It seems a kin to the <hi>Cucurbita Indica minor Taberna Montani;</hi> and that the said Author mistook a <hi>Calibash,</hi> for a <hi>Gourd.</hi>

Figur'd after a manner by <hi>Bauhinus</hi> with the mistaken Title of <hi>Cucurbita Indica Lagenaria:</hi> it being not a <hi>Gourd,</hi> but the Fruit of a Tree, as is abovesaid.

                           <p>The little FLAGON or BOTTLE CALIBASH. About four inches and ½ long. The Belly, three inches over. The Head, an inch and ¾. The Neck, a little above an inch. The Shell, at the top of the Head above ¼ of an inch thick.</p>
                           <p>The PEAR-CALIBASH. In length about five inches, the Neck somewhat long and slender, the Belly two inches and ½ over: so as both in figure and bigness to resemble the <hi>Pear</hi> figur'd by <hi>Bauhinus</hi> with the Name of <hi>Pirum Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulatorium.</hi> On one side, colour'd with a light, on the other with a deeper yellow.</p>
                           <p>A Double PEAR-CALIBASH.</p>
                           <p>A TRIANGULAR CALIBASH. 'Tis smooth, and black, shaped like the <hi>Egyptian Cucumer,</hi> called <hi>Chate.</hi> About five inches long. The Neck triangular; whether naturally, uncertain. From thence belly'd like a <hi>Pear;</hi> two inches and ½ over. The shell very hard, and as thick as of the <hi>Flagon-Calibash.</hi>

The Natives sometimes line their insides with some kind of <hi>Rosin</hi> (as we rosin Wooden-Cans) the better to preserve the Liquor they put into them; which, if spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, would otherwise either drench through, or loose of its strength. Whether the Rosin they use, be such as gives no ill tast to the Liquor may be a query.</p>
                           <p>The BAOBAB. <hi>Abavi Clusij.</hi> Of affinity with the Fruit by <hi>Scaliger</hi> called <hi>Guanabanus. Wormius,</hi> I think mistakingly, makes it the same. 'Tis well described and figur'd by <hi>Bauhinus.</hi> 
                              <note n="a" place="margin">Lib. 1. c. 42.</note> This is of the bigness of a mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling <hi>Pomecitrine,</hi> and of answerable shape.

                              <pb n="195" facs="tcp:47321:104"/>
When fresh gather'd, 'tis fill'd with a soft Pulp, and as it should seem, much more juycy, than in the <hi>Calibash.</hi> With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Pulp is contained a great number of Seeds, or little Stones, of the bigness, and with somewhat of the shape, of <hi>Indian</hi> Wheat. <hi>Besler</hi> hath a good Figure hereof, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting it cut open, to shew the Seeds.</p>
                           <p>The GREAT LONG BAOBAB. I meet with no Descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion answering to this <hi>Species.</hi> 'Tis in length ten inches, a foot in compass, being ratably much slenderer than the former, and almost Cylindrical. The upper end, made a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle slenderer; the top of all, flat, and an inch and ¼ over.</p>
                           <p>The GREAT BELLY'D-BAOBAB. Much bigger than the former, and no where describ'd, that I find. In length, an inch above a foot; and above a foot and ½ in compass. Towards the upper end, belly'd. But the end it self pointed almost like a <hi>Limon.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The <hi>Baobab</hi> grows in the Island <hi>Zeilan,</hi> and in <hi>Aegypt.</hi> The Juyce hereof is of an acidulated Tast, very grateful: of which the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> make much use, especially when they travail, to quench their thirst.</p>
                           <p>The MACOCQUER. A <hi>Virginian</hi> Fruit, described by <note n="a" place="margin">Tom. 1. 254.</note> 
                              <hi>Bauhinus.</hi> It seems to be of affinity with the <hi>Calibash,</hi> or perhaps a small <hi>Species</hi> thereof. It is of an Orbicular-Figure, and of the bigness of a little Hand-Ball. Though <hi>Clusius</hi> affirmeth <note n="b" place="margin">Exot. l. 11. c. 11.</note> it to be sometimes four inches in Diametre. The shell is thin and brittle.

                           <p>The Natives, having empty'd the shells of the Pulp and Seeds, and in the room hereof, put in some little Stones, use them as <hi>Rattles,</hi> wherewith to rejoyce upon any special Occasion.</p>
                           <p>The GENIPAT, <hi>Junipap,</hi> or <hi>Junipappeeywa.</hi> A <hi>Brasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> Fruit so called. Described by <hi>Bauhinus.</hi>

                           <p>The Natives use this Fruit against <hi>Diarrhae'as.</hi> As also to paint themselves. They chew the Pulp, and then
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:47321:105"/>
squeezing the Juyce out, rub it upon their Body: as it drys, it turns to a blackish blew. This they do, when they visit a Friend, or upon any solemn Occasion, would be fine.</p>

                           <p>The COCO-NUT. The Fruit of a very tall Tree, both in the <hi>East</hi> and <hi>West-Indies,</hi> growing only upon the top of it.

With three sides, one whereof more flat; bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly'd in the middle, and somewhat Conick at both ends; so that it is a kind of Sphaerical Triangle. The Husk or outmost part of the Nut on the sides, about an inch thick; at the Corners, an inch and ½; almost wholly consisting of tough woody <hi>Fibers;</hi> so that being cut <hi>transversly,</hi> it looks like a stiff <hi>Scrubbing-Brush.</hi> Next within this <hi>Fibrous</hi> Part, lies the Shell, brown, hard, and brittle, like a <hi>Plum-Stone;</hi> the 1/<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                           <p>The COCO is one of the most useful Trees in the World. Of the Husk or outmost fibrous Cover of the Nut, all manner of Ropes and Cables are made throughout <hi>India.</hi> Of the Shells, the <hi>Indians</hi> make Ladles, Wine-Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, and many sorts of Vessels. The inmost Cover next the <hi>Kernel,</hi> while it contains only Liquor, they eat with salt, as a very pleasant meat. The said Liquor, is commonly used, as a clear sweet and cool Drink. Sometimes they cut away the Blossom of the young <hi>Nut,</hi> and binding a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Vessel to the place, thereby obtain a sweet and pleasant Liquor, which they call <hi>Sura.</hi> This standing an hour in the Sun, becomes good <hi>Vinegar,</hi> used throughout <hi>India.</hi> The same Distill'd (I suppose after fermentation) yieldeth a pretty strong <hi>Brandy,</hi> called <hi>Fulo,</hi> and is the first running. The second, is called <hi>Uraca,</hi> the only <hi>Wine</hi> of <hi>India.</hi> Of the same <hi>Sura,</hi> being boil'd, and set in the Sun, they also make a sort of brown Sugar, which they call <hi>Jagra.</hi>

From the <hi>Kernel</hi> it self, when fresh, and well stamped, they press out a Milk, which they always mix and eat with their <hi>Rice-Meats.</hi> Of the <hi>Kernel</hi> dry'd (called <hi>Copra</hi>) and stamped, they make Oil, both to eat, and to burn. Of the Leaves of the Tree (called <hi>Olas</hi>) they make the Sails of their Ships: as also Covers for their Houses and Tents; and Summer-Hats. Of the Wood, they make Ships without Nails; sewing the several parts together with the Cords made of the Husk of the <hi>Nut.</hi>

                           <p>But that which is most observable, and whereof no Author takes notice either in the Description or Figure of this Fruit, is this, That the Scales which compose the Shell, are not so set together, as to have their open ends or points upwards, as in a <hi>Cone:</hi> but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, so as to have their roots uppermost, and their open and outmost ends or points downwards, or towards the Base of the Shell, as of the Slates upon a House towards the ground.

                           <p>This Fruit is, by <hi>Celaspine,</hi> most absurdly called <hi>Fungus Orientalis.</hi> And <hi>Wormius</hi>

                           <p>I find, that <hi>Cordus</hi> goeth thus far, as to observe, That within this <hi>Nut</hi> is contained a Rudiment of the future Plant, consisting as it were of two little pretty veined Leaves, and a Stalk. But that these Leaves were the two <hi>Lobes</hi> or main Body of the Seed, that the Stalk of these Leaves, as he calls it, was the Root, and that between these Leaves was cooped the Bud, of the future Plant, are things whereof he had not the least notion. Neither did he know (for he speaks of it as a peculiar) that the like conspicuous foliation, is, as in truth it is, observable in the seeds of a great many other Plants.</p>
                           <p>Half a Drachm of this Nut, given to a Dog, in powder, hath kill'd him, saith <hi>Bauhinus,</hi> in four hours. About <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>j, hath put a Dog into so great Convulsions, that he hath dy'd in less than half an hour.</p>
                           <p>The true VOMITING-NUT. <hi>Nux Methel Officinarum.</hi> So that by a mistake, the Names of the <hi>Nut</hi> before describ'd,

The lesser <hi>Juniper-Berrys</hi> (and probably these) are of good and various use in Medicine, if they are fresh. One of the best ways of using them, is by extract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a deep and strong body'd Tincture of them with Spirit of Wine, whereof a spoonful, or more or less, to be taken in Wine or other convenient Vehicle.</p>

Not much differing from the Round, saving in the Spike. It grows in <hi>Malabar, Java,</hi> and <hi>Sumatra;</hi> but especially in <hi>Bengala,</hi> where it is called <hi>Pimpilim.</hi> See <hi>Piso</hi> hereof. <note n="a" place="margin">Mantissae Aromat. c. 8.</note>

Here, upon one Stalk, hang about 15 Cods, most of them three inches long, thick as a <hi>Goose-Quill,</hi> fibrous, and of the colour of Cloves; containing ten or twelve blackish and longish Seeds, each in a Cell by it self; not half so big as the least of <hi>French-Beans,</hi> which <hi>Bauhinus</hi> affirmeth them to equal, but more like the Seed of the <hi>Laburnum majus.</hi> Neither, according to the same Author, hath it the tast of <hi>black Pepper,</hi> but rather of the <hi>Clove; viz.</hi> not much biting, yet very <hi>Aromatick,</hi> especially being well heated at a fire.</p>
                           <p>POYSON-BERRYS. So they are inscrib'd.

                           <p>The COD of a <hi>West-Indian</hi> Plant, called TAXOCO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>QUAMOCHIT. This Cod, but not the Plant, is described and figur'd in <hi>Bauhinus.</hi>

                           <p>The COD of a KIDNEY-BEAN of <hi>Brasile.</hi>

                           <p>The COD of another <hi>Brasilian</hi> KIDNEY-BEAN, with the Beans enclosed. It differs from the former in being black, and in the number of its Cells, which are three. The Bean is somewhat Oval, and wrinkled, and having a Seat which reaches almost its whole compass. See a good Figure hereof in <hi>Calceolarius</hi>'s <hi>Musaeum.</hi>

                           <p>HERCULES'S CLUB. <hi>Rubi facie senticosa Planta.</hi> A tall woody Plant, described in some sort, and so called, by <hi>Lobelius.</hi> Near three yards long; how much longer, is uncertain, being cut off at both ends; almost seven inches in compass, strait, and but very little taper'd. Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally, had two or three Branches, here cut off. En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compassed with a great many pointed Studs, (whence its Name) thick set, and sometimes growing double, flatish, and about an inch broad by the length of the <hi>Club,</hi> after the figure of the Thorns of the <hi>Rasberry-Bush.</hi> Like to which they are also meerly cortical, having not one fiber of wood in them, whereby they break like <hi>Cork,</hi> but are not so soft.

                           <p>Several SPIKES or Heads of MAYZ or <hi>Indian</hi>-Wheat; with the Grains, as is not unusual, of three or four colours. The Description of the Plant, with a large Account of its Culture, and Use, were communicated by Mr. <hi>Winthrop</hi> sometime since Governour of <hi>Connecticut</hi> in <hi>New England:</hi> and by me lately published, in a succinct but full Relation, <note n="b" place="margin">Phil. <hi>Trans. N.</hi> 142</note> with some alteration of the Method. The Plant grows to the height of six or eight feet; and is joynted like a Cane. 'Tis also full of a sweet juyce like that of the Sugar-Cane. On the Spike grow several strong thick Husks, which, before it is ripe, shut it close up round about. Thereby defending it, not only from all Weathers, but also the Ravine of Birds, to which, the Corn, while tender, is a sweet and enticing food.</p>
                           <p>The Stalks of this Corn, are good Fodder for Cattel. As are also the Husks about the Spike. The <hi>Indian</hi> Women slit the Husks, and weave them into Baskets of several fashions. Of the Juyce above-said may be made a Syrup as sweet as Sugar: which probably, may also be made of it, by the usual method. The <hi>Indians</hi> eat the ripe Corn either boil'd; or more usually parched; of it self, or, as Bread, with Flesh. The green Corn also, which, as is said, hath a sweet Tast, being boil'd, dry'd, and kept in Bags, and when they eat it, boil'd again, they account a principal Dish. The <hi>English,</hi> of the ripe Corn, make very good Bread: but it must be mixed nothing near so stiff as our Wheat-Meal. But the best sort of Food made hereof; they call <hi>Samp.</hi> Having water'd, and ground it to the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Rice, and winnow'd or sisted the Hulls from it, they boil it tender, and so with Milk, or with Butyr and Sugar, make it a very pleasant Dish. 'Twas often prescribed by Dr. <hi>Wilson</hi> to his Patients here in <hi>London.</hi> The <hi>Indians</hi> that live much upon it, seldom troubled with the <hi>Stone.</hi> The <hi>English</hi> also make very good <hi>Beer,</hi> both of the <hi>Bread,</hi> and of the <hi>Malt,</hi> made of this Corn. But it will not make good <hi>Malt</hi> the ordinary way, because, not without sprouting
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:47321:118"/>
both ways to a considerable length: whereby it is so matted before it is fully malted, that it cannot be opened without breaking the <hi>Come.</hi> To avoid which, they pare off a Turff about three inches thick, and laying the Corn all over the bare ground, cover it with the Turff, till the Plot looks like a green Field, at which time, the Corn is well malted. Then taking it up in matted pieces, they dry it on a Kiln, or in the Sun.</p>

                           <p>The principal knack, without which all their labour were in vain, is in making the Juyce, when sufficiently boil'd, to <hi>kerne</hi> or <hi>granulate.</hi> Which is done, by adding to it, a small proportion of <hi>Lye</hi> made with (vegetable) <hi>Ashes:</hi> without which, it would never come to any thing by boiling, but a Syrup, or an Extract.

                           <p>In refining the Sugar, the first degree of pureness, is effected only by permitting the <hi>Molosses</hi> to drain away through a hole at the bottom of the <hi>Sugar-Pots;</hi> the <hi>Pots</hi> being, all the time, open at the top. The second degree is procur'd, by covering the <hi>Pots</hi> at the top with <hi>Clay.</hi> The reason whereof is, for that the <hi>Aer</hi> is hereby kept out from the <hi>Sugar,</hi> which, in the open <hi>Pots,</hi> it hardens, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it hath full time to refine by separation.

                           <p>This here (as it is often) is a double Root; each of them round, and somewhat flat. The uppermost like the dry'd Root of <hi>Arum,</hi> white and friable; but the Tast is extinct. Full and frim, in breadth or <hi>transversly,</hi> two inches; encompassed with three or four very small Circles, whereupon several Leaves did once grow: underneath, are the portions of several small dead Stalks; on the top and sides, the Buds of others to come. To this, by a short Neck between, hangs the lower; which being also the elder, is more fuzzy and shrunk up.</p>
                           <p>This Description cannot be understood, without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that, which is very observable of this, and a great number of other <hi>Plants;</hi> and whereunto, no one <hi>Botanick</hi> hath adverted: <hi>viz.</hi> That the Root is annually repaired, or renewed out of the Stalk it self. Particularly, of this <hi>Plant,</hi> that one of its two Roots doth every year perish, the other is new made; not out of the other Root before it perishes, but out of the Stalk it self. The Stalk descending by such degrees, as that part thereof which, the last year, was the lowermost above ground; this year, being sunk (or rather by the appendent strings pulled) under ground, becomes the upper Root; the next year, the under Root; and the year after, rots off; another new Root being still yearly made out of the Stalk. By which way, and not as Trees by the same numerical Root, this and other like <hi>Plants</hi> are perennial.</p>
                           <p>This Root, the <hi>Egyptians</hi> eat very greedily, both raw, boil'd, and all manner of ways; supposing them, <hi>praevalidè excitare venerem.</hi> The Roots of the common <hi>Arum</hi> boil'd, were heretofore eaten among the <hi>Greeks:</hi> and may tast as well as boil'd <hi>Onions.</hi>

                        <p>A Great FISTULAR MUSHROON. So I call it. Given by Sir <hi>Rob. Southwell.</hi> I find no Description of this <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</hi> They commonly grow upon the <hi>Elm.</hi> This is ½ a <hi>Cone,</hi> as having grown to the side of the Tree without stalk. The Diametre of the <hi>Base,</hi> near ½ a yard; from whence it rises above ¼ of a yard in height, narrowing all the way to the top. Girded with several Rings of various breadth. Outwardly, very hard and dense. Inwardly soft and compressable, like a <hi>Pith,</hi> and is in substance really such. Consisting of an innumerable company of small soft <hi>Fibers,</hi> wrought together almost as pure fine Wooll in a Hat. The bottom is all over perforated with <hi>Pores;</hi> of the bigness of those little <hi>Foveae</hi> in the seeds of <hi>Poppy;</hi> and are the extremities of as many small strait and parallel Pipes of a considerable length, probably, almost through to the top, as I have seen them in a lesser of the same kind. These <hi>Pores</hi> or <hi>Pipes</hi> may be distinctly seen without a Glass. With one, a <hi>Slice</hi> of the <hi>Mushroon</hi> looks like a piece of wood out of which <hi>Button-Moulds</hi> have been turn'd. Both the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the <hi>Pipes,</hi> and of the other parts of the <hi>Mushroon,</hi> so far as visible, is answerable only to the <hi>Cortical,</hi> or pithy Part of a Plant. So that it seems to be but half of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Plant: or wanting the Lignous Part, by which all Plants receive their various Figures, is a kind of Vegetable <hi>Mola;</hi> in comparison, a rude mishapen thing.</p>

<pb n="240" facs="tcp:47321:127"/>
the most part of it, is a heap of small red Mites. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth also, as is probable, one or more <hi>Maggots,</hi> which feed upon the <hi>Mites.</hi>

                        <p>The said Juyce or Pulp (as it is called) is made use of for the Confection of <hi>Alkermes,</hi> and other purposes. For the <hi>Deyers</hi> use, the <hi>Berrys</hi> are spread abroad upon Linnen, and to prevent heating, turned twice a day. When the <hi>Mites</hi> creep out and cover the <hi>Berrys,</hi> they are sprinkled with <hi>Vinegar,</hi> and rub'd a little, and so separated by a <hi>Searce;</hi> repeating, till the <hi>Berrys</hi> yield no more. Of this Pulp, Powder, or Heap of <hi>Mites,</hi> are formed little <hi>Balls,</hi> and so exposed to the Sun to dry. The use of the <hi>Vinegar,</hi> is to kill or weaken the <hi>Mites</hi> and <hi>Maggots,</hi> which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise would turn to little <hi>Flys</hi> (rather <hi>Bees.</hi>) The empty <hi>Husks,</hi> being washed with <hi>Wine</hi> and dry'd, are put up in <hi>Sacks,</hi> either alone, or with a quantity of powder in the middle.

                        <p>To the <hi>Remarques</hi> above mention'd, I shall add one more, which is, That as the Pulp or Powder, so called, is a Cluster of small Animals: so the Husk it self is an Animal Body, as it were grafted on the Stock or Leaf, whereon it grows; and so converteth all the nourishment it deriveth thence (as <hi>Bread</hi> eaten is turned to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        <p>The principal difference which I note betwixt the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign and these <hi>English Berrys,</hi> now dry, is, That in those, the powder is red, and more bitter, in these white, and less bitter. But whether the powder in these also was not once red, I cannot say. For in some even of the Forreign <hi>Berrys,</hi> I find it white.

Further, I find no certain account. To me, thus much seems evident, That 'tis neither a Vegetable Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scence, as some surmise; nor an <hi>Insect,</hi> as others: yet an Animal Body, as the <hi>Kermes Berry,</hi> by some <hi>Insect</hi> affixed to a Plant; and thence nourished for a time, but ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd before it be fill'd with <hi>Mites</hi> or <hi>Maggots.</hi> For being held, as the <hi>Kermes Berry,</hi> in the flame of a <hi>Candle;</hi> it usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally huffs and swells, but always stinks, like Hair or Horn when they are burnt.</p>

And such as are, in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, horny, or look, bend, burn and smell like Horn.</p>
                           <p>A WOODY SHRUB. <hi>Frutex marinus verè ligneus.</hi> 'Tis here cut off from the Root. About a foot in height, with four Branches spread out as broad, and cover'd with several thick Knobs of a sort of softish white <hi>Coral;</hi> the sides of which Knobs are a ¼ of an inch thick; the surface almost like that of <hi>Poppy-Seed.</hi>

'Tis also of a softer substance, and more brittle. Of a Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple colour, almost like the woody part of <hi>Alkanet Root.</hi> Above ½ a foot high, and as broad. Several of the Branches united together, as in the <hi>Sea-Fan.</hi> Some of these <hi>Shrubs</hi> were found near the Straights of <hi>Gibraltar.</hi>

                           <p>A THIRD, with more numerous Branches than the former. Cover'd with a very thick, but soft Incrustation; originally of a Purple colour, but now for the most part turned brown; curiously perforated, as it were with Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holes, all round about.

The Root spread upon a stony <hi>Base,</hi> and of a brown colour. The Branches black both without and within; and swell, or huff, and stink, like Horn, in burning.</p>
                           <p>ANOTHER, spread also, in part, as a Tree. Half a yard high, and near as broad. Of a blackish colour; and stinks a little in burning; but swells not.

The Trunk somewhat dense, two inches high, and thick as a <hi>Goose-Quill.</hi> Divided into three principal Branches, and these into about thirty more of the same thickness with the Trunk it self, two or three inches long, perforated with some larger pores, as the <hi>Funel-Sponge,</hi> and near their tops, a little flat, and forked.</p>
                           <p>The CATSTAIL-SPONGE.

                           <p>IT hath been much disputed, and is not yet resolv'd, of many subterraneal Bodies, which have the semblance of <hi>Animals,</hi> or <hi>Parts</hi> of them, Whether they were ever such, or no. And I am not ignorant of the Arguments offer'd on both hands. If I may speak my own sense a little, Why not? Is there any thing repugnant in the matter? Why not a petrify'd Shell, as well as wood? Or is the place? If Shells are found under ground, far from Sea, or in Hills, unchanged; as we are sure they are; then why not petrify'd? Or is the form, to which no <hi>Species</hi> of Shells doth answer? The assertion is precarious: no man can say, how many are known to some one or other; much less, how many are not known: I have reason to believe, that scarce the one half of the under <hi>Species</hi> of Shells are known to this day. And so for <hi>Artisicials:</hi> if <hi>Coyns</hi> are found, every day under ground, then why not sometimes also Pictures, and other Works, in time petri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd? And although Nature doth often imitate her self; yet to make her in any case to imitate Art, is unphiloso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical and absurd: for the one, a natural reason may be given, not for the other.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="254" facs="tcp:47321:134"/>On the other side: although Nature cannot be said to imitate Art: yet it may fall out, that the effects of both may have some likeness. Those white Concretions which the <hi>Italians,</hi> from the place where they are found, call <hi>Confetti de Tibuli,</hi> are sometimes so like round <hi>Confects,</hi> and the rough kind of <hi>Sugar'd-Almonds,</hi> that by the eye they cannot be distinguish'd. To call these <hi>Petrify'd Sugar-Plums,</hi> were senseless. What if we find in some Stones under ground the likeness of a <hi>Cross?</hi> Doth not <hi>Sal Ammoniac</hi> often shoot into millions of little ones? Or do we find in other Stones the resemblance of Plants? Why not naturally there, as well as, in Frosty Weather, upon <hi>Glass Windows?</hi> Or as <hi>Salts</hi> sometimes figure themselves (as Sir <hi>Th. Brown,</hi> 
                              <note n="a" place="margin">Relig. Med.</note> and Dr. <hi>Daniel Cox</hi> 
                              <note n="b" place="margin">Phil. <hi>Trans. N.</hi> 108.</note> observe) into some likeness to the Plants whereof they are made. Nay, why not too, a Face, or other Animal Form? Since we see that there are divers <hi>Palm-Nuts</hi> which have the like. That the Volatile Salt of <hi>Harts-Horn,</hi> will shoot it self into the likeness of little branched Horns. That of <hi>Flesh</hi> or <hi>Blood,</hi> into the shape of little flat fibrous <hi>Tendons</hi> or <hi>Muscles,</hi> as I have often observ'd. And though I have not seen it my self, yet I have been told by one <note n="c" place="margin">
                                 <hi>Sir</hi> Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Milling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton.</note> that doth not use to phancy things, that the Volatile Salt of <hi>Vipers,</hi> will figure it self into the semblance of little <hi>Vipers.</hi> But there can be no convincing Argument given, why the Salts of Plants, or Animal Bodies, washed down with Rains, and lodged under ground; should not there be disposed into such like figures, as well as above it? Probably, in some cases, much better, as in a colder place; and where therefore the Work not being done in a hurry, but more slowly, may be so much the more regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar. I shall now come to the Particulars, and leave the <hi>Reader</hi> to judge of them.</p>
                           <p>Part of the Upper JAW of a strange HEAD, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with some fragments of other Bones, and three very Great Double TEETH, or Grinders, all supposed to be of the same Animal. Found, about twelve years since, seventeen feet under Ground, in <hi>Chartham</hi> a Village three miles from <hi>Canterbury.</hi> The Ground within twelve Rods of the River running thither, and so to <hi>Sandwich</hi>-Haven. An Account hereof is written by Mr. <hi>William Somner:</hi> yet without a Description of the <hi>Jaw.</hi> But supposing it to be part of
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:47321:134"/>
the Head of an <hi>Hippopotamus,</hi> takes occasion thence for a Discourse, wherein he endeavours to prove, That all the low Ground from the <hi>East-Kentish</hi> shore, to <hi>Romney-Marsh,</hi> was once under Water, and an Arm of the <hi>Sea.</hi> Published, since his Death, by his Brother Mr. <hi>John Somner:</hi> in whose Ground these Bones were dig'd up; and by whom they were bestowed upon this <hi>Musaeum.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>This <hi>Jaw-Bone,</hi> is only part of the far Cheek; about fifteen inches long, and seven where deepest: yet part of both the ends, and the <hi>Sockets</hi> of the <hi>Teeth</hi> are broken off. The <hi>Orbit</hi> of the Eye, neither so round, nor so big, as in the <hi>Hippopotamus:</hi> yet the <hi>Teeth</hi> far bigger. For the bigest <hi>Grinder</hi> in the Head of the <hi>Hippopotamus</hi> here preserv'd, is less than six inches about: one of these, near eight. And 'tis much, if they belonged to that Animal, that none of the long Cutters which grow before (as is represented in <hi>Tab.</hi> 1.) should be found with them.</p>
                           <p>Besides, in that Skull of the said Animal, the <hi>Orbits</hi> of the Eye stand so high, and the Forehead lies so low, that it looks like a Valley between two Hills: whereas in this Bone, the Forehead evidently stands higher than the Eye. The Knob also at the Corner of the Eye in this Bone, is six times as big, as in the said Skull. Although this perhaps, as well as the tuberousness of the Bone in some places, may be the effect of its lying so long under ground; as if it were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a little swell'd in those places: for they are more rare and soft, than the other, and the whole Bone, than the Skull of any grown Animal not bury'd. Considering all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it seems to me more likely to belong to a <hi>Rhinoceros,</hi> for the being whereof in this Country, we have as much ground to suppose it, as of the <hi>Hippopotamus.</hi> See <hi>Wormius</hi>'s Description of the Double Tooth <note n="a" place="margin">Mus. lib. 3.</note> of a <hi>Rhinoceros.</hi>

                           <p>Another of the same, more Concave.</p>
                           <p>A Third, broader, and more expanded.</p>
                           <p>A sort of MUSCULITES fill'd with Earth like <hi>Tobacco-Pipe</hi> Clay or Marle. Found amongst the earth of a Hill that was overturn'd at <hi>Kenebank</hi> in <hi>New England.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The square MUSCULITES. <hi>Musc. quadrilaterus.</hi> I have not yet met with any shell of answerable shape. 'Tis, as it were, bivalvous: and each Valve, hath two sides. Of the four, two are broader, and a little Convex, especially towards the <hi>Base,</hi> at the other end somewhat sharp: with oblique furrows, from the first to the last growing shorter. The other two, striated and plain, joyned with the former at obtuse Angles. Of a limy substance dissoluble with <hi>Acids.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The TOOTHLESS MUSCULE. Found, of several sizes, beded in a lump of <hi>Irish Slate:</hi> yet not petrify'd, but a perfect shell. It is of a rare kind, no where figured or men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd, that I find, nor have I met with it elsewhere. The biggest of them two inches long, and ¼ over. That end near the <hi>Base,</hi> as it were pinched up, almost into the form of a Childs fore-Tooth. On the outside of the <hi>Base,</hi> stands a plated piece, contiguous therewith at both ends, but in the middle, joyned to it by the intervention of other very small transverse Plates, like the Wards of a Lock: supply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the use of the Teeth in other <hi>Muscles,</hi> which are here wanting; from whence I have nam'd it. The outside, is adorn'd with circinated Lines, and in some sort also radiated with very small <hi>Tuberculi,</hi> especially at the narrow end.</p>

                              <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Of VEGETABLE BODIES petrify'd, and other like STONES.</head>
                           <p>OF this kind, here is also great variety; being, or representing, Fruits, parts of Flowers, Leaves, Branches, Stalks, Trunks, and Roots: in which order I shall set them down. Only reserving <hi>CORALS</hi> with other like <hi>Marine</hi> Productions, to be spoken of by themselves.</p>
                           <p>A Petrify'd KATHERINE PEAR, or a Stone naturally very like one. Being, as that is sometimes, a little bended, very
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:47321:140"/>
slender at the Stalk or Base; turbinated next the other end; umbellated at the top of all, or depressed round about the place of the flower; and of a yellowish tawny colour.</p>
                           <p>A STONE like a petrify'd DAMASCENE-PLUM. As that of a black colour, and of the same Figure; so far as to shew the seat both of the Stalk and Flower.</p>
                           <p>The Great petrify'd STONE of an exotick PLUM. As one would think, both from the figure of it, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of <hi>Fibers</hi> by the length, round about it, (as in many <hi>Indian Plum-Stones</hi>) very apparent especially, near the top. The granulated part of it, being turn'd to a soft opacous <hi>Stone;</hi> the <hi>Fibers</hi> into pellucid <hi>Flint.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>A black <hi>Stone</hi> figur'd like the STONE of (a <hi>Praecock-Plum</hi>) an <hi>Aprecock.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>A petrify'd <hi>NUX VOMICA, sc.</hi> that of the Shops. As I call it from its figure exactly respondent; being round, and flat, on one side a little Concave, on the other some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what Convex. In <hi>Aldrovandus</hi> 
                              <note n="a" place="margin">Mus. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall.</note> we have the Figure of a petrify'd <hi>Nux Methel Officinorum:</hi> but under the mistaken Title of <hi>Castanites.</hi> As also the exact figure of a petrify'd <hi>Castanea Purgatrix;</hi> but this too with the false Name of <hi>Anacardites.</hi> The same Author represents likewise a most exact figure of a petrify'd <hi>Melopepon.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>A large JUDIAC STONE (<hi>Lapis Judaicus</hi>) in the form of a PEAR. 'Tis an inch and half long; stalked like a <hi>Pear;</hi> Next the stalk slender; turbinated upwards, to an inch in Diametre; and umbellated at the top, or depres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed as a <hi>Pear,</hi> round about the flower. Adorned also round about with small tuberated <hi>Striae</hi> which run from end to end. This <hi>Species</hi> not well figur'd by any Author.</p>
                           <p>ANOTHER of a somewhat like Figure, but much smaller. Best expressed by the least of the four in <hi>Boe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius.</hi> 
                              <note n="b" place="margin">De Gem. &amp; Lap. l. 2. c. 226.</note>
                           </p>
                           <p>A THIRD like an <hi>ALMOND;</hi> both of the same big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and shape, oval at one end, pointed at the other, and somewhat flat. <hi>Besler</hi> hath one or two like this, which he calls <hi>Petrified Almonds.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>A FIFTH, like an <hi>AKORNE,</hi> being of a like thickness at both ends. Another of the same. This sort particularly called <hi>Phoenecites.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>A SIXTH, like an <hi>OLIVE-STONE;</hi> being more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:47321:140"/>
and oval than the precedent. <hi>Besler</hi> two or three <hi>Stones</hi> somewhat like this, which he calls <hi>Petrify'd Olives.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>A SEVENTH, of a long slender Figure, and knobed as the rest, almost like a <hi>Hazel Catkin.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>An EIGHTH, in shape like a <hi>Pestil.</hi> The upper part of this is knobed, the other smooth, whether naturally appears not.</p>
                           <p>These <hi>Stones</hi> either grow chiefly, or were first taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of in <hi>Judea;</hi> from whence their Name. They are commonly found, not in Earth, but in the Clefts of Rocks, by those that work in them. They are dissolved with <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> of <hi>Nitre,</hi> not without <hi>Esservescence,</hi> especially when reduced to powder. And may therefore be justly esteemed <hi>Diuretick,</hi> and so sometimes bring away, or (as people think) break the <hi>Stone:</hi> for which, by <hi>Pliny,</hi> 
                              <note n="a" place="margin">Lib. 37. c. 10.</note> 'tis call'd <hi>Teco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lithos.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>These <hi>Stones</hi> always break flaky, and with a strong gloss, like a <hi>Spar;</hi> or the <hi>Entrochus</hi> hereafter describ'd.</p>
                           <p>Of these <hi>Stones</hi> it is further observable, That being cut and polish'd <hi>transversly,</hi> and then wetted, they fairly exhibit, at least in colour, a twofold substance. The one, whitish; answering to the <hi>Parhenchyma</hi> or Flesh of a Fruit: the other black or dark-colour'd, not only in the Stalk, but also thence produced, and disposed into two Rings, a large one next the Circumference, and a small one in the centre of the <hi>Stone;</hi> answerable to the Lignous <hi>Fibers,</hi> distributed in much alike manner in some Fruits.</p>
                           <p>Two strait slender <hi>Stones,</hi> resembling the COLUMNS erected in the middle of some FLOWERS. One, Convex at the top, and almost flat. The other, spherically trian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, somewhat like the <hi>Seed-Case</hi> of a <hi>Tulip.</hi> Beneath, of an ash-colour; upward, of an obscure or brown Bay. Of that hardness, that if struck or let fall one upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they have a kind of Metallick sound, like that of small round <hi>Button-Bells.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Two other <hi>joynted Stones</hi> of the same nature with the former: looking as if they were pieces of the GENICU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LATED STALK of some Plant.</p>
                           <p>'Tis pleasant, especially with a Glass, to see the wrought Work on the surface of these <hi>Stones.</hi> In which the small and curious <hi>Striae</hi> which run by the length, answer to the
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:47321:141"/>
Lignous <hi>Fibers,</hi> or the warp: and those which are <hi>transversly</hi> as it were interwoven; to the <hi>Parenchymous Fibers,</hi> or Woofe of a Plant. A more particular explication of which real <hi>Work</hi> in all Plants, hath been by me elsewhere given. <note n="a" place="margin">See the Authors Book <hi>Of Trunks.</hi> And that <hi>Of Roots.</hi>
                              </note> 
                              <hi>Calceolarius</hi> hath one or two of these last fairly figur'd.</p>
                           <p>A <hi>Stone</hi> with the exact signature of a STEM of PO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LYPODY with the LEAVES. 'Tis softish, and somewhat brown. Stirreth not with <hi>Acids.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>HIPPURITES. Or a <hi>Stone</hi> with the impressed Image or signature of the <hi>Equisetum</hi> or HORSETAIL. There are three stalks which very elegantly rise up from one Root.</p>
                           <p>DENDRITES. Or a <hi>Flint</hi> naturally adorned with the Images of several epitomiz'd or minute TREES. There is the figure of a fair one like to this in <hi>Calceolarius's Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saeum.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>ANOTHER; being a SLATE about ⅓<hi rend="sup">d</hi> of an inch thick, representing, as it were, a plain Field, inclosed with a HEDGE of TREES; some bigger, others less; all so lively, as if it had been the curious and elaborate Work of a <hi>Painter;</hi> or had been cast through a Glass (as <hi>Kepler</hi> shews the way sometimes of taking <hi>Lanships</hi>) upon a <hi>Tablet</hi> in a Dark Room.</p>
                           <p>It is very observable, That the same curious Work which appears upon one side of the slate, doth also on the other. Agreeable to what <hi>Ambrosinus</hi> 
                              <note n="b" place="margin">Aldrov. Mus. Metall.</note> also remarques, That if this sort of <hi>Stones</hi> be broken into several pieces, the like Work will appear in the intimate parts. Which plainly demonstrates, that not being superficial, it cannot be the effect of Art.</p>
                           <p>DENDROPOTAMITES. So I call it. 'Tis a piece of a kind of <hi>Alabaster,</hi> about seven or eight inches square, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd and set in a Frame. It hath much and pleasing varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty both in colour and figure: shewing a mixture of brown, tawny, white, and green; and not unaptly resembling a couple of <hi>Rivers.</hi> One crooked or very much winding too and fro; (as the <hi>Thames</hi> at <hi>Kingstone</hi>) and garbed all along with <hi>Trees</hi> upon the Bank. The other strait, with a <hi>Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>walk</hi> upon the Bank, and inclosed also with a little <hi>Hedge-Row.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>A sort of ALABASTRITES, representing a <hi>Transverse Section</hi> of the TRUNK of a TREE. That part answering
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:47321:141"/>
to the Wood, consisting of white and black Rings one within another. The other answering to the Barque, of two or three thin ones (like that of a <hi>Cherry-Tree</hi>) of a russet or barque colour. Yet the black Rings, being held up against the light, are transparent. So the clearest Glass, in some postures, appears black. <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Nitre</hi> droped on it, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves it with a vehement <hi>Effervescence.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>A <hi>Stone</hi> expressing part of a <hi>Tranverse Section</hi> of OLIVE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>WOOD. On one side, 'tis very well polish'd. By means whereof, not only the <hi>Annual Rings</hi> (appearing in the Trunks of all Trees;) but also the <hi>Insertions</hi> or <hi>Parenchy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Rays</hi> which run betwixt the Pith and Barque; and even the greater Vessels themselves (either for <hi>Aer</hi> or <hi>Sap</hi>) are all to a good naked eye, but especially with the help of a Glass, very fairly visible. 'Tis just of the colour of the browner sort of <hi>Olive-Wood</hi> well varnish'd. 'Tis as hard as a <hi>Jasper,</hi> and seems to be of that kind.</p>
                           <p>ANOTHER sort of <hi>Jasper</hi> representing a piece of WOOD. 'Tis of a green colour, and stained with blackish spots. One would take it for a sort of <hi>Lignum Vitae.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>A <hi>Stone,</hi> which in Colour and Texture, seems to resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a piece of <hi>YEW-TREE.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>ANOTHER, which looks like a piece of <hi>BEECH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>WOOD.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>A large piece of PETRIFY'D WOOD (as it is supposed) above half a yard long, and ¼ of a yard about.</p>
                           <p>Another Piece about the same bigness.</p>
                           <p>A <hi>Globular Stone,</hi> which looks as if it had been a piece of <hi>ASH-WOOD</hi> turned in a <hi>Lathe</hi> into that figure. For it hath not only the colour, but the semblance of the Annual Rings, and of the <hi>Aer-Vessels,</hi> as in that Wood.</p>
                           <p>Small pieces of (reputed) petrify'd Wood, commonly found between the Beds of blew Marble. Two inches long, and near as thick as ones little Finger. Almost as black as <hi>Ebony.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>A Piece of INCOMBUSTIBLE Wood, as it were HALF PETRIFY'D. For being held in the fire, it becomes red like a Coal; but neither flames, nor smoaks in the least.</p>
                           <p>A very odd Piece of the BRANCH of a TREE as thick as a <hi>Cable-Rope,</hi> whereof the Barque is turned into perfect Iron, or at least a very rich Iron <hi>Ore;</hi> and the Wood into Stone.</p>

                              <pb n="270" facs="tcp:47321:142"/>The petrify'd Barque of a Tree. 'Tis thin, and rowled up as <hi>Cinamon;</hi> but rather of the colour of that called <hi>Winterane's.</hi> Withall, rough and knobed without.</p>
                           <p>A Piece of <hi>Oak</hi> BARQUE cover'd with a stony Crust. Given by <hi>Philip Packer</hi> 
                              <abbr>Esq</abbr> From a Stump above Ground.</p>
                           <p>In <hi>Septalius's Musaeum,</hi> as I take it, is mention made of <hi>Petrify'd Wood</hi> found an hundred and forty <hi>Pertches</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the top of a Mountain. And by <hi>Kentman</hi> 
                              <note n="a" place="margin">Fossil.

But what kind of Eln is here meant, is not certain.</p>
                           <p>Of petrify'd Woods it may be noted, That none of them (at least of these here described) will make the least <hi>Ebullition</hi> with any <hi>Acid.</hi> Which would make one sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, That they are <hi>Stones</hi> originally, <hi>sui generis;</hi> else it were strange, That some of them should not lie in places where such <hi>Stones</hi> are bred, which with <hi>Acids</hi> make the said <hi>Ebullition.</hi>

                           <p>A ROUND one, near ¾ of an inch Diametre; with the Pith near a ¼, of a darker colour, hard and dense. The

several Joynts, about the tenth of an inch thick; distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished by slender Circles composed of very small knobs. With part of the Rock to which it grew, altogether irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, but of the same substance.</p>
                           <p>ANOTHER, with a Pith larger and more soft, the Joynts thicker, and the Surface almost smooth.</p>
                           <p>A THIRD, of the same thickness, with the Pith ½ an inch Diametre. 'Tis also a little bended; and the Joynts distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished not with knobed but entire Rings.</p>
                           <p>A FOURTH, with a Pith not much bigger than to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a little <hi>Pin.</hi> Yet at one end 'tis ½ an inch over. At the other somewhat more than <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Their circumference, convex, being distinguished not with edged Rings, as the former, but with furrows.</p>
                           <p>A FIFTH, about ¼ of an inch over. The Pith answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. The Joynts distinguished with edged Rings. And as thick as in the former.</p>
                           <p>A SIXTH of the same thickness. And a little crooked. The Joynts distinguish with furrows.</p>
                           <p>A SEVENTH, with the Joynts unequal both in breadth and thickness; one narrower and thiner, the next broader, or standing further out from the centre, and thicker, and so alternately: whereby it looks like some sort of Turn'd-Work.</p>
                           <p>An EIGHTH, a small one, yet finely shap'd. First with a Joynt embossed with a knobed Ring. Next two small Joynts, each of them scarce thicker than a <hi>Groat;</hi> and so alternately.</p>
                           <p>A NINTH, not above ⅙<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of an inch in Diametre; yet with Joynts as thick as in the fourth: and smooth.</p>

                           <p>CORALLITES. As it may be call'd. With no Joynts, no Rays, nor Pith, but more like to a solid piece of <hi>Coral.</hi>

                           </p>
                           <p>The BRANCHED ENTROCHITE. Yet here the Branches, which grew alternately as Twigs on a Bough, are broken off. In one, leaving so many cavities in the <hi>Trunk</hi> on which they grew. In another, so many Knots. In both, radiated, and containing a <hi>Pith,</hi> as the <hi>Trunk</hi> it self.</p>
                           <p>The KNOTED ENTROCHITE. A very odd <hi>Species.</hi> Above two inches long, and ¾ in Diametre. The Surface smooth, yet with an obscure appearance of Joynts. The Knots, no way like those in the last mention'd, as not being radiated; and looking more like the bases of sturdy <hi>Thornes.</hi> Wherewith it not unaptly resembles a piece of a <hi>Crab-Tree-Cudgel.</hi> 'Tis composed of three distinct substances. The outer part, (as one would say, the Barque) is a flaky and glossy <hi>Spar,</hi> as in the rest.

                           <p>The SYNTROCHITE, as we may name it, to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish it from the rest. It consists of several Joynts as the former; yet not piled evenly one over another so as to make a <hi>Cylinder:</hi> but sliden as it were half on and half off.</p>
                           <p>The TROCHITES. 'Tis nothing else but one of the above described Joynts single; on both sides radiated, and also containing a <hi>Pith.</hi> So that it looks like a slice of a stick. These, saith Mr. <hi>Lyster,</hi> being usually hollow, or easily so made, and stringed, are therefore by some called St. <hi>CUTH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BERDS BEADS.</hi>

                              <pb n="273" facs="tcp:47321:143"/>There's one which may be called an <hi>Enthrochite,</hi> yet not a <hi>Stelechite,</hi> because Oval, or at least smaller at both ends; no way resembling a Stick or Branch. But there is no example hereof in this <hi>Musaeum.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The True STELECHITES, branched. 'Tis not only ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diated, and furnished with a Pith: but is one single piece with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Joynts or joynted Wheels: in which respect, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be called <hi>ENTROCHUS;</hi> but very properly <hi>Stelechites,</hi> (from whence the <hi>English</hi> word <hi>Stalk</hi>) as more answerable to the <hi>make</hi> of a stick or stalk, than are any of the rest. 'Tis of an ash-colour, and curiously wrought all over in the like manner as a <hi>Poppy-Seed.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>A Piece of a Rock consisting wholly of several <hi>Species</hi> of <hi>ENTROCHI</hi> or <hi>Stelentrochi,</hi> immersed in a bed of their Mother-Clay.</p>
                           <p>Another, with two or three small <hi>STELECHITES.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>A hard Stone of the colour of a <hi>Magnet,</hi> with the signa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a <hi>TROCHITES.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>These Stones being broken, look flaky, and with a gloss, as the <hi>Lapis Judaicus;</hi> but somewhat more obscure. They also make a like <hi>Effervescence</hi> with <hi>Acids,</hi> especially with <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Nitre.</hi> And may probably be as good a <hi>Diure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick.</hi> That <hi>All Fossiles</hi> of what figure soever make an <hi>Ebullition</hi> with <hi>Vinegar,</hi> is affirmed by Mr. <hi>Lyster: (a)</hi> but<note place="margin">Phil. <hi>Trans. N.</hi> 100.</note> was a slip of his, otherwise most accurate Pen. For there are many, and those of several figures, which, although powder'd, yet are so far from making any <hi>Ebullition</hi> with <hi>Vinegar,</hi> that neither <hi>Oil</hi> of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> nor <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Nitre</hi> it self, (which taketh place sometimes where the former doth not) will stir them: as appears in several Instances in this Catalogue.</p>
                           <p>They are found in as great variety here in <hi>England,</hi> as in any other Country. By Mr. <hi>Lyster,</hi> in certain <hi>Scarrs</hi> in <hi>Braughton</hi> and <hi>Stock,</hi> two little <hi>Villages</hi> in <hi>Craven:</hi> in some places of the Rock as hard as <hi>Marble.</hi> In such plenty, that there are whole Beds of Rock made of them. By Mr. <hi>Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi> in <hi>Mundip-Hills;</hi> in the Rocks, from the Grass to twenty fathome: but most in Beds of a grey and <hi>gristy</hi> Clay. In a <hi>Grotto,</hi> five and thirty fathome deep, he observed their growth: which was, from the finest, and the softest of the Clay. At first, they were whitish, soft, and smooth.
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:47321:144"/>
Afterwards, grew hard, and ridged, or divided into <hi>Trochi</hi> or Joynts; beginning at the top, and so descending. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the while in a manner quicken'd with Mineral Steams; conveyed, from the Mother-Bed, through the Pith of the several Feet of the Root (which Mr. <hi>Lyster</hi> figures) and of the Stock it self.</p>
                           <p>It were also further worth the enquiry, In what Time, one of these <hi>Stones</hi> will grow up. Whether it doth so, by <hi>Starts,</hi> as <hi>Ice</hi> often doth, and as I have seen a little <hi>Icy-Tree</hi> to grow level upon a Table? And whether so much as serves for the making of a single Joynt, at every <hi>start?</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>A <hi>Stone</hi> figur'd like a Piece of <hi>ANGELIC A Root;</hi> with a large <hi>Pith,</hi> and very distinct <hi>Rays,</hi> as the <hi>Cortical Insertions</hi> in that, or other like Root round about.</p>
                           <p>TWO lesser round ones or more <hi>Cylindrical:</hi> one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling the Root of <hi>CICHORY;</hi> the other of <hi>TORMEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TILE.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>A STONE somewhat FLAT, like the Root of <hi>Iris:</hi> but radiated as the former. More visible, if one end, being first polished, be then made wet; for so, both the <hi>Pith</hi> and <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation</hi> are very distinct.</p>
                           <p>A FOURTH, as it were bared of the Rind; and having one end with a kind of <hi>Button,</hi> on which the <hi>Rays</hi> wind toward the Centre; as the Lines of a Rumb upon a Map, or the Suits of the Attire of any Corymbiferous Flower.</p>
                           <p>All these seem to be several stumps of Stone Roots, on which the above described Stones often grow.</p>
                           <p>A FIFTH, with a <hi>Pith</hi> and <hi>Rays;</hi> but CONICK and CROOKED, not unlike the young buded Horn of a <hi>Calf.</hi>

                           <p>The MOTHER of the TURCOIS, as is supposed. Found in the Mines of <hi>Herngrunt</hi> in <hi>Hungary;</hi> and given by Dr. <hi>Edward Browne.</hi> Here are two Pieces. One of them, for the greatest part, blew; with some places black.
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:47321:154"/>
In which is also immersed a sort of small Sand-colour'd Stones, so hard as to scratch Glass. The other, hath also a mixture of some parts that are Green. The Blew and the Green, are both, and they only dissoluble upon the effusion of <hi>Acids.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The best of these Stones are the Blewest. <note n="a" place="margin">Boet. de Gem.</note> They have also this property; <hi>sc.</hi> to look blew by Day, <note n="b" place="margin">Laet de Gem.</note> and Green by Candle-light. Many, saith <hi>Boetius,</hi> have judged this to be reckon'd by <hi>Pliny,</hi> amongst <hi>Jaspers</hi> with the Name of <hi>Boreas.</hi> But either <hi>Pliny</hi> and the Ancients, or those that make that judgment of them, were greatly mistaken. For this is a very soft Stone, and easily dissoluble, with <hi>Ebullition,</hi> immediately upon the effusion of some, especially Nitrous <hi>Acids:</hi> and may be scraped with a <hi>Knife.</hi> So that I am of Opinion; That 'tis nothing else but a sort of <hi>Aerugo</hi> in some measure petrify'd. Which also is further confirm'd in that it doth not only resemble that in Colour, but, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (as it is easily) burnt, is of the same Tast. So that it is no marvail, if this Stone, with Age and especially much worn and exposed to the Air, looseth the beauty of its colour. And that it may be restored to the same by <hi>Oil of Vitriol;</hi> which eateth off its faded Surface.</p>

                           <p>AS <hi>Gems</hi> are distinguished chiefly by their <hi>Colours;</hi> so other <hi>Stones Regular,</hi> by their external <hi>Forms.</hi> This is of two general kinds. Such as is <hi>Circumscriptive,</hi> or depending upon the whole <hi>Stone,</hi> as <hi>ex. gr.</hi> in the <hi>Eagle-Stone;</hi> and this is properly call'd the <hi>Figure.</hi> Or such as is <hi>Accumulative,</hi> where there is a repetition of the same Figure in several parts, as in <hi>Muscovy-Glass,</hi> composed of parallel Plates: and so for the rest, whereof in their order.</p>
                           <p>A GLOBULAR PEBBLE, an inch and ¼ in Diametre, whitish and semiperspicuous. It seems to be an Assay to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Eagle-Stone,</hi> hereafter describ'd.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="295" facs="tcp:47321:154"/>A CLUSTER'D PISOLYTHOS. It consisteth of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bular and bay Stones, united together with an Ash-colour'd Cement: But this is very hard, and stirs not with <hi>Acids. Boetius</hi> and others figure a Cluster of these, but somewhat bigger.</p>
                           <p>This <hi>Stone</hi> may seem to belong to the second general kind above-said. But is really a heap of distinct <hi>Stones</hi> in one Bed. Which is also to be understood of others alike.</p>
                           <p>ANOTHER, composed of <hi>Globular Stones,</hi> consisting of a whitish, and soft or friable substance; yet gritty, and indissoluble with <hi>Acids.</hi> United together with a brown Cement.</p>
                           <p>A SINGLE one of the same Figure, but bigger; <hi>sc.</hi> as big as a Physical Pill. As also semipellucid, almost as the bay <hi>Amber.</hi> Very hard and indissoluble with <hi>Acids.

                           <p>The SINEPITES, as it may be called. Being a Cluster of small hard <hi>Globules,</hi> like <hi>Mustard-seeds;</hi> and united together with an obscure or dull Red Cement. Given by Sig<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Boccone.</hi>

                           <p>The MECONITES. A Cluster of other like <hi>Globules</hi> no bigger than <hi>Poppy-seeds.</hi> See one of these in <hi>Boetius</hi> and <hi>Besler.</hi> These two last, are properly of the <hi>Hammites</hi> kind; but not the <hi>Pisolythos,</hi> although accounted so by <hi>Boetius.</hi> Of these <hi>Globules,</hi> it is observable with the help of a Glass, That although they are so very small, yet are they shell'd, or composed of little <hi>Balls</hi> one within another, as the <hi>Bezoar-Stone.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The CLUSTER'D STALAGMITES. A Congeries of <hi>Globular Stones,</hi> like so many petrify'd Drops; of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of Oriental <hi>Bezoar;</hi> cemented together with a kind of <hi>Gypsum.</hi> The whole Mass, which here is polish'd, is two inches and ½ square, and an inch high. This, and the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Stones of affinity herewith, differ from the five former, not so much in figure, as in substance, these being all instantly dissoluble with <hi>Acids.</hi> So that they seem to be a kind of <hi>Gypsum,</hi> first dissolved in some Mineral <hi>Menstruum,</hi> and after setling in this Figure.</p>
                           <p>The CORALLINE STALAGMITES, also cluster'd. It

                           <p>The POROUS STALAGMITES. 'Tis a ruder <hi>Species,</hi> the Stones of which it is composed, being not so distinct and round, as in the former. Cover'd all over with one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Crust. Yet most of them pounced with small or more open pores.</p>
                           <p>A SINGLE one, call'd <hi>PISUM CAROLINUM;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause frequently bred in the <hi>Caroline Baths.</hi> Whitish, smooth and dense; and near as big as a <hi>Pistol Bullet.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Two SINGLE ones. Given by Sir <hi>Philip Skippon.</hi> Of a glossy Ash-colour, and very dense substance: yet easily dissolved with <hi>Spirit of Nitre.</hi> These are somewhat angular.</p>
                           <p>Two more, which are TWINS. These are perfectly round, except where they joyn together.</p>
                           <p>A Great TIBULINE SUGAR-PLUM. This and the other Rough sorts the <hi>Italians</hi> call <hi>Confetti de Tibuli;</hi> the place (not far from <hi>Rome</hi>) where they are bred. 'Tis above 1/<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                           <p>The SUGAR-ALMOND, bred also in the same place. In colour, figure, size, and surface, so like to the rougher sort which <hi>Confectioners</hi> sometimes make, that, excepting the Tast, nothing can be liker.</p>
                           <p>Three STONES found very deep under ground near <hi>Hartford</hi> in <hi>New England.</hi> One of an Oval Figure, flatish, and having a little <hi>Globule</hi> standing upon its centre.

The Third, much bigger than the former, of a circular Figure, and flat; an inch and ¼ over; almost like the <hi>Caps</hi> worn by <hi>Under-Graduates</hi> in our Universities.

                           </p>
                           <p>A little round, flat, and blackish Stone, resembling a

Several sorts hereof are here preserv'd.</p>
                           <p>The FLORID Male EAGLE-STONE. A rare kind. 'Tis a perfect <hi>Flint,</hi> and semiperspicuous; of a Globular Figure, and as big as a good big <hi>Apple,</hi> or near three inches in Diametre. Flourished all round about with several sets of <hi>Rings</hi> one included within another, with some simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to so many little <hi>Roses</hi> or double <hi>Crowfoot-Flowers.</hi> 'Tis very ponderous, being almost solid. Yet hollow at the centre; containing not one, but several small <hi>Stones,</hi> as is argu'd from the noise they make, upon shaking the <hi>Stone.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>An ANGULAR or Ridged Male EAGLE-STONE. This also is about the bigness of a good large <hi>Apple.</hi> Of a brown colour, but daubed over with a kind of <hi>Okre;</hi> and was therefore probably bred in a Bed of the same. 'Tis very heavy; which argues it almost solid, as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and to have only a small hollow in the centre.</p>
                           <p>An ORBICULAR EAGLE-STONE. About the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of a midling <hi>Apple.</hi> The outside, rough and brown. Inwardly black. The Concave surface daubed with a sort of <hi>Okre;</hi> a quantity of which, 'tis likely, it once con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd.</p>
                           <p>An OVAL EAGLE Stone. About as big as a midling <hi>Walnut.</hi> Without, blackish and rough, as it were granulated with some semiperspicuous Sands. Smooth within, and of a spruce<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                           <p>One half of an OVAL EAGLE Stone. 'Tis near three inches in Diametre. The inside rough-cast with small Grains, in size, like those of <hi>Bay-Salt;</hi> so hard as to cut Glass.</p>

                           <p>The AMYGDALINE EAGLE Stone. Shaped like an <hi>Almond.</hi> Of a glossy brown, like half bright Iron. It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains a sort of <hi>Bole,</hi> of the colour of <hi>Fullers-Earth.</hi>

                           <p>A Rough and hard EAGLE Stone, the Concave surface whereof is daubed with a soft white wash, a kind of <hi>Gypsum,</hi> dissoluble with <hi>Spirit of Nitre.</hi>

                           <p>A CRYSTAL of TALK. <hi>Wormius</hi> describes <hi>Talk,</hi> to be a <hi>Stone</hi> divisible into flat <hi>Plates,</hi> variously intricated, and divisible like <hi>Silver,</hi> which is all he saith of the form, and his words unintelligible. Far from a definition of that form, which, so often, as its Concretion proceeds freely on all sides, or without hinderance from any adjacent Body, it doth obtain: being then, a Congeries of flat, and perspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous <hi>Plates,</hi> somewhat pliable, and figur'd into a kind of double Rhomboid; or as it were two Squares, with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal Sides and Angles, clapt together, with the edges pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, to distinguish them: so, as to obtain twelve Angles, and ten Sides, <hi>sc.</hi> eight lesser, and two greater ones. A piece thus figur'd, I call <hi>A Crystal of Talk.</hi> And of this the form is both <hi>Accumulative</hi> and <hi>Circumscriptive:</hi> the difference betwixt which is shewed in the beginning of this Chapter.</p>
                           <p>An HALF-CRYSTAL, having only six sides, four lesser, and two greater ones; as if it were a perfect one, split.</p>
                           <p>A piece of FOLIATED TALK. It consisteth of seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral pieces, pellucid, cleveable, and something pliable, of a Rhomboid Figure, and composed together so as to resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the indented leave of <hi>Wild Clary.</hi>

                           <p>A large Piece of TALK, above ½ a foot square.</p>

                           <p>
                              <hi>Talk,</hi> although flexible, and regularly figur'd, yet feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no <hi>Acid;</hi> and is of that obstinate nature, as neither to melt, nor scarce loose its colour, in the fire. Considering which, and that all <hi>Salts,</hi> yet known, will flow: I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to think, That it hath not its Figure from any <hi>Salt;</hi> but is almost a simple Earth <hi>sui generis.</hi> And that there are earthy Particles, as well as <hi>Saline,</hi> which are regularly figur'd; and of which this and some other <hi>Stones</hi> are composed. Hereof is prepared a wash for the Face, which some <hi>Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mysts</hi> cry up for the best in the World.</p>
                           <p>A GREEN TALK-SPAR. The whole piece, is here of a rude Figure; but is easily broken into Rhomboid Plates, resembling those of <hi>Talk,</hi> from whence I have nam'd it. 'Tis tinged with a pale Green. It stirreth not with any <hi>Acid.</hi> Yet is not flexible, as true <hi>Talk,</hi> but brittle as <hi>Glass.</hi>

                           <p>A great <hi>Crystalline</hi> TALK-SPAR. So I call it. Sent by Dr. <hi>Erasmus Bartholine,</hi> together with a large account of it, published in a the <hi>Phil. Transactions.</hi>

Of a Rhomboid Figure, and the narrow sides likewise sloaped, as in the <hi>Crystals of Talk.</hi> It breaketh also into parts of the same Figure, or near it. Yet not flexible, but brittle. Polite, colourless, and transparent, as the clearest <hi>Chrystal.</hi> Yet soft and dissoluble especially with Nitrous Spirits; and by a strong fire reduceable to a <hi>Calx.</hi> Of a very different na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from <hi>Crystal,</hi> although the said Dr. is pleased so to call it.

That which he principally Notes is, That the Objects seen through it, in certain positions, appear sometimes single, sometimes double, and sometimes sixfold. Which he ascribes to a <hi>Refraction</hi> peculiar to this <hi>Stone.</hi> And to me, it seems pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, That this various Refraction depends upon the structure of the <hi>Stone, sc.</hi> as it is not one piece absolutely entire, but composed of several <hi>Plates;</hi> and those not all

                           <p>The RHOMBICK LEAD-SPAR. Frequently found in the <hi>Lead-Mines</hi> in <hi>Derbyshire,</hi> and in others. By some called <hi>English Talk.</hi> But very improperly. For though it consisteth of several <hi>Plates,</hi> yet not flexible, but brittle as Glass. Besides, 'tis not of a Rhomboid, but Rhombiek Figure, that is, a Diamond-square, or with the Angles un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal, the sides equal. Nor doth <hi>Talk</hi> feel any <hi>Acid,</hi> but this with <hi>Spirit of Nitre</hi> is easily dissolved. It breaks into pieces, which, though never so small, yet retain the same Figure. Being burned, it yieldeth a Lixivial Salt.</p>
                           <p>A clear FLINT, of the colour of yellow <hi>Amber,</hi> with <hi>Striae</hi> on the sides shaped into little Rhombes.</p>
                           <p>A RHOMB of MUSCOVY-GLASS. This Stone is by most called <hi>Selenites.</hi> By some <hi>Mariae Glacies.</hi> By <hi>Agricola,</hi> and <hi>Kentman, Magnetis.</hi> By <hi>Ambrosinus,</hi>

                           <p>ANOTHER, of a pale Green colour, with a kind of silver gloss, and semiperspicuous.</p>
                           <p>Another, of the colour of tarnish'd <hi>Copper</hi> mixed with black.</p>

                           <p>A FLORENTINE SLATE. A sort of <hi>Saxum fissile.</hi> Hereon is naturally represented the PROSPECT of a City, Houses, Churches and Steeples, standing in length. To make them all visible, it must be wetted.</p>

                           <p>Another with the like PROSPECT; but shewing it, as at a much greater distance.</p>
                           <p>Another, with one half of the TOWN on a Rock, the other in a Plain. There are some of this kind in <hi>Septalius</hi>'s <hi>Musaeum.</hi>

                           <p>A SALTRAM SLATE. Very like to <hi>Efford-slate</hi> (used for Writing, and Mathematick Schemes) but not all out so good.</p>
                           <p>An odd SLATE with yellow <hi>Mundick</hi> in small Grains or Sparks immerced throughout the body of it.</p>
                           <p>RUMPLEY-STONE. A common blewish Slate, for colour and substance. But excelleth, in that it rises large enough for Building. It may be cleft as thin as you please.</p>
                           <p>A kind of whitish Slate, mixed with a rusly Iron-colour: plentiful in some Mines.</p>
                           <p>Some others; one grey and spotted with tawny. Another, of a brown Purple. A Third, Red. These abound in the High-Ways about the Mines in <hi>Cornwall.</hi> With these may be placed.</p>
                           <p>The WAXEN VEIN. <hi>Ludus Helmontij.</hi> A Stone com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed of two distinct Bodies. One, and the far greater, is
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:47321:163" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of a dirty ash-colour: in substance, not unlike the <hi>Lime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone.</hi> The other, somewhat harder; runs through it in several <hi>Veins,</hi> or rather <hi>Plates,</hi> as being usually plain, as thick as the back of a slender <hi>Knife,</hi> and exactly of the colour of yellow Wax; for which cause I have plac'd it amongst the <hi>Plated Stones,</hi> and taken leave for the <hi>English</hi> Name. Both of these two Bodies make an <hi>Effervescence</hi> with <hi>Spirit of Nitre,</hi> but the ash-colour'd, the greater.</p>
                           <p>The PIPED WAXEN-VEIN. So I call it, for that the greater ash-colour'd Body inclosed within the yellow <hi>Plates,</hi> is stuffed top full of small <hi>Cylinders</hi> and <hi>Tubes</hi> irregularly placed: most of which seem to be of the same yellowish substance, as the <hi>Plates.</hi> This <hi>Species</hi> hath some affinity with the piped <hi>Osteocolla</hi> above describ'd.</p>
                           <p>The STARRED WAXEN-VEIN. Given by Sir <hi>Rob. Moray.</hi> Found in the Isle of <hi>Sheapy.</hi> On one part of the Stone grows a fair Star, with many Rays, about an inch long, white and glossy: from whence I name it. This Star is of a quite different nature from the Stone on which it grows, as making no <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                              <hi>Effervescence</hi> with <hi>Acids,</hi> and in figure agreeing rather with the <hi>Pyrites.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>A Piece of WAXEN VEIN, with doubled <hi>Plates;</hi> in some places, as it were efflorescent with several little pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuberances consubstantial.</p>
                           <p>From the Description of this Stone above given, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that <hi>Wormius</hi> was mistaken, in reckoning it amongst <hi>Flints.</hi> This is that, which <hi>Paracelsus</hi> so much extols for a <hi>Lithontriptick.</hi> And thus far I believe, that 'tis a very good <hi>Diuretick;</hi> and may therefore sometimes be very well used for the carrying off of <hi>Gravel.</hi> But let all that have any Stone too big to be voided, take heed of such Medicines.</p>
                           <p>PLATED MARBLE. It seems to have been originally a striated Bole. Now a Stone as hard as Marble, composed of Portions, of an inch thick, colour'd, growing parallel, or as it were <hi>stratum super stratum;</hi> from whence I have nam'd, and here plac'd it.</p>
                           <p>Several soft PLATED STONES, found in the same place, and of the same colour and substance, with the <hi>Fish-Mould</hi> formerly describ'd. One of them, Globular, a little compressed on the two opposite sides: but composed
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:47321:163"/>
of <hi>Plates</hi> or <hi>Crusts</hi> narrowed from the middle of the Stone both ways, so as to make that Figure. A second, Oval, with three Hemispherick knobs appendent; all plated, as the Globular. A fourth and fifth figur'd almost like a Finger.</p>
                           <p>THUS FAR of <hi>Plated Stones.</hi> Next of those which we may call <hi>Fibrous.</hi> In the former, the Parts are answerable to the leaves in a piece of <hi>Past-board.</hi> In these to the <hi>Bristles</hi> in a <hi>Brush,</hi> or the <hi>Threads</hi> in a <hi>Skeine</hi> of <hi>Silk.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>THRUM-STONE, as I call it. <hi>Amianthus Lapis &amp; Asbesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</hi> It grows in short Threads or Thrums, from about a ¼ of an inch to an inch in length; parallel, and glossy; as fine, as those small single Threads the <hi>Silk-Worm</hi> spins; and very flexile, like Flax or Tow. Nothing answers it better, than the hard fibrous part of a large <hi>Oyster,</hi> when 'tis stew'd. Here are several pieces, both of White and Green. Of which, the latter hath the longest Threads, and the most flexile.</p>

And, upon search, meeting with no means effectual to recover it; considered with himself, That as in Morals, the exercise of Virtue, makes it more generous; and that Animal Motions, by use, become more vigorous: so it might possibly prove also as to some Properties of Inanimate Bodies. Whereupon, he hung as much at his Stone, as it would bear; and so left it for the space of some Weeks. Then, returning to it, and applying more weight to the former, it very easily held the same. And repeating the addition of more weight, at several periods in the space of about two years; he at last found, That his Stone had not only recovered its former strength, but encreas'd it; for whereas before he had never known it to take up more than sixteen, it would now take up twenty times its own weight. And he is now continuing the Experiment, to see how far it will go further.</p>

The <hi>Copperas</hi> Stones or Fire-Stones are found on the <hi>Sea-shore</hi> in <hi>Essex, Hamphire,</hi> and so Westward; the best of a bright Silver-colour. For the making of <hi>Copperas,</hi>
                              <pb n="342" facs="tcp:47321:178"/>
they make Beds sometimes an hundred feet long, and fifteen broad at top; well ram'd first with <hi>Clay,</hi> and then with <hi>Chalk.</hi> In these Beds the said Stones are laid about two feet thick: which by <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Rain,</hi> are gradually dissolv'd; and in five or six years time, begin to turn into a kind of <hi>Vitriolick Earth,</hi> which will swell and ferment like levened-Dough.

                           <p>A White EARTH, with a Ray of Red; very soft, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any grit, and inaffected with <hi>Acids.</hi> Nor hath it the common Tast of <hi>Boles,</hi> but is altogether insipid. Found in the same place, as the former; but in different Veins. Supposed to be the <hi>Embrio</hi> of white and red <hi>Marble.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>A BOLE of a yellowish sandy colour; somewhat gritty and friable.</p>
                           <p>SILESIAN BOLE. Of a redish yellow, exactly like the paler <hi>Emplastrum de Minio.</hi> As dense as any other, crack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling a little betwixt the Teeth. Yet without the least Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of Grit; feels as smooth as <hi>Castile-Soap;</hi> scrapes with a gloss; and breaks like <hi>Bees-Wax,</hi> or the Salve above-said. Tasteth like other <hi>Boles.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The BOHEMICK sealed BOLE. It agrees in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties with the former; saving that it hath somewhat more of red.</p>
                           <p>The HEPATICK BOLE of LEMNOS. Of kin to the red <hi>Lemnian.</hi> And answers to that which <hi>Wormius</hi> describes by the Name of <hi>Terra sigillata hepatica.</hi> It stirreth not with <hi>Acids.</hi>
                           </p>

                           <p>I take the principal Difference between <hi>Earths,</hi> as applied to Medical Use, to be this, That some are not affected with <hi>Acids;</hi> others are: Those, <hi>Pauperes</hi> or <hi>Fatuae;</hi> coming nearer to simple or meer <hi>Earths;</hi> These <hi>Saline,</hi> or impregnated with a Mineral <hi>Alkali,</hi> and therefore of greater energy.</p>
                           <p>A smooth and pale redish CLAY, lying in a little vein, running <hi>East</hi> and <hi>West,</hi> through a great Pillar of Sand, in a firme <hi>Marble-Rock.</hi> Supposed to be the <hi>Embrio</hi> of the red <hi>Marble.</hi>

                           <p>Red LEMNOS EARTH. As red as <hi>Radle;</hi> but much more close and coherent, and so colours not the Fingers. <hi>Theophrastus</hi>

But I meet with no <hi>Register</hi> hereof. The different Proportions of the said parts, as they are observable in the several <hi>Viscera,</hi> I may have occasion else where to represent. I shall now only note, That the fixed <hi>Salts</hi> of <hi>Blood</hi> above mention'd, are three of them Grey, and all but weak. The fourth, <hi>viz.</hi> that of the serous part of an <hi>Oxes,</hi> although calcined to whiteness; yet is not so strong, as That of most Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables.</p>

So far, that the promiscuous use of some of them, in Physick, is
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:47321:183"/>
unsafe: as, for instance, of <hi>Tartar</hi> and <hi>Wormwood;</hi> half a Scruple of the former, being as strong as one whole Scruple of the latter.

                           <hi>Apr.</hi> 3. 1679. The first of this kind was made by Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur <hi>Baldwin,</hi> a <hi>German</hi> Lawyer who gave it the Name above, but with no direction for the making of it. Nor doth he so much as mention the Materials.</p>
                        <p>I call it <hi>Solid,</hi> to distinguish it from two Liquid kinds. The Author of one, supposed to be Mr. <hi>Dan. Krafft.</hi> The other invented by the Honourable Mr. <hi>Boyle;</hi> which He calls the <hi>Aerial Noctiluca;</hi> and whereof He hath lately published an excellent <hi>Discourse.</hi> In whose <hi>Laboratory,</hi> the solid kind was also made by his direction, several ways.</p>
                        <p>Of the Process for This here, Dr. <hi>Slare</hi> some years since received a hint from Dr. <hi>Christian Connerding, Archiater</hi> to the Duke of <hi>Zell.</hi> And not hearing of any one, amongst many that have try'd, besides these Three, to have suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in the making of it, he hath imparted the following Account.</p>
                        <p>Take good firm <hi>Chalk,</hi> ignite it in a <hi>Crucible,</hi> and then powder it. Put into a pint or half a pint of strong <hi>Spirit of Nitre, Cochleatim,</hi> as much hereof, as will serve well to sati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate it, <hi>i. e.</hi> till it becomes sweetish, and makes no <hi>Effervescence</hi> upon the injection of the <hi>Chalk.</hi> Then dilute this Liquor with fair Water, filtre it through a Paper, and so evaporate it in a large Glass, or glazed Vessel, or good <hi>Hassian Crucible</hi> to a dry <hi>Salt.</hi> The preparation whereof may be perform'd in four hours: whereas I have seen a Pocess, that would take as many Weeks to follow it.</p>
                        <p>The main business lies in the good <hi>Enchiresis;</hi> about which these several Directions must be carefully ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd.</p>
                        <p>First you must prepare a Vessel of Clay, somewhat like a shallow <hi>Coffee-Dish,</hi> of three, four, or five inches in Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metre, and an inch in depth, very well baked and neal'd. Then place it under a Muffle, after the manner of a Refining Furnace, in the place where the Cuppels usually stand: and so make it red hot. Then put the prepared <hi>Salt</hi> into it, by little and little, not above <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>j ss. or <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>ij at a time. Keep the fire to that degree, which will suffice to make the <hi>Salt</hi> boil in the Dish, so as to spread it self every way, and creep up the sides of it. Before the <hi>Salt,</hi> last put in, be consumed, be sure always to be ready, to make a new addition, otherwise your labour so far is lost, and you must begin again.
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:47321:184"/>
When five or six Drachms are fum'd away, take the Dish nimbly out of the fire, so soon as the <hi>Salt</hi> last put in is dry. If you have wrought well, what remains in the Dish will be yellowish in some parts, and every yellow part will shine. Secure this Matter from the Air by fitting and cementing a Glass to it: otherwise it will loose its property in one Week.</p>
                        <p>As to the Cause of this strange <hi>Phaenomenon,</hi> Dr. <hi>Slare</hi> continues to this effect. I shall in short offer my Thoughts, and refer them to your Judgment. Two Questions may arise: What it is in this Mixture that yields the light? and, How it doth it? As to the first, I take it to be the pure fiery part of the <hi>Spirit of Nitre</hi> embraced by the <hi>Chalk.</hi> For that the rest is weak and phlegmatick; as appears, if it be distill'd. Also, that about the end of the Operation, a black Fume begins to rise and fly away. That if by continuing the Dish too long in the fire, you drive all the Nitrous parts away, the <hi>Chalk</hi> which stays behind will not be luminous. Or if the Matter duly prepar'd, be exposed to the Air, and thereby prey'd upon, the same effect will follow.</p>
                        <p>As to the Second, I suppose, That it shines not by Imbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of Light, but by Impression from it, from whence proceeds a motion therein productive of Light. Which we may the rather be induced to believe, In that if it be put into an Iron Cover, and then an Iron Box, and a good heat given to it, it will shine so vigorously as to seem to kindle the Air about it. That two Men by following their blow close, will make a Bar of Iron glow, or shine in the dark. And although the Impulse of Light may seem small; yet upon Bodies nearly related to it, as This seems to be, it appears to be great. As in those odd effects it sometimes hath upon Infants unus'd to it; and People that have sore Eyes; or have been newly Couch'd; as it happen'd to Dr. <hi>Castle</hi> sometime since, who by making bold with his Eyes too early, (<hi>i. e.</hi> by a too frequent admission of light to them,) after that Operation, did thereupon suffer such extreme pains, and mischief in his Eyes, that he now dispairs of ever seeing more.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>Haac</hi> 
                           <note n="a" place="margin">Author of the <hi>Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment upon the Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone,</hi> Part 3.</note> saith he, hath frequently repeated the following Experiment upon this <hi>Phosphorus.</hi> If it be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to the Morning Light a little before Sun rising, it
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:47321:185"/>
presents a bright Rosy hugh. As the Sun approaches the <hi>Meridian,</hi> it advances to a higher and more firey Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, like that of a red hot Iron. A little after Sun-set, declines to a pale wan colour, like <hi>Chalk,</hi> or rather <hi>Mother of Pearl.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Expos'd, saith he, to the light of a Candle, or flaming Fagot, it receives a pale Luminous colour, as from the Sun towards setting. But being expos'd for a considerable time to the most clear Moonshine that I have seen in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> I could not perceive it to become Luminous in the least.</p>
                        <p>It hath been kept, saith he, in the <hi>Vacuum</hi> of my Great and Noble Patron, the Honourable Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> called <hi>Vacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um Boyleanum,</hi> and by his Highness Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> and Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self observ'd, for above four or five months, without any diminution of its shining property.</p>
                        <p>He adds, That he hath lately found a way to affix this Shining Matter to Glass, whereby some not unpleasing Experiments may be made. Thus far Dr. <hi>Slare.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>As to his Ingenious Conjectures of the Subject and Cause of Light in this <hi>Phosphorus:</hi> because he hath desired my Opinion, I shall therefore subjoyn it in a few lines.</p>
                        <p>As to the first, What it is which gives the Light: It seems hard to say, Whether it be the <hi>Cretaceous Salt,</hi> the <hi>Nitrous Salt,</hi> or some <hi>Igneous Particles</hi> incorporated with them in the Operation? It is plain, That one way or other, they do all concur to produce it.</p>
                        <p>As to the Question, How these <hi>Particles</hi> give light? It should first be stated, What Light is; Whether it be a Body? Which, though much disputed, yet in strict speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is an absurd Question; all one, as to ask, Whether a Quality, be a Body? But the meaning of the Question is, or ought to be, Whether there be any Body in Nature, which is the peculiar subject of Light, or metonymically may be called Light? Or whether more Bodies than one, may successively be the immediate subject thereof? If so, Whether it be any other Adjunct besides Motion? If only Motion, Whether as there is one peculiar Motion, at least for a Musical sound, so another for Light? And in regard there are some Experiments which seem to favour each of these Questions: such an Answer should be given as will
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:47321:185"/>
correspond with all those experiments; and will be too long to suit with this Catalogue.</p>
                        <p>I shall here only say, I am inclined to believe, That, in this Case, all the three Bodies above mention'd serve toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to compose an Apt Recipient of that which is the true Luminous Body. That, as in the mixture of <hi>Sulphur</hi> and <hi>Water,</hi> sulphurious <hi>Salts,</hi> of affinity with both, are used as a medium: so here, the Cretaceous Parts serve to fix the Nitrous; and the Nitrous, to fix the Igneous; being of a middle nature and readily incorporated with them both. And being in this union exposed to the Sun Beams, or other Light, the Igneous parts serve, for some time, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a certain portion of such as are Luminous, or to give, as I may say, a degree of Fixation to These also: and that therefore this Mixture is kindled or made to shine, by puting it into the Light, as a stick is made to burn, by puting it into the fire.</p>

                           <p>The advantage of one with more Glasses, is that it takes in a bigger Object, or a greater part of it. Of one with a single Glass, that it shews the Object clearer. So that to have a distinct representation of it, 'tis convenient to make use of both. Of the latter kind, I have seen several made by Mr. <hi>John Malling</hi> in this City, not only with melted, but with Ground-Glasses so very small, that one of these Ground-Glasses being weighed in the <hi>Assay-Scales</hi> in the <hi>Tower,</hi> was found not above the fourscorth part of a Grain.

                              <hi>See his Book</hi> De Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu, Cap. 6. Prop. 10. Fig. 243.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>I did first, saith the Doctor, Contrive and Delineate It in the Year, 1644. at <hi>Queens-Colledge</hi> in <hi>Cambridge.</hi> When afterwards I was made Professor of <hi>Geometry</hi> at <hi>Oxford,</hi> about the Year, 1650. I caused it to be framed of small pieces of <hi>Wood,</hi> representing so many pieces of <hi>Timber;</hi> prepar'd by Mr. <hi>Rainsford</hi> a <hi>Joyner</hi> in <hi>Oxford,</hi> and put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by my self.</p>
                        <p>This I shewed soon after to divers in <hi>Oxford,</hi> and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to Dr. <hi>Wilkins,</hi> then <hi>Warden</hi> of <hi>Wadham-Colledge</hi> in <hi>Oxford.</hi> Who was so well pleased with it, that he caused another to be made for himself, according to that Pattern. Which he kept by him for many years, and afterwards pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to the <hi>Royal Society.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>After the King's <hi>Restauration,</hi> I caus'd another to be made; and, in the Year, 1660. presented it to his Majesty; who was well pleas'd with it, and caused it to be reposited in his Closet.</p>
                        <p>On the Model first mention'd, I Read two Publique <hi>Lectures</hi> at <hi>Oxford,</hi> on the <hi>Vespers</hi> of the <hi>Publique Act:</hi> the one, in the Year, 1652. as to the Construction of it; the other, in the Year, 1653. as to the computation of what weight every Joynt of it sustains; whereby it might be the better judged how far it may be safely practised. The greatest weight charged on any one Joynt, doth not amount to Ten-times the weight of one Beam: And the greatest weight bor'n by any one Beam; not to seventeen times its own weight: and even this, not laid all on the same part, but distributed to several parts of it. The sum of these two <hi>Lectures,</hi> is to be seen in the Sixth Chapter of my Book <hi>de Motu.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="362" facs="tcp:47321:188"/>A Third <hi>Lecture,</hi> much to the same purpose, I read, <hi>May,</hi> 1699. in the same place, before the present Grand Duke of <hi>Tuscany,</hi> who honoured the University with a Visit, and me with his Presence at that <hi>Lecture.</hi> After which, he was pleased very particularly to consider both the Delineation and Model, and declared himself very well pleased with it,</p>
                        <p>The contrivance is obvious to the Eye. The outsides re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present the Walls of the Building on which this Flat Floor or Roof is to be laid. The Beams next adjoyning to the sides, have one end lodged on those Walls; the other end sustained by another Beam, lying cross; both ends of which, are in like manner sustained by other cross Beams; and those again by others; till they reach the other Walls. So that no one of them can fall, unless the Walls fail, or the Beams break: all mutually sustaining each other without any Pillar or Prop to support them, besides the outer Walls.</p>
                        <p>The Models I caused to be made, and that of the <hi>Royal Society</hi> in imitation thereof, are in Breadth, about four times as much as the Length of the longest Beam. But may be continu'd, at pleasure, to farther breadth, as shall be thought fit. With this Caution: That the farther the Work is continu'd, the greater Weight will be charged on every Joynt; especially near the middle. And though in this Model, no one Beam is charged with so much as seventeen times its own weight: yet if the Work be continu'd to a greater breadth, the proportional Weight will be thereby increased. And therefore must be limited, according to the strength of Timber, able to bear more or fewer times its own weight.</p>
                        <p>I do not know, that yet it hath been reduced to practise, in more than four Pieces, in this Form. Such is one of the Floors in the <hi>Tower</hi> of the Publique Schools at <hi>Oxford:</hi> the Breadth whereof, to the Length of the Beams, is as three to two. But may doubtless be continu'd much further: especially in such a Roof or Floor, as is not to bear much more than its own weight.</p>
                        <figure/>
                        <p>Thus, for instance, a <hi>Bowling-Green</hi> of near an Acre of Ground, may be cover'd with a Frame of long slender
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:47321:188"/>
pieces, without any other Prop than on the sides, for <hi>Vines,</hi> or other like <hi>Plants</hi> to run upon, so as to shade the whole.</p>
                        <p>Note here, That whereas the ends of the several pieces are to lie upon those that cross them, about the middle thereof; it will be necessary at every Joynt to abate both pieces half way, or near it; that one may be thus let into the other, and the whole reduced to a Flat. But whether such piece, so abated doth end even with that on which it lies, or doth lie over somewhat beyond it; is indifferent. And though That may seem more elegant; This, perhaps, may be fitter for use.</p>
                        <p>Each piece, I say, must be so abated half way, or near it. For, whereas those Beams, especially if of a considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble length, will, with the weight, bow a little; if this abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be somewhat less than half way, (whereby without such bowing, the whole would somewhat rise in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle) it will by such bowing be reduced to a Flat.</p>
                        <p>Note also, That a Frame thus contriv'd, needs neither <hi>Nail</hi> nor <hi>Pin;</hi> the several pieces fastening, as well as support<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one another. Yet, if it be to bear a great weight more than its own; it will be convenient to fasten each Joynt with <hi>Pins;</hi> and, if need be, to strengthen it with <hi>Iron-Plates,</hi> or line it with other pieces of <hi>Timber,</hi> to be fasten'd with <hi>Iron-Bolts;</hi> to make amends for what is weaken'd by the abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments at the <hi>Joynts:</hi> which will make the whole Frame exceeding strong.</p>

                        <p>A CANOO. Given by Mr. <hi>Hocknel.</hi> A sort of Boat so called, used in <hi>Greenland,</hi> and some other places. Figur'd almost like a <hi>Weavers Shuttle.</hi> The Wooden-Work is made up of five slender pieces, running by the length: one, which is round at the bottom or in the place of the <hi>Keel;</hi> and two flat ones in each side: Made steady with
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:47321:189"/>
small bended pieces, set or pricked in cross-ways, instead of <hi>Ribs:</hi> and so ty'd all together with <hi>Fin-Whale-Bone.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This Wooden-Work is cover'd all over, both below and above, with <hi>Seal-Skins,</hi> sewed together with <hi>Leathern-Thongs.</hi> Saving, that towards the middle, is an Oval Hole, encompassed with a <hi>Rim</hi> about four inches high, big enough for a man to sit down in.</p>
                        <p>In length, seventeen feet. From the Centre of the said <hi>Hole</hi> or <hi>Seat,</hi> forward, Ten feet; from thence, backward, seven. In breadth at the <hi>Seat,</hi> a foot and ¾. In depth, backward, seven inches and ½; forward, a foot; because of the mans feet. And the Boat seems thereby to be carried forward with the more ease: as a Coach, in being hung higher behind. The whole Boat is answerable to a great Bladder, in which, though the Waves dash and beat over it never so much, the man still sits safe.</p>
                        <p>He makes use but of one <hi>Oare,</hi> about nine feet long. Made of <hi>Ash,</hi> and shaped somewhat answerable to a strong <hi>Bow.</hi> In the middle, an inch and ¼ thick, and an inch and ¾ broad, by the <hi>Horizontal</hi> measure: towards both ends, about ¼ of an inch thick, and two inches and ½ broad, by the <hi>Vertical.</hi> At each end is fasten'd a <hi>Padle,</hi> here wanting. This <hi>Oare</hi> he holds in the middle, and Rowing with both ends alternately, makes it serve instead of two.</p>

At the Breech, where the two Barrels are open one into the other, is placed a <hi>Valve,</hi> to admit the Air into the outer Barrel, as the Rod drives it, and to keep it there.</p>
                        <p>A Seven-SHOT GUN, or a <hi>Gun</hi> which carries Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Bullets, for seven Charges and Discharges to be made presently one after another. Given by <hi>Dudly Palmer</hi>

                        <p>The meanest is in SINGLE STRINGS. Of which, here is both the White and Black. By measure, the former goes at Five shillings the Fathome; the latter, at Ten. By Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, the former at Six a penny; the latter, at Three.</p>
                        <p>The next in value is that which is Woven together into BRACELETS about ¾ of a yard long; Black and White, in Stripes, and six pieces in a Row; the <hi>Warp</hi> consisting of <hi>Leathern Thongs,</hi> the <hi>Woofe</hi> of <hi>Thread.</hi> These <hi>Bracelets</hi> the <hi>Zanksquaes</hi> or <hi>Gentlewomen</hi> commonly wear twice or thrice about their <hi>Wrists.</hi>

                        <p>The best, is woven into GIRDLES. Of This here are two sorts.

The other, not all-out so long, but with fifteen pieces in a Row. Woven into black <hi>Rhombs</hi> or <hi>Diamond-Squares,</hi> and <hi>Crosses</hi> within them. The spaces between filled up with white. These two last, are sometimes worn as their richest Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; but chiefly used in great Payments, esteemed their Noblest Presents, and laid up as their Treasure.</p>

                        <p>The Draughts of several <hi>Indian</hi> PLANTS on a Table. In the first place, of</p>

                        <p>The NUTMEG-TREE: Together with a Branch of the same after the <hi>life:</hi> The Fruit of the <hi>Female-Nutmeg:</hi> Of that called the <hi>Thieving-Nutmeg,</hi> because it infects and spoils the good ones where it lies: The <hi>Male,</hi> with its Fruit, both long and short: And the little Kind, wherewith the Natives dey their Teeth black. Next of</p>
                        <p>A PLANT which beareth a Fruit hanging with a long
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:47321:195"/>
Stalk upon the top of the Leafe; almost in the shape of a <hi>Can,</hi> with its Lid. If it be open'd, though the Weather ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so hot, 'tis half full of Liquor. Then of</p>
                        <p>A SAGEWAR-TREE; whose <hi>Flower</hi> being cut, renders a Juyce like <hi>Wine,</hi> far above the <hi>Coco-Tree:</hi> With the Fruit both of the <hi>Male</hi> and <hi>Female.</hi> In the last place, of</p>
                        <p>The SAGOUS-TREE; which those that inhabit the <hi>Molucca</hi> Islands, eat instead of Bread: With the Fruit, after the <hi>life.</hi>

                        <p>Another Variety of the ARABICK Letter, not properly <hi>Written,</hi> but <hi>Impress'd</hi> with a Style, or as it were Engraven, upon two double <hi>Plates</hi> of the <hi>Palmetto-Leaf.</hi>

                           <hi>Sculpture.</hi> A CARVED Shell of MOTHER of <hi>Pearl.</hi> On which <hi>Andromeda</hi> stands naked upon the Shore, having her Arms fasten'd to a Rock with two Chains. Near the Shore, a great <hi>Sea-Fish</hi> or <hi>Monster</hi> making towards her, and spouting out Water at <hi>Perseus.</hi> Who comes flying upon <hi>Pegasus,</hi> with his Shield, and his Sword advanced, to kill the <hi>Monster.</hi> Upon a <hi>Promontory</hi> between <hi>Andromeda</hi> and <hi>Perseus</hi> stands a <hi>Cupid,</hi> and among the Trees upon it another, signifying their Marriage afterwards. All done with extraordinary Art.</p>
                        <p>ANOTHER, with the same curious Work, but different Phancy. <hi>Neptune</hi> making towards the Shore, without his Mace, advances and spreads abroad his Arms, in Courtship towards <hi>Diana.</hi> Who stands on the Shore in her Mantle half naked, and holding forth her Hand in the posture of denial. Between them, two naked <hi>Nymphs,</hi> one giving aim to the other, shooting a Dart at <hi>Neptune</hi> to give him a further repulse. And a <hi>Cupid</hi> flying away over <hi>Dianas</hi> Head.</p>
                        <p>About 36 pieces of <hi>Ivory,</hi> with IMAGES CARVED upon Each. On some, of Men; on others of Women and Children; and on others, of Cattel. One of them, a <hi>Crucifix,</hi> with the Eleven Apostles. They seem to have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to a <hi>Cabinet</hi> or <hi>Chest of Drawers,</hi> and to make some story; but the rest being wanting, unintelligible.</p>
                        <p>One of them, is a curious piece of Work. On the top of a Rock, stands a Castle. At the foot, a <hi>George</hi> or <hi>Chevaleer,</hi> armed and mounted, and combating a <hi>Dragon;</hi> defending her self, and shewing her rage in a most lively posture. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the Horse stands one of her young Ones, expecting her Conquest. On the brow of the Rock, a Woman, or if you will the Lady, praying for her overthrow. Hereto may be refer'd,</p>
                        <p>A SEA-PIECE, consisting wholly of INLAY'D-WORK, of several Colours, in <hi>Stone.</hi> As also,</p>

                           <abbr>Esq</abbr>. A solid Triangle, turn'd open on the four sides. With a <hi>Flower</hi> standing out on each side, and loose. In each <hi>Flower,</hi> a little Spike, also loose. But all the four <hi>Flowers</hi> by themselves, and so the Spikes, are united in the centre. On the Necks of the <hi>Flowers</hi> likewise hangs a Sphaerical Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angle; and on each Neck, several small Rings. Preserved in a Round <hi>Ivory Box.</hi>

                        <p>The HEAD of a Princes, in her HAIR, and with a CORONET; in an Oval of <hi>Ivory.</hi> That which is extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary, is, That it is not CARVED, but all TURNED Work. 'Tis kept in an Oval <hi>Box,</hi> wrought with Undulated Work of several Forms, all likewise Turn'd. The Art, I think, is now dead with the Author.</p>

                           <hi>Molded-Work.</hi> Two HALF BODIES in Armor, betwixt four and five inches in length.

                  <head>Appendix.</head>
                  <head type="sub">Of some Particulars lately given by Dr. <hi>Christopher Merret.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>TO which I shall only premise a Note concerning the CLYSTER-BAG, described <hi>p.</hi> 239. of this <hi>Catalogue;</hi> but should have been placed in the last Part. 'Twas given by Sir <hi>Rob. Southwell;</hi> of whom I lately learn, That the <hi>Portugal Negros,</hi> having rowled a lump of Clay into the shape mention'd <hi>p.</hi> 239. they cut the Branches of a certain Tree which yields an Oily <hi>Gum,</hi> and so turn the Clay round, as the <hi>Gum</hi> drops upon it, till it hath cover'd it all over like a thick Skin; which being dry'd in the Sun, will be almost as tough as <hi>Leather.</hi> Then picking out the Clay, it serves them for a <hi>Bladder.</hi> To which they tie the Shank of a <hi>Hare</hi> for a Pipe: and so filling it with Sea-water, as often as they feel themselves much chafed with heat, put it up for a <hi>Glyster.</hi> These Bags they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly hang by their sides, to be always ready for their use.</p>
                  <p>The Particulars given by the Doctor are these that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; with the Descriptions, in his own words.</p>
                  <p>SAGU. A <hi>Gum,</hi> so called. It comes from the Islands of <hi>Malacca.</hi> It drops from the Trees in small roundish Grains, of the bigness of <hi>Turnep-seed,</hi> but whitish. Chewed, it tasteth somewhat clammy. Boil'd in water, exactly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents <hi>Frog-Sperm;</hi> and in consistence, comes nearest to <hi>Gum Tragaganth.</hi> 'Tis used in <hi>Medicine</hi> and <hi>Diet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>TERRA JAPONICA. Call'd also <hi>Catechu, Categu,</hi> and <hi>Casheu.</hi> 'Tis a <hi>Gummo-Resina.</hi> For most of it will dissolve in Water; and some parts of it only in <hi>Rect. Spirit of Wine.</hi> Most of it contains a great deal of Earth; the reason of the Name. 'Tis cover'd with a rough brown Coat; within which it comes near the colour of <hi>Aloe;</hi> but darker, and
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:47321:200"/>
with brown earthy Particles intermix'd. The Tast Astrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and very Dry. The Tincture of a bright Claret colour. An useful and effectual Medicine; and not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful.</p>
                  <p>POCO SEMPIE. A Golden Moss, consisting of most fine, soft and flexible Threads. Accounted a great Cordial. And said wholly to dissolve in the Mouth; and seem'd so to me, in barely chewing it: but the contrary upon Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment, which was thus: I ty'd some of it in a Cloath, and chew'd it; keeping it in my mouth a whole Night: but in the Morning, I found no diminution, nor alteration. So that chewing only unfolds it, and then 'tis insensibly swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd with the Spittle.</p>
                  <p>RIZAGON. A Root brought from <hi>Bengala,</hi> of good use. Cut into flat pieces, of a whitish colour, bitterish and aromatick Tast; and hath very large <hi>Fibers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>CAROLINA. A long red Root, so call'd, from the Place from whence it comes. It draws on Paper red Lines. Answers not expectation, as to deying.</p>
                  <p>SADORE, or Bitter Wood. It hath a brownish Barque: the Wood yellowish, and exceeding bitter. If it be sliced long ways, you will find very white <hi>Fibers</hi> running by the length.</p>
                  <p>CAIUMANIS <hi>Olearij.</hi> 
                     <note n="a" place="margin">P. 2. p. 356.</note> By the <hi>Sea-men, Caiomanes.</hi> By the <hi>Portugese, Canella de Mato. An Canella Crassiori Cortice.</hi> 
                     <note n="b" place="margin">Pinax, 409. b.</note> This Barque above ¼ of an inch thick. Distill'd, it affords a somewhat harsh and rough Liquor. But by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion, makes an <hi>Aromatick</hi> and grateful syrup.</p>
                  <p>SALT of <hi>Soap-Lees.</hi> An <hi>Exotick.</hi> Found in some quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities on the sides of the <hi>Boylers.</hi> I have yet made no trials of it.</p>
                  <p>TEUTENAGE. A sort of <hi>Speltar,</hi> as many Experiments shew. Hereof <hi>Parallellepipedon</hi> Vessels are made in <hi>Japan,</hi> wherein their <hi>Thea</hi> is brought over.</p>
                  <p>I have several other <hi>Rarities,</hi> which, when I see what is wanting in the <hi>Societie's Musaeum,</hi> I shall add to it.</p>
                  <p>Most of these Things were communicated by Mr. <hi>Samuel Clark,</hi> learned, judicious, experienced in all things Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and Artificial which are brought to the King's <hi>Ware<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house</hi> in the Port of <hi>London,</hi> whereof he is <hi>Surveyor.</hi>

                        <p>The <hi>Gulet</hi> of a <hi>Weesle</hi> (which from the Ears to the set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on of the Tail was 10 inches) about five inches long, ¼ in Diametre, equally wide, and thin. Enters the Stomach at the left End.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Stomach</hi> about three inches long; proportionably, more than a <hi>Dogs.</hi> An inch in Diametre at the upper Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; at the nether, ¼; having a <hi>flexure</hi> towards its Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with the Guts: shaped like to the body of a pair of <hi>Bag-Pipes.</hi> Thin, and plain, or without Folds. Which seems to be the property of the Stomachs of most Rapaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Quadrupeds.</hi>

                        <p>The Guts <hi>thin,</hi> and plain, or with little store of <hi>Glands,</hi> especially of such as in most <hi>Carnivorous</hi> Animals are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous. About a yard in length, and 1/<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>At the <hi>Anus,</hi> a Couple of <hi>Bags</hi> grow to the Gut; one

on each side. Each of them, fill'd, about the bigness of a large <hi>Garden-Peas:</hi> containing a yellow, and thickish Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, extraordinary <hi>foetid,</hi> and having the peculiar scent of the Animal in the most intense degree. Over the <hi>Bags</hi> or <hi>Bladders,</hi> is spread the <hi>Sphincter-Muscle;</hi> which compressing <hi>Them</hi> and the <hi>Anus</hi> both together, forceth them to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary evacution.</p>
                        <p>I have not yet dissected the <hi>Civet-Cat,</hi> but suppose, that these Bags are analogous to those that contain the <hi>Civet</hi> in that Animal.</p>
                        <p>These Bags, so far as I have observ'd, are proper to all <hi>Carnivorous Quadrupeds,</hi> and those only: as will further appear by the following Examples.</p>

                        <p>This Gut runs into the <hi>Colon,</hi> which is above a foot long, where widest or next the <hi>Caecum,</hi> an inch over; at the other end ½ an inch.

                        <p>In opening this Animal, being just dead, the <hi>Peristaltick</hi> motion of the Guts, was very apparent, especially in this Gut. By means whereof, the several Cells aforesaid, were made reciprocally to move in and out; so as while one moved and was convex inward, another next adjacent, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and was convex outward; and so on by a kind of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulation, for several inches together.</p>
                        <p>This Gut is very thick and Glandulous all over, the Glands standing every where close and contiguous: so that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side of the Gut, looks like the <hi>Seal-Fishes</hi> Skin. The Glands are not flat, as in the Guts above describ'd, but standing up round and high, like an infinite number of <hi>Papillae:</hi> the Mouths of each visibly open; from whence a <hi>Muçus</hi> may easily be express'd.</p>

Which though it be wider by far, than the same Gut in any other <hi>Quadruped</hi> that I have open'd: yet in respect to the Amplitude of the other Guts in this Animal, it may properly be called the <hi>Small Gut.</hi> It hath six or eight Contractions or short narrow Necks; and amongst them, a long one, about a foot before its en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into the <hi>Caecum.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It hath very few, and but small Clusters of those larger Glands, observable in the fore-mention'd Animals. But of a smaller kind, the inner Coat is every where full as it can hold, each Gland not so big as a <hi>Cheese-Mite.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Second, or <hi>Caecum,</hi> is square; having not two, but four Ligaments which contain it in that figure. By means whereof the sides are also gather'd into many Cells, small and great, as the <hi>Colon</hi> it self in this and other Animals.</p>
                        <p>The Bulk is vast: Near the Cone, or close end, about three inches over. But at the Base, or where it joyns to the

                           <hi>Colon,</hi> a ¼ of a yard over. And in length, a full yard. So that it is more than twice as big as the Stomach.</p>
                        <p>The Learned Dr. <hi>Glisson,</hi> in speaking of the Stomachs of <hi>Quadrupeds,</hi> saith, That a <hi>Rabbit</hi> and a <hi>Horse</hi> have a double <hi>Caecum.</hi> His words are these; <hi>In Equis, Cuniculis, &amp; Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellis Indicis, Caecum duplex deprehenditur.</hi> But herein he is mistaken. As to a <hi>Rabbit,</hi> the contrary hath been seen in the Guts presented entire before this Honourable Presence. And who ever will take the pains to examine all the Guts of a <hi>Horse,</hi> will find, That neither hath he, any more than One <hi>Caecum,</hi> which I have above describ'd.</p>
                        <p>The Third Gut, is the <hi>Colon.</hi> The unusual shape, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious Amplitude whereof, might give occasion to the Doctor to mistake it for another <hi>Caecum.</hi> So that although a <hi>Horse</hi> hath but one single <hi>Caecum;</hi> yet may he not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be said to have a Treble <hi>Colon; sc.</hi> Two Ample ones, next the <hi>Caecum;</hi> and a smaller one next the <hi>Rectum.</hi> Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less any please rather to call the two Great ones, the two <hi>BELLIES</hi> of one and the same <hi>Colon.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The First <hi>Belly</hi> next the <hi>Caecum,</hi> is no less where widest, than ¼ of a yard over; and in length, above a yard and 1/<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>The Second Belly, next the <hi>Rectum,</hi> as wide as the former; and above a yard long. So that each of these Bellies are bigger than the <hi>Caecum.</hi> That next the <hi>Caecum</hi> half as big again: And about four times as big as the Stomach.</p>
                        <p>These two Bellies are joyn'd together by a <hi>Neck,</hi> about four inches over, and ¼ of a yard long. Gather'd likewise into Cells, as all the other parts of the <hi>Colon.</hi> But with four Ligaments, as the <hi>Caecum.</hi> By which also they lie square. And upon a passing view, might be another occasion of the forementioned mistake. So that if any one shall call either of these <hi>Bellies,</hi> a <hi>Caecum;</hi> then a <hi>Horse</hi> will not have two only, but three <hi>Caecums.</hi> But these <hi>Bellies</hi> have neither of them, the defining property of a <hi>Caecum;</hi> which is, To be pervious at one end only.</p>
                        <p>The small <hi>Colon,</hi> or the smaller part of it, runs betwixt the Second Belly and the <hi>Rectum:</hi> likewise full of Cells, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd together by two opposite Ligaments as in other Animals. 'Tis about three inches over; and six yards long.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Rectum,</hi> very thick and Muscular, as in most other

large <hi>Quadrupeds;</hi> about three inches and ½ over, and not above ½ a yard long. The length of all the Guts (without the <hi>Caecum</hi>) is about 37 yards. So that the Guts of a Horse, although they come much short of those of the Animals next mention'd: yet in wideness, much exceed them: So as to contain about ten times more than his Stomach.</p>

                        <p>Against the <hi>Pylorus</hi> stands a round Caruncle, as big as a small <hi>Filbert Kernel,</hi> like a stopple to the <hi>Pylorus.</hi> A part I think peculiar to this Animal.</p>
                        <p>This <hi>Ventricle</hi> within, hath several Folds, about ⅙<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of an inch broad, and as deep; and wind to and and fro, as in a <hi>Rabbit</hi> or a Man. Scituate only about the right End or half of the Belly: the other End being, though also Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, yet very plain.</p>
                        <p>At the left End of this greater <hi>Ventricle,</hi> another far less, yet distinct one, is appendent. Much after the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as the <hi>Reticulum</hi> in a <hi>Sheep</hi> is to the <hi>Panch.</hi> Or as the <hi>Intestinum Caecum</hi> to the other Guts: for which reason it may be called <hi>Caecus Ventriculus.</hi> Separated from the greater by a Muscular Ligament, like a half <hi>Valve.</hi> Where it joyns to it, an inch and ½ over, and thence extended two inches in length; ending in a twisted or hooked <hi>Cone.</hi> Not so Muscular, as the greater <hi>Venter,</hi> but thin and Membra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous. The inner surface also plain, or without Folds. Yet is it Glandulous, as the other: but the <hi>Mucus</hi> the Glands yield somewhat thiner.</p>
                        <p>The Guts of this <hi>Pig</hi> (so young) were near fourteen

                     <div type="section">
                        <head>A Sheep.</head>
                        <p>THe <hi>Gulet</hi> of a SHEEP (three years old, and weighing 120 pounds <hi>Haverdupoise</hi>) about an inch and ¼ over: which with respect to the <hi>Panch</hi> is but small. Composed of several Organical Parts: which because they are here, as well as in some other larger Animals, more conspicuous, I shall somewhat more particularly describe them.</p>
                        <p>They are all of them, by <hi>Anatomists,</hi> usually, but impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly called <hi>Coats:</hi> for the inermost, are the chief Body of the <hi>Gulet:</hi> So that 'tis the same, as to call the Wood of a hollow Plant, one of its Coats. 'Tis therefore composed of Five Membranes; Three in the middle, lined with a Fourth, and faced with a Fifth.</p>
                        <p>The Utmost, and the Inmost, are both Cuticular. The Inmost, or <hi>Glandulata,</hi> exceeding white, and very fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able: answerable to the outward Rind of the Root of a Plant.</p>
                        <p>The next to it, is the Nervous. Which here, and in some other Voraceous Animals, is so very thick, that it may more properly be called the <hi>CORPUS NERVOSVM.</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed of <hi>Fibers,</hi> partly running by the length of the <hi>Gulet,</hi> and in part <hi>tranversly</hi> to the two Muscular Membranes.
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:47321:211"/>
Throughout the length of it, run many small Nerves, like the finest <hi>Lawn-Thread.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This <hi>Corpus Nervosum,</hi> is, as I conceive the <hi>TENDON</hi> to the two next or Muscular Membranes.</p>
                        <p>These Two (they are at least two) are truly Muscular. <hi>Stenon</hi> hath observed them to be spirally continu'd: which of some of them is true, not of all. And Dr. <hi>Willis</hi> saith also truly, That they <hi>Decussate,</hi> the one winding from the right hand downwards, the other from the left. But, to proceed where these two accurate Persons have left; of the admirable Texture of these two Muscules, it is further ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servable, That of each parcel of <hi>Fibers,</hi> one half is so distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted, as those <hi>Fibers</hi> which belong to the uppermost Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule on the right hand, are in their progress towards the left, cast into that which lies underneath. And so on the contrary, those which belong to the Upmost on the left hand, are cast, into that which lies underneath on the right: both together making a perfect Plat, somewhat like to that in a <hi>Riding-Whip.</hi> The other half keeps always above, and is continu'd by a compounded line, partly <hi>Spiral,</hi> and partly <hi>Elliptick;</hi> especially towards and at the bottom of the <hi>Gula.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Stomachs or Venters in a <hi>Sheep</hi> are Four. The First, or <hi>Panch,</hi> consisteth of as many Membranes as the <hi>Gulet.</hi> The Inmost and the next, <hi>sc.</hi> the Nervous, are raised up, and made all over rough with a multitude of small Ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous and pointed Knots, in some places smaller and round; in other larger and flat: all very like those upon the Tongue.</p>
                        <p>In the <hi>Panch</hi> also are several <hi>Gibbosities,</hi> caused chiefly by the doublings and thickness of the Muscular Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes, in those places. So that they are as it were the <hi>Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons</hi> of the said Membranes.</p>
                        <p>The Second <hi>Venter,</hi> is by the <hi>Latins</hi> called <hi>Recticulum.</hi> In which are the like Nervous Knots, as in the <hi>Panch,</hi> but smaller. And comprehended within several round Ridges or Plates composed together in the form of a <hi>Net</hi> or <hi>Honey-Coome.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Third, is called the <hi>Omasus:</hi> by <hi>Butchers</hi> the <hi>Feck.</hi> Of a wonderful structure: being divided into above 40 Receptacles by so many Sepiments, great and small:
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:47321:212"/>
some ¼, ½, or ¼ of an inch, others an inch, or two inches broad. All cover'd with the like Knots, as the two former <hi>Venters;</hi> but extream small.</p>
                        <p>The Fourth <hi>Venter</hi> is called <hi>Abomasus:</hi> by <hi>Butchers,</hi> the <hi>Read.</hi> The only analogous one to that in a Man; the Membranes hereof being all alike. Saving, That the Plates (as here they are rather than Folds) are far deeper; and oppositely and regularly mett in an oblique posture.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Guts</hi> are Six or Eight. The length of all, near 32 yards. The First, or <hi>Serpentine,</hi> from its Flexures, about ½ a yard long, and ¾ of an inch over.</p>
                        <p>The Second, or <hi>Jejunum,</hi> about 13 yards and ½, and as wide as the first.</p>
                        <p>The Third, or <hi>Ileum,</hi> 11 yards long; and an inch over.</p>
                        <p>The Fourth, or <hi>Caecum,</hi> above a Foot in length; and where widest, two inches and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>The Fifth, is continu'd from the <hi>Caecum</hi> without either Valve or Contraction intervening. Above a yard long; and an inch and ¼ where narrowest.</p>
                        <p>The Last, may by way of Eminence, be called the <hi>Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular:</hi> being as thick as the <hi>Gulet</hi> it self. And This may be subdivided into Three. From the Fifth, it grows small to the length of an Eln; where it is ½ an inch over. Of this width it continues two Elns more and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>The Glands, not so observable, as in those of a <hi>Calf,</hi> which I shall next describe.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> Of the Uses of the Gulet and Stomachs of Quadrupeds.</head>
                     <div type="section">
                        <head>And first of the Gulet.</head>
                        <p>IN speaking hereof, I shall, as in the Anatomical Part, insist chiefly on those Particulars which have been omitted by others.</p>
                        <p>It may therefore first be noted of the bore of the <hi>Gulet,</hi> That it is not every where alike answerable to the Body or Stomach. As in a <hi>Fox,</hi> which both feeds on Bones, and swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows whole, or with little chewing; and next in a <hi>Dog,</hi> and other Ossivorous <hi>Quadrupeds,</hi> 'tis very large; <hi>sc.</hi> to prevent a contusion therein. Next in a <hi>Horse;</hi> which though he feeds on <hi>Grass,</hi> yet swallows much at once, and so requires a more open passage. But in a <hi>Sheep, Rabbit,</hi> or <hi>Ox,</hi> which bite short, and swallow less at once, 'tis smaller. But in a <hi>Squirel,</hi> still lesser, both because he eats fine, and to keep him from disgorging his meat upon his descending leaps. And so in <hi>Rats</hi> and <hi>Mice,</hi> which often run along Walls with their Heads downward.</p>
                        <p>The Thickness of the <hi>Gulet</hi> is also different. So in a <hi>Weesle</hi> or <hi>Pole-Cat,</hi> which eat no Bones, more Membranous or Skiny. In <hi>Dogs</hi> more Muscular, greater force being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to carry down Bones, than Flesh. But in <hi>Sheep, Hogs, Cows, Horses</hi> most of all; for three Reasons: First, For that <hi>Grass,</hi> and especially <hi>Hay</hi> is less slippery, and apt to clog by the way. Secondly, Because they eat continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, and so the Gulet is in continual action, which it could not bear without pain, were it not made sturdy for hard la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour: in like manner, as are the Muscules of the Chaps, and especially the <hi>Masseter,</hi> in all the said Animals. Thirdly, For that all they eat and drink (because they hold their Heads down) must be made by a greater force to <hi>ascend</hi> into their Stomachs. Whereas in Carnivorous Animals, and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially a Man, it passeth by descent. And there are few, but may remember, how difficult it was, when they were Boys, to drink with their Heads down at a Spring. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <hi>Dogs</hi> drink with their Heads down, yet they can
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:47321:213"/>
only <hi>Lap,</hi> their Gulet not being Muscular enough to <hi>carry up</hi> much at once.</p>
                        <p>The several Parts of the Gulet, have their distinct Uses. The outer Membrane, is both a Fence, and a Swath to all the rest; especially to the Muscular. For the Nervous un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath, being always capable of, and sometimes subject to inordinate expansions (as Dr. <hi>Willis</hi> doth well conjecture) it would Rack the Muscular Membranes beyond their Tone, were they not bound up within this.</p>
                        <p>The two Musculars, chiefly subserve the several Motions of the Gulet. Amongst which, Dr. <hi>Willis</hi> reckons Oscitation or Yauning, and Expuition. Of the first, <note n="a" place="margin">Phar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mac. Ration, P. 1.</note> his words are these; <hi>In Oscitatione, Oesophagi ductum ampliari, &amp; quasi a vento quodam inflari &amp; expandi sentimus.</hi> But who knows not, that the <hi>Windpipe,</hi> and not the <hi>Gulet,</hi> is the part con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in all kinds of Respiration, where of <hi>Oscitation</hi> is one. Of the latter, his words are these; <note n="b" place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                           <hi>Gulae Tunica carnosa, duplex quasi Musculus censeri debet; quorum alter, expuitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis opus persicit.</hi> At that time forgeting, that no man ever spat any thing out of his Stomach; no more than he can be said to vomit or eructate out of his Mouth. The Doctor is one, of whom I have learned much: and therefore I mention these Things, only because they lie in my way: and that we may still remember, <hi>Nullius in Verba.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Actions of the <hi>Gulet</hi> are therefore principally these Three, <hi>Deglutition, Vomition,</hi> and <hi>Eructation.</hi> By one of the Muscular Membranes, saith the forementioned Doctor, <hi>sc.</hi> that which descends, <hi>Deglutition</hi> is performed; by the ascendent, <hi>Vomition.</hi> His words <note n="c" place="margin">Ibid.</note> are these, <hi>Cùm unius Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brarum ordo descendens, Deglutitioni inserviat; alter ascendens, Vomitionis opus persicit.</hi> But that he was herein mistaken, I conceive, appears from the structure of the said Membranes, neither of which, is ascendent or descendent, more than the other; and from the manner of their Contexture, as is above describ'd. Besides, if it were so, why should there not be <hi>Ascendent</hi> and <hi>Descendent Fibers</hi> or <hi>Muscules,</hi> for the Natural, and the Inverted Motions also of the <hi>Guts?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I conceive therefore, That <hi>Deglutition</hi> and <hi>Vomition</hi> are made by the Cooperation of both the said Membranes: only in the former, the Motion goes from the Throat downward, in the latter, from the Stomach upward. And
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:47321:214"/>
so in <hi>Eructation,</hi> only with less force. For the performance of which Actions, Two Muscules or Muscular Membranes are yet requisite; and those platted and interchanged, as hath been describ'd: That is, by a double Plat of the <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi> of both; whereby half the nether Membrane on the one side the <hi>Gulet,</hi> becomes half the upper Membrane on the other side: and so <hi>vice versa,</hi> in spiral rounds through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out. To the end, That the <hi>Gulet</hi> being hereby contracted in one part, and dilated in the next, might at the same time, thrust forward, and let pass, any body therein contain'd: and that the said <hi>Contractions</hi> and <hi>Dilatations</hi> might be more easily and regularly made, and by reciprocal <hi>Undula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> carry'd on from one end of the <hi>Gulet</hi> to the other. These <hi>Undulations,</hi> in the <hi>Gulet</hi> of a <hi>Horse,</hi> when he drinks, are very plainly seen.</p>
                        <p>And that this <hi>Undulation</hi> may be made with more speed, it is observable, That the said <hi>Muscular Fibers</hi> are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd by a close, but very oblique or open spiral Line. Whereby, as the spiral Rounds or Circuits, so the <hi>Undula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> are the fewer; and consequently, not slowly (as in the <hi>Guts</hi>) but much sooner finished.</p>
                        <p>Hence it is, That a <hi>Cat</hi> hath so difficult a swallow, the meat commonly seeming to stick in her Throat. Not from the smallness of her <hi>Gulet;</hi> but for that in the longer half of it, the <hi>Muscular Fibers</hi> are continu'd in so close a spiral Line, as rather to seem <hi>Annular.</hi> Whereby, the <hi>Undulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> of the <hi>Gulet</hi> are more slowly and difficultly made. So that a more difficult swallow, being one thing necessary to make her not greedy, but patiently to watch for her Prey; Nature hath therefore contriv'd her <hi>Gulet</hi> for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</p>
                        <p>The Nervous Membrane, or (as in some <hi>Graminivorous Animals</hi> it may be call'd) <hi>Corpus Nervosum,</hi> hath hitherto been thought to serve only for sense. Dr. <hi>Willis</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures, That it is also the Instrument of some certain mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of expansion in <hi>Oscitation</hi> and <hi>Preternatural Inflation:</hi> which is all he saith.</p>
                        <p>But to Me, it seemeth, That it Cooperates with the Muscular Membrane to all the Natural Motions of the <hi>Gulet,</hi> in <hi>Deglutition, Vomition,</hi> and <hi>Eructation.</hi> And, to speak properly, That 'tis nothing else but a HOLLOW
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:47321:214"/>
TENDON; that is, the <hi>Tendon</hi> of the two Muscular Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes.</p>
                        <p>It may be Objected, That then it should lie above, not under the Membranes. But in a <hi>Gizard,</hi> we find the <hi>Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> spread within or underneath the Fleshy part of the Muscules, as well as above.</p>
                        <p>The truth of this will further appear, if we consider the great Thickness of this Membrane, where the most force<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able motions of the <hi>Gulet</hi> are required. For it would serve as well for sensation, if it were ten times as thin: the gross<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the sensory, not being necessary to the exquisiteness of the sense; but of the mover, always to the strength of the motion. And therefore, whereas the <hi>Cuticular</hi> or ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most Membrane is much of the same thickness in all Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals; the Nervous is much varied according to the thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness or thickness of the Muscular: that is, where the Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule is thick, the <hi>Tendon</hi> is proportionable. The notice of which in <hi>Oxen, &amp;c.</hi> sheweth the same use hereof in a man.</p>
                        <p>The Inmost Skin or Lining of the <hi>Gula,</hi> is to be a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection to the Nervous, as the outer is to the <hi>Muscular;</hi> that so nothing hard, salt, sower, or any way acrimonious, may be injurious to it. To keep it the better within bounds, in all the motions of the <hi>Gulet.</hi> To be the Bed of the Glands. And one seat of Thirst; which oftentimes lies no deeper than the Throat and upper part of the <hi>Gulet:</hi> and is cured by any thing which by moistening the Throat shall give vent to the <hi>Mucus stagnant</hi> therein.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> Of the Uses of the Stomachs of Quadrupeds.</head>
                     <p>ANd first, all <hi>Carnivorous Quadrupeds</hi> have the smallest <hi>Ventricles;</hi> flesh going farthest. Those that feed on Fruits and Roots have them of a middle size. Yet the <hi>Mole,</hi> because It feeds unclean, hath a very great one. <hi>Sheep</hi> and <hi>Oxen,</hi> which feed on <hi>Grass,</hi> have the greatest. Yet the <hi>Horse</hi> (and for the same reason the <hi>Coney</hi> and <hi>Hare</hi>) though
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:47321:215"/>
                        <hi>Graminivorous,</hi> yet comparatively have but little ones. For that a <hi>Horse</hi> is made for labour, and both This and the <hi>Hare</hi> for quick and continu'd motion: for which, the most easie Respiration, and so the freest motion of the <hi>Diaphragme</hi> is very requisite; which yet could not be, should the Stomach lie big and cumbersome upon it, as in <hi>Sheep</hi> and <hi>Oxen</hi> it doth. For which cause Nature hath here transfer'd the greater part of the <hi>Alimental Lugage</hi> into the <hi>Caecum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Neck of the Stomach, near the Gut, is commonly reflected backward, so as to make an acute Angle with the Back of it. To the end, the extrusion of the prepared <hi>Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> to the Gut, may be stinted. And that the thiner part, which will more easily wind about, may the better pass away, and leave the rest behind. Sometimes it hath three or four <hi>Flexures,</hi> as in <hi>Sheep</hi> and <hi>Oxen:</hi> for that the Gut being so small with respect to the <hi>Venter,</hi> and with all so very thin; it would, by too sudden or copious an irruption of the <hi>Aliment,</hi> be in danger of being burst. And for the same reasons, the Stomach of a <hi>Pig,</hi> so voraceous a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is also furnished with a Stopple.</p>
                     <p>The distinct uses of the Parts of the Stomach, are many of them the same as of the <hi>Gulet.</hi> I shall not therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat, but proceed to those particulars as remain to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated.</p>
                     <p>And first, 'tis plain, in those thick Stomachs of an <hi>Ox</hi> or a <hi>Sheep,</hi> that the carneous Membranes are true <hi>Muscules:</hi> which conducteth us more easily to believe that of a man also <hi>Muscular.</hi> 'Tis certain, that the <hi>Muscules</hi> of the <hi>Abdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> in some Animals, as in <hi>Squirels,</hi> are thiner than those of a mans Stomach.</p>
                     <p>Now the Nervous and Muscular Parts joyntly subserve to all the motions of the Stomach, which I reckon five, <hi>viz. Corrugation, Astriction, Undulation, Convulsion,</hi> and <hi>Voluntary Motion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Corrugation,</hi> is when there is a double motion of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, beginning from both the <hi>Orifices</hi> of the Stomach, and so drawing it up into innumerable small Wrinkles. For the better expression of the <hi>Mucus</hi> out of the <hi>Glands</hi> of the inner Membrane. For a closer comprehension of the <hi>Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and immission of the said <hi>Mucus</hi> or other fermenting Juyce, into it. And for the gradual expression of the colli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quated
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:47321:215"/>
parts thereof into the Gut. In this motion, the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most <hi>Muscular Fibers</hi> contract the Stomach in length; and the inermost, in breadth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Astriction,</hi> is a Contraction only about the <hi>Pylorus;</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the inermost <hi>Fibers</hi> alone. For the firmer Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the <hi>Aliment,</hi> and its orderly dismission into the Gut.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Undulation,</hi> is when the Contraction is made in several parts of the Stomach successively, beginning at one <hi>Orifice,</hi> or End, and terminating at the opposite. Made also by the Inner <hi>Fibers;</hi> after the same manner, as the <hi>Undulation</hi> or <hi>Peristaltick Motion</hi> of the <hi>Guts.</hi> The use of it, is either for <hi>Excretion</hi> or <hi>Eructation.</hi> If it begins from the <hi>Gulet,</hi> it serves, after the finest of the <hi>Aliment</hi> is discharg'd by <hi>Corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,</hi> for Excretion of the rest. But if the <hi>Undulation</hi> be Inverted, or begins from the <hi>Pylorus,</hi> it produceth <hi>Eructation.</hi> Answering to the like Inverted Motion, which sometimes happens in the <hi>Guts.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Convulsion,</hi> is a forcible and suddain Contraction of all the Orders of <hi>Fibers,</hi> outer, middle, and inmost. The use hereof with <hi>Undulation,</hi> is for <hi>Vomition.</hi> For first, there is only an Inverted <hi>Undulation,</hi> that is, I conceive, when there is only a <hi>Naucea</hi> or tendency to Vomit. Which <hi>Undulation</hi> also, carries part of the matter by degrees, to the upper mouth of the Stomach. And growing quicker and stronger, at last turns into a <hi>Convulsion;</hi> the Stomach being hereby contracted both in width and length, and the <hi>Pylorus</hi> forced up to the upper <hi>Orifice</hi> (as a <hi>Barbars Puff</hi> in powdering the <hi>Hair,</hi> or the <hi>Bladder</hi> in the Injection of a Clyster) and so produceth actual <hi>Vomition.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Voluntary Motion of the Stomach,</hi> is that only which accompanies <hi>Rumination.</hi> That it is truly voluntary, is clear, from the Command that Ruminating Animals have of that Action. For this purpose it is, that the <hi>Muscules</hi> of their <hi>Venters</hi> are so thick and strong; and have several <hi>Duplicatures</hi> as the Bases of those <hi>Muscules,</hi> whereupon the stress of their motion lies. By means whereof, they are able with ease to rowl and tumble any part of the meat from one Cell of the same Venter to another, or from one Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to another, or from thence into the <hi>Gulet,</hi> whensoever they are minded to do it. So that the Ejection of the meat
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:47321:216"/>
in Rumination, is a <hi>Voluntary Eructation.</hi> Not at all labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to them, because of the great strength of the Muscules of their Stomach and Gulet to command and govern the same.</p>
                     <p>By the Joynt assistance of the Glandulous and the Ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Membranes, the business of <hi>Chylification</hi> seems to be perform'd. The <hi>Mucous</hi> Excrement of the Blood being supply'd by the former, as an Animal <hi>Corrosive,</hi> preparing; and the Excrement of the Nerves by the latter, as an Animal Ferment, perfecting the Work. And the <hi>Caecus Ventricu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> of a <hi>Hog,</hi> seems to be a <hi>Repository</hi> provided for such a mixed <hi>Leven</hi> or <hi>Menstruum:</hi> whereby he not only becomes more voraceous, having thence continual irritations to eat: but all he eats, is thereby likewise well digested.</p>
                     <p>The Folds of the Stomach, which in its <hi>Corrugation</hi> must needs be much deeper than when it is dilated, or of use, To divide the <hi>Aliment</hi> into several Portions, and thereby ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister their Ferments not only to the Circumference, but intimate parts of the Mass to be fermented.</p>
                     <p>The pointed Knots, like little <hi>Papillae,</hi> in the Stomachs of divers Ruminating Beasts, are also of great use, <hi>viz.</hi> For the Tasting of the Meat. Dr. <hi>Willis</hi> describing the Inner Membrane of the Stomach (not of a Beast, but expresly of a Man) speaketh thus; <hi>Haec Crusta Ventriculum</hi> (Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num puta) <hi>intus obtegens, similis videtur Illi, quae Linguam obtegit.</hi> Wherein he was mistaken: this Inner Membrane being Glandulous; the Skin of the Tongue not so, but only Fibrous. But of divers Beasts which Ruminate, thus much is true, That in their Three first Venters, the Inner Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane is Fibrous, and not Glandulous; the fourth only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Glandulous, as in a man. Of the Fibers of this Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane and the Nervous, are composed those pointed Knots before described <note n="a" place="margin">Chap. 4.</note> both in substance and shape, altogether like to those upon the Tongue. Whence I doubt not, but that the said Three <hi>Ventricles,</hi> as they have a power of <hi>Volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Motion:</hi> so likewise, that they are the <hi>Seat</hi> of <hi>Tast,</hi> and as truly the <hi>Organs</hi> of that sense, as is the Tongue it self.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, and consequently, the said Nervous Knots, are of use to Methodize the Work of <hi>Rumination,</hi> after this manner. The Animal having eaten enough for the <hi>Panch</hi>
                        <pb n="27" facs="tcp:47321:216"/>
well to govern; rowles and tumbles the meat to and fro therein: and at the same time, with the help of the said Nervous Knots of several degrees of fineness (as the <hi>Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>smith</hi> hath his <hi>Assayers</hi> of several degrees of niceness) judges of the Courseness or Fineness, Crudeness, or Concoction of any part of it; and accordingly lets it rest, or removes it. So then the grossest of these <hi>Assayers</hi> standing about the <hi>Gulet,</hi> and so in the passage of the meat between the <hi>Panch</hi> and the <hi>Reticulum,</hi> being the proper judges of what is Course or Crude; if they find it so, then 'tis tumbled back to receive a further maturation in the <hi>Panch.</hi> If somewhat fine and Concocted, 'tis then permitted to pass on and rowl into the <hi>Reticulum.</hi> And the said <hi>Assayers</hi> or <hi>Nervous Knobs</hi> being here sharper and softer, than in the <hi>Panch;</hi> have still a more accurate Tast: and therefore what they yet find too course, the <hi>Reticulum</hi> forthwith throws it up into the Gulet and Mouth. From whence, being further refined, 'tis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to the <hi>Reticulum;</hi> and thence after a while, into the Third Stomach or the <hi>Omasus.</hi> And This again being a more nice <hi>Assayer</hi> than the <hi>Reticulum;</hi> if it feels the meat fine and soft enough, passeth it into the last Stomach or <hi>Abomasus.</hi> But if otherwise, throws it back into the <hi>Reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culum,</hi> and the <hi>Reticulum</hi> into the Gulet and Mouth to be labour'd once again, and so remanded.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> Of the Uses of the Guts of Quadrupeds.</head>
                     <p>I Shall here, as before, pass over such particulars as have been spoken of by others; and divers also which being observable in the Gulet and Stomachs, as well as here, have been already sufficiently explain'd.</p>
                     <p>And first the different Bore of the Guts is observable. So, for example, the Guts of a <hi>Horse</hi> are very wide. For that he both swalloweth, and dischargeth from his Stomach into his Guts, the meat more gross; which therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth a more open passage, lest it should clog. As also, that it may move with greater speed towards the <hi>Caecum,</hi>
                        <pb n="28" facs="tcp:47321:217"/>
here, <note n="a" place="margin">Chap. 6.</note> for the reason above-said, design'd by Nature to be a second Stomach. Whereas in an <hi>Ox</hi> or a <hi>Sheep,</hi> the meat having passed four successive Concoctions, 'tis thence deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to the Guts of a much finer substance; and so moveth safe enough throuh a much smaller Chanel; and fast enough, there being much less work here left, for the <hi>Caecum</hi> to perform.</p>
                     <p>The Contraction also of the Guts, or lessening of the Bore by several Necks, is of good use. As for instance, in an <hi>Urchan</hi> or <hi>Cat;</hi> serving to stint the Transition of the meat, that it be not over quick, and dividing the Guts into so many little <hi>Venters,</hi> in which the meat restagnates for some time, in order to its reception of as many repeated Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coctions. Whereby also in these Animals the work of the <hi>Caecum,</hi> and therefore the making of it, seems superseded.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, the rarious length of the Guts is observable, according to the cleanness, or more fewer nutritive parts of the Food; or its colliquability into <hi>Chyle.</hi> So in a <hi>Weesle</hi> or <hi>Squirel,</hi> that feeds much on Eggs, and Nuts, and such like fine and nutritive food, they are extream short. And in all Gross eaters, longer than in other <hi>Quadrupeds.</hi> And therefore one reason, why the Guts of a Sheep or <hi>Ox</hi> are slender, is, that they may be long. For were they shorter and wider, it would not be <hi>tantamount:</hi> For the food being <hi>Grass,</hi> it is not sufficient that they should hold enough: but also necessary, that they give a longer voyage to a substance so jejune, for a thorow solution and exuction of all its nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tritive parts. Besides, that in a smaller Channel, the said parts will all along lie nearer to the Lacteal Veins, and so more easily be express'd into them.</p>
                     <p>The Membranes of the Guts, have a general analogy in all <hi>Quadrupeds,</hi> and divers of their Uses have been well assign'd. I shall therefore only Note, That as the spiral <hi>Fibers</hi> contract or purse up the Bore of the Gut; so those that run by the length, draw it up shorter, and so dilate it. Whereby, as one part of the Gut may press the meat for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, or as it were disgorge it, so another gape to receive it, at the same time. And in case one Gut should by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or by some Bowel, be oppress'd, being by the said Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction in length removed a little out of its place; the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of its motion, or any thing therein, will thereby be regain'd.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="29" facs="tcp:47321:217"/>But in a <hi>Mole,</hi> the same <hi>Fibers</hi> which run by the length, being Indented, do also for a little way, each parcel obliquely run by the breadth of the Gut. Whereby they are able, without the help of spiral <hi>Fibers,</hi> to narrow or shorten the Gut of themselves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and also to do both in the same place. For by the Relaxation of the <hi>Fibers,</hi> the sides of every Indenture, must needs grow both wider and more distant, and the Gut wider and more extended, at the same time: and so <hi>Vice versa.</hi> Probably with this design, That the Shells of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sects</hi> may make a more safe transition, without raking against the tender sides of the Guts.</p>
                     <p>The Glands of the Guts are likewise of great Use. The <hi>Mucus</hi> which they spew, serves to make the Guts slip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, that the meat may the more easily and fasely glide along. As also for another Ferment superinduc'd to that of the Stomach, and so a further colliquation of the meat. With respect to both which Uses, the said Glands, according to the Bore of the Guts, the hardness or softness, courseness or colliquability of the meat, are more or less numerous; as in the precedent Examples.</p>
                     <p>And that this <hi>Mucus</hi> may be duly supply'd, Nature still allows <hi>Blood-Vessels</hi> proportionable to the plenty of Glands. And hath taken care that the Vessels enter not the Guts on the same side on which the Glands are seated, but the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site: that having space enough to branch themselves into the smallest capillary Tubes, before they reach the Glands, there may be the less danger, that any sincere Blood should with the <hi>Mucus</hi> make an Inundation into them.</p>
                     <p>Through the same Glands, as so many little Springs, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, That the Humours are either emunged, or precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated, out of the Blood, in Purgation. For that one so small a <hi>Pipe,</hi> as that of the <hi>Pancreas</hi> should bring so great a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, is not at all probable. And the Glands being a visible way, I know no reason, wherefore we should have recourse to any invisible one.</p>
                     <p>Thus the same Glands are a great means to prevent <hi>Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,</hi> and other ill effects of <hi>Cold</hi> by a <hi>Diarrhea.</hi> For when by a suddain astriction of the Pores of the Skin, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, the usual perspiration is stop'd: the redundant matter in the Blood, is often safely discharged, by the Glands, into the Guts. But if the matter be very sharp, or rusheth upon
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:47321:218"/>
the Glands too suddainly; it sometimes corrodes or breaks them, and so makes way for Blood also: as may be observ'd in the Guts of such as die of a <hi>Dysentry.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Use of the <hi>Caecum</hi> is manifold, but divers in divers Animals; according to the make of it, and the Relation it bears to the Stomachs and the Guts. And first, for the most part, it serves to give a second Deliberate Concoction to the meat, that nothing nutritive in it may be lost. For which purpose, it is always furnish'd with Glands, as well as the other Guts. And, with respect to its width, is commonly but thin, or less muscular, that so being less apt to constringe it self, it may give a due time of stay to the meat deliver'd to it. For which end also it is placed out of the common Road of the Guts; that being thereby less receptive of their <hi>Peristaltick Motion;</hi> it may lie the more still. For the same intent the <hi>Caecum</hi> in a <hi>Sheep</hi> hath several <hi>Flexures</hi> answerable to those in the <hi>4th</hi> Stomach or <hi>Abomasus.</hi> And in a <hi>Hog,</hi> 'tis drawn up into Cells on both sides, like the <hi>Colon,</hi> to make it so much the more retentive. In the <hi>Coney,</hi> the same is done still more effectually, by the spiral Plate, or Connivent <hi>Valve</hi> winding from end to end. And in the <hi>Horse,</hi> not by two only, but four Rows of Cells on the four sides. In which two last Animals the said Use is so eminent, that the <hi>Caecum,</hi> considering its bigness withall, is the chief Stomach, and much superior to the <hi>Stomach</hi> so call'd. And it is also ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servable, That the <hi>Abomasideus</hi> in a <hi>Rat,</hi> hath the same re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the <hi>Caecum;</hi> as in a <hi>Sheep,</hi> the <hi>Abomasus</hi> hath to the other Stomachs. Hence likewise it may be, that some Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals have little or no <hi>Caecum:</hi> either because the meat is so dissoluble, as not to need a second deliberate Concoction, as in a <hi>Weesle;</hi> or for that Nature hath made something else to serve without it; as those several Contractions in the Guts of a <hi>Cat;</hi> and the <hi>Valvulae Conniventes</hi> in the small Guts of a Man. Where we may observe, That these <hi>Valves</hi> are not every where spiral, as is thought, but do also make some perfect and distinct Rings: whereby they are fitter to retard the motion of the meat in its descent.</p>
                     <p>Another Use may be, For a Retreat; Either to the meat, if it should chance to rush too fast into the Gut below it: Or to the Excrements, in case the Animal is diverted from a present ejection of them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="31" facs="tcp:47321:218" rendition="simple:additions"/>The last Use, I shall name, may be this, That in case the meat, or the Excrements in the lower Guts should be at any time so dry and hard, as too slowly, and not without much stress to the Guts, to descend; the <hi>Caecum</hi> is as a <hi>Clyster-Bag,</hi> always ready with its liquid Content, to be in some part thereinto injected. For which purpose, it usually makes an acute angle with the upper Guts, and opens directly into those below it.</p>
                     <p>The Make of the Colon, with other Uses, also answers to the greater need of Retention. Either because of the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right posture, as in a Man; or frequent and speedy motions, as in a <hi>Horse</hi> or <hi>Hare:</hi> where, without the Cells of the <hi>Colon,</hi> to retain the Excrements from the <hi>Rectum,</hi> there would be a continual <hi>Conatus egerendi.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Rectum,</hi> or rather <hi>Stercoraceum</hi> of a <hi>Cat,</hi> being pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly of so great a bulk; I will conclude with a Conjecture of one Use of it: and that is, To be as a <hi>Counter-poise</hi> to her Head: whereby, from what height soever she falls, she still lights upon her feet.</p>

                     <p>BEcause that many particulars will here occur, which are intelligible from the former Descriptions, and have already been explain'd; I shall therefore be the shorter. Of about Forty, which I have open'd, I shall describe these Thirteen that follow, <hi>sc.</hi> of a <hi>Casowary,</hi> an <hi>Owl,</hi> a <hi>Cuckow,</hi> a <hi>Dunghil-Cock,</hi> a <hi>Tame Pigeon,</hi> a <hi>Jackdaw,</hi> a <hi>Starling,</hi> a <hi>Yellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hammer,</hi> a <hi>Bull-finch,</hi> a <hi>Wry-neck,</hi> a <hi>Bunting,</hi> a <hi>Reed-Sparrow,</hi> and a <hi>House-Swallow:</hi> and figure them all, but those of a <hi>Cuckow.</hi> With Notes upon others, as I proceed.</p>

                        <head>Of a Casowary.</head>
                        <p>The CASOWARY hath no Crop. But a wider Gulet, I suppose, as well as Guts, than in any other Bird. Far greater than those of an <hi>Ostrich;</hi> although the Body be much less. The Gulet, where widest, or near the Throat, about five inches
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:47321:219"/>
over; next the Stomach, two. Sprinkled with many small Glands, as it is, more or less, in all Birds.</p>
                        <p>At the bottom of it, the <hi>Echinus;</hi> common to all Birds that I have open'd. But here less conspicuous. The Figure hath not express'd it. It hath always a Lining of much larger Glands than those in the <hi>Gulet</hi> or <hi>Crop;</hi> commonly of an Oval Figure, and each of them with an open mouth spewing out a <hi>Mucus.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>He hath no Gizard (as hath the <hi>Ostrich</hi>); yet a thick Muscular Stomach, as in other Carnivorous Birds. Almost of an Oval shape; and small with respect to the Guts: ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed somewhat too big for the Scale, (as also the <hi>Gulet</hi> and <hi>Guts</hi>) in the Figure. The <hi>Pylorus</hi> guarded with a kind of <hi>Valve.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>Guts</hi> not two yards and half long. Beside the two <hi>Caeca,</hi> are three. The larger, next the Stomach: as it is, in almost all other Birds. About three inches and ½ over, where widest. The smaller, somewhat above two. The <hi>Rectum,</hi> the largest, <hi>sc.</hi> about four. Much wider than even those of a <hi>Horse,</hi> excepting only his <hi>Caecum</hi> and his <hi>Colon.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>He hath two <hi>Caeca;</hi> as have almost all Birds. Yet here very small, about ½ a foot long, but no thicker than a Womans little Finger. Here, as in all other Birds, making obtuse Angles with the <hi>Rectum.</hi> So that what is said of them in Mr. <hi>Willughby's Ornithologia,—Cum Intestino Recto an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulos acutos faciunt:</hi> was only a slip of that most accurate Pen.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Rectum</hi> is separated from the next above, by a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivent <hi>Valve.</hi>

                        <p>The <hi>Gulet</hi> of a young Grey-OWLE, is of an indifferent size. At the bottom of it, the <hi>Echinus.</hi> And somewhat more apparent, than in the <hi>Casowary,</hi> but less than in most frugivorous Birds.</p>
                        <p>The Stomach, a middle Thing betwixt that of other Carnivorous Birds, and a <hi>Gizard, sc.</hi> a plain Bag, yet in the middle somewhat Tendinous.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Guts</hi> in length two feet and ½. Three, besides the

                           <hi>Caeca.</hi> The first or <hi>Amplum,</hi> a foot long; and above ¼ of an inch broad.

                        <p>The <hi>Caeca,</hi> four inches and ½ long.

                        <p>The <hi>Rectum,</hi> three inches long; towards the <hi>Anus,</hi> near an inch wide; almost in the Figure of a little <hi>Pear.</hi> As it is also in most <hi>Wild-Fowl.</hi>

                        <p>Neither hath this Bird any Crop, nor a Gizard. But to the Gulet it is peculiar, That it hath Ten or Twelve Rows of more conspicuous Glands, which run along from the Throat to the <hi>Echinus.</hi>

                        <p>The Stomach, a plain Bag, much like to that of an <hi>Owle;</hi> yet somewhat thicker, and more Tendinous.</p>

                        <p>A DUNGHILL-COCK, hath one Stomach or Ventricle more than the former Birds, <hi>sc.</hi> a Crop: all over be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sprinkled with small Glands, somewhat more visible than in the Gulet.</p>
                        <p>The upper part of the <hi>Gulet,</hi> leading to the <hi>Crop,</hi> ¼ of an

inch over. But the lower part, leading from it towards the <hi>Echinus,</hi> very slender, not above ¼ wide.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Echinus</hi> almost an Oval shape, being divided from the Gizard by a pretty long and slender Neck. And may therefore be properly call'd the <hi>Second</hi> or <hi>Oval Ventricle.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Third, is the <hi>Gizard,</hi> in the place of the plain Bag or Stomach in the former Birds. 'Tis made of Six <hi>Muscules</hi> and a <hi>Cartilaginous Lining</hi> in the greater Concave; which may be called the <hi>Laboratory.</hi> Those four, which make the greatest part of the <hi>Gizard,</hi> may be called the <hi>Grinders.</hi> Of extraordinary thickness; whereby the length of the Convex, is cross to the length of the Concave of the <hi>Gizard.</hi> Yet thinner towards the Edges, so as to make a kind of dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Hyperbola.</hi> In the Centre hereof on both sides meet the <hi>Tendons</hi> of the said <hi>Muscules,</hi> continued or expanded for about ½ an inch in breadth, without any Carneous or Red <hi>Fibers</hi> mixed with them. From whence, they are divided, the one, which is the stronger, spread over, the other, under the <hi>Muscules;</hi> into which they are also branched all the way, so as meeting in the body of the <hi>Muscule</hi> they make a sort of fine Cancellated Work, as may be seen better in the <hi>Gizard</hi> of a <hi>Goose;</hi> especially in a thin slice hereof par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boyl'd, and held up against a <hi>Candle.</hi> And in all <hi>Gizards,</hi> so as to be seen to run cross, as in that of a <hi>Pullet</hi> in <hi>Tab.</hi> 29.</p>
                        <p>The Fifth <hi>Muscule</hi> is that which standeth between the <hi>Echinus</hi> and the four <hi>Muscules</hi> now describ'd, and may be called the <hi>Deductor,</hi> from the use hereafter mention'd. Very thin with respect to the former; placed at the upper end of the left edge of the <hi>Gizard,</hi> and spread a little on the side, but not so much as in the Figure. Better represented, <hi>Tab.</hi> 29.</p>
                        <p>The Sixth, is such another <hi>Muscule,</hi> standing opposite to the former, <hi>sc.</hi> on the right edge of the <hi>Gizard,</hi> and may be called the <hi>Reductor,</hi> as shall be shew'd why.</p>
                        <p>The four <hi>Grinders</hi> are strengthened within, not only with a <hi>Tendon,</hi> but a Gristly Lining, thicker than the outer <hi>Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> with a rough surface, and wrinkled into several <hi>Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse Furrows,</hi> from one end to the other.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Guts</hi> are about a yard and ½ long. Three besides the <hi>Caeca.</hi> The first, the smaller; contrary to what it is in most Birds. Not much above ¼ of an inch, where widest.

                        <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> Of the Uses of these Parts.</head>
                     <p>THe <hi>Gulets</hi> of Birds, are bigger or less, according to the quantity they swallow. More or less Glandulous, according to the Solidity, or the Dryness of their Meat. And with respect to the same, the Figure thereof is more simple; or expanded into a <hi>Crop;</hi> by which it is retain'd a longer time, before it further descends. And according as less or more Time is requir'd, the <hi>Crop</hi> is made so, as either to have its <hi>Axis,</hi> the same with that of the <hi>Gulet;</hi> or else to stand Collateral, and so open <hi>transversly</hi> into it.</p>
                     <p>After the Meat hath been sufficiently macerated there, it descends into the <hi>Echinus,</hi> for a second preparation. So much the more thorowly made here, because by far greater Glands. And what was done before to all at once, is here in, to smaller parcels. This Part in some sort answering to the <hi>Crop,</hi> as the <hi>Reticulum,</hi> in a <hi>Sheep,</hi> to the <hi>Panch.</hi> Withall it should seem, That when the <hi>Gizard</hi> is either over loaded, or the Meat not enough prepar'd; 'tis thence returned back to this Part, (as the <hi>Reticulum</hi> also subserves the <hi>Omasus</hi>) till It and the <hi>Gizard</hi> are more ready, one for the other. For which end also the <hi>Muscular Neck</hi> below the <hi>Echinus,</hi> serves as a Sphincter to purse it up.</p>
                     <p>At length it descendeth into the Third <hi>Ventricle.</hi> Either Membranous, as in most <hi>Carnivorous Birds;</hi> where the Meat is concocted as in a Man. Or somewhat Tendinous, as in an <hi>Owle;</hi> as if it were made indifferently for Flesh, or other Meat, as he could meet with either. Or most Thick and Tendinous, called <hi>The Gizard;</hi> wherein the Meat, as in a Mill, is ground to pieces, and thence pressed by degrees into the Guts in the form of a <hi>Pulp.</hi> For which purpose, the <hi>Deductor</hi> serves to deliver the Meat from the <hi>Echinus</hi> to the <hi>Laboratory;</hi> as a <hi>Hopper</hi> to a <hi>Mill.</hi> The four Grinders or chief Operators, as the <hi>Millstones:</hi> Partly, as they are extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Thick, and made with double Tendons; whereby they are constring'd with the greater force. And partly, as their Tendons stand high in the centre, so as to be <hi>arched:</hi> for so, every time the Tendons are contracted, they must
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:47321:223"/>
needs make a shallower Arch, and so force the insides of the Grinders closer together. And as the <hi>Millstones</hi> are peck'd and cut with small Gutters, least their force should be evaded: so the Gristly Lining of the Gizard is all over rough, and gather'd into answerable Furrows. And because the force<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able motion of the Grinders, must needs work the Meat from under them: as therefore in some <hi>Mills</hi> there is one attends still to turn the Grist under the Stone; so the <hi>Rë<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductor</hi> here, to deliver it back to the Grinders, and so over and over, till it be sufficiently elaborated for the Guts.</p>
                     <p>And as the strong and continual motion of all these <hi>Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules,</hi> is taught us from their structure, so likewise from their red colour, which especially in the Grinders is intense. Hence in a <hi>Fish,</hi> the <hi>Muscules</hi> which move the <hi>Fins</hi> are usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally Red, although the rest of the Flesh is very white: And so the Leg of a <hi>Domestick Fowl.</hi> Whereas the Wings also of a <hi>Wild Fowl,</hi> are of the same colour. So likewise the Flesh of a driven <hi>Calf,</hi> or of a <hi>Hare,</hi> though that of a <hi>Coney</hi> be white. And that which comes nearer, the Heart in all Creatures, having the like continual motion, is of a Red Colour.</p>
                     <p>The Guts are of different length and bigness, not always proportionable to that of the Bird, but the nature of the Meat. So those of a <hi>Casowary,</hi> though it be necessary, that they should contain Meat enough for so great a Body: yet not, that the Meat, which is very nutritive, should make any long voyage. Yet is it needful there should be a <hi>Connivent Valve</hi> before the <hi>Rectum,</hi> for the guarding of so open a pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage. And so with Variety in other Birds, according as they feed on <hi>Worms, Seeds, Fruits, Flys,</hi> or <hi>Shell'd Insects,</hi> requiring a longer, or more open passage, for their more deliberate, or safer Transmission to the <hi>Anus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Indentures</hi> also seem to be made, and with variety; to the same Intent: <hi>sc.</hi> That the Guts hereby receiving the greater Contraction and Dilatation, may so much the more forceably detrude the Meat, or more easily give way to it; as it is softer, or mixed with Shells, Stones and the like.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Caeca,</hi> especially where large, and made for a further Concoction of the Meat; for the better Retention hereof, where they open into the <hi>Rectum,</hi> are very straight. And for the same reason, also thinner and less <hi>Muscular</hi> than the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:47321:224"/>
other Guts: that so the Meat therein may lie the more quiet.</p>
                     <p>The ampliation of the <hi>Rectum,</hi> chiefly in <hi>Wild Fowls,</hi> amongst other Reasons, is, I suppose, That the Dung lying there in good quantity, may be as a <hi>Counter-poise</hi> to the Head, to keep it up in flying.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. X.</hi> Of the Stomachs and Guts of FISHES.</head>
                     <p>IN so many as I have open'd, two Things are more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally observable, <hi>viz.</hi> That many of them have no Stomach, that is one that is not Belly'd; as in the <hi>Salmon, Jack, Tench, Barble, Breme:</hi> or very little, as in the <hi>Place.</hi> And many more, instead of One <hi>Caecum,</hi> as in some <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drupeds;</hi> or Two, as in most Birds; have three or four, as the <hi>Pearch;</hi> nine or ten, as the <hi>Rochet;</hi> many more, as the <hi>Trout,</hi> above thirty; the <hi>Whiting,</hi> above forty; the <hi>Salmon</hi> many more.</p>
                     <p>The Stomach of a <hi>Place</hi> shaped almost like the <hi>Echinus</hi> of a Bird. Bounded at the bottom with a <hi>Connivent Valve.</hi> The Guts two only. The upper end of the first, hath two little extuberant Parts, the use whereof may be answerable to one use of the <hi>Caecum, sc.</hi> To divert the Meat, lest upon any Inverted Motion of the Gut, it should regurgitate into the Stomach, or strain the <hi>Valve.</hi> The bottom of this Gut is separated from the <hi>Rectum,</hi> by another pretty <hi>Connivent Valve:</hi> both which, and the visible Texture of the <hi>Fibers,</hi> are shewed in the last <hi>Table.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Stomach of a <hi>Salmon</hi> is only like a wide Gut. He hath about fourscore <hi>Caeca,</hi> hanging on the great Gut, almost like the <hi>Mane</hi> upon the <hi>Neck</hi> of a <hi>Horse.</hi> Being ty'd alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with small Vessels, and the Vessels hid with Fat; they have been mistaken by some for a <hi>Pancreas.</hi> The <hi>Rectum</hi> is guarded with about thirty <hi>Annular Valves.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Whiting</hi> hath a large Stomach, which is a distinct Bag or Belly. And numerous <hi>Caeca,</hi> not standing as in the <hi>Salmon,</hi> but all in a Ruck. The Stomach and Guts of a <hi>Cod</hi> are very like.</p>
