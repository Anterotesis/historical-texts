            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

and caused mee to adde four more,

            <p>And now (Dearly Beloved) having
this fair opportunity to speak to you in
writing, give mee leave to propound and
lay before you some <hi>cautions and admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions;</hi>
some <hi>Rules</hi> and <hi>Directions</hi> for
the right ordering of your lives and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versations
in these dangerous and divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
times, that so you may bee able af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
my decease, to have them in perpetual
remembrance.</p>
            <p>1 Take heed of <hi>mistaking</hi> in the <hi>great
<pb facs="tcp:57918:5"/>
work</hi> of <hi>Beleeving</hi> and <hi>Repenting.
Faith</hi> and <hi>Repentance</hi> are the two great
<hi>Gospel-graces:</hi> And the reason why so
many miscarry to all eternity, is not for
<hi>want</hi> of them (such as they are) but upon
a <hi>pure mistake,</hi> in thinking they have
them, when they have but a <hi>shadow of
them.</hi> Where one goeth to Hell by <hi>despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi>
hundreds go thither by <hi>presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
O! quam multi cum hâc vanâ
fide, &amp; vana spe ad aeternos labores de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendunt;
How many thousands go to
hell with a vain faith, and hope of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven!</hi>
And therefore bee much in exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
whether your Faith be right or no.
Examine your selves,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 13. 5</note> 
               <hi>whether yee bee
in the Faith, prove your own selves.</hi>
To bee mistaken in the great work of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving,<note place="margin">Mark. 16. 16</note>
is to bee <hi>necessitated to dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</hi>
For hee that <hi>beleeves not, shall
bee damned.</hi> Ask your souls often, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
your <hi>Repentance</hi> bee of a right
stamp or no; whether it bee a <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
unto life, a Repentance never
to bee repented on.</hi> To bee mistaken
<pb facs="tcp:57918:5"/>
in <hi>purchasing of Lands,</hi> can but <hi>hurt
your outward estates;</hi> but to bee mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
in the graces of <hi>Faith and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
will undo your souls to all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity.</hi>
What the Characters of a true
Faith, and true Repentance are, you
have frequently heard, I will not now
repeat them. Only remember that <hi>self-flattery,</hi>
is <hi>self-mockery;</hi> that <hi>soul-delusion,</hi>
is soul-damnation. Pray unto
God to deliver you from that <hi>great
murderer of souls,</hi> the sin <hi>of Presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2 <hi>Take heed (as I have said) of</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laying,
<hi>and</hi> putting off the great work
of providing for Heaven, till sickness
or old age. <hi>The Lord Christ commands
you</hi> to seek first the Kingdome of God,
and his Righteousness, &amp;c. <hi>First,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
other things, <hi>first,</hi> more than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things. <hi>You must seek after Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in the</hi> first <hi>and</hi> chief place, <hi>and
if you seek it in the</hi> least <hi>and</hi> last place,
<hi>you will never obtain it. In matters of</hi>
weight delay is dangerous, Abigail

O labour to bee <hi>Christians,</hi> not only in

11. 23, 24. And thou</hi> Capernaum
<hi>which art exalted unto Heaven, shalt

the mighty works which have been

unto this day. But I say unto you,
that it shall bee more tolerable for the
land of</hi> Sodome <hi>in the day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

to praise the Sermons you hear, to
admire, and stand astonished at the
Doctrine delivered. If you do not <hi>pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise</hi>
what is <hi>preached.</hi> If you do not
<hi>live Sermons, as well as hear them,</hi>
it shall bee easier for <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrha</hi>

               <hi>That the love of
money is the root of all evill, which

And what the Apostle <hi>John</hi> saith, <hi>Love

               <hi>neither the things that

A <hi>Saint</hi> is one who <hi>hath much of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

A child of God is seldome without

and unmoveable, &amp;c. The God
of grace, who hath called you into
his eternal glory by Jesus Christ,
make you perfect, stablish, strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en,
and settle you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>17 <hi>Remember that it is the</hi> will of
Jesus Christ, <hi>that you who partake of the</hi>
same word of life, <hi>and of the</hi> same Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental
Bread and Wine, should
admonish one another, exhort one
another, watch over one another, bear
the burdens of one another, provoke
one another to love and good works;
seek the good of one another, and not
<pb facs="tcp:57918:15"/>
your own good only. That you should
warn the unruly, comfort the feeble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded,
and support the weak. <hi>That
this is your duty appears, from</hi> Col. 3.
16. Phil. 2. 4. Heb. 1. 24. Gal. 6. 1.
Rom. 15. 2. Rom. 14. 7. 2. Cor. 5. 15.
1 Thes. 5. 11, 13, 14. <hi>The 12th.</hi> vers.
<hi>speaks of</hi> Ministerial and authoritative
admonition, <hi>but the 13, and</hi> 14. verses
<hi>of</hi> fraternal and charitative. <hi>These Texts
will rise up in Iudgement against thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands
of Christians at the last day.</hi> I do not
say that you are to admonish none but
those of your own Society. Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<hi>is an</hi> act of mercy; <hi>It is</hi> spiritualis
Eleemosyna, spiritual Almes, <hi>and you
are bound by the</hi> royal law of charity,
<hi>by the</hi> communion of Saints, <hi>the</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of Churches, <hi>and</hi> communion
of natures, <hi>to distribute these spiritual
almes to all that need them, as</hi> God <hi>shall
give occasion.</hi> But this I say, <hi>you ought
especially to admonish them, and watch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
them. This is</hi> novum, <hi>though not</hi>
solum vinculum. <hi>Some Divines think
<pb facs="tcp:57918:16"/>
that one chief reason why the</hi> Israelites
<hi>were punished for</hi> Achans sin, <hi>was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they did not</hi> admonish him, <hi>and</hi>
watch-over him: <hi>For</hi> the Israelites
<hi>were commanded in the plural number,</hi>
Josh. 6. 18. Keep your selves from the
accursed thing, &amp;c. <hi>Hee was</hi> one of the
body, <hi>and because they did not</hi> watch
over him, <hi>they</hi> communicated in his sin,
and in his punishment. <hi>There is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Law in this Nation,</hi> That every
Parish shall provide for its own poor.
<hi>And by</hi> parity of reason, <hi>it is</hi> as just and
equal, That every Congregation
should chiefly <hi>and</hi> especially look <hi>to
the souls of their</hi> own members, <hi>to</hi>
warn them, admonish them, exhort
them, <hi>and</hi> watch over them.</p>
            <p>That you may the better discharge
this duty, you must labour to bee <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
one with another,</hi> as far as
<hi>your Callings</hi> and <hi>Relations</hi> will give
you leave. It is a <hi>great and common sin,</hi>
and much to bee lamented, <hi>That there is
so little knowledge and acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:57918:16"/>
between those that are of the same
<hi>Congregation.</hi> They <hi>sit in the same Pew
together, partake of the same Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
and yet <hi>converse no more toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
than if one lived at <hi>York,</hi> and the
other at <hi>London.</hi> And when they <hi>do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
together,</hi> it is <hi>a meer civill and
outward converse, as amongst sober
heathens:</hi> But there is very little <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
society</hi> between them, for the
<hi>spiritual edification one of another.</hi>
Now this must needs bee a great sin; For
how can you watch over one another, edifie
and admonish one another? How can you
support the weak, comfort the feeble-minded,
if not spiritually acquainted one
with another.</p>
            <p>And yet it is not my <hi>opinion,</hi> that
every member of a <hi>Congregation</hi> is
bound to know every <hi>fellow-member.</hi>
I beleeve it was not so in the <hi>Church of
Jerusalem,</hi> or of <hi>Samaria.</hi> It is <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible,
to</hi> think that they all knew one
another. I should bee loath to lay such a
<hi>clog upon you consciences,</hi> as to say,
<pb facs="tcp:57918:17"/>
               <hi>That every maid-servant, and man-servant
is bound to know, and to bee
acquainted with all those with whom
they communicate in the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</hi>
Indeed the <hi>Church-officers</hi> are <hi>the
eyes</hi> of the people, and are to know all,
and to bee acquainted with all: But yet
notwithstanding this, I say, It is the duty
of every <hi>member,</hi> to endeavour ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his <hi>place and calling,</hi> to grow
up in spiritual acquaintance one with
another, as <hi>God</hi> shall offer occasion, and
not to be so strange and unacquainted, but
to <hi>walk in love one towards another,
to bear one anothers burden, and so
fulfill the Law of Christ,</hi> Gal. 6. 2.</p>
            <p>And this you ought the rather to do,
that so you may <hi>contribute</hi> to the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the <hi>Sacrament of the Lords
Supper pure in the Congregation to
which you belong.</hi> There is much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
amongst many (and not without
just cause) of <hi>mixt communions,</hi> and
of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap> 
               <hi>universal liberty</hi> which some take
in giving the Sacrament promiscuously
<pb facs="tcp:57918:17"/>
to all that come, though grosly ignorant,
and notoriously scandalous, and in mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
(If I may so speak) the <hi>Chancel-door,</hi>
as <hi>wide</hi> as the <hi>Church-door.</hi>
This in my judgement is a great ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</p>
            <p>1 It is to <hi>give holy things to Dogs,
and to cast Pearls to Swine.</hi> It is <hi>a
prophanation</hi> of the <hi>Ordinance,</hi> in giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it to those who are <hi>visibly unworthy</hi>
to receive it, and to whom wee know
<hi>Christ</hi> would not have us to give it.</p>
            <p>2 It is an <hi>act of great uncharitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
to those who are grosly ignorant,
and scandalous. For it is to give them
that which <hi>wee know</hi> will further their
<hi>damnation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3 It makes the <hi>Church-Officers</hi>
(who have power to hinder them, and do
not use it) <hi>partakers of other mens
sins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4 It is an <hi>Act of cruelty</hi> to the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi>
For because wee have been <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal
of Christs blood,</hi> therefore hee
hath been <hi>Prodigal of ours.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:57918:18"/>
5 It is a great <hi>scandal</hi> to the <hi>truly
godly,</hi> and a <hi>stumbling-block</hi> to <hi>weak
Christians,</hi> causing them (though unad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visedly)
to separate from our Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>6 It is to <hi>walk contrary</hi> to the practise
of most (if not all) of the <hi>Churches of
Christ</hi> in the Christian world.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To prevent this</hi> Sacrament-propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation;
<hi>there are some</hi> Ministers, <hi>wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
wholly surcease from administring it. This
I allow not, unless in case of absolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity.
For this is (as it were) to</hi> suspend
<hi>the</hi> whole Congregation, <hi>and to deny</hi>
Children <hi>their</hi> bread, <hi>for fear of</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
it to Dogs. <hi>The best way is to follow
the advice which our</hi> Lord Jesus Christ
<hi>gives,</hi> Matth. 18. 15, 16, 17. <hi>where hee
propounds</hi> Rules <hi>and</hi> Directions <hi>for the
removing of scandals out of the Church.</hi>
If thy Brother shall trespass against
thee <hi>(saith Christ)</hi> go and tell him his
fault between thee and him alone.
<hi>Hee doth not say,</hi> Go, and separate pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
<hi>(For this is to</hi> rend the Church,
<pb facs="tcp:57918:18"/>
               <hi>not to</hi> heal it; <hi>This is to</hi> hinder thy
Brother from Christ, <hi>rather than to</hi>
gain him to Christ. <hi>Hee doth not say,</hi>
Go and tell others <hi>(for this is to</hi> back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite
thy Brother. <hi>This is to</hi> reproach
<hi>him, rather than to</hi> reprove <hi>him) But hee
saith,</hi> Go and tell him his fault be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
thee and him alone; if hee
shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy
Brother: But if hee will not heare
thee, then take with thee one or two
more, &amp;c. And if hee shall neglect to
hear them, tell it to the Church <hi>(that
is, to such who are impowred by Christ
to redress offences)</hi> but if hee neglect to
hear the Church, let him, &amp;c. <hi>Hence
learn,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That all <hi>Church-reformation,</hi> and
<hi>Sacrament-purity</hi> must begin from
<hi>Church-members,</hi> and proceed from
them in <hi>Christs way</hi> unto <hi>Church-of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers;
That if any man who is called a
Brother, bee a Fornicator, or a Railer;
or a Drunkard, or guilty of any other
scandalous sin,</hi> It is your duty, who are
<pb facs="tcp:57918:19"/>
members of the same body with him,
and know his guiltiness, to labour by
<hi>private admonition to gain him to God,</hi>
not to <hi>shame him</hi> by telling others, but
to <hi>gain him,</hi> by telling him alone. But
if hee will not hear you, then you are in <hi>an
orderly way,</hi> to bring it to the <hi>Church,</hi>
which if you <hi>neglect to do,</hi> the sin of
<hi>Church-pollution</hi> is <hi>your sin,</hi> and not
the <hi>sin</hi> of your <hi>Church-officers.</hi> If there
bee <hi>three doors</hi> to get into an house, hee
that keeps mee out of the <hi>first,</hi> keeps mee
out of the <hi>other two.</hi> All <hi>Sacrament-reformation</hi>
begins with you, <hi>you are
the first door at which it enters:</hi> if
you faile of your duty, the sin lyeth at your
door, not at ours. It is the custome of all
people (though otherwise godly) if a <hi>scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous
sinner</hi> bee admitted to the <hi>Lords
Supper,</hi> to charge the sin of it upon the
Minister, and in the mean time to forget
that the sin is <hi>theirs,</hi> not <hi>his,</hi> because
they have not done what <hi>Christ</hi> would
have them, for the <hi>gaining of him,</hi> and
for the <hi>inabling</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
<pb facs="tcp:57918:19"/>
against him by <hi>censures,</hi> if hee
prove obstinate. The <hi>Lord</hi> give you hearts
to thinke of this, and <hi>give you grace</hi>
(instead of murmuring against, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining
of mixt communions, and of
separating from us because of them) to
<hi>contribute</hi> your utmost towards the <hi>pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging</hi>
of our Congregations, and to <hi>pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise</hi>
all those duties which <hi>Christ</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
of you in order thereunto.</p>
            <p>I have much more to say of this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,

is not a verse (except one onely, say
some Learned men in Print, but are
therein deceived; but I may truly say,
Except the 122. and the 90. verses) in
this long <hi>Psalm,</hi> wherein there is not

            <p>This Text that I have chosen, sets
out the great benefit and comfort,
which <hi>David</hi> found in the Law of
God in the time of his affliction—<hi>It
kept him from perishing.</hi> Had not thy

The word <hi>Law</hi> is taken diversly in
Scripture, sometimes for the <hi>Moral
Law,</hi> Jam. 2. 10. Sometimes for the
whole <hi>Oeconomy, Polity,</hi> and <hi>Regiment</hi>
of <hi>Moses,</hi> for the whole <hi>Mosaical dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation</hi>
by Laws, partly Moral, partly
Judicial, partly Ceremonial, <hi>Gal. 3.
23.</hi> Sometimes for the <hi>five Books of
Moses,</hi> Luke 24. 44. Sometimes for
the whole <hi>Doctrine of God,</hi> contained
in the <hi>Scriptures</hi> of the <hi>Old Testament,</hi>
Joh. 7. 49. By Law in this place is
meant, all those Books of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
which were written when this
Psalm was penned. But I shall handle
it in a larger sense, as it comprehends
all the Books both of the Old and
New Testament. For the word <hi>Law</hi>
is sometimes also taken for the <hi>Gospel,</hi>
as it is <hi>Micah 4. 2. Isa.</hi> 2. 3. The mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
then is, <hi>Unless thy Law,</hi> that is, Thy
<hi>Word,</hi> had been my <hi>delights, I should
have perished in mine Affliction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>David</hi> speaks this (saith <hi>Musculus)</hi>
of the distressed condition hee was
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57918:23"/>
in, when persecuted by <hi>Saul,</hi> forced to
flye to the <hi>Philistins,</hi> and sometimes to
hide himself in the rocks and caves of
the earth. <hi>Hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

It is very likely (saith hee) that hee
had the Book of Gods Law with him,
by the reading of which, hee mitiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and allayed his sorrows, and kept
himself pure from communicating
with the Heathen in their superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
The <hi>Greek</hi> Scholiasts say, That
<hi>David</hi> uttered these words, <hi>A Saule
pulsus, &amp; apud Philistaeos &amp; impios ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines
agere coactus,</hi> when driven from
<hi>Saul,</hi> and compelled to live amongst
the wicked <hi>Philistins,</hi> &amp;c. for he would
have been allured to have communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
with them in their impieties,
had he not carried about him the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation
of the word of God. <hi>Unless
thy Law had been my delights, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the words themselves, wee have
two Truths <hi>supposed,</hi> and one Truth
clearly <hi>proposed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:57918:24"/>
1 Two Truths supposed.</p>
            <p>1 That the dearest of Gods Saints,
are subject to many great and
tedious Afflictions.</p>
            <p>2 That the word of God is the Saints
darling, and delights.</p>
            <p>One Truth clearly proposed.</p>
            <p>That the Law of God delighted in,
is the afflicted Saints Antidote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
ruine, and destruction.</p>
            <p>1 Two Truths supposed.</p>
            <p>The first is this:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. That the best of Gods Saints
are in this life subject to many great
and tedious Afflictions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>David</hi> was a man after Gods own
heart, and yet hee was a man made up
of troubles of all sorts and sizes, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch
as hee professeth of himself,
Psal. 69. 1, 2, 3. <hi>Save mee, O God, for
the waters are come in unto my soul, I sink
in deep mire where there is no standing,
I am come into deep waters, where the
flouds over-flow mee; I am weary of my
crying, my throat is dryed, mine eyes
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57918:24"/>
fail while I wait for my God.</hi> And in this
Text he professeth that his afflictions
were so great, that he must necessarily
have perished under them, had hee
not been sustained by the powerfull
comforts he fetched out of the word.
There is an emphasis in the word
<hi>Then,</hi> I should <hi>then</hi> have perished:
that is, long before this time; <hi>then,
when</hi> I was afflicted, then I should have
perished. <hi>Iunius</hi> and <hi>Tremelius</hi> tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slate
it, <hi>Iam diu periissem, &amp;c.</hi> I
should long ago have perished. <hi>Iob</hi>
was a man <hi>eminent</hi> for godliness, and
yet as <hi>eminent</hi> for afflictions. Nay
jesus Christ himself was a <hi>man of sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows,</hi>
Isa. 53. 3. Insomuch as that it is
truly said, <hi>God had one Son without sin,
but no Son without sorrow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This our <hi>Dear Sister,</hi> at whose Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
wee are met, was a woman full
of many and great afflictions, which
(no doubt) would have quite drowned
and swallowed her up, had not the
<hi>Word of God</hi> supported her, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:57918:25"/>
it was that shee desired that this
Text might bee the subject of her
Funeral Sermon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> But why doth God afflict his
own children with such variety of long
and great Afflictions?</p>
            <p>Ans. 1. <hi>God doth not do this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
hee</hi> hates <hi>them, but because hee</hi>
loves <hi>them,</hi> For whom the Lord loveth
hee chastiseth, &amp;c. <hi>Heb. 12. 6. Did
the Lord hate them, hee would suffer
them to go merrily to Hell.</hi> There is
no surer sign of Gods reprobating anger,
than to suffer a man to prosper in wicked
courses. <hi>God threatneth this as the</hi>
greatest punishment, not to punish them,
<hi>Hos. 4. 14. And therefore because
God loveth his children,</hi> hee chastiseth
them in this world, that they may not bee
condemned in the world to come, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
11. 33.</p>
            <p>2 God doth not do this, because
hee would hurt them, but for their
<hi>good,</hi> Jer. 24. 5. The <hi>good figs</hi> were sent
into Captivity for their <hi>good.</hi> Heb.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57918:25"/>
12. 10. <hi>Hee for our profit, &amp;c.</hi> God hath
very gracious and merciful ends and
aims in afflicting his people. Give mee
leave here to inlarge my Discourse, and
to give you an account of some of
these Divine aims.</p>
            <p>1 Gods design is to teach us to <hi>know
him,</hi> and <hi>to trust in him,</hi> and <hi>to know our
selves.</hi> It is a true saying of <hi>Luther,
Schola crucis, est Schola lucis,</hi> the School
of <hi>Affliction,</hi> is a School of <hi>Instruction,</hi>
Gods <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> are <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, His <hi>rods</hi>
(when sanctified) are powerful <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi>
to teach us,</p>
            <p>1 <hi>To know God,</hi> And <hi>this is life E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
to know him,</hi> Joh. 17. 3. It is
said of <hi>Manasseh,</hi> a Chron. 33. 13.
<hi>Then Manasseh knew that the Lord hee
was God.</hi> Then, when hee was caught
among the thorns, bound with setters,
and carried to <hi>Babylon;</hi> before that
time hee knew not the Lord: Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
teach us to know God, not only in
his power and greatness, in his anger,
and hatred against sin, but also in his
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:57918:26"/>
goodness and mercy; For <hi>God</hi> doth so
<hi>sweeten</hi> the bitter cup of affliction, that
a childe of God doth many times taste
more of Gods love in one months af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction,
than in many years of prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
2 <hi>Cor. 1. 4, 5. 2 Cor.</hi> 7. 4. Adde
to this. Afflictions teach us to know
God <hi>Experimentally</hi> and affectionative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
not <hi>cerebraliter</hi> (as <hi>Calvin</hi> saith) but
<hi>cordialiter,</hi> so to know him, as to <hi>love</hi>
and <hi>fear</hi> him, and to <hi>flye</hi> unto him as our
rock and hiding-place in the day of our
distress. It is said, <hi>Cant. 3. 1. By night
I sought him whom my soul loveth, &amp;c.</hi>
Some by the word <hi>Night,</hi> understand
the night of divine desertion, and from
the words <hi>Gilbertus</hi> hath this saying,
<hi>Qui quaerit in nocte, non quaerit ut videat,
sed ut amplectatur;</hi> Hee that seeks after
God in the night of adversity, doth not
seek to see him, and know him formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and superficially, but to imbrace
him, and to love him really and cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally:
And therefore the Church ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
left till shee had <hi>found Christ,</hi> and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:57918:26"/>
when shee had found him, <hi>shee held him</hi>
and would not let him go, <hi>Cant.</hi> 3. 2,
3, 4.</p>
            <p>2 Not onely to know God, but also
<hi>to trust in him,</hi> 2 Cor. 1. 9. <hi>Wee had the
sentence of death in our selves, that wee
should not trust in our selves, but in God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
which raiseth the dead.</hi> Note here,
1 That an <hi>Apostle</hi> is apt in time of
prosperity, to trust in himself. 2 That
God brings his children to the gates
of death, that they might learn not to
trust in themselves, but in God, which
<hi>raiseth the dead,</hi> that is, from a dead and
desperate condition.</p>
            <p>3 Not onely to know God, but to
<hi>know our selves,</hi> which two are the
chief parts of Christian Religion: It
is said of the Prodigal, that when hee
was in adversity, then hee <hi>came to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,</hi>
Luke 15. 17. <hi>And when hee came
to himself.</hi> He was <hi>spiritually distracted,</hi>
when hee was in <hi>prosperity:</hi> Afflictions
teach us to know that wee are but
men, according to that of <hi>David,</hi> Psal.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:57918:27"/>
9. 20. <hi>Put them in fear, O Lord, that they
may know themselves to bee but men.
Caligula</hi> and <hi>Domitian,</hi> Emperors of
<hi>Rome,</hi> who in prosperity would bee
called Gods, when it thundred from
Heaven, were so terrified, that then
they knew they were but men. In
prosperity wee forget our mortality.
Adversity causeth us to know, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that wee are men, but frail men,
that God hath us <hi>between his hands</hi> (as
it is <hi>Ezek. 21. 17.)</hi> and can as easily
crush us, as wee do moths: That wee
are in <hi>Gods hands, as the Clay in the
hands of the Potter:</hi> That hee hath an
absolute soveraignty over us, and that
wee depend upon him for our being,
well-being, and eternal-being. These
things wee know feelingly and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
in the day of Affliction. And it
much concerns us to know these
things, and to know them powerfully.
For this will make us stand in awe of
God, and study to serve and please
him. Hee that depends upon a man
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:57918:27"/>
for his livelihood, knowing that hee
hath him at an advantage, and can ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
undo him, will certainly endeavor
to comply with him, and to obtain
his favour. <hi>The ground of all service
and obedience is dependence.</hi> And did
wee really and experimentally know
our dependence upon God, and the
advantages hee hath us at, wee could
not, wee would not but comply with
him, and labour above all things to
gain his love and favour.</p>
            <p>2 Gods aim in afflicting his children,<note place="margin">The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of God in afflicting his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</note>
is either to <hi>keep them from sin,</hi> or when
they have sinned; <hi>to bring them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
for it, and from it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1 <hi>To keep them from sin;</hi> This made
him send an <hi>Angel of Satan</hi> to buffet
<hi>Paul,</hi> lest hee should bee <hi>lifted up in
pride, and exalted above measure,</hi> 2 Cor.
12. 7.</p>
            <p>2 When they have sinned to bring
them to <hi>repentance for it, and from it.</hi>
God brings his children <hi>low,</hi> not to
<hi>trample</hi> upon them, but to make them
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:57918:28"/>
               <hi>low in their own eyes,</hi> and to <hi>humble</hi>
them for sin, <hi>Deut.</hi> 8. 2. God brings
them into the <hi>deep waters,</hi> not to <hi>drown</hi>
them, but to <hi>wash and cleanse</hi> them,
Isa. 27. 9. <hi>By this shall the iniquity of
Iacob bee purged, and this is all the fruit,
to take away sin, &amp;c.</hi> Afflictions (when
sanctified) are divine Hammers, to
break, and as <hi>Moses</hi> his Rod, to cleave
our rocky hearts in peeces.</p>
            <p>1 They <hi>open the eyes</hi> to see sin <hi>Ocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los
quos culpa claudit, paena aperit.</hi> When
the <hi>brethren of Ioseph</hi> were in <hi>adversity</hi>
then they saw (and not before) the
greatness of their sin in selling their
Brother, <hi>Gen,</hi> 42. 21.</p>
            <p>They <hi>open</hi> the <hi>ear to Discipline.</hi> In
prosperity wee turn a deaf ear to the
voyce of the charmer, though he charm
never so wisely. But adversity open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the ear, and causeth us to attend:
When God spake upon Mount <hi>Sinah</hi>
in a terrible manner, then the people
said unto <hi>Moses, Speak thou unto us, all
that the Lord our God shall speak unto
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:57918:28"/>
thee, and wee will hear it, and do it,</hi>
Deut. 5. 27. Memorable is that Text,
Jer. 2. 24. <hi>A wilde Ass used to the
Wilderness, that snuffeth up the wind at
her pleasure, in her occasion who can turn
her away? all they that seek her, will not
weary themselves, in her month they shall
finde her; in her month,</hi> that is, when she
is great with young, and near her time.
A wicked man in the day of his pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity,
is like a wilde Ass used to the
wilderness, hee snuffeth at any that
shall reprove him, hee is of an uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised
ear, and a rebellious heart,
<hi>but in his month,</hi> that is, when hee is
<hi>bigge with Afflictions,</hi> then hee will be
easily found; this will open his ear to
Discipline.</p>

sin,</hi> Judg. 10. 15.</p>

            <p>Afflictions are <hi>Gods Furnaces,</hi> to purge
out the dross of our sins, <hi>Gods files</hi> to
pare off our spiritual rust, <hi>Gods Fannes</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:57918:29"/>
to winnow out our chaffe. In prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
wee gather much soil, but adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
purgeth and purifieth us. This is
its proper work, to work out unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
<hi>Dan. 11. 35. Dan.</hi> 12. 10.</p>
            <p>3 Gods end is not only to keep us
from sin,<note place="margin">The third Design.</note> but to make us <hi>holy and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,</hi>
therefore it is said, <hi>Isa. 26. 9.
When they judgements are in the earth, the
inhabitants of the world will learn righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness.</hi>
And <hi>Heb. 12. 10.—Hee for
our profit, that wee may bee partakers of
his holiness.</hi> As the waters that
drowned the old world, did not <hi>hurt</hi>
the <hi>Ark</hi> of <hi>Noah,</hi> but bare it up above
the earth, and as they increased, so the
Ark was lifted up nearer and nearer to
Heaven: So <hi>Afflictions</hi> (when sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
do not prejudice the <hi>Saints of God,</hi>
but lift them up nearer unto God in
<hi>holiness, and heavenly-mindedness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4 Gods design in afflicting his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
is to make the <hi>world bitter</hi> unto
them,<note place="margin">The fourth Design.</note> and <hi>Christ sweet.</hi> 1 To <hi>imbit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the world:</hi> There are two lame leggs
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:57918:29"/>
upon which all worldly things stand,
<hi>uncertainty,</hi> and <hi>insufficiency.</hi> All earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
things are like the earth, founded
upon nothing. They are like <hi>heaps
made of wax,</hi> that quickly melt away.
Riches, and honours, wise, and children,
have <hi>wings, and flye away;</hi> they are like
unto <hi>Absoloms Mule,</hi> they will fail us,
when wee have most need of them;
They may <hi>puffe up</hi> the soul, but they
cannot <hi>satisfie it, inflare possunt, satiare
animam non possunt:</hi> They are all vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and vexation of spirit, so saith the
<hi>Preacher;</hi> but most people in time of
health, will not beleeve these things;
but when some great sickness betides
them, this is as a <hi>real Sermon,</hi> to make
out the truth of them; then they see,
that a <hi>Velvet slipper</hi> cannot cure the
<hi>Gout,</hi> nor a <hi>golden cap</hi> the <hi>head ache,</hi>
Prov. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>. 4. That riches avail not in
the day of wrath, and this imbitters
the world.</p>
            <p>2 To make <hi>Christ sweet and precious.</hi>
When <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Disciples</hi> were in a
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:57918:30"/>
ship together, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8. 25. it is said,
<hi>That Christ was asleep,</hi> and as long as
the Sea was calm, his Disciples suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him to sleep, but when they were
ready to bee drowned, then they <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woke
Christ,</hi> and said, <hi>Master, save us,
wee perish.</hi> Even the <hi>best of Saints</hi>
when fatted with outward plenty and
abundance, are prone to suffer <hi>Christ <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
lye asleep within them,</hi> and so neglect
the <hi>lively actings</hi> of Faith upon <hi>Christ;</hi>
but when the storms of affliction, and
outward calamity begin to arise, and
they are ready to bee overwhelmed
with distresses, then <hi>None but Christ,
none but Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5 Gods design in afflicting his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
is to <hi>prove,</hi> and <hi>improve</hi> their
graces.</p>
            <p>1 To <hi>prove their graces,</hi> Rev. 2. 10.
Deut. 8. 2. to prove the <hi>truth,</hi> and the
<hi>strength</hi> of them. 1 The <hi>truth and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity
of their graces;</hi> For this cause he
loaded <hi>Iob</hi> with afflictions, to try whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hee served God for his Camels
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:57918:30"/>
and Oxen, or for love to God. As <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomons
sword</hi> tried the true <hi>Mother</hi> from
the <hi>false;</hi> So the <hi>sword</hi> of affliction
discovers the sincere Christian from
the hypocrite. Distresses are <hi>divine
touchstones,</hi> to try whether we be true or
counterfeit Saints; <hi>That grace is true,
which upon tryal is found true.</hi> 2 To
try the <hi>strength of our graces.</hi> For it
requires a strong faith to indure great
afflictions. That Faith which will suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
for a <hi>little</hi> affliction, will not suffice
for a <hi>great</hi> one. <hi>Peter</hi> had faith enough
to come to <hi>Christ</hi> upon the <hi>Sea,</hi> but
assoon as the <hi>storm began</hi> to arise, his
<hi>Faith</hi> began to fail, and Christ said,
<hi>Why art thou afraid, O thou of little
Faith?</hi> Mat. 14. 30, 31. It must bee a
<hi>strong Faith</hi> that must keep us from
sinking in the day of <hi>great Distress.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2 To <hi>improve our graces.</hi> It is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
of the <hi>Lionesse,</hi> that she leaves
her young ones, till they have almost
killed themselves with roaring, and
howling, and then at last gasp, shee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:57918:31"/>
relieves them, and by this means they
become more couragious. So God
brings his children into the deeps, and
suffers <hi>Ionah</hi> to bee three daies and
three nights in the belly of the Whale,
and <hi>David</hi> to cry till his <hi>throat was dry,</hi>
Psal. 69. 3. and suffers his Apostles to
bee all the night in a great storm till
the fourth watch, and then hee comes
and rebukes the winds, and by this
means hee mightily increaseth their <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience</hi>
and <hi>dependence</hi> upon God, and
their Faith in Christ. As the <hi>Palm-tree,</hi>
the more it is depressed, the higher,
stronger, and fruitfuller it grows; So
doth the graces of Gods people.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly, Gods aim in afflicting his
people, is to</hi> put an edge upon their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and all their other holy services.</p>
            <p>1 Upon <hi>Prayer:</hi> What a famous
Prayer did <hi>Manasseh</hi> make, when hee
was under his iron fetters. It is thrice
mentioned, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 33. 13, 18, 19.
When <hi>Paul</hi> was struck off his horse,
and struck with blindness, then hee
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:57918:31"/>
prayed to purpose. Therefore it is said,
<hi>Act. 9. 11. Behold hee prayeth!</hi> In pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity
wee pray heavily and drowsily,
but adversity adds wings to our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
<hi>Isa.</hi> 26. 16. The very heathen
Marriners cryed aloud to God in a
storm. It is an ordinary saying, <hi>Qui
nescit orare discat navigare.</hi> There are
no Saylors so wicked, but they will
pray when in a great storm.</p>
            <p>2 Upon <hi>Preaching.</hi> Prosperity
glutteth the spiritual appetite, adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
whetreth it.</p>
            <p>3 Upon a <hi>Sacrament.</hi> How sweet is
a Sacrament to a true Saint after a
long and great sickness?</p>
            <p>1 <hi>It makes God, and the word of God
precious.</hi> If God sets our Corn-fields
on fire (as <hi>Absalom</hi> did <hi>Ioabs)</hi> then hee
shall bee sure to cause us to come run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to him: And how sweet is a text
of Scripture to a childe of God in the
hour of his distress?</p>
            <p>By all this it appears that God afflicts
his children not to <hi>hurt them,</hi> but to
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:57918:32"/>
               <hi>help them,</hi> and that God hath many
glorious and gracious ends and aimes
in afflicting of them. Therefore it is
that <hi>David</hi> saith of himself in the 71.
verse of this Psalm, <hi>It is good for mee
that I have been afflicted, that I might
learn thy Statutes,</hi> Hee never said, It is
good for mee that I have been in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity,
but hee rather saith the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
in the 67. verse, <hi>Before I were
afflicted, I went astray, but now I have
kept thy word. Gods people</hi> will bless
God as much (if not more) in <hi>Heaven,</hi>
for their <hi>adversity,</hi> than for their <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Use</hi> 1. Let us not pass <hi>rash censures</hi>
upon <hi>persons</hi> under <hi>great afflictions.</hi> Say
not, such a woman is a greater sinner
than others, because more afflicted.
This was the fault of <hi>Iobs</hi> friends, and
God expresseth his anger against them
for it, <hi>Iob 42. 7. My wrath is kindled
against thee, and thy two friends, for you
have not spoken the thing that is right, &amp;c.</hi>
This was the fault of the <hi>Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:57918:32"/>
Act. 28. 4. <hi>When they saw the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemous
beast hang upon the hand of</hi>
Paul, <hi>they said among themselves, no
doubt this man is a murderer, &amp;c.</hi> But
remember they were <hi>Barbarians.</hi> It is
a sign of a <hi>Barbarian,</hi> not of a <hi>Christian</hi>
to pass a rash censure upon persons in
affliction. Think you (saith Christ)
<hi>that those eighteen upon whom the Tower
in</hi> Siloam <hi>fell and slew them, that they were
sinners above all men that dwelt in</hi> Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem.
<hi>I tell you, nay, but except you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
ye shall all likewise perish,</hi> Luke 13.
4, 5. Think you that they which have
the stone and gout in extremity, that
have cancers in their faces and breasts,
are greater sinners than others. I tell
you nay, &amp;c. For my part, if I would
censure any, it should bee such as live
wickedly, and meet with no affliction:
These have the <hi>black brand</hi> of reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
upon them. These are men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
to damnation. <hi>Ambrose</hi> would
not tarry a night in the house of a
Gentleman that had never in all his
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:57918:33"/>
life been afflicted, for fear (as hee said)
lest some great and sudden judgement
should betide it. But when I see a
godly woman afflicted, then I say, this
is not so much for her sin, as for her
trial; this is not to <hi>hurt her,</hi> but to <hi>teach</hi>
her to know God, and to know her
selfe, to break her heart for sin, and
from sin, to make the world bitter, and
Christ sweet. God hath put her into
the fire of affliction, to refine her, and
make her a vessel fit for his use. God
is striking her with the hammer of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction,
that shee may bee squared, and
made ready to bee laid in the heavenly
<hi>Ierusalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Use</hi> 2. Here is <hi>rich comfort to the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of God,</hi> under the <hi>greatest afflictions.</hi>
For the best of <hi>Saints</hi> are subject to the
worst afflictions: This is the lot of all
Gods children, Christ himself not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted.
<hi>Afflictions</hi> (indeed) conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in their own nature, are evil things,
and so are called, <hi>Amos 5. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</hi> They
are part of the curse due to sin, the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:57918:33"/>
fruit of Gods revenging wrath; they
are as a biting and stinging Serpent. And
to a wicked man, remaining wicked,
they are the beginning of Hell: <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanctified
afflictions parboil a wicked man
for hell and damnation.</hi> But now to a
childe of God, they have lost both
their <hi>name</hi> and <hi>nature,</hi> they are not <hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments</hi>
properly, but <hi>chastisements,</hi>
not <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. They are
not <hi>satisfactory,</hi> but <hi>castigatory.</hi> Jesus
Christ hath taken away the <hi>sting of these
Serpents;</hi> they are not <hi>fiery,</hi> but brazen
Serpents, they have a <hi>healing,</hi> not a
<hi>hurting</hi> power. Christ hath removed
the curse, and bitterness of them; as
the wood sweetned the <hi>waters of Marah,</hi>
Exod. 15. 25. So <hi>Christs Cross</hi> hath
sweetned the <hi>bitterness</hi> of Afflictions.</p>
            <p>There are eight comfortable consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations
to chear the heart of a childe
of God in the day of his distress.</p>
            <p>1 God never afflicts his people, but
ut of <hi>pure necessity,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 6. <hi>Though
ow for a season, if need bee, yee are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aviness.</hi>
As a most loving <hi>Father,</hi>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:57918:34"/>
never corrects his childe, but when he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
is forced to it. Hee willingly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides
for his childe, but punisheth him
unwillingly. So <hi>God</hi> freely <hi>loadeth</hi> with
his blessings, but hee never <hi>chastiseth</hi>
his children, but when <hi>forced</hi> to it,
therefore hee saith expresly, <hi>Lam. 3.
33. Hee doth not afflict willingly,</hi> Isa.
27. 1. <hi>Fury is not in mee.</hi> It is wee that
put Thunderbolts in Gods hand. If
the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n did not first draw up the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours
from the earth, there would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
bee any thundering, or lightening.
God would never thunder from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
with his judgements, if our sins did
not first cry to Heaven for punishment.
As <hi>Christ whipt</hi> the sellers of Oxen and
Sheep out of the Temple with a <hi>whip
made</hi> (in all probability) of <hi>their own
cords;</hi> So <hi>God</hi> never scourgeth us, but
it is with a whip made of our own sins,
<hi>Prov. 5. 22. Rom. 2. 5.—Thou treasurest
up to thy self, &amp;c.</hi> God hath a <hi>double trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,</hi>
a <hi>treasure of mercy,</hi> and a <hi>treasure
of wrath;</hi> his <hi>treasure of mercy</hi> is alwayes
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:57918:34"/>
full, but his <hi>treasure of wrath</hi> is empty,
till wee fill it by our sins. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when God punisheth his children,
hee calls it a <hi>strange work,</hi> and a <hi>strange
act,</hi> Isa. 28. 21. It is observed of the
Bee, that it never stings, but when pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked:
Sure I am, that God never
afflicts his children, but out of pure
necessity.</p>
            <p>2 Not only out of <hi>pure necessity,</hi> but
out of true and real love; as I have
shewed, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 6, 7, 8.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> Do not divine afflictions pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
out of anger? Was not God angry
with <hi>Moses</hi> for speaking unadvisedly
with his his lips? And angry with <hi>David</hi>
for his Adultery, and thereupon afflicted
both of them?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> This anger was a Fatherly
anger, rooted in love; It was not <hi>ira
quae reprobat,</hi> but <hi>ira quae purgat:</hi> It was
not <hi>ira hostilis &amp; exterminativa,</hi> but
<hi>ira paterna &amp; medicinalis.</hi> As it is a
great punishment, for God sometimes
not to punish, <hi>Isaiah 1. 5. Hos.</hi> 4. 14.
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:57918:35"/>
So it is a great mercy, sometimes for
God to withdraw his mercy.</p>
            <p>3 Afflictions are a part of <hi>Divine
predestination.</hi> That God which hath <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected</hi>
us to <hi>salvation,</hi> hath also <hi>elected us
unto afflictions,</hi> 1 Thes. 1. 3. <hi>That no man</hi>
should bee moved by these afflictions; <hi>for
you your selves know that wee are appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
thereunto.</hi> The same love with
which God elects us, and bestoweth
Christ, and his Spirit upon us, with the
very same love hee afflicts us.</p>
            <p>4 They are part of the <hi>gracious
Covenant</hi> which God hath made with
his people, <hi>Psal.</hi> 89. 31, 32, 33. In
which words we have three things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable.</p>
            <p>1 A supposition of sin; <hi>If his children
forsake my Law, &amp;c.</hi> For sin is alwayes
<hi>causa sine qua non,</hi> the cause without
which God would never chastise us,
and for the most part it is the cause for
which.</p>
            <p>2 <hi>Wee have a gracious promise,</hi>
Then I will visit their transgression with
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:57918:35"/>
the rod, and their iniquity with stripes.</p>
            <p>3 <hi>Wee have a merciful qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi>
Nevertheless my loving kindnesse
will I not utterly take from him, nor suffer
my faithfulness to fail, my Covenant will
I not break, &amp;c. <hi>Afflictions are not only</hi>
mercies, <hi>but</hi> Covenant-mercies; <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi>
David <hi>saith,</hi> Psal. 119. 75.—and
that thou in faithfulness hast afflicted
mee. <hi>God would bee</hi> unfaithful, <hi>if hee
did not afflict his children.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5 Consider that afflictions are part
of the <hi>Saints blessedness,</hi> Job. 5. 17.
<hi>Behold! happy is the man whom God cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recteth,
&amp;c.</hi> Behold (saith <hi>Eliphaz)</hi>
and wee had need behold, and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it, for there are few that beleeve
it, and yet it is most true; That af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions
(when sanctified) when they
are not only <hi>corrections,</hi> but <hi>instructions,</hi>
then they are evidences that wee are in
a blessed condition. <hi>Eliphaz</hi> his saying
must bee interpreted by what <hi>David</hi>
saith, <hi>Psal.</hi> 94. 12. Blessed is the man
whom thou chastenest, O Lord, and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:57918:36"/>
               <hi>teachest out of thy Law;</hi> It is not <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection</hi>
simply, but <hi>correction</hi> joyned
with <hi>instruction,</hi> which intitles us to
happiness. <hi>Iob even while hee was upon
the dung-hill, wonders that God should
set his heart so much upon him, as to visit
him every morning, and try him every
moment,</hi> Job 7. 17, 18. <hi>Iob</hi> upon the
<hi>Dung-hill,</hi> was happier than <hi>Adam</hi> in
<hi>Paradise. Adam</hi> in Paradise was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered
by the Devil; but <hi>Iob</hi> upon
the Dung-hill overcame the Devil. <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus</hi>
in his <hi>Rags</hi> was happier than <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves</hi>
in his <hi>Robes; Philpot</hi> in his <hi>Cole-house,</hi>
than <hi>Bonner</hi> in his <hi>Palace;</hi> and godly
Mr <hi>Whitaker</hi> upon his <hi>bed of pain,</hi> than
a wicked man upon his <hi>bed of Down<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
There were many in Christs time who
would never have known him, or come
to him, had it not been for their bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
diseases.</p>
            <p>6 Consider the <hi>gracious and merciful
ends, aims, and designes,</hi> that God hath
in afflicting his people, what these are,
ye have heard already.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:57918:36"/>
7 The <hi>sweet and precious promises,</hi>
which hee hath made to his children in
the day of their adversity, to comfort
them, and support them; what these
are, you shall hear afterwards.</p>
            <p>8 Consider that all <hi>afflictions</hi> shall
work at last for the <hi>good of Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</hi>
Rom. 8. 28. Though they are
not <hi>bonae,</hi> yet they shall bee in <hi>bonum;</hi>
Though they are not good in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
yet they shall turn to their

Christ hath said expresly, <hi>Ioh. 16. 33. In

            <p>3 There is <hi>sufficiens necessitas, suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
necessity</hi> to provoke God to afflict
them. It is needful that the <hi>Wheat</hi> bee
winnowed, that so the chaffe may bee

the <hi>Wind</hi> blow upon the <hi>Wheat,</hi> to

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:57918:38"/>
When the <hi>Sheep of Christ</hi> are divided
one from the other in judgement, and
affections, when separated in <hi>Doctrine,
Worship,</hi> and <hi>Discipline.</hi> It is very need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
that God should send afflictions and
distresses, which may bee (as the <hi>Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds

to unite them together, and
to <hi>gather</hi> them into one <hi>Sheepfold.</hi> And
therefore let the Saints of God expect
afflictions.</p>
            <p>2 <hi>Let us</hi> prepare and provide against

hee should <hi>use</hi> them! And therefore
if wee would bee comforted in the day
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:57918:38"/>
of tribulation, wee must provide afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand
a furniture of graces.</p>
            <p>1 A <hi>true Faith</hi> (for a <hi>painted Faith</hi>
will avail no more than a <hi>painted helmet</hi>
or a <hi>painted ship)</hi> and not only a <hi>True,</hi> but
also a <hi>strong Faith.</hi> A little faith will
faint under great afflictions; when the
winds began to blow fiercely, <hi>Peters</hi>
little Faith began to fail, <hi>Mat.</hi> 14. 30.</p>
            <p>2 <hi>A great measure of patience</hi> to inable
us to wait <hi>quietly</hi> and contentedly, till
God come in with help, for many times
hee tarrieth till the fourth watch of
the night, as hee did, <hi>Matth.</hi> 14. 25.
And therefore wee have need of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
to keep us from murmuring or
repining.</p>
            <p>3 <hi>A great stock of Self-denial, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,
repentance, contempt of the world,
and heavenly-mindedness.</hi> Hee that is
furnished with grace in an evill hour,
will bee as safe and secure, as <hi>Noah</hi> was
in the Ark, in the time of the Deluge,
or as those were who had sufficiency of
corn in the time of the seven years
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:57918:39"/>
dearth in <hi>Aegypt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2 <hi>A stock of assurance of Salvation:</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 A stock of Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</note>
For though a man hath never so much
grace, yet if hee wants the assurance
of it, hee cannot receive any comfort
by it in the day of his distress. <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi>
was not at all quieted in his spirit, for
<hi>Iosephs</hi> being alive, till hee came to
know of it. And therefore wee must
not onely provide <hi>grace,</hi> but the assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of grace, that wee may bee able
to say with confidence, as <hi>Iob</hi> did up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the dung-hill, <hi>Iob 19. 25. I know
that my Redeemer liveth,</hi> and with the
holy Apostle, <hi>Rom. 8. 38. I am perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
that neither death, nor life, nor
Angels, nor Principalities, nor Powers,
nor things present, nor things to come, nor
height, nor depth, nor any other creature
shall bee able to separate us from the love
of God, which is in Christ Iesus our
Lord.</hi> That man who hath got a Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
assurance of his salvation, will bee
more than a Conqueror in the day of
his distress.</p>

               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:57918:39"/>
3 <hi>A stock of Divine Experiences.</hi>
               <note place="margin">3 A stock of Divine Experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note>
Happy is that man that lodgeth up in
his heart all the former Experiences he
hath had of Gods love and mercy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him, and knoweth how to argue
from them in the day of calamity:
Thus did <hi>Moses</hi> in his prayer to God,
<hi>Numb. 14. 19. Pardon, I beseech thee,
the iniquity of this people, according unto
the greatness of thy mercy, and as thou
hast forgiven this people from Egypt, even
untill now.</hi> Because God had forgiven
them, therefore <hi>Moses</hi> intreats him
to forgive them; this Argument is
drawn from former experience. And
thus <hi>David</hi> incourageth himself, 1 <hi>Sam.
17, 37. The Lord hath delivered mee out
of the paw of the Lion, and out of the paw
of the Bear, and hee will deliver mee out
of the hand of this Philistine.</hi> Thus
also <hi>Paul</hi> reasoneth, 2 <hi>Cor. 1. 10. Who
delivered us from so great a death, and
doth deliver, and in whom wee trust that
hee will yet deliver us!</hi> Divine experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
are the Saints great incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:57918:40"/>
in the day of Affliction. Blessed
is the man that hath his quiver full of
these arrows.</p>
            <p>4 <hi>A stock of Sermons.</hi> Wee must do
with Sermons,<note place="margin">4 A stock of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.</note> as the Trades-men do
with the mony they get; some of it they
lay out for their present use, and some
of it they lay up against the time of
sickness. That man is an ill husband,
and an unthrifty Trades-man that
makes no provision for old age; or for
an evill day; and that man is an unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
hearer of the word, who doth
not stock and store himself with Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
whereby hee may be comforted
in the hour of affliction. And therefore
the Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> adviseth us, <hi>Isa 42.
23. to hear for the time to come,</hi> or (as
it is in the Hebrew) <hi>for the after-time.</hi>
Sermons are not onely to bee heard
for our present use, but to bee laid up
for after-times, that when wee lye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
our sick-beds, and cannot hear Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
wee may then live upon the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
wee have heard.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:57918:40"/>
5 And lastly,<note place="margin">5 A stock of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises.</note> Wee must prepare
and provide a <hi>stock of Scripture-promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi>
which will bee as so many <hi>reviving
Cordials,</hi> to chear us, and as so many <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Anchors,</hi> to uphold us from pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing
in the day of our tribulation.
What these promises are, you shall hear
afterwards: These upheld <hi>David</hi> in
the hour of his distress, and therefore
hee saith in the Text, <hi>Unless thy Law
had been my delight, I had perished in
mine affliction.</hi> If this our <hi>dear Sister</hi>
had not had this <hi>stock,</hi> shee had been
quite <hi>overwhelmed</hi> under the grievous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of her tormenting pains. Bee wise
therefore, O yee <hi>Saints of God,</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
these five provisions in the time
of health, that so you may live joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
in the time of sickness.</p>
            <p>3 As wee must expect and provide
for afflictions,<note place="margin">3 Gods people are to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions.</note> so also wee must labour
(when afflicted) <hi>to improve them for our
spiritual benefit and advantage.</hi> Wee
must pray more for the sanctification
of them, than for their removal: It
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:57918:41"/>
was not the <hi>staffe</hi> of <hi>Elisha</hi> that revived
the dead childe, but <hi>Elisha</hi> himself. It
was not the <hi>troubling</hi> of the waters of
the Pool of <hi>Bethesda,</hi> that made them
healing, but the coming down of the
<hi>Angel.</hi> It was not the <hi>Clay and spittle</hi>
that cured the blinde eyes, but <hi>Christs
anointing</hi> them with it. It was not the
<hi>cloak</hi> of <hi>Elijah</hi> that divided the waters,
but the God of <hi>Elijah:</hi> Troubles,
stroaks, blows, afflictions, and distresses
will do us no good, unless the Lord
bee pleased to make them effectuall;
And therefore let us pray unto God
that hee would give us grace together
with our affliction. That hee would
adde <hi>instruction</hi> to his <hi>correction,</hi> that
hee would make us <hi>good schollars in the
school of afflictions,</hi> and inable us to take
out all those excellent lessons, which
hee would have us to learn in it, that
thereby wee may come to <hi>know God
more powerfully, and experimentally, and
tok now our selves, and our own frailty,
and our absolute de pendene upon God
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:57918:41"/>
more effectually,</hi> that thereby wee may
bee more <hi>purified and refined,</hi> that the
<hi>wind</hi> of <hi>temptation</hi> may <hi>cleanse</hi> us from
the <hi>chaffe</hi> of our <hi>corruption,</hi> that wee
may <hi>learn righteousness</hi> by Gods <hi>judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
and bee made <hi>partakers</hi> of his
<hi>holiness.</hi> Such a good Scholar was <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasseh,</hi>
hee got more good by his <hi>Iron
chain,</hi> than by his <hi>Golden chain:</hi> Such
another was the <hi>Prodigal childe,</hi> who
was <hi>happìer</hi> amongst the <hi>Swine,</hi> than
when in his <hi>Fathers house;</hi> Such was
<hi>Paul,</hi> his being <hi>strucken</hi> down to the
ground, raised him up to Heaven; by
the <hi>blindness</hi> of his body, his soul recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<hi>sight;</hi> and hee was turned from a
persecuting <hi>Saul,</hi> to a persecuted <hi>Paul.</hi>
Such another was <hi>David,</hi> who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth
of himself, that <hi>it was good for
him that hee was afflicted;</hi> and such
Scholars ought wee to bee.</p>
            <p>There are some that are <hi>arrant Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
in this School, that are like unto the
<hi>bush</hi> which <hi>Moses</hi> saw, which burned
with fire, but was not consumed;
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:57918:42"/>
the fire did not consume the thorny
bush. Many such <hi>thorny</hi> sinners are
burnt up with the fire of divine affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
but their sins are not consumed.
Of these the Prophets complain, <hi>Amos
4. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.—Yet they have not
returned, &amp;c.</hi> Jer. 5. 3. <hi>Thou hast stricken
them, but they have not grieved; thou hast
consumed them, but they have refused to
receive correction; they have made their
faces harder than a rock, they have refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to return.</hi> Rocks and stones by hew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and polishing may bee made fit for
a building: But there are some men
who by no afflictions will bee amended.
<hi>The Mountains melt at the presence of the
Lord, and the rocks rend asunder, when
hee is angry:</hi> But there are some that
have made their <hi>faces harder</hi> than the
<hi>Rocks,</hi> and the <hi>Mountains,</hi> and are not
at all affected with Gods anger. Of
such as these <hi>Bernard</hi> complains, <hi>Multi
humiliati, pauci humiles, corripimur, sed
non corrigimur, plectimur, sed non flecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur;
Multo facilius fregeris quam
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:57918:42"/>
flexeris. Non cessant vitia civium usque
ad excidia civitatum; Prius est interire
quam corrigi. Prius ipsos, quam in ipsis
vitia non esse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are others that are the <hi>worse
for their afflictions,</hi> like the <hi>Smiths
Anvil,</hi> the more they are stricken, the
harder they are: Such a one was King
<hi>Ahaz,</hi> 2 Chron. 28. 22. <hi>In the time of
his distress hee did trespass yet more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Lord:</hi> There is a brand put
upon him—<hi>This is that King</hi> Ahaz, that
wicked King <hi>Ahaz,</hi> that reprobate
King <hi>Ahaz.</hi> As Pearls put in Vinegar
lose their colour and beauty, so many,
when under Gods hand, lose all their
glory and excellency, and begin to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strust
Gods Providence, to call his
justice into question, to murmure and
repine against Gods dealings, and to
use unlawful means for their delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.
Of these the Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi>
complains, <hi>Isa. 1. 5. Why should you bee
stricken any more? Yee will revolt more
and more;</hi> Such was <hi>Ahaziah,</hi> 2 King.
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:57918:43"/>
1, 2. that sought for help from <hi>Baal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zebub
the god of Ekron;</hi> and such was
<hi>Saul,</hi> who sought to the Witch of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor</hi>
for health in the day of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress.</p>
            <p>Both of <hi>these</hi> sorts are in a sad and
miserable condition; For God hath
<hi>two Furnaces,</hi> the <hi>Furnace of Affliction,</hi>
and the <hi>Furnace of Hell-fire.</hi> If the
first Furnace will not purge us, the
second will everlastingly consume us.
As the <hi>Roman Consuls</hi> had a man ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to go before them, carrying a
<hi>Rod,</hi> and an <hi>Axe;</hi> a <hi>Rod</hi> for the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>corrigible offenders,</hi> an <hi>Axe</hi> for
the destruction of <hi>incorrigible;</hi> So
God hath his <hi>Rod,</hi> and his <hi>Axe,</hi> his
<hi>Pruning knife,</hi> and his <hi>Chopping-knife,</hi>
his <hi>Warning-peeces,</hi> and his <hi>Murdering-peeces.</hi>
Afflictions are his <hi>Rods</hi> to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
us for our sin, his <hi>Pruning-knife</hi> to
pare off our luxuriant branches; his
<hi>Warning-peeces</hi> to call upon us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent.</p>
            <p>But if his <hi>Warning-peeces</hi> will do
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:57918:43"/>
us no good, wee must expect his <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering-peeces.</hi>
If his <hi>Pruning-knife</hi> will
not amend us, his <hi>Chopping-knife</hi> will
confound us. If his <hi>Rods</hi> will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
us, then his <hi>Axe</hi> will hew us
down, and cast us into everlasting fire.
God hath <hi>three houses,</hi> the <hi>house of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,</hi>
of <hi>Correction,</hi> and of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,</hi>
The place where Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
meet to hear his word, is his <hi>house</hi>
of <hi>Instruction.</hi> And if wee profit in this
house, hee will never carry us unto the
<hi>house of Correction.</hi> But if wee bee
stubborn and rebellious in the <hi>house of
Instruction,</hi> then hee will send us to
the <hi>house of Correction.</hi> And if wee
profit in this house, hee will never
send us into the <hi>house of Destruction.</hi>
But if wee continue incorrigible in the
<hi>house of Correction,</hi> hee will inevitably
send us to the <hi>house of Destruction,</hi> that
is, unto hell fire.</p>
            <p>And therefore whensoever God
brings us into the School of Affliction,
let us labour to bee good Schollars
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:57918:44"/>
in it; and to answer all those ends,
aimes, and designes which God hath in
afflicting of us. Let us pray to God
that our afflictions may bee <hi>Divine
Hammers</hi> to break our hearts for sin,
and from sin, may make the <hi>world bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
and <hi>Christ more precious,</hi> may <hi>prove</hi>
and <hi>improve</hi> our graces, and may put
an <hi>edge</hi> upon all holy duties.</p>
            <p>There are two things I would have
you in an especial manner to labour af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>1 Labour when afflicted,<note place="margin">Gods people are to labour to know the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Gods Rod</note> to know the
meaning of Gods Rod.</p>
            <p>2 That the good you get by afflictions,
may abide upon you after your recovery
from them.</p>
            <p>1 You must labour to <hi>know the
meaning of Gods Rod,</hi> and what the
<hi>particular arrant</hi> is, which hee hath to
you in the day of your distresses, you
must do as <hi>David</hi> did, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21. 1.
hee inquired of the Lord <hi>to know the
reason why hee sent a Famine amongst
them.</hi> So must you, you must pray
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:57918:44"/>
as <hi>Iob</hi> doth, <hi>Iob 10. 2. Shew mee, O
Lord, wherefore thou contendest with mee?</hi>
When the cause of a disease is found
out, it is half cured. Your great care
therefore must bee to study to know
the particular cause and reason, why
God turns your prosperity into ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity.
The Prophet <hi>Micah</hi> tells us,
<hi>Micah</hi> 6. 9. That the <hi>Rod hath a
voyce,</hi> and that the <hi>man of wisdome</hi> shall
see <hi>Gods Name upon it.</hi> There is a great
measure of spiritual Art and Wisdome
required, to inable a man to hear this
voyce, and to understand the language
of it. A spiritual Fool cannot do it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> What must wee do,<note place="margin">How wee may know the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Gods Rod</note> that wee
may understand the voyce of the Rod?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> You must know, that the Rod
of God ordinarily speaks <hi>three langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</hi>
it is sent for <hi>correction for sin,</hi> for
the <hi>trial and exercise of Grace,</hi> and for
<hi>instruction in holiness;</hi> Sometimes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
it is sent only for <hi>trial</hi> and <hi>instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi>
and not at all for sin. Upon this
account was <hi>Iob</hi> afflicted, and the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:57918:45"/>
blinde man, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 9. 3. But for the most
part it hath a <hi>threefold voyce;</hi> it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
for <hi>instruction, probation,</hi> and
also for <hi>correction,</hi> Lam. 3. 39. Isa. 42.

            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> How shall a man know whether
his afflictions bee only for <hi>trial and instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi>
and not at all for sin?</p>
            <p>Answ. <hi>The safest and best way for
a</hi> Christian <hi>in this case, is to beleeve
that all his afflictions are both for</hi> trial
<hi>and</hi> instruction, <hi>and also for</hi> sin: <hi>Indeed
when hee seeth another man, who is
very godly, grievously diseased, hee
may charitably beleeve, that this is for
his</hi> trial, <hi>and not for his</hi> sin; <hi>but when
it is his own case, then (as D.</hi> Ames <hi>saith
most excellently)</hi> Aequissimum, tutis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simum,
&amp; Deo gratissimum est, ut in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictionibus
omnibus peccata nostra intu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eamur,
quae illas vel directe procurarunt,
vel saltem promeruerunt. Quamvis enim
omnes afflictiones non immittantur sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
directè &amp; precipuè propter peccatum,
peccatum tamen est omnium afflictionum
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:57918:45"/>
fons &amp; fundamentum, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 12.—It
is most equal, most safe, and most acceptable
to God, to have an eye upon our sins, which
have either directly procured them, or at
least deserved them. <hi>For though</hi> afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are not alwayes sent directly and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
for sin, yet sin is the original and
foundation of all afflictions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> VVhat course must wee take to
finde out what that <hi>sin</hi> is in <hi>particular,</hi>
               <note place="margin">How to finde out the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular sin for which God af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts us.</note>
for which God corrects us?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Sometimes wee may <hi>read
our sin in our punishment. Adonibezek,</hi>
though a Heathen King, did this,
<hi>Iudg. 1. 7. Threescore and ten Kings,
having their Thumbs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and their great
Toes cut off, gathered their meat under
my table; as I have done, so God hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quited
mee.</hi> I read of holy <hi>Ephrem,</hi> that
hee was converted by the <hi>suitableness</hi>
of his <hi>affliction,</hi> unto the sin hee had
committed, for hee saw clearly that his
misery came not by chance, but from
God immediately, and for sin. As a
man may sometime gather the disease
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:57918:46"/>
of the Patient by observing the Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians
Bill, so hee may guess at his sin, by
considering his punishment.</p>
            <p>2 Consider what <hi>that sin</hi> is for
which they <hi>conscience</hi> doth most of all
accuse thee. Conscience is Gods Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerent,
his <hi>bosome Preacher.</hi> And when
wee sleight the <hi>voyce</hi> of Conscience,
God seconds it with the <hi>voyce</hi> of his
<hi>Rod,</hi> which speaks the very same lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
that <hi>Conscience</hi> doth.</p>
            <p>3 Consider what is <hi>the sin</hi> of thy
<hi>Complexion,</hi> and <hi>Constitution,</hi> what is
thy <hi>Dilectum delictum,</hi> thy <hi>peccatum in
deliciis,</hi> thy beloved sin, what is that
sin to which thou art most of all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined;
and if that sin prevaile over
thee, and thou canst not say with <hi>David
Psal.</hi> 18. 23. I have <hi>kept my self from
mine iniquity.</hi> It is very probable that
for the subduing of that sin, thou art
corrected of God.</p>
            <p>4 If ever thou hast been at the
<hi>gates of death,</hi> despairing of life, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
what <hi>that sin</hi> was, which did thee
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:57918:46"/>
most of all trouble and perplexe thy
conscience; or if ever thou hast been
in a <hi>dream,</hi> supposing thy self to bee
dying, and breathing out thy last; what
was that sinne which did then most
of all affright thee. It is very likely
that God by afflicting thee, intends to
get that sin more conquered and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified.</p>
            <p>5 Consider what those sins are for
which thy <hi>godly Minister</hi> (under whose
care thou livest) doth reprove thee, and
of which thy <hi>true</hi> and <hi>real friends</hi> do
accuse thee; for, if thou hast sleight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the <hi>voyce</hi> of thy faithful Minister,
and friends; surely <hi>God</hi> out of his love
to thee, followeth their advice with
the <hi>voyce</hi> of his Rod, that thereby hee
may open thine ear to Discipline, and
command thee to depart from those
iniquities.</p>
            <p>But if thou canst not finde out that
<hi>particular sin,</hi> for which God afflicts
thee, labour to repent of every sin,
and then thou wilt bee sure to repent
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:57918:47"/>
of that sin. If thou canst not finde
out the <hi>Bee</hi> that stings thee, pull
down the <hi>whole Hive,</hi> or the <hi>thorn</hi> that
<hi>pricks</hi> thee, pull down the <hi>whole Hedge.</hi>
Do that out of wisdome, which <hi>Herod</hi>
did out of malice, who because hee
could not finde out the <hi>Babe Iesus,
killed all the children in Bethlehem from
two years old, and under, that so hee
might bee sure to' kill Iesus.</hi> Let us
seek the utter ruine and death of all
our sins, and then wee shall bee sure to
destroy that sin for which God afflicts
us, and when the cause is removed,
the disease will forthwith bee cured,
and the Almighty pacified, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled
unto us.</p>
            <p>2 Let us <hi>labour that the good wee reap
by our afflictions,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The good we get by our Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main with us after our reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.</note> 
               <hi>may abide upon us after,
our recovery from them.</hi> There are
very many who while they are under
the Rod, seem to bee very penitent,
and do purpose and promise to amend
their lives, but as soon as the Rod is
removed, they returne like the Dog
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:57918:47"/>
to the vomit, &amp;c. Such was <hi>Pharaoh,</hi>
whilst he was plagued he confessed his
sin, and prayed for pardon, but as soon
as ever the judgement was gone, hee
hardened his heart. Such were the Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites.
<hi>Psal. 78. 34, 35, 36, 37. They were
not stedfast, they turned back.</hi> Just like a
truantly School-boy, who while his
Master is whipping him, will promise
any thing, but when it is done, forgets
presently to doe what hee promised:
Or like unto <hi>water,</hi> which while it is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the fire is <hi>very hot,</hi> but as soon as
ever it is taken off the fire, presently
groweth cold. I knew a man who in
the time of his <hi>sickness</hi> was so <hi>terrified</hi>
in his conscience for his sins, that hee
made the very bed to shake upon which
hee lay, and cried out all night long,
<hi>I am damned, I am damned,</hi> and made
many and great Protestations of amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of life, if God would bee pleased
to recover him. In a little while hee
did recover, and being recovered, was
as bad, and as wicked as ever before.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:57918:48"/>
And therefore let us labour that
the good wee get by our afflictions,
may not <hi>vanish away</hi> with our afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
but may <hi>abide</hi> on us after wee are
recovered, that wee may bee able to
say with <hi>David, It is good for mee that I
was afflicted,</hi> not onely that <hi>I am,</hi> but
that <hi>I was. David</hi> praiseth God in
health, for the good hee had got in
sickness, and which still <hi>abode</hi> with
him. Let us say with the same Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
<hi>Psal. 66. 13, 14. I will go into thy
house with burnt offerings, I will pay thee
my vows which my lips have uttered, and
my mouth hath spoken, when I was in
trouble.</hi> Let us pray unto God that
his afflictions may not onely <hi>skin</hi> over
our <hi>spiritual diseases,</hi> and <hi>coup</hi> up our
sins, but <hi>mortifie</hi> them, and so <hi>change</hi>
our natures, that wee may never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to folly.</p>
            <p>I will conclude this point with a
famous saying of <hi>Plinius secundus,</hi>
worthy to bee written in letters of
gold. A friend writes to him, and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:57918:48"/>
intreats him to give him advice how to
frame his life, so as hee might live as
becomes a good man. Hee returns him
this answer: I will not prescribe many
rules, there is this one only which I
commend to thee above all other. <hi>Ut
tales esse perseveremus sani, quales nos
futuros profitemur infirmi.</hi> Let us <hi>labour
to continue and persevere to bee such, when
wee are well, as wee purpose, and promise
to our selves to bee, when wee are sick.</hi>
There is hardly any man so wicked,
but hee will in sickness make many
and great promises of a new life, and
of universal reformation if God would
restore him. Now then if we not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>bee such,</hi> but <hi>continue</hi> to bee such
when restored, as wee promise to bee
when sick, then wee shall bee <hi>excellent
Schollars,</hi> in the School of Affliction,
and God will either (as I have already
said) deliver us out of <hi>affliction,</hi> or send
us to heaven by <hi>affliction.</hi> So much
for the first Truth supposed.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>That the Word of God
is the Saints darling, and
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:57918:50"/>
delights;</hi> not onely their <hi>delight,</hi> but in
the plural number, their <hi>delights,</hi> that
is (as our <hi>Annotations</hi> say) a Saint doth
greatly delight in Gods Law, or as
<hi>Iunius;</hi> All the delight of a Saint is
in Gods Law, Gods word is the center
of his delights, <hi>Nisi lex tun erat omuit
oblectatio mea,</hi> Many were the troubles
and sorrows of <hi>Davids</hi> life, but against
them all hee found as many comforts
and delectations in Gods Word,
therefore hee saith, vers. 29. <hi>Thy Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies
are my delights, &amp;c.</hi> and 143.
<hi>Trouble and anguish have taken hold on
mee, yet thy Commandements are my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights:</hi>
And in the Text, <hi>Unless thy
Law had been my delights, &amp;c.</hi> Whilst
others delight in vanity and iniquity,
whilst others take pleasure in hunting,
hawking, carding, dicing, eating, and
drinking, the Saints of God, can say
with <hi>Austin,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Reasons why the Saints take so much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in Gods Law</note> 
               <hi>Sacr a Scripturae tuae sunt
sanctae dellctae meae, Thy holy Scriptures
are my holy delights.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> Why do the Saints of God take
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:57918:50"/>
such delight in the Law of God?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Because they are <hi>spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
inlightned;</hi> their eyes are opened
to behold the glory and beauty, and
to understand the deep mysteries of
the Law, therefore <hi>David</hi> prayeth,
vers 18. <hi>Open thou mine eyes, that I
may behold wondrous things out of thy
Law,</hi> As the Apostle saith of the Jews,
2 <hi>Cor. 3. 14, 15, 16. That to this day
there is a vail over their hearts, when</hi>
Moses <hi>is read, and when they shall turn
to the Lord, this vail shall bee removed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
So it is with Christians, when a <hi>wicked
man</hi> reads the word, there is a <hi>vail</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
his <hi>eyes,</hi> and over his <hi>heart,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the <hi>Scriptures, The god of this world
hath so blinded his eyes,</hi> that hee cannot
behold the beauty and glory of them;
but the <hi>true Saint</hi> hath this vail re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved,
Christ hath anointed his eyes
with his <hi>spiritual eye-salve;</hi> hee seeth a
surpassing excellency in the Word of
God, and therefore cannot but delight
in it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:57918:51"/>
2 Because they are not onely <hi>il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned,</hi>
but <hi>regenerated;</hi> And as chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
new born by the <hi>instinct of nature,</hi>
have a natural appetite to milk for
conservation of their life; so the new
born Saint, by the <hi>instinct of grace,</hi> hath
a spiritual appetite to the Word of
God, according to that of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi>
1 Pet. 2. 2. <hi>As new borne babes desire
the sincere Milk of the VVord, that you
may gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>w thereby:</hi> The Word of God
is the Saints food, and as it is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
for a childe unborn to desire food,
so for a man unregenerated to hunger
after, and take true pleasure in the
Word; and as it is impossible for a
new born child, not to delight in Milk,
so it is as impossible for a regenerate
Christian, not to delight in the Law of
God.</p>
            <p>3 Because a true Saint hath the
Law of God <hi>written in his heart,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to that precious promise of the
Covenant of grace, <hi>Ier. 31. 33. I will
put my Law in their inward parts, and
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:57918:51"/>
write it in their hearts.</hi> A Saints heart
is the counterpane to Gods Law. The
Law is within his heart, <hi>Psal.</hi> 40. 8. and
as it is in the Hebrew, in the midst of
his bowels, <hi>in medio viscerum.</hi> God
hath infused a principle of grace into
his inward parts, whereby hee is not
onely <hi>inclined,</hi> but <hi>inabled</hi> to walk in
all the Commandements of the Law
blameless. A true Saint hides the Law
in his heart, as a <hi>choice Iewel</hi> in a most
<hi>precious Cabinet,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> saith, vers. 9.
<hi>I have hid thy Law in my heart.</hi> Hid it
as a rare treasure. So doth every Saint,
and therefore cannot but delight in
it.</p>
            <p>4 Because the same <hi>holy Spirit</hi> that
wrote the word, <hi>dwelleth in every true
Saint.</hi> It is certain that all Scripture is
of <hi>Divine Inspiration,</hi> and that the
<hi>holy men of God spake as they were
guided by the Holy Ghost.</hi> And it is as
certain, That the same Holy Ghost
dwelleth in every Saint, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 11.
And by vertue of the in-dwelling of
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:57918:52"/>
the Spirit, they are sweetly and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
drawn to make the Law of God
their chiefest delight.</p>
            <p>5 Because it is <hi>Gods inditement, and
invention.</hi> This reason is brought in
the Text, <hi>Unless thy Law, &amp;c.</hi> It is the
Law of that <hi>God</hi> in whom they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light.
It transcribes the <hi>minde</hi> and
<hi>heart</hi> of God. A true Saint seeth the
<hi>Name, Authority, Power, Wisdome,</hi>
and <hi>Goodness</hi> of God in every lett<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
of it, and therefore cannot but take
pleasure in it. It is an Epistle sent
down to him from the God of heaven.
It is one of the greatest <hi>Love-token<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi>
that ever <hi>God</hi> gave to his Church.
There are two great Gifts that <hi>God</hi>
hath given to his people. The <hi>Word
Christ,</hi> and the <hi>Word of Christ.</hi> Both
are unspeakably great. But the first
will do us no good without the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond.</p>
            <p>6 A true Saint cannot but delight
in the word of God, because it is his
<hi>inheritance,</hi> vers. 111. <hi>Thy testimonies
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:57918:52"/>
have I taken as an heritage for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ver
for they are the rejoycing of my heart.</hi>
Therefore they were the rejoycing of
his heart, because they were his ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
Inheritance.</p>
            <p>7 Because hee findes a <hi>sweetness in
i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</hi> Delight is nothing else but a pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n
of the soul, arising from th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
sweetness of the object that wee enjoy.
Things that are good, present, suitable,
and sweet, are the object of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights,
such is the word of God to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
true Saint. It is <hi>sweeter than the
h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ny, and the hony-comb,</hi> Psal. 19. 10.
So also <hi>Psal. 119. 103. How sweet are
thy words unto my taste, yea sweeter than
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ony to my mouth.</hi> A Saint must needs
delight in it, it is so suitable, and so
sweet.</p>
            <p>8 Because he <hi>loves the Law.</hi> Now
that which wee love, wee cannot but
delight in, when wee come to enjoy it.
A true Saint doth not onely love the
Law, but hee loves it exceedingly,
<hi>Psal. 119. 167. My soul hath kept thy
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:57918:53"/>
testimonies, and I love them exceedingly.</hi>
A true Saint can say with <hi>David,</hi>
Psal. 119. 97. <hi>Oh how do I love thy Law!</hi>
and vers. 127. <hi>I love thy Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
above gold, yea above fine gold:</hi>
And vers. 72. <hi>The Law of thy mouth is
better to mee than thousands of gold and
silver.</hi> Now because the Saints of God
are so inamoured with the Law of
God, therefore it is, that they cannot
but delight in it, as <hi>David</hi> saith, <hi>Psal.
119. 47. I will delight my self in thy
Commandements, which I have loved<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
Hee that loves the Commandements
(as all Saints do) cannot but delight in
them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Use.</hi> This shews that there are but
few <hi>true Saints</hi> amongst us. There
are many <hi>bastard Saints,</hi> and <hi>nomin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>l
Saints,</hi> but few true and real Saints.
Wee live in an age, wherein there
were never <hi>more</hi> Saints, and never
<hi>fewer,</hi> never more by <hi>outward Profession,</hi>
and never fewer by a <hi>holy Conversation.</hi>
It is the property of a true Saint to
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:57918:53"/>
make the word of God his darling
and delights.</p>
            <p>But where shall wee finde such
Saints? It is easie to finde out men
that can say, <hi>Eating and drinking is my
delight, carding and dicing is my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,
reading of vain and trifling
books is my delight, to satisfie the lusts
of the flesh is my delight.</hi> But where
is the man that can truly say as <hi>David</hi>
doth? <hi>The Law of God is my delights,
and the joy and rejoycing of my heart
for ever. Austin</hi> professeth of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
that before <hi>his Conversion,</hi> hee
took no pleasure in the Word of God.
His proud heart (as hee saith) would
not stoop to the humble expressions
of it. After <hi>his Conversion,</hi> hee was
ravished with the beauty and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
of the Scriptures, but before his
Conversion, hee saw no excellency in
them. <hi>Politian</hi> (though a great Schollar,
yet a notorious Atheist) professeth
most blasphemously, that hee never
lost more time than in reading the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:57918:54"/>
Scripture. And it is reported of <hi>Plato,</hi>
that when hee had read the first Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of <hi>Genesis,</hi> hee said, <hi>Hic vir multa
dicit, sed nihil probat:</hi> This man saith
many things, but proveth nothing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Where shall wee finde the man that
puts a due estimation upon the word
of God? That prizeth it <hi>above gold,
yea above much fine gold? That rejoyceth
in thy word, as much as in all riches,</hi>
verse 14. That can appeal to God,
and say as <hi>David,</hi> vers. 159. <hi>Consider,
Oh Lord, how I love thy Precepts?</hi> and
vers. 97. <hi>Oh how do I love thy Law?</hi>
There are some men that can delight
in any thing but in God, and his Word,
and his Ordinances: They can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in the creatures of God, but can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
delight in the Ordinances of God.
They can delight in the gifts of God,
in riches, and health, and honours:
But they cannot delight in the God of
these gifts. They can delight in books
of Philosophy, and Humanity, but
they cannot delight in the word of
God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:57918:54"/>
Mark the sad condition that these
are in.</p>
            <p>It is a certain sign that there is a
<hi>vail</hi> over their eyes and hearts, that
they are not yet <hi>anointed</hi> with <hi>Christs
eye-salve,</hi> that the God of the world
hath blinded their eyes, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
see the glorious excellencies of
the Law of God.</p>
            <p>It is certain, that they are not <hi>born
anew,</hi> for if they were new born babes,
they would desire the sincere milk of
the word.</p>
            <p>It is certain, that the <hi>Law of God</hi> is
not yet <hi>written in their hearts,</hi> and that
the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> doth not dwell in
them. It is certain, that they have no
part, nor portion in the word of God,
that they never tasted the sweetness
that is in it, and that they have no true
love to God, nor to his word. It is
a true saying, <hi>Qui regem amat,
legem amat,</hi> hee that loves a <hi>King,</hi>
will love his <hi>Law.</hi> And I may say,
<hi>Qui Deum amat, legem Dei amat:</hi> Hee
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:57918:55"/>
that loves <hi>God,</hi> will love the <hi>Law of
God,</hi> which is nothing else but <hi>his
Image,</hi> and <hi>his Picture,</hi> his <hi>last Will</hi> and
<hi>Testament,</hi> his <hi>blessed Love-token.</hi> And
therefore if you delight not in the <hi>Law
of God,</hi> it is evident you do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in the <hi>God of this Law.</hi> And if
you delight not in <hi>God,</hi> hee will not
delight in you; unless it bee to
<hi>laugh at your destruction,</hi> as it is <hi>Prov. 1.
26.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> But how shall I know whether I do
delight in the Word of God, or no?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> You shall know it by these
notes.</p>
            <p>1 Hee that delights in Gods Law,
will bee very frequent in <hi>meditating
and reading</hi> of it, and very <hi>often</hi> in
<hi>speaking</hi> of it. Thus saith <hi>David,</hi>
Psal. 1. 2. <hi>His delight is in the Law of
the Lord, and therein hee will meditate
day and night.</hi> And <hi>Psalm. 119. 97. Oh
how do I love thy Law, it is my medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
all the day.</hi> So also vers. 15, 16.
23. Hee that takes pleasure in the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:57918:55"/>
Law, hee will bee often thinking of it,
as Christ saith, <hi>Matth. 6. 21. Where the
treasure is, there the heart will bee also:</hi>
If the word of God bee thy treasure,
thou wilt meditate on it, <hi>Cogitatione
crebrâ, longâ, &amp; profundâ.</hi> Thou wilt
<hi>frequently</hi> think of it, and when thou
beginnest to think of it, thou wilt <hi>dwell</hi>
upon the thought of it, as a Bee dwells
(as it were) upon the flower to suck
out the sweetness that is in it, and thou
wilt think of it with <hi>deep</hi> and <hi>serious</hi>
meditations and contemplations, thou
wilt <hi>dive</hi> into the unsearchable riches
and treasures that are in the Word.
And as thou wilt meditate on it, so
thou wilt bee often, and unwearisome
in reading and perusing of it, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursing
about it. A man that delights
in hunting, is never weary of talking
of hunting, and hee that delights in the
world, of speaking about the world;
and if you did delight in Gods word,
you would bee very frequent, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defatigable
in discoursing of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:57918:56"/>
2 If you delight in the <hi>Word of
God,</hi> you would delight in the <hi>Ministers
and Ambassadors</hi> of the Word, law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
commissionated by Christ: For
the great work of the Ministry is to
expound and apply the Word; and
therefore if you dis-respect the godly,
learned, lawful Ministry of the Word,
you take no delight in the Word.</p>
            <p>3 They that delight in the Word,
will bee at <hi>any cost</hi> to bring the Word
to their Congregations, they will part
with thousands of gold and silver, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than with the word; <hi>He that esteems
the Word above thousands, will bee wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to part with hundreds for the Words
sake.</hi> Hee will account a famine of the
Word more bitter than a famine of
bread; by how much the <hi>soul</hi> is better
than the <hi>body,</hi> by so much will hee bee
more troubled for a <hi>soul-famine,</hi> than
a <hi>bodily.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4 Hee that delights truely in the
Law, will sincerely labour to <hi>obey it,</hi> and
bee m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ch <hi>grieved</hi> when it is disobey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:57918:56"/>
1 Hee will sincerely labour to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
it, hee will make the Word of
God the man of his counsel, vers. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>4.
<hi>Thy testimonies are my delight,</hi> but how
doth hee prove that? in the following
words, <hi>and my counsellors:</hi> Hee will
make the Word a <hi>Lamp to his feet, and
a light to his paths,</hi> vers. 105. In all his
undertakings, hee will inquire what
<hi>God</hi> would have him to do, and hee
will make Gods Word his <hi>Compass</hi> to
sail by, and pray with <hi>David,</hi> vers. 35.
<hi>Make mee to go in the path of thy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements,
for therein do I delight.</hi>
2 Hee will bee much grieved when o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
transgress the Law of God.
Thus <hi>David,</hi> vers. 53. <hi>Horror hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
hold upon mee, because of the wicked
that forsake thy Law,</hi> and vers. 136. <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of waters run down mine eyes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they keep not thy Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore you that delight in
sin, you cannot bee said to delight in
the Word; and you that are not pained
and grieved when others sin, you are
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:57918:57"/>
not amongst the number of those that
take pleasure in Gods Law, or in whom
God takes pleasure.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Use</hi> 2. Let us make it appear that
wee are <hi>Saints in deed, and in truth,</hi> not
only Saints in <hi>Mans,</hi> but in <hi>Gods Calen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
by following the example of holy
<hi>David,</hi> set down in the Text. Let us
make the Law of God our joyes, and
our delights. Let mee speak to you
in the words of the Apostle, <hi>Col. 3. 16.
Let the Word of God dwell richly in
you, &amp;c.</hi> not onely <hi>with you,</hi> but <hi>in you.</hi>
And in the Words of Christ, <hi>Ioh. 5.
39. Search the Scriptures, for therein
you hope to finde eternal life.</hi> The Greek
word signifieth to search, as men do
under ground for treasures, or to search
as men who dive under water for some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that is at the bottome. Let us
with <hi>Iob 23. 12. Esteem the ward of
God above our necessary food.</hi> Let us
love <hi>it above gold, yea above fine gold;</hi>
Let it bee <hi>dearer to us than thousands of
gold and silver, sweeter than the hony
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:57918:57"/>
and the honey-comb.</hi>

               <hi>Quest.</hi> May not a wicked man delight
in the VVord of God? Is it not said of
<hi>Herod,</hi> Mark. 6. 20. that hee heard <hi>John
Baptist</hi> gladly, and of the stony ground,
<hi>Luke</hi> 8. 13. that it received the <hi>Word
with joy?</hi> Is it not said of the Israelites
remaining wicked, that they <hi>delighted to
know Gods wayes, and took delight in
approaching to God,</hi> Isa. 58. 2. and of
the Iews, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 35. that they were wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<hi>for a season to rejoyce in the Light<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
held forth by the preaching of <hi>John Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:57918:58"/>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> There is a wide and vast dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
between the joy and delight
which a true Saint takes in Gods
Word, and that which may bee found
in an hypocrite.</p>
            <p>1 The delight of a godly man, is <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
and seasonable.</hi> It is the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
of conviction and humiliation;
For though <hi>Ioy</hi> bee the great work
of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> yet it is not the first work.
First, The <hi>Spirit</hi> by the Word con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinceth
and humbleth, and then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forteth;
therefore Christ saith, <hi>Mat. 5. 4.
Blessed are those that mourn, for they shall
bee comforted;</hi> and <hi>David</hi> saith, <hi>Psal.
126. 5. They that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ow in tears, shall
reap in joy.</hi> But the joy of an hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite
is <hi>unseasonable and disorderly.</hi> It is
his first work. It is said of the stony
ground, that when <hi>they heard the word,
they received it immediately with glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
Mark. 4. 16. It is not said, they
received it <hi>first</hi> with sorrow, and then
with gladness. Here is mention of
joy without any antecedent humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:57918:59"/>
Nay, the Text saith expresly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <hi>Luke 8. 6. it lacked moisture,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it withered away. There are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Professors in our dayes that <hi>skip</hi>
from sin, to joy at first, that all in an
instant are in the <hi>highest form</hi> of sin,
and in the <hi>highest form</hi> of comfort,
that skip out of the <hi>lap</hi> of the Devil,
into the <hi>lap</hi> of joy: These are as the
stony ground. These are <hi>wanton Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians;</hi>
They <hi>sow</hi> before they <hi>plough;</hi>
They know not the bitterness of sin,
and therefore in time of temptation
fall away.</p>
            <p>2 The delight that a godly ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
takes in the Word, is a well-rooted
delight. It is rooted in an <hi>humble, good,</hi>
and <hi>honest heart,</hi> as is said of the good
ground, <hi>Luke</hi> 8. 15. But the delight of
an hypocrite is <hi>shallow and superficial;</hi>
as his graces are sleight and formal, so
are his delights. Therefore it is said
of the seed that fell upon the stony
ground, that it had <hi>no root,</hi> Luke 8. 13.
and <hi>Matth. 13. 5. it wanted depth of
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:57918:59"/>
earth,</hi> and therefore when the Sun a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rose,
it was scorched. The Apostle
hints this, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 4.—and have <hi>tasted</hi>
the good Word of God. The delight
of a wicked man in the Word, is but a
<hi>tasting, and sipping,</hi> no <hi>soaking,</hi> a float<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a loft in the River of Christs blood,
no diving down to the bottome. A
man may taste a thing, and not like it,
taste, and <hi>like it,</hi> and yet not come up
to the price of it, as the <hi>young man,</hi>
Matth. 19. 22. Hee was very desirous to
injoy eternal life, but hee would not
part with his possessions for the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it. A Cook tasteth of the
meat hee dresseth, but they onely that
are invited eat of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tasting</hi> doth not imply <hi>habitual
grace.</hi> A man may taste that which
hee never digesteth, nor concocteth.
The Israelites tasted of the first
fruits of the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and yet
did not enter into <hi>Canaan.</hi> Such is the
joy of the hypocrite. It is <hi>outward</hi> and
<hi>superficial;</hi> But the delight of a true
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:57918:60"/>
Saint is <hi>inward, solid, and substantial.
Ieremy</hi> saith, that the Word of God
was the <hi>joy and rejoycing of his heart,</hi>
and that hee did eat it, <hi>Ier.</hi> 15. 16. hee
did not onely taste it, but eat it. And
<hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>Rom. 7. 22. I delight in the
Law of God after the inner man;</hi> His de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
had depth of earth, they were
well digested and concocted.</p>
            <p>3 It is <hi>superlative and over-topping.</hi>
A godly man delighteth more in God
and his Word, than in any worldly
thing whatsoever. <hi>Lord lift thou up</hi>
(saith <hi>David,</hi> Psal. 4. 6, 7.) <hi>the light of
thy countenance upon us, thou hast put
gladness in my heart, more than in the
time that their corn<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and their wine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased.</hi>
So also <hi>Psal. 43. 4.—Unto God
my exceeding joy,</hi> Psal. 137. 6. <hi>If I prefer
not Ierusalem above my chief joy.</hi> And
<hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 72. 127. The delight of a Saint
in Gods Word over-toppeth all his
creature-delights, and injoyments, and
for the joy hee findes in it, <hi>hee will sell
all hee hath to purchase it,</hi> Mat. 13. 44.
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:57918:60"/>
But the joy of a wicked man is of an
<hi>inferiour nature,</hi> hee rejoyceth more in
<hi>Corn, Wine,</hi> and <hi>Oyl, &amp;c.</hi> And when it
comes into competition, hee will leave
his <hi>spiritual</hi> and <hi>heavenly,</hi> rather than
lose his <hi>creature</hi> and <hi>carnal pleasures.</hi>
Thus <hi>Herod</hi> rejoyced in the word that
<hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> preached, but hee rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
more in his <hi>Herodias,</hi> and when it
came to the trial, hee chose to behead
<hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> rather than to part with
<hi>Herodias.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The stony ground, when persecution
arose, parted with all its joy, and faith,
rather than it would lose its estate,
or life. As a godly man <hi>rejoyceth in
worldly things, as though hee rejoyced
not,</hi> 1 Cor. 7. 30. So a wicked man <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyceth
in spiritual things, as though
hee rejoyced not.</hi> In the old Law
those <hi>Fowls</hi> that did both <hi>flye</hi> and
<hi>swimme,</hi> were unclean: A wicked man
would many times <hi>flye aloft in spiritual
delights,</hi> but hee would also <hi>bathe</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and <hi>swimme</hi> in carnal pleasures,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:57918:61"/>
and his heart is more affected with
worldly advancement, and bodily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations,
than with heavenly, and this
is a sign that hee is an <hi>unclean Christian,</hi>
and that his delights in God, and his
Word are not right, because they are
not <hi>overtopping</hi> and <hi>superlative.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4 It is <hi>powerful and soul-strengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
full of life, vigour, and activity; it
will inable the soul to do and suffer any
thing for God, it turns a <hi>Prison</hi> into a
<hi>Paradise,</hi> it makes <hi>Martyrdome</hi> to bee
as a <hi>bed of Roses,</hi> it is <hi>Armour of proof</hi>
to steel us, and make us fit to indure
Afflictions, both for God, and from
God; therefore <hi>David</hi> saith in the
Text, <hi>Unless thy Law had been my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights,
I should then have perished in mine
Affliction.</hi> His delight in the Law sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
him from sinking. It is like <hi>Oyl</hi>
to the <hi>Wheels,</hi> like <hi>Sails</hi> to the <hi>Ship,</hi> and
<hi>wings</hi> to the <hi>bird;</hi> but the delight that a
wicked man hath in the Word is a <hi>pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erless,
dead, fruitless,</hi> and <hi>strengthless</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light.
It is as a <hi>paper Helmet,</hi> and a
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:57918:61"/>
               <hi>painted fire,</hi> it will not support him in
the hour of adversity: The persons re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
by the stony ground, fell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
notwithstanding their joy, as soon
as ever persecution arose for the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel.
But the joy of a true Saint is <hi>soul-supporting,</hi>
and <hi>soul-upholding. The joy
in the Lord is their strength,</hi> Neh. 8. 10.</p>
            <p>5 The delight that a godly man
hath in the Word, is <hi>sin-excluding.</hi> It
cannot consist with a delight in any sin;
therefore <hi>David</hi> saith, <hi>Psal. 119. 11.
Thy Word have I hid in my heart, that
I might not sinne against thee.</hi> Sinne is
as a <hi>wooden window,</hi> to shut out the
true joyes of the Spirit. But now a
wicked man, though hee may delight
in the <hi>Word,</hi> yet hee also delights in
<hi>sinning against the Word.</hi> Although
<hi>Herod</hi> heard <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> gladly, yet
hee kept his <hi>Herodias;</hi> and though the
Israelites delighted to <hi>know Gods wayes,</hi>
yet they did not <hi>delight to walk in his
wayes.</hi> They were <hi>as a Nation</hi> that
did righteousness, hee doth not say,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:57918:62"/>
they were such, but <hi>quasi gens, &amp;c. as
a Nation</hi> that did righteousness. And
though they <hi>delighted to approach to
God,</hi> yet they did not delight to <hi>obey</hi>
that God before whom they approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched;
they took pleasure in sinning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
God, as well as in serving of
God, <hi>Isa.</hi> 58. It was not a <hi>sin-exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi>
joy, and therefore it was false and
counterfeit.</p>
            <p>6 It is <hi>grace-increasing.</hi> The more
a Saint delights in the <hi>Word of God,</hi>
the more careful hee will bee to obey
the <hi>Will of God,</hi> and to grow and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
in the grace of God; therefore
<hi>David</hi> saith, <hi>Psal. 119. 167. My soul
hath kept thy testimonies, for I love them
exceedingly.</hi> And <hi>Psal. 40. 8. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
to doe thy Will, O my God, yea thy
Law is within my heart;</hi> because the
Law was written in his heart, therefore
hee delighted to doe it. Hee that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
to keep Gods Law, God will
give him more grace to keep it accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to that remarkable text, <hi>Psal. 119.
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:57918:62"/>
55, 56. I have remembred thy Name, O
Lord, and have kept thy Law, this I had,
because I have kept thy Precepts.</hi> What
had <hi>David</hi> for keeping Gods Precepts?
Hee had power to keep his Law; that
is, to grow and increase in keeping of it.
As the Prophet, <hi>Hos.</hi> 6. 3. speaks of the
knowledge of God. <hi>Then shall wee
know, if wee follow on to know the Lord,</hi>
that is, if wee industriously labour to
know God, wee shall have this reward,
to bee made able to know him more.
So may I say of the grace of God. <hi>Hee
that delights to keep Gods Law, shall have

            </p>
            <p>A true delight in Gods Word is
<hi>Grace increasing.</hi> Grace is the <hi>Mother</hi>
of all true joy, <hi>Isa.</hi> 32. 17. and joy is as
the <hi>Daughter,</hi> and the Mother and
Daughter live and dye together.
True, spiritual delight, ebbs and flows
as grace ebbs and flows. As the wood
is to the fire, oyl to the flame, the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
to the body, so is joy to grace.

            <p>An hypocrite is <hi>all joy,</hi> and <hi>no grace;</hi>
a <hi>Giant</hi> in joy, and not so much as a

            <p>7 The delight that a godly man
hath in the word, is not onely a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light

A wicked man may follow a

<hi>Herod, to hear Iohn Baptist

many things,</hi> that so hee might hold

him asleep in presumption, and by his
good things hee might quiet his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
and put a fair gloss upon his
incestuous practices: A man may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
in spiritual things upon sinful
grounds and reasons. But now a true
<hi>Saint delights</hi> in the <hi>word</hi> upon a <hi>spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
account,</hi> because it is <hi>Gods word,</hi> and
<hi>God</hi> would have him <hi>delight in it,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is his <hi>guide to glory,</hi> the way by
which he is sanctified. It is both <hi>concha

<hi>mysteries</hi> of <hi>salvation,</hi> and a <hi>Conduit</hi>

            <p>In a word, hee delights in it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is <hi>holy and pure,</hi> hee can say
with <hi>David,</hi> Psal. 119. 140. <hi>Thy word
is very pure, therefore thy servant loveth

say.</p>
            <p>8 The delight that a godly man
takes in the word, is without any <hi>reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi>

and <hi>threatning</hi> word, as well as in

the <hi>promising</hi> word; he beholds God,

the Lord.</hi> Hee hath the <hi>whole Law</hi> writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in his heart, and rejoyceth in every

delight in the <hi>promising</hi> word, but hee
undervalues the <hi>commanding</hi> word,
and turneth a deaf ear to the <hi>threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi>

but it is not said, They <hi>rejoyced in
his heat:</hi> Hee was a <hi>burning,</hi> and a

<hi>Iob</hi> 27. 8. Therefore it is said of the

Hee may rejoyce in the word

            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. You must seriously study
the <hi>excellency of Gods word,</hi> this made
<hi>David</hi> prize it so much, and love it so
much, <hi>Psal.</hi> 19. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. The

and therefore must needs bee full of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
<hi>wisdome</hi> and <hi>eloquence,</hi> even the
<hi>wisdome,</hi> and <hi>eloquence of God.</hi> There
is not a <hi>word</hi> in it, but <hi>breathes</hi> out
<hi>God,</hi> and is <hi>breathed</hi> out by <hi>God.</hi>
It is (as <hi>Ireneus</hi> saith) <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
an invariable rule of faith, an
unerring and infallible guide to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
It contains glorious revelations
and discoveries, no where else to bee
found. It hath a <hi>manifesting, convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing,
soul-humbling, soul-directing, soul-converting,</hi>
and <hi>soul-comforting</hi> power,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:57918:66"/>
and efficacy in it, as appears by these
Scriptures, <hi>Heb. 4. 12. 1 Cor. 14. 24, 25.
1 King. 21. 29. Psalm 119. 105. 2 Cor.
3. 6. Psalm</hi> 119. 50. And therefore to
delight in the Word, and the God that
made it, is not only our <hi>duty,</hi> Psa. 37. 4.
But it is recorded in Scripture as our
priviledge, and as the great reward that
God would bestow upon those that
keep holy the <hi>Sabbath-day,</hi> Isa. 58.
13, 14. <hi>Then thou shalt delight thy self
in the Lord.</hi> This shall bee thy great
reward.</p>
            <p>2 <hi>You</hi> must fixedly ponder the <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity</hi>
of practising this duty: For if
you delight in <hi>Gods Law,</hi> God will <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light</hi>
in you. If the Law bee your <hi>belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,</hi>
you are Gods <hi>beloved;</hi> If you
take no <hi>pleasure</hi> in his word, his soul
will take no <hi>pleasure</hi> in you.</p>
            <p>3 You must pray for the grace of
<hi>Illumination.</hi> Whensoever you take the
Bible in your hand to read in it, pray
<hi>Davids</hi> prayer, <hi>Psal. 119. 18. Open thou
mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:57918:66"/>
things out of thy Law.</hi> Philosophers
observe, that <hi>Lumen est vehiculum in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluentiae,</hi>
Light is the <hi>Chariot</hi> of <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence,</hi>
as it begets the flower in the
field, the gold in the Mineral; so the
<hi>foundation</hi> of all <hi>regeneration,</hi> is <hi>illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination.</hi>
Pray that God would open
your <hi>eyes</hi> that you may <hi>understand the
Scriptures,</hi> as hee did to his Apostles,
<hi>Luke</hi> 24. 45. That hee would take
away the <hi>vail</hi> that is upon your
hearts.</p>
            <p>4 Pray that he that made you <hi>crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi>
would make you <hi>new creatures,</hi>
that as <hi>new-born Babes</hi> you may desire
the sincere milk of the word.</p>
            <p>5 Pray that God would fulfill that
excellent promise, <hi>Ier.</hi> 31. 33. That
hee would put his <hi>Law</hi> in your <hi>inward
parts,</hi> and write it in <hi>your hearts,</hi> and
then you cannot but <hi>heartily</hi> delight
in it.</p>
            <p>6 Pray to God to give you the same
<hi>Spirit</hi> that wrote the word, to inable
you to delight in it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:57918:67"/>
7 Pray for a <hi>spiritual palate,</hi> that you
may not only delight in <hi>spiritual things,</hi>
but have a <hi>spiritual delight</hi> in <hi>spiritual</hi>
things. It is said of the Lioness, that
when shee hath once tasted of the
sweetness of mans flesh, shee is never
satisfied till shee hath more of it. Hee
that hath tasted of the good Word
of God, and not onely tasted, but
eaten it, and digested it into good
nourishment, hee will not onely delight
in it, but hee will delight in it above
gold, yea above fine gold, and hee will
never bee satisfied, till hee bee filled
with the fulness of that <hi>God</hi> that made
it.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ow I come to speak of the
Proposition that is clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
held forth in the Text.
Doct. 3. <hi>That the VVord
of God delighted in, is the
Afflicted Saints Antidote against ruine
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:57918:68"/>
and destruction.</hi> Unless thy Law had
been my delights, I should, &amp;c. The
Word of God is the <hi>sick Saints salve,
the dying Saints cordial;</hi> a most precious
medicine to keep Gods people from
perishing in time of affliction: This up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
<hi>Iacob</hi> from sinking when his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Esau</hi> came furiously marching to
destroy him, <hi>Gen. 32. 12. And thou
saidst I will surely do thee good, &amp;c.</hi> The
promise of God supported him. This
also upheld <hi>Ioshua,</hi> and inabled him
couragiously to fight the Lords bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels,
because God had said, <hi>Hee would
never leave him, nor for sake him,</hi> Josh.
1. 5. <hi>Melancthon</hi> saith, that the <hi>Lant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave</hi>
of <hi>Hessen</hi> told him at <hi>Dresda,</hi> that
it had been impossible for him to have
born up under the manifold miseries
of so long an imprisonment, <hi>Nisi habuis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set
consolationem ex Verbo divino in sua
corde,</hi> but for the comforts of the
Scriptures in his heart.</p>
            <p>There are eight things may bee said
(amongst many other) in commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:57918:68"/>
of the Word of God.</p>
            <p>1 It is the <hi>Magazin</hi> and <hi>Store-house</hi>
of all comfort and consolation. There
is no condition (but one) that a man
can be in, but hee may finde soul-sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting
comfort for it out of the
Word. Indeed if thou resolvest to go
on in sin, the Word cannot comfort
thee; it threatneth Hell and Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to all such. If the <hi>God of Heaven</hi>
can make such miserable, they shall
be miserable; But excepting this one,
there is no condition so miserable, but a
man may fetch a Cordial out of the
Word, to support him under it. Art
thou as <hi>empty</hi> of riches, and as <hi>full</hi> of
Diseases, as <hi>Iob</hi> under the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and <hi>Lazarus</hi> under the New
Testament? are the (sins-with which
thou art willing to part) many
and great? Is thy Conscience exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
wounded and disquieted? Doth
the Devil roar upon thee with hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
temptations? let thy condition be
never so sad, the Word of God is able
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:57918:69"/>
to afford thee comfort under it. For
it is the <hi>Word</hi> of that <hi>God,</hi> who is the
<hi>God of all consolation.</hi> There is no
kinde of true comfort, but here it is to
bee had, here are Cordials of all
sorts. Comforts under <hi>bodily troubles,</hi>
and comforts under <hi>soul-troubles.</hi> There
is no <hi>Monarch</hi> can furnish his table with
such variety of delicates, as <hi>God</hi> hath
furnished his <hi>Word</hi> with variety of
comforts.</p>
            <p>2 The Word of God is not only the
<hi>Magazine</hi> of all true comfort, but the
<hi>Fountain</hi> from whence it is derived.
All the comfort that you receive by
reading of good books, is fetched out
of this Book. All the refreshings that
the <hi>Ambassadors</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> administer
to you, are borrowed from this
<hi>Fountain.</hi> As the King of <hi>Israel</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
the woman (that cried out,
saying,<note place="margin">2 King. 6 26, 27.</note> 
               <hi>Help my Lord, O King) If the
Lord do not help thee, whence shall I help
thee?</hi> So will all the true Ministers of
Christ say to any distressed soul that
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:57918:69"/>
cries out for comfort: How can wee
comfort you, if the Word of God
doth not comfort you? All our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
must bee fetcht from thence.</p>
            <p>3 It will comfort us at <hi>such a time,</hi>
when no outward thing can comfort us.
And that is, when wee are under <hi>soul-agonies,</hi>
and when our soul sits upon
our lips; ready to depart, when wee
are sailing into the <hi>Ocean</hi> of <hi>Eternity;</hi>
then, even then, the promises of the
Word will comfort us: When gold
and silver, Father and Mother, Friends,
and Physitians are miserable comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
then will one <hi>promise</hi> out of the
Word fill us full of joy unspeakable,
and glorious.</p>
            <p>4 <hi>The Comforts of the Word exceed
all other Comforts,</hi> for <hi>they are pure, and
purifying, sure,</hi> and <hi>satisfying; they</hi> are
<hi>soul-supporting, soul-comforting,</hi> and
<hi>soul-ravishing, they</hi> are <hi>durable</hi> and <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting.</hi>
The comforts of the
world are not worthy to bee named
that day, in which wee speak of the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:57918:70"/>
comforts of the Word. They are not
<hi>consolationes,</hi> but <hi>consolatiunculae.</hi> At
best they are but <hi>bodily, unsatisfying,</hi>
and <hi>transitory.</hi> Many times they are sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
and soul-damning.</p>
            <p>5 The Word of God is not onely a
<hi>Magazine,</hi> and a <hi>Fountain</hi> of comfort,
but also a <hi>touchstone,</hi> by which wee
must try all our comforts whether
they bee true and real, or no. All joyes,
hopes, and assurances, must bee tryed
by the Word, and if not rightly groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
thereupon, are false, and soul-delusions.</p>
            <p>6 It is as an <hi>Apothecaries shop,</hi> or a
<hi>Physitians dispensatory,</hi> out of which
wee may fetch all manner of <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines,</hi>
to cure all the diseases of our
<hi>souls.</hi> Art thou spiritually lame,
blinde, or dumb? &amp;c. The Word
will open blinde eyes, make the dumb
to speak, and the lame to walk. If
dead in sins and trespasses, the Word,
when it is the sword of the Spirit, will
quicken thee. It is as a corrasive to
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:57918:70"/>
eat sin out of thy heart; therefore <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
saith, <hi>I have hid thy Word in mine
heart, that I might not sin against
thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>7 It is a <hi>spiritual Armory,</hi> out of
which wee may fetch all manner of
Weapons, to conquer the Devil, and
his temptations, 2 <hi>Corint.</hi> 10. 4. It is
that <hi>little Brook,</hi> out of which every
<hi>David</hi> may fetch <hi>five smooth stones</hi> to
destroy the Devil. These five smooth
stones, are five texts of Scripture,
three of these Christ took out of the
brook of the Word, by which he sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
the Devil, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. 4. 7, 10.</p>
            <p>8 It is the <hi>Sun of the Christian
VVorld.</hi> As the <hi>Sun</hi> is the <hi>light</hi> of the
<hi>Natural VVorld,</hi> and without it, the
World is but a Chaos, and a Dunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
full of darkness. So is the <hi>VVord of
God,</hi> the <hi>light</hi> of the <hi>spiritual world,</hi>
without which a Christian is under an
eternal night. Therefore <hi>David</hi> saith,
<hi>Thy VVord is a lamp unto my feet, and
a light unto my path,</hi> Psal. 119. 105.
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:57918:71"/>
What would all the World avail, if no
Sun to illighten it, and what comfort
would all the wealth of it afford us, if
no word to instruct, and counsel us?
For this is the Christians compass to
sail to Heaven by, his staffe to walk
withall to Heaven, his spiritual blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
to keep his soul from drowning.
The Cork, to keep up the net of his
soul from sinking. Afflictions are like
the <hi>lead</hi> of the Net, which weigheth
it down, but the <hi>Word</hi> is as the <hi>Cork,</hi>
which keeps it up, that it sinks not. So
saith <hi>David</hi> in the Text, <hi>Unless thy
Law had been my delights, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse.</hi> If the Word of God bee of

               <note place="margin">2 Vse.</note>
            </p>
            <p>1 Let us <hi>bless God</hi> exceedingly for
revealing his <hi>will</hi> unto us in the <hi>Word.</hi>
It was a great honour, and priviledge
to the <hi>Iews,</hi> that to them were <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
the Oracles of God,</hi> Rom. 3. 2.
And it is our great happiness that wee
have not only the same <hi>Oracles</hi> of <hi>God</hi>
               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:57918:71"/>
which they have, but an addition of
the New Testament, for the clearer
discoverie of the mysteries of salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

every <hi>crum</hi> of <hi>bread</hi> we eat, much more

bread of life,</hi> and the only food of our

only given us the book of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and the book of Nature to know
himself, and his will by, but also, and
especially the Book of the Scriptures,
whereby wee come to know those
things of <hi>God,</hi> and of <hi>Christ,</hi> which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Book of Nature, nor of the
creatures can reveal unto us.</p>
            <p>Let us <hi>bless God,</hi> not only for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing
his <hi>will</hi> in his <hi>VVord,</hi> but for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing
it by <hi>writing.</hi> Before the time
of <hi>Moses,</hi> God discovered his Will by
<hi>immediate revelations from Heaven.</hi> But
wee have a <hi>surer word of Prophecy,</hi>
a Pet. 1. 19. surer (to us) than a <hi>voyce
from Heaven;</hi> For the Devil (saith the
Apostle) <hi>transforms himself into an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:57918:72"/>
of light.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 11. 14.</note> Hee hath his <hi>apparitions,</hi>
and <hi>revelations,</hi> hee is <hi>Gods</hi> ape, and in
imitation of <hi>God,</hi> he appears to his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
and makes them beleeve it is
<hi>God</hi> that appears, and not the <hi>Devil.</hi>
Thus hee appeared to <hi>Saul</hi> in the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of <hi>Samuel.</hi> And if God should
now at this day discover his way of
worship, and his Divine Will by <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,</hi>
how easily would men bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
and mistake <hi>Diabolical delusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
for <hi>Divine Revelations;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let us <hi>blesse God</hi> for the <hi>written
word,</hi> which is <hi>surer and safer</hi> (as to us)
than an <hi>immediate Revelation.</hi> There are
some that are apt to think, that if an
Angel should come from Heaven, and
reveal Gods Will to them, it would
work more upon them than the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
word; but I would have these men
study the conference between <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
and <hi>Dives,</hi> Luke 16. 27, 28, 29,
30, 31. <hi>Habent Mosen &amp; Prophetas,
&amp;c. They have</hi> Moses <hi>and the Prophets,</hi>
if they will not profit by them, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:57918:72"/>
would they profit by any that
should come out of Hell, or down from
Heaven to them. For it is the same
<hi>God</hi> that speaks by his <hi>written Word,</hi>
and by a <hi>voyce from Heaven.</hi> The dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
is only in the <hi>outward cloathing;</hi>
and therefore if Gods speaking by
writing will not amend us. No more
will Gods speaking by a voyce. <hi>O
bless God exceedingly for the written
Word!</hi> Let us cleave close to it, and not
expect any <hi>Revelations from Heaven</hi> of
new truths, but say with the Apostle,
<hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 8, 9.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Use</hi> 2. Let us <hi>prize the word of God
above gold, yea above fine gold:</hi> Let us
read it, diligently, reverently, praying
to God to give us the <hi>same spirit,</hi> that
wrote it, to inable us to understand it,
and conscientiously to practise it. Let
us make it the joy and rejoycing of
our heart, and as it is in the Text; Let
us make it our <hi>Delights,</hi> but of this I
spake in the former point. The onely
motive I shall now use to perswade
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:57918:73"/>
you to make the Word your <hi>Delights,</hi>
shall bee this in the Text. Because it
will <hi>keep you from perishing in the time
of your greatest affliction.</hi> It will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
you when you have most need of
it (that is, under <hi>heart-sinking-afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
and at the <hi>hour of death)</hi> and it
will comfort you when all outward
comforts and creatures fail. It wil
bee food to strengthen your weake
Faith; Physick to cure the remainders
of corruptions, it will bee a Cordial
to revive your drooping spirits, and
fainting souls. It will make you more
than Conquerors over all temptations
and distresses.</p>
            <p>Quest. <hi>But now the great Question
is,</hi> How a childe of God ought to manage
and make use of the word of God, so as to
make it a Conduit of <hi>support</hi> and <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,</hi>
in the day of his greatest Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> To bee able to do this,
there is a great deal of spiritual wisdom
and understanding required. For the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:57918:73"/>
word to many people is like <hi>Sauls</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
to <hi>David,</hi> which was so cumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
to him, that hee could not wear
it.</p>
            <p>There are many know not how to
use the Word, so as to bee comforted
by it. As the woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> told
Christ, <hi>Ioh. 4. 11. The Well is deep, and
thou hast nothing to draw with.</hi> So may
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>I say, The <hi>word of God</hi> is a <hi>deep Well,</hi>
it is a <hi>Well of salvation,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isa. 4.</note> but it is <hi>deep,</hi>
and the <hi>deeper</hi> the <hi>sweeter,</hi> but most
people want <hi>Buckets</hi> to draw with,
they want a <hi>spiritual Art</hi> to fetch out of
these Wells of salvation, divine sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation
and consolation; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to help you in this great work you
must know,</p>
            <p>That the word of God may bee di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
into three parts;<note place="margin">The word of God divided into the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, threatning and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising Word.</note> Into <hi>Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements,
Threatnings,</hi> and <hi>Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses:</hi>
And though a <hi>Christian</hi> must not
neglect the <hi>commanding,</hi> and <hi>threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
word,</hi> yet if ever hee would make
the <hi>word a Channel of Divine comfort,</hi>
               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:57918:74"/>
hee must study the <hi>promising-word,</hi> for
the Promises are a Christians <hi>Magna
Charta</hi> for Heaven. All comfort must
bee built upon a Scripture promise,
else it is presumption, not true com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.
The Promises are <hi>pabulum fidei,
&amp; anima fidei,</hi> the food of faith, and
the soul of faith. As faith is the life
of a Christian, so the <hi>promises</hi> are the
life of <hi>Faith: Faith</hi> is a <hi>dead Faith,</hi> if
it hath no promise to quicken it; As
the <hi>Promises</hi> are of no use without
<hi>Faith</hi> to apply them, so <hi>Faith</hi> is of no
use without a <hi>Promise</hi> to lay hold on.
And the great reason why the people
of God walk uncomfortably in their
afflictions, is, because they do not <hi>chew</hi>
the <hi>Promises;</hi> they are <hi>rare Cordials,</hi> but
as a man cannot taste the <hi>sweetness</hi> of a
<hi>Cordial,</hi> unless hee <hi>chew</hi> it, no more
can wee receive any <hi>spiritual refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
from the <hi>Promises,</hi> unless wee
<hi>meditate</hi> on them. The promises are
as a <hi>Mine</hi> full of <hi>rich treasure,</hi> but as
Mines, unless wee digge deep into
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:57918:74"/>
them, wee can never get the gold and
silver hid in them: no more can wee
injoy the <hi>soul-ravishing</hi> comfort of the
<hi>promises,</hi> unlesse we <hi>digge</hi> into them by
a <hi>serious consideration</hi> of them. They
are as <hi>a garden</hi> full of <hi>rare flowers,</hi> able
to sweeten any condition. But because
wee doe not walk in this <hi>garden,</hi> and
pick out these flowers; hence it is that
wee live so <hi>disconsolately</hi> and dejectedly
under our afflictions. There are many
<hi>rare stories</hi> declaring the comfort that
some of Gods Saints have received
from the promises in the day of their
distresse. Mr. <hi>Bilney</hi> that blessed Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr
was much wounded in Conscience,
by reason of the great <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n hee commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
in subscribing to the Popish errors,
but hee was much comforted by read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
those words, 1 <hi>Tim. 1. 15. This is
a faithful saying, and worthy of all accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
that Iesus Christ came into the
VVorld to save sinners, of which I am the
chief. Beza</hi> was supported under his
troubles, by the words of Christ,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:57918:75"/>
               <hi>Iohn</hi> 10. 27, 28, 29. Mr. <hi>Bolton</hi> tells
us of one, that was upheld under great
affliction, and comforted from <hi>Isa. 26.
3.</hi> Of another, from <hi>Isa.</hi> 57. 15. I knew a
young maid that went triumphantly to
Heaven, by the refreshing shee found
in that well known Text, <hi>Matth. 11.
28.</hi> and many that have been wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
cheared by reading the eight
<hi>Chapter</hi> of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and by that
Text, 1 <hi>Ioh. 3. 14. VVee know that
wee have passed from death unto life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
wee love the Brethren.</hi> The truth
is, there is no promise, but if God bee
pleased to <hi>illighten it,</hi> and shew us our
interest in it, will afford a Harvest of
joy. It is with <hi>Promises,</hi> as it is with
<hi>Sermons:</hi> That <hi>Sermon</hi> which once
heard, did not at all work upon us, the
same Sermon heard at another time
may exceedingly affect us. And the
same Text of Scripture, which some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
doth not at all comfort us, may
at another time convey much comfort
to us. Two men troubled in conscience
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:57918:75"/>
may both of them read the same chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and hear the same Sermon, and one
of them may have his troubled minde
pacified, and the other continue
troubled, and the reason is, because the
Spirit of God makes the Word <hi>effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
to one, and not to the other.</hi> How
often hath a distressed Saint, read <hi>Mat.
11. 28. 1 Tim. 1. 15. Ioh. 10. 27, 28.
Isa. 26. 3. Isa. 57, 15. 1 Ioh.</hi> 3. 14. and
found no comfort in reading of them;
But if the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> did <hi>come in,</hi> and
open his eyes to behold the <hi>rich mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi>
wrapt up in these promises, and
<hi>his interest</hi> in them, they would fill him
with comfort above expression. And
therefore if ever you would make the
Word of God, Gods instrument to
conveigh support and comfort to you
in the time of <hi>soul-sinking afflictions,</hi>
you must study the promises, and pray
unto God that his Spirit may <hi>irradiate</hi>
them, and shew you the fulness of
them, and your interest in them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> How must wee improve the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:57918:76"/>
promises, so as to make them spiritual
bladders, to keep us from being
drowned in the deep waters of Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> You must doe three things.</p>
            <p>1 You must make a <hi>Catalogue of the
Promises.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Three things to bee done by those that would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the promises.</note>
            </p>
            <p>2 <hi>You must seriously</hi> ponder and
meditate on them.</p>
            <p>3 You must <hi>apply them</hi> to your own
souls, as belonging to you in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.</p>
            <p>1 You must make a <hi>Catalogue of the
Promises,</hi> you must gather them up,
as they lye scattered in the Word, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a <hi>spiritual Nose-gay,</hi> and binde them
together: You must doe as they that
gather up ends of Gold and Silver,
you must lose none. Every promise
is as a <hi>ray of gold,</hi> as a Star in the firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
And though there are starrs of
divers magnitudes, differing from one
another in glory, yet every star hath
its beauty and benefit: So though
some Promises are more glorious than
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:57918:76"/>
others, (like the Sun, in comparison of
the Moon) yet every promise hath its
beauty, and lustre, and as star-light in
a dark night is very comfortable; so in
the dark night of affliction, every <hi>little
promise</hi> will afford unspeakable comfort
to a troubled soul.</p>
            <p>To help you in making this Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue,
give mee leave to suggest three
things.</p>
            <p>1 Bee sure to make it in <hi>time of
health.</hi> Woe bee to those that have
their promises to gather, when they
should make use of them! <hi>You that
sleight the promises in prosperity, shall
receive no comfort from them in adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2 <hi>Forget not to treasure up all
those promises which God hath made
to his children, in the day of their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity.
As for example, God hath
promised</hi> in all our afflictions to bee with
us, <hi>Isa.</hi> 43. 2. When thou passest through
the waters, I will bee with thee, and
through the Rivers, they shall not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:57918:77"/>
thee, &amp;c. <hi>hee will bee with you to
protect and direct you, to support and
comfort you.</hi> If three Saints bee put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the fiery Furnace, the Son of God will
make the fourth, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. 25.</p>
            <p>2 God will be <hi>afflicted</hi> in all our <hi>affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,</hi>
Isa. 63. 9. he suffers in all our suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings,
<hi>Act.</hi> 9. 4.</p>
            <p>3 Hee will make our <hi>beds in our
sicknesses,</hi> Psal. 41. 3. hee will conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend
to the lowest office for our ease
and refreshment.</p>
            <p>4 Hee will <hi>know our souls in adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity,</hi>
Psal. 31. 7. hee will know us to
pitty us, and to succour, and to help
us.</p>
            <p>5 Hee will keep us from the <hi>evill</hi> of
all <hi>afflictions,</hi> Job 5. 19. God hath not
promised to keep his people from af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions,
but to keep them from the
hurt of them. Though they are not
good in themselves, yet hee will turne
them to our good, <hi>Heb. 12. 10. 1 Cor.
11. 32. Ier.</hi> 24. 5. The good Figs
were carried into Captivity for their
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:57918:77"/>
good. God hath promised that <hi>all
things shall worke together for our good,
Rom.</hi> 8. 28. not only all Ordinances, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
but all Afflictions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6 God hath promised <hi>to lay no more
upon us, than wee are able to bear,</hi> but ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to give us less <hi>pain,</hi> or <hi>greater pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,</hi>
1 Cor. 10. 13. <hi>And though in a
little wrath hee hide his face from us for a
moment, yet with everlasting kindness
will he have mercy on us, &amp;c.</hi> Isa. 54. 7, 8.
These, and many such like Promises,
will bee as so many <hi>spiritual Cordials</hi> to
revive our <hi>fainting spirits,</hi> and as so
many <hi>Pillars</hi> to uphold us under the
greatest Affliction.</p>

            <p>1 That the <hi>Promises</hi> are the

his Adversity. They are his
chiefe <hi>City of Refuge,</hi> when all

that is not founded upon a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,</hi>
is <hi>Delusion,</hi> not <hi>true Consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
And therefore a Discourse

the Text.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="117" facs="tcp:57918:79"/>
2 That there are diverse par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
added to these Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
concerning the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
Necessity, Excellency,</hi> and
<hi>Vsefulness</hi> of the <hi>Promises,</hi> which
were not mentioned in the
preaching of them. And if
any of them shall appeare to
bee <hi>Heterogenial</hi> to the Text,
yet if they prove serviceable
to <hi>heighten</hi> thy esteeme of the
Promises, and to <hi>quicken</hi>

the <hi>Promises,</hi> so as to

<pb n="122" facs="tcp:57918:82"/>

            <p>2 Fixedly, and seriously <hi>meditate</hi> on
them;<note place="margin">We must not only make a Catalogue of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, but meditate on them.</note> first, hee must <hi>treasure</hi> up these
<hi>Iewels</hi> in his heart, and then <hi>unlock</hi>
them by <hi>meditation;</hi> first, hee must
make his <hi>Nose-gay,</hi> and then smell of
it. The Word of God (as I have
said) is as a <hi>Garden</hi> full of <hi>excellent
Promises,</hi> as so many <hi>choice flowers.</hi>
And it is our duty to walk often in
this <hi>Garden,</hi> to gather up all the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
that lye scattered in it, into se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<hi>Nose-gayes,</hi> to binde them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
(if I may so speake) with the

smell of them. The <hi>Promises</hi> are the
<hi>Saints Legacies</hi> left them by Christ
in his last <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Testament.</hi> The
Saints are called the <hi>Heires of the
Promises,</hi> Heb. 6. 17. And if they
would bee filled full of joy in the
day of their distresse, they must bee
frequent in reading these <hi>Legacies:</hi>
The <hi>Promises</hi> are (as it were) the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:57918:82"/>
               <hi>breasts of God,</hi> full of the <hi>Milk of
grace and comfort.</hi> And it is our duty
to bee sucking out (by meditation)
the milke of grace and comfort con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in them. That which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
saith of the <hi>Church of Christ,</hi> may
as truly bee said of the <hi>Promises of
Christ. Rejoyce, O yee people of God,
and bee glad all yee that have an interest
in the Promises; Rejoyce for joy, all
yee that are mourners in Sion,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isa. 66. 10, 11.</note>

the Saints <hi>Cordials,</hi> the Saints <hi>Planke</hi>
to swim to Heaven upon, the Saints
<hi>Fiery Chariot,</hi> to carry them up to
Heaven. And the great reason why
they walke so <hi>uncomfortably,</hi> so <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consolately,</hi>
and so <hi>unbeleevingly,</hi> in the

they do not <hi>chew</hi> these <hi>Cordials,</hi> they do
not read over these <hi>spiritual Legacies,</hi>
they doe not by serious <hi>meditation</hi> and
<hi>consideration, sucke</hi> out the comfort

that is in a <hi>flower,</hi> unless shee abide
upon it; no more can any <hi>Childe of God</hi>
receive <hi>supportation,</hi> and <hi>consolation</hi>
from the Promises in the houre of
temptation, unless hee seriously and
solemnly ponder and meditate on
them.</p>
            <p>There is a double difference between
a <hi>presumptuous sinner,</hi> and a <hi>poor, humble,
distressed</hi> Childe of God.</p>
            <p>1 A <hi>presumptuous sinner</hi> studieth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but the <hi>promising Word:</hi>
               <note place="margin">The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and a true Childe of God in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises.</note> Hee
sleights the <hi>commanding,</hi> and the
<hi>threatning Word.</hi> The Word com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
him to keep holy the Sabbath
day, not to love the world, not to
lust, but hee turnes a <hi>deaf ear</hi> to it.
The Word threatneth to <hi>wound the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:57918:83"/>
hairy scalp of every one that goeth on in
his wickednesse,</hi> but because <hi>God</hi> is <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient</hi>
and <hi>long-suffering,</hi> therefore hee
regards it not. But as for the <hi>Promising
word,</hi> hee <hi>snatcheth</hi> at it, hee doth not
truly lay <hi>hold on it,</hi> but <hi>snatcheth</hi> at it,
before it belongs to him, and <hi>Spider-like,</hi>
sucks the <hi>poyson of sin</hi> out of it,
and makes of it a <hi>Cradle</hi> to <hi>rock</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
asleep in sinful courses. Because
God hath promised, <hi>That whensoever a
Sinner turnes from his sins which hee hath
committed, hee shall surely live, and not
dye,</hi> therefore hee delayes, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogues
his turning from sin.</p>
            <p>But now a <hi>poor, distressed, humble
Christian,</hi> fails on the contrary part; hee
<hi>pores</hi> upon the <hi>commanding and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Word,</hi> but never ponders the
<hi>promising Word.</hi> God (saith hee)
commands mee to <hi>love him with all
my heart and soule,</hi> to <hi>wash my heart from
iniquity,</hi> to <hi>love my enemies,</hi> to <hi>cut
off my right hand, and to plucke out my
right eye, &amp;c.</hi> But I cannot performe
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:57918:84"/>
these commands, therefore surely
shall never bee saved. God (saith hee)
hath threatned to <hi>curse every one that
continueth not in every thing that is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in his Law to do it,</hi> and therefore
surely I am accursed.<note place="margin">Three ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servable things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Promises.</note> But hee never
studies, nor ponders the promising
Word, for if hee did, hee would
quickly <hi>know three things</hi> for his ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
comfort.</p>
            <p>1 That <hi>there is nothing required by
God in his Word as our duty, but God
hath either promised to bestow it upon us
as his gift, or the Saints have prayed
to God for it as his gift.</hi> God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
us to love him, but hee hath
promised to <hi>circumcise our hearts to
love him, &amp;c.</hi> Deut. 30. 6. God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
us to <hi>fear him,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ezek. 18. 31.</note> to <hi>turn our selves</hi>
from our transgressions, and to <hi>make
our selves a new heart, and a new
spirit.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ezek. 36. 26.</note> But hee hath promised to <hi>give
us a new heart,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jer. 32. 40</note> 
               <hi>and a new spirit, to put
his fear in our hearts,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mic 7. 19.</note> 
               <hi>that wee shall
never depart from him,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 6. 14</note> and to <hi>turn us
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:57918:84"/>
from our evill wayes.</hi> The Saints of God
also have prayed unto God for this,
as the fruit of his free mercy, <hi>Ier. 31.
18. Lam<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> 5. 21. There is nothing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
in the <hi>Covenant of works,</hi> but
God hath promised in the <hi>Covenant of
grace,</hi> in some measure to work it in
us, for hee hath promised to <hi>work all
our works in us,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isa. 26. 12.</note> and to <hi>write his Law</hi>
(not one Commandement of it only,
but the whole Law) <hi>in our hearts,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jer. 31. 33.</note> and
to <hi>put it in our inward parts,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ezek. 36. 27.</note> and to <hi>cause
us to walk in his wayes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2 That God under the Covenant of
grace, will for Christs sake accept of less
than hee requires in the Covenant of
works. <hi>Hee requires</hi> perfection of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
<hi>but hee will accept of</hi> perfection
of parts, <hi>hee requires us to live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
sin, but hee will accept of our
sincere endeavours to doe it. If
there bee</hi> a willing minde, it is accepted
according to that a man hath, and not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to that hee hath not, 2 <hi>Cor. 8.
12.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="128" facs="tcp:57918:85"/>
3 <hi>That</hi> though hee cannot in his owne
person perform all that God commands, yet
Iesus Christ as his Surety, and in his
stead, hath fulfilled the Law for him, and
that God will accept of Christs perfect, as
a cover for his imperfect righteousnesse.
<hi>That</hi> Christ hath redeemed him from the
curse of the Law, being made a curse for
him. <hi>That the Threatnings of the Law
are</hi> Serpents <hi>without a</hi> sting, <hi>and that</hi>
Christ <hi>hath taken away the power and
force of them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Did a <hi>broken-hearted,</hi> and <hi>wounded
sinner</hi> ponder and meditate on these
things, they would fill him full of
joy and comfort. Hee would flye
from the <hi>Covenant of Works,</hi> to the
<hi>Covenant of Grace;</hi> from his owne <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousnesse,</hi>
unto the <hi>righteousnesse
of Christ;</hi> and from the <hi>commanding</hi>
and <hi>threatning word,</hi> unto the <hi>promising
word;</hi> hee would say, Lord! Thou
commandest mee to walke in thy Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes,
and to keep thy Lawes; This I
cannot do of my selfe, but thou hast
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:57918:85"/>
promised <hi>to cause me to walke in thy ways,</hi>
and to <hi>write thy Law in my heart.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Domine da quod jubes, &amp; jube quod vis Aust.</note> Lord
give me power to doe what thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandest,
and then command what thou
wilt.</p>
            <p>2 A <hi>presumptuous Sinner</hi> is alwayes
studying the promising Word,<note place="margin">The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</note> to
<hi>bolster</hi> up himself in sin, but hee ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
studies his <hi>sins and iniquities, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
for them, and from them.</hi> Hee me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditates
on the Promises to <hi>harden</hi> his
heart in sin, but not at all on his sins to
<hi>humble</hi> himself for them, and to turne
from them.</p>
            <p>But now on the contrary, <hi>A poore
distressed Christian</hi> pores upon his <hi>ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities
and corruptions,</hi> but never
mindes himself of the <hi>Promises,</hi> and
this makes him live so dejectedly, and
disconsolately. A wicked man studi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
his <hi>Corruptions too little.</hi> A di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed
Christian <hi>too much.</hi> If hee did
study the Promises, as much as he doth
his corruptions; hee would not walk so
uncomfortably.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="130" facs="tcp:57918:86"/>
Wherefore if ever you would make
the <hi>VVord of God a Conduit</hi> of <hi>comfort</hi>
in the day of your distresse; you must
not only meditate on the <hi>commanding</hi>
and <hi>th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eating word,</hi> but on the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising
VVord.</hi> The Commandements
and threatnings must drive you to the
Promises; you must not only study
your <hi>corruptions</hi> to <hi>humble you,</hi> but
also the <hi>Promises</hi> to <hi>comfort you.</hi> I doe
not say, you must <hi>not study your cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions,</hi>
but you must joyn the study
of the Promises together with them.
If <hi>Abraham</hi> had minded only the
<hi>deadnesse of</hi> Sarahs <hi>wombe,</hi> and of his
own body, hee had never beleeved, &amp;c.
but hee was strong in Faith, and stag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered
not because hee <hi>considered not
his owne body now dead, when hee was
about an hundred years old,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom 4. 19, 20, 21.</note> 
               <hi>nor the
deadnesse of</hi> Sarahs <hi>wombe, but was fully
perswaded, that what God had promised,
hee was able to performe.</hi> If <hi>Sarah</hi> had
considered only that shee was past
age, shee would never have beleeved
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:57918:86"/>
that shee should have a Childe, but
she eyed the Promise, and <hi>judged him
faithful,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 11. 11</note> 
               <hi>who had promised,</hi> and that
made her beleeve. If a Saint of God
<hi>looks</hi> only <hi>downwards</hi> upon the dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of his heart, and meditates on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon his sins and infirmities; hee
will never bee comforted in the day
of his distresse. But hee must also
<hi>look upwards</hi> unto the Promises, seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
ponder, and fixedly study them,
which will bee as <hi>strong Pillars</hi> to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
him, and keep him from fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
into despair; in the hour of tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> What are the <hi>Meditations</hi> which
we must have in reference and relation to
the Promises in the day of our distress?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> I will rank them into nine parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
            <p>1 You must <hi>meditate</hi> upon the three
great truths already mentioned,<note place="margin">The first meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on about the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises.</note>
            </p>
            <p>1 That God commands nothing as
our duty, which he hath not promised,
as his gift.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="132" facs="tcp:57918:87"/>
2 That God in the Covenant of
grace, will accept of less than hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
in the Covenant of works.</p>
            <p>3 That if wee truly beleeve in
Christ, God will accept of his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse,
as a satisfaction for our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousnesse.</p>
            <p>2 You must <hi>meditate</hi> upon the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency</hi>
and <hi>preciousnesse</hi> of the <hi>Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, meditate on the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciousnesse of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises.</note>
they are called <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>,
<hi>exceeding great and precious
Promises;</hi> They are precious in five
respects.</p>
            <p>1 Because they <hi>cost a great price,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 4 The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises are precious in five re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects. 2 Cor. 1. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

(even the bloud of Christ) <hi>to purchase
them.</hi> They are all made to us <hi>in
Christ,</hi> and <hi>for Christ;</hi> they are <hi>in him
yea,</hi> and <hi>in him Amen.</hi> The Covenant
(which is the Pandecta and Cabinet
of all the Promises) was sealed with
his Bloud.</p>
            <p>2 Because they <hi>assure us of great
and precious things;</hi> they assure us of
our <hi>interest in God,</hi> of our <hi>justification,
reconciliation, adoption, sanctification,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:57918:87"/>
and glorification. Heaven</hi> it self is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else but the <hi>injoyment of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,</hi>
Heb. 6. 12. The Promises are
<hi>Heaven folded up;</hi> Heaven is the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
unfolded.</hi> For the <hi>Promises</hi> are
nothing else but the <hi>eternal purposes of
God towards his Children made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest.</hi>
The <hi>purposes of God</hi> are his <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed
Promises;</hi> and the Promises are
his <hi>revealed purposes.</hi> The Promises
are the <hi>kisses of Iesus Christ,</hi> they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
his dear love, and when hee dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers
to us our <hi>interest</hi> in them,
then hee <hi>kisses us with the kisses of his
mouth,</hi> and fills us with <hi>joy unspeakable</hi>
and <hi>glorious.</hi> They are made <hi>by God,</hi>
and they make over <hi>God</hi> to us, as our
<hi>portion,</hi> and <hi>Christ</hi> as our <hi>Saviour,</hi> and
the <hi>Spirit</hi> as our <hi>Sanctifier,</hi> and <hi>all good
things,</hi> both here and hereafter as our
<hi>inheritance,</hi> and therefore may well
bee called <hi>exceeding great and precious
Promises.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3 Because they put a <hi>price</hi> upon
the <hi>New Testament;</hi> for wherein doth
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:57918:88"/>
the <hi>New Testament</hi> exceed the <hi>Old,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
it be in this, because it is <hi>founded
upon better Promises?</hi> Heb. 8. 6. and
<hi>bringeth in a better hope,</hi> Hebrews
7. 19.</p>
            <p>4 Because they put a <hi>price upon all
the blessings of God.</hi> A <hi>little mercy</hi>
reached out to us, as a <hi>fruit of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,</hi>
is more worth than a <hi>world of
blessings</hi> comming to us meerly by <hi>way
of providence.</hi> A man may receive
blessings from God upon a <hi>double ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,</hi>
either <hi>ex largitate,</hi> or <hi>ex promis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,</hi>
either by way of <hi>providence,</hi> or
by way of <hi>Promise. 1 By way of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
Thus God gives the earth to the
sons of men,</hi> Psal. 115. 16. Thus hee
gave one hundred twenty and seven
Provinces to <hi>Ahashuerus.</hi> Thus he sets
up the <hi>basest of men to rule over Nations,</hi>
Dan. 4. 17.</p>
            <p>2 By <hi>way of Promise.</hi> Thus hee
gives health, wealth, and all outward
comforts unto his children. For <hi>god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse
hath the Promise of this life, and
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:57918:88"/>
that which is to come,</hi> 1 Tim. 4. 8. Now
you must know that a little blessing
coming to us, as a fruit of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
is more worth than a thousand
blessings comming to us, only by way
of <hi>Providence.</hi> And therefore <hi>David</hi>
saith, <hi>A little that the righteous man
hath, is better than the riches of many
wicked,</hi> Psalm 37. 16. And the reason
is,</p>
            <p>1 Because blessings given by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of a <hi>Promise,</hi> are <hi>signes of Gods spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
love,</hi> and come flowing to us from
the <hi>same love</hi> with which God gives us
<hi>Christ,</hi> they are the fruit of <hi>Covenant-love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2 Because wee have them <hi>as</hi> bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings.
A man may have a <hi>blessing,</hi>
and yet not have it <hi>as</hi> a blessing. The
<hi>Israelites</hi> had Quails sent them imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
from God, which was a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
in it self, but was not sent to them
<hi>as</hi> a blessing.<note place="margin">Psal. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>8, 30, 31</note> For while <hi>the meat was
in their mouthes, the wrath of God came
upon them.</hi> The wicked have blessings,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:57918:89"/>
but not <hi>as</hi> blessings, but as the <hi>Cup</hi> in
<hi>Benjamins</hi> Sack, which proved a snare

godly have blessings <hi>as</hi> blessings: They
have <hi>grace</hi> with them to improve them
for <hi>Gods glory;</hi> they have not only the
<hi>blessings,</hi> but a <hi>thankful heart</hi> for
them, and a <hi>fruitful heart</hi> under them,
which is a certaine signe that they have
them <hi>as</hi> blessings.</p>
            <p>3 Because they are <hi>pledges</hi> to them
of <hi>better mercies,</hi> and <hi>beginnings</hi> of <hi>bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>
They are not <hi>merces,</hi> but <hi>arrha,</hi>
not their <hi>wages,</hi> but an <hi>earnest</hi> of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
Now a <hi>farthing</hi> given as an <hi>ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest</hi>
of a thousand a year, is more
worth than many pounds given as a
reward. A <hi>wicked man</hi> hath outward
blessings as his <hi>portion,</hi> his <hi>Heaven,</hi> his
All; but a <hi>godly man</hi> that hath them
by <hi>vertue of a Promise,</hi> hath them as a

in a <hi>Familistical sense</hi> (as if wee were

are by the Promises made partakers of
the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> that is, of the
<hi>Divine Graces,</hi> by which wee are made

a Promise to a distressed Christian, in

not more comfortable to a man in a

precious,</hi> but never <hi>more precious</hi>
than in times of misery and calamity;
and therefore let us in such times espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially

God promiseth in his Word, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

Hos. 14. 4. <hi>I will heal their back-sliding,
and love them freely.</hi> The reason why
God makes us his people, is not from
any worth in us, but only because it
pleaseth him so to do, 1 <hi>Sam. 12. 22.
The Lord will not forsake his people for
his great names sake, because it pleased the

Jesus Christ, who is the great and

are the Promises of that God, who
cannot deny himself. <hi>Promissae haec tua

               <note place="margin">Mat. 5. 18</note> There
is no Promise which God hath made,

will perform <hi>by his power.</hi> God is not a
<hi>man that hee should lye, neither the Son
of man, that hee should repent: Hath
hee said, and shall hee not doe it? or hath
hee spoken, and shall hee not make it good?</hi>
Numb. 23. 19. God hath promised
that the same Bodies that dye, shall
rise againe at the last day. This is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible
to Natural reason. The <hi>Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icks</hi>
and <hi>Epicures</hi> derided it, when it
was preached by <hi>Paul,</hi> Acts 17. 32.
But hath God said it, and shall he not
doe it? <hi>Is the Lords hand shortned?</hi>
               <pb n="141" facs="tcp:57918:91"/>
Therefore Christ tells the Sadduces,
<hi>Matth. 22. 27. You erre, not knowing
the Scriptures, and the power of God.</hi>
God is <hi>omnipotent,</hi> and therefore able

God hath promised at the <hi>Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
to make our <hi>vile bodies</hi> like unto

Who shall change our vile bodies, and
fashion them like unto his glorious Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
according to the working whereby

the power of God, <hi>Rom. 11. 23. God

who hath the Spirit, hath all good

Obligations, because hee had inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
all the <hi>Noble-men</hi> in <hi>France</hi> unto
himselfe, by preferring of them. A
<hi>true and real Christian</hi> is the richest
man in the World in Promises and
Obligations, for hee hath the Great
<hi>God</hi> ingaged by promise to bee <hi>his God,</hi>
and the <hi>God of his.</hi> As <hi>Charles</hi> the
first, commanded his <hi>Herald</hi> in a chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
to <hi>Francis</hi> the first, King of

King</hi> of <hi>Castile, Arragon, Naples,
Sicily, &amp;c.</hi> But <hi>Francis</hi> commanded
his <hi>Herald</hi> to call him so often <hi>King</hi> of
<hi>France,</hi> as the other had titles by
all his Countries; implying, that
<hi>France</hi> alone was more worth than all
his Countries. So when a wicked man

            <p>1 They are the <hi>breathings of Divine
love and affection.</hi> It is an Argument
of Gods wonderful love to his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:57918:96"/>
that hee is pleased to enter into
a Promise and Covenant to bee their
God, and to give them Christ, and in
Christ all blessings here, and hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
Wee read <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 2, 3. when
God told <hi>Abraham</hi> that hee would
make a <hi>Covenant with him,</hi> hee <hi>fell on
his face as astonished</hi> at so great a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and as <hi>thankfully acknowledging</hi> the
goodness of God towards him. The
like wee read of <hi>David.</hi> When God
by <hi>Nathan</hi> made a promise to him,<note place="margin">2 Sam 7. 11, 18, 19.</note> hee
goes into <hi>Gods house, and prayes, Who
am I, O Lord, and what is my house, that
the Lord my God should do this! &amp;c.</hi>
The Promises are the <hi>Cabinets of the
tender bowels of God,</hi> they contain the
dear and tender love of God towards
his elect children, God by promising
<hi>makes</hi> himself a <hi>debtor</hi> to them. Now
that God who is bound to none (no
not to the Angels of Heaven) should
enter into bonds, and binde himselfe
to give grace and glory to his elect
children, this is love above expression.
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:57918:97"/>
And there is nothing moved God to
do this (but as I have said) his free
grace and mercy. For though God
bee now bound out of <hi>justice</hi> and
<hi>faithfulness</hi> to fulfill his <hi>Promises,</hi> yet
nothing moved him to make these
promises, but his <hi>love</hi> and <hi>mercy,</hi> as
<hi>David</hi> saith of what God had promised
to him, 2 <hi>Sam. 7. 21. According to
thine own heart (ex mero motu volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis)
and according to thy Word,</hi> not for
any thing in mee, For <hi>what am I, O
Lord! &amp;c.</hi> Thus you see how the
Promises are the <hi>breathings of Divine
love and affection,</hi> and upon <hi>this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count</hi>
are very usefull and profitable.
For <hi>love is loves loadstone;</hi> therefore
the Apostle saith,<note place="margin">Magnes amo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

               <hi>Wee love him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
hee loved us first.</hi> The sense of
Gods love to us, will kindle a love in
us to God. Even as the <hi>beams</hi> of the
<hi>Sun</hi> reflecting upon a <hi>VVall,</hi> heats
those that walk by the Wall. So the
<hi>Beams</hi> of <hi>Gods love</hi> shining into our
souls, warms our hearts with the <hi>love
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:57918:97"/>
of God.</hi> The <hi>lov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of God constrains us,</hi>
as saith <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 14. There is a
<hi>compulsive</hi> and <hi>constraining power</hi> in
love. What did not <hi>Iacob</hi> do for the
love of <hi>Rachel?</hi> How was <hi>Mephibo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth</hi>
affected with the love of <hi>David?</hi>
2 Sam. 9. 8. It is our duty to <hi>love</hi> those
that <hi>hate us,</hi> but not to love those
that love us, is more than <hi>heathenish</hi>
and <hi>brutish<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>2 They are <hi>the life and soule of
Faith.</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises are the life and soul of Faith.</note> Faith without a <hi>Promise</hi> to <hi>act</hi>
upon, is as a <hi>body</hi> without a <hi>soul,</hi> as a
<hi>dead flower</hi> which hath no <hi>beauty</hi> or
<hi>sweetness</hi> in it; But Faith grounded
upon the Promises, will inable a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
to advance in all manner of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
What made <hi>Abraham forsake
his Country, and his Fathers house,</hi> and
<hi>go hee knew not whither?</hi> Nothing
moved him to this, but because God
had promised to make him a great
Nation, and hee beleeved it. Of all
graces, none so causal of holiness as
the grace of Faith: It is a <hi>world over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:57918:98"/>
heart-purifying, life-sanctifying,
wonder-working grace;</hi> and therefore
the Promises must needs bee very use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
because they are the life and soul
of Faith.</p>
            <p>3 They are the <hi>Anchor of Hope.</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ises are the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor of Hope.</note>
Hope is called an <hi>Anchor of the soule,

are the <hi>Anchor</hi> of Hope.<note place="margin">Heb. 6 9.</note> All
<hi>Hope</hi> of Heaven, which is not found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon a <hi>Promise,</hi> is <hi>presumption,</hi> and
not <hi>Hope. Presumption</hi> is when a man
hopes to go to Heaven, upon no
<hi>ground,</hi> or upon an <hi>insufficient ground.</hi>
But <hi>true Hope</hi> is a <hi>Hope grounded</hi> upon
a <hi>Scripture-Promise:</hi> And Hope bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed
upon <hi>Divine Promises,</hi> will
mightily availe unto purity and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
<hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi> li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
as <hi>pilgrims</hi> and <hi>strangers</hi> upon
earth, because they <hi>looked and hoped
for a City which hath foundations, whose
builder and maker is God.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 11. 9, 10.</note> The Old
Testament Saints would not <hi>accept de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance
upon sinfull termes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 11.</note> 
               <hi>because
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:57918:98"/>
they hoped for a better Resurrection.</hi> The
Papists and Arminians are much mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in teaching, That <hi>the assurance
of salvation is an enemy to godliness.</hi> The
Scripture saith the quite contrary,
1 <hi>Ioh. 3. 3. Hee that hath this Hope puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth
himselfe, even as hee is pure.</hi> The
true <hi>Hope of Heaven, will make us live
heavenly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4 They are the <hi>Wings of Prayer:</hi>
Prayer is a Divine <hi>Cordial</hi> to <hi>convey
grace</hi> from Heaven into our soules.<note place="margin">The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises are the wings of Prayer.</note> It
is a <hi>Key</hi> to unlock the bowels of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
which are in God. The best way
to obtain <hi>holiness,</hi> is upon our <hi>knees;</hi>
the best posture to <hi>fight</hi> against the
<hi>Devil,</hi> is upon our <hi>knees;</hi> and therefore
Prayer is not put as a part of our <hi>spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Armour,</hi> but added as that which
must bee an ingredient in every part,<note place="margin">Eph. 6. 18</note>
and which will make every part effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual.
But now the Promises are the
<hi>Wings of Prayer.</hi> Prayer without a
Promise, is as a <hi>Bird without VVings:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 32. 12.</note>
And therefore wee read both of <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi>
               <pb n="156" facs="tcp:57918:99"/>
and <hi>Iehoshaphat,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Chron. 20. 8, 9.</note> how they urged
God in their prayers with his Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.
And certainly the <hi>Prayers</hi> of the
<hi>Saints winged with divine promises,</hi> will
quickly <hi>flye</hi> up to <hi>Heaven,</hi> and draw
down grace and comfort into the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
souls. And upon this account it is
that the Promises are so useful to a
Christian, because they are so help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
in prayer. When wee pray, we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>

                  </gap>
our sins for us, are greater helps against
sin, than our promises to God to mortifie
sin.</hi> Many men in the day of their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress
vow and promise to leave sin, and
fight against it in the strength of these
promises, and in stead of <hi>conquering</hi>
               <pb n="157" facs="tcp:57918:99"/>
sin, are <hi>conquered</hi> by sin. But if wee
fight against sin in the strength of
Christ, and of his promises; if wee
urge God in prayer with his owne
Word, wee shall at last get victory
over it. For hee hath said, <hi>That sin
shall not have dominion over us,</hi> Rom. 6.

to <hi>Christ the Center.</hi> For the Promises
are not made for any thing in us, nor
have they any stability from us, but
they are made in, and for Christ unto
us, unto Christ in our behalf, and unto
us, so far as we are Members of Christ.
Now Jesus Christ is the ground of all
soul-purification, soul-consolation, and
soul-salvation; And therefore I may
safely conclude, that the promises are
most singularly usefull and advantagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.
And that it is the duty of all
those that desire to live holily and
comfortably, to consider and ponder
the profitableness and beneficialness of
the Promises.</p>

the <hi>great necessity that lyeth upon all
men to get a Scripture-interest in the

Christians</hi> to attend diligently to this
Discourse about the Promises, and to
shew them the <hi>necessity</hi> of minding and
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:57918:101"/>
of studying them. For hee that hath
no right to them is in a <hi>faithless, hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,

condition.</hi> All the <hi>happiness</hi> of a
<hi>Christian</hi> both here and hereafter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth
especially in his right and title
to the promises. The Scripture tells
us in express words, that hee that is
<hi>a stranger from the Promise,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eph. 2. 12</note> 
               <hi>is without
Christ, without God, without hope.</hi> Sad
is the condition of that man, who hath
no interest in <hi>God,</hi> nor in <hi>Christ,</hi> and
who is without hope. And such is the
condition of him who is a <hi>stranger to
the Promises;</hi> for all hope of Heaven,
which is not <hi>bottomed</hi> upon a <hi>promise,</hi>
is <hi>presumption,</hi> and <hi>soul-delusion.</hi> All
comfort and joy which is not <hi>grounded</hi>
upon a promise, is <hi>soul-cousenage;</hi> and
all <hi>Faith</hi> not <hi>anchored</hi> upon a <hi>Promise,</hi>
is nothing else but <hi>flattery<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and <hi>soul-mockery.</hi>
Consider this you that are
<hi>full of joy and comfort,</hi> and (as you say)
relye upon <hi>Christ</hi> for salvation; Tell
mee, what promise have you to build
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:57918:101"/>
this Faith, this hope, this comfort up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
For there are thousands that <hi>flatter</hi>
themselves <hi>into Hell</hi> by a <hi>false hope of
Heaven;</hi> thousands which promise to
<hi>themselves</hi> to goe to Heaven, but have
no <hi>promise</hi> for it <hi>from God.</hi> Such were
the <hi>five foolish Virgins;</hi> such was the
Church of <hi>Laodicaea,</hi> such were they,
<hi>Matth. 7. 24. Hos. 8. 2, 3. Micha</hi> 3.
10, 11. Remember this, and let it bee
daily in your thoughts: you that have
not true right to the Promises, your
<hi>Faith</hi> is <hi>faction,</hi> your <hi>Hope</hi> is <hi>presumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
and your <hi>joy</hi> is delusion. To bee a
<hi>stranger from the Promise,</hi> is to be <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
God, without Christ,</hi> and <hi>without
Hope.</hi> So much for the second particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
viz. <hi>Meditate on the Promises.</hi>

               <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ow I come to the third and
last particular. He that would
make the <hi>Promises</hi> as spiritual
bladders to keep him from drowning in
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:57918:103"/>
the deep waters of affliction, must not
only make a <hi>Catalogue</hi> of them, and
<hi>meditate</hi> upon them, but hee must
make <hi>Application</hi> of them to his own
soul, as belonging to him in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.
Hee must (as it is said of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Patriarchs, <hi>Hebrews 11. 13.) be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
of them,</hi>

hee must <hi>hugge</hi> and <hi>kisse</hi> them as his
<hi>rich portion,</hi> and <hi>glorious inheritance.</hi>
And this is the chief of all: For no
man can receive any comfort from
a Promise, who is not able to make
out his interest in that Promise: As
the <hi>life</hi> of a <hi>Sermon</hi> is in the <hi>Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi>
of it unto our selves, so the <hi>life</hi>
of a <hi>Promise</hi> is in the <hi>appropriation</hi> of
it. <hi>Quid est Deus, si non est meus?</hi>
What am I the better (saith <hi>Origen)</hi>
that Christ took upon him the <hi>flesh of
a Virgin,</hi> if he took not <hi>my flesh?</hi> What
was the <hi>great Prince</hi> the better for the
miraculous plenty in <hi>Samaria,</hi> when
the Prophet told him that hee should
<hi>see it with his eyes, but not eat of it?</hi>
               <pb n="165" facs="tcp:57918:103"/>
As the man, who when he was ready
to be drowned, saw a Rain-bow (which
was a signe that the World should
never bee again drowned) said, <hi>Quid
mihi proderit haec Iris, si ego peream;
What am I the better for this Rain bow,
if I perish?</hi> So may I say, what is a man
the better for the <hi>rich Mine</hi> of treasure
contained in the Promises, if hee hath
no share in it.</p>
            <p>There are three sorts of Professors
of Religion.</p>
            <p>1 Some <hi>lay claime</hi> to the <hi>Promises</hi>
when they have no right to them;
such are your <hi>presumptuous sinners,</hi>
who take it for granted, that the
Promises belong to them, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
themselves into Hell by a false
hope in the Promises, who make a
<hi>Feather-bed</hi> of the Promises, upon
which they sleep securely in sin: As
<hi>Thrasilaus</hi> (a <hi>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d Athenian)</hi> laid
claime to every <hi>Ship</hi> that came to
<hi>Athens,</hi> though hee had right to
none: So a presumptuous sinner laies
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:57918:104"/>
claime to every Promise, though hee
hath right to none; he inlargeth them
beyond their bounds, and maketh the
conditional Promises to bee absolute,
and such as belong only to those that
are in Christ, to belong to him, though
he be not in Christ. He sucks the <hi>poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
of sin, and security, out of the <hi>sweet
flower</hi> of the <hi>Promises.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2 Some have an <hi>interest</hi> in the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,</hi>
and <hi>know</hi> their <hi>interest.</hi> These
<hi>live in Heaven</hi> while they are upon
earth, these <hi>rejoyce in tribulation,</hi> and
are <hi>more than, Conquerours</hi> over the
greatest afflictions. These are secure
from <hi>perishing</hi> in the day of distresse.
That man, who taking the Bible in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s hand, can say upon right
grounds, All the <hi>Promises in this Book
are my portion,</hi> and I have a right and
title to them, this man is <hi>happy above
expression.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3 Some have an <hi>interest</hi> in the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,</hi>
but <hi>do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> not know their interest,</hi>
and therefore <hi>dare</hi> not (in the hour of
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:57918:104"/>
trouble) <hi>apply</hi> them for their <hi>supporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and consolation.</hi> Such are your
<hi>broken-hearted, wounded, distressed,</hi> and
<hi>deserted Christians.</hi> Such can receive
no comfort from the Promises in the
day of affliction. When they begin
to apply them for their support, the
<hi>Devil</hi> suggesteth to them, and their
owne doubting hearts tell them, that
they <hi>mis-apply them,</hi> and that they
belong not to them. When a godly
Minister (whose office is to <hi>speak a word
in season to those that are weary,</hi> Isa.
50. 4.) indeavours by the Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Promises to comfort them,
their <hi>souls refuse to bee comforted,</hi> they
<hi>exclude</hi> themselves from having a
right to <hi>Christ,</hi> and his <hi>Promises,</hi>
though <hi>Christ</hi> would not have them
<hi>excluded.</hi> They groundlesly fear
that their names are written in the
<hi>black Book of reprobation,</hi> and that all
the <hi>Curses of the Law</hi> are their portion;
hence it is that they live so uncomfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably,
and disconsolately in the time
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:57918:105"/>
of affliction. Now then for the help of
such persons, who have a true title to
the Promises, but know it not, who
<hi>walke in darknesse, and see no light,</hi>
who beleeve they are <hi>Hypocrites,</hi> when
they <hi>are not,</hi> and that they are not in
Christ, when they are (that I may be
Gods instrument to inable such to
make <hi>Application</hi> of the precious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
unto their own souls in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
in the hour of trouble, for their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting
supportation and consolation)
I shall lay down these ensuing Rules,
and Directions.</p>
            <div n="1" type="rule">
               <head>Rule 1.</head>
               <p>1 Whosoever in a <hi>Gospel-sense</hi> doth
obey the <hi>commanding word of God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The first Rule for the right Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Promises.</note> hath
a real <hi>interest</hi> in the <hi>Promising Word
of God:</hi> Though thou canst not <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly</hi>
obey the will of God, yet if thou
dost <hi>truly desire,</hi> and <hi>industriously in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour</hi>
to obey it in all things. If <hi>God</hi>
hath written his Law in thy heart, and
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:57918:105"/>
given thee a <hi>Gospel-frame,</hi> inclining
thee to the obedience of all his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements
<hi>sincerely,</hi> though not <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly;</hi>
this is an <hi>infallible evidence,</hi> that
thou hast a right and portion in all the
Promises. This is that which God
saith, <hi>Exod. 19. 5. If you will obey my
voyce indeed, then yee shall bee a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
treasure, &amp;c.</hi> If yee will obey my
voyce <hi>indeed,</hi> not only in word, and in
shew, but in <hi>deed,</hi> and in <hi>truth.</hi> Thus
<hi>Ierem. 7. 5, 7. If yee thorowly amend
your wayes, if yee thorowly execute
judgement, &amp;c. then will I cause you to
dwell in this place, &amp;c.</hi> If yee <hi>tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly</hi>
amend, &amp;c. not only in <hi>some
things,</hi> but in <hi>all things;</hi> not only <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly,</hi>
but <hi>inwardly</hi> also. This Rule
is expresly delivered by the Apostle,
1 <hi>Tim. 4. 8. Godlinesse hath the promise
of the life that now is, and that which is
to come.</hi> If thou beest a godly man in
a Gospel-sense, that is, one who truly
and sincerely indeavoureth to bee
godly. If thou makest Gods Will,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:57918:106"/>
thy <hi>Rule to live by,</hi> and not thine own.
<hi>Gods glory</hi> thy end, and not thy own
carnal interest. <hi>Gods love</hi> thy <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple.</hi>
If thy <hi>Rules, Aimes,</hi> and <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi>
bee <hi>godly,</hi> all the Promises of
this Life, and of the Life to come, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to thee. It is worth observing:
that all the Promises of Life and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
are <hi>conditional. Happiness</hi> is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailed
upon <hi>Holiness, Glory</hi> upon <hi>Grace.</hi>
You shall read in Scripture of the
<hi>blessings</hi> of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> and of the
<hi>bond</hi> of the <hi>Covenant,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ezek. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of the <hi>Promises,</hi> and of the <hi>condition</hi>
of the <hi>Promises.</hi> If ever you would
assure your selves of your interest in
the <hi>blessings of the Covenant,</hi> you must
try your selves by your sincere per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of the <hi>condition.</hi> Thus Christ
is promised to none but such as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve;
pardon of sin, to none but such
as repent; and Heaven, to none but
such as persevere in well doing. Tell
mee then, Canst thou say as in Gods
presence, that thou hast respect to all
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:57918:106"/>
Gods Commandements (though thou
failest in all, yet thou hast respect to
all) that thou obeyest God <hi>in deed,</hi>
and <hi>in truth,</hi> and that thou sincerely
labourest to bee godly? This is a
certaine signe, that all the <hi>Promises
are thy portion;</hi> but you that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly,
and doe not thorowly amend
your wayes, you that sleight, underva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue,
and despise the <hi>commanding Word,</hi>
you have no part, no portion in the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising
word.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it may bee a distressed Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
(though without just cause) will
say that hee is afraid that hee doth not
sincerely obey the commanding word,
and therefore dares not apply to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
the promising word, wherefore I

to them.</hi> This I speak only to the
distressed Christian; not that I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
his fear: But this I say, This
fear which thou art possessed withall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
is a <hi>probable signe</hi> that thou hast an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
in the Promises. For a <hi>presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
Sinner</hi> never doubts of his right
to them, but takes it as a Maxime
not to bee denied, that they belong
to him. It is a comfortable saying of
Mr. <hi>Greenhams,</hi> When thou <hi>hearest
the Promises, and art in a cold sweat,
and hast a fear and trembling seizing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thee; lest they should not belong to thee,
doubt not, but that they doe belong to thee;</hi>

                  <p>2 There are no Promises so <hi>abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute,</hi>
as to exclude all <hi>endeavours</hi> on

<hi>for us,</hi> but <hi>by us.</hi> Wee work,

                  </p>
                  <p>3. Absolute Promises are <hi>founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of industry,</hi> as well as conditional.
The truth of this I made out in the
former Sermon.</p>
                  <p>4 Absolute Promises are <hi>demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strative
arguments</hi> of <hi>special election,</hi>
and of the <hi>perseverance</hi> of the Saints.
There are some peculiar ones to whom
God hath promised (in the use of
means) absolutely to <hi>write his Law
in their hearts,</hi> to <hi>cause them to walk in
his wayes,</hi> to give them <hi>infallibly,</hi> and
<hi>infrustrably</hi> repentance, faith, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severance.
The promise of the <hi>first
grace,</hi> and of the <hi>crowning grace</hi> is <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute.</hi>
And therefore the Doctrine of
<hi>Special Election,</hi> and of <hi>Perseverance</hi>
must needs bee true.</p>
                  <p>5 Absolute Promises are <hi>mighty
helps to wounded consciences,</hi> and <hi>rare
Cordials for fainting and despairing
Christians.</hi> When thou art in the

                     <hi>Answ.</hi> Take heed of making <hi>des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate

as the King of <hi>Nineveh, Who knoweth
but God may turn, and have mercy?</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
not thy self; Neither man, nor
<hi>Angel</hi> can say <hi>thou art excluded.</hi> No
man ought to beleeve himself to bee
a Reprobate (as I have shewed) these
promises belong to all that can lay
hold on them as they are tendred.
As the <hi>brazen Serpent</hi> belonged to all
those who were able to look upon it;
so do <hi>these Promises</hi> to all that can by

all the <hi>fruit of the same free love in God;</hi>
They are all the <hi>branches of the same
Covenant of grace.</hi> (And therefore if
thou hast a right to the Covenant,
thou hast a right to all the Promises)
they all <hi>carry us to</hi> Christ, <hi>and meet in</hi>
Christ, and are in him <hi>Yea,</hi> and in him
<hi>Amen;</hi> And therefore if thou hast a
right to Christ, thou hast a right to
all.</p>
               <p>This is a point of <hi>singular comfort</hi>
in the <hi>worst of dayes and dangers.</hi> For
sometimes a <hi>childe of God</hi> under great
afflictions, can <hi>lay hold</hi> upon <hi>one promise,</hi>
and not upon <hi>another,</hi> and some can
apply those which <hi>others cannot,</hi> and
others those which <hi>they cannot.</hi> Let all
such know for their great comfort,
That hee that hath right to <hi>one branch
of the Covenant, hath right to all;</hi>
Hee that hath let fall a <hi>chain of gold,</hi>
consisting of divers links into the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
if hee can catch hold upon any
one of the links, hee will easily get
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:57918:123"/>
out the <hi>whole chain.</hi> The Promises
are like to a <hi>golden chain with divers

this will <hi>assure thee of thy interest in all
the rest.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have known many (yea, very
many) who have dyed with a great
deal of comfort from the application
of that one Text, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 14. unto
their own condition. <hi>Wee know that wee
have passed from death, unto life, because
wee love the Brethren.</hi> When all other
evidences failed them, and all other
Texts of Scripture afforded them no
comfort; <hi>here they anchored,</hi> here they
found rest for their soules. They
blessed God that they could say,
that they <hi>loved the Brethren,</hi> and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
them, <hi>not for any outward respects,</hi>
but because of the <hi>Image of God in
them,</hi> and they loved them when <hi>poor,</hi>
as well as when <hi>rich;</hi> and the more

them;</hi> and they loved them even
when they were reproved by them of

it in time of adversity. Make, and
read over thy Evidences for Heaven in

time of health, and learn then by heart,
that when thou comest into a dark con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
thou mayest neither</hi> have them

did, <hi>Gen.</hi> 38. 18. 25. When <hi>Iudah</hi>
her <hi>Father in law,</hi> lay with her, shee
took as a pledge, his <hi>signet, bracelets,</hi>

and said, <hi>By the man whose these are,
am I with childe,</hi> and thereby shee sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
her life. So must you do. In
time of <hi>health</hi> study thy <hi>interest</hi> in
the <hi>promises,</hi> and in time of <hi>sickness
live</hi> upon what thou hast <hi>studied,</hi> then
bring forth thy <hi>staffe</hi> and <hi>bracelets, &amp;c.</hi>
then <hi>produce thy evidences,</hi> and make
use of them as <hi>spiritual butteresses</hi> to
keep thee from falling into despair.<note place="margin">Mrs. Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with Mrs. Moor in Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manbury.</note>

Thus I have in three Sermons
taught you how to make use of
<hi>Scripture-promises,</hi> as <hi>Conduits</hi> of <hi>soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supportation,</hi>
and <hi>soul-consolation</hi> in the
day of distress. When you here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
read the <hi>Bible,</hi> remember the
<hi>promising-word</hi> (as well as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
and threatning word) make
a <hi>Catalogue</hi> of the Promises, medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
upon the <hi>pretiousness, freeness,
usefulness, latitude, richness,</hi> and <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutability</hi>
of them. They are as <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi>
as <hi>God</hi> himselfe, they have the
<hi>strength of God,</hi> the <hi>comforts of God,</hi>
and <hi>assistance of God</hi> in them. Above
all, labour to make <hi>application</hi> of them
to your own soul. For this purpose,
study these <hi>thirteen Rules</hi> and <hi>Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>
Pray unto God to give thee <hi>spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
eyes,</hi> to see thy interest in them,
and <hi>spiritual hands</hi> to reach out after
them. Pray to God to give thee spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
<hi>ability,</hi> to <hi>act faith</hi> upon the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,</hi>
to draw <hi>vertue</hi> from them, as

from Christ;</hi> to <hi>suck out</hi> all the <hi>sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
that is in them, to <hi>hang upon
them,</hi> as the <hi>woman</hi> did upon the
<hi>Prophet,</hi> and as a <hi>Bee</hi> doth upon a

to thy soul, to <hi>live in God,</hi> and <hi>on God
here,</hi> till thou comest to enjoy the
<hi>blessings promised with God</hi> for ever in
heaven.</p>
               <p>There is one Objection behinde,
which when I have answered, I have
done. For a distressed Christian will
object, and say,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> Though the promises are
<hi>rare cordials,</hi> and shall all of them
bee certainly fulfilled, yet <hi>God</hi> is
<hi>oftentimes</hi> long before hee fulfills
them, and while God is fulfilling of
his promises, I may in the mean time
<hi>perish</hi> in my <hi>affliction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> It cannot be denied, but that
<hi>God</hi> is oftentimes very long in <hi>fulfilling
his promises.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 3. 15.</note> He promised that the <hi>seed
of the woman should bruise the Serpents
head;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lu. 18. 7, 8</note> but it was <hi>Four thousand years</hi>
                  <pb n="215" facs="tcp:57918:128"/>

Altar cry,<note place="margin">Rev. 6. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>How long Lord, when wilt
thou avenge our blood? &amp;c.</hi> But this is
not yet fulfilled.</p>
               <p>Nay, I must adde, That God is
not onely a long time <hi>performing</hi> his
promises, but sometimes instead of
<hi>performing</hi> them, hee seems to the eye
of flesh and blood to <hi>walk contrary to
them.</hi> Sometimes the <hi>Providences of
God run cross to his Promises.</hi> God
promised to make <hi>David King;</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of this, hee is persecuted by
<hi>Saul,</hi> as a <hi>Partridge upon the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,</hi>
hee is driven to that extremity
that hee begins to doubt of Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
and to say, <hi>That one day hee
should dye by the hand of Saul.</hi> God
promised to <hi>Ioseph,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Sam. 27. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>That the Sun,

and that his <hi>sheaf</hi> should bee <hi>lifted up
above the sheaf of his brethren.</hi> But hee
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:57918:129"/>
findes the quite contrary, his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
seek to <hi>slay him, sell</hi> him into
<hi>Egypt,</hi> and there hee is put in prison as
one quite forsaken of God. But yet
notwithstanding all this, you must
know, That though the way of God,
in performing his promises, bee very
<hi>mysterious</hi> and <hi>secret,</hi> yet hee will at last
perform every <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and tittle of
them. Thus <hi>David</hi> was at last made

him, for they would make him tarry lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
than hee should, nor yet when his

God would have him.</hi> Gods time is
the <hi>best;</hi> and they are soon enough de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered,

and at <hi>Gods time.</hi> This then is thy
great duty (O Christian) to wait pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently,
and beleevingly, and not to
seek by unlawful waies to bee rid of
they miseries, as <hi>David</hi> did by going to
the <hi>Philistims;</hi> and as many in <hi>Queen
Maries</hi> daies did,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 27. 1.</note> by yeelding to the
Popish superstitions. To help you
to wait Gods leisure, holding Faith
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:57918:130"/>
and a good conscience; you have</p>
               <p>1 Many rare and precious Promises
made to those that wait upon him,
which I have formerly named.</p>
               <p>2 You have four attributes in God
to support you, his <hi>faithfulness, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightiness,
infinite goodness, and wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi>
Hee is <hi>faithful,</hi> and not one <hi>tit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi>
of his Word shall fall to the ground;
hee is <hi>Almighty,</hi> and able to do what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
hee hath promised; hee is <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
wise,</hi> to know the best time
and season, and infinitely good and
loving to his children,<note place="margin">Lam. 3. 35.</note> and doth not
willingly afflict them, but will make
haste to help them.</p>
               <p>2 It is our duty to live upon <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,</hi>
while <hi>Providences</hi> seem to run
cross to <hi>Promises.</hi> This is the meaning
of <hi>Hab. 2. 4. The just shall live by Faith.</hi>
They shall <hi>live by Faith,</hi> when they
have nothing else to <hi>live</hi> on. When
sense and reason tell them, <hi>they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done,</hi>
then shall they <hi>live by Faith</hi> in
the Promises, and not only live <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently,</hi>
                  <pb n="219" facs="tcp:57918:130"/>
but <hi>comfortably,</hi> and <hi>joyfully,</hi>
as the same Prophet, <hi>Hab.</hi> 3. 17, 18, 19.
saith, <hi>Although the Fig-tree shall not
blossome, neither shall fruit bee in the
Vine, and the field shall yeeld no meat,
&amp;c. yet I will rejoyce in the Lord, I will
joy in the God of my salvation.</hi> This life
did <hi>Paul</hi> live, when the ship in which he
was,<note place="margin">Act 27. 20, 23, 24.</note> was ready to bee drowned, when
there was neither <hi>Sun-light,</hi> nor <hi>Star-light,</hi>
yet hee was exceedingly chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
because <hi>God</hi> had promised to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
him, and those with him. By
living this life, <hi>God is much honoured,</hi>
and our souls much quieted and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshed.</p>
               <p>3 It is our duty to <hi>continue praying,
till providences and promises meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether:</hi>
For it is prayer, and prayer
only, which will at last reconcile <hi>Gods
Promises,</hi> and <hi>Gods dispensations,</hi> and
cause them to <hi>meet,</hi> and to <hi>kiss one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi>
For as the <hi>Promises</hi> are the <hi>ground</hi>
and <hi>rule</hi> of our <hi>prayers;</hi> so our <hi>prayers</hi>
are the <hi>divine waies</hi> and <hi>means</hi> for the
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:57918:131"/>
obtaining of the Promises. I say, as
the Promises are</p>
               <p>1 The ground of our prayers. For
wee cannot pray in Faith, unless wee
have some promise to bottome our
prayers upon; therefore <hi>David</hi> often
chargeth God in his prayers with his
promise.<note place="margin">Psal. 119. 28, 38, 41, 65, 76, 107, 141, 149.</note> Hee harps eight times upon
the same string in one Psalm, to teach
us, that the greatest <hi>Rethorick and Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
wee can use in our prayers, is to urge
God with his promise.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2 They are not onely the <hi>ground,</hi>
but the <hi>rule of our prayers;</hi> As wee
must pray for nothing but what God
hath promised, so wee must <hi>regulate</hi>
our prayers <hi>according</hi> to Gods Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.
Those thing which hee hath <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
promised,</hi> wee must pray for <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely,</hi>
and where God hath put con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
and exceptions, there our
prayers must be conditional.</p>
               <p>Now as the Promises are the <hi>ground</hi>
and <hi>rule</hi> of our prayers, so <hi>our prayers</hi>
are <hi>divine means</hi> and <hi>helps</hi> for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:57918:131"/>
of the promises: Though God
hath made many glorious and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
promises to his children, yet hee
will perform none of them, but to
those who by prayer seek them at
his hands. When <hi>Nathan</hi> told <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
what great things God had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
to him, hee went into <hi>Gods
house</hi> to pray for them, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. The
Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> mentioneth a glorious
promise, <hi>Isa.</hi> 43. 25. but hee adds,
<hi>Put mee in remembrance,</hi> vers. 20.
Thus <hi>Ezekiel 36. 37. I will yet for this
bee inquired of by the house of</hi> Israel,
and therefore when you read the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
of the Bible, remember whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
God makes a <hi>promise,</hi> you must
<hi>make a prayer;</hi> and that <hi>prayer</hi> will
hasten the fulfilling of the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses:
You must <hi>continue to pray,</hi> and
faint not;<note place="margin">Hab. 2. 2.</note> for the <hi>vision is but for an
appointed time, though it tarry, wait for
it, because it will surely come, it will not
tarry.</hi> This did <hi>Daniel</hi> when hee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
the time approached, &amp;c.
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:57918:132"/>
hee prayed, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 2, 3. Thus did
<hi>David,</hi> Psal. 56. 9, 10, 57. 1, 2. Thus
must you do. These are the three
great Duties which the Lord requires
of us at all times, but more especially
in these our dayes, wherein the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences
of God seem to run quite cross
unto his promises. The Lord give us
grace to practise them. So much for

Brief Repetition of what was
said of Mrs. Elizabeth Moore
at her Burial.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hough I have finished my
Text, yet I have another
Text remaining, of which I
must speak a few words; and that is,
The <hi>Party deceased,</hi> at whose Funeral
wee are here met.</p>
            <p>Shee was a <hi>Woman</hi> (I verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve)
truly <hi>fearing God,</hi> and yet
throughout her whole life loaded
with many and great troubles. <hi>God</hi>
picked her out to bee a <hi>pattern</hi> of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions,
as hee had not long before
that Reverend and godly Minister,
Mr. <hi>Ieremiah Whitakers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Pattern</hi> teacheth us three
Lessons.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="224" facs="tcp:57918:133"/>
1 That all things come alike to all
in this world, and that no man knoweth
love or hatred by any thing that is before
him. <hi>The</hi> best of Saints <hi>sometimes are
upon the</hi> Dunghil, <hi>when the</hi> vilest of
men <hi>are upon the</hi> Throne. <hi>The best of
men are afflicted, when the worst of
men are in prosperity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2 That there is not so much <hi>evil</hi>
in <hi>affliction,</hi> or so much <hi>good</hi> in <hi>prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
as the <hi>world imagineth.</hi> For if
there were, God would not bestow so
much prosperity upon the wicked,
and exercise his dear children with
so many afflictions.</p>
            <p>3 That there will come a <hi>rewarding
day,</hi> in which it <hi>shall</hi> certainly bee well
with the <hi>Righteous.</hi> When I see a
<hi>wicked</hi> man <hi>prosper,</hi> I say, Surely there
will come a <hi>punishing day,</hi> in which
the wicked shall be turned into Hell.
When I see a <hi>godly</hi> man in <hi>adversity,</hi> I
say, <hi>Verily there is a reward for the
Righteous,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 58.</note> 
               <hi>verily there is a God that
judgeth in the earth.</hi> Such examples
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:57918:133"/>
prove that there is another life be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
this. And that if the <hi>godly had
hope onely in this life, they were of all
people most miserable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will not trouble you with a rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of her <hi>Christian carriage</hi> in the
time of her health, because it is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
known to most here present.
I shall onely take notice of her great
care and diligence in making <hi>her calling
and election sure.</hi> Shee had not her
<hi>Ark</hi> to build when the <hi>flood</hi> came, nor
her <hi>Corn</hi> to get when the <hi>seven years
of Famine</hi> came: Shee had laid up a
<hi>stock</hi> of <hi>graces,</hi> and <hi>comforts</hi> against the
evill hour; Shee had not her <hi>Evidences
for Heaven</hi> to get, at the houre of
death. But shee had collected and
composed them in the time of her
life, and when shee came to dye, shee
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ad neither her <hi>graces,</hi> nor her <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts,</hi>
nor her <hi>Evidences for Heaven</hi>
to seek, shee had nothing to do but
to dye.</p>
            <p>Her sickness was very long, and
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:57918:134"/>
very painful, concerning which I shall
briefly acquaint you with these few
particulars.</p>
            <p>1 <hi>God</hi> moved the hearts of <hi>very
many godly people,</hi> to take compassion
of her sad and afflicted condition, and
to <hi>contribute liberally</hi> (shee being poor)
towards her relief; this <hi>merciful provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi>
wonderfully comforted her; She
saw <hi>Gods love</hi> in it, and was so much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
with it, that she was (for a little
while) really and exceedingly afraid
(notwithstanding her great torments
by reason of a cancer in her breast) lest
she should have her heaven in this life,
and lest this mercy should bee all her
portion. The Lord recompence that
labour of love and that Christian chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
a thousand fold into the bosomes of
those who manifested so much kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
to her.</p>
            <p>2 Her <hi>Patience</hi> was very great. As
<hi>God</hi> increased her <hi>pains,</hi> hee increased
her patience, even to the admiration of
such of us as were frequent spectators
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:57918:134"/>
of it. She was brought to such a sweet
frame of spirit, as to bee <hi>willing to live
under all her torments, as long as God
pleased, and to dye whensoever he pleased.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3 Shee was a woman of a very
<hi>fearful nature,</hi> and in the time of her
health had many <hi>doubts and scruples</hi>
(notwithstanding all her care foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned)
<hi>about her salvation.</hi> But in
her sickness, all her doubts vanished.
<hi>God</hi> chained up <hi>Satan.</hi> The <hi>Devil</hi> had
no power to tempt her, shee felt a
great <hi>calmness</hi> in her soul, and had
much inward peace, and injoyed more
of <hi>God,</hi> and his <hi>consolations,</hi> in the
time of her <hi>sickness<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> than in the time
of her <hi>health.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4 Shee was very forward in <hi>spread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
and <hi>diffusing</hi> those <hi>graces</hi> which
<hi>God</hi> had bestowed upon her, and in
giving <hi>good counsel</hi> to those who visit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
her. I have heard her often, and
often perswading her friends to <hi>prize
health,</hi> and to <hi>improve</hi> it for the good
of their souls, to <hi>lay up</hi> against an <hi>evill
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:57918:135"/>
day,</hi> and to <hi>stock</hi> themselves with <hi>grace</hi>
before sickness come. Shee would
frequently say, <hi>O the benefit of health!
O prize health! praise God for health,
and improve health for your eternal
good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5 Shee was very well <hi>vers't</hi> in the
<hi>Scriptures.</hi> The Law of God was <hi>her
delight;</hi> and this kept her from <hi>perish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
in <hi>her affliction.</hi> Shee was continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
fetching cordials out of the
Word, to comfort her under her
great pains, and to preserve her from
fainting. The twelfth <hi>Chapter</hi> of the
<hi>Hebrews</hi> was a precious cordial to her,
so was the eight of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and
the 2 of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> the 4. <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
and the 17, 18. <hi>verses. For our
light affliction which is but for a moment,
worketh for us a far more exceeding and
eternal weight of glory;</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While wee look not at the things
which are seen, but at the things which
are not seen; for the things which are
seen are temporal, but the things which
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:57918:135"/>
are not seen, are eternal.</p>
            <p>1 Cor. 15, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57.</p>
            <p>For this corruptible must put on in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruption,
and this mortal, must put on
immortality.</p>
            <p>So when this corruptible shall have put
on incorruption, and this mortal shal have
put on immortality; then shal be brought
to pass the saying that is written, Death is
swallowed up in victory.</p>
            <p>O death, where is thy sting? O grave,
where is thy victory?</p>
            <p>The sting of death is sinne, and the
strength of sin is the Law.</p>
            <p>But thanks bee to God which giveth
us the victory through our Lord Iesus
Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 21. Who shall change our vile
body, that it may bee fashioned like unto
his glorious body, according to the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
whereby hee is able even to subdue all
things unto himself.</p>
            <p>A little before her death shee said,
<hi>In the Lord Iehovah there is righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and strength;</hi> righteousness for
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:57918:136"/>
               <hi>justification</hi> and strength for <hi>supporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
Shee said, that the <hi>Word of God
was the best cordial in the world:</hi> And
that one <hi>minutes</hi> being in Heaven,
would make amends for all <hi>her pain
and misery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6 And lastly, I cannot but take
special notice of the happy <hi>close</hi> of
her life, and of the <hi>blessed end</hi> shee
made. It is said of <hi>Iob,</hi> James 5. 11.
<hi>Yee have heard of the patience of Iob,</hi>
and <hi>have seen the end of the Lord, &amp;c.</hi>
This our <hi>Christian Sister</hi> did in a great
measure, partake both of <hi>Iobs pains,</hi>
and <hi>Iobs patience,</hi> and made as happy
an end, as hee did, though in another
kinde. In the <hi>morning</hi> of that day in
which shee dyed, shee fell into a
<hi>slumber,</hi> in which shee heard (as shee
thought) one saying to her, <hi>This day
thou shalt bee with mee in Paradise.</hi>
Immediately shee awaked full of joy,
and though hardly able to speak, yet
shee uttered it to those who stood by,
and was much comforted with it.
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:57918:136"/>
Now though I am far from putting
any confidence in <hi>dreams,</hi> and doubt
not <hi>that a man may dream hee shall go
to Heaven, and yet bee cast into Hell.</hi>
Though I do not think that <hi>comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
dreams</hi> are <hi>sufficient evidences of
salvation.</hi> (Nay, when they are
brought as proofs of <hi>erronious opinions,</hi>
I account them <hi>Diabolical delusions;</hi>
and when wicked men have them,
<hi>pleasant presumptions.)</hi> Yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
when a <hi>woman</hi> who hath spent
many years in the <hi>service of God,</hi> and
is visited by <hi>God</hi> for above a year, with
great and most grievous pains, shall
at the close of her life, (when shee is
upon the very brink of eternity) have
such a <hi>sweet, refreshing, and heart-chearing
impression upon her spirit;</hi> when
<hi>heart fails,</hi> and <hi>flesh fails:</hi> When shee
can hardly speak to express the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of her joy, then to hear a voice
(as it were) saying to her, <hi>This day thou
shalt bee with mee in Paradise.</hi> This
(in all probability) was <hi>the voice of
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:57918:137"/>
God, and not of man.</hi> This was <hi>the
Lords doing, and it is marveilous in our
eyes.</hi> I forbear saying any more. Shee
is gone from a <hi>Prison</hi> to a <hi>Palace;</hi> from
a <hi>Purgatory</hi> to a <hi>Paradise.</hi> Shee is at
<hi>rest with God, where all tears are wiped
away from her eyes:</hi> The Lord fit us
by <hi>his grace</hi> to follow her in due time
into the <hi>Kingdome of glory.</hi> Amen.</p>

<pb n="237" facs="tcp:57918:139"/>
and this I shall make to appear in
five or six particulars.</p>
               <p>1 The Lord by his Spirit accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
the preaching of his Word, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the scales to fall from my eyes, and
opened them, and set up a clear light
in my understanding, and made mee
to see <hi>sin,</hi> to bee <hi>exceeding sinful,</hi> out
of measure sinful, and to look on it as
the loathsomest thing in the world, and
on my self as a loathsome creature in
Gods sight, and in my own sight, by
reason of the Leprosie of sin, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
I was over-run.</p>
               <p>2 The Lord brought mee to see the
<hi>misery</hi> that I was in, by reason of my
sins. I thought I was utterly forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of God, and I thought that God
would never accept of such a wretch
as I saw my self to bee. I could not
think otherwise, but that hell was my
portion, and that I, by reason of my
sins must go thither, expecting every
day when the Lord would glorifie
himself in my damnation. I saw my
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:57918:140"/>
self in more misery, because of my sins
than I could then, or now expresse to
any body. I looked upon God as a
<hi>consuming fire,</hi> and on my self as <hi>stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi>
ready to bee <hi>consumed</hi> by him,
&amp;c.</p>
               <p>3 The Lord brought mee to a <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
astonishment,</hi> that I cried out,
<hi>What shall I do to bee saved!</hi> and said
with <hi>Paul, Lord! what wouldest thou
have mee to do?</hi> Do but make known
to thy poor creature what thy will is,
and I thought I could do any thing,
or suffer any thing for the Lord. But
since I have had some more knowledge
of the holy Will of God, woe is mee!
what a barren and unfruitful heart
have I! a heart that can neither do,
nor suffer any thing for the Lord, as I
ought to do: But this I can say, that
the <hi>astonishment</hi> I was in by the <hi>sight</hi>
of my <hi>sins,</hi> and the <hi>misery</hi> I was plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
into, put mee on the <hi>performance
of holy duties,</hi> especially <hi>prayer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4 The Lord took mee off my own
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:57918:140"/>
                  <hi>bottome,</hi> off my own <hi>righteousness,</hi> and
made mee to see that that was but a
<hi>sandy foundation,</hi> and would not hold
out. I was not taken off from the <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance</hi>
of holy duties; no, I thought
with my self that I am commanded by
God to perform holy duties, which
is the way and means whereby wee
may meet with God (For hee is ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
to bee injoyed no where but in
his own ordinances) but the Lord took
mee off from <hi>resting</hi> and <hi>trusting</hi> in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances.
And as hee made mee to see
that without the practise of them hee
would not accept of mee; so also hee
made mee to know that it was not for
holy duties, for which I was accepted.
The sins that cleave to my best per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances,
are enough for which the
Lord may justly condemn mee, if I
had no other sins.</p>
               <p>5 The Lord brought mee to see a
<hi>Superlative beauty</hi> and <hi>excellency</hi> in the
<hi>Lord Iesus Christ,</hi> and my soul was
deeply in love with him, even with
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:57918:141"/>
                  <hi>whole</hi> Christ in all his <hi>Offices,</hi> and (if I
know any thing at all of my owne
heart) I desired Christ as much to bee
my <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Prophet,</hi> to teach, and
guide mee, and subdue mee to himself,
and rule over mee, as to bee my <hi>High-Priest,</hi>
to make Attonement by offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up of himself for mee, and washing
mee in his blood, by which I must bee
justified.</p>
               <p>6 The Lord brought mee to see a
<hi>soul-satisfaction</hi> in the Lord Jesus
Christ <hi>alone;</hi> and I think I should bee
as fully satisfied with Christ alone, as
my heart can desire. If I know my
heart, it panteth after Christ, and
Christ alone: <hi>None but Christ, none
but Christ.</hi> The whole world in <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison</hi>
or <hi>competition</hi> with Christ, is
nothing to mee: But in him I see full
contentment. To see and know my
interest in him and to injoy communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with him, is that, which if the Lord
would bestow upon mee, I should with
<hi>Iacob</hi> say, <hi>It is enough;</hi> and with old
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:57918:141"/>
                  <hi>Simeon) Now let thy servant depart in
peace, for my eyes have seen thy salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now I desire to set down some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Scripture Evidences, that I finde
upon search and examination of my
heart, by laying it to the Rule; The
Word of God.</p>
               <p>My Second Scripture Evidence is
taken from <hi>Mark.</hi> 2. 17.<note place="margin">Second Evidence.</note> Where Christ
saith, <hi>They that are whole have no need
of the Physitian, but they that are sick,</hi>
and <hi>hee came not to call the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
but sinners to repentance.</hi> Now
through Gods mercy I can say, that I
am a <hi>sin-sick-sinner</hi> (the Lord make
mee more sick) I am not <hi>righteous</hi> in
mine <hi>own</hi> eyes, but a sinner, and see
my self undone for ever, without the
righteousness of Christ bee imputed
to mee, and therefore I hope I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the number of those whom
Christ was commissionated by his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to come to save.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="242" facs="tcp:57918:142"/>
From <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 28, 29. I am <hi>weary</hi>
and <hi>heavy laden;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Third Evidence.</note> now Christ hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
to <hi>give ease</hi> to such. And I am
willing to <hi>take his yoke upon mee,</hi> and
would fain learn of him the lesson of
<hi>meekness</hi> and <hi>lowliness,</hi> and therefore
am invited to <hi>come unto him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I can say with <hi>David,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Fourth Evidence.</note> that my sins
are a <hi>heavy burden</hi> to mee, they are too
<hi>heavy for mee,</hi> Psal. 38. 4. and I can say
that I mourn, because I cannot mourn
no more for my sins; now Christ saith,
<hi>Blessed are they that mourn, for they shall
bee comforted,</hi> Mat. 5. 4.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 3. I think (if my
heart do not deceive mee) I am <hi>pòor in

Heaven,</hi> saith Christ.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. 20. I am a <hi>bruised
reed,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Sixth Evidence.</note> 
                  <hi>and smoaking flax,</hi> and therefore
Christ hath promised, hee will not
<hi>break</hi> such a reed, nor <hi>quench</hi> the
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:57918:142"/>
smoak of grace, if it bee true grace,
but hee will increase it more and more
(as hee saith) <hi>Untill judgement breake
forth into victory:</hi> And hee came to
set at <hi>liberty</hi> them that are <hi>bruised,
Luke</hi> 4. 18. Therefore I hope I am
such a one as hee came to <hi>binde up,</hi>
and set at <hi>liberty;</hi> Yea, and that
hee was <hi>anointed</hi> and <hi>sent</hi> by his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to mee, and such as I am, <hi>Isa.</hi>
61. 1.</p>
               <p>From 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 15.<note place="margin">Seventh Evidence.</note> 
                  <hi>This is a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
saying, and worthy of all acceptation,</hi>
(saith <hi>Paul) That Iesus Christ came
into the world to save sinners:</hi> And so
say I too; it is worthy all acceptation,
that Christ should come from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
of his Father, who was infinitely
glorious and happy, that hee should
come into the world to save <hi>mee, mee
a sinner,</hi> mee the <hi>chiefe of sinners;</hi> mee,
that if saved, I do verily beleeve,
there is none in heaven, nor any that
ever shall come thither, that hath or
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:57918:143"/>
will have the cause to <hi>magnifie and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore
free grace,</hi> as I shall have. And
herein doth God commend his love
towards mee—<hi>For if when wee were
enemies, wee were reconciled to God by
the death of his Son, much more being
reconciled, wee shall bee saved by his
life,</hi> Rom. 5. 10.</p>
               <p>I can say with <hi>Paul,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eighth Evidence.</note> that <hi>I delight in
the Law of God, after the inward man,</hi>
and I am grieved that I cannot keep
it. I finde that spiritual war in mee,
between <hi>flesh</hi> and <hi>spirit,</hi> which <hi>Paul</hi>
complaineth of, and I can say, that
<hi>Paul</hi> doth confess over my heart in
his confessions, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. And I can go
along with him there, from <hi>verse</hi> 9.
to the end of the chapter; and from
hence I gather, that there is some spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
<hi>life</hi> in my <hi>soul,</hi> and an <hi>indeavour</hi>
to walk after the spirit, and therefore
I hope and desire to conclude with
him, that there shall bee <hi>no condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to mee,</hi> but that the <hi>Law of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:57918:143"/>
of life in Christ Iesus shall make mee
free from the law of sin,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 1, 2</note> and death.</hi> I
finde an earnest desire wrought in my
soul, to bee made like unto Jesus
Christ, and that it may bee my <hi>meat</hi>
and <hi>drink</hi> to <hi>do</hi> and <hi>suffer</hi> his will, as
hee would have mee.</p>
               <p>I can say,<note place="margin">Ninth Evidence.</note> that the Lord hath in
some measure put his fear into my
heart, that I fear to offend him out of
love to him, and I love to fear him.</p>
               <p>I can say with the Church to Christ,<note place="margin">Tenth E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</note>
                  <hi>Cant. 1. 7. O thou whom my soul lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth!</hi>
(and if I know any thing at all of
mine own heart) Christ is <hi>altogether
lovely,</hi> and most desirable to my soul.</p>
               <p>I think I can truly say with <hi>David,</hi>
that <hi>I have none in Heaven but thee,
and there is nothing on earth that I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
besides thee,</hi> in <hi>comparison</hi> of thee,
in <hi>competition</hi> with thee. Though all
that is dearest to mee in the world
should forsake mee, yet if God whom
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:57918:144"/>
I have <hi>chosen</hi> for my <hi>portion</hi> will not
forsake mee, I have enough. It is
my desire and endeavour more and
more to <hi>account all things</hi> but <hi>loss</hi> and
<hi>dung,</hi> that I may win Christ. I can
with <hi>Peter</hi> make my appeal to him,
and say, Lord, thou who <hi>knowest all
things, thou knowest that I love thee,</hi>
and that it is the desire of my soul to
love thee more, and to love thee for
thy self, because thou art holy, and
good, and gracious, and the chiefest
amongst ten thousand; Yea God in
Christ alone, is worthy to be beloved,
and it is my <hi>highest priviledge</hi> that hee
will give mee leave to love him, who
only can satisfie my soul, and <hi>rede<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>m</hi> it
from death eternal, who hath justified
mee by his blood, and sanctified mee
by his Spirit, whom therefore I love
<hi>with all my heart, and all my soul, and
all my might, and all my strength.</hi> Finding
therefore, that God hath drawn out
my heart to love him, and make choice
of him alone, I from hence gather
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:57918:144"/>
and ground my hope, that God loveth
mee, according to that Scripture,
1 <hi>Ioh. 4. 19. Wee love him, because hee
first loved us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I finde my heart much inflamed
with love to all the children of God,<note place="margin">Eleventh Evidence.</note>
                  <hi>because they are Gods children,</hi> and the
more I see, or finde, or hear of God in
them, the more I finde my heart
cleaving to them, and I thinke I can
truly say with <hi>David,</hi> That my <hi>delight
is in the Saints, and those that excel in
grace;</hi> not because they are friends to
mee, or I have relation to them
in regard of outward obligations,
but because they bear the Image of
God upon them, and manifest it in
their holy conversation. I love them,
whether rich, or poor. And though
I did never know some of them,
but onely hear of their holiness, and
piety, yet I could not but exceedingly
love such. Therefore I hope <hi>that
I am passed from death to life, because
I love the Brethren, 1 Ioh.</hi> 3. 14.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="248" facs="tcp:57918:145"/>
                  <hi>I do not only love</hi> God,<note place="margin">Twelfth Evidence.</note> 
                  <hi>and the
children of God, but I labour to</hi>
keep his Commandements,<note place="margin">1 Joh 5. 3</note> 
                  <hi>and they are
not</hi> grievous <hi>to mee. But I pray with</hi>
David,<note place="margin">Psal. 119. 5. v. 32, 34</note> O that my waies were directed to

Commandements: Give mee understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and I shall keep thy Law, yea, I shall
observe it with my whole heart; <hi>for
therein do I delight.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I finde I am one that is very <hi>thirsty</hi>
after Jesus Christ,<note place="margin">Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</note> and the grace of
Christ; and I thirst to have his image
more and more stamped upon mee;
and I would fain bee assured by Gods

after a true and <hi>lively Faith,</hi>
because that Grace is <hi>a soul-transplant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and uniting grace.</hi> Now Christ hath
promised to <hi>satisfie</hi> the <hi>thirsty,</hi> Matth.
5. 6. and such Christ hath earnestly
invited to come, though they have
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:57918:145"/>
nothing to bring but what may make
against themselves, yet to come <hi>emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
and hee hath promised to <hi>fill them,</hi>
Isa. 55. 1, 2.</p>
               <p>I am willing to <hi>confess,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</note> and with all

my self a guilty <hi>malefactor,</hi> and judge
my self worthy of the just condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of the righteous Judge of all

are not as our thoughts, nor his waies,
as our waies,</hi> Isa. 55. 7, 8. It is my

comfort and hope, that hee who hath
<hi>begun</hi> a good work in mee, will <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi>
it. For it is hee that <hi>worketh all

               <p>I hope I am one whom God hath

hee hath bestowed upon mee
the <hi>fruits</hi> of the Covenant, because

and hath wrought an universal change

spirit which hee hath put within mee,
even the <hi>Spirit of Truth, which will
guide mee into all Truth.</hi> It is his own
promise to <hi>give his holy Spirit to them
that aske it of him</hi> (as I have done often)
<hi>Luke</hi> 11. 13. and I hope that God
will make it in his due time, a <hi>witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing</hi>

<pb n="251" facs="tcp:57918:146"/>
of all his promises, both <hi>of</hi>

<pb n="253" facs="tcp:57918:147"/>
upon Jesus Christ and his Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
for life and salvation by him
alone, and to see my self compleat
in him; this is supernatural. Yet I
must and will give glory to God, and
say, <hi>Lord I beleeve, help thou my unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leef.</hi>
And by this I prove that this
precious grace of faith is wrought
in mee, because Jesus Christ is to
mee very precious: and I finde in the
Word,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 7</note> 
                  <hi>that to them that beleeve hee
is precious:</hi> and I am willing to take
Christ upon his own termes, as hee
is tendred in the Gospel; and am
willing to give up my self soul and
body wholly to him; and my love to
<hi>God,</hi> and to the <hi>children of God,</hi> is a
<hi>fruit</hi> of my <hi>Faith,</hi> as also my desire to
bee made like unto him: For <hi>hee
that hath this hope in him, purifieth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
even as hee is pure,</hi> 1 John 3. 3.
And I trust that I am <hi>kept by the power
of God through faith unto salvation,</hi>
1 Pet. 1. 5. <hi>I know whom I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved,
and I am perswaded that hee is
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:57918:148"/>
able and willing to keep that which I
have committed unto him,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Tim. 1. 12.</note> which is my
immortal soul.</p>
               <p>Thus I have according to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
exhortation endeavoured to
give a <hi>reason of the hope that is in mee.</hi>
What have I but what I have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved?
The desire of my soul is, that
God may have all the glory. And if
I bee deceived, the Lord for Christs
sake undeceive mee, and grant that if
I have not true grace, I may not think
I have, and so bee in a <hi>Fools Paradise.</hi>
And the Lord that is my <hi>heart-maker,</hi>
bee my <hi>heart-searcher,</hi> and my <hi>heart-discoverer,</hi>
and my <hi>heart-reformer.</hi>
Amen.</p>
