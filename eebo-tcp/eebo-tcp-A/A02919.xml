            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>It is the parts therefore of vs which are partakers of
this trueth, first to be thankeful vnto almightie God
for preseruing the same from perishing; for gathering
to himselfe a Church wherein his truth is sounded, and
showen from age to age; and for admitting vs into that
companie, which both in this worlde doe professe his
Name, and in the worlde to come shal euerlastinglie
extoll his goodnes.</p>
            <p>And secondly it is our dueties by all the giftes and
meanes which God hath imparted vpon vs to aduance,
and promote this trueth. Which they among others do
worthilie that by preaching; but they, as I thinke, best
of al performe, which by writing publish, &amp; spread-a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
the same, and that not onely because for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time

present they do greatly profit, but especialie for that
they prouide both for the instruction, and comfirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

to the Prophets, much to the Apostles, to the Fathers
much, and much to the Godlie learned of our age. For
by their bookes and writings wee knowe the trueth,
which otherwise smallie, or not so perfectlie coulde be

out of the pure fountanes of Gods holie word, and
to the ouerthrowe of al aduersaries of the same, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
theie be Iewes, Turks, Papists, Atheistes, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
heretikes, written in the Latine tongue by that
learned, and paineful Pastor in the Church of Christ at
this day, Nicholas Hemmingius, publique professor of
diuinitie at Haffine à famous Vniuersitie in Denmark.</p>
            <p>Which treatise I haue translated into English for
these causes. One is, that the ignorant sort of people
may see, howe Protestants are not so, as the Papists giue
out, at variance among themselues. For this work, with
infinite other good bookes of foraine writers in our
English tongue, doth shew, that touching the substance
of Religion we varie not, neither wil by Gods grace,
though Satan gladly would bring it so to passe.</p>

               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nother is, that it may bee knowen from time to
time that the Religion which al the Protestants in the
world doe maintaine, is not à seruice of God newlie
found-out by Luther, Melancton, Caluine, and others,
as the Papists vntruely report; but is verie ancient, and
grounded altogether vpon Gods holy worde. For this
trueth here described, is builded not vpon the weake in
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>entions of man, but vpon the holie scriptures, as may
easilie appeare.</p>
            <p>The third, that it may be more knowen, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon
then hitherto it hath bine. For this is proper to true
<pb facs="tcp:19032:5"/>
Religion, which thing is not proper either to Poperie,
or to any sect of heretikes, that the more it is knowen,
the more it is desired; &amp; the more common, the more
commended.</p>
            <p>The last is, seing how good Christians do both stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouslie
reade, and also gratefulie accept good Books
in our vulgar tongue at this day, to giue them an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion,
when either for the ignorance, negligence, or
Non residence of their Pastors, or for other causes they
can not heare y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word preached, to inflame their zeales
by the reading of this Booke, which in al respectes is
so necessarie and singular, as in mine opinion, though
there be manie good, yet but fewe better Bookes. And
that it maie be read with more pleasure, and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoode
with more ease. I haue not onlie illustrated
the same with the places of Scripture, but also diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the Booke into Chapters, the one sheweth the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegritie
of the doctrine, and the other openeth the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie
of the method.</p>
            <p>And these my labors I am bolde nowe to publishe
vnder your name, Noble Comitisse, moued thereunto
partlie by the good reporte generalie giuen of your
Honor, as one which maketh no smal account both of
Christian religion, and of them, who are Christianlie

onelie the infinite sectes in à man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner

I knowe not what Ethiopians, that he hath

mightilie hath it beene confirmed, partlie through
euil education, &amp; partlie by the examples of those,
who doe seeme to excell others both in wisedome
and vertue.</p>
            <p>This loathsome darknes none other way ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled,
tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the torch of god his world. Hitherto
<pb facs="tcp:19032:6"/>
keth that question and answere of Dauid;<note place="margin">Psal. 119. 9</note> 
               <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
shal à yong man redresse his waie?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pro. 22. 6.</note> 
               <hi>In ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
heede to thy worde.</hi> Now seeing that as
youthis, such is age, as Salomon saith, it folow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
that without the worde of God which is the
only remedie for wickednesse, the whole life of man,
is altogether vncleane. And that vncleane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
which cleaueth in al men, vntil it be through
God his worde washed-awaie, is not so much à bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily,
as à spiritual &amp; inwarde blot, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sisting of many
partes. Whereof the firste (which is the spring of
others) is theignorance both of the trueth and of
goodnes; &amp; is compared vnto grosse darkenes, and
vnto blindnes, wherebie the whole soule of man, as
it were an ouglie monster, gropeth in the darke.</p>
            <p>The second is, to haue an erronius opinion of
heauenly matters; &amp; to imbrace and loue the same
as the most euident trueth. As manie Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,
and heretikes had, who by stiffe maintei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
opinions touching heauenlie mysteries, ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed-headlong
into damnation. Tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which nothing
could be more lamentable.</p>
            <p>The thirde is, in thought to yeelde vnto wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
affections. For as the minde is wickedlie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed:
So the affection of the minde, raised-vp
by sinister iudgement, is carried-awaie into that
which is worst.</p>
            <p>The fourth is, to consent vnto sinne: after which
ensueth an horrible swarme of al manner wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
(as Paul in his first chapter vnto the Romans
disputeth) vntil man be vtterlie drowned in euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
<pb facs="tcp:19032:6"/>
miserie.</p>
            <p>From these lamentable spots the soule of man is
purged by the cleere fountanes of our Sauiour,<note place="margin">Effectes of Gods word.</note> that
is by the worde of God. Touching the efficacie of
which worde of God,<note place="margin">Psal. 19. 7. 8.</note> Dauid speaketh to this effect:
<hi>The Lawe of the Lord is vndefiled, refreshing
the soules; The testimonie of the Lorde is
sure, and giueth wisedome vnto the simple;
The statutes of the Lord be right, and reioice
the heart; The commandement of the Lord
is pure, and giueth light vnto the eies.</hi> This
commendation of Gods word, although it be but
briefe, if you respect the wordes; yet is it verie
large, if you consider the lessons, and consolations
comprised in the same. Which commendation may
of right be opposed againste al the furious iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes
of Epicures, Politians, Hypocrites, and
Sycophantes. The partes of which commendation
are eight, al maruelouslie discerning betwene the
word of God, &amp; philosophical or humane doctrines.</p>
            <p>The firste; saith he, <hi>The Lawe of the Lord is
vndefiled,</hi> that is, the word of God both in it selfe
is pure, as that which proceedeth from God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
the most pure fountane; and also maketh those
to bee pure, who giue credite therevnto. But
mans doctrine, seeme it neuer so neate, and so
cleere, yet is it not in al respectes cleane, neither
can it make men cleane. The Philosophie of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,
so bewtified by Plato, maie seeme of right
before al other Philosophical doctrines, to be the
best. (For it containeth verie manie good &amp; right
<pb facs="tcp:19032:7"/>
sentences concerning God his prouidence, and end
of man:) yet is it foulie defiled, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Plato by lawes
alloweth an vncleane communitie: and by deed co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth
more horrible wickednes, than is of vs to be
vttered. And therfore both Socrates &amp; Plato whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
they endeuor of one side to purge the soule of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, on
the other theie defile the same with an abhomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
wickednes. But the word of God, or the sound of
the Gospel, as it is in al respectes pure: so it maketh
the soule of him, who by a liuelie faith embraceth
the Gospel, pure and perfect; it deliuereth him from
erronious opinions; it replenisheth him with sound
iudgement; and by the Spirite of Christ raiseth-vp
pure affections to which when the wil doth assent
the actions both internal &amp; outward, as most cleere
riuers from à most pure fountaine, do issue-out.</p>
            <p>The second, <hi>It refresheth the soules,</hi> saith
Dauid. The soules of men are withered with à most
grieuous thirst, neither can theie be comforted or
refreshed before theie haue drunke of the healthful
springes of Israel, which is the worde of the Gospel.
For the conscience of sinne doth euermore augme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
the thirst, which nothing but the liquor of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
doth mitigate or take-awaie. Of this water
the Prophet Zechariah speaketh, when he saith:
<hi>And in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> daie shal there waters of life go-out
from Ierusale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Zech. 14, 8.</note> that is <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
               </hi> word of the gospel which
is, that to the soule of man, which the most fresh
and cleere water is to him that thirsteth. Of this
speaketh our Lord in <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
               </hi> fourth of Iohn: <hi>whosoeuer
drinketh of the water that I shal giue him,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioh. 4, 14.</note> 
               <hi>shal
neuer be more a thirst: but the water that I
<pb facs="tcp:19032:7"/>
shal giue him, shalbe in him à wel of water,
springing-vp into euerlasting life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third, <hi>The testimonie of the Lord is sure,</hi>
that is, the word of god is no deceiteful testimony co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the wil of god to man-ward. For, as the voice
of the lawe doth witnes that God without respect
both of persons, &amp; of natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, wil throw together with
the deuils his enimies, al obstinate &amp; impenite<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
into euerlasting darknes, &amp; tormentes: So the
voice of the gospel doth testifie how God, for his Sons
sake, wil receiue al men, be theie neuer so egregious
sinners, into his fauor againe, that the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e may be nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
among the heires of eternal blessednes, if so be
that they beleeue the gospel, and with à liuely faith
rest vpon the Son of God, who hath giuen himselfe à
ra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>some for the sins of the world. In respect of this vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changable
rule of God his wil co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended to vs in his
word, the word of God is caled, <hi>Sure,</hi> &amp; the word of
the gospel,<note place="margin">Ioh. 8, 32.</note> 
               <hi>Truth;</hi> as when it is said, <hi>The truth shal
make you free.</hi> For the gospel, which is the word of
truth, doth offer Christ the deliuerer, of whome it is
written,<note place="margin">36.</note> 
               <hi>If y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> son shal mak you free, ye shalbe free
indeed</hi> The 4. <hi>it giueth wisedome vnto the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi>
The wise me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of this world know nothing of God
his wil as they should; they vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d not through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
his works, which are, to recite the chiefe, his wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
in creating of man; his iustice in the fal of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>;
his mercie in repairing of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, his merciful goodnes
in conuerting of à sinner; theie are ignorant of the
difference betweene the houshoulde of God and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
sectes; theie are ignorant of the waie both to
auoide eternal miserie, and to obteine euerlasting
<pb facs="tcp:19032:8"/>
happines; and they be ignorant of the manner howe
to serue God, which for the most part doth consist
in the feare of God, whose wisedome is infinite.
But euen simple ones through the sound of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
attaine this wisedome: whereas the greatest,
and most mightie of the world doe miserablie ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
themselues by their selfe wisedome. For the
word of the Lorde spoken by the Prophet Iremiah
shal stand for euer:<note place="margin">Iere. 8. 9.</note> 
               <hi>They haue reiected the word
of the Lord, and what wisedome is in them?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fifte, <hi>The statuts of the Lord be right.</hi>
This saying is to be opposed against the destinies
fained out of Zeno his schole. For it giueth to vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>derstande
howe God is no accepter of persons, bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
indifferent to al according to the rule of his decree.
Hee will doubtlesse the saluation of al men, but
through the knowledge of the truth. As it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 2. 4.</note>
(God) <hi>he wil haue al men shalbe saued, and
come vnto the knowledge of the truth.</hi> He wil
also that al impenitent persons, without respect of
any, shal vtterlie perish.</p>
            <p>The sixt, <hi>They reioice the heart.</hi> This effect
of the Gospel is the chiefest good thing which can
betide mankinde in this life. No doctrine of man
can tel how to heale the wounds of conscience. For
he which is guiltie in his minde of any grieuous
crime carrieth about with him day &amp; night à wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and an accusing conscience, which can bee
helped by no Philosophie at al. But the sound one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
of the gospel it is that applieth the good plaster,
and the most present remedie to the wounded con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
<pb facs="tcp:19032:8"/>
while it testifieth howe <hi>Christ died for
our sinnes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 4, 25.</note> 
               <hi>and is risen-againe for our iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi>

both godlie and rightly doth saie, <hi>hath made our
offences his offences, that his righteousnesse
might be our righteousnes.</hi> So that when our
consciences be sprinkeled with the blood of Christ,
as theie are when wee beleeue in him, then are
theie purified,<note place="margin">Psal, 84. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

doth insue. that with Dauid we maie saie, <hi>Mine
heart and my fleshe doe reioice in the liuing
God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The seuenth, <hi>The commaundement of the
Lord is pure.</hi> This is to be opposed to the Papists,
who by certaine diuelish subtilties, doe entangle
the worde of God, therebie to terrifie men from
the reading of the same. They say the letter, that
is, as they falselie expound it, the literal or gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
sense, whereas for al that, it is most true,
doth kil; and the spirite that is the allegorical in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation
approued of the Pope, doth quicken.
But the holie Ghost here by Dauid doth affirme
the contrarie, while it pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceth the word of God
to be cleere, bright, and pure: which indeede is
verie true as touching those things belonging vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the foundation of Christianitie, &amp; be altogether
necessarie vnto saluation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:19032:9"/>
The eight, <hi>It giueth light vnto the eies.</hi> This
decareth how ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s nature without the word of God
inlightning is altogether blind, as that which carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth-about
with it darkenes, to wit doubting of God,
carnal securitie, distrust, false praier of the mind
doubting, and flieng from the Lord with infinite o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s swaruing from the law of God. But the
world perceiueth not this blindnes, but rather hath
it in admiration, and price for the smale shadowe of
outward discipline whereas the Church admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
by the voice of God his word, doth acknowledg
and bewaile her offences, and beggeth of God newe
light, righteousnesse, and life. In this praier and
meditation of the Gospel, the eies of the minde be
more and more inlightened, so that the Sonne of
righteousnesse it selfe, euen Christe doth glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouslie
arise in their heartes; by whose brightnesse
we are ledde from endelesse miserie vnto eternal
life and blesseenesse. Dauid casting an eye vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
this most comfortable fruite of God his worde,
not without good cause cried-out in this verie
Psalme on this wise:<note place="margin">Psa. 19, 10.</note>

happines promised by the worde, shal endure for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer.
To be briefe, out of this worde Dauid lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
the manner both howe to escape euerlasting
miserie, and also to obteine the eternal felicitie &amp;
blessednesse, wherevnto man at the first was cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated,
<pb facs="tcp:19032:10"/>
and afterwarde redeemed by Christ.</p>
            <p>Seeing nowe the puritie, the necessitie, the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie,
the glorie, and the fruite of God his word
is so great, and so sweete, that it can ioine vs to
God, the soueraigne good thing, in whom, we shal
euerlastinglie be blessed, at what time as we haue
atteined the ende of our condition; doubtlesse theie
highlie are to be commended which bestow à por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their goods and riches to the maintenance
and propagation of Gods word in the Church. For
theie doe wel consider that this ende to al and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie
man according to his condition and state, is
proposed, namelie to aduance the glorie of God.
Which thing theie before others, doe best accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish,
who studie to vpholde the ministerie of the
worde in schooles, and temples. Now what dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
you, noble Sir, haue bestowed on this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe,
manie doe knowe and theie confesse, whome
at this daie you liberallie bring-vp both in this V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuersitie,
and also in other forreigne schooles, to
the ende that in these Churches of Denmarke
there maie be fit ministers fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> time to time, which
maie sounde-foorth the pure doctrine of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel.
And assuredlie this is trulie to loue our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie,
not onelie while we liue to adorne the same:
but after we are dead also to leaue it the better to
our posteritie. Wise me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do greatly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike
oath, in which, these words among other were,
<hi>I wil fight both for religious, &amp; for prophane
causes, and that alone and with others; and
wil leaue my countrie not the worser; but the
<pb facs="tcp:19032:10"/>
better and more ample to the posteritie.</hi> How
much more are we bounde so to doe, that are cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Citizens of the Church of Christe, the
most noble countrie of the righteous, whose honour
is more glorious, than was that of Athens, which
the Turkes now possesse. And therefore à farre
greater glorie it is to leaue this most worthie cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie,
I meane the Church of God, not the worser,
but the better, and amplified to posterities: which
theie doe, who by their wealth doe mainteine, and
promote the studies of true doctrin, &amp; of good arts.
Such an indeuor was in Dauid, when in à song he
saide howe he loued his countrie because of the
Church that was therin. <hi>Because of the howse of
the Lord,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psa. 122, 9.</note> saith he, <hi>I wil procure thy welth.</hi> This
howse which is the Church of God, he preferred
before the most glorious Palaties of earthlie Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,<note place="margin">Psal. 84, 10</note>
when he saide, <hi>A daie in thie courtes is
better then à thousand other-where. I had
rather be à doore-keeper in the House of my
God, than to dwel in the Tabernacles of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse.</hi>
Which Psalme, whereout these words
are taken, because it conteineth à notable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of God his Church, stirreth-vp vnto the
loue of the worde; laieth before our eies the beni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites;
depainteth the glorie of the Church; and
sheweth the scope proponed therevnto, which is
eternal blessednesse, I thought good the last yeare
publiquelie in our schoole to expounde the same,
therebie to inuite the youth vnto the loue, reading,
and meditating of the heauenlie worde, which is
<pb facs="tcp:19032:11"/>
as à burning torch to guide vs in this darkenes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the wonderful light of God, and vnto eternal
life.</p>
            <p>Now the cause that imboldened me to dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
this mine Enarration, written the yeare im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatelie
past vpon the 84. Psalme, vnto your
Honor, was not onelie the greate and singuler good
wil you beare toward learning &amp; littered men ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neralie,
which I desire that the whole world should
knowe; but also your benefites conferred vpon me
and mine particularlie, for which I thought good
to giue some token of à grateful minde to your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor.
The which I earnestlie beseech you, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
in in good part. If the quantitie of our worke
be onelie respected, I knowe wel it is far vnmeete
for your Magnificence: but if the minde of the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,
and the argument of the matter be waied, I
thinke no man wil finde faulte with me for this my
dedication. Wherefore, regarde these thinges, my
good Lord, and as hitherto I haue had, so hereafter
let me not want your fauor; and for my selfe I wil
endeuor to be worthie of the same.</p>
            <p>Thus fare you wel both in mind and bodie, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

From our studie this 25. of March, in the yeare
1569. Which from the creation of the worlde is the
5539. yeare, wherebie it is manifest that we are
fallen into the last parte of the age of the worlde,

so was it punished not with one,<note place="margin">2. Sam. 13, 14.</note> but with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diuers
plagues: As namely, 1, with the losse
of the holie spirite;<note place="margin">2. Sam. 13, 28. 29.</note> 2, with à most grieuous

With these plagues was Dauids reuolting fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

of the Church of Christ vnder the

the old tabernacle, as the Epistle vnto the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brues

as one to whome there was no en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance

out of doubt more deepelie thinke vpon the

is the vse of this matter being knowne? Out of
certaine places of the Scripture we wil gather
who is the Lord of hostes, whereof the Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist
here maketh mention. In the second of
Samuel it is said,<note place="margin">2. Sam. 5, 10<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Dauid prospered and grewe, for
the Lord of hostes was with him.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 59, 5.</note> And Psalme 59.
<hi>Euen thou, O Lord God of hostes.</hi> These two te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies
doe shewe, if we marke the Hebrue
text,<note place="margin">The whole Trinitie the Lord of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes.</note> howe that God which is one in essence,
and three in persons, is the Lord of hostes. For
in the former place, the proper name of God
taken from his essence, namelie <hi>Iehouah,</hi> is
put; in the latter the plural number <hi>Elohim,</hi>
whereby à pluralitie of persons, as the Father,
the Sonne, and the holie Ghost, is signified. But
that we should not thinke there be anie moe
persons than three, the Prophet Esaiah tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
vs, when he saith,<note place="margin">Isa. 6, 2. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>And the Seraphims cried

Lord of hostes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that this title is proper to the whole Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie.
Notwithstanding, bicause the second
person in the Godhead, namelie y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> euerlasting

strength of Satan, &amp; for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> redemption of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde,<note place="margin">Our Sauiour Christ is the Lord of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes.</note>
this great title is giuen to him in manie
places; as in the 24. Psalme, <hi>Who is this King of
glorie? The Lord of hostes is the King of glorie.</hi>
Here doubtles Christ,<note place="margin">Psal. 24. 10.</note> a figure of whome was
the arke of the couenant, is signified to be that
glorious King. And in the Prophet Esaiah, the
Lord of hostes is saide <hi>to dwell in Zion,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Isa. 8, 8.</note> which
certainlie must be vnderstood of Christ.</p>
               <p>Nowe,<note place="margin">Why our sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Christ is called the Lord of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes.</note> the Scripture ascribeth this glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
name to Christ, because he is the chiefe
captaine in the citie of God against the citie
of Satan, that is, in the Church against the
world, and the diuel. For he alone is, as the
most mightie, so the chiefest hed, and captaine
of al armies both celestial and earthlie. And
therefore in the forementioned psalme he is
called,<note place="margin">Psal. 24, 8.</note> 
                  <hi>The Lord mightie in battell.</hi> For he is not

not, but ouercommeth; he fleeth not, but tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umpheth;
and that not for his owne cause, but
for the whole citie of God. And therefore in
the 72. psalme, the chiefest honour is ascribed
to him,<note place="margin">Psal. 72, 19.</note> 
                  <hi>Blessed be his glorious Name for euer; and

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:19032:19"/>

if yet we maie cal him à meere man without

This Christ was he, whome notwithstanding that
Pilate had iudged him to the crosse, being accused
by the chiefe of our nation, yet ceassed they not to
loue him, who from the beginning had so done. For
the third daie he appeared quicke vnto them, in so
much that by the inspiration of God they fore-told
this, and other things of him, and euen til this daie
the stocke of Christians, so called of him, decaieth
not. But verie manie Iewes as at that time, so now,

and as others, that he goeth à begging about the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:19032:22"/>
world, and shal manifest himselfe, at the pleasure of
God. For seeing so many prophecies of the Prophets
do agree together vpon that time, the learneder
sort of the Iewes of that age were throughlie per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded
that in their time the Messiah should come.
Whereof it came to passe, that many by occasion of
the tyme professed them-selues to be the Messiah,
when afore that time no man went about the
same.<note place="margin">Iudas the Galilean. Ioseph Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zara.</note> Among which was one Iudas the Galilean,

the end declared his vanitie.<note place="margin">Barcozibas.</note> So was one Barcozi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas

many stood a long while, til at last he also was puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
by Adrian for his wickednesse. I ouerslip those
whom Foelix the gouernour of Iudea punished. For
it was a common thing at that time, the which the
Prophets assigned to the birth of Christ, to seduce
the people, especialy, seeing they beleeued the
Messiah should come for none other intent, than
by force of armes to bring other nations vnder his
subiection. By which meanes they should abound in
al kind of pleasures, and store of al things, the Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites
then liuing being brought againe into their
natiue and promised countrie.</p>
               <p>Seeing now the Iewes haue so grosse an
opinion concerning the end of the comming
of the Messiah, they do nothing differ from the

verie swine, and Lions: whereof those delight
to wallowe in the mire of filthie lust: and these
mightily to suppresse other beastes, that theie
alone may seeme to beare the swaie. Whose
pestilent errour is condemned through-out
the whole Scripture. For the whole scripture
doeth testifie how the Messiah shall appeare,
not to wage battell with men, like some Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules,
or great Alexander: but, according to
the first promise, to set-vpon the olde serpent;
to abolish sinne &amp; death; to repaire the image
of God in man, which through sinne was put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out;
and to rewarde his owne, that is, the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
with euerlasting righteousnes, &amp; immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talitie,

recordeth) both the time, the place, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:19032:23"/>
and the stocke of the Messiah borne, are
declared; and all these doe answere vnto the
fore-saiengs of the Prophets.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The time was signified by Iaakob the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The time of Christ his birth fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told by Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch: and by Daniel the prophet.</note>
The scepter shal not depart from Iudah, nor
à law-giuer from betweene his feete, vntil Siloh
come, and the people shal be gathered vnto him.
<hi>Furthermore, Daniel in his 9. Chapter saith:</hi>
Seuentie weekes are determined vpon thy people,
&amp; vpon thine holie citie, to finish the wickednes,<note place="margin">Gen. 49, 10.</note> and
to seale vp the sinnes,<note place="margin">Dan. 9, 24.</note> and to reconcile the iniquitie,
and to bring in euerlasting righteousnes, &amp; to seale
vp the vision and prophecie, and to annoint the
most holie.<note place="margin">25.</note> Knowe therefore and vnderstand, that
from the going-foorth of the commandement to
bring againe the people, and to build Ierusalem vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Messiah the prince, shal be seuen weekes, and
three score and two weekes, and the streete shal be
built againe, and the wall euen à troublous time.
And after three-score and two weekes,<note place="margin">26.</note> shal Messi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah
be slaine; and his people that wil denie him,
shal not be at al.<note place="margin">27.</note> And he shal confirme the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
with manie for one weeke; and in the middes
of the weeke, he shal cause the sacrifice and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blation
to ceasse.</p>
               <p>This prophecie of Daniel is verie notable,
which most euidentlie putteth the verie time
of the comming of Messiah before our eies.
One weeke doth comprehend seuen yeeres.
Therefore 69. make 489. yeeres. For so manie
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:19032:24"/>
yeares there came betweene the going-out of
the worde touching the building-againe of
Ierusalem vntil the Baptisme of Christ. Then
in the middle of the weeke Christ both prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched,
and was crucified. Then, about 40. yeres
afterward, followed the vtter abrogation of
Moses gouernement according to the wordes
of the Prophet. The computation whereof

there is no doubt but this question was

where-of sprang that admiration and wonde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.
Againe by this deede of his yet in his

               <p>Then from the 12. yeare vntil the 30. yeere

               <p>
                  <hi>Nowe when he was entered into the 30.

                  <hi>and cried,</hi> Repent:

vs from the cursse of the serpent, which he

euen as the sacrifice that was brought with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:19032:30"/>
the sonnes of Israël,<note place="margin">Num. 19, 2.</note> as may appeare Num. 19.
For the red kowe in the sight of all was killed,<note place="margin">Heb. 13, 11.</note>
and of the blood thereof, and of the ashes, and
water, purgations were made.</p>
               <p>Vnto the speedinesse of the Lords punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
(who was taken about night and led

carried vnto the iudgement hal of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident,

figure of the paschal lambe,<note place="margin">Iohn. 1, 29.</note> wherof Christ al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
is oftentimes called à lambe.</p>
               <p>But that it maie the better appeare howe
the bodie aunswereth to the shadowe,<note place="margin">Relation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Christ and the Paschal lambe.</note> and
the trueth to the figure, let vs compare one
thing with an other. For that paschal lambe
doth much resemble our Sauiour Christ, yet
as the shadowe the bodie, and the type the
truth.</p>
               <p>1 As therefore that Iewish lambe was à
male of à yeere old,<note place="margin">Comparison betwene the Paschal lambe and Christ.</note> and that without spot: so
Christ, à full and perfect man, was without
sinne.</p>
               <p>2 As the houses which were sprinckled with
the blood of the paschal lambe preserued the
inhabitor from destruction:<note place="margin">Exo. 12, 5.</note> so they,<note place="margin">Exo. 12, 13.</note> whose
consciences are sprinckled with the bloode
of Christe the immaculate lambe,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 1, 19.</note> shal bee
free from the punishment of sinne, which is
damnation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:19032:31"/>
3 As nothing of the paschal lambe might be
eaten that was either rawe,<note place="margin">Exod. 12, 9.</note> or boiled, or
sodden in water, but that which was rosted
with fire: So there was no part of the Lords
bodie but was rosted with great flames of
sorowe.</p>
               <p>4 As the children of Israel consumed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal
lambe with speede and that with vnlea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uened
bread and sowre herbes:<note place="margin">Num. 9, 11.</note> so with most
sharpe and sower mindes the Iewes put Christ
to death, and that with al possible speede.</p>
               <p>5 As the paschal lambe was offred of the
whole multitude of the sonnes of Israel:<note place="margin">Exod. 12. 6. 47.</note> So
that which through the counsel and wil of the
chiefe Priests, and rulers was done to Christ at
Ierusalem, maie seeme doubtles to be done of
al Israel verie fewe excepted.</p>
               <p>6 As by the commandement of God there
was à caution that no bone of the paschal
lambe should be broken:<note place="margin">Exo. 12, 46.</note> So albeit the hands
and feete of our Sauiour were fastened to the
crosse with nailes,<note place="margin">Ioh. 19, 37. 36.</note> &amp; his side peirced through
with à speare, yet not à bone of him was
broken.</p>
               <p>7 As none that was either vncleane,<note place="margin">Num. 9, 7.</note> or vncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised
did eate of that lambe,<note place="margin">Exo. 12, 44</note> but the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised
onlie: so he alone that is purged in
minde, and receiued into the familie of God
eateth vnto his saluation the flesh of the pure
lambe which is Christ.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:19032:31"/>
8 As that lambe through the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God was offered the tenth day of the
first moneth:<note place="margin">Exod 12, 2. 3.</note> so Christ the true lambe of God,<note place="margin">Ioh. 1, 29.</note>
the same day of that moneth,<note place="margin">Mat. 26, 18 19.</note> his father so ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing
it, was sacrificed vnto the Lord.</p>
               <p>9 As once in à yeare that paschal lambe was
killed:<note place="margin">Exod. 12, 3.</note> So once,<note place="margin">Heb. 9, 7.</note> and not often ought the sonne
of God to be offered, which thing also was
prefigured by that entrance of the chiefe
prieste into the holie place, and that once in
à yeere.</p>
               <p>10 Last of al,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 1, 18. 19.</note> as the sacrifice of the paschal
lambe pleased the Lord, and after it the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
came out of Aegyt: So through the sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of Christ mankinde is reconciled to God,
and brought out of bondage into libertie. The

of this sanctification, and attonement
were the sacrifices of the fathers, as of Abel,

fore-seen by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prophet Ioël,<note place="margin">Ioel. 2, 28.</note> who in his 2. cha.
saith on this wise: <hi>And afterward</hi> (that is after
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:19032:33"/>
Israël hath receiued the teacher of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
that they may both remember and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
those thinges, which he shal teach)
<hi>I wil powre-out my spirit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> vpon al flesh, and your
sonnes and your daughters shal prophecie, your old
men shal dreame dreames, and your yong men shal
see visions.</hi> The 50. day after the resurrection
of the Lord the euent most euidentlie aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
vnto this prophecie. For the spirit of
the Lord was powred vpon al flesh, not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularlie,
but generallie vppon Iewes, and
Gentils; yong and old, men &amp; women; bonde
and free;<note place="margin">Isai. 54, 13.</note> rude and learned &amp;c. And Isaiah 54.
<hi>And al thy children shal be taught of the Lorde,
and much peace shal be to thy children.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">What the opinions of philosophers were you shal finde afterwarde in this first part, chap. 42.</note> In times
passed man made himselfe an author, condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor,
and teacher of godlinesse, as appeareth
in the Philosophers, whereof diuers set diuers
endes of the felicitie which man should seeke
after: but nowe, although man teach man
the seruice of God; yet professeth he not his
owne, but the wisdome of God.</p>
               <p>The Apostles nowe hauing receiued the
holy Ghost, through the heauenly doctrine at
the commandement of Christ they gathered
à Church, &amp; by wonderful miracles confirmed
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same their doctrine according to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> promise
of our Sauiour: which thing Isaiah prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied
of 600. yeares afore it came to passe. For
in his 8. chapter thus he saith: <hi>Behold I and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:19032:34"/>
the children whome the Lorde hath giuen mee,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Isai. 8, 18.</note>
                  <hi>are as signes &amp; as wonders in Israël by the Lord
of hostes which dwelleth in mount Zion.</hi> What
wonder I pray you, is greater? what signe
more euident, than that the Apostles by their
workes, being for number fewe, for power
weake &amp; fraile, for knowledge simple, should
worke miracles, and turne both the tongues
and the wil of men vnto them, &amp; to their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion?
These are the children that are giuen to
the church in stede of the auncient fathers, as
the Psalmist doth say, <hi>In steede of thy fathers
shal thy children be: thou shalt make them prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
through al the earth.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psa. 45, 16.</note> When hee nameth

Therefore for somuch as the kingdome of
Christ is gouerned by the worde,<note place="margin">Kingdome of Christ how gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note> they are
princes which by the worde and heauenlie

although the Church was first builded of the

it is gathered from the Gentiles, euen
from that barren, and altogether vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

speaketh after this manner: <hi>Reioyce ô barren

                  <hi>Which thing as we nowe see it
come to passe: so was it long before propheci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Prophet Isaiah in his 65. chapter,

the Minor of the proposed argument,

                  <hi>but grace and
truth came by Iesus Christ,</hi> that is, the thinges
which Moses by figures shadowed, and the

in truth hath fulfilled. The summe of al is this,
howe Iesus the sonne of Marie is the verie

What madnes is it sooner to beleeue the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged

the resurrection of the Lord? To be briefe, the

which foure thinges we confesse were

               <p>The first thing therefore which they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect,<note place="margin">The first ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of the Iewes.</note>

Therefore that your Iesus,<note place="margin">The conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</note> is not the Messiah.</p>
               <p>The maior they proue by the saieng of the

after this forme of the time of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Messiah:
<hi>It shal be in the last daies,</hi>

                  <hi>that the mountaine of

not what is written both afore &amp; after in books, he
peruerteth the words of the liuing God.</hi> For had
they here co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pared y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prophecie of Isaiah with
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> prophecie of Daniel, wherin as it were with
à finger by most euident words y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time of the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:19032:37"/>
comming of the Messiah is pointed-vnto,
surely farre otherwise theie would haue defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the last dayes.</p>
               <p>A daie is vnderstoode three manner of
waies.<note place="margin">A daie ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken diuers<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie.</note> First for the time wherein the sunne is
ouer our Horizon,<note place="margin">An artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al daie.</note> which the Astronomers cal
an artificial daie. Secondlie, it is taken for the
space of 24. houres from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rising of the sunne
vnto the rising-againe of the same,<note place="margin">A natural daie.</note> and that is
called à daie natural. Last of all some certaine
time ordeined, decreed, and appointed for
some speciall thing: in which sense the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes
vnderstand it manie times. Therefore
when the Prophet saith, <hi>In the last daies,</hi> he
noteth the last times, that is the last age of the
world, distinguished fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the other ages not so
much by à certaine, and described number of
yeeres, as by à separation of thinges done in
the same. So did Elias distinguish the worlde
into three times or ages, when he saide: <hi>Two
thousand voide; two thousand the Lawe; two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
the Messiah:</hi> And therefore according to
the computation of Elias, the last time of the
worlde is the space of two thousand yeeres.
Read the Chronicles of Philip Melancton.</p>
               <p>Againe, the last daies are oftentimes taken
by the prophets for the last time of the Iewish
kingdome, and nation in Palestine. So that the
sense of the Prophet is this: it shal be in the
last daies, not of worldlie time (for who should
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:19032:37"/>
haue reaped anie benefit by fauour so long put
of? surelie verie few.) but in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> last daies of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie,
of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kingdom, &amp; of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Priesthod, which
three things ceased when y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sacrifice of Christ
was finished. A vaine fiction therefore is it of
the Iewes which they make about the time
of the Messiah inuented contrarie to their ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
conscience. But this they faine to delude
such as are ignorant of the maner of the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
in distinguishing times.</p>
               <p>The second thing which they obiect,<note place="margin">The 2. Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of the Iewes.</note> is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> form of the kingdom of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Messiah pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised,

is not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> true Messiah promised by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prophets.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But against these let vs oppose an immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueable
foundation,<note place="margin">The answer</note> whereof we will conclude,
that such thinges as corporaly be ascribed,
ought spiritualie to be vnderstoode through
comparing earthlie with heauenlie thinges.
The foundation is this,<note place="margin">Kingdome of Christe what.</note> The kingdome of the
Messiah is not an earthlie but an heauenlie &amp;
spiritual kingdom: which maie be gathered by
the first promise made of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Messiah to come.
For the Messiah was promised that he should
come to destroie the kingdome of Satan.
For thus it is in the firste promise:<note place="margin">Gen. 3, 15.</note> 
                  <hi>The
seede of the woman shal breake the serpentes head,</hi>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:19032:38"/>
that is, the Messiah shal destroie the workes
of the diuel, namelie sinne and death, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store
to man y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> image of God; which through
sinning he had lost, that is, as Daniel doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same,<note place="margin">Dan. 9, 24.</note> 
                  <hi>shal bring-in euerlasting righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes,</hi>
and blessing vpon such as acknowledge
him to be King.<note place="margin">Gen. 22, 18.</note> And therefore it is written, <hi>In
thie seede shal al the nations of the earth be bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.</hi>
Of this ground we doe firmelie conclude,
that whatsoeuer by the holie Prophetes of
God is fore-tolde touching the raigne of the
Messiah after the similitude of an earthlie
kingdome,<note place="margin">Kingdome of Christ is à spiritual kingdome.</note> ought to be applied by waie of
comparison, according to the manner of à spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
kingdome, to signifie that in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of Christ there should be equalitie, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corde,
and wonderfull peace, peace I meane
agreeing to the kingdome of Christ, namelie à
spiritual peace, and that in and among such
as by true faith receiue Christe into them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues.
Which spiritual peace is signified by
the concorde of the beastes, whereof the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes
doe speake.<note place="margin">Office of the Messiah.</note> For it is too too foolishe to
thinke y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the office of the Messiah is to change
the natures of thinges, as to make the Lion
laie-awaie his crueltie; or the Aspe, and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>katrice
their poison. So then vnder these fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures
the Prophets doe signifie, howe men
that are fierce, bolde, and cruel, as Lions, if
once theie take vpon their shoulders, <hi>the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:19032:39"/>
and light yoke of Christ,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 11, 29 30.</note> that is, doe imbrace
the doctrine of Christ, and through faith de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pende
vpon him, must needes laie-awaie their

come to passe in Christ, who euen among his

               <p>The 4.<note place="margin">The 4. argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Iewes.</note> thing which the brainsicke Iewes do

Israel: That theie thinke to be the proper
inheritance of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Messiah; to it onelie, theie wil
stand in it, that the promises were made.</p>
               <p>But miserablie theie both are deceaued,
and do deceaue.<note place="margin">The answer.</note> I confesse, the verie carnal
Israelites were chosen before al other nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and was called the peculiar people of
God. But wherefore I beseech you? For their
merites and worthinesse? Not so. But that
there might be à people that might kepe the
lawe of God, in whome and from whom the
Messiah might be borne. In consideration of
which excellencie of God, Dauid saith in the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:19032:40"/>
147. Psalme,<note place="margin">Psa. 147, 20</note> 
                  <hi>He hath not dealt so with euerie

But what? Hath God, changing his minde,
taken to him selfe the idolatrous Gentiles and

God is vnchangeable, for he is faithful in his
promises: but he hath à condition of faith
and obedience annexed. And therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of their incredulitie the Iewes are cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awaie.
For they haue despised the worde of
God, and rebelliouslie reiected the Messiah
sent vnto them for their welfare: which thing
doubtles the Prophetes concealed not from
vs. What is that which the Prophet Isaiah in
his tenth chapter doth say?<note place="margin">Isai. 10, 22.</note> 
                  <hi>Though thy people,
ô Israel, be as the sande of the sea, yet shal the rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of them returne.</hi> What is more euident
than this prophecie? Hath not the euent plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
agreed to these wordes? But how commeth
it about that they are not conuerted? Whose
faulte is it? The same Prophet sheweth
wherein it lieth, whose wordes let vs heare:
<hi>I haue spreade out my handes al the daie vnto a
rebellious people.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Isai. 65, 2.</note> But whence came that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion?
Surelie from nothing els, but euen
because they were offended at the basenesse
of the person of the Messiah. Which thing the
same Prophet fore-saw would come to passe.
For thus he saith: <hi>Beholde I laie in Zion à stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:19032:41"/>
stone, and à rocke to make men fal:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 9, 33.</note> 
                  <hi>and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie
one that beleeueth on him, shal not be asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Who is the true Israel.</note>
Mine aunswere then vnto the obiection
is: Israel is the people of the Messiah; which
is verie true being vnderstod of the true Israel
which is not of the flesh, but of the promise.
But Israel of the promise is euerie one which
beleeueth: which thing in holie scripture is
declared by sundrie types and figures. Ishma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,
and Izhak were borne of one father Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham:
Esau and Iaakob of the same father Iz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hak.
But as Izhak and Iaakob for the promise
sake are reputed for the seede, without anie
respect had vnto the prerogatiue of the fleshe:
so euerie one which beleeueth the promise is
counted for the seede, as Paul in the 9. 10.
and 11. chapters vnto the Romanes doeth at
large and euidentlie prooue. For in these
three chapters the Apostle handleth the same
argument which we doe in this place. And
therefore I send-backe the hearers vnto Paul,
who by strong argumentes refuteth the erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
definition of Israel, and confirmeth the
true, which in times passed was shadowed in
the olde Testament. Whereof the Apostle
concludeth,<note place="margin">Rom 10, 12</note> howe there is none ods, howe
<hi>there is no difference betweene the Iewe and the
Grecian. For he that is Lord ouer al, is right vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
al,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">13.</note> 
                  <hi>that cal-vpon him. For whosoeuer shal cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon
the name of the Lorde, shal be saued.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:19032:41"/>
Therefore without any respect had either vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
nations or persons, the Lorde without ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation
of persons is liberal vnto al. For <hi>he
is the God not of the Iewes onelie,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>but also of the
Gentiles,</hi> who, as he reiecteth al disobedient
ones: so of his meere mercie he receiueth such
as flie vnto him according to the vnchangea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
rule of his eternal decree. As touching the
vocation of the Gentiles into the place of the
disobedient Iewes, the Prophet Hosea in his
2. chapter did fore-tel,<note place="margin">Hos. 2, 23.</note> 
                  <hi>I wil saie to them which
were not my people,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom 9, 25. 26.</note> 
                  <hi>Thou art my people: and her,

                  <hi>which was not beloued. And it shalbe

not my people, that there they shal be called, The
children of the liuing God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And touching that which the Iewes ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
of the ignominie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> crosse, wherby they
are offended, it is by the testimonies of the

Viues, which are these:</hi> But, saith he, doe
these foure, <hi>to wit Euangelistes,</hi> differ at anie

Chrysostome aunswereth on this wise. Smal dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeing
in the Gospels sometime doe offer argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the trueth, least otherwise they might
seeme to haue written of composition, if in al
respectes they shoulde agree. Iohn the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
was at Ephesus at that same time when Paul
was, yet neither maketh mention of other in their
Epistles, neither did they meete much and talke-together,
seeing they were sufficientlie enough
taught, instructed, and armed as it were of the
spirite of God, that they might not be thought af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
they had communicated-together one after
an others counsel to haue preached Christ: but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the doctrine of Christ himselfe, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelation
from heauen: so that in the principles &amp;
summe they disagree no whit, as that Christe is
the sonne of God, borne of the virgin Marie, and
that he worked miracles, taught to contemne this
worlde, to beleeue, to loue both God and man; that
he called all men vnto euerlasting happinesse, and
suffered, died, rose againe, ascended into heauen,
sitteth at the right hande of his father, and shal
come to iudge the quicke and the deade. These
thinges with one voice, and with one minde they
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:19032:42" rendition="simple:additions"/>
doe constantlie reporte and teach. Albeit in cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
which the Grecians cal Perestaseis, the
which alter not the substance of matter, they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
sometime. One sheweth à thing brieflie, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
more at large. One telleth howe two were
healed, another howe three: One at the comming
out at the gate, another at the going in. Which
thing falleth-out manie-times, because the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
of Christ were so manie, that those thinges
which in deed were diuerse, we think are the same
by reason of some resemblance which they haue
together: and so it falleth-out in the wordes and
sentences of doctrine. Christe vttered the same
things in diuerse places diuerslie. One telleth what
he saide on this wise, others what he said in that
place after another forme, to speake plainelie they
gather peeces of the sermons, and wordes of Christ
which maie make for our instruction, and welfare.</p>

owne too, sheweth them no friuolous, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porarie,
or base signe, as they required, but à
great, à wonderful, and an euerlasting signe
of the resurrection of his bodie, whiche
should be the third daie after his death:
which bodie of his was more truelie and
aptlie the Temple of GOD, than that
stonie one of Ierusalem. For therein
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:19032:45"/>
dwelleth à more proper,<note place="margin">Against the 7. crime.</note> and present God.</p>
               <p>The seuenth crime which theie obiect to
our Lorde is, that he cast-out diuels in the
name of Beelzebub the chiefe of the diuels.
Which fault by strong argumentes he remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
from himselfe, Matth. 12, and Luke 11.</p>
               <p>But afore I shew how the faithlesse Iewes
do blemish the miracles of Christ,<note place="margin">Of miracles in general.</note> I will in
fewe wordes declare what is meant by diuine
miracles. Next I wil briefelie shewe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> markes,
wherebie the diuine miracles of Christ, and of
the saintes are distinguished from fained mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
of magicians, and diuels. For the diuel
as one that hateth God, and would gladlie
turn vs from God by al possible meanes, both
by him-selfe,<note place="margin">The Diuel an inuitator of God, and his workes.</note> and his ministers the magicians,
doth emulate the workes of God, and especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alie
miracles, because he seeth howe that thing
commeth neerest vnto the diuine power
which is aboue nature. And therefore as by his
owne natural force he is mightier, so in the
knowledge of the virtues and operation of
thinges more skilfull than man, he easelie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guileth
our senses to deceaue, and bring vs
from the truth.</p>
               <p>Diuine miracles are such as God wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth:<note place="margin">Diuine mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles wha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>;</note>
which are therefore called miracles, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> theie bring men into admiration.<note place="margin">Effectes of diuine mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles.</note> For
first theie bring men into the admiration of
Gods power wherebie miracles are wrought.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:19032:45"/>
Secondly through the power of God men <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
gather that the person which doth miracles,
both is sent of GOD, and also bringeth
Gods worde, for confirmation whereof mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
are shewed, as moste euident demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations.
Thirdly through this conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
faith is conceaued in the minde, of the
doctrine; albeit the maiestie of the doctrine
doth exceede the reach of reason. Fourthlie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
of credit to the doctrine springeth in the hart
à confidence of the promise of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> good things
which are brought by the doctrine. Fiftlie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
who so beleeue the doctrine, and hope for the
promise, they do loue, and praise God. And
by miracles, as it were by the hand they are
led vnto the faith of their condition, which
is to haue felowship with God, and in him to
obteine an euerlasting blessednesse for euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.
Sixtlie, because euerie signe is à signe of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>
somthing signed, faith seeketh the analogie &amp;
comparison betwene the signe and that is sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and so by comparing them together of
earthlie gathereth heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>lie, &amp; spiritual things
of visible. For the diuine miracles of Christ
aboue al haue spiritual significatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s: the which,
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> aptlie they may be aplied, shold be reduced
vnto more euident sentences of scripture, and
notable examples, that the spiritual interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
may be agreeable to faith, and consent
with the principle groundes of our religion,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:19032:46"/>
yea and also haue euident examples wherebie
the matter is painted out as it were.</p>
               <p>The reason whie Christe and good men
would confirme their doctrine to men by mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,<note place="margin">The reson whie mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles were wrought.</note>
is this. It was verie meete that faith,
which is of matters that exceede mans vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
should be confirmed by such things
as are aboue nature, and contrarie vnto the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual
course of the same, that men with their
outwarde eies beholding such thinges to be
brought to passe as exceeded the power of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
might be stirred-vp to the beholding
with the internal eies of the minde, that is, to
the beleeuing of those thinges which are
beyonde reason. As therefore the thinges
which are subiect to reason neede no demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration,
that an vndoubted faith may be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
to them: so diuine and celestial, by mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
as by certaine heauenlie proofes, do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue
credite.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nowe the cause why at this daie miracles
are not wrought in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> eies of men,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Whie mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles ar not wrought.</note> 
                  <hi>as they haue
bin, Augustine sheweth when he saith:</hi> Neither
be these miracles permitted to indure vnto our
daies, that the minde maie not alwaies seeke after
visible thinges, and so by the longe vse of them
mankinde would waxe colde, which through their
noueltie was inflamed. Neither ought we in these
daies to doubte that theie are to be credited, who,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:19032:46"/>
when theie preached those things, which fewe at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine-vnto,
could for all that persuade the people
howe theie were to be folowed.</p>
               <p>Hitherto generalie haue we spoken of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenlie
miracles,<note place="margin">Howe to knowe the true from false mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> now come we vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> markes,
wherebie diuine are distinguished from diue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,
and true from from fained miracles. The
notes are sixe, namelie the truth of the nature,
the power, the manner of doing, the efficient
cause, the cause mouing before it be wrought,
and the ende. By these notes as it were by à
touch-stone miracles aswell of Christ and of
the Saintes, namelie diuine, as fained and dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical
as of Magicians, and inchanters, are
to be examined.</p>
               <p>For the first therefore.<note place="margin">The 1. note.</note> The truth of the es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
is to be considered. All the miracles of
Christ haue the trueth of the essence, that is,
are such in deede as theie seeme to be. Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus<note place="margin">Lazarus.</note>
had lien foure daies in the graue,<note place="margin">Iohn 11, 17.</note> &amp; stoonk
againe, therefore without doubt he was dead.
Therefore Christ raising him from the dead,
wrought à true miracle in deede. For beeing
raised he liued truelie, he eate and dranke,
wherebie manie Iewes, that knew him marue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
much at the miracle. Neither was there
wanting which sought to kil Lazarus, that
so theie might either blemishe, or denie the
dead.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:19032:47"/>
And therfore it was à true miracle. But the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
of the diuel,<note place="margin">Miracles of the diuel how wroght</note> and of magicians are done
by iuggling and deluding the eies, as those
were in times passed that happened in Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daurus
and els where, or by secret, and natural
philosophie. For the diuel who exactlie &amp;
perfectlie knoweth both the nature &amp; power
of things, can secretlie applie either herbes or
stones, the effect whereof is counted of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
men for a miracle, albeit it be the worke
of nature.</p>
               <p>The second note,<note place="margin">The second marke.</note> whereby true miracles
are knowne from false, is the power whereby
theie are wrought, the which if it exceede the
power of nature, is doubtles diuine, and the
miracles so done haue God for the author of
them.<note place="margin">How to knowe by what power a miracle is wrought.</note> This diuine power may diuerslie be
seene in the miracles both of the Saintes, and
of Christ himself. First in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> verie action, as for
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> su<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne to staie his course, or to returne fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the
west vnto the East;<note place="margin">Ios. 10, 12. 13.</note> for a man to walke vpon
the waters, as vppon drie land, which thing
we reade our Sauiour to haue done.<note place="margin">Mat. 14. 25</note> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
in the subiect vppon whom the deede is
done,<note place="margin">Matt. 9, 27. 28. 29</note> as to giue to the blinde sight, and life
to the dead.<note place="margin">Iohn. 9, 1. 2. &amp; 32. 34. &amp;</note> For nature may giue both light,
and life too, but not either to the blinde or to
the dead, as our Sauiour did. Thirdlie by the
order also and manner wherby they are done,<note place="margin">Mat. 8, 26.</note>
as suddenlie to cease à tempest,<note place="margin">Matt. 14, 32</note> and the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:19032:47"/>
sea, suddenlie to heale the sicke. So do
we reade our Sauiour Christe to haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
the windes and the sea, and the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pests
which forth-with obeied him,<note place="margin">Luke. 5, 12. 13.</note> &amp; manie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes
euen with à becke, and suddenlie to
haue healed leapers and others.<note place="margin">Mark. 9 33 34.</note> Fourthlie by
the worker, as to behold the heartes of men,
which thing belongeth onlie vnto God.<note place="margin">Luke 9. 46. 47.</note> How
often I pray you do we reade that Christ sawe
the verie cogitations, sometyme of his owne
disciples,<note place="margin">Iohn. 9, 6. 11.</note> somtyme of his aduersaries? Fiftlie
by the instrument wherwithal the miracle is
done, as with claie to restore sight to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> blind,
wheras claie naturalie wil make blinde rather,
but the Lord vsed claie in healing the blind,
that the curing might seeme to proceede not
from nature, but from the God of nature.
And so Christ did worke al sortes of miracles,
that if anie man, as the mindes of men are very
diuers, should suspect or not be throughlie
persuaded in some one, so manie and so diuers
were added, that now al matter and occasion
of doubting is quite remoued: so y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> none may
dout whether y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> miracles of Christ were done
by the power of God. But neither the diuel,
nor anie other power that is finite can worke
such miracles.<note place="margin">Diuels can worke no miracles.</note> And although manie thinges
do seeme to be miracles: yet in truth theie are
not, because they be wrought by the power of
nature, as by herbs or some other thing, which
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:19032:48"/>
the diuel secretlie can applie. And therefore
manie thinges are done which are knowen to
the skilful in the nature of thinges, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rude
people accounte for miracles: as are those
thinges which are done by Art magike, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
also we haue noted.</p>
               <p>The thirde note followeth,<note place="margin">The 3. note.</note> to wit the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of working miracles.<note place="margin">Matt. 8, 26, 27</note> Sometime Christ by
onely commanding, shewed miracles, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
how he was the Lorde of nature;<note place="margin">Iohn. 11, 41.</note> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
he did so by inuocation, to giue men to
vnderstand from whome he had all thinges,
and also to meete with their slander who said
that in the name of Beelzebub, the chiefe of
the diuels, he cast-out diuels; somtime by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vse
of one thing or another,<note place="margin">Iohn 9, 6.</note> as by clay or spittle, to
shew that God worketh somtime by meanes,
&amp; somtime with-out means, somtime contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
to the nature of the meanes, sometimes tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
the touching of his garment, sometime
by his onelie pleasure being absent.<note place="margin">Matt. 9, 20.</note> But the
illusions of diuels which haue likenes of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,<note place="margin">Mat. 14, 35. 36.</note>
are done after foolish and verie ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
meanes,<note place="margin">Mark. 7, 29 30</note> whereby it maie easelie be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued
who is the author of them.<note place="margin">Luk. 7, 6, 7, &amp; 10</note> For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> diuel,
that no man maie suspect them to be done by
the power of nature, commandeth wordes to
be vsed that agree nothing at al to the matter,
as if an horse be to be healed, these wordes are
to be said, <hi>The sea is salt, and frosen in the Winter,</hi>
and some such thing more absurd. Somtime y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:19032:48"/>
woulfe putteth on à lambes skin, and wil haue
the wordes of the holie Scripture to be vsed,
as some verse of the Psalter to be recited; or
à sentence out of the Gospel to be hung about
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> necke; or à Masse or moe to be said, &amp; som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
he wil haue beanes or other things to be
put vnder an holie clout of lynen. But who
can bring al his toies into remembrance, the
which are better knowen to the bond-slaues
of Satan, than to the godlie.</p>
               <p>The 4. note is the efficient cause.<note place="margin">The 4. note.</note> Christ at no
time sought occasion to work miracles, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
vsed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> offered. He tooke neither
time nor place to shewe his cunning: but sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denlie
alwaies, &amp; according to the matter mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred.
But y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> diuel, &amp; deluders of the simple
seeke both time &amp; place conuenient for their
iuggling, and haue their certain preparations.
Againe Christ who excelled in true holines
wrought miracles both by him selfe, &amp; by his
good and godlie disciples: but Satan doth his
fained miracles by wicked, by naughtie perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s,
witches, vncleane men, by wisemen, by fairies,
by the reprobate, who no man can doubt, doe
worke by guile, and fradulentlie.</p>
               <p>The fifte note,<note place="margin">The 5. note.</note> is the cause mouing before
the thing be don. The Sonne of God, &amp; other
good men at no time respected their own co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie,
but the profite of others; y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it might
appeare how in their miracles they sought not
their own glorie, but were brought ther-vnto
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:19032:49" rendition="simple:additions"/>
through the approbation of their faith, who
required them, that men might vse to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
God, and them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but wise-men, the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
of Sathan, either seeke profite, or vaine
pleasure, or either to moue foolishe men to
laughter, delectation, and admiration; or to
terrifie them.</p>
               <p>The sixt note is,<note place="margin">The 6. note</note> the ende. Christ at no
time wrought any corporal miracle, but it had
manie spiritual significations, whereof the
bookes of diuines intreate at large: but the il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusions
of the diuel are comprised within
the bounds of vaine ostentation.</p>
               <p>These thinges I thought good briefelie to

miracles, that al the worlde might see howe

               <p>ALthough the madnes of the Turkes doth

               <p>And although diuers Prophets haue fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told
of the wickednes &amp; tyrannie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Turks:
yet in this place we wil onelie recite the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie
of Daniel which he hath in his 7. chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
the which is verie notable, and agreeth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specialie
vnto the tyme when this impietie &amp;
tyrannie did begin.<note place="margin">Dan. 7. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>After this,</hi> saith Daniel, <hi>I
saw in the visions by night, and beholde, the fourth
beaste, was fearful, and terrible, and verie strong:
It had great iron teeth; it deuoured and brake in
peeces and stamped the residue vnder his feete:
and it was vnlike to the beastes that were before
it: for it had tenne hornes.</hi> Hetherto spake Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel
of the fourth, that is the Romaine Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
and of the crueltie of the same, and of the
tenne kinges in subiection thervnto: Now fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
the prophecie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Turkish kingdom
in these wordes:<note place="margin">8.</note> 
                  <hi>As I considered the hornes,
beholde, there came vp among them another litle
horne, before whom there were three of the first
hornes pluckt-awaie, and behold, in this horne
were eies like the eies of man, and à mouth speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
presumptuous thinges.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">23.</note> And afterwarde,
<hi>The fourth beast shalbe the fourth kingdome in the
earth, which shalbe vnlike to al the kingdomes, and
shal deuoure the whole earth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">24.</note> 
                  <hi>and shal treade it
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:19032:52"/>
downe and break it in peeces.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">24.</note> 
                  <hi>And the ten hornes:
out of this kingdom are ten kings that shal rise: &amp;
another shal rise after the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; he shalbe vnlik to the

                  <note place="margin">25.</note> 
                  <hi>&amp; he shal subdue three kings. And shal speak
words against the most high, and shal consume the
saints of the most high, &amp; think that he may chang
times and lawes.</hi> Hitherto Daniel, whose pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie
the euent hath proued to be true. For
in the yeare of Christ 623. Heraclius being
Emperour, Mahomet moued sedition, and
foorth-with the Saracens or Arabians ioined
together these three dominions Egypt, Syria,
and Africa, which are the three hornes pluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
from those tenne hornes of the fourth
beast. And Daniel ascribeth to this litle horne,
that is to the Turkish Empire, three notes,
whereby it may be knowne. The first where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
is à newe lawe contrarie to the law of God.
For the eies doe signifie à law subtillie inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.<note place="margin">Markes of the Turkish Empire.</note>
The seconde marke is, Blasphemie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the most high, which is Christ. For the
mouth speaking words against the true God,
signifieth blasphemies against the sonne of
God. The thirde note is, crueltie towards the
Church: <hi>And he shal consume,</hi> saith he, <hi>the
sainctes of the most high.</hi> The fourth is, an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuor
to abolish y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Gospel, &amp; the Church. <hi>He
shal think</hi> saith he, <hi>that he may change times and
lawes.</hi> God would haue this prophecie to be
extant for à strengthening of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> godlie against
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:19032:52"/>
the crueltie of the Turks: y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> when they should
see the euent to answere to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prophecie, they
might not offend at the stumbling-blocke of
so great persecution, and of such reuolting
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the true Church. And therefore being thus
fore-warned by the Prophet, let vs take heart
to our selues against this Turkish tyrannie, &amp;
wickednes, especiallie seeing howe the euent
hath answered to the prophecie. For there
haue foure Monarchies bin one after another.
Now raigneth à people which are enemies to
God, that openlie doeth abolish the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical,
and Apostolical scriptures.</p>
               <p>But how sprang-vp this newe kingdome?<note place="margin">2. Howe the Turkes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, &amp;c.</note>
who was the autor? who toke his part? Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met
in his youth by reason of his pouertie li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
by theft and robberie, afterward hauing
heaped much riches together, he was à souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
among his contrie-men the Arabiansvnder
Heraclius. In y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> war he found occasion of prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalitie,
and power. For when the Arabians,
being offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded with Heraclius for denieng the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
their paie, &amp; for his religion, had seuered the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, Mahomet ioined himself to the

y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperor, &amp; encouraged the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in their

(as they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monlie are extoled in euerie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion
which fauour the wicked enterprise
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:19032:53"/>
of the rebellious people, and set vppon the
mightie &amp; gouernours.) In this new capitane
manie could not abide y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> basenes of his birth,
nor the odiousnes of his former life, especialie
they loathed him for a disease he had, which
was the falling sicknes. He therfore to redeeme
himselfe from this contempt, which is an easie
matter amonge the foolish common people,
pretended à diuinitie in his doinges, faining
himselfe to enter communication with God,
and so when he talked, to be rauished out of
himselfe, and seemed like vnto one afflicted
with the falling sicknes. And therfore he said
plainlie, but vntrulie, howe he was no more
à capitane, and prince elected through the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uor
of souldiors, but à prophet, and a messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of the almightie God, that vnder the shew
of diuinitie he might haue al men the more
obedient to his wordes. But forsomuch as he
was rude altogether and vnlearned, he adioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to him selfe two masters and counselers
that were Christians, the one wherof was
Sergius an Arian,<note place="margin">Sergius the Arrians. Nestorians.</note> and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other Iohn Nestorius,
to whom there came à third, who was à Iewe,
à Thalmudiste. Euerie of which defended his
seueral sect. Whervppon Mahomet sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
that he should not onelie gratifie his
companions, but also the more easilie allure
al nations vnto himselfe, receiued al, that is,
the pertinacie of Arius, the error of Nestorius,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:19032:53"/>
and the vaine inuentions of the Thalmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diste.
And therefore he receaued from the
Iewe circumcision; from the Christians sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie
washinges as it were Baptismes; and
with Sergius he denied the diuinitie of Christ.
Nowe some worshipped idols; others were
baptized, and some-what instructed in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianitie,
who, as soone as theie had left the
Romane Emperour for the hatred they bare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him, renounced foorth-with the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
which he defended. Euen after the
example of those tenne tribes of Israel, which
reuolting from the house of Dauid vnto Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam,
despised the lawes of their fathers, and
went from the seruice of the onelie true God
vnto the inuocation of Diuels.</p>
               <p>Mahomets manner to enlarge and esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish
his kingdome was this,<note place="margin">3. Howe the Turks mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied, and encreased.</note> which also his
maisters taught him: He saide howe God at
the first to mankinde sent Moses, after him
Iesus Christ, who were indued with the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to worke miracles. But men gaue smal
heede to them. Therefore he determined to
send Mahomet à warriour with-out miracles,
that whome miracles had not moued, wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons
might compel. He saide howe he was
the last messenger, and that after him none
should come; howe Christe in the Gospel
had prophecied of him, and howe tidinges
was of him through a wonderful light which
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:19032:54"/>
passed from Eua by succession of kinde tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
al women euen to his verie mother.
See the subtiltie of this knaue Mahomet, who
knowing that he was destitute altogether of
the heauenlie gift to worke miracles, which
thing was at hand, he fained he was sent with
the sworde. But this armed man at the length
was vanquished, and receaued à sore wounde
in his mouth, wherebie he lost some of his
cheeke teeth, and was throwen into à ditch,
and put to à shameful foile, and that the verie
daie before, he had from the oracle of GOD
promised victorie to him and his. Yea and
while he was yet à common theefe he was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
beaten sore of the Drianites whose
camels he set-vpon returning from Mecha.</p>
               <p>And that citie which hath him nowe in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
sometime adiudged him vnto death, as
à verie hurtful theefe, and appointed à reward,
if anie coulde bring him vnto them either
quicke or deade. This champion of the
Lord (for sooth) first à theefe, afterward à se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious
souldier; then a runne-agate, after
that à capitane of à rebellious hoste, perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth

howe he is the messenger of God; wherebie
we maie gather howe greate the power of
Satan is in them, whiche imbrace not the

               <p>Whereof it is that at this daie that aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:19032:54"/>
of God defendeth his blasphemies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
God by Turkishe and Mahometical
force, according to the prophecie of Daniel.</p>
               <p>It foloweth that we speake of the lawes of
Mahomet,<note place="margin">4. The lawes of Mahome<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> which are partlie political, &amp; part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
ceremonial or of seruice: but of these I wil
touche verie fewe, wherebie it wil be easie
to iudge of the rest. First of al, to his Arabians,
that is, to poore men, accustomed to liue vpon
the spoile, he aloweth theft, and setteth à
lawe of reuengement. <hi>Hurt him,</hi> saith he, <hi>which
hurt you.</hi> He saith also, <hi>He that either killeth his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie,
or is killed by his enemie entreth into Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise.</hi>
He permitteth men to haue manie wiues.
He aloweth diuorcement for a trifeling cause,
and receauing againe vpon smal occasion.
Nowe, I praie you, what is more against na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
than such lawes, if theie maie be caled
lawes which peruert the lawe of nature, that
is common to all men? On the otherside he
hath giuen some lawes which make to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
of loue and goodwil among men. He
commandeth almes to be giuen, and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
paradise to such as giue liberalie, if so be

enemies. He willeth punishment to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
to the poore for their offences: But to the
good law he annexeth impietie, namelie how
therebie theie doe merite remission of sinnes.
He hath ceremonies, washings, &amp; circumcisio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>;
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:19032:55"/>
fiue times in à daie he compelleth his to

no whit, seeing theie are voide of the
propiciatorie, without which there is none

               <p>The fables which he intermixeth,<note place="margin">5. Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets fables.</note> as diuine

which I wil recite foure, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> by them the rest,
as the Lion by his talantes, maie be iudged.
This stout souldior of the Lord, Mahomet by
name, telleth how by the conduction of Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briel
the Angel he ascended into heauen to
talke with God. Where first of al meeteth
with him an Angel ten thousand times huger
than the whole worlde: for whome he got à
pardon of God, whom he had offended, bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
requested<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to make intercession vnto God
for him. Which done, God put his hand vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
Mahomet, whereby he was stroken with
so extreme à colde, that it pearced vnto the
verie marrowe of his backe. He saide that
God was carried in à chaire by eight Angels,
whose head he vainelie reporteth is of such à
bignes, that the swiftest birde that is, in a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
yeeres can-not flie from one part thereof
vnto an other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The second fable like the same,</hi>

                  <hi>where-vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon

There was <hi>saith he,</hi> two Angels of God, namelie,

Horroth and Marroth, sent from God on à time
from heauen into the world, appointed to gouerne
and to instruct mankinde, with these commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes,
that theie should neither kil, nor iudge vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iustlie,
nor drinke wine. So à long time theie were
so taken, and knowen to be iudges ouer the whole
worlde. Vpon à certaine daie à woman of al other

The condition they like. When she had lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the same suddenlie she was lifted-aloft and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended
into heauen. Which when GOD sawe,
and had sifted the cause, he made her the daie
star, as beautiful among the Starres as euer she
was among women. To the Angels, called before
his iudgement seate, he appointed that theie
should choose either the paines of this life, or of the
world to come; who chose the paines of this life.

Moses, saying, O thou beloued messenger of God,

He wil answere, whom cal you for? Did not I giue
you à lawe, and confirmed the same with miracles,
and yet you beleeued not? Had you beleeued me,
I woulde do what you require; but go ye vnto Iesus
Christ. Then turned vnto Christ, they shal say,
O Iesu Christ, spirit, word and power of God, let
thy mercie moue thee, &amp; go betweene God and vs.
Then shal Christ say to them, what ye require of me
your selues haue forgon. I was sent indeede to

yet went yee astray, and after I had preached to

Mahomet, vnto whom being turned theie shal say,
O thou faithful messenger and frend of God, how
greeuously haue we sinned in giuing no credit to
thy wordes, heare vs ô gratious prophet, beside
whom we haue no refuge. For after thee there is
none in whom we shal trust. Heare vs by the power
which God hath giuen thee. So Gabriel shal come
forth, and shal not suffer his frende to be of no pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,

doeth pronounce that the kingdome, and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice

of purpose reiecteth the writinges of the
Prophetes and Apostles, the which haue the
testimonies of God, and that verie manie.

cannot be that his religion is of God.</p>
               <p>The third,<note place="margin">3. Argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.</note> It is impossible that those lawes

               <p>The seuenth,<note place="margin">7. Argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t</note> That is the most auncient

there is no doubt, but the auctor of the same

They saie that nations are gouerned by

serues to that ende and for nothing else. But
this weakeneth not the power and nature of
religion,<note place="margin">Men natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralie thinke there is à God.</note> but rather confirmeth the same. For
it sheweth howe God himselfe hath ingraffed

that euen by the shewe of religion, men may
be guided as by the face of virtue, and arte of
wisedome. Nowe if any doe saie, without

Therefore that wisedome is nothing at al: who

after à certaine secrete manner, as our Lorde
doth teach in the 3. Chapter of Iohn<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
vpon holines continualie; of the crosse,
and glorie of the Church; of death, and resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
from death; &amp; of the true God, which
is the Father, the Sonne, and the holie Ghost,
which true and onelie God, theie are bounde,
being receaued into the Church, to worship
with true holinesse both here in this world, &amp;
after the resurrection for euermore. This true
Church in the first Epistle of Iohn, and also in
the Apostolical Creede, is caled <hi>The commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of Saintes,</hi> that is, the felowship of al men
that are sanctified in Iesus Christ, through the

<pb n="107" facs="tcp:19032:66"/>
we beleeue the worde of the Gospel, and by à
liuelie faith rest our selues vpon the Lorde of
Hostes, which is Iesus Christe. And that the
true Church is as we saie, it maie be proued by
that notable example of our Father Abraham.
For he at such time as he was in Chaldea,<note place="margin">Abraham à paterne of the true Church.</note>
heard the voice of the Lorde, and obeied him;
being caled out of Hur of the Chaldeans, &amp;
from the companie of idolaters, he seuered
&amp; separated himselfe from the wicked world,
both in heart, in wil, in faith, in obedience
toward God, and in confession. Where-vnto
the name of the Church doth fitlie agree.<note place="margin">Fruite ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered from the e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

as the Grecians caled that companie, which
by à common crier was called from the other
people, to heare the minde of the Senate,
à Churche; so the Apostles take the Churche
of Christ for that companie of men which by
the preachers of the worde are called from the

So that whosoeuer disioineth himselfe

Church, and à partaker of al the good thing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

And although greate is the weakenesse
of al men,<note place="margin">Howe the faithful be holie.</note> and manifolde flames of wicked
affections do often arise, yea in the verie god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
against which in spirite theie doe contend:
yet he abideth in the Church, &amp; is holie, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
keepeth faith &amp; à good conscience, or
à good purpose. For as the conscience beeing

there is à good conscience, there is faith, by
which we enioie the most excellent of al trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
euen the righteousnes of Christ, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bie
we please God.<note place="margin">No respect of persons before God.</note> Neither must we thinke
vpon anie difference here either of nations,
persons, or sexe. For faith maketh al alike,
as touching the right of the kingdome. And
although diuers and sundrie be the giftes: yet
serue theie al for the vnitie of the Church.
This vnitie of the true Church gathered out
of manie and sundrie nations,<note place="margin">Vnitie of the Church like vnto a pome-gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate.</note> as it were into

and murther the members of the same, let vs

                  <hi>My sheepe heare my

This is à special note wherebie the Church of
Christ is distinguished from other assemblies.</p>
               <p>By whiche we are admonished to shunne
false-christes, and false-prophetes euen as
we would the verie diuel him-selfe: For
this alwaie is the scope of Satan, namelie that,
despising the voice of the Lorde, we should
hearken vnto him. For, as he enuironed our
first parents by sophistrie, and deprauing the
worde of God: so alwaies he laboureth to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trap
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:19032:68"/>
the Church: after the same sorte, and
maner. And therfore it standeth vs vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aboue
al to listen-vnto the voice of our sheepheard,
despising the voice of strangers, by whom the
diuel speaketh. So then when the Papistes doe
bid vs to heare them, let vs answer that Christ
our shepheard hath commanded to heare his
voice onelie, and to content vs there-withal.
This voice of our shepheard is comprehended
in the writinges both of the Prophetes and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,
and that not obscurelie, but plainelie,
as touching the ground of our saluation. When
the Pope doth bid thee to cal vpon saintes;
shunne him as the serpent which by his lie
cast our first parentes vnto the death. For it
is contrarie to the wordes of our sheepeheard
who saith:<note place="margin">Matt. 4, 10</note>

But seeing others that are not in the Church
of God, to their certaine condemnation doe
folowe other masters, theie do more and more
estrange them-selues from God, as in the same
Psalme it is saide:<note place="margin">Psal. 73, 37</note>

to cleaue vnto the Lorde of Hostes? It is by
faith to be espoused, and by hope, confession;
and obedience according to his worde,<note place="margin">To cleaue vnto the Lorde of hostes, what;</note> to be
ioined to him. For as by faith we receaue him,

as it were depending to a trustie anchor.
Whereof we are carried-into his commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

I haue touched:<note place="margin">How we are holie and pure in this life.</note> yet who so reteineth faith
and à good conscience, is iudged pure &amp; holie
before God, and that in two respectes.</p>
               <p>First by the imputation of the holines of
Christ: secondlie by inchoation of obedience.
Wher-of it is, that in respect of the vngodlie,
&amp; vnpenitent persons, the godlie before God
are counted for moste holie, for most pure,
and perfect without al spot or wrinckle. For
God imputeth not the remnants of sinne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them, but looketh-vpon them as theie are
cloathed, and adorned with the righteousnes
of his sonne Iesus Christ.</p>
               <p>Nowe,<note place="margin">The holie seruice of God in the Church.</note> the Church being the holie Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of God, God is necessarilie to be serued in
the same, and that purelie, and holilie. And
this seruice is à worke commanded of GOD,<note place="margin">Seruice of God, what;</note>
done through faith, principalie for the glorie
of God. Then that this seruice maie be pure &amp;
holie, it is required first of all that the worke
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:19032:71"/>
of the seruice be holie, that is prescribed by
the word of God, and infected with no hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane,
or diuelish additions. For so the Lorde
by the Prophet Ieremie, doth saie: <hi>Walke in my
commandementes, and not in the commandements
of your fathers.</hi> And that the workes comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by men are not the seruice of God of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
the Prophet Isaiah teacheth when he
saith:<note place="margin">Isa. 23, 13.</note> 
                  <hi>In vaine theie worship me, teaching for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines

                  <note place="margin">Matt. 15, 9.</note> And Paule in plaine

               <p>Secondlie vnto the pure and holie seruice
of God, it is required that the minde and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science

when the minde is vnpure, it is abhomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
whatsoeuer a man doth, although to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

                  <note place="margin">16.</note> 
                  <hi>Theie professe

&amp; are abominable and disobedient,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Howe faith doth purifie the heart.</note> 
                  <hi>and vnto eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie

of man is made pure by faith, it is manifest. For
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:19032:72"/>
                  <hi>by faith,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 15, 9.</note> as witnesseth the Apostle, <hi>the heartes
be purified,</hi> not because faith of it selfe can doe
so, but for that by faith the bloud of Christe is
applied, by the sprinckling wherof our hearts
be cleansed from dead workes. Thirdlie that
the seruice of God maie be holie and pure, it
is required, that the end of the worke be pure
and holie, that is, that without al hypocrisie,
with à simple heart thou set the glorie of God
before thine eies, that is, that thou do whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
thou doe, onelie because God hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
the same to be done, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thie minde
is, with al thine affection, mind, wil, and life to
glorifie. A worke so done, is à pure and holie
seruice of God. And although the worke it
self be apparent for the most part, &amp; in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> eies
of men, verie base: yet it is a spiritual seruice of
God: because it is the work not of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> flesh, but
of the spirit, before which is proposed the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
of God. And that theie, who shal violate
this holie temple of God,<note place="margin">Punishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of such as defile the Church of God.</note> shal not escape scot-free,
this threatning of the Apostle doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare,
<hi>If anie man doth violate the Temple of God,
him wil God destroie.</hi> But this Temple is viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by idols, and vncleanes, that is by errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
doctrine,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 3, 17.</note> superstitious worshippinges,<note place="margin">Howe and whereby the church is defiled.</note>
schisme, by wickednes and prophanes of life:
who so is guiltie of anie one of these vices,
doth violate the Temple of God. What then
shal we saie of the Pope who ouerwhelmeth
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:19032:72"/>
the doctrine of the Gospel with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dreames of
Monkes; who bringeth infinite superstitions
into the church; who parteth a sunder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vnitie
of the Church by the manifolde orders of Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;
who winketh at the monstrous impuritie
of Clergie men by vsing no discipline; &amp; who
is an example himselfe to al the worlde of
wickednes, and vnholie conuersation?</p>
               <p>Furthermore by the name of Tabernacles,<note place="margin">6. The true Church in this world is in exile and banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment neuer at rest.</note>
we are put in mind of the Churches peregri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
and wandering from one place vnto a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
vntil she come vnto her true countrie.
For as tabernacles or tentes of war, be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued

seate. This pilgrimage, wherebie in deede eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
man, as Augustine doth saie, is à pilgrime in
this world, doth admonish vs of sin, which is
the cause of this peregrination. For, because of
sin we are cast with our first parents out of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise
into the land wherein we soiorne. So y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
we are remoued from Ierusalem,<note place="margin">Ierusalem</note> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is from the
sight and fruition of peace,<note place="margin">Babylon.</note> into Babylon, that
is into cónfusion, &amp; exile wherin we wander-about
far &amp; wide. And although we are al pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimes:<note place="margin">Sundrie kindes of strangers.</note>
yet the condition of al men is not like.
For some are quite out of the waie into their
cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trie, &amp; some are in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> readie way. For whoso
beleueth not, is neither in his countrie, nor in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:19032:73"/>
waie there-vnto. And he that soiourneth, and
walketh by faith, is not yet in his countrie, but
for al y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is in the right waie. This was it which
the Apostle saith,<note place="margin">Heb 13, 14.</note> 
                  <hi>We haue not here à continuing
citie: but we seeke one to come.</hi> As therefore they,
who often are enforced to change their seate
in iorneieng, must suffer manie troubles, and
quietlie put them vp: so the Church of God
in this worlde shal neuer be free from trappes,
and troubles both of men and diuels, so long as
it wandereth in the darke vales of this life.</p>
               <p>Therefore we are to walke warilie in this pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage,
and to beware of the snares of false
doctrine; of prophanes of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uersation; of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
at nouelties; leaste beeing taken with
the inticements of this worlde we forget our

y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> no rage either of Satan or of anie limme of
his shal vtterlie destroy the same. For as God
was alwaies in the tabernacles of his people in
the wildernesse, and miraculouslie did foster,
and defende them: So Christe, our capitaine
wil neuer be from his Church, according as
he hath promised,<note place="margin">Mat. 28, 20</note> 
                  <hi>I am with you vntil the ende

through the red sea; and after him Ioshua

These three thinges are diligentlie to be
distinguished, <hi>The waie, truth, life.</hi> Whereby
first of al generalie is signified, howe Christe
alone is the beginning, middle, and consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of our saluation and happinesse: and
therefore, that workes neither going before
faith, nor conioined with faith, nor yet folow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
faith, doe merite saluation, and happines.
Then particularlie the manner would be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
out of the scriptures, how Christ is the
waie; how the truth; and how the life.</p>
               <p>Howe therefore is Christ the way?<note place="margin">How Christ is the wale by doctrine.</note> He is
the way both by doctrine, and by merite, and
by example. By doctrine, in teaching vs those
thinges which tend vnto our saluation, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to that of Iohn,<note place="margin">Iohn. 1, 18.</note> 
                  <hi>No man hath seene God
at anie time: the onelie begotten sonne of God,

touching himselfe as witnesseth Peter.<note place="margin">2. Pet. 1, 21.</note>
And therefore whoso abideth in the doctrine
of Christ, abideth in the waie of saluation: but
he that wandereth from the doctrin of Christ,
runneth headlong into the way of perdition.
So then let our onely care be, to imbrace, and
defend the synceritie of the Gospel, setting-a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
al danger either of life, or goods. And let

as though we our selues had fulfilled the same.
And this is it which Paul saith,<note place="margin">Rom. 10, 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Christ is the end

as much as the law requireth, namelie righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes

                  <hi>As by one mans disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence

one, many are made righteous.</hi> And Augustine to
the same effect doth saie, <hi>Our sinnes he hath

For iustification is nothing else but an absol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing

out of the waie, according vnto that of

is beloued of God, and become amiable, in
respect of the goodnes, that is the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
and bewtie, that is the holines of Christ,
communicated vppon him. For these two
thinges, to wit, goodnes and bewtie do allure
the mindes of men to loue them who are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
therewithal. The Church then is loued
of God in the beloued, and that by reason of
the societie which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church hath with Christ.
Now for the better vnderstanding what kind
of societie it hath with Christ,<note place="margin">Societie with Christ.</note> for which the

of hostes, certaine degrees of fellowshippe
which men haue with Christ both God and

               <p>Generalie men haue a double societie
with Christ, the one whereof is not health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,<note place="margin">Vnhealthful societie of how manie, sortes.</note>
the other healthful. Of the vnhealthful
societie, there is à threefolde sort. The first
is of nature onelie, that meane whereby men
are conioned with Christ by the communion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
onelie of nature, as are al nations which know
not Christ, the infidel Iewes and Turkes.
The seconde is of nature, and of outwarde <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
professio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> onelie: when as besid natural societie
outward professio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Christian religion, is ioi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned;

faine the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues for Christians. The third is of
nature, of outwarde profession, and of the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments
onlie. This societie is of hypocrites,
who beare à color of holines without à liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
confidence in Christ.</p>
               <p>The healthful fellowship with Christ is
that,<note place="margin">Healthful societie of how manie sortes.</note> whereby men are associated to Christ,
through participation of the spirite, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of the benefites of the Mediator; and
this also is of three sortes. The first is of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
and of inward coniunction onelie. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
are they conioined to Christ who beleeue
in Christ, but yet are not knowne, as are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
both in Turkie, and vnder the Pope. The
seconde is of nature, of inwarde coniunction,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
                  <pb n="132" facs="tcp:19032:80"/>
and of outwarde profession onelie: such was
that of Cornelius before he was baptized.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The thirde is of nature, of inward coniuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
of outwarde profession, and of the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes
also: And this is the most perfect, such
is the communion of the godlie in wel refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
Churches.</p>
               <p>This societie of the Church with Christ
maketh her to be most louelie in the sight of
the Lorde of Hostes. And therefore Dauid
not without cause brake into this admiration,
<hi>O Lorde of hostes, how amiable are thy Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles!</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Num. 24, 6.</note>
And Balaam, Num. 24. <hi>How goodlie are

As the vallies,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">6.</note> 
                  <hi>are they stretched-foorth, as gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens
by the riuers side, as the aloe trees which the
Lorde hath planted.</hi> For when the Prophet
with corporal eies did behold those outward
tabernacles, by à prophetical spirite he was
carried into the contemplation of the beautie
of the Church of Christ, which in deede
is goodlie and amiable to God, in respect of
her coniunction with Christ, in whome all
which beleeue, are both righteous, and holie,
and beloued of God, and abound with al spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
giftes, looking for that blessed inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
whereof they haue for à most certaine
earnest penie, the holie spirit.</p>
               <p>Seeing then this fellowship with God in
Christ, and through Christ, is the ende of
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:19032:80"/>
good thinges, yea and mans soueraigne felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
it is meete that we haue the same in hie
price and estimation; yea, and preferre it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
al worldlie things be they neuer so deere,
and precious. Here therefore verie great heed
woulde be had, that we neither through our
owne default, nor through others, doe forgoe
the same. Through our owne default we leese
it, when we waxe slothful, either in reading,
or in meditating of the worde; or in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises
of godlines, as in praier, thankes-gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing,
frequenting the sacramentes, and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth.
For thereby the spirite of faith is que<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched,
and man ful shamefulie falleth from
this communion.</p>
               <p>Through the fault of others wee leese the
same, when either through sophistrie, or hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie,
or tyrannie, or frowardnes of the
people, or by offences vanquished we cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awaie
the confession, and breake the bande of
this heauenlie societie; and chuse to folow ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
manie that are wicked, than à fewe good.
For manie there haue beene, which for not
defending this fellowship with such à zeale,
as they were bound to doe, haue vtterlie fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
from the same, and neuer returned-againe
therevnto: such were Cain, Iudas, and Saul.</p>

Therefore as the Hart, in hunting flieth being
pursued of dogs, &amp; wearied by a long course
and drines, with al gredines desireth the fresh
waters: so the minde of Dauid, being now in
exile, ful earnestlie longed-for the fellowship
of the Church of God, wherein y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word soun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth,<note place="margin">Word of god à liuing fountaine.</note>
and praiers with sacrifices are made. For
that liuing fountaine is the word of God, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
whence true life, and liuelie consolations are
drawen. From the cisternes of man, neither
life, nor substantial comfort can be fetcht.</p>
               <p>Wherefore let vs diligentile note the order.
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:19032:82"/>
For first knowledge goeth-before. For, as it is
rightlie saide, <hi>That which is vnknowne is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desired.</hi>
Secondarilie, of knowledge ariseth à
lust not of the flesh, but of the spirite, or fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
faith. Thirdlie, this lust by due meanes is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
to attaine, to possesse, keepe, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioie
the end.</p>
               <p>Here let euerie one examine his owne hart,
as by à most infallible rule, and leuel, whether
he burne with such à desire, as here is descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed,
or no; and if he perceaue that he doeth
not burne with this holy desire of the Church
which is the chiefest happines, then some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
light is wanting, that is, he doeth not
rightlie vnderstand how amiable this fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of the sainctes is in God, and among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
selues. Therefore let him seeke light, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal
his minde maie be inlightened, &amp; the
desire of his heart stirred-vp, and the darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of ignorance, and malice, expelled-awaie.
But if he perceaue this burning desire, then let
him thinke how he is moued with the holie
Ghost; and let him inflame this desire within
himselfe by meditating of the worde, and by
earnest praier, that he alone maie be desired,
who alone can fulfil the desire, that so al the
grace, which we haue receaued, maie be sent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back
vnto the spring of the right fountaine.
For man naturalie doth desire, both to attaine
the good thing which he longeth for, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:19032:82"/>
attained to retaine and keepe the same.</p>
               <p>But the true, and sound felicitie of man is
God himselfe. Therefore man desireth God:
who because he is infinite, the desire of him
also is infinite, and cannot be satisfied but with
him onlie: and hauing him it staieth and ceas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth.
This desire, although it should be in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
man: yet in them onlie it is pure, and holie,
whose heartes are inlightened, and whose af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
are purged by the light of God. To
this holie desire, and longing both à certaine
care of the spirite, that we maie attaine the
thing which we couet-after; and à feare, wari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
and courage of mind against troubles that
would hurt, is annexed.</p>
               <p>But what meaneth he in saying, <hi>He longeth,
yea and fainteth?</hi> This fainting is not of one that
is wearied, but one that contendeth; nor of
one tired, but of one that burneth. For this
holie desire ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> neuer be so satisfied in this life,
but it wil thirst yet more after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> liuing foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.<note place="margin">Isai. 12, 2.</note>
For continualie this wil be the voice of
the Church. <hi>Beholde God is my saluation, I wil
trust,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">3.</note> 
                  <hi>and wil not feare, for the Lorde God is my
strength and song; He also is become my saluation.
Therefore with ioie shal ye draw waters out of the
wels of saluation.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">4.</note> 
                  <hi>And ye shal saie in that daie,
Praise the Lorde; and cal-vpon his name.</hi> And
therefore the Psalmist addeth:</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="138" facs="tcp:19032:83"/>
MINE HEART AND MY FLESH HAVE
REIOICED IN THE LIVING GOD.</p>
               <p>WHat?<note place="margin">Hart of man Gen. 8, 21.</note> Is not <hi>the heart of man euil, euen
from his youth?</hi> Is not the flesh defiled?
Surelie the heart of man before regeneration
is peruerse, stonie and harde, that is disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
and wil not giue place to the wordes of
God. The flesh in like sorte before regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
is the store-house of al manner wicked af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
wherebie it ministreth instrumentes
to the committing of al impietie and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
whatsoeuer. How true this is which I saie,
I wil shewe by two places of the Scripture:
the former whereof shal teach vs what in tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
we are without the grace of regeneration;
the latter shal assigne the causes of the same.
What we are, Paul out of the Psalme telleth
vs,<note place="margin">Rom. 3, 10. 11.</note> when he saith: <hi>There is none righteous, no not
one. There is none that vnderstandeth; there is
none that seeketh God. Theie haue al gone-out of
the waie;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">12.</note> 
                  <hi>theie haue bin made altogether vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable:
there is none that doth good.</hi> The reason
whie we are such, is expressed, where the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
vseth these wordes, <hi>I testifie in the Lord,
that ye henceforth walke not as other Gentiles
walke,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ephe. 4, 17.</note> 
                  <hi>in vanitie of their minde, hauing their cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
darkened,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">18.</note> 
                  <hi>and being strangers from the life
of God through the ignorance that is in them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of the hardnes of the heart.</hi> By the hardnes
of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> heart he vnderstandeth an extreme num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mednes,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:19032:83"/>
wherebie men are not touched with
the sense of their wickednes, nor couet after à
better state. But after regeneration when by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
hand of God the heart is reformed, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is, made
newe by God himselfe, and purified through
faith,<note place="margin">Pro. 51, 10.</note> according to that of Dauid, <hi>Create in me
à cleane heart, O God, and renue à right spirite
within me,</hi> then becommeth it fleshie, that is,
tender, and obedient, and hearkeneth to the
lawes of God; then it is the place of newe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
and chiefelie of the feare of God, of
gladnes, and reioicing. And therefore in à cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
Psalme it is said,<note place="margin">Psal. 2, 11.</note> 
                  <hi>Serue the Lorde in feare,
and reioice in trembling.</hi> This feare is a childish
feare, holie, and pure: and the reioicing is of
the spirite. When after this maner the heart is
enlarged, and reioiceth, this enlargement, and
reioicing is shed ouer the whole bodie. For se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the hart is the beginning of life in man, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
which diuers veines like conduct pipes do co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueie
an hot, and feruent spirit ouer the whole
bodie; maruel it is not, being enlarged, as it fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
out in à ioie to imbrace the obiect, if the
more subtil vital spirites are spread ouer the
whole bodie, whereof tokens of gladnes doe
appeare in the bodie. For, as the hearte
wrong together, and the vital spirite kept-in,
as when we are sad it commeth to passe, the
rest of the bodie, is vnquiet, whereof procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> saying,<note place="margin">Psal. 6, 3. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>My soule is troubled, al my bones
are greeued:</hi> So the heart being stretched-out,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:19032:84" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and the spirites spread-abroade, the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
is comforted. And therefore Salomon do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
saie,<note place="margin">Pro. 17, 72.</note> 
                  <hi>A ioieful heart causeth good health, but à
sorowful minde drieth the bones.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Furthermore, for so much as the wordes,
Hart, &amp; Flesh are diuerslie taken in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
I wil here set downe the sundrie signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications
which theie haue. For, when words
haue manie significations, that signification is
euermore to be chosen, which agreeth best to
the sense and circumstance of the place.</p>
               <p>The heart therefore in the Scripture is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
after three waies.<note place="margin">Diuers sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifications of the heart</note> First, and properlie it
is taken for one, and the most noble intral in
man, as that which is the beginning and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
of life, and the first that receaueth life, &amp;
dieth last. For in the heart is the vital power, as
saith Augustine, which by drawing-vp, and
giuing aër to coole the heate of the heart, brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
life and welfare to the whole bodie. For
through good aër, it driueth the purified
blood ouer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole bodie by the pulses, caled
arteries. Secondlie it is vnderstode metony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micalie.
For, seeing the heart is the recepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
of the minde, it is taken for the minde it
selfe, and for the properties of the same, as for
reason, wil, knowledge, wit, counsel, wisdome.
Wherefore theie are caled <hi>Homines cordati,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Harted men</note>
that is, harted men, which haue wit, wisdome,
and vnderstanding. Thirdlie it is taken meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoricalie,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:19032:84"/>
both for the middle of some thing;
and also for that which is hid, &amp; secrete. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then you respecte the substance of the
heart; or the minde resting in the same; or the
natural properties which it hath, God is the
author thereof, who vndoubtedlie made no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
which euil was, beeing himselfe moste
perfectlie good. But the wandering motions
in the heart are wicked who proceede not fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
God, but from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> voluntarie reuolting of man
from God. The moste wise God, so created
man, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he had both power to seeke for things
necessarie; and virtue to desire them; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie
to defende his state. Whereof come
those three faculties in man, to wit, the reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,
concupiscible, and irascible, the which
of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues &amp; in respect of their creation are
good,<note place="margin">How the hart of man becommeth froward &amp; wicked.</note> but by an accidental sicknes are become
naught and euil. Whence it is that the heart of
man is oftentimes in the Scriptures saide to be
froward, and wicked. Which thing commeth
to passe after this wise. First, when it is infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
with false &amp; erroneous doctrine; second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
when it is voide of the knowledge of the
truth; thirdlie, when it is troubled with vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane
affections; fourthlie, when it assenteth
to sin, and foloweth the desires of the fleshe, it
becommeth vnpure, and diseased as it were
with moste grieuous sickenesse; or to speake
more brieflie, The heart becommeth peruerse,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:19032:85"/>
&amp; euil, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is either infected with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> plague
of erroneous opinions; or borne-waie by the
stormes of euil affections against reason, and
righteousnes, wherof infinite euils, &amp; diseases
breake-forth. But, when by the hand of God
the heart is reformed, then is it deliuered from
these noisome diseases, and made new, not by
the alteration of the substance, but of the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
or habite of the same, wherebie it becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
pure and good. Which then co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to
passe when y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word of God is harkened-vnto;
and faith fro the worde is conceaued through
the operation of the holie Spirit, which wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
in the word. For by faith the heartes are
purified. Wherof it is that we resist affections
when theie doe arise, and proue better dailie
more and more, so that our onlie desire is, that
God maie like and loue vs. Such an heart Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid
requested of God,<note place="margin">Psal. 51, 10.</note> when he saide, <hi>Create in
me à cleane heart, and renue à right spirite within
me.</hi> Such an heart Ieremiah exacted when he
saith,<note place="margin">Iere. 4, 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Breake vp your fallowe ground, and sowe not
among thornes: be circumcised to the Lord, &amp; take
awaie the fore-skins of your heartes,</hi> that is, be ye
renued,<note place="margin">Ephes. 4, 22. 24.</note> and become a new creature, &amp; casting
awaie y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> old man, put-on the new man, which
after God is created in righteousnes, and true
holines. He therfore termeth the hart fallowe
ground, &amp; the field y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is capable of Gods word
being neither stonie, nor dirtie, nor thornie, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:19032:85"/>
is not hindred with the thoughtes &amp; cares of
this world, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being à meete place for the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial
seede. Such an hart the Prophet Ezekiel
caleth both one,<note place="margin">Ezek. 11, 19</note> &amp; also à fleshie hart, in these
words: <hi>And I wil giue them one hart, &amp; I wil put
à new spirite within their bowels: &amp; I wil take the
stonie hart out of their bodies, &amp; I wil giue them an
hart of flesh.</hi> Here he caleth that one hart, which
cleaueth vnto God alone, &amp; serueth not God
&amp; riches, or idols to, or the cares of this world:
for it halteth not on both sides. As therefore
through the corruption of our nature we haue
à stonie, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is an vngodlie, &amp; hardened hart a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the word of God, which wil not suffer
anie reprehension, no more than the adamant
stone wil yeeld to the striker, &amp; this was figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by Moses tables of stone: So à fleshie
hart is pliant, obedient, and beleeueth, wherin
the word of God is ingrauen, &amp; abideth, so y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
the onlie care which it hath is to obeie the wil
of God. And hereof theie are said to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
heart, who are voide of vnderstanding, &amp;
wisdome, and obedience, &amp; vpon the head do
folowe the desires of the flesh. So that Dauid,
when he saith his <hi>Hart doth reioice in the liuing
God,</hi> vnderstandeth the new hart, created tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
the grace of God in the newe creation.</p>
               <p>Furthermore that our heart deliuered thus
from these pestilent diseases, &amp; renued, maie
not run againe into those infections, it should
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:19032:86"/>
euermore be occupied in these three thinges,<note place="margin">Meditation what;</note>

to be noted that the state of the Church in this

for the building of the whole bodie of the
Church. The which, as it is of Christe: so it
must depend vpon the worde of Christe, and
according to his worde be exercised for the
welfare, and edification of the whole Church.
And therefore saith Paul,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 10, 8.</note> 
                  <hi>Authoritie is giuen

               </p>
               <p>This power is of two sortes,<note place="margin">Ordinarie power of the Church.</note> to wit, either
ordinarie, or iuridical. The ordained power
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:19032:90"/>
is that which hath à certaine rule to worke by;
which the ministers of the Gospel in the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
state of the Church doe folow, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
neither consultation nor the iudgement
of the ecclesiastical senate, but doe gouerne
the Church according to the rule prescribed.
By this power the Preachers doe receiue such
into the Church as are conuerted vnto the
Gospel, and sweare obeiesance to the king &amp;
Monarch Christ, according to this commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement,<note place="margin">Mar. 16, 15. 16.</note>

of Christe,<note place="margin">Matt. 28, 18</note> who in the laste of Matthewe

               </p>
               <p>How do they open and shut?<note place="margin">Howe the kingdome of heauen is opened or shut.</note> By remitting
and by retaining of sinnes. Howe doe they
remit, and retaine sinnes? By preaching repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and remission of sinnes in the name of
Christ. Therefore the ministers of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
as much as in them is, doe open the
kingdome of heauen, and remit sinnes in his
name who sendeth them in message, when
they preach the Gospel. Nowe if the auditors
doe beleeue the Gospel, the kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
is opened vnto them, and their sinnes be
forgiuen, not by the ministers, but of the Lord
himselfe, in whose name the ministers doe
pronounce remission of sinnes. But if the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors
doe refuse to beleeue, the ministers be
saide to shut the kingdome of heauen, and to
retaine sinnes, and that for the euents sake,
not willing lie: for they would ful gladlie haue
al their auditors to beleeue the Gospel, and be
saued.</p>
               <p>This power of Christ committed to the
ministers of the Gospel, is verie aptlie signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by keies. For as keies are deliuered to stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardes
appointed in families, that they maie
serue the Lord, open and shut, not after their
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:19032:91"/>
owne minde, but according to the pleasure of
their master: So to the ministers of the gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
power is giuen to open and to shut the
kingdome of heauen, according to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
and precept of Christ the house<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder.
For they are stewardes, not the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of the house; and seruantes, not Lordes.
And therefore they are to gouerne al thinges
according to the prescription of their Lorde.
For this cause Paul doeth name the ministers
of the Gospel,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 4, 1. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Disposers of the secrets of God:</hi>
in whome this onelie thing is required, <hi>That
they be found faithful.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To conclude, the summe of al is this: The
keies of the Church are the word, and faith.
For as the preaching of the word of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> attaining remission of sins through
Christ is one keie to open, &amp; to shut the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of God, (which keie hath à double vse.
One is, of one nature, which is to open the
kingdome of heauen: the other is, through
the default of the hearers, to shut the kingdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of heauen. And therefore Christ himselfe is to
some the sauor of death vnto death, and to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
the sauor of life vnto life. But, as he is the
sauor of life of his owne nature: so is he the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uor
of death through the wickednes of men
that wil not credite the Gospel. So in that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
deede it is but one keie, but it hath à double
vse.) So whoso beleeueth through the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:19032:92"/>
of the holie spirite he adioineth faith to
the Gospel, which is as it were another keie of
the kingdome of heauen. By these two keies
the kingdome of heauen is shut vp; and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
of sinnes obteined.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, as Christ, Peter, Philip, Iohn
Paul, and the other Apostles, doe applie this
keie sometime to manie together, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
to one by himselfe: So godlie ministers
of the worde both publiquelie, and priuatelie
maie vse this auctoritie of opening and shut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the kingdome of God, that is of binding
and loasing sinnes.<note place="margin">What it is to binde.</note> For as this binding, is an
adiudging of that man who beleeueth not the
Gospel,<note place="margin">What is meant by loasing.</note> but serueth sinne, and Sathan, vnto
death and damnation, vnlesse he repent: So
loasing is à setting of him free, who belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
the gospel, from the woeful bondage of
sinne, and the diuel, and à giuing of the most
desired libertie in Iesus Christ; that being now
set-free from death and perdition he maie
serue God by righteousnes for euermore.</p>
               <p>Hereby appeareth, both the excellencie
of this power; and also howe it is not tied vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
men, as the Pope thinketh, but to the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterie
of the worde; and that ordinarie regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is subiect to this power, as farfoorth as
the Church is guided by doctrine, sacraments,
ceremonies,<note place="margin">Iuridical power of the Church.</note> and discipline.</p>
               <p>The iuridical power, although it depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:19032:92"/>
cheifelie vppon the power of the keis:
yet, because it requireth deliberation and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sultation
in respect of diuerse circumstances
falling out manie times, which cannot be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
in general rules, I distinguish it
from the former power, which I called ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie.
The iuridical power consisteth in three
thinges, to wit, in alowing sound doctrine;
in reiecting false opinions; and in exercising
ecclesiastical discipline.</p>
               <p>That the catholike Church,<note place="margin">1. The church hath power to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe, and to establish true religion</note> and euerie me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the same haue power to know, and to
alowe religion, it is manifest. For both Christ
inuiteth al men vnto himself, that they maie
learne of men; and the Apostle send-foorth
to teach; and God earnestlie requireth the
knowledge of his worde, without which no
saluation can be attained. Therefore wicked
wretches are the Papistes, who keepe-awaie
the laie people, as they are called, from the
reading of good bookes, and forbid the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
scriptures to be imprinted and reade in à
vulgar speech. whereby doubtles they doe
shewe themselues to be the cruel enimies of
mans saluation; whome those wordes of our
Sauiour should terrifie, me thinkes: <hi>Wo be to
you interpreters of the lawe:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luk. 11, 52.</note> 
                  <hi>for ye haue taken-a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waie
the keie of knowledge: yee entred not in your
selues, and them that came-in yee forbad.</hi> This
checke belongeth vnto the Pharisies in al a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:19032:93"/>
who take to themselues the auctoritie of
teaching, but in the meanetime by corrupting
true doctrine, and that of meere malice and
diuelish hatred, they stop-vp the readie waie
vnto Christ.</p>
               <p>An other part of the iurisdiction of the
Church,<note place="margin">2. The Church hath power to for<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bid false do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</note> is à power to improue, and to reiect
false and erroneous doctrine, as the inuention
of diuels. Therefore saith Christ, <hi>Beware of
false Prophetes;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matt. 7, 15.</note> And, <hi>Take heede to your selues of
the leauen of the Pharisies;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke. 12, 1.</note> And Paul saith, <hi>If a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie

                  <note place="margin">Gal. 1, 8. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>let him be accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.</hi>
Neither, as they thinke, doth it make for
the Papistes, that our Lorde saith, <hi>The scribes
and the Pharisies doe sit in Moses seat:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matt. 23, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Al there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
whatsoeuer they bid you obserue, that obserue
and doe;</hi> For in another place our sauiour spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
of the same Pharisies,<note place="margin">Matt. 15, 14<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Let them alone, they
be the blind leaders of the blind.</hi> Of which I wil
conclude two thinges; one is, Howe they
are to be harkened vnto so long as they sit in
Moses seat, that is so long as they bring the
pure doctrine of Moses. The other is, how al
words, whereby we are commanded to obeie
the rulers and teachers of the Church, haue à
condition though vnexpressed, namelie, how
they are to be obeied, if so be they teach those
thinges which the Lorde hath inioined them
to teach, that is, they are to be obeied, if the
Lord speake in their mouthes, and not that
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:19032:93"/>
old serpent that seduced our first parents. And
this also is ment by those words of our sauior:
<hi>he that heareth you</hi> (to wit,<note place="margin">Luk. 10, 16.</note> vttering my words)

from the right waie are brought into the
same. This correction is vsed, either by telling
men of their faultes, or by exhorting: or by
reprouing, or by threatening, or by punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
Al these at one time alwaies maie not be
vsed, but according as he is giuen who hath
gone-astraie. For if by telling the fault, &amp; by
exhortation he amende, other remedies are
not needeful. But here prudent Censors of
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:19032:94"/>
of behauiour, must endeuor in al correction to
shewe à fatherlie minde, not crueltie. For, as
the one encreaseth loue toward the correcters.
so the other engendereth hatred, and contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie.
As Ambrose doth saie, <hi>He that cruelie is

must be tried, that is, it must be seene whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
punishment wil reclaime him into the

the doctrine of the Gospel.</p>
               <p>This punishment is twofold,<note place="margin">Punishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t twofold.</note> to wit, either
excommunication vppon wicked liuers;
or cursing, vpon obstinate heretikes.<note place="margin">Exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</note> But first
let vs speake of excommunication, the which
when it is to be showen, it must be done both
wiselie to edification, and grauelie with much
compassion, the sentence of the superior offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
being first pronounced against the obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
guiltie person. Notwithstanding singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
heede must be taken heere, that you doe
not so plucke vp the tares, that ye destroie the
wheate withal. Which thing maie be auoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
if the endes of excommunication, which
are three,<note place="margin">Ender of ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> be had in minde. The first is, that à
wicked liuer to the great reproch of God, &amp;
his Gospel bee not suffered among Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.
The seconde, that the good also maie
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:19032:95"/>
not be corrupted through the continual fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaritie
of the wicked.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 5, 6.</note> For, <hi>à litle leauen leaue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
the whole lumpe.</hi> The last is, that he which
hath fallen through shame of the worlde,
maie at length repent, and be reconciled to the
Church. These three endes are al for the edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieng,
and vnitie of the Church. And it is dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentlie
to be considered, when excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
doeth edifie, and when it doeth not.
For if it doeth destroie rather than edifie, it
must not be vsed at al. Which made Augustin,
speaking concerning the remedie of excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication,
to saie, <hi>Let this be done, where there
is no daunger of schisme; tares be to be rooted out,
so that the wheate be not plucked-vp withal.</hi>
               </p>

               </p>
               <p>Curssinge is to be exercised onelie vppon

of the fathers, who by this curssing puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
both Arrius, Sabellius, Manes, &amp; others.
And that this heauie punishment of al other

had that it be not exercised rashlie, through
affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s the matter being not throughlie ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined,

               <p>
                  <pb n="164" facs="tcp:19032:96"/>
For, hee casteth not his thunderbolte of

they put tradition, and interpretation of
the scripture.<note place="margin">Traditions.</note> By tradition the Papistes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:19032:96"/>
the lawes which the Popes, Bishops
and Prelates doe thrust-vpon the Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
the worde of God, yea and often contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
also vnto the same. And that they maie
seeme to stablishe, and to builde this their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoritie
vpon the worde of God, they aleadge
both the saieng of Paul, and the example also
of the Apostles. The saieng of Paul is this:
<hi>Keepe the traditions which ye haue beene taught,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. The. 2, 15</note>
                  <hi>either by worde, or by our Epistle.</hi> The example
of the Apostles they bring-out, who comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the Gentiles to <hi>absteine from thinges offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
vnto idols,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 15, 28. 29.</note> 
                  <hi>and bloode, and that that is stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled.</hi>
Hereof y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Papistes do gather two things:
One is, howe they haue auctoritie to make
what traditions they list; another that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
oweth obedience vnto them. But what
answere is to be made maie appeare, both by
the exposition of the word Tradition; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
by the difference of rites and ceremonies.
First therefore let vs shew how this word tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
is vsed.<note place="margin">What the word tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doth signifie.</note> For both y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apostles, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
fathers also tooke it far otherwise, than do
the papistes; &amp; by the comparing of scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
we wil make it euident. Paul in his first
Epistle vnto the Corinthians, writeth after
this wise;<note place="margin">1. Cor. 15, 3.</note> 
                  <hi>First of al I deliuered vnto you that
which I receiued, howe that Christ died for our
sinnes according to the Scriptures:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 11, 23</note> And 1. Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians
11. <hi>For I haue receaued of the Lorde
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:19032:97"/>
that which I also haue deliuered vnto you, to wit,
That the Lorde Iesus in the night that he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traied,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matt. 15, 2.</note>
                  <hi>tooke breade, &amp;c.</hi> Matth. 15. <hi>Whie do thy
disciples transgresse the tradition of the Elders?</hi>
Of these places I do gather how ther be three
sortes of traditions:<note place="margin">Three sorts of traditions</note> the first of doctrine; the
seconde of diuine ceremonies; the last of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
rites.<note place="margin">Tradition of doctrine.</note> Tradition of doctrine is y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which
is deliuered touching the lawe, and the gospel,
and such thinges are conioined with them:
which, forsomuch as they are commaunded
of God maie not be altered.<note place="margin">Tradition of diuine ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies.</note> Tradition of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
ceremonies, is of baptisme, and of the
Lordes supper in the newe Testament; which
likewise dependeth vppon the auctoritie of
Christ,<note place="margin">Tradition of humane rites.</note> and therefore is immutable. Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of humane rites containeth manifolde ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons
both touching ceremonies, and also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
discipline of the clergie &amp; laitie: this
maie be altered for the profite of the Church
at the discretion of gouernors. Irenaeus in his
third booke vseth the word Tradition often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
for the doctrine which the Apostles
from God deliuered to their auditors; and the
same auctor calleth the Apostolical Creede y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
the tradition of the Apostles. Now then see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Church, according to the doctrine of
Paul, hath auctoritie to ordeine such rites as
make for edification,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 10. 8.</note> for so he saith; <hi>Power is
giuen vs for edification;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Co. 14, 40</note> Againe, <hi>Let al thinges
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:19032:97"/>
be done comelie and in order:</hi> godlie magistrates
maie appoint rites for comelines, and order
sake.<note place="margin">Endes of comelines in the Church.</note> The ende of comelines is twofolde; first
by these helpes to stir vs vp vnto godlines, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condlie,
that modestie and grauitie maie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> bee
seene in the handling of Gods matters.<note place="margin">Why order is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued in the Church.</note> Order
hath three endes; one is, that rulers, and prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
of the worde maie haue à certaine rule
to worke by; another, that auditors maie bee
trained vp vnto obedience and discipline; and
the third, that peace and concord maie be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided
for, the Church being set in à good
staie. And herein the people doeth owe obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> magistrats of the Church; yet with
certaine conditions.<note place="margin">How manie things are to be auoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the traditions of men.</note> For in the traditions of
man manie thinges are to be taken heede-of.
First, that they be not contrarie to the rule of
faith; neither that they bring vs from Christ.
As doe manie of the popish rites of inuocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of sainctes; of prophanation of the masse; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
of buieng &amp; selling pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s; of bearing-about
&amp; worshiping bread; of holie water; of rosa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;
of sundrie consecrations; of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> toies of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie;
&amp; such like infinite vanities and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts
of the diuel. In these the godlie are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused
by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement of an hier aucto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,
whereby we are bidden to bewar of ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie.
Secondly, that they be not preferred <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
before Gods heauenlie worde, and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies;
as they were sometime by the Pharisies,
as maie appeare in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Gospel after Mark:<note place="margin">Mark. 7, 9.</note> 
                  <hi>ye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:19032:98"/>
commaundement of God, that yee maie ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue
your owne traditions:</hi> and are at this daie
by the Papistes; as maie appeare by the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments
whereby the transgressors of Gods
commaundement, and of the Popes traditions
are corrected. It would therefore be knowen,
that as the traditions of God through the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
of God doe binde vs vnto per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
obedience: so the traditions of men
must giue place to Christian libertie and that
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> without case of offence. Thirdlie that they be
not deemed necessarie vnto saluation, nor
counted for the seruice of God of themselues,
and <hi>ex opere operato,</hi> as they vse to saie. Last
of al, that vnder the pretence of indifferencie
they destroie not religion. For as the Papistes
are subtil, such thinges as appeare to the eies
goodlie, they doe amplifie; and vnder à sweet
baite the hide deadlie poison. Some Papistes
do exclame how their Masse, is neither com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded,
nor prohibited by the word of God
and therfore is a thing indifferent, and was in
the feare of God ordained by the godlie fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
for the memorie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sacrifice of Christ.
But vnder this goodlie shewe of wordes, as
vnder a faire garment as it were, they conceale
in abominable idole; whereof in due place<note n="*" place="margin">Chap. 24. of this first part.</note>
we purpose to speak. And therfore it is wiselie
to be regarded, when true consideration is had
of comelines and of order.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="169" facs="tcp:19032:98"/>
Interpretation of the Scripture,<note place="margin">Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Scriptures.</note> (which is
another thing theie put-vnder the authoritie
of the Church) being a free gift of God, which
the Lord bestoweth vpon whom he list, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be tied by mans authoritie vnto anie cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
caling of men. For as in olde time God
bestowed not the spirite of prophecie, neither
vpon the ordinarie Bishops onelie,<note place="margin">Al the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uites, nor onelie the Leuites did not prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie.</note> naie fewe
of them were adorned with that excelent gift;
nor to the tribe of Leuie onlie, but at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
made manie of other tribes to be famous
therebie: So the Sonne of God wil not haue
this gift to be tied to ordinarie succession, but
bestoweth it vpon whom he wil. In the tentes
of the Hebrues it is giuen-out how Eldad and
Medad did prophecie in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hoste;<note place="margin">Num. 11, 25 26. 27. 28.</note> which thing
when Ioshua the seruant of Moses could not
brooke, he requested his Lord to forbid them.
But what doth Moses?<note place="margin">29.</note> 
                  <hi>What,</hi> saith he, <hi>Enuiest
thou for my sake? Yea, wold God that al the Lords
people were Prophetes, and that the Lorde would
put his spirite vpon them!</hi> So then the spirite of
prophecie, and exposition of Gods worde, is
the peculiar gift of God. Which he bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
by meanes somtime, and sometime with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
meanes. When it is giuen without meanes
it is counted for à miracle: but when by means,
it is Gods ordinarie gifte, which he both im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parteth
vpon such as earnestlie cal vpon him,
&amp; labor therfore; and encreaseth in those who
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:19032:99"/>
doe vse it rightlie vnto his glorie.</p>
               <p>But three things in this place are to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued.<note place="margin">Touching interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Scriptures three things to be noted.</note>
The first, although God indue manie
with this gift, yet that none presume to teach
in the Church, being not lawfulie caled there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto.
For theie are neuer blessed in their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inges,
which rush-into the office of teaching
without lawful caling; and doe runne before
theie are caled. Which thing, if some factious
fellowes would thinke-vpon, such troubles
would not be in the Church at this daie, as
there be. The seconde, that both the whole
Church, and euerie member of the same, haue
power, as aboue<note n="*" place="margin">in the cha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>piter imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatelie go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before, page. 157. 1. Iohn. 4, 1. What things inter<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>preters doe vtter.</note> also I touched, to proue the
spirites. For so saith the Apostle, <hi>Trie the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites
whether theie are of God.</hi> The third is, how
al the wordes of interpreters be not of equal
weight. For some are probable, some certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
true, and some are meerelie erroneous.
Things probable, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> authoritie sake of the
vtterers, are so long to be imbraced, as theie be
not drawen into à wrong conclusion. Which

theie were.</head>
               <p>FVrthermore, seing the Psalmist in this verse
maketh mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of altars, where God laieth
as yong ones the godlie, &amp; bringeth them vp;
and altars be appointed for sacrifices, I wil
adde here-vnto something concerning sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,
and that especialie for the Papistes, who
by this place would maintaine their idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous
altars for masses, which the godlie doe
knowe is nothing els but a diuelish propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the onelie sacrifice of Christe, who by
his onlie sacrifice once offered, hath made the
saintes perfect for euermore.</p>
               <p>But that the more distinctlie wee maie
speake of sacrifices, I wil entreate first of the
Iewish sacrifices; then of the sacrifices of the
prophane gentiles; after that of the Papistical
idol, that is of the Masse, which theie saie is à
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:19032:102"/>
sacrifice; and last of al of Christian sacrifices.</p>
               <p>The Iewes by the commandement of God
had two altars in the holie citie Ierusalem;<note place="margin">Sacrifices of the Iewes.</note> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was it lawful for them in anie place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
Ierusalem to haue anie altars: the one was
of burnt offeringes,<note place="margin">Altars of the Iewes. where, and what;</note> and was caled the altar of
burnt offering; the other was of incense, and
thereof was caled the altar of incense: both
of them were figures of Christ. For as the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar
of burnt offering did shadowe Christ, as à
purger of sinne: so the altar of incense did fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
Christe, as he was an intreator and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor
for man.<note place="margin">Psal. 141, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>.</note> For incense did signifie praier.
Or as witnesseth Dauid, who in his 141. Psal.
doth saie, <hi>Let my praier be directed in thy sight as
incense; &amp; the lifting-vp of mine hands as an eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
sacrifice.</hi> For when that holie man Dauid
being driuen into banishment could not bè at
the sacrifices which were made at Ierusalem,<note place="margin">Praiers.</note>
in place of incense he dedicateth holie praiers
vnto the Lord; who be therefore signified by
incense, because praiers be of none effect vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
theie be lifted-vp with à godlie affection
of the minde. But omitting altars, speake we
nowe of the sacrifices of the Iewes, &amp; that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this maner. First let vs define what a sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
is; then shewe we the causes; after that wil
wee note the principal kindes; and last of
al, adde some general thinges of the figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
signification of sacrifices.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="178" facs="tcp:19032:103"/>
The definition maie be this.<note place="margin">1. The defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of the Iewes sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices.</note> Sacrifices of
the Iewes were ceremonies of offering giftes,
and burnt offeringes ordeined of God, &amp; that
either to pacifie God being offended, or to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie
their seruice, and religion. Which sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
pleased not of them selues because theie
were done, but in respect of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> faith of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferers,
and thinking vpon the spiritual signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.
And that these rites were instituted of
God,<note place="margin">Iewish sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted of God.</note> both the manifest commandement of
God often repeated not in Exodus onelie, but
also in Leuiticus; and also the testimonies
wherebie God did testifie howe he liked wel
of such seruice, doth proue. And although be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Moses time there was no expresse com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
touching sacrifices: yet that God
accepted them being offered by the godlie,
the examples of good men doe witnesse.
Wherof it maie verie easilie be gathered how
theie were commanded, albeit no mention be
made thereof in the written worde. Againe
Gods acceptation, doth confirme that he was
the auctor of them, not onelie in tolerating
them,<note place="margin">Leuit. 9, 24</note> but also in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manding them to be vsed.
For at foure seueral times the sacrifices of the
saintes with fire from heauen were inflamed,<note place="margin">1. Ki. 18. 38</note>
which surelie was an apparent token of Gods
alowing them.<note place="margin">1. Ch. 21, 26</note> And y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> these sacrifices pleased
not of themselues,<note place="margin">2 Chro. 7, 1.</note> it maie easelie be gathered.<note place="margin">Sacrifices of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues did not pacifie Go<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d.</note>
For what wise man wil think that God wil be
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:19032:103"/>
pacified with the slaughter, bloud, &amp; burning
of beastes set on fire? For the faith therefore
of the offerers, and cogitation of à spiritual
meaning theie liked God: which thing manie
sentences of the Prophetes, doe testifie. Dauid
doth saie,<note place="margin">Psal. 51, 16.</note> 
                  <hi>For thou desirest no sacrifice, though I
would giue it: thou delightest not in burnt offering.</hi>
And againe,<note place="margin">Psa. 50, 7.</note> 
                  <hi>Here O my people, and I wil speake;
heare O Israel, and I wil testifie vnto thee: for I
am God, euen thie God. I wil not reproue thee for
thie sacrifices, or thie burnt offeringes, that haue
not bin continualie before me. I wil take no bullock
out of thine house, nor goates out of thie foldes.</hi> The
prophet Ieremiah doth saie,<note place="margin">Iere. 7, 22.</note> 
                  <hi>I spake not vnto
your fathers, nor co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded them, when I brought
them out of the land of Aegypt, concerning burnt
offeringes and sacrifices.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Isaie. 1, 10.</note> And again, saith Isaiah,
<hi>Heare the worde of the Lorde, O Princes of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Isaie. 1, 11.</note>
                  <hi>hearken vnto the Lawe of our God, O people
of Gomorrah, what haue I to do with the multitude
of your sacrifices, saith the Lorde? I am ful of the
burnt offerings of rams, &amp; of the fat of fed beastes;
&amp; I desire not the bloud of Bullocks, nor of lambes,
nor of goates.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">12.</note> 
                  <hi>When ye come to appeare before me,
who required this of your handes to treade in my
courts?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">13.</note> 
                  <hi>Bring no oblations in vaine: incense is an
abomination vnto me.</hi> These sentences do seeme
not onlie to be contrarie to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement,
which so often is to be found in Leuiticus, but
also to condemne the whole Aaronical priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode
with the altars.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="180" facs="tcp:19032:104"/>
But for the concilement of these contrarie
speeches, we wil aleage three testimonies, and
two examples out of the Scriptures, who
plainlie shal remoue awaie al doubtfulnes, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon
doth saie,<note place="margin">Rom. 15, 8.</note> 
                  <hi>The sacrifice of the wicked is
abhomination to the Lorde.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 50, 16.</note> Dauid saith also, <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the wicked God saide, what hast thou to doe to
declare mine ordinances, that thou shouldest take
my couenant in thie mouth, seeing thou hatest to
be reformed, and hast caste my wordes behinde
thee?</hi> And Isaiah after he reprehended y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
of his people,<note place="margin">Isaie. 1, 16.</note> addeth, <hi>Wash you, make you
cleane. Take-awaie the euil of your workes from
before mine eies; cease to do euil. Learne to do wel;
seeke iudgement; relieue the oppressed; iudge the
fatherlesse, and defende the widowe.</hi> These
places doe plainelie shewe howe the sacrifices
of this people were reproued because of the
vncleanenes of the heart, and il dealing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
man, or because of their froward confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and wicked conuersation. For as the
hypocrites did offer their sacrifices before
God for à recompence: so the wicked thoght
howe by their burnt-offeringes theie were
sanctified, albeit theie were touched with no
feeling of their sinnes. Therefore seeing God
commanded sacrifices to be offered, that theie
might be exercises of godlines, surelie the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferers
ought to bring vnfeigned repentance
and faith, without which no maruel it is if the
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:19032:104"/>
sacrifices were caled abhomination.<note place="margin">Gen. 4, 4. 5.</note> Caine &amp;
Abel did both offer sacrifices; notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
God had respect vnto Habel and to his
offering, that is, vnto his sacrifice: but vnto
Caine and to his offering he had no regarde.
Whie so? Because Habel bought à faith in the
Messiah, whome his sacrifice did shadowe:
wherebie also his obedience in sacrificing did
please. But Caine sacrificed without faith, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming
vpon the dignitie of his worke. And
therefore no maruel though God had no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
vnto his offering.</p>
               <p>The summe of al is this: that sacrifice spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
with faith pleased as fat, and grateful: but
that voide of faith it displeased as drie, &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful.
But Dauid moste plainlie of al shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in his 51. Psal. when the sacrifices of burnt
offeringes do please; for thus he saith: <hi>The sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices
of God are à contrite spirit;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 51, 17.</note>

                  <hi>Then shalt thou accept the sacrifices of

               <p>This I haue spoken the more at large, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause

whome, albeit dust and ashes wil set

content we our-selues with the moste wise
counsel of God, the which let vs oppose not

against the diuel and his members, who dare
to oppose the dotinges of their foolish braine
against the wisedome of God.<note place="margin">Rom. 8, 7.</note> Let vs knowe
that the saieng of Paul is true, who saith, <hi>The
wisdome of the flesh is enimitie against God.</hi> Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
this cause commanding, the godlie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Iewes, did knowe, both how their
sacrifices pleased God, when through faith
theie were done vnto Gods glorie with true
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:19032:105"/>
meditation of the spiritual signification, and
also that theie were bound vnto obedience
vntil Christ came of whome those sacrifices
were figures, and who by his owne and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
sacrifice should set an ende to all figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
sacrifices.</p>
               <p>But, seeing the Iewes at this daie do obiect
to vs howe their sacrifices should not be abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished,
because God is vnchaungeable: I doe
answere, so long as the cause and condition of
the decree is in force,<note place="margin">The second which is the material cause of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices.</note> so long doth God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
abide constant and vnchangeable. The
material cause of Iewishe sacrifices was either
the fruite of earth, or cleane beastes, which
by certain tokens are distinguished in Leuiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus
from the vncleane. It was furthermore en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted
that theie should not vse either leauen
or honie in their sacrifices, but that theie shold
season euerie sacrifice with salt. For God the
law-giuer would haue them to acknowledge
him to be auctor of al, aswel of such things as
doe spring from the earth, as of al liuing crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
beside that are breade; and also craue his
blessing,<note place="margin">The thirde, which is the formal cause of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices.</note> &amp; refer the vse of al thinges vnto his
owne glorie. The formal cause was the verie
manner of sacrifising; which for that it was
diuers, it were much to prosecute the same in
this place; and therefore I remit the reader vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the book of Moses caled Leuiticus.</p>

The endes of the sacrifices instituted,<note place="margin">The last, namelie the final cause of sacrifices.</note> were
foure: whereof the first was, that the people
prone vnto idolatrie might be reclamed ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from
by these exercises. The second, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Gods
people might bee kept in the seruice of one
God, and haue à dailie occasion to exercise
godlines. The thirde, that the people might
haue à type of Christe the sacrifice to come.
The fourth, that by thinking of Christ the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
to come, the Iewes might be warned of
the grieuousnes of sinne, the which forsomuch
as it could not be cleansed by the bloud nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of buls, nor of goates, theie might know
howe to be cleansed throughlie from their
sinne, theie had neede of the bloud of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maculate
lambe, that is of the promised seede,
or Messiah, who alone could tel howe both to
abolish the workes of the diuel, sin, and death,
and also pacifie the offended father. Secondlie
that in this minde theie should flie vnto the
mercie of God proposed in the forenamed
seede, and by faith depend vpon that seede,
glorifieng y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord both in al their mind, heart,
wil, &amp; conuersation, who of his infinite good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
and wise counsel would after such à sorte
redeeme mankind. With such motions did the
fathers, Habel, Noah, Abraham, Isahac, Iaacob,
Moses, Dauid, Salomon, Elias, and manie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
which feared God, sacrifice.</p>
               <p>For these knew right wel how by the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:19032:106"/>
worke onelie, God was not pleased, but
that he respected besid, the faith, and the mind
of the offerers. Notwithstanding some as hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites
&amp; wicked liuers among this people,
did thinke that God regarded the outwarde
worke, and thereby was pacified as by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piatorie
sacrifice. And therefore the Lorde
doeth testifie that their sacrifices were both
abhominable to him, and neuer exacted of
him.</p>
               <p>In the third place the kindes of the olde
sacrifices doe folow,<note place="margin">3. Kindes of Iewish sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices.</note> the principal and cheefe
diuision whereof is this: That one kinde was

to come through the onlie sacrifice of Christ,
al this being lifted vp vpon the altar was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed
with fire. Whereby was signified, that

was done either for supplication, or thankes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing

the which of the principal ende thereof was
tearmed, eucharistical, as that other ilstical,
that is propiciatorie. For as Paul interpretes
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same, it signified purging to come through
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:19032:107"/>
the blood of Christ. For so he saith, <hi>Whom God
hath set-forth to be à reconciliation through faith
in his bloode.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 3. 25.</note> Whatsoeuer other sortes be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
they are contained vnder these.</p>
               <p>Touching the figuratiue signification of
olde sacrifices,<note place="margin">4 Figuratiue significations of Iewish sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices.</note> the Epistle vnto the Hebrewes
teacheth generalie, howe al were figures of
that onelie sacrifice Iesus Christ, which being
offered, al other thinges as figuratiue, ought
to cease. But more particularlie we wil in this
place set-downe some things, especialie those,
which maie leade vs as it were by the hande
vnto à spiritual instructing of our life and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.<note place="margin">The priests office in sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifising.</note>
First therefore commeth-forth the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration
of Priestes, whose dutie was to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
the sacrifice: they had foure thinges to do.
First, they shoulde washe themselues with
water; whereby was signified, howe by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
they themselues being vncleane, were to
be cleansed by spiritual water, which Christ
the chiefe Prieste alone doeth sprincle; an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual
badge whereof Baptisme is. Then, they
were to put-on garments, not their owne but
the priestlie garments, which thing betoke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the innocencie of Christe, wherewithal
being cleansed, and cloathed with his blood,
they doe seeme righteous and bewtiful in the
presence of God. After that they were annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
whereby the spiritual ointment, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:19032:107"/>
they are annointed for Prophetes,
kings, and priestes; and whereby they maie
be effectualie taught concerning the vertue of
Christ his benefites, is signified. Lastlie, they
filled their handes, that is they sacrificed; for
then obedience doeth please God, when it is
shewen of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> who are purged through faith;
cloathed with the righteousnes of Christ; and
vncted with Gods holie spirite. When they
offered burnt offeringes, they were admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
to offer vp the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues spiritualie to God.
Wherevnto Paul in his 12. chapter vnto the
Romanes had regarde.</p>
               <p>When these partes of liuing creatures, as
the kidneie, the liuer, the fat, which partes of
al others are prone vnto concupiscence, were
sacrificed, they were put in minde of killing
wicked lustes and concupiscence, that they
might addict themselues al whole to the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
of God. The parting of the beastes did
giue them to learne, howe they shoulde cut
the worde of God aright, and applie the same
according to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> condition of men. which thing
Paul seemeth to point-at,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 2. 25</note> when he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
to <hi>deuide the worde of trueth aright.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of the double signification of the altar we
haue spoken alreadie. Neither maie we ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe
howe it was decreed that neither leauen
nor honie shoulde be vsed in sacrifices, but
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:19032:108"/>
that they shoulde besprincle euerie sacrifice
with salt. For as we be admonished by leauen
that malice is to be excluded, according to the
teaching of the Apostle; and by honie, that al
hypocrisie must be laid-awaie: So the salte
doeth signifie that al workes ought to be sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned
with spiritual wisdome, faith, and prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;
otherwise they wil not please God. Moe

as depart from God is; and what à great and

of God, which not onelie sheweth to vs the

of seruing God, whereby wee maie bee led
through the kingdome of the grace of Christ

               <p>
                  <hi>In the 31. chapter of Genesis mention is
made of the Gods of the Gentiles,</hi>

hast thou stolne my goods? <hi>Whereof wee
maie gather, that the worde of the promise
being obscured among the posteritie of Noah
foorth-with they inuented strange Gods and
fained worshippinges. For seeing, as Cicero
doth saie,</hi> There is no people, neither so vnciuil,
nor so sauage, but although they be ignoraunt
which is the true God: yet they knowe that some
God is to be worshipped, <hi>hauing lost the true
God, and his worde, they made to themsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues
fained Gods, which thing Paul doeth
pronounce was the punishment of their neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting
the true God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 1, 21.</note> 
                  <hi>when he saith.</hi> Because
that when they knewe God, they glorified him not
as God, neither were thankeful; but became vaine
in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was
ful of darkenes.<note place="margin">22.</note> When they professed themselues
to be wise,<note place="margin">23.</note> they became fooles. For they turned
the glorie of the vncorruptible God to the simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of the image of à corruptible man, &amp; of birds,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:19032:109"/>
and fourefooted beastes, and creeping thinges.
Wherefore also God gaue them vp to their heartes
lustes,<note place="margin">25.</note> vnto vncleanes, to defile their owne bodies
betweene themselues; which turned the trueth
of God vnto à lie, and worshipped and serued the
creature, forsaking the creator, which is blessed
for euer.<note place="margin">Idolatri the iust punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saking God 2. Thes. 2. 11 12.</note> 
                  <hi>So then idolatrie, and the inuention
of fained Gods is the iust punishment of apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasie
from the true God. And this was it
which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same Apostle doth saie:</hi> Therfore God
shal send the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> strong delusio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that they should beleue
lies, that al they might be damned which beleeued
not the truth, but had pleasure in vnrighteousnes.</p>
               <p>Hitherto of the occasion,<note place="margin">Gods of the Gentiles.</note> and cause of ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie
among the Gentiles, nowe ad we some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
concerning the diuers Gods which they
had. The posteritie of Noah, being grosse &amp;
rude, did not worship God the creator, and
gouernor of the worlde, but the things which
to the sight appeared goodlie, and wonderful
in their blockish and most dul iudgementes
they tooke for Gods. This error flowed from
the parentes vnto the children, &amp; daielie more
and more encreasing, through continuance of
time it waxed strong. The ages folowing dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
it impietie to resist the same. For the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steritie
thinke they doe owe that reuerence to
their predecessors, which children do to their
parentes (euen as many at this daie wil not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
from Poperie because of the reuerence y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
they beare to their forefathers.) And therefore
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:19032:109"/>
some because of their goodlie shew &amp; great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
worshipped the heauens, the starres, the
Sunne, Moone, &amp; elementes. Some did num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
brute beastes of whome they reaped anie
commoditie, among the Gods; so did the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians
oxen, cats &amp; serpents. Some ascribed
diuine honor to men, either in respect of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefites,
or for feare, or for flatterie. Some ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
euen the foule diuels, for Gods.
And others esteemed <hi>Palenes, Feare, the Ague,</hi>
and such like for Gods. Al those through the
great, &amp; most miserable calamitie of mankind
were called and counted Gods. But, to speake
onlie of men admitted into the companie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
Gods, that was extreeme madnes of theirs, to
choose them as they did, not for their noble
virtues, but for their notable &amp; egregious vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
as they did epicures, wantons, harlots, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulterers,

Other things co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted at these bankets were
so abhominable, that for shame I cannot vtter
them: wherefore let vs come vnto the sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
themselues.</p>
               <p>Some did sacrifice frankencense to their

                  <note place="margin">Sacrifices of the gentiles.</note> others wine and hearbes: afterward in
processe of time they offered sometime euen
whole flockes of shepe; sometime an hundred
bullocks. Whereof came that name <hi>Ekatombe,</hi>
which Homer vseth. Some did sacrifice euen
whole heards of oxen also. And at the length
through the instigation of sathan that mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer,
who by his oracles seduced the mindes
of men, they came to that passe that they sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed
men. Through which madnesse not one
man alone, nor one countrie onelie, but euen
verie manie nations were driuen to thinke,
that the Gods were pacified by the offering of
mans fleshe. Diogenes, as Theophilus doeth
report, persuaded children to slaie their owne
parentes in sacrifices, and to eat their flesh. It
was à custome among y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Grecians at the yeer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
feastes of <hi>Bacchus</hi> to sacrifice quicke men.
The Lacedemonians did offer to <hi>Mars</hi> the
fleshe of men. The same people, with other
nations, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time of à dearth, or of war did run
vnto the sacrifice of men, as vnto à last refuge.
Wherof it came, that when <hi>Eumoiphus</hi> king of
Thracia had inuaded Grecia with an armie,
the king of Grecia fearing both himselfe and
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:19032:111"/>
his people, sent messengers to know y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> oracle
of <hi>Apollo,</hi> that was of à foule and wicked spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite,
and to craue howe the God offended
might be pacified: to whome the oracle made
aunswere, that by the sacrificing of the kings
daughter, if her owne parents did kil her, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they encountered with the enimie, the
wrath of the God would be pacified. When
<hi>Erechtheus</hi> the king, and <hi>Praxithea</hi> his wife
heard this aunswere, they foorth-with did of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
their murthered daughter vnto the diuel,
and therevpon encountered with the enemie,
and draue him from their kingdome. <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demus</hi>
in like sort killed his onlie daughter for
the welfare of his countrie. It is reported how
that <hi>Aristomenes Misenius</hi> at one sacrifice kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
300. men. The <hi>Herodians</hi> and <hi>Cretensians</hi>
at the feast dais did offer to <hi>Saturne</hi> à dronken
man, &amp; boies vnder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> age of fourteene yeres.
The <hi>Phenices</hi> &amp; <hi>Carthagenians</hi> likewise did sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
to Saturne y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> yong children of Alderme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
set-out in princelie apparel: and for neglecting
this oblation, after they were ouer-come of
<hi>Agathocles,</hi> to pacifie the God offended, at one
time they offered vnto the diuel 200. sonnes
of noble men. The Romanes were of opinion
that <hi>Saturne,</hi> and <hi>Iupiter Latialis</hi> were pleased
with the sacrificing of men, and besprincled
the images of them with mans bloode. The
<hi>Britanes</hi> for à long while did vse to sacrifice
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:19032:111"/>
the blood of captiues in their sutes to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Gods.
The <hi>French-men</hi> when they waged battel did
flee vnto the sacrificing of men. The <hi>Germans</hi>
likewise by à barbarous custome thought it à
great point of Gods seruice to sacrifice mans
bloode to <hi>Mercurie.</hi> So the <hi>Cimbrians</hi> bounde

from one sinne vnto another, vntil blinded

               <p>THe Popedome, or kingdome of Antichrist
haue their priests co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>secrated to offer sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,
not according to the institutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Christ
&amp; exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apostles, but partlie by wicked
imitation of the old people the Iewes, partlie
after the custome of the heathen. For from
both, that is from the Iewes, and heathen peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
they haue borowed such thinges as they
thought would serue best to the setting out of
their toies, and fables. Therefore I wil speake
first of the consecration of Popish Priestes;
then of the papistical sacrifice, or masse; &amp; last
of al, of some other thinges which maie be
thought middle,<note place="margin">A popish Priest who.</note> and indifferent thinges.</p>
               <p>A popish Priest is à person by ointment,
&amp; shauing distinguished from other men, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
both to sacrifice Christ, and also to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
praiers and vowes in the masse for the
quicke and deade, and for other necessities.
That this is the state of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Popish priesthood,
the whole papacie, the canon of the masse, and
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:19032:113"/>
the forme of wordes, whereby the mitred Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
are wont to consecrate their sacrificers,
doe witnesse. <hi>We giue you,</hi> saie they, <hi>power to
offer expiatorie, that is peace offeringes,</hi> Hence is
it that they brag howe they are mediators
betweene God and men; and haue power to
sacrifice for the quicke and deade. Here, if
according to the Prouerb, we wil <hi>cal à boate à
boate, and à spade à spade,</hi> doubtles the Popish
Prieste, somuch as in him is, doeth spoile
Christ of the honor, which the heauenlie fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

                  <hi>The Lorde sware and wil not repent, Thou
art à Priest for euer after the order of Melchi-ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dek.</hi>
And the Epistle to the Hebrewes acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth
Iesus Christ to bee the onelie Prieste
who by his owne sacrifice once offered, hath
for euer made the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> perfect who are to be san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified,
and because of the perfection thereof,
saith he hath no need of successors, as those fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guratiue
Priestes of the olde Iewes had. And
therefore the Popish Priesthood doth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
fal downe by the worde of God, and testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie
of the purer Church, but also is cleane
contrarie to the Priesthoode of Christ. Pope
Gregorie doeth saie: <hi>Woe be to vs if we enter-in
without making à noise, that is, if wee boast that
we are sheepeheardes, and be yet but dumme dogs.
For nothing is lesse tollerable, than for him to be
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:19032:113"/>
deemed à pastor in the Church, who doeth not
speak, and whose voice maketh no noise to edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the people.</hi> By these wordes Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
doth applie the figure of the olde law vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the newe Testament. For, as bels were han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to the Priestes garmente; and Moses doth
plainelie commaunde, that a Priest come-not
abroade without making a sounde: So Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie
wil not haue his Priestes to bee mute,
but to teach. And therein hee meant wel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
notwithstanding he swarued from the truth.
For, as the bels of the legal Priestes, had
God for their auctor: So it shal not bee suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
for Gregories Priestes to haue à wide,
and open mouth to iustruct al, vnlesse that
sound depende vppon the auctoritie of God;
that is, vnlesse they vtter-out pure doctrine,
as Malachie speaketh of the law,<note place="margin">Mal. 2, 7.</note> 
                  <hi>The priestes

which the Lorde by the Prophet Ezechiel
doeth saie,<note place="margin">Ezek. 3, 17.</note> 
                  <hi>Heare the worde at my mouth, and
giue them warning fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me.</hi> For the Lord cannot
abid y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they should take à part from his word,
&amp; à part from the dreames of man; as it were
intermixing corne and chaffe together, but he
wil haue his owne word without mixture
of chaffe to be heard.<note place="margin">Ier. 23, 28.</note> For so he saith, <hi>The
Prophete that hath à dreame, let him tel à
dreame; and hee that hath my worde, let him
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:19032:114"/>
speake my worde faithfulie: what is the chaffe to
wheate, saith the Lorde?</hi> Here doeth God set à
limit or bound for Priestes which they maie
not ouer-passe. As if he shoulde saie: I haue
not appointed Prophetes and priestes to the
ende they shoulde bring this or that indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentlie,
and thrust the same vpon the Church
at their pleasure, but that they defend y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pure
worde and seruice of God, which the worde
prescribeth. For as he compareth the pure
worde of God vnto wheate: So whatsoeuer
men out of their owne braine doe inuent, he
likeneth it vnto chaffe. If then this lawe of
God, and this limitation of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> power of priests
doeth binde al, as indeede it bindeth, let the
Pope shew vs anie word out of the writinges
either of the Prophetes or Apostles of the
vncting of their Priestes, of their shauing, of
their power to offer Christ for the quicke &amp;
deade; and of their application of the merites
of sainctes. If the Pope cannot doe this by
plaine doctrine without sophistrie, surelie we
are not bounde neither to his lawes, nor to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue
his sacrificers for mediators betweene
God and men.</p>
               <p>But they haue à common refuge.<note place="margin">Against good intents beside the worde of God.</note> For they

gouernors of a good inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t; &amp; haue ben

confirmed too. As though good intentes had
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:19032:114"/>
anie place, where the worde of God doth not
shine. Yea foure manner of waies theie make
themselues guiltie, which of their owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
which theie cal good, doe institute anie
diuine seruice without the warrant of Gods
worde. For, first theie are guiltie of apostasie
from God. For theie go from this commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
giuen out by God himselfe,<note place="margin">Ezek. 20, 18<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 19.</note> 
                  <hi>Walke ye not

teaching for doctrines the commandementes of
men.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Marke. 7, 7.</note> Secondlie, theie are guiltie of rashnes. For
what is a more rash parte, than to presume to

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t?
Thirdlie, theie are guiltie of pride,
wherewithal God is highlie displeased, as
though he knewe not wel enough, with what
seruice to be worshipped. Last of al theie be
guiltie of others faultes. For by their example
other superstition dailie doth spring out. For
men are the more emboldened to heape eth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical
superstition together, when theie see o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
doe so before their face. Touching anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie,
I doe saie,<note place="margin">Antiquitie. Against e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>BVt that the matter maie y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> more euidentlie
appeare, let vs see what manner of thing
the sacrifice of Papistes is, that so we maie giue
à more exact iudgement of Priestes. But afore
we define the Popish sacrifice, that is the
Masse, it is behoueful for vs diligentlie to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde
the difference betweene the Masse it
selfe,<note place="margin">Comparison betweene à bodilie har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot, and the spiritual whore the Masse.</note> and the outward colour wherewithal it
is painted. For as an harlot who setteth her
bodie to sale, doth paint her selfe to al lasciui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes,
and vncleanenes; doth set-out her selfe
with rings and iewels; and putteth-on costlie
apparel, therwithal to alure to her selfe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:19032:115"/>
whose substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce she maie wast-awaie:
So that whore of Babylon, caled the Masse,
commeth-abroade set-out as it were with
golde and iewels, while she doth vse certaine
holie lessons, and songes out of the worde of
God, wherebie she doth easelie deceaue the
ruder sorte, and the simple, who deceaued
with the outward shewe, doe thinke her to
be à verie chaste virgine, who in deede is à
moste filthie harlot, hurting her companions
more than the vilest harlot that maie be. For,
as an impudent strumpet doth infect the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
of her louer with contagions and poiso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
diseases: So this Babylonish, or Romane
strumpet infecteth the soule of man with

be vtterlie renounced; and, the filthines of
this harlot being knowen, Christe in time
be made the physician who alone knoweth
the waie to cure and heale the wounds of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.
And therfore we must not stick in the
outward appearance of the Masse, but in our
minde we must haue deeper cogitations, what
one she is in deede when her ornament is
plucked from her. For beeing spoiled of the
same, nothing wil appeare either more odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
or more abhominable, or finalie more
hurteful to mankinde than it is. Nowe
beeing fore-warned by this admonition let
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:19032:116"/>
vs define the Popishe Masse as it is of it selfe
without al colours, and paintings.</p>
               <p>The Masse with the Papistes is both à sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,<note place="margin">The Masse à sacrifice, à sacrament. The Masse how à sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice.</note>
and à sacrament. It is à sacrifice, when
it is offered by à priest occupieng the place of
à mediator betweene God and man for the
saluation of the people, that is for à cleansing
of the sinnes both of the quicke, and of the
dead; and for the obteining of other thinges
from God.</p>
               <p>And it is à sacrament,<note place="margin">The Masse when a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</note> while the feast made
of Bread, of Wine, and of water, is deuoured
onelie of the sacrifising priest. For I speake
not in this place of the Masse wherein some
peeces of bread are distributed among the
people, without participating of the inchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
cup. This definition of the Masse is colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
partlie out of a Canon of the Masse, than
which theie thinke nothing is more holie; &amp;
partlie out of the commentaries of the school<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
whome theie prefer before the writings
both of the prophetes, and Apostles. And the
Masse theie saie, signifieth à transmission: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the people by the priest, who is in the
place of à mediator betweene God and man,
doth transmit, or sende-ouer praiers, vowes,
and oblations. Howe horriblie the Sonne of
God with his priesthood is dishonored here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bie,
no man sufficientlie can conceaue.</p>
               <p>But, because the yonger sorte without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:19032:116"/>
are not able to conceaue the ab ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
in this Popish Masse, I wil first
saie somwhat touching the canon of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Masse;
and then gather reasons wherebie the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanenes,
and abhomination of this Masse
maie apeare. First therefore I demande of the
Papistes, of whome theie haue this custome of
muttering this canon, wherein the mysterie of
the Popish Masse, is contained. If theie saie of
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apostles, theie make Pope Gregorie, whom
theie cal Great, à loude liar. For he saith it was
patcht-together by à cannot tell what school<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.
If theie saie of Christ himselfe, let them
alledge testimonies of the Euangelistes, who
at large doe testifie the actes and saienges of
our Sauiour Christ. Furthermore I aske whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this canon be à parte of the doctrine of
the Church, or no? If it be à parte of doctrine,
whie doe theie deeme it vnlawful distinctlie
to vtter the same, that al the congregation
maie heare it? If it be no parte of heauenlie do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
whie shewe the Papistes more crueltie
against them which reiect the canon, than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
either harlots, incestuous persons, adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers,
or traitors? But the reason is plaine; eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
because theie preferre yea their smalest tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
before the commandementes of God. If
therefore this canon doth come neither from
the Apostles, nor from Christ him selfe; nor
yet is anie part of the doctrine of the church,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:19032:117"/>
doubtles verie wicked are theie which wil
thrust the same vpon the Church of God, as
though there-vpon the whole building of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
did depend. As for me I am fullie per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded
this Canon was brought into the
Church by the diuel himselfe, the auctor of
al idolatrie, and superstition. For the mum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
with their theatrical gestures agreeth to
the incantation, and curssed superstition of
the Gentiles, rather than to the institution of
Christ.</p>
               <p>I wil therefore speake what I thinke of the
Canon.<note place="margin">The auctors iudgement of the canon of the Masse</note> And first I saie, that it is neither ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie,
because it is commanded by no word
of God; nor profitable, because it maketh not
vnto edification; nor yet indifferent, because
it is cleane co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie to the institutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Christ:
but verie wicked; because it spoileth Christe
of the honor of à Mediator. For he alone is
both à cleanser of sinne by his onelie sacrifice;
and the onelie mediator betweene God and
man: which honor the canon ascribeth to à
sacrifising Priest. It is also a polling thing; for
it both was inuented, &amp; is defended of Papists
for lucre sake. It is à poison to soules; for
it slaieth such as repose anie confidence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.
It is not onelie à prophaning, but also an
abolishing of the Lordes Supper. For it
hath no one iote of Christe his institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="207" facs="tcp:19032:117"/>
It is furthermore an inchantment. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause,
through the mumbling of these fiue
wordes, <hi>For this is my bodie;</hi> and breathing of
the priest vpon the bread, it maketh a trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation,
as theie saie, of the elementes.
Yea and it is idolatrous. For these fiue wordes
be no sooner spoken, but both the Priest him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
doth adore the bread, and also offereth it
to be adored of al the people rounde about
him. And so in place of God theie bring-in à
morsel of bread, and that to the greater disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
of God, than did Nabuchad-netzar, that
commanded an image which he had set-vp, to
be adored.</p>
               <p>Thus much briefelie concerning the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
of the Masse. Nowe in order we wil re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
the reasons, shewing what vnholines, and
impietie is in the Masse.</p>
               <p>The first.<note place="margin">1. The first reason whie the Masse is abhomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</note> It is horrible impietie, and sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legious
impudencie to appoint anie seruice in
the Church, without the commandement of
God. For such boldenes is apostasie from
God; whose worde is the light of life, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to that of Dauid:<note place="margin">Ps. 119, 105</note> 
                  <hi>Thie worde is à lanterne
vnto my feete, and à light vnto my path.</hi> And
Salomon out of the worde of his father ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
this Prouerbe:<note place="margin">Rom. 6, 23.</note> 
                  <hi>The commandement is
à lanterne, and the Lawe à light.</hi> So that where
the commandement of God is not, men wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
from the right waie.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="208" facs="tcp:19032:118"/>
Where the Lawe of God is not, there is meere
darkenes. Hitherto in like sorte pertaineth the
first commandement,<note place="margin">Exod. 20, 3</note> 
                  <hi>Thou shalt haue none other
Gods before me.</hi> And therefore it is for God
alone, vpon whome each creature should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend,
to prescribe the forme howe he wil be
worshipped. Dauid then instructed by this
commandement did praie aright, when he
saide,<note place="margin">Psal. 25, 5.</note> 
                  <hi>Lead me forth in thie truth, and teach me:

                  <hi>whatsoeuer is not of faith, is sinne.</hi> For faith

feigne an oblation to be made for the quicke

               </p>
               <p>The second.<note place="margin">2. Reason.</note> It is cursed impietie, and abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable
reproch against the sonne of God to
turne-ouer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> glorie due to Christ alone, vnto
à sacrifising priest. But this is don in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Popish

himselfe, when he braggeth howe he doth of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer

of God by à sacrifising priest, if he arrogate e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
the smalest part of Christe his glorie to
himselfe!<note place="margin">3. Reason.</note> The third. The holie spirit in Paul
doth saie:<note place="margin">1. Tim. 2, 5. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>There is one God, and one Mediator
betweene God and man, which is the man Christe
Iesus, who gaue himselfe a ransome for al men.</hi> In
which saieng of Paul there be two things. The
first, is an assertion wherebie Christe is made
the mediator betweene God and man. The
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:19032:119"/>
second, à reason of the assertion: namelie, for
that Christ alone, and none but he hath giuen
him selfe à ransome for al men. For Paule wil
haue these partes of Christ his priesthood, to
wit sacrifice, and intercession to be so ioined
together, that theie cannot be seuered. As ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Iesus alone is the priest, which by his sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
once offered doth purge wickednes: so
is he alone the mediator, by whome onelie we
haue accesse vnto the Father. For the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
dependeth vpon the merite of the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice.
So that intercession can not be transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
vpon anie beside him, whose duetie it is
to make propitiatorie sacrifice. When there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this dignitie of intercession is ascribed to
à sacrifising priest, great iniurie is done to the
sonne of God. But this do the Papists in their
fained sacrifice. For theie doe not onelie arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
to them-selues the honour of purging
sinnes; but also vsurpe the office of interces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
which is peculiar to Christ. For this is in
their praier in the Masse: <hi>We offer to thie noble
maiestie of thie benefites, and giftes, à pure sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sacrifice,
a holie sacrifice, an immaculate sacrifice,
the holie breade of euerlasting life, and the cup
of perpetual saluation, vpon which do thou vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe
to looke with à fauourable and gratious coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
and to accept them, as thou diddest
vouchsafe to accept the giftes of thie childe Abel
the righteous, and the sacrifice of our Patriarch
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:19032:120"/>
Abraham; and that holie, and immaculate sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
which Melchisedech thie most hie Prieste
offered
to thee. We humblie beseech thee, ô Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie
God, command these to be carried-vp
by the hande of thine holie Angels vnto thine
hie altar, &amp;c.</hi> And again in the same secrete of
the Masse theie ascribe the like honour to
the dead, when the priest craueth that tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
their merites and praiers we maie be
armed with the help of Gods protection. Here
we do see à double impietie to be ioined toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
For theie doe not onelie make à Priest
the intercessor, who standeth-vpon the digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of his sacrifice: but also theie craue that
through the merites and praiers of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
and Martyrs, God would protect them.
And although it folowe <hi>through our Lorde Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christe:</hi> yet moste plainelie theie bewraie
their impietie, in that theie testifie in plaine
wordes howe theie depende both vpon the
dignitie of the sacrifice, and merites of the
Saintes. But when the Papistes doe obiecte
howe Paule adhorteth, that one would praie,
and make intercession for another: I answere,
the saintes do praie, &amp; make intercession each
for others, not with anie confidence vpon
their owne worthines and merites, but vpon
the worthines and merites of the onelie Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator,
our Lord, and sauiour Christ. But the
Papistes in making the saintes Mediators, doe
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:19032:120"/>
vnderstand such patrons as by their own me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites
&amp; worthines maie purchase to vs the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
of God. For this is à common principle
among them, that men liuing in earth do need
patrons in heauen, in as much as theie are
vnworthie to appeare in the sight of God. By
which saieng, beside that theie bereaue Christ
our Mediator of his honor, theie make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
guiltie of threefolde impietie. For first,

which God hath not decreed; and who
consider, that al which dust and ashes doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent

when theie teach howe we must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
vpon the merites of saintes, theie depart
from the true foundation of saluation, and
seeke another foundation to builde their sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation

               <p>For, seeing that mortal man by his owne

<pb n="214" facs="tcp:19032:121"/>
that the merites of Saintes should bring

it is farre from the Supper of Christe to seeke

of the redemption of the Church by
his death, which free redemption of his belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued

wine, &amp; milke the prophet vnderstandeth
the benefites of the Gospel, which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth

are nourished by bread, wine, water, and
milke: so our soules are nourished, and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steined
by the doctrine of the Gospel, by the
holie Ghost, by the sacraments, and other such
free giftes of Christ. Fourthlie, the buieng and
selling of the Popishe Masse doth make mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable

               <p>For by paieng monie for this feigned pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,

purchased theie trust theie be armed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the diuel and death, theie goe-on the
more boldlie in wickednes, and dailie become
the more obstinate. Fiftlie, this gaine of
Masses is the ground of Purgatorie. For to
make their Masses the more vendible, the
Priestes did teach howe there was a Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
of soules after death,<note place="margin">The foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Purgatorie.</note> wherein the soules of

were appointed to be solde to them, who
desired that either them selues, or their

the Patrimonie of Peter, as theie cal it, was
exceedinglie encreased. And hence it is, that
the goodes of miserable men are translated
from the true heires vnto balde Priestes and
Monkes. Sixthe, this gaine of the Masse,
and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> subtiltie of the Romane baude, is the
strength of the Papacie, that is of the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian
kingdome. And therefore maruel
it is not, though the Papistes doe so fiercelie
contend and fight for their altars. For theie
feare much that their chimneies would fal

               <p>
                  <pb n="217" facs="tcp:19032:122"/>
The fifte.<note place="margin">5. Reason.</note> It is abhominable idolatrie to
worship à peece of bread in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> place of Christ.
For, as à litle aboue we haue touched also, the
Priest after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mumbling of the historie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the institution of Christ, doeth firste
of al adore the bread himselfe; and then lifteth
the same vp, that the people maie worshippe
it. For the Papistes be persuaded that by the
virtue of the mumbled wordes of the institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
supper, the elementes of breade and of
wine be transsubstantiated into the verie bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
and bloode of the Lorde; which they lay
open to be adored, but verie erroneouslie. For
this transsumbstantiation so stiflie defended by
Thomas, is contrarie to the nature of a sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
For, as in baptisme it is required that
the substance of water doe remaine, which
while it is sprincled according to Christ his
institution, is à right sacrament, and with
that water after à secret sort the verie bloode
of Christ, whereby the inward man is washed
from wickednes, yea and putteth-on Christ
himselfe, is present: So it is required that in
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> supper of the Lord, the substance of breade
and wine doe remaine, which being reached-forth
and taken after the institution of Christ,
are à verie sacrament, and with that bread &amp;
wine after à secret sorte, the verie bodie and
bloode of the Lorde, whereby the inwarde
man is nourished, fed, and refreshed, are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:19032:123"/>
So that before the vse whervnto they be
ordeined, bread and wine are no more à sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
than is the water of baptisme. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is as great madnes to worshippe the
breade and wine, as if à man woulde worship
the water either to be sprincled vpon à man
to be baptized, or sprincled alreadie, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued
for worship sake. Nowe whereas the
Papistes doe attribute to the reciting of the
wordes of the supper, virtue to transsubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate,
to speake as they do, the elements, sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
they haue learned that of the Magicians,
and witches, rather than of Christ. For he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
it is, and none other, that by his diuine
power worketh in the supper, &amp; by the hands
of his ministers reacheth to vs when wee doe
communicate his verie bodie, and his verie
blod, after an vnsearchable maner. And wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
in reformed Churches the ministers of the
Gospel doe pronounce the historie of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
of the supper with à loude voice in
à knowen tongue, they doe it, not that anie
virtue by that reciting shoulde passe-ouer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the elementes; but otherwise for à most ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
and profitable purpose. For they know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is more comfortable to the godlie, than
to heare the historie of the instituted supper
which containeth the causes of the institutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
and commendeth to them the greate loue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
Christ and his Church. And therefore
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:19032:123"/>
as the Papistes by mumbling with themselues
the wordes of the supper commit hainous sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge,
by keeping close the doctrine of
Gospel, the summe whereof is contained in
the historie of the institution of the supper:
So doe I iudge it an intollerable thing, sorelie
to be punished, if anie woulde celebrate the
Lord his supper without repeating the histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
of the same taken either out of the Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelistes,
or out of Paul. Here some perchance
wil arise, &amp; saie, in the celebration of the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
in the reformed Churches y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bread is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monlie
adored euen as in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> papacie. Herevnto
I doe thus answere: If anie in our Churches
do worship the bread and the cup, he sticketh
as yet in à papistical error, from which he is
to be reuoked by the godlie ministers of the
Gospel. Then I distinguish betwene the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of the bread, and the reuerence towarde
the maiestie of Christ, present in the supper,
which reuerence we do testifie by bowing the
knee, and by outward gestures of the bodie,
while we are occupied in the celebration of
the supper.</p>
               <p>The which reuerence, as I iudge it laweful,
and godlie, and commended to vs by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
Paul: so I doe thinke the worship of
the breade and of the wine, is wicked, &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane,
both because we haue no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:19032:124"/>
to doe, without which à godlie minde can ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
nothing in religion; and also because it
is meere presumption, as that which is not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
with that vse of the sacrament, which the
Lorde requireth.</p>
               <p>The sixt.<note place="margin">6. Reason.</note> It is contrarie to the institution
and nature of the Lorde his supper, that one
seueralie by himselfe shoulde haue à banket
without moe communicants. For thus doeth
Paul saie,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 11. 20 21.</note> 
                  <hi>When ye come together into one place,
this is not to eate the Lordes supper. For euerie
man when they shoulde eate, taketh his owne sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

alone: So neither is it lawful for à priest
to minister the Lordes supper priuatelie to
himselfe alone. If then this Lordes supper be
not à priuate banket, surelie in vaine do those
sacrificers vaunt howe with fiue wordes they
can pluck-downe the bodie of Christ from
heauen vpon their altar. For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bodie &amp; blood
of Christ is onelie in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> place, where the insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
of Christ is maintained, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
according to the institutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. It is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

whereby the kingdome of Antichrist

à waie of death, or damnation, which is of al
such as refuse in this worlde to beleeue on

the soules by masses be redeemed for monie?</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding,<note place="margin">What the Papists do aleadge for them selues to maintain their masse.</note> albeit the trueth touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the idolatrous masse of Papistes, bee not
vnknowen to the Church of God: yet the
Papistes to shew that they haue some ground,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:19032:125"/>
doe obiect three thinges, as buclers for their
defence. For, first they bring-out the deede of
Melchizedech. Secondlie they oppose à place
of Malachie touching the sacrifice to come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Gentiles, with the like. Lastlie, they
doe amplifie the worthines of the people of
the new Testame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. But what force they are of,
let vs brieflie consider.</p>
               <p>The deede of Melchizedech,<note place="margin">Against the first argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Papistes.</note> from whence
the Papistes do seeke to haue their cause coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced,
is thus described Gen. 14. <hi>And Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chi-zedek
king of Shalem brought-foorth breade
and wine,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 14, 18</note> 
                  <hi>and hee was à Priest of the most high
God.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">19.</note> 
                  <hi>Therefore he blessed him, saieng, Blessed art
thou Abraham, of God most high.</hi> Hence do they
most impudentlie inferre that Priestes must
offer to God bread and wine for peace offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringes.
With as good a consequent, might one
make this argument. Philip is in Spaine; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the sea is sweet. For first they doe corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
reade <hi>He offered,</hi> for <hi>He brought-foorth</hi> and
in place of the particle <hi>And</hi> they reade <hi>For.</hi>
Wherby they testifie who is their master, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the diuel, the corrupter and slanderer of gods
worde. Secondlie they doe verie naughtilie
distinguish the thinges which are to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded,
and mingled the thinges that are
to be distinguished. For there be two distinct
members of the narration in Moses. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
is of the king, &amp; his deed: The latter of the
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:19032:125"/>
priest, &amp; his deed. <hi>Melchi-zedek brought-forth
bread &amp; wine;</hi> you haue the king, and his deed.
<hi>And he was à Priest of the most high God, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he blessed him;</hi> Where you haue the priest
and his deed. Melchi-zedek therefore in brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
forth bread and wine, showed himselfe
a liberal king, whereby he would refresh the
wearied host of Abraham: And in blessing A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,
he shewed himself a Priest. For it was
the office of Priestes to blesse the people.<note place="margin">Nom. 6, 22. 23. 24. &amp;c.</note> Nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
6. Thirdlie the Papistes out of the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
vnto the Hebrewes should know, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chi-zedek
was a type not of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> popish Priests,
but of the sonne of God, and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> too after a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
sort. <hi>Thou art,</hi> saith the father vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> son,
<hi>à Priest for euer after the order of Melchi-zedek</hi>
Nowe if they saie how they are Priestes after
the maner of Melchi-zedek,<note place="margin">Heb. 5, 5. 6.</note> they make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
the successors of Christ in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> priesthood
whom the holie spirit in the Epistle vnto the
Hebrewes doeth testifie hath a priesthoode
which shal not passe by succession vnto ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;<note place="margin">Heb. 7, 17.</note>
and who, according to the witnes of the
father, shal haue no successor, but alone shal
abide a Priest for euer. For so it is in the 110.
Psal.<note place="margin">Psa. 110, 4.</note> 
                  <hi>The Lord sware and wil not repent, Thou art
à Priest for euer after the order of Melchi-ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dek.</hi>
Fourthlie it is vndoubtedlie true,
that the holie spirite woulde not haue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termitted
the same, had anie mysterie,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:19032:126"/>
touching the sacrifice of breade and wine in
the newe Testament lien hid in the deede of
Melchi-zedek. For the holie Ghost both ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actlie
and plainelie doeth number the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
wherein Melchi-zedek was likened to
the sonne of God our eternal Priest. By these
reasons it is apparent, howe the Papistes doe
wrest the deed of Melchi-zedek verie il to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablish
their idol. Neither doe we weie their
allegation of some saienges of the fathers, who
haue deliuered to the posteritie y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> error which
they receaued from their elders. For there is
no auctoritie of man so great, but it must giue
place to the worde of God. Neither is a long
and erroneous custome ought else, then the
auncientnes of heresie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Before which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worde
of God deserueth to be preferred. Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret,<note place="margin">Theodore<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> in Cap. 8, ad Heb.</note>
whome alone I preferre before al Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical
writers, waighing the words of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle
vnto the Hebrewes, saith on this wise:
<hi>If therefore both the Priesthoode which is of the
lawe haue taken an ende; and the Priest which is
after the order of Melchi-zedek haue offered
the sacrifice, and brought it to passe that al other
sacrifices shoulde be vnnecessarie, whie doe the
Priestes of the newe Testament vse à mystical ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgie,
or sacrifice? But they who are learned in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
matters doe know, that we doe not offer an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
sacrifice, but cal into minde that one, and
wholesome sacrifice.</hi> Hitherto Theodoret. But
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:19032:126"/>
the age insuing being seduced of sathan tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe
missevnderstanding of the wordes of
the fathers, did frame the idole of the masse.</p>
               <p>The place of Malachie which they bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foorth
to confirme their opinion is this,<note place="margin">Mal. 1, 11.</note> Mal.
1. <hi>In euerie place incense shal be offered vnto my
Name, and à pure offering: for my Name is greate
among the heathen.</hi> Of this saieng of Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie,
and such like, as that is of Ezechiel, <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
à lawful and continual sacrifice to the Lord:</hi>
the Papistes doe endeuour to establish their
missatical sacrifice. But euen children, who
haue but tasted the beginnings of Logike wil
laugh at this conclusion. For who can beare
this conclusion? <hi>Beastes be in the market place:
Ergo, à Chimera is there.</hi> Yea that which is yet
more absurde, of a general vndiuided theie
doe inferre à monster neither heard-of, nor
seene afore of anie man.</p>
               <p>The force of the Prophetes argument is
this. The Prophetes doe fore-tel, how among
the gentils there shalbe à sacrifice, and in al
places à pure oblation. Therefore the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles
conuerted through the preaching of the
Gospel shal haue sacrifices and oblations.
Notwithstanding what kinde of sacrifices, &amp;
oblations they shal be, it must be learned not
of men, but of God, and such as haue the
testimonie of God speaking within the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But
of this we shal speake more afterward<note n="*" place="margin">Chap. 26<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 27. &amp;c.</note> when
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:19032:127"/>
wee shal entreate of the sacrifices of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</p>
               <p>The third thing which the Papistes obiect,<note place="margin">Against the thirde obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Papistes</note>
is the worthines of the people of the newe
Testament. To proue this dignitie the Papistes
bring-out manie testimonies of the scriptures,
especialie two sentences out of the former E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle
of Peter:<note place="margin">1. Pet. 2, 4.</note> 
                  <hi>To whome ye come as vnto à li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
stone, &amp;c. yee as liuelie stones, be made à spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual

                  <note place="margin">5.</note> 
                  <hi>and holie Priesthood, to offer-vp spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
sacrifices acceptable to God by Iesus Christ.</hi>
And by and by in the same chapter,<note place="margin">9.</note> 
                  <hi>But ye are
à chosen generation, à royal Priesthood, an holie
nation, à peculiar people, that ye should shew-forth
the virtues of him that hath called you out of dark<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes
into his meruelous light.</hi> By these and the
like sentences the Papistes doe wel gather the
worthines of the people of the newe Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
but for al that their conclusion, that
therefore they ought to be massing Priestes, to
offer sacrifice for the quick &amp; dead, is naught.
For Peter in this place speaketh not vnto bald
Priestes, but vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole people of God, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
men, women, maides, old-men yong-me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp;
infants, to al which he giueth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> honorable ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
of priestes, as they who are in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> priesthood
to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God
through Iesus Christ. If therfore al Christians
be priestes, to offer acceptable sacrifices to
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:19032:127"/>
God, surelie the priesthoode common to al
Christians is one, and the priesthoode of
papistes is another, the which is committed
onelie to shauelinges to offer acceptable sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices
to God, without the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God, yea contrarie to the manifest
scriptures: Therefore when the Papistes do
reason thus: The excellencie of the people
of the newe testament is farre greater than
of the people of the olde Testament: <hi>Ergo</hi>
It is required that Christians also haue their
sacrifices, and those greater than were in times
passed, otherwise they were of baser condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
than either the prophane people haue
beene or the Iewes vnder the lawe. I graunt
the dignitie is verie ample, I graunt also that
the sacrifices are greater: but that the masse
is the sacrifice of Christians through the
prerogatiue of worthines, it can not bee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.</p>
               <p>Seeing nowe wee haue both shewed by
strong reasons the vanitie and prophanes of
the Popish masse; and declared the lightnes
of the bucklers, which they obiect vnto vs;
it remaineth that wee shunne their impietie
euen as the serpent himselfe, who was the
author to our first parentes that they should
tempt GOD by correcting his commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement.<note place="margin">What it is to tempt God.</note>
For to tempt God is nothing else tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
by dispising his word, ordinance, &amp; vocation,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:19032:128"/>
to seeke another thing through trust of our

which thing the Papistes haue done by inue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
à masse for the quick and deade; whereby
they thinke both to confirme their kingdom,

wicked, so that euerie whit shoulde be

of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Psalmes and lessons taken out of the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred

with à safe conscience, if so be the daunger
of offence maie be shunned; and al suspicion
of plaieng with both handes, auoided. For
I woulde not haue à man so to flie Scylla, that
he fal into Charibdis. For these two extremes
are alike to be auoided, namelie papistical im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pietie,
and al suspicion of Epicurisme. For
he that alwaies doeth auoide the meetinges of
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:19032:128"/>
men, where publike praiers bee made of the
congregation, seemeth not so much to flie pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistical
wickednes, as to folowe them which
are of no religion. And therefore I woulde
haue the godlie abiding among papistes som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
to be at their morning and euening prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
especialie at those wherein neither inuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
is made of the deade; nor their little
God of bread is offered to be adored, as it doth
fal out at the feastes of sainctes, and at hie festi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual
daies, as they cal them, wherein the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fume
of franke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cense is blowen before images.</p>
               <p>Now as touching the baptisme of infants,<note place="margin">Popish Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme.</note>
the godlie are to doe two thinges. Let them
both in heart reprooue the papistical toies,
wherewithal Baptisme after à sort is contami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated;
and with reuerence meditate vpon the
institution of Christ. Which being done, I
am of opinion the godlie are excused, which
either doe suffer their children to be baptised
of Papistes; or otherwise doe come as witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
vnto the baptisme of infants. Because som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
remaineth there yet of the institution of
Christ.</p>
               <p>Here what shal we saie of the masse,<note place="margin">Whether à godlie man maie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with papiste.</note> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
distribution is made both of bread &amp; wine?
Because therein somewhat of Christ his insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
doth remain, shal it be lawful for a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
man instructed aright touching y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> idole of
the masse, to be thereat, &amp; to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate with
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:19032:129"/>
others? For if hee maie be present at the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme
of the Papistes, although it bee foulie
defiled with manifolde additions, because
there is somwhat remaining yet of Christ his
institution; why shal not the same reason be
of strength, in the communion of the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.
This question? although it seeme verie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate,
yet I wil plainelie tel what I thinke
therof: leauing the iudgement to the Church,
that is the true Christians, especialie to such
as haue felt the crosse, and liued among the
pikes. First therefore I distinguish betwen the
masse, and the communion in the papacie. For
I thinke there is as great à difference betwene
the masse, and that solemne communion cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated
among Papistes on Easter daie, as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
heauen and hel. For in the masse there
doth nothing remaine of Christ his institutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
Wherefore as I iudge the masse abhominable,
and therefore to be shunned, as an idole of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan:
so I pronounce that holie which remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
of Christ his institutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For it is wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
to think that so great à thing doth depend
vpon the worthines of ministers. Because in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
the masse, &amp; the communion or supper,
be cleane contrarie actions.<note place="margin">Popishe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>asse one thing, and the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> For the Popishe
masse being ended, the supper of Christe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth.
So that à godlie man abiding among
Papistes, is bound to shun the idole of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> masse:
and maie, so that both offence, &amp; al suspitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:19032:129"/>
halting be taken heed-of, be at the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion,
and with the elect of God, whereof manie out
of doubt doe lurke in the Popedome, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate.
What? Shal it therefore bee laweful to
communicate vnder one kinde, as they cal it?
Are not the laie people excluded fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
cup of the Lordes blood? Manie of our side
supposing that consecration (as they saie) is
done by reciting the wordes of the institution
of the supper, doe iudge it à most hainous of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
if anie do co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate vnder one kinde.
The Popish priestes also do thinke that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> laie
people shal not be partakers of the Lords cup
for the same cause, namelie because y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wordes
be not mu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bled ouer the cup, out of which the
laitie are drunk-vnto. So y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they thinke y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wine
is without y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> presence of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lords blood. Now
if the case did so stand, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is, if so great à matter
did depend vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> repetitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of words rather
tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Christ who in his supper reacheth forth
the sacrament of his bodie &amp; blood, I woulde
not haue à godlie man co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes.
Wherfore hauing these aduersaries, it is
hard to pronounce anie thing without offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce:
yet wil I speake what I doe thinke.</p>
               <p>First of al we must consider,<note place="margin">Consecrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what.</note> that to conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate,
is not, as the Papistes thinke, and halfe-Papistes
doe imagine, by the pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation
of certaine prescribed, or concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
wordes on magique wise to make à
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:19032:130"/>
common and vnholie thing sacred and holie:
but to consecrate indeed is to separate a thing
from à common vse, &amp; to applie it to an holy
vse appointed to God with praise, &amp; thanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing
to his name. That this is a true defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
thereof, he knoweth that either wil com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
the force of the verbe <hi>Cadosh</hi> which with
the Hebrews signifieth to consecrate with the
old custome of consecration: or consider both
the deed of Christ who instituted the supper,
and the doctrin of Paul touching the blessing
of the bread, and cup. Seeing then this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
neither dependeth vppon the virtue of
wordes, nor is hindered by the malice of men
which enuie the godlie the participation of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
cup; but dependeth vppon the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
&amp; institution of Christ, who according
to his promise wil be among the godlie that
cal vpon him; and thinke vpon, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
the benefits of his death, and resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
I doubt not, but the godlie in the pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
doe take part of the bodie and bloode,
albeit the popish incantation do not defile the
cup. For both he that sanctifieth is the sonne
of God; and he that reacheth his bodie and
bloode by the handes of the ministers is the
sonne of God, whose diuine power, and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit
mercy neither is hindred by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> error of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>;
nor broken through y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> malice of enuious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
who suppresse the recitation of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> words
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:19032:130"/>
touching the supper.</p>
               <p>But some maie obiect: Theie which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
together, doe it that theie maie be
one in Christ.<note place="margin">1. Co. 10. 17</note> For so saith Paul: <hi>For we that
are manie, are one bread, and one bodie: because
we are al partakers of one bread.</hi> But the Papists
who bring not faith, are without the bodie of
Christ. For none is in Christ, but through
faith. And therefore it seemeth howe it is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
to communicate with Papistes.<note place="margin">A double communion at the Lords supper.</note> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere
in the supper there is a double commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.
One is of the faithful soule &amp; of Christ,
whereof the same Apostle in that place doth
speake:<note place="margin">1. Co. 10, 16</note> 
                  <hi>The cup of blessing which we blesse, is it
not the communion of the bloud of Christe? The
bread which we breake, is it not the communion of
the bodie of Christ?</hi> Of this communion theie
trulie doe participate, which bring faith with
them vnto the holie supper. The other, which
dependeth vpon the former, is of the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
communicating among themselues.
This communion is not hindred either by the
wickednes of the minister, or though some
one Iudas or other be present. For it is à spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
communion of al the godlie vnder one
head, yea though theie lurke secretlie among
Papistes, as doubtlesse manie doe. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing

               <p>Of this I demande againe, whether ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
did not communicate in the primitiue
Church, before anie ordinarie &amp; publike mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterie
was instituted, and before anie tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
were erected to meete-together? For my
part I am persuaded that the houses of manie
good citizens were temples, wherein godlie
housekeepers with their families did receaue
the Lordes Supper together, and did streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
one another both with doctrine &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.
I therfore distinguish between y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church
wel ordeined, &amp; betwene captiuitie &amp; banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
where the godlie be persecuted. There I
wil haue nothing detracted from the ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
but al things to be done according to the
ordinance of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church wel ordained: but here,
that is in the captiuitie or banishment of the
Church either vnder the Turke or Pope, I do
thinke the godlie are blamelesse, if theie i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitate
the examples of the saintes in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue

the chiefe priest of Christians, let
vs consider what need there was to haue him;
of what condition he was for person; and who
he was.</p>
               <p>The necessitie of the priest maie be deemed
from hence.<note place="margin">The neede that Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans had of à Priests.</note> That al of vs are sinners, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect

knowen: which thing, both the punishment
laide vpon vs by the most righteous God; and
the word of God; and euerie mans conscience
doth witnes. Nowe one of these two must
needs come to passe. For either we were to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
euerlasting lie; or must be reconciled vnto
God. But, because the reconciliation should
be righteous, that the iustice of God might
be satisfied, it could not be done without ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
à sufficient amendes to God for the iniurie he
sustained. Which amendes was necessarilie to
be made by some mediator. That as one A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
did caste vs al by his owne sinne vnto
death, and damnation: so there might be some
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:19032:133"/>
one, who by his own merite should reconcile
vs to God offended, hauing made à reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pence
for the trespasse. Which Mediator betweene
God offended, and men offenders, is caled à
priest. For so it is in the 5. Chapter of the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
vnto the Hebrues:<note place="margin">Heb. 5, 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Euerie hie priest is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from among men, &amp; is ordeined for men, in
thinges pertaining to God, that he maie offer both
gifts; and sacrifices for sinnes.</hi> By this it plainlie
appeareth, howe necessatie à priest was, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile
vs vnto God who was displeased. But
who could giue such à priest, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al mankind
was guiltie; &amp; no man liuing could satisfie no
not for him-selfe, much lesse for others? The
most wise God brought-forth à cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sel, which
man could not giue. For he was as he was mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful,
to take pitie vpon his creature: as he was
wise, to help man least he lost the end where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto
he was created: as he was almightie, not
to suffer the diuel to exercise euerlasting ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie
vpon his owne image: and as he was
righteous, not to let sinne go vnpunished.
Therefore God vttered his most wise coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel
wherebie he declared both his soueraigne
wisedome, and his vncomprehensible mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
and his infinite power, and his most ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
iustice. Wherefore, because the wrath
of God against sinners, as we are al by nature,
<hi>(for we were by nature the children of wrath,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ephes. 2, 3.</note>)
was greater than à meere man could beare; and
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:19032:133"/>
because the iustice of God did require, that
some one among men should be the auctor of
life, as one was of death, God of his goodnes
gaue such a priest, who both could, because he
was God, &amp; ought because he was a man, born
of flesh &amp; blood as al other men, notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
separated from sinners, that is righteous.
Otherwise he had bin vnmeete for such an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.<note place="margin">Gen. 3, 15.</note>
For thus saith God: <hi>The seede of the woman

of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Priest reconciling vs to God by his

y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this our Priest should be both God &amp; man,

For as to the father by his eternal diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie:
so ought he to be conioined to vs by the

societie of humane nature. <hi>The Sonne of God
therefore,</hi> as Ambrose doth saie, <hi>taking our flesh
vpon him became man, that the man Iesus Christ
might be the Mediator betweene God and man.</hi>
It was behoueful therefore that the Mediator
should consist of both natures, that he might
reconcile both. Of the diuine, that he might
talke with God, and appeare before him: of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
humane, that he might both be a debtor, &amp; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
haue to offer vp to God. Whence in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle

                  <note place="margin">17.</note> Againe, <hi>In all thinges it became him

               <p>This definition is collected, both out of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
which we haue spoken of the Priest: and also
from the consent of the whole Scripture, but
especialie out of the epistle vnto the Hebrues.
But euerie part of this definition, as theie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
much store of good doctrine &amp; comfort:
so theie doe require à longer discourse.<note place="margin">Partes of Christe his priesthood.</note> The
partes of the priesthood of Christe expressed
in the definition, be three: namelie, the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the Gospel; Sacrifice; and praier or

For al the virtue of these partes dependeth
vpon the maiestie of Christe, in whome nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
wisedome, nor goodnes, nor puritie, nor

therefore we wil entreate in order.</p>
               <p>The first part is the preaching of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,<note place="margin">The first parte of Christian priesthood.</note>
without which we miserable, and blinde
sinners can hope for no fauour and grace from
God. For without this doctrine of the Gospel
we bee wrapped in miserable darkenes; and
through y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> greatnes,<note place="margin">Benefite of the Gospel.</note> number, &amp; filthines of our

condemned, as so ouer-throwen, that
we must needes dispaire. For, both the lawe
doth threaten the wrath to such as fulfil not

the lawe:<note place="margin">Gal. 3, 10.</note> 
                  <hi>Cursed is euerie man that continueth

which is à testimonie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to come,
doth accuse vs before the iudgement seate of
God; and the miseries of mankinde do witnes
that God is iustlie offended; and the horrible
tyrannie of Satan vpon man, together with
the tragical chances at al times, do proue what
à detestable thing sinne is. I saie nothing of
warres, nothing of the signes in heauen, in

Al these things are but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beginnings as it were
of their miseries, which repent not at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
of the Gospel. Al which our priest
doth heale, if we like mad men with the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,

abolished, neither hath the lawe in vs any

nor death ouer vs anie power at al. This do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the Gospel is called <hi>the mysterie hid

                  <note place="margin">27.</note> Therfore we must shew
in à worde or two what this doctrine of the
Gospel is, that this part of the priesthoode of
Christ maie be the more comfortable vnto vs.
Christ in the 24. of Luke proponeth the su<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me

               <p>Christ the sonne of God himselfe brought
this doctrine out of the bosome of the Father;

offer sacrifice.<note place="margin">Sacrifice of Christ taken diuerslie.</note> Which sacrifice of Christ is
take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> somtime generalie, &amp; somtime specialie.
When it is taken generalie it comprehendeth
al whatsoeuer Christe our Priest hath either
done, or offered to the father for our welfare.
As al his workes are perfect odedience to the
lawe, voluntarie death and passion; and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
intercession with the Father.</p>
               <p>That obedience towarde the lawe is à cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
parte of his sacrifice,<note place="margin">Obedience to the lawe à parte of Christ his sacrifice.</note> it is aparent because
therebie he maketh vs righteous before God.
Of his passion and death the Epistle vnto the
Hebrues doth entreate, when it affirmeth that
Christe offered himselfe for our sinnes, and
by his blood purged our consciences. His in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession
and praiers in the 5. vnto the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brues,<note place="margin">Heb. 9, 14. 6</note>
are called oblations. For thus it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten:
<hi>In the daies of his flesh he did offer-vp
praiers and supplications, with strong crieing and
teares vnto him, that was able to saue him from
death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For these three, to wit, his perfect obedience
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:19032:138"/>
of the lawe; his passion; and his intercession,
mutualie by à certaine order, as effectes of
their causes doe depend each of other, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwise.
For in that he was holie, pure, yea &amp;
moste perfectlie righteous according to the
lawe, his voluntarie obedience in the crosse
was of power to purge al the sinnes of men;
&amp; because he was obedient to the father euen
vnto the death of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> crosse, his praiers doe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile
for the Church euerlasting lie; who ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is the onelie intercessor, because he and
none beside,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 2, 6.</note> 
                  <hi>gaue himselfe a ransome for al men,</hi>
as Paul doth testifie. This consecution or ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
together of Christ his merites doth
notablie appeare in our sanctification. For by
the merite of his death, he doth so purge vs
from sinne,<note place="margin">Merite of Christ his death, and passion.</note> that, if so be we beleeue, we doe
appeare no more guiltie in the sight of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
as Isaiah fore-tolde of him in his 53. Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter:
<hi>Surelie he hath borne our infirmities, &amp; car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
our sorrowes.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Isai, 53, 45.</note> Againe, <hi>He was wounded for

                  <note place="margin">Merite of Christ his obedience to the Lawe.</note> 
                  <hi>he was broken for our iniquities.</hi>
By the merite of his obedience to the lawe he
doth cloth vs, that we maie appeare righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
before God, not through our owne, but
throgh his righteousnes imputed vnto vs. For
so doth Paule saie vnto the Romanes, Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
5. <hi>As by one mans disobedience,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 5, 19.</note> 
                  <hi>manie were
made sinners: so by the obedience of one, shal
manie also be made righteous.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="249" facs="tcp:19032:138"/>
Both which merites, to wit of his passion, and
obedience to the lawe,<note place="margin">Gal. 4, 4. 5.</note> Paul comprehendeth
ththese words: <hi>Christ was made vnder the law,
that he might redeeme them which were vnder
the law.</hi> For whereas there is à double sentence
of the lawe, one of malediction and of death
for not fulfilling the lawe, whereinto we doe
runne through sinne: another of blessing, that
is of righteousnes, and of life, from which
we are fallen by sin, it was needful y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he should
both take vpon himselfe the curse of the law
with the cause, that is our sinnes, being made
accursed; and subiect to death for our sake (For
so saith Paul,<note place="margin">Gal. 3, 13</note> 
                  <hi>Christe hath redeemed vs from
the curse of the lawe, when hee was made à
curse for vs;)</hi> and also restore the blessing of
the lawe to vs, which he hath deserued for vs
by his perfect obedience towarde the lawe,
vnder which he was made not for his owne
sake,<note place="margin">Rom. 10, 4.</note> but for ours. And this doeth Paul meane
where he saith: <hi>Christ is the ende of the lawe for
righteousnes vnto euerie one that beleeueth.</hi> And
because the resurrection of Christ is à most e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident
testimonie of this fulfilling the lawe,<note place="margin">Rom. 4, 25.</note>
Paul affirmeth howe he is <hi>risen againe for our
iustification.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Merite of Christ his in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tercession.</note> By the merite of his praiers and
intercession he hath made an entrance for vs
vnto the father; as Paul saith vnto the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,<note place="margin">Rom. 8, 33. 34.</note>
                  <hi>Who shal laie anie thing vnto the charge
of Gods chosen? &amp;c. It is Christ that maketh inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:19032:139"/>
for vs.</hi> Therefore when Christ is said
to offer his merites to the father, the general
sacrifice of Christ, containing thistriple merit,
namelie of his obedience to the law, of his pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and of his praiers, must be vnderstoode.
Otherwhile y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sacrifice of Christ is morespeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alie
taken for his death &amp; passion;<note place="margin">Sacrifice of Christ as it is specialie vnderstood.</note> which death

righteous, and hier than the heauens: so could
he alone offer à perfect sacrifice for euermore.
Because, in that he was à iust man, hee might
lawfulie take vppon him the cause of vs al; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specialie
seeing one man had brought the rest
of the posteritie into the state of damnation
with himselfe: and in that hee was hier than
the heauens, to wit, verie God, hee was of
power to offer such a sacrifice, as was perfect,
and effectual for euermore: againe, in that he
was one person, al the deedes of his manhood
are most pure, and of an infinite price.</p>
               <p>To whome doeth this priest offer?<note place="margin">2. To whom Christ offred himselfe.</note> Euen
to God himselfe. For to him alone the sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
was due, that his iustice might be satisfied,
whome our first parentes, and we in them of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended;
that the sentence of condemnation for
our transgressing the lawe being vtterlie abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished,
we might be made partakers of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
blessednes through his merit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What doeth this priest offer to God?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">3. What Christ hath offered for vs.</note> 
                  <hi>The
sonne of God the eternal priest hath offered
himselfe to the father vppon the altar of the
crosse, taking our cause, that is our sinne, and
punishment vpon himselfe. For the Epistle
vnto the Hebrewes doeth witnesse, that the
sonne of God was made partaker of our flesh
and bloode, that he might haue that which he
might offer. And Augustine doeth saie,</hi> What
was more meete to bee taken of men, for their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:19032:140"/>
than the fleshe of man? And what so
apt for this sacrifice, as mortal fleshe? And what
so cleane for the sinnes of the worlde, as without
al contagion flesh borne in the wombe, &amp; out of the
wombe of à virgin? And what so gratefulie could
be either offered, or receaued, as the flesh of our sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,<note place="margin">Howe the sacrfices of the olde Lawe were offered.</note>
the made bodie of our Prieste?</p>
               <p>Furthermore, seeing euerie sacrifice in the
olde lawe ought, first to be separated from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things of the same kinde; secondlie to be
applied to the altar, the hande of the Priest
laide there-vpon; thirdlie, to be offered vpon
the altar; fourthlie, being done rightlie accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the lawe, it was à sacrifice accepted of
God: let vs see howe these foure thinges do
aggree to our sacrifice. First therefore Christe
this our sacrifice was segregated from other
men not by nature, whereby he was to be ioi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to them, but by puritie, innocencie, and
excellencie, wherin he surpassed al other men.
Secondlie, he was applied to the altar being
consecrated to God through his wonderful
obedience. For he was offered, euen because
he woulde. Thirdlie hee was offered vppon
the altar, hanged on the woode of the crosse,
bearing vppon his owne heade our cause, that
is both sinne, and the punishment of sinne,
namelie the wrath and curse of God.<note place="margin">Leui. 16, 20. 21.</note> Which
thing was in olde time figured in the goate
vpon whose heade Aaron (hauing confessed
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:19032:141"/>
first his owne sinnes, and the sinnes of the
people of Israel) laide his owne sinnes, and al
the sinnes of the sonnes of Israel, and sent him
awaie,<note place="margin">Aarons goate à fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of Christe.</note> by the hande of a man appointed, into
the wildernes. The truth of this type was ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
accomplished in Christe. For, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
saith, <hi>The Lord hath laide vpon him the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquitie
of vs al.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Isai. 53, 6.</note> So doth Paul applie the figure
to Christe,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 5, 21.</note> when he saith, <hi>He hath made him
to be sinne for vs, which knewe no sinne, that we
should be made the righteousnes of God in him.</hi>
Againe,<note place="margin">Gal. 3, 13.</note> 
                  <hi>Christ hath redeemed vs from the cursse
of the lawe, being made a cursse for vs. For it is
written, Cursed is euerie one that hangeth on tree.</hi>
Furthermore, as that figuratiue goate was sent
into the wildernes to be torne of wilde beasts:
So Christe was deliuered into the handes of
the Scribees, Pharises, &amp; people obeieng the
commandementes of their prince the diuel, to
be slaine for our sinnes, and bare the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
due vnto them, as if it had bene his
owne.<note place="margin">The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene the goates bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring sinnes, and Christe his bearing sinnes.</note> Here we must diligentlie distinguish
betweene the shadowe, and the truth: The
sinnes of the children of Israel were laide v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
the goate, but in a figure onelie: but
Christ indeede bare the sinnes of the whole
world. Neither is here anie trope to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
For herein our whole hope doth consist,
herein the infinite loue of God, doth appeare,
finalie herevpon our whole saluation doth
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:19032:141"/>
depend, that our God trulie &amp; without trope
hath poured forth al his anger vpon his owne
sonne, as though he had bene guiltie of al the
sinnes of the world, who trulie and without
trope was made a cursse, to deliuer vs trulie
and without trope from the cursse. For o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
if the wrath of God had bene fained,
the obedience of the sonne had also bene fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned;
&amp; the hope of glorie also which we loke
for, had bene fained. Therefore Christ is to be
considered with those qualities which he hath
not in him selfe, but through imputation in
respect of his mediatorship which voluntari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
he tooke vpon himselfe, that we likewise
after the same sort, that is through the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of those thinges which were proper to
him, namelie through the satisfaction of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes
and holines, iustified, and sanctified,
might be made his brethren, and heires of one
&amp; the same kingdome. Fourthlie, the sacrifice
Christ so orderlie offered vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> altar of the
crosse, did so both pacifie, and please y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> father,
the force therof shal euermore continue to the
saluation of man.</p>
               <p>The fourth thing which Augustine requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
in euerie sacrifice,<note place="margin">4. For who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Christe was offered.</note> is the circumstance of
persons for whome it is offered. Wherevnto
Paul in these wordes doth aunswere:<note place="margin">1. Tim. 2, 6.</note> 
                  <hi>He gaue
himself à ransome for al men.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iohn 1, 29.</note> And Iohn saith, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde
the lambe of God, which taketh awaie the
sinnes of the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="256" facs="tcp:19032:142"/>
Moreouer beside these foure thinges which
Augustine requireth in our sacrifice, wee haue
added other foure thinges moe out of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle
vnto the Hebrewes in our definition,
namelie the manner of the sacrifice, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
force of the same, the forme of appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eng
it, and the final ende of our knowledge
and confidence in this sacrifice.<note place="margin">Howe Christ was offered.</note> The manner
is, that Christ did offer himselfe through the
eternal spirit. For so saith the Epistle vnto
the Hebrewes:<note place="margin">Heb. 9. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>Howe much more shal the bloode
of Christ, which through the eternal spirit offered
himselfe without spot to God, purge your consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
from dead workes!</hi> By the name of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
spirit he vnderstandeth the power of
the diuinitie ioined with the humanitie, the
which gouerned al this sacrifice, whereof it
commeth to passe, that this bloode, seeing
it was the bloode of that man who also was
verie God, is indued euen with the liuely vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
whereby as he made vs, so he was able al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
to renue vs. In consideration hereof God
is saide to haue died, and to haue purchased
to himselfe à Church by his owne bloode, as
Paul doeth testifie,<note place="margin">Act. 20. 28.</note> when he saith: <hi>Take heede
vnto your selues, and to al the flocke, whereof the
holie Ghost hath made you ouerseers, to feede the
Church of God, which he hath purchased with his
owne bloode.</hi> Hence then is that which wee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

whereof the Epistle vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Hebrewes

referreth the original of all sinne vnto the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel;
the sinne of our first parentes; and vnto
the propagation of the same sinne vnto al po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steritie.
Which thing Paul, Romanes 5. ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preslie

Through both which degrees, the temple of

is infinite, permanent, subiect to no change or

vp of this miserie, to wit, endlesse shame, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual

the Lorde in the 25. chapter of Matthewe,
proponing the iudiciarie sentence, doeth saie,

against man for sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</head>
               <p>OF the greatnesse, and manifoldenesse of
the miserie of mankinde, maie bee ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
after à sort the greatenes of Gods
displeasure againste impenitent persons.
For seeing GOD is righteous,<note place="margin">Rom. 2, 2.</note> and <hi>his iudgee,
ment is according to trueth,</hi> as Paule saith,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:19032:146"/>
it followeth of necessitie that the wrath and
reuengment in God, do answere to his iustice:
that is, that the punishment be not greater tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
was the sinne. But nowe the punishment is
most grieuous, and without ende: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it must of necessitie followe that the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
is infinite, as that whereby the infinite
God is displeased. Wherefore the quantitie
of sinne must not be wayed in false balance,
but must be leuied by true scales. For in sinne
manie things doe concur, for the which God
is iustlie offended: As the contempt of Gods
maiestie; proude contempt against the lawe
of God; à shamefull defiling of Gods image
according to which man was made; imitation
of sathan the enimie of God; treason against
his maiestie; apostasie from the armie of God;
and as it were à conspiracie with the diuel; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable
ingratitude, &amp; foule forgetfulnes of
God his benefites towardes mankinde. For
there was neuer à sinne alone, but alwaies it
draweth à whole chaine of sinnes therewith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.
As wee maie see in the fall of our firste
parentes, and of others which witting and
willinglie doe rushe against the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of God. Of this due waieng of sin many
things do follow. First, that God doth iustlie
in punishing sinne with euerlasting miserie in
them which turne not vnto GOD through
faith in Iesus Christ.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="265" facs="tcp:19032:146"/>
Secondly, that they deride the iustice of God,
and his iust displeasure, who teach men, that
by contrition, confession, and satisfaction, the
forgiuenesse of sinnes, is merited before the
iudgement seate of God. I say nothing of
them, who thinke some sins are of so smal im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance,
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> by a little holie water they may be
washed-away. I omit them in like sort, who
dream that by the Popes pardons, &amp; by Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
sinnes be redeemed, by which toies the
Popes kingdome is encreased, vpholden, and
preserued both to the great dishonor of God,
and the most certaine destruction of infinite
soules. Thirdlie, of the due waying of sinne,
this also followeth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> no pure creature could
satisfie the iustice of God, make amendes
for the offence, and restore man to his former
happinesse, where-from he did fall through
sin. And therfore Christ was faine in the flesh
to take our cause vpon him selfe, and to satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
the iustice of God. And although this
wrath of God, as we haue shewed, be infinite:
yet is it tempered with mercie, as the Prophet
Habakuk doth saie. <hi>In wrath remember mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hab. 3. 2.</note>
And Theodoret, <hi>It is the propertie of God,
by the temperature of mercie to mitigate his iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice.</hi>
But of this mercie we are nowe to

               <p>NExt vnto the mercie of God, we are to
consider the wonderfull obedience of
Christ, which would vouchsafe to take our
cause vpon himselfe; and feele the wrath of
God, to deliuer vs from eternall death. Of
this obedience Paule vnto the Philippians on
this wise:<note place="margin">Phil. 2, 6. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>Who being in the forme of God, thought
it no roberie to be equal with God: but he made
himselfe of no reputation, and tooke on him-selfe
the form of à seruant, &amp; was made like vnto men,
&amp; was found in shape as à man. He humbled him
selfe, &amp; became obedient vnto the death, euen the
death of the crosse.</hi> Here Paul entreateth of the
vnspeakeable obedience of the sonne of God;
and because equals cannot properly be said to
obey one another, but inferiors their betters:
Paule sheweth, howe the sonne beeing of one
essence and power with the Father, did hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
him selfe, taking to himselfe the nature of
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:19032:150"/>
man, wherein he became obedient to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
euen vnto the death of the crosse. And in
the 10. Chapter of the Epistle vnto the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brues
out of the 40. Psalme:<note place="margin">Heb. 10, 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Because it is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible,
that the bloud of Buls, and Goates should
take away sinnes.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">5</note> 
                  <hi>Wherefore when he commeth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the world,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">6.</note> 
                  <hi>he saith, Sacrifice and offering thou
wouldest not: but à bodie thou hast ordeined me.
In burnt offeringes, and sinne offeringes thou hast
had no pleasure.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">7.</note> 
                  <hi>Then I saide, Loe I come (In

I should do thy will, O God.</hi> Isaiah 53. <hi>He was offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
euen because he would.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But with this obedience how agreeth that
prayer thrice repeated in the garden:<note place="margin">How Christ was vnwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to die.</note> 
                  <hi>O my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
if it be possible, let this cup passe fro me; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse
not as I wil,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 26.</note> 
                  <hi>but as thou wilt?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">39.</note> This prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
seemeth to import that the wil of the sonne
differed,<note place="margin">42.</note> yea and was contrarie also to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
wil.<note place="margin">44.</note> For the Fathers wil was that he
should drinke of the cup, which he had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared:
And the sonne desireth that the same
cup, if it were possible, might passeawaie. This
obiection is aunswered by the wordes of our
Lord afterward in the same Chapter vttered:
<hi>The spirit in deed is willing,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">41.</note> 
                  <hi>but the flesh is weake.</hi>
So that what he would not through y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the flesh, the which naturalie, &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
offence dreadeth death; the same he wold
through the willingnesse of the spirite, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bie
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:19032:151"/>
he was obedient to the Father. And thus
doth Cyril also distinguish the same, when he
saith: <hi>That the passion of the Crosse was not vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarie
to Christ, and againe was voluntarie for
the fathers wil, and for our saluation, you maie ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silie
perceiue by this praier, O my Father, if it be
possible, let this cup passe from me. For as the
word of God is God, and naturalie the verie life, no
man wil saie that anie waie he feared death: but
beeing made flesh, he permitteth fleshe, to suffer
that which belongeth to flesh, and therefore as
verie man he dreadeth death standing at the
dores.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here an other question doth arise, what
obtained Christ by his praieng? The Epistle
vnto the Hebrewes maketh answere, <hi>He was
hearde in that which he feared,</hi> for the paines
of death being remoued awaie, he ouercame
those conflictes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The fruite of this wonderful obedience of
the sonne of God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Fruite of Christ his obedience.</note> 
                  <hi>is our iustificatton, and sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.</hi>
As by one mans disobedience, saith Paul,
manie were made sinners:<note place="margin">Rom. 5, 19.</note> so by the obedience of
one, shal manie be made righteous. <hi>The Apostle
highlie extolling this obedience, doth saie,</hi>

               <p>But no tongue can vtter, nor minde conceaue
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:19032:151"/>
howe greate the obedience of the sonne of

is more grieuous vnto me than death it

of Christ it is said:<note place="margin">Psal. 18, 5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>The sorrowes of the graue

<pb n="276" facs="tcp:19032:152"/>
deadlie sorrowes, such as euen kil à man wel-nigh,
and thrust him downe to the graue. Of
this anguish of mind in Christ, I wil cite some
testimonies out of the Gospell.<note place="margin">Mar. 14, 53</note> Marke saith,
<hi>He began to be afraid, and in great heauines.</hi> And
Luke sheweth by an euident signe, how he was
perplexed in minde, when for verie sorrowe
he sweat bloud againe: for thus he saith: <hi>Being
in an agonie,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luk. 23, 44.</note> 
                  <hi>he prayed most earnestlie, and his
sweat was like drops of bloud, trickling downe the
ground.</hi> For it was meete, that as his death was
more bitter then any death, according to bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
sense: so the feare in his mind was most bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of al other paine. And as the infinite
loue made the sense of death nothing the
milder: so did it mitigate nothing of the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternes
of the feare, which was so great, that it
stoode in neede of comfort, euen of the verie
Angels.<note place="margin">Luk. 22, 43.</note> For, as Luke doth say, <hi>there appeared
an Angel vnto him from heauen comforting him.</hi>
For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> diuinitie shewed not it selfe, that Christ
trulie might feele the waight of the burden
laide vpon him, and be in anguish through
the sense of Gods displeasure against our, not
his sinne, which notwithstanding he made his,
by taking our cause vpon himselfe. And Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus
doth saie, <hi>As he was man to be tempted: so
was he the worde, to be glori<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ied. And the worde in
deede rested while he was tempted, crucified, and
put to death; but was assistant to the flesh when he
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:19032:152"/>
ouercame, susteined, rose againe, and ascended into
the heauens.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But, for asmuch as it seemeth vnworthie
the diuine maiestie of Christ, that our Sauiour
should be stroken with such feare, and sorow,
many interpreters here doe seeke refuges, and
faigne tropes and figures, wherebie theie la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor
to soften the narrations of the Euangelists
and the fore-saiengs of Dauid &amp; Isaiah; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
the one saith,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 18, 5.</note> He was compassed about with
the sorrowes of the graue: <hi>and the other,</hi> that he
truely bare our infirmities.<note place="margin">Isai. 53, 4.</note> 
                  <hi>But let the worde of
God be our light. For if wee be ashamed of
Christ his feare, and sorrow, our redemption
shal vade, and come to naught. But Ambose
writing vpon this place of Luke,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luk. 22, 42.</note> Father, if thou
wilt, take-awaie this cup fro me, <hi>sheweth the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
of those interpreters which doe seeke
tropes. For thus he saith:</hi> Here manie doe
sticke, which doe turne the sadnes of our Sauiour
rather vnto an argument of an olde infirmitie from
the beginning, than to à weakenes taken vpon him
for à time, and they desire to wrest the sense of the
natural sentence. But for my part, I doe not onely
thinke him not to be excused, but also no-where doe
more wonder at his goodnes, and maiestie. For vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
he had taken vpon him mine affection, his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite
towardes me had not ben so great. Therfore
for my sake he sorrowed, who had no cause to sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe

<pb n="278" facs="tcp:19032:153"/>
Godhead being sequestred, he is vexed with
the greefe of mine infirmitie. For he tooke my
sorrowe vpon himselfe, that he might bestowe his
owne ioie vpon me; and by our steps hee descended
euen vnto the pangues of death, to cal vs backe by
his footing vnto life. Then I do boldly name sadnes,
because I commend the crosse. Neither tooke he à
shewe of incarnation, but the verie trueth.
Therefore he was to take the griefe, that he might
ouercome, not exclude sadnes. Neither haue thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>OF what an inestimable à price the death
of Christ is, ought diligentlie to be wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
For from hence remedies againste al
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:19032:154"/>
the woundes which sinne doth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> doth afflict vs
with al, are to be fetcht. And therefore saith
Augustine, <hi>Beholde the woundes of him that
hangeth, the bloud of him that dieth, the price of
him that redeemeth. His head hangeth-downe to
kisse; his armes be stretched to imbrace; his bodie
lieth open to redeeme. The greatnes hereof consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
with your selues; these thinges looke you doe
weigh in the balance of your heart, that he maie
wholie be fixed in your heart, who for your sakes
was wholie fastened to the crosse.</hi> Paule vnto the
Romanes compareth Adam and Christ toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.<note place="margin">Rom. 5, 18.</note>
                  <hi>By Adam, he saith, sinne came on all men to
condemnation: but by Christ grace came vpon all
men to the iustification of life. If by the offence of
one,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">17.</note> saith he, <hi>death reigned through one; much
more shal theie which receiue the aboundance of
grace, and of the gifte of righteousnes, raigne in
life through one, euen Iesus Christ.</hi> The cause then
why the obedience &amp; death of Christ, is of so
inestimable à price, is because the man that
suffered, was the only begotten sonne of God,
and verie God too. For of that singular, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable,
and reuerend vnion of the diuine
and humane nature together, whereby God
and man is one Christ, or one person, is the
dignitie, price, estimation, and infinite merite
of all the actions, and passions of Christ. And
therefore rightly doth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church saie: <hi>He is the
verie lambe of God, who hath taken awaie the
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:19032:154"/>
sinnes of the worlde, who by his death hath destroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
death, and repaired life by rising againe.</hi> And
Ambrose: <hi>So great was our sinne, that vnlesse the
sonne of God had died for vs the debters of death,
wee coulde neuer haue beene saued.</hi> Wherefore
when it is said, that the sonne of man hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed
vs through the merite of his passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
à worke of an infinite price and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor
is named, to wit, the worke of the Sonne
of man, who is verie God too: when it is said
howe the death of Christ is à satisfaction, an
infinite price is proposed, euen of that man,
who also is the onelie begotten Sonne of
God.</p>
               <p>And although the God-head neither suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered,<note place="margin">Howe Christ could suffer.</note>
nor died: (for howe can it bee that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
an vnchangeable thing shoulde suffer, or
an immortall thing suffer death!) yet the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
person, which is God, hath suffered,
yet not in the diuine, but in the humane as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed
nature which coulde suffer.<note place="margin">Act. 20, 28.</note> Therefore
Paul doeth saie, <hi>God hath purchased the Church
with his owne blood.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Pet. 4. 1.</note> And Peter affirmeth how
<hi>Christ hath suffered in the fleshe,</hi> that is in the
humane nature, in soule, and bodie. And the
Epistle vnto the Hebrewes doeth saie that
<hi>Christ tooke part of bloode and flesh,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 2, 14.</note> 
                  <hi>that he might
destroye through death him, that had the power of
death, that is the diuel,</hi> signifying plainlie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
howe the diuinitie coulde not suffer, but
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:19032:155"/>
flesh did: and because the diuine nature could
not suffer, he tooke y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which could suffer. And
Theodoret doth saie:<note place="margin">Whie the price of Christe his suffering is infinite and inestima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</note> 
                  <hi>He therfore tooke flesh, that
through it which coulde suffer, that which could
not suffer might sustaine punishment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore in respect of the vnion of the
diuine and humaine nature in one person, the
price and merite of Christ his suffering is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite,
for time, valor and efficacie. For if you
respect the time, it extendeth vnto all ages,
vnto all generations of men: If you marke
the valor, it is able to purge the sinnes of all
mankinde: if the efficacie, the force thereof is
euident, in al, and with-drawen from none
which doe heare the gospel, and by faith re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent.
For the death of Christ doeth abolishe
alike the sinnes of Adam, and of Euah, and of
Peter, and of Paul, and of such as haue bene
since the time of Christ. And this is it which
is saide in the Reuelation, where hee is called,
<hi>The lambe which was slaine from the beginning of
the worlde.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Reuel. 13, 8.</note> As sone therefore as our first pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentes

the power of Christ his death, which was then
appointed to be in the ende of the world, they
were iustified, sanctified, and redeemed from

himselfe in the extreeme miseries, when hee
saide,<note place="margin">I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>I am sure that my redeemer liueth.</hi> And
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:19032:155"/>
of Abram it is written,<note place="margin">Gen. 15, 6.</note> 
                  <hi>Abram beleeued the

And Dauid was persuaded his adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie
and murder coulde be washed awaie by
the merite of Christe his bloode, when hee
saide,<note place="margin">Psal. 51, 7.</note> 
                  <hi>Purge me with Hysop, and I shall be cleane.</hi>
And therefore in an other place he saith, <hi>With
the Lorde is mercie, and with him is great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemption.</hi>
It is great in deede, because it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite,
and can not bee conteined within the
bounds of anie time, or estimation. So that
the vertue of Christ his death extendeth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
all times, and to al ages, and is of sufficient
force to wipe al the sinnes of al mankinde.
Because it is the death not of à simple man,
but of that man who also was the onelie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
Sonne of God, and à verie God too,
deliuered vnto death for our sakes; as Paule
doth saie:<note place="margin">Rom. 8, 32.</note>

howe, alas, vngratefull the maior part of

abide so much as to heare the name of Christ.
For the Iewes blinded with enuie, couetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,

with Mahomets furie like mad men are

auncientnes of error, as it were with a leprosie

                  <hi>but Israel hath not knowen,

By which saying the Lorde both commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
the infinite mercie of God inuiting all
men vnto the knowledge of his sonne, that
by him they maie be saued; and reprooueth
the intollerable blindnes and ingratitude of

an enemie rendring for life and celestial pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion

ingratitude is by so much the greater, as the
benefite is greater that is contemned. So
that it is worthie the euerlasting hatred of all
the chaste Angels, and electe of God. If you

For the first steepe vnto health, as they saie,

               <p>The first cause is that which he calleth the

The seconde cause of this euil ingratitude,<note place="margin">2. causes of mani ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude.</note>
is the lust of the fleshe, that whereby the flesh
or original sinne doth work to bring out most
abhominable fruite. The force of this concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscence
al mortal men doe feele in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues,<note place="margin">Concupis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence.</note>

the which like à pleasant riuer floweth from

which maketh the cogitations, and actions to

               <p>The thirde cause of ingratitude,<note place="margin">3. cause of ingratitude.</note> and of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

               <p>The fourth cause of our ingratitude and
disobedience towarde God,<note place="margin">4. cause of mans vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</note> is <hi>The wil of the

               <p>The fifth cause of mans vnthankefulnesse

custome of the worlde is the fodder of all ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie,
naughtinesse, and peruersitie: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
manie euen of such, as purposed to feare
God, are carried-awaie, so that they become
wilde oftentimes, and spurne against GOD.
Hereof it is that we see in all states such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempte
of the Gospell which reprooueth
this darkenesse: Hereof spring the detesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
behauiour of parentes; the il bringing-vp
of children. For while men doe looke-vppon
the multitude, auctoritie, and power
of such as sinne, they excuse themselues by

not vse Paul his wordes, calling vertue, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honestie;

no paine can bee imagined more grieuous.
When therefore we beholde the most part of
mankinde to rushe headlong as it were into al
manner wickednesse, let vs call into minde
the greatnesse of Gods displeasure, who by
his moste righteous iudgement permitteth,
that mans rebellion bee punished with mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
Of which madnes Paul writeth when
hee saith:<note place="margin">2. Thess. 2, 10. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>Because they receiued not the loue of

For hee insinuateth himselfe to the corrupted

alone hath giuen himselfe à ransome for the

who hath ioined those thinges which were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie
and distant. Hee called Christe à man,
because hee called him an intercessor: for man
was made intercessor. And as hee that woulde
reconcile two, ioining their handes together, doth
put himselfe betweene, and taking one by the
right hande, and the other by the lefte, doeth
ioine them together: So Christe when hee had
vnited the diuine nature to the humane, did
procure such à friendeshippe, as can neither bee
violated nor broken.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 8, 34.</note> And Paule vnto the

is Christe which is deade, yea or rather, which

GOD, and maketh request for vs.</hi> Heere
the Apostle against condemnation setteth the
intercession of Christ sitting at the right hand
of the father, and making intercession for the
Church, and for euerie member thereof. And
vnto the Hebrewes it is thus written of him:

                  <note place="margin">Heb. 7, 24. 25.</note> 
                  <hi>because he endureth euer, hath an euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting

to saue them that come vnto God by him, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

therefore the force of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> obedience of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law in

and pretious. So that it can not bee but his
praier on our behalfe, for whome hee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth

are made his members through faith. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
the difference is herein, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
when hee was in this worlde, hee was

which wil open y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> better this part of christ

               <p>The first is how Christ is to be caled vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
after two waies,<note place="margin">1. Christe is to be praied vnto in two respects,</note> to wit, As the giuer of al good
thinges with the father, and the holy Ghost.
For when we are bidden to praie vnto God, &amp;
Christ is verie god of equal maiestie, &amp; power
both with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> father &amp; the holy ghost, hee is to
be honored euen as God. When it is said ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,<note place="margin">Rom, 4, 10.</note>
                  <hi>Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, &amp; him
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:19032:162"/>
onelie shalt thou feare,</hi> that worship and feare
is commanded, which is of that God, who is
in essence but one, and three in persons. For,
seeing the essence of the diuinitie is but one in
number, and vndiuidible, it must needes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe
that the worship ascribed to God must
apperteine to the persons which are of one, &amp;
the same essence. Againe, because the workes
of the diuinitie vnto things without, as Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine
saith, are vndiuided; it foloweth, that the
seruice of inuocation is vndiuided. This wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of one God, to wit, the Father, the Sonne,
and the holie Ghost, dependeth vpon the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage
of à mediator, without whome there
is no waie open vnto God. Besides, Christe
is to be praied-vnto as à Mediator, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor,
that for his sake, we maie be heard; and
that hee maie intreate the Father for vs; and
that he maie carrie our grones, and praiers vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the eternal Father, according to that saieng,<note place="margin">Heb, 5, 6.</note>
                  <hi>Thou art à Priest for euer after the order of Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisedek.</hi>
Therefore it is wel saide, <hi>O Sonne of
God, make thou intercession for vs with the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Father. I doe begge in thie name, that thou
wouldest begge of the Father, that it maie be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
me.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Euseb. Lib. 10. Eccles. Hist.</note> Eusebius doth saie, <hi>The great Bishop of
the whole Church, euen Iesus Christ, the onelie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
sonne of God, taking all men with a cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
countenance, and lifted-vp handes à sweete

<pb n="298" facs="tcp:19032:163"/>
or bodie, doth offer them to the celestial Father,
and the God of al creatures, he first worshipping, &amp;
yeelding due honor to the Father, after-ward prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eng
him to abide pleased, and gratious alwaie to vs
al.</hi> Furthermore, whereas the saintes doe seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralie
cal-vpon the persons of the trinitie, som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
vpon the Father, somtime vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sonne,
and sometime vpon the holie Ghost, as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancton
in his forme of praiers doth shewe,
theie parte not the vndiuidible vnitie of the
diuine nature, neither exclude theie one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
while theie name another, but theie doe
both acknowledge the vnitie of the Godhead,
because theie knowe that God alone is to be
called-vnto; and confesse à distinction and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualitie
of persons; &amp; do worship the distinct
proprieties of persons in the worke of our sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.
Hereof the primitiue Church, did di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
their praier vnto the three persons of the
Trinitie in this forme of wordes: <hi>Lorde haue
mercie vpon vs; Christ haue mercie vpon vs; Lord
haue mercie vpon vs.</hi> A triple confession there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
of the Church is in this praier. One is of
the vnitie of the God-head, against the Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
and Barbarians, who brought-in à multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of Gods. Another is of the distinction of
persons, and of their equalitie in one diuine
essence, against Arrius and others. The thirde
is, of the distinction of the properties of the
diuine persons in working the mysterie of our
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:19032:163"/>
saluation. For although it be rightlie said that
the workes in his creatures are vndiuided: yet
are not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> properties of persons to be confou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
the Father saueth; the sonne saueth; &amp; the
holie Ghost doth saue. Behold the vndiuided
workes of the Trinitie in sauing vs: yet the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
saueth by giuing his sonne; the sonne sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
by obeieng the father, by suffering, and
by intercession; and the holie Ghost saueth by
regenerating, and sanctifieng. So then the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties
are diuers in the same worke of salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Therfore the distinct inuocations of the
Father, of the sonne, &amp; of the holie Ghost, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monish
vs of these hie matters. And who so at
this daie doe finde fault with these formes, do
hide poison in their minde, and secretlie do ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
inuade the difference &amp; equalitie of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
or confound y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> properties of persons in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
mysterie of our saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.<note place="margin">2. In what respect Christ is an intercessor.</note> Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dlie, in this place
it wold be considred, how Christ is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mediator
&amp; intercessor, either in respect of his humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
onlie; or in respect of his diuinitie onlie; or
in respect of both together.<note place="margin">Magist. Sent. Lib. 3. Distinst. 19.</note> The master of the
sente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, &amp; in our daies too one Stancar an Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,
do saie, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Christ was à mediator in respect
of his humanitie onelie: Osiander on the other
side saith, he was a mediator in respect of his
diuinitie. But here necessarilie, and afore all
thinges this rule must not be forgotten, <hi>That
the names of Christ his office agree neither to the
diuine nature onelie, nor onelie to the humane, but
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:19032:164"/>
to the whole person which is God and man.</hi> For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
Sonne of God did therfore take mans nature
vpon himselfe, that he might be the sauiour of
man according to both natures. Moreouer the
epistle vnto the Hebrues, ascribeth the priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hod
to Christ, according to both natures. And
although he suffered, and died onelie in his
humane nature, and by the power of his diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
ouercame death: yet the benefite of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,
à part whereof intercession is, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
the whole person, otherwise that diuine
nature, had neuer taken mans nature into à
personal vnion. But whereas it is obiected,
None is mediator for himselfe, Againe, None
is intercessor with himselfe: The answere is
easie, These thinges are true in one respect, &amp;
where the person is simple. But here à diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
must be put betwene the Godhead sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
&amp; the Sonne which was sent. The sonne
in that he was sent, is à priest: Therfore both à
mediator, and an intercessor. Therefore the
person sent is the mediatrix with the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head
sending. Hereunto agree the testimonies
of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Fathers. Chrysostome saith, <hi>Neither could
man alone be mediator, because it was for the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator
to talke with God.</hi> Cyril: <hi>And Christ is the
Mediator of God and man: Because in that one
God and man are conioyned.</hi> Ambrose, <hi>That he
might be the mediator of God and man, Christ Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
was God and man; because in God he was man,
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:19032:164"/>
and in man God, that through both he might be à
Mediator.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdlie,<note place="margin">3. When Chrih is an intercessour, for vs.</note> it is to be knowen, that through
the intercession of Christ, we haue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> accesse
vnto the Father, when we abide in grace tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
faith. For in vaine do they pretend the
intercession of Christe; and in vaine doe they
vaunt of the talke with God, who are desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of faith. For it is necessarie, that they be
members of Christ, which wil cal vpon God
aright.<note place="margin">Rom. 5, 10. 2.</note> Therefore saith Paul, <hi>Beeing iustified by

                     </gap>aith, we haue peace towarde God, through our
Lorde Iesus Christ. By whom also we haue accesse
through faith vnto this grace, wherin we stand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthlie,<note place="margin">4. When God doeth accept the praiers of the faithful.</note> it is to be noted, that the praiers
of Saintes, are therfore acceptable in the sight
of God, because they depend vpon the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
of Christ the highe Priest. For when
we make intercession for others, we praie not
trusting in our owne merites, or price which
we haue paide for redemption; but in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite
of Christ his righteousnes, and in the ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
which he hath.<note place="margin">Iohn. 15, 16.</note> Therefore saith Christe,
<hi>Whatsoeuer ye shal aske the Father in my Name,</hi>
that is depending vpon my merite, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession,
<hi>he will giue it you.</hi> Hitherto pertaineth
that compellation in the Lordes praier,<note place="margin">Math. 6, 9.</note> 
                  <hi>O our
Father.</hi> For as the name of a Father putteth vs
in minde of Christ, in whom through faith we
are the sonnes of God, and he is our father: So
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:19032:165"/>
the pronoune <hi>Our</hi> doth admonish vs of faith,
that through confidence in the sonne, wee
should cal vpon the father, not trusting in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
worthines, or merites of our owne. For
which cause the Apostle saith: <hi>Let vs approch
vnto God through him.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 7, 25.</note> 
                  <hi>For he euer liueth, to make
intercession for vs.</hi> As often therefore as wee
would praie, let vs consider the cause whie
we saie Our Father, that we maie both tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughlie
be persuaded, that for his sonnes sake
we please God; and without al doubting also
beleeue, that for the intercession of the sonne,
whose members we be through faith, we are
heard. Wherefore theie which bring not this
faith, do but waste winde when they praie. For
theie haue none accesse vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> father. Let such
then looke what they do, who contrarie to the
word of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> do depend vpon other patrons.</p>
               <p>Fiftlie,<note place="margin">5. We are to make none our mediator saue Christe onelie.</note> forsomuch as the sonne of God is

we maie not flie vnto other patrons, but vnto
Christ alone as the onelie patron, and most

                  <hi>Iesus Christ the iust. And
he is the reconciliation for our sinnes.</hi> But then do

touching the purgation of sinne, and attaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

you respect the expresse worde, there is no
mention of this couenant concerning remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of sinnes, before the Lord entered there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into

I meane both the promise of the restoring

this promise. For the promise in GOD, and
the faith in man, are the substantial partes,

the Epistle vnto the Hebrues doth saie:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 6, 13.</note> When

               <p>Fourthlie,<note place="margin">4. The large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant.</note> we are to weigh, the largenes of

was entered into with Abraham, and his seede

immortalitie to such as are linked to him in

the perpetuitie of the couenant could no way

               <p>Nowe on the other side the faith of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,

And therefore God saith to Abraham,<note place="margin">Gen. 17, 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Walke

And therfore by the virtue of Christ his death
and passion, both Adam, and Habel, and Seth,
and al beleeuers before Christ did come in the
flesh, were salued. The Prophet Ieremiah
speaketh not of this time of the Testament
promised. The time of the couenant exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
was the time when our Sauiour Christ di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and suffered, which time continueth euen
vntill the end of the world, into this time we
are fallen, who beleeue on the Messiah come,
as the Fathers did on the Messiah promised,
although as touching the knowledge of the
Messiah, à more cleare light hath shined vpon
vs than did vpon them. For as the shadowe,
and à goodlie image doe differ: So the cleare
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:19032:171"/>
knowledge which we haue of Christe since he
shewed himselfe, doth much differ fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowe
of the old people. Notwithstanding, to
both peoples it is verie profitable. The time of
the Testament fulfilled, shal be after the resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dead, when euerlastinglie we shal
enioie y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fruit of this wonderful couenant. For
we shal behold, not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> shadow, nor the image,
but the verie thing it selfe, namelie redemptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
and saluation through Christe. The Prophet
Ieremiah then speaketh of this double time, to
wit, of the time when the couenant was exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
in this life, and shal al in al be fulfilled in
the life to come. Nowe let vs see the words of
the Prophet: <hi>I wil put my lawe,</hi> saith he, <hi>in their
inward partes, and write it in their hearts.</hi> What
lawe, I beseech you, is this? What manner of
writing? This word <hi>Lawe,</hi> in the Hebrue tong,
is taken generalie for euerie doctrine. And
therefore an apt signification is to be giuen to
euerie place, according vnto the circumstance
of the place. Zacharias father of Iohn Baptist
therefore doeth helpe vs herein, when he saith
of his sonne,<note place="margin">Luk. 1, 76.</note> 
                  <hi>And thou, babe, shalt be called the
Prophet of the most High: for thou shalt go before
the face of the Lorde,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">77.</note> 
                  <hi>to prepare his waies: To
giue knowledge of saluation vnto his people, by
the remission of their sinnes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">78.</note> 
                  <hi>through the tender
mercie of our GOD.</hi> The Prophete meaneth
out of al doubt the knowledge of saluation,
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:19032:171"/>
and the remission of sinnes through the bloud
of Christe. For so he saith: <hi>Al shal knowe
me.</hi> And that this must be vnderstoode of the
knowledge of Gods heauenlie wil, he plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
doeth shewe, in the wordes immediatelie
ensuing; <hi>For I wil,</hi> saith GOD, <hi>forgiue their
iniquitie, and wil remember their sinnes no more.</hi>
Thus we knowe what lawe the Prophet mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
in this place. But what manner of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
doeth he vnderstand? Surelie this wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
is neither an idle nor an hurtful know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge:
but it is a knowledge with a liuelie faith
in the heart, whereby we be persuaded, and
feele in our mindes that God is merciful to vs,
and hath pardoned our sinns for the merits of
Christ the Priest; and whereby motions of the
spirit agreeable to the lawe of God, be raised-vp
within vs. Of which effect the Apostle cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
it the spirit; and so obedience of the lawe
is wrought in man. This faith, and this liuelie
sense in the hearts of the faithful, is the writing
of the law by the finger of God, that is, by the
holie spirit, at the preaching of the Gospel. For
as the tables of stone did signifie the extreme
hardnes of mans hart, whereof the hart of man
not regenerate, is named stonie.<note place="margin">Eze. 36, 26.</note> So the writing
of the heart doth signifie an heart softened by
the power of the holie spirite, at the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
of the Gospel, that in the same as in a
newe table, the grace of the Gospel, yea and
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:19032:172"/>
the lawe it selfe, which ought to be à perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
rule for the godlie to leade their life by,
maie be engrauen, whereof it is called à fle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shie
heart. And therefore the Lorde by the
Prophet doth saie,<note place="margin">Ezek. 36, 26</note> 
                  <hi>I wil take awaie the stonie
heart out of your bodie, and I wil giue you an heart
of flesh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But here some maie iustlie demaund,<note place="margin">Difference betweene the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament and the Gospel.</note> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
there be anie difference betweene the
newe Testament, and the Gospel. For by that
we haue spoken, it maie seeme that theie be
one and the same thing. Vnto this question
we are thus to aunswere: The newe Testament
and the Gospel, as touching the substance it
selfe, and the subiect, are al one: but in à con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
they differ. For substance, and for
subiect they are one; because both are a prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
of Christ, and howe to attaine eternal
life through Christ. But in à consideration they
differ. Because the one, which is the Gospel,
hath à name from bringing ioiful, and good
newes, touching the attainment of euerlasting
life through Christe: and by the other, that is
the Testament, is signified, that God not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
with à simple promise, doth binde him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
to vs by couenant (an oath comming be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene,)
that we maie vnderstand, both the
immoueable decree of God, touching the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
of saluation by Christ; and howe we
also for our partes are bound to God by faith.
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:19032:172"/>
For faith is one part of the couenant, to wit, of
mans part. For in al couenants, as aboue also
hath bene shewed, mutual conditions, and
lawes be required. The same is to be saide
of the olde Testament, and of Moses lawe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Furthermore, when the Scripture is diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
into the lawe and the Gospel, it is to be
vnderstoode, that the difference is taken
from the things subiect: and when it is diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
into the old and newe Testament, the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
are taken from certaine circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the things subiect. But, when the holie
Scripture, which we cal the old and newe Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament,
is so caled, it is rather of custome than
of any difference of things subiect, except you
speake by the figure Synecdoche. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Augustine doth saie:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Aug. Lib. 2. Retract.</note> Where I saide the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
was included within the 44. bookes of the
olde Testament, following the vsual maner of spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
which the Church hath at this daie, I called
it the old Testament. But the Apostle seemeth not
to cal anie thing the old Testament, but that which
was giuen in mount Sinai. <hi>And therefore y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same
Augustine writing vnto Bonifacius,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Aug. ad Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nif. Lib. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>doth saie,</hi>
howe they might more truly be called instruments
than testaments, that that might be called the old,
and this the new. <hi>I wil add also herevnto à que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
out of Augustine, whose words be these:</hi>
Howe is it named old, which after 430. yeares was
made by Moses; and howe is it called newe, which
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:19032:173"/>
before so manie yeares was made vnto Abraham?
The reuelations are to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sidered in these names,
and not the institutions. The reuealing of the olde
Testament was made by Moses: but the reuealing
of the new was done by Christ, when he manifested
himselfe in the flesh, in whom the iustice of God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared.
Againe, because the old testament pertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
vnto the old man, from which ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of necessitie
is to begin: &amp; the new vnto the new man, of which
man must passeouer fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> oldnes: &amp; therfore in that,
earthly promises are conteined, but in this, heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly.</p>
               <p>Furthermore,<note place="margin">Whether the ten-commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogated, or no;</note> seeing the Apostle saith, the
old testament is abrogated by the newe; and
the olde was giuen in mount Sinai, where the
Ten-commandements were published-out, it
maie in this place be asked touching the Ten-commandements,<note place="margin">Heb. 8, 13.</note>
whether they also be taken-awaie,<note place="margin">Exo. 19, 16. 17. &amp;c.</note>
as part of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> old testament? Vnto which
question I do thus answere: The Ten-co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements,
as they be a part of Moses law, do no
whit bind vs; but as they containe the eternal
pleasure of God, they do &amp; must continue, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
as manie other things in Moses which are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural.
But a double vse, according vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of double man, is to be respected in
the decaloge. For if you respect y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time of man
before the reuelation of Christe in man, that is
before the iustification of man, through y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> faith
of Christ, as man himselfe is called old, who is
bound either perfectlie to obeie the law, or to
be punished according to our Sauiours words
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:19032:173"/>
vnto the proude Lawer:<note place="margin">Mat. 19, 17.</note> 
                  <hi>If thou wilt enter into
life, keepe the commaundements:</hi> So the Ten-commandements
by a certaine analogie, maie
bee comprised vnder the olde testament.
For it is a certaine <hi>Schoolemaster to bring vnto
Christe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 3, 24.</note> as the olde testament, accusing and
condemning man, for that he hath not the
righteousnesse which the lawe requireth,
whereby man is driuen to seeke Christe,<note place="margin">Rom. 10, 4.</note> 
                  <hi>who is
the end of the lawe for righteousnesse vnto euerie
one that beleeueth.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Cor. 3, 13. 14. &amp;c.</note> In this sense Paul opposeth
the moral lawe against the newe Testament.
But if you haue an eie vnto the time of man
after the reuelation of Christe in man, as man
himselfe is become newe: So the Ten-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements
is a rule how a newe man should
leade his conuersation, and shal neuer be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolished.
Whose newe obedience doth please,
because y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> person pleaseth for Christ his sake,
whose perfect obedience to the lawe, is impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the beleeuing man. Now of that which
hath bene saide, let vs make manifest the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
betweene the old and the newe Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
The which although they differ not in
respect of the last end, seeing they both do res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
the reconciliation, &amp; attonement of man
with God, as the final end: yet if we doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
the endes comming betweene, and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances,
the olde Testament doth goe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the manifestation of the new; if the media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
the old by the seruant Moses, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> newe was
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:19032:174"/>
administred by Iesus Christe the Sonne; if the
maner of the dispensation, the Old was but in
à shadowe, the Newe hath the verie image of
things. The shadowe and the figure was the
deliuerance of Israel from the bondage of Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,
Pharao being oppressed; The truth is the
deliuerance of the faithful from the bondage
of sinne, Satan being ouercome. The bringing
of Israel into the land of Canaan, and the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessing
of the same, was the shadowe; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the spiritual Israel into heauen, and the
hereditarie possession thereof, is the truth. The
giuing out of the lawe vpon mount Sinai by
Moses, was the shadow; The truth is the word
which came fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Sion by Christ. The lawe writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in the tables of stone, was the shadow; but
the lawe of God written by the finger of God
in the harts of men, is the truth. The ministerie
of death, was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> shadowe; but the ministerie of
the spirit, and of life, is the truth. To speake in a
word, al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Mosaical things, as his gouernment,
priesthood, purgations, sacrifices, and the rest,
were but shadowes: but Iesus Christ, the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Priest with his benefites, is the truth. Or to
speake both with Augustine, <hi>In the olde Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
there is a hiding of the newe; in the newe a
manifestation of the olde;</hi> Againe, <hi>The olde is the
beginning, the new is the end:</hi> &amp; with Ambrose,
<hi>It is called a testament, because it is dedicated
with bloud, the olde in a figure, to wit, by the bloud
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:19032:174"/>
of à brutish beast; The newe in the trueth, namelie
by the bloud of Iesus Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus much concerning the couenant an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed
to the priesthoode of Christe, and of
comparison, betweene the olde and the newe
Testament; whereof we haue spoken the more
at large, because both olde, and late writers doe
varie in this point: but we hope, we haue made
it manifest according to the trueth of Gods
worde.</p>

               <p>With this faith of the remission of sinnes,<note place="margin">1. Grace.</note>
two thinges are continualie ioined, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
theie differ from the faith of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of sinnes: yet can theie be separated
at no time. And theie are, to speake with the
Apostle, Grace, and Gifte; of which I wil
speake more distinctlie, that we maie the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
consider, what à great blessing faith of the
free remission of sinnes is. Grace in this place
is the verie iustification of à beleeuing man;<note place="margin">Rom. 5, 16. 19.</note>
and from the cause is so caled. For Paul in the
5. Chapter vnto the Romanes doeth saie so,
where he compareth sinne and grace together.
<hi>The iudgement came of one offence vnto condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation:
but the grace of manie offences vnto iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</hi>
And, <hi>As by the offence of one, the fault
came on al men to condemnation: So by the iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eng
of one, the benefite abounded toward al men,
to the iustification of life.</hi> So that with faith of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
remission of sinnes, grace, wherebie we are iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified,
and accepted before God, is ioined: al
which are comprehended in the definition of
iustification.<note place="margin">Iustification what;</note> Which is defined to be, <hi>An ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
of him from sinne that beleeueth in Christ,
an imputation of righteousnes, &amp; à receiuing vnto
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:19032:177"/>
eternal life, freelie for Christ his sake.</hi> When I saie,
for Christ, I include the merites of Christ on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie.
And although the imputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Christ his
righteousnes, be the forme of our iustification
before God: yet because these three benefites
do necessarilie concur together in our iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
I haue included them within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe
of the definition.</p>
               <p>Whosoeuer do either folow the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of workes;<note place="margin">Against the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of workes.</note> or compound righteousnesse of
faith and workes together, theie doe peruert
the word of God. For Paul writing vnto the
Philippians doth on this wise distinguish the
righteousnesse of workes from the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of faith.<note place="margin">Phil. 3, 7.</note> 
                  <hi>The thinges that were vantage
vnto me,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">8. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>the same I counted losse for Christe his
sake. Yea, doubtlesse, I thinke all thinges but losse
for the excellent knowledge sake of Christ Iesus my
Lord, for whome I haue counted al thinges losse, &amp;
doe iudge them to be dongue, that I might winne
Christ, and might be found in him, that is, not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
mine owne righteousnes, which is of the Law,
but that which is through the faith of Christe.</hi>
What I praie could be more plainelie saide?
Paule here compareth two righteousnesses
together: one hee saieth is manns proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
the which hee calleth the righteousnesse
of the lawe, it is in deede the righteousnesse
of man, as farre-forth as man doth endeuour
to fulfil the same, although he can neuer
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:19032:178"/>
perfectlie fulfill the same; and it is also the
righteousnes of the lawe, because it is required
of the lawe: the other he saith is of God, and is
obteined by faith; it is of God, because God of
meere grace imputeth it, and giueth it to man;
and it is also through faith, for that it is obtei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by faith,<note place="margin">Rom. 10, 4.</note> wherbie <hi>Christ is thought to be the
end of the lawe for righteousnes vnto euerie one
that beleeueth.</hi> Which two righteousnesses he
maketh so contrarie, that together theie can
not stand. For he which by the workes of the
law seeketh the righteousnesse, wherbie he
maie stande boldlie in the presence of God,
is voide of the righteousnesse of faith: and
contrariwise who so dependeth vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse
of faith, doth not thinke at al
that hee is iustified by the lawe. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
there is but one righteousnes, which
consisteth in the perfect obedience of the law:
yet in respect of the diuers manner of iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
it is saide to be twofolde. For he that
dischargeth, and by his workes fulfilleth the
lawe, which thing Christ onelie hath done, is
iustified after one sorte: and he, which of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
fulfilleth not the lawe, but beleeueth
on Christe, who hath fulfilled the same,
that the obedience of the lawe done by Christ
maie bee imputed vnto him for righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
that so he maie haue what the lawe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth,
euen the righteousnesse of the lawe,
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:19032:178"/>
yea and with righteousnesse life, is iustified
after another. So that in the manner of obtei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the righteousnes of the lawe, the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
is. For he that doeth the lawe, obteineth
righteousnes one waie; and he that beleeueth,
another. And y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> mortal man can obtaine the
same by doing, but onelie by beleeuing, Paul
sheweth at large, especiallie in his Epistles vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Romanes, Gal. &amp; Ephesians, that maruel
it is howe men can be so frowarde, as to resist
the manifest trueth of God.<note place="margin">Rom. 3, 28.</note> What can bee
saide more plainelie? <hi>Wee conclude, that à man
is iustified by faith without the workes of the law,</hi>
To wit done of our partes? What more eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentlie?<note place="margin">Gal. 2, 21.</note>
                  <hi>If righteousnes bee by the law, then Christ

                  <note place="margin">Ephes. 2, 8. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>but through faith, it is the gift of

what more absolutelie?<note place="margin">Rom. 10, 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Christ is the ende
of the lawe for righteousnesse vnto euerie one that

lawe, that euerie one which beleeueth, is righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
through his obedience.<note place="margin">Rom. 1, 16.</note> Againe, <hi>The

               <p>
                  <pb n="330" facs="tcp:19032:179"/>
They which compounde righteousnesse of
faith and workes together,<note place="margin">Against the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of faith and workes together.</note> as of the partes
thereof, are better liked of the vnlearned, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecialie

wee maie ouerthrowe. <hi>They being igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,</hi>
saith hee, <hi>of the righteousnes of God,</hi> (that
is of the righteousnes of faith,) <hi>and going about
to stablish their owne righteousnes, haue not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
themselues to the righteousnes of God,</hi> that
is, they are not capable of the righteousnes of
faith, who withall seeke righteousnes from
the lawe. <hi>For Christ is the end, that is, the fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
and perfection of the lawe for righteousnes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
euerie one that beleeueth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Faith then alone excludeth all merite, and
al workes of man from the causes of our iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification

Christ alone, who imputeth the obedience of
the law to the beleeuing man, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he maie haue
that which the lawe requireth, to wit, righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes;
which thing this argument also of Paul
in the 3. chap. vnto the Galathians, doeth eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentlie
confirme in these wordes:<note place="margin">Gal. 3, 11. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>And, that
no man is iustified by the law in the sight of God, it

                  <note place="margin">The argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the aduersaries against the doctrine of iustification.</note>

               <p>The aduersaries nowe in alleadging for
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:19032:179"/>
their side against vs, the Apostle Iames, varie
not from their olde wont. For neglecting the
the most constant agreement of the whole
scripture, and of al the sainctes, of Moses, the
prophetes, of Christe, and of the Apostles,
they wrest à doubtful saying verie subtiltie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
vs.<note place="margin">The true sense of S. Iames tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching works.</note> The sense whereof would they seeke
at the occasion, and end whie it was written,
they shoulde finde that Iames disputeth not
of our iustification before God, but of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
of our iustification before men, and
that against hypocrits, who by their false, and
dead faith, or shadow of faith, did thinke the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
righteous; and yet in the meane while
defiled themselues with al manner sinnes, and
wickednes. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, seeing that the word Faith is
not taken in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> sense of the Apostles Paul, and
Iames, they do oppose the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues against y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of god, who out of their saying do seek co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarieties.
They alledge also other places, such
as concerne rewarding of good works; rende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to euerie man according to his deeds; the
blessednes promised to the poore in spirit, to
the meeke, to peace-makers, to such as endure
persecution &amp;c. But al those, and the like say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
are not contrarie to our iudgement, if any
wil rightlie distinguish betwene y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> causes, and
effectes of iustification, &amp; the qualities of the
iustified. For it is one thing to speake of the
reward of obedience, and of the qualities of
those who are alreadie iustified through
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:19032:180"/>
faith; and another thing of the causes of the
matter, that is of iustification. Againe it is one
thing, to vse the wordes of Bernarde, <hi>to speake
of the causes of gouernement, another of the waie
to the kingdome.</hi> Also it is one thing to speake
of the essential principles of à thing, another
of the principles of knowledge. But they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
against vs, as à strong buclar, the saying
of Christ,<note place="margin">Mat. 19, 17.</note> 
                  <hi>If thou wilt enter into life, keepe the
commaundementes.</hi> That is, fulfill the lawe. I
aunswere: Christ shewed à most readie waie
vnto life, euen the keeping of the commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dementes,
or fulfilling of the lawe. But for
that the fault is in vs, that wee cannot fulfill
the lawe,<note place="margin">Rom. 10, 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Christ is become the ende of the lawe
for righteousnes vnto euerie one that beleeueth.</hi>
And this is it which the same Paul saith in
another place,<note place="margin">Rom. 3, 31.</note> 
                  <hi>Through faith wee establish the
lawe,</hi> euen because through beleefe wee ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
that which the lawe requireth, namelie
righteousnes.</p>
               <p>The gift which we saide is conioined with
the faith of remission of sinnes,<note place="margin">Gifte.</note> is the giuing
of the holie Ghost, whereby the man iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
onelie by faith, is regenerated, or sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that is, is mortified, &amp; quickened, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth
à newe man, purposing thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forwarde,
as much as in him is, to order his
life according to the rule of Gods worde.
So that this gift, is the cause and beginning
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:19032:180"/>
of à newe life,<note place="margin">Luk. 1, 74.</note> and obedience. For wee are
not iustified freelie by faith, to the ende wee
shoulde hence-forth liue to sinne, but that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered
from sinne,<note place="margin">75.</note> wee shoulde serue God,
in righteousnes, and holines, all the daies of
our life. For Zacharias in his songe maketh this
to bee the ende of the knowledge of saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
concerning the remission of sinns, through
the tender mercie of our God.</p>
               <p>This ende of iustification Paule setteth in
the 6. vnto the Romanes, where by most e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident
argumentes he sheweth that sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is ioined with iustification.</p>
               <p>And thus much briefelie touching y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> grace
of iustification, and of the gifte of sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the which are linked with the faith of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of sinnes: and can no more be seuered
from the same, than maie heate from fire, or
the beame from the sunne. Whereby it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent
that the Papistes offer vs great iniurie
in saying, that we do abolish good works, and
loase y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> bridles to men, because we saie that by
faith alone wee are iustified. For they marke
not howe wee doe put a difference betweene
the proper benefite of Christ, and our duetie
which is ioined with faith. But of iustificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
God willing, wee will speake more at
large in the exposition of the last verse of this
Psalme, the sundrie sorts of testimonies which
are commonlie handled in this controuersie,
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:19032:181"/>
being distinguished.</p>
               <p>The thirde place in the application of
Christ wee ascribed to the sacramentse,<note place="margin">3. How by the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments we maie applie the sacrifice of Christ to our selues.</note> which
not onelie do offer the merites of Christ, the
priest, as the word doeth: but also as seales doe
assure the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto vs, if so be the merits of Christ
be reteined fast in the harts through faith. For
as without faith the word doth not applie the
merites of Christ: so without faith (I speake of
the elder sorte) the sacramentes doe no good.
The sacraments which Christ hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended
to his Church be two,<note place="margin">Two, &amp; no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>oe sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> to wit, Baptisme, &amp; the
Lords supper: wherof baptisme is à sacrament
of the entrance into Christianitie,<note place="margin">Baptisme whie but once mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred to ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; what i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> signifieth.</note> &amp; therefore
is but once take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as Christ died but once for vs.
For as baptisme is an effectuall token of the
death, burial, and resurrection of Christ: so is it
à sacrament of the couenant, which God ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth-into
with the baptized, touching y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
of sinnes, and our reconciliation through
Christ; so is it also à signe of repentance, and
of the crosse, and à testimonie of the resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
to come.</p>
               <p>And the Lord his supper is a sacrament of
the confirmation and conseruation of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anitie;<note place="margin">The L. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per what is signifieth; whie often receaued.</note>
yea and a remembrance of the couenant
established through the blood of Christ. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore
it is the meate whereby we are spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritualie
nourished in the bodie of Christ, &amp;
therefore often it ought to be receaued. The
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:19032:181"/>
summe of al is this, that the sacrament of the
newe testament is both an externall signe of
the couenant concerning our free iustificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
before God through the sacrifice of Christ;
and also a testifying, and confirmation of the
faith, &amp; righteousnes of Gods people to him
warde.</p>

<pb n="337" facs="tcp:19032:182"/>
and quiet conscience doth arise, the epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
vnto the Hebrewes teacheth, where it is

in al things,</hi>

is not our owne worthines (for by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
wee are sinners, and vnworthie;) nor me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites
(for of our selues we deserue nothing but
death;<note place="margin">Esai. 64, 6.</note>) nor anie vertue of our owne (for <hi>al our
righteousnes is as filthie cloutes)</hi> but euen meere
faith in Christ which purgeth it by his bloode
from dead workes, through whome we haue
peace with God:<note place="margin">Heb. 9, 14.</note> So the purpose of the same
is in all thinges,<note place="margin">Rom. 5, 1.</note> with all men, and in all acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to walke vprightlie, namelie by declining
from that which is euil, and doing that which
is good. For continualie it thinketh vppon à
newe life in Iesus Christ; it alwaies detesteth
the coate defiled of the fleshe; and euermore
delighteth in that white garment which in
Baptisme is put on.<note place="margin">Gal. 3, 17.</note> 
                  <hi>For al wee that are bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
into Christ, haue put on Christ.</hi> Which thing
Dauid in the spirit did beholde, when he said,
<hi>Wash me,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 51, 7.</note> 
                  <hi>and I shal bee whiter than snowe,</hi> to wit,
through the ornament of righteousnes of the
Messiah, as with a most white garment, being
first purged from sinne through his bloode.
Of this faith and conscience that sinne is blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted-out,
ariseth a care of wel-doing in Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:19032:183"/>
according to that,<note place="margin">Psal. 119, 112.</note> 
                  <hi>I haue applied mine heart
to fulfil thy statuts alwaie, euen vnto the end.</hi> And
Paul saith,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 1, 18. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>Fight à good fight, hauing faith &amp; à
good conscience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the whole course of this life, wee maie
beholde à goodlie, and an especial vse of the
sacrifice of Christ, not onelie in aduersitie, but
also in prosperitie. In aduersitie there is none
so good à remedie as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sacrifice of Christ. For
as aduersitie doeth put thee in minde of thy
sinne, either lurking, or manifest: so the sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of Christ apprehended by faith, doth cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
thy conscience both of the forgiuenes of
sins, whereof ariseth spiritual comfort in al af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction;
and also of the conformitie of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
with the son of God. For so it hath plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the wisedome of God, that he wil haue his
elect like to his sonne, but in the crosse, and
also in glorie.<note place="margin">2. Tim. 2, 12</note> And this Paul affirmeth, saying,
<hi>If we suffer with him, we shal also raigne with him.</hi>
Hitherto also maketh the imitation of Christ
his example in the crosse, which Peter com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth
vnto vs in these wordes:<note place="margin">1. Pet. 2, 21.</note> 
                  <hi>Christ suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
for vs, leauing vs an ensample that we shoulde
folow his steppes.</hi> Read mine annotations vpon
the 2. chapter of the first epistle of Peter.</p>
               <p>In prosperitie there is more daunger. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
aduersitie do bring-done manie: yet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speritie
doth puffe-vp moe. According to this
of the Poët, <hi>The minds of man through prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:19032:183"/>
waxe wanton often-times;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The minde of à godlie wise man in prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</note> Againe, <hi>The minde
lifted-vp through prosperitie, remembreth neither
death, nor what may happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nor anie measure at al.</hi>
What then shal à godlie man doe in this case?
Foure things he shal doe. First let him waie
with himselfe the things which are called pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperous
in this world; and consider what they
are in them selues; Secondarilie, let him thinke
what a perilous thing it is to enioie prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
if the mind be not godlie disposed; Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
let him compare al the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities of this
worlde, with the blessednes to come, which
Christ hath purchased for vs by his death; and
last of al, let him aduisedlie consider, whether
it be more behoueful to enioie prosperitie of
this life with hazard of the soule, than to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
them, if occasion serue, for Christ his
sake. Therfore seeing our flesh is ticled, &amp; like
à wild horse beginneth to winch by prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
let à godlie man thinke with himself, first,
howe vncertaine, brittle, mortal, temporal, fle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
&amp; transitorie y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prosperitie of this world
is, which manie enioieng at their hartes desire,
be for al that in verie deed most miserable: se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condlie,
let him thinke y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it hath more deceipt
than pleasure. For the pleasure which ariseth
thereof, is like à serpent murthering the soule;
counsailing proudlie and va<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>elie; euen the
spirite of couetousnes, and gluttonie. This
serpent lurking in the most secrete corners
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:19032:184"/>
of the minde, seeketh not but euen destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Whereby it is apparent that prosperitie
doeth more hurt the minde, than doeth ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersitie
the bodie. Thirdlie, let a godlie man
thinke with himselfe that so great ods there
is betweene the felicitie which Christe hath
purchased for his beloued, and the prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of this world; as is betweene a minute of an
houre, and eternitie, betweene death and life,
betweene miserie and happines. For as the
prosperitie of this life, dependeth vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a reed:
so the happines promised in Christ is vphol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
by the euerlasting trueth of God, that it
is vnpossible that they shoulde bee deceiued
of their hope, which continue in the feare of
God vnto their liues ende. Fourthlie, of these
things let a godlie ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> gather, how it is a much
better, and blessed thing to renounce world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
goods, as far as godlie &amp; christianitie they
stand not according to Gods word, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
to bring the soule into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> danger of damnation.
To conclude that wee bee neither puffed-vp,
nor carried-quite from God by prosperitie,
there is no such thing, as to call into minde
the humiliation of the sonne of God vppon
the crosse, who therefore was humbled, that
he might exalt vs, if so be we do humble our
selues vnder the mightie hand of God, and are
not ashamed of the crosse of Christ.<note place="margin">1. Pet. 5, 6.</note> 
                  <hi>For whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
exalteth himselfe, shal be brought lowe, and
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:19032:184"/>
he that humbleth himself,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luk 14, 11.</note> 
                  <hi>shal be exalted.</hi> We are
therefore to take special heede, least our flesh
through prosperous successe of things, do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue
and kil vs being taken with a certaine
baite. For that serpent which beguiled Euah
of his subtiltie, snatcheth euerie occasion to
withdrawe vs from Christ,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 1, 26.</note> and setteth vppon
the principal part of man, to destroie it with
prosperitie. And therefore saith Paul, <hi>Brethren
you see your calling, howe that not manie wise men
after the fleshe, not manie mightie, not manie no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
are called.</hi> For to the destruction of man sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than
abuseth these three things, namelie wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
power, and nobilitie, (of which sprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
both the pleasure of the bodie, and the
pride of minde,) which if the foolish once get,
they think themselues happie and blissed me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
So then against this tentation oppose y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> crosse
of Christ, without which al wisedome is but
meere foolishnesse; all might is but weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;
all nobilitie is but ignominie; and all
pleasure is but the food of death. For al these
mixed with too much bitternes, haue an ende
with this life. If therefore thou wouldest
haue true wisedom,<note place="margin">Col. 2, 3.</note> true might, true nobilitie,
true pleasure and glorie, seeke them in Christ
alone, &amp; thou shalt find, <hi>in whom are hid al the
treasures of celestial restes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To conclude, at the point of death, the
sight of the prieste Christ with his sacrifice
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:19032:185"/>
taketh awaie all feare of death; and maketh à
ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> no more to dread death than a sweet sleep.
Whereof it is that a godlie man desireth death
euen as à passage out of these miseries vnto e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlasting
life. Then shal he find the saying of
Christ to be true,<note place="margin">Iohn. 8, 52.</note> 
                  <hi>If à man keepe my worde, hee
shal neuer tast death.</hi> Hence proceedeth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingnes
in manie of the Martyrs, who had in
minde Christ not onelie that died, but also y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
did rise againe, by whose power we shal be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
vnto immortalitie; and our soules in the
meane space, euen vntil the daie of the laste
iudgement shal possesse the ioies of heauen
with the chast spirits, and then ioined to their
bodies shal enioie the sight of God, &amp; immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
glorie for euer and euer. And therefore it is
not without iust cause,<note place="margin">Reue. 14, 13</note> said both in the Reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
<hi>Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord;</hi>
and also by Dauid,<note place="margin">Psa. 116, 15</note> 
                  <hi>Precious in the sight of the
Lord is the death of his saincts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus hitherto we haue spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> concerning
the propitiatorie sacrifice of Christians, &amp; of
such things as do seeme to make for the plane

               </p>
               <p>Firste therefore it is to bee noted,<note place="margin">Ephes. 2, 3.</note> that as
by nature wee bee sinners, and the children

as by that onelie sacrifice of Christ, wee bee

did annoint their heades; and fourthlie fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

For first the high priest eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Christ, doth wash

               <p>For as the nature of the oile, wherewithal

is to shine and to burne: so the holie Spirite,

               <p>
                  <hi>And being thus ordained,</hi>

                  <hi>we haue a certaine
couenant also concluded betweene God and

Malachie: The words of the Prophet are these,</hi>
My couenant was with him of life and peace, and
I gaue him feare,<note place="margin">Mal. 2, 5.</note> and he feared me, and was afraid
before my name.<note place="margin">6.</note> The lawe of truth was in his
mouth, and there was none iniquitie founde in his
lips; he walked with me in peace and equitie, and
did turne manie awaie from iniquitie.<note place="margin">7.</note> For the
Priestes lips should preserue knowledge, and theie
should seeke the lawe at his mouth: for he is the
messenger of the Lorde of hostes.</p>
               <p>And although the Prophete here speaketh
of the Leuitical priestes: yet it is fitlie applied
also to al Christians, who are in the sight of
God, much more excellent priestes, being roi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
than were the Leuitical. Out of which
wordes of the Prophet, the forme of the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
maie thus be made. As the Lorde promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
life and peace: so doth he require also
feare through faith. For as in al couenantes
there is à mutual obligation: so here too God
promiseth peace and life, which two thinges
are opposed against the wrath of God, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlasting
death. But the partes of the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:19032:187"/>
in respect of our selues are manie in this
place,<note place="margin">Paries of the couena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t betweene God and Christian Priestes.</note> which naturalie do hang together. The
first whereof is à syncere feare of God spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Faith, which the Prophete meaneth
when he saith: <hi>The beginning of wisedome is the
feare of the Lorde.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psa. 111. 10.</note> Againe, <hi>The holie feare of
the Lorde endureth for euer.</hi> The second <hi>the
lawe of truth in his mouth,</hi> that is true, holie, &amp;
sounde doctrine. And although eùerie Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
màie not teach publiquelie: yet is it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie
that all Christians do both knowe,
and confesse too the doctrine of Christ.</p>
               <p>The third; <hi>and there is none iniquitie founde
in his lips,</hi> that is, he shunneth false and forged
doctrine, yea and abhorreth as the pestilence
whatsoeuer commeth not from the mouth of
the Lorde. And therefore Christe saith to all:
<hi>Beware of false Prophetes.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matt. 7, 15.</note> The fourth, <hi>He wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
in peace and equitie,</hi> that is, he studied to
order his life according to the rule of my iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
by keeping peace, and equitie with his
neighbours. And this parte of the couenant
Christ also and the Apostles doe applie to all
Christians. The fifte, <hi>He turned manie awaie
from iniquitie,</hi> to wit both by word, by deede,
&amp; by example, &amp; this euerie man wil grant al
Christians ought to do. To conclude, as God

Christ. For of right our consecration into the
priesthoode of Christ doth require the same.</p>
               <p>Because we are priestes to offer sacrifices,
not propitiatorie, which belonged onelie to
Iesus Christ the hie priest; but Eucharistical,
and those perpetual.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, as the Leuites at certaine daies,
&amp; appointed houres did offer according vnto
the Lawe of Moses, and after waited vntil
their turne came, after the Ecclesiastical ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of Dauid: So are not Christian priestes
to intermitte sacrifice, but continualie, and
without ceassing theie must haue ful handes,
and offer continual sacrifice vnto the Lorde.</p>
               <p>What is Eucharistical sacrifice?<note place="margin">Eucharisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice what;</note> The Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charistical

with salt, it is inflamed and sanctified by
the holie Ghoste, as by fire from heauen, and
through the merite of Christe is accepted of
God into glorie through y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same Iesus Christ.
And this is called an Eucharistical sacrifice
from the proper end thereof; because it is an
oblation of our thankfulnes. For being recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled
to God, through the propitiatorie sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of Christ, we offer to him our obedience,
we honor, &amp; praise him, and continualie giue
him thankes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="350" facs="tcp:19032:189"/>
For Christ being apprehended by faith, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
the holie Ghost, which createth à newe
heart within vs, and à willing minde, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bie
we offer this our gratefulnes to God.</p>
               <p>Nowe it is necessarie that we consider why
our obedience is called à sacrifice. For the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of this phraze wil notablie stir vs vp vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the studie of obedience.<note place="margin">The workes of Christians whie called a sacrifice.</note> So then the workes
of Christians are called sacrifices by à certaine
relation vnto the sacrifices of the olde Iewes.
For as theie were commanded from heauen to
the Priestes, were chosen, applied, sanctified,
and accepted: so in our sacrifices it is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
that there be à commandement, à choise, an
application, a sanctificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and that they be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
of God. In y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> old law it was not lawful
to offer à sow, or anie vnclean beast by the law
but onlie such as were cleane according to the
lawe: So the workes that Christians should
offer, must not be vncleane, that is either for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
by the worde of God, or hypocritical,
or superstitious; but such as GOD comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth.
Therefore the Lorde saith by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet:
<hi>Walke in my statutes.</hi> Secondlie, as the
cleane lambe which should be offered, was se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
from the rest of the flocke: So by faith
our workes are to be separated from the like
workes of prophane people. The Pharisee
gaue almes, so did Cornelius the Courtier: yet
was the Pharisees almes vncleane, &amp; the cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:19032:189"/>
cleane, because through faith it was sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
from the almes of the Pharisee. Thirdlie,
as the ceremonial sacrifice was applied to the
altar by the hand of the priest beeing laide
there-vpon: so our workes shal be applied to
the altar through Christ, by whose handling
they are sanctified. Fourthlie, as those olde sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices
were consumed with fire from heauen
and sanctified, and so accepted: so our sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
through the merite of Christ, inflamed by
the holie Ghost, are sanctified with fire from
heauen, and are accepted through Christe, as
Peter saith. For seeing al our own obedience is
vnperfect, &amp; in euerie work we offend partlie
by omitting somewhat, partlie by doing more
than we ought (for at no time our obedience is
perfect, and ful) it cannot be that our sacrifices
of them-selues should please God. Wherefore
as through the merite of Christ theie are san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified:
so also through Christ, as Peter saith,
theie are acceptable. For Christ maketh our
obedience grateful, and deserueth, that our o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
both in the crosse, &amp; also in the lawe
of sacrifice is commended. So y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> our sacrifices
please not in respect of any excellencie of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
but throgh Christ, in who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God waieth our
works, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he maie accept them as most worthie
sacrifices. For as the faultie sacrifice of the olde
people, which came to the altar through error,
&amp; touched y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> altar, was not cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged for a better,
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:19032:190"/>
but was taken as purged, and holie by reason
it had touched the holie place: so our workes,
albeit theie are verie faultie, yet become theie
cleane, and apte for holie sacrifice, and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to GOD through touching our altar
Christ, who through faith is touched. And
although the summe of the doctrine of the
Christians sacrifices maie be vnderstoode, by
that wich is spoken: yet to make it the more
euident, we wil more particularlie entreate
of them, that it maie appeare howe theie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
together, and folowe each of other.</p>
               <p>Among the sacrifices of Christians in the
first place,<note place="margin">Kindes of Eucharisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal sacrifices.</note> is the offering of our selues, which
is done in Baptisme, and answereth to the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing
which was vsed at the consecration of
Leuitical Priestes.<note place="margin">1. We offer sacrifice as Baptisme.</note> For through baptisme we
are visiblie, and sacramentalie seuered from
the prophane world, applied to God, laide
vpon the altar Iesus Christ, &amp; sanctified both
by renouncing the diuel and al his workes, &amp;
by promising due obedience vnto God for
the aduauncement of his glorie.</p>
               <p>In the second place of the elder sort,<note place="margin">2. Christians do offer sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice when theie dailie crucifie their wicked affections.</note> there
is required à continual, and perpetual oblation
as it were, wherebie we offer our selues who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
and al that we haue, vnto God. Of this
sacrifice speaketh Paule, where he saith, <hi>I
beseech you brethren, by the mercies of God, that
ye giue-vp your bodies à liuing sacrifice,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 13, 1.</note> 
                  <hi>holie,
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:19032:190"/>
and acceptable vnto God, which is your reasonable
seruing of God; and fashion not your selues like vnto
this world, but be ye changed by the renuing of your
minde, that ye maie proue what is the good wil of
God, acceptable, and perfect.</hi> In these wordes
Paule doth notablie expresse what it was that
shadowed the sacrifices of the olde lawe. For
as the burnt-sacrifices did wholie sauor of the
holie fire: so our mindes must be wholie infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by the holie Ghost, which is the heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
fire; that both whatsoeuer is of the flesh,
maie by little and little be consumed, and be
brought vnto deade ashes, as it were, and
that which is spiritual and of the minde, maie
be made truelie spiritual and heauenlie, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
the force of that celestial fire. A sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowe
whereof was the prohibition to eate
porke and the killing beastes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For as porke
betokeneth vncleannesse, from which we
must abstaine; and beasts killed did signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
that beastlie affections should be killed:
So the minde and will must be renued, that it
maie allowe, chuse, and doe such thinges as
please God. And because al sacrifices of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
ought to be seasoned by faith as with
salt, and laide vpon the altar, which is Christ,
therefore Paul beeing iustified through faith,
commendeth this kinde of sacrifice. Here
would be noted howe fitlie the name of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
agreeth here-vnto, and howe aptlie
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:19032:191"/>
Paul doth applie the same. First he requireth
that we separat our selues through faith fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
prophane gentiles,<note place="margin">Rom. 12, 2.</note> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he saith; <hi>Fashio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not your
selues like vnto this world;</hi> Secondlie he wil haue
vs to be applied to god, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he saith, <hi>But be ye
cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged by the renuing of your mind,</hi> which cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge
is made through the spirite of regeneration;
Thirdlie, he wil haue vs <hi>to giue vp our selues à li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
sacrifice</hi> vpon our onelie Altar, which
is Christe. For as in the earthlie Ierusalem
there was onelie but one Altar for Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:
So likewise in the heauenlie there is
but one, vppon which we doe offer, when
we depend vpon the merite of Christe that
<hi>our Sacrifice maie be holie, and acceptable vnto
GOD,</hi> which we saide was to haue the
fourth place in our Sacrifices. But what
is the cause whie GOD requreth this kinde
of Sacrifice at our handes? It is necessarie
that as sinne made vs mortal, so we likewise
slaie sinne, by the vertue of Christ his death,
yea, and kil wicked affections in our selues.
For if Christe on our behalfe woulde so doe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
howe much more are we bounde for his sake
willinglie to offer this Sacrifice?<note place="margin">Rom. 6, 10.</note> 
                  <hi>In that he

               <p>The thirde place among the Sacrifices of

                     </gap> do offer sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice when theie praise God.</note> which ought not to be separated from
the former. Of this mention is made in the
Psalme:<note place="margin">Psal. 50, 23<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 14.</note> 
                  <hi>He that offereth praise, shal glorifie
me;</hi> Againe, <hi>Offer vnto GOD praise.</hi> And
the Prophet Hosea,<note place="margin">Hos. 14, 3.</note> 
                  <hi>We wil render the calues
of our lippes.</hi> Then we doe offer the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
of praise, when we acknowledge
God to be the fountaine of al good thinges;
and when by our confession we praise and
glorifie him. By which kinde of Sacrifice
the fleshe is bereaued of al glorie of deserte,
wisedome, righteousnesse, power, &amp;c. and
it is ascribed to God alone. Which is then
rightlie offered when through faith that
praise is separated from the praise of the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risee,
and through the same faith is brought
vnto GOD, and laide vpon our Altar, that
is, dependeth vpon the merite of Christe;
wherbie it is acceptable and grateful to God.
A part of this sacrifice I made confession of the
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:19032:192"/>
faith, especialie in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time of persecution, which
confession is necessarie in foure respects.<note place="margin">Confession of the faith in the time of persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whie ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie;</note> First,
that God maie be honoured; Secondlie, that
the trueth maie be defended; Thirdlie, that
the godlie maie be confirmed; Lastlie, that
the wicked through the constancie of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
maie be conuerted, and saued. For these
causes Paule saith,<note place="margin">Rom. 10, 10.</note> 
                  <hi>That with the mouth confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is made vnto saluation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the fourth place set we the sacrifice of
praier;<note place="margin">4. Christians doe sacrifice when theie praie.</note> which was signified by the perfume of
the old Lawe, as Dauid interpreteth it, when
he saith:<note place="margin">Psal. 14, 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Let my praier be directed in thie sight as
incense; and the lifting-vp of my hands, as an eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
sacrifice.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Reuel. 5, 8.</note> And Iohn in the Reuelation; <hi>The
Elders had seuen phials ful of odors, which are the
praiers of the Saints.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mich. 6, 6.</note> And the Prophet Micheas
doth saie, <hi>Wherewith shal I come before the
Lorde?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">8.</note> and, <hi>He wil that thou humble thy knee.</hi>
Praier then made in the knowledge, and faith
of the Sonne of God, is saide to be à sacrifice
more sweete than anie incense. The name of
sacrifice doth therefore agree to the praier of
Christians, because through faith it is separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from the praiers both of Iewes, Turkes,
and other prophane people; and by the same
it is brought, and presented before God, and
laid-vpon the altar Christ, while it dependeth
vpon his merit, and is set on fire by an ardent
affection of the holie Ghost. Whereby it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:19032:192"/>
before God, and hearkened-vnto.</p>
               <p>In the fift place followeth the sacrifice of
repentance.<note place="margin">5. Christians doe offer sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to God when theie repent vnfainedlie.</note> For seeing the Saintes do dailie
offend, they haue need dailie to repent, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they both acknowledge their owne faults;
and flee-backe through faith vnto their propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation;
and endeuor afterward to kepe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al pollution of wickednes. So Dauid
hauing committed adulterie, did vnfeignedlie
repent, &amp; offered to God the sacrifice of à co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite
spirit,<note place="margin">Psal. 51, 17.</note> and of an humbled minde. For so he
saith: <hi>The sacrifices of God are à contrite spirit; à
contrite and à broken heart, O God, thou wilt not
despise.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Isai. 57, 15.</note> And in Isaiah the Lorde saith; <hi>I dwel

Againe,<note place="margin">Isai. 66<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2,</note> 
                  <hi>To him wil I looke, euen to him that is
poore, and of à contrie spirit, and trembleth at my
wordes.</hi> This contrition, and this humiliation I
take to be inward, namelie when we are true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
touched with the sense of sinne, and vnfai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedlie
are humbled vnder the mightie hande
of God, who threateneth euerlasting wrath,
and malediction for our sinnes. This power
of the worde of God Ieremiah the Prophete,
sheweth by à double comparison, in these
words: <hi>Is not my worde like à fire, saith the Lord;
and like an hammar,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iere. 23, 29.</note> 
                  <hi>that breaketh the stone?</hi>
Moreouer, this contrition of the heart, and
this humiliation is then an holie sacrifice to
the honour of God, when through faith it is
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:19032:193"/>
separated from worldelie sorrowe, such as
Cains, Achitophels, and Iudas was, and
when by the same faith it is laide vpon
the altar Christ, by whose merite it is san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified,
and accepted, as we see in Dauid.
For he in the middest of al his vexations of
minde, ranne vnto the mercie of God, and
beleeued howe his sinne was pardoned
through the sacrifice of Christ. This kinde
of sacrifice proposeth plentiful store of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forte
before the eies of miserable sinners,
which are griued with the heauie burthen of
their sinnes. For when it telleth the sinner
that à contrite and à sorrowful heart is in the
nostrils of God as à sacrifice of sweete in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense,
it euidentlie sheweth both that our
repentance pleaseth God; and that GOD
earnestlie requireth the same; and that he
wil also receiue such as vnfeinedlie repent
into fauour againe. Let vs therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
that with Caine we saie not, <hi>Mine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie
is greater then Gods mercie:</hi> but with
Augustine rather, <hi>Thou liest Caine; for grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is Gods mercie, then the iniquitie of al sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</hi>
And therefore let vs offer vnto God
the sacrifice of à contrite and broken hearte,
contrite with the hammer of the Lawe;
broken vnder the mightie hande of GOD;
and let vs beleeue that God for his Christs
sake doth trulie pardon such as by true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:19032:193"/>
forsake their sinnes.</p>
               <p>Let the sixt kinde of sacrifice be obedience
in the crosse,<note place="margin">6. Christians do sacrifice, when theie suffer affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tientlie.</note> and in euerie outward affliction.
This obedience is likewise adorned with the
name of sacrifice, that we may knowe how
God liketh verie wel thereof. For, as the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
of Christ in the crosse was à grateful
sacrifice to God: so our obedience in al trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
pleaseth God, not for it selfe, but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of faith, whereby it is seuered from the
punishments of the vngodly, is laide vpon the

sanctified, and accepted of God. So Iob se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parateth

               <p>Beside the aboue numbred kindes of sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,
which are common to al Christians, of
what state or degree soeuer they be, there is
one more peculiar to the Ministers of the
Gospel. Whereof Paule speaketh after this
manner:<note place="margin">Rom. 15, 15</note> 
                  <hi>Grace is giuen me of God, that I should
be the minister of Iesus Christe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">16.</note> 
                  <hi>toward the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:19032:194"/>
ministring the Gospel of God, that the offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
vp of the Gentiles might be acceptable, being
sanctified by the holie Ghost.</hi> Here Paul allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
vnto the mysteries which were ministred
by the Leuitical Priestes, saith, he doth mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
the Gospel of God, that is, doth make him
selfe à Priest in the ministerie of the Gospel,
while he bringeth the hearers of the Gospel,
from the wickednes of the worlde, maketh
them to obeie the wil of God, laieth them v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
the altar Christ, by whose blood theie be
purified, by whose obedience iustified, and by
whose spirit theie are sanctified, that their sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
maie be acceptable to God through
Iesus Christ. Nowe seeing the like reason
is of al the ministers of the Gospel, and the
same ende, namelie to bring men vnto Christ,
hauing renounced the vngodlines<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of the
world, that through the holie spirit theie maie
be sanctified, to the ende their oblation maie
be holie and accepted of God through Christ,
it is manifest that theie maie fitlie be called
Priestes, by which title both theie themselues
are put in minde of the dignitie of their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterie,
of the efficacie of the word, and of the
courage of minde &amp; constancie that is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in so greate à place; and the hearers to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue
much comfort, while theie perceaue
that their obedience toward the Gospel is set
forth with the title of sacrifice. Wherebie
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:19032:195"/>
we maie vnderstand howe grateful the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion
of sinners,<note place="margin">The mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of the Gospel how and when priestes.</note> is before God. As of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
therefore as the ministers of the Gospel
through sound doctrine either do conuert In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels
vnto Christ, or reuoke such as goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straie,
or lift vp those which were fallen, or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> obstinate, or finalie awake such as are
secure and sluggish, theie do the office of gods
priestes, and maie rightlie be caled the priests
of God. Who as the Leuitical priestes vnder
one hie priest, so theie vnder one Christ, the
onlie propiciatorie sacrifice, doe solemnize
the holie mysteries, teaching the Gospel of
Christ. But then &amp; not afore deserue theie this
honorable title, when both by sound doctrine
and holie conuersatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theie set vpon the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of Sathan, and builde vp of the temple
of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For it belongeth vnto the ministers of
God not onelie by words to teach, but also by
good workes to giue light vnto others, that
therbie, namelie through synceritie of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
and innocencie of life, as it were by two
torches, they maie conduct me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of darknes into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kingdome of light. So
that theie are, as to teach the trueth of the gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
by words, so to expresse the same by their
liues, that outwarlie men maie behold that
with their eies in example, which by voice is
vttered for the edification of their minds. For
when theie teach trulie, but liue wickedlie,
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:19032:195"/>
theie become guiltie of most horrible sins. For
theie bring the gospel into contempt with the
aduersaries of the same; theie make but à mock

theie teach others; theie ouerthrow them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,

and finalie whereas theie shoulde be exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples

how the Church of God, is happie &amp; bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed;
Secondlie, what special seruice God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth
of the Church; Thirdlie, that the
Church is immortal, and shal euerlastinglie
continue, which agreeth with the first verse.
And because aboue vpon the first verse we
haue spoken of the House of God (which is
the Church) I wil not in this place discourse
thereof at large.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="365" facs="tcp:19032:196" rendition="simple:additions"/>
But because this verse maketh mention of
Blessednes, which thing man through the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
of nature desireth (and is called of the
Philosophers with one consent <hi>eudaimonia,</hi> &amp;
of diuines somtime felicitie, and somtime bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sednes,
I thinke it good in this place to speake
somewhat touching the true felicitie of man:
for which he was both at the first created, and
afterward redeemed. And this is euidentlie
to be seene both by our creation after the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
of our God, and also by the restoring
of that same Image through Christ. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
al men doe grant, that the ende of
mans nature, is to atteine a perfect state,
which being atteined, it is iudged perfect and
blessed: yet foulie haue diuers Philosophers
erred in defining this perfect state of man,
wherein the true felicitie doth consist. So that
diuers and manifolde are the opinions of the
Philosophers therabout: al which Platoes on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
excepted, shal come to nothing, when we
haue set downe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> true definitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of happines, &amp;
showen for what thing chieflie man is borne.</p>
               <p>Forasmuch as à miserable man and à blessed
are contrarie,<note place="margin">Who trulie happie.</note> it cannot be doubted, but he
rightlie and trulie maie be caled <hi>happie,</hi> who
is not onelie without al sense of trouble, and
sorrowe, and dreadeth none euil to come,
but also which doth so abounde with store
of al good thinges, that he can desire no
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:19032:197"/>
more, being sure perpetuallie to possesse the
good thinges wherewith he doth abounde.
This is the definition of absolute and perfecte
happinesse: nowe whoso bindeth himselfe
with à right course to atteine the same, is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
happie, in respecte of the euent. By which
definition it appeareth,<note place="margin">God princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palie and through himselfe happie.</note> how God principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
and indeede through himselfe, is hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie.
For, as he through himselfe is subiect
to no miserie at al, and voide of al feare of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil:
so he aboundeth with al good thinges.
(for he is euen goodnes it selfe) and dreadeth
no chaunge. Secondarilie, because God hath
fashioned man after his owne image, his wil
is that man should be blessed through partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of his blessednes. For, as the principal &amp;
chiefe bewtie of à godlie bodie is in the liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
and true face indeede; and next in the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
and picture which doth represent the
bodie: So mans nature, which is the image
and portraiture of supernal happines, is then
happie indeede, when it inioieth the possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of this happinesse; which doubtlesse is not
fraile, fleeting, or temporarie, but of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance,
perpetual, and euerlasting. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
one maie rightlie define that to be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end
of man,<note place="margin">End of man what.</note> which maketh him perfect &amp; blessed.
The conditions of which ende are diuers, as
that it is proper to man; that it belongeth
to al men that beside the same nothing is to
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:19032:197"/>
be desired; that it is voide of al trouble; that it
is eternal; and neede not be feared that it can
be taken awaie.</p>
               <p>Now that the true blessednes of man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth
in this ende, it is manifest out of the
worde of God, which doth testifie how man
was created after the image of God, &amp; placed
in Paradise. Which thing maie be seene also in
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> natural appetite of euerie ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For as Cicero
saith,<note place="margin">Fal of man.</note> 
                  <hi>we al would be blessed.</hi> But because our
first parents through their free wil did sinne,
yeelding to the suggestions of Satan, in them
and with them we fel from this state of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.
For as the Prophet saith, <hi>Our iniquities
haue separated betweene vs and our God.</hi> So that
through sinne we are become of blessed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treemelie
miserable, &amp; so blinde, that of our
selues we canne neither see, nor vnderstand
the perfecte state of mans nature for which it
was created. And hereof sprang so manie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions
of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> blinde Philosophers touching the
true happines, in al ages. Wherefore God, of
his infinite goodnes, taking pittie vpon vs,
sent his Sonne the verie image of his owne
substance, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> through him we might recouer
the image after which we were made. For this
his Son sheweth the readie waie, wherebie we
maie returne vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> happines which was lost,
the image of God being repaired within vs;
wherebie as Iohn writeth,<note place="margin">1. Iohn 3, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

for euermore, being ioined to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chiefest bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sednes,
namelie to God himselfe, in whome
who so doth abide without doubt he shal e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlastinglie

abounde with goodnes and glorie, for euer &amp;
euer.</p>
               <p>But what?<note place="margin">An obiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> saith not our Lorde, <hi>Blessed are
theie that mourne,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 5, 4. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>Blessed are theie which suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
persecution?</hi> Certainelie where mourning is
and persecution, there also trouble is, &amp; want
of good thinges, &amp; feare of greater miserie.</p>
               <p>I answere:<note place="margin">2. Tim. 2, 12</note> we must distinguish betweene
the waie vnto happines, and the ful fruition
of the same. While we liue in this worlde, we
are in the waie either towarde endlesse mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
or eternal blessednesse; but our bodies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
raised againe, we shalbe either euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinglie
miserable, or euerlastinglie blessed.
And thereof the state of our life is saide to be
either happie, or wretched in respect of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent.
For which cause there is no truer hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines
of this life, than that which beginneth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlasting
happines, &amp; no truer miserie than y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

phrazes of speech doe meane, in which godlie
men are called blessed, namelie because theie
are in the waie, and go-forward vnto that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines,
which theie begin in this world. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
saith Dauid,<note place="margin">Psal. 119, 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Blessed are they which are vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
in the waie.</hi> And for instruction sake there
maie foure steps of this waie be set-downe; of
which in order we will entreate.</p>
               <p>The first steppe,<note place="margin">The first step vnto heauen.</note> is to haue, and to heare
the worde of God, that is, the Lawe, and the
Gospel of Iesus Christ. By the one, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
the Lawe, we learne how miserable we are
through sinne,<note place="margin">Isai. 5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>which hath separated betweene
vs, and our God,</hi> the fountaine of true happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;
by the other, to wit, the Gospel, howe
blessed we shal be here-after, if we hearken
vnto the worde which pointeth vnto Christ,
the onelie waie to blisse. Without this step,
none, be he neuer so wise, neuer so mightie, so
noble, so rich, so at heartes ease and pleasure,
can attaine so much as à smal hope of blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
Wherefore when the Lorde saieth,
<hi>Blessed are theie which heare the worde of God,
and keepe it;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luk. 11, 28.</note> And Dauid,<note place="margin">Psal. 1, 1, 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Blessed is the man which
doth meditate in the Lawe of the Lorde daie and
night;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 119, 2.</note> Againe, <hi>Blessed are theie which keepe his
testimonies, and seeke him with their whole heart,</hi>
                  <pb n="370" facs="tcp:19032:199"/>
theie doe point vnto this first steppe vnto
blessednesse.</p>
               <p>Philosophie,<note place="margin">Excellencie of God his worde.</note> and the wisedome of this
world, be it highlie commended; yet what is
it, being compared to this worde, which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recteth
vs vnto euerlasting happinesse? Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophie,<note place="margin">Worldlie wisedome.</note>
and worldlie wisedome, what else can
it do, than rule this transitorie, which wee cal
the natural life, which is contained within à
verie smal compasse of time? But heauenlie
wisedome sheweth vs the life of grace, which
is immortal, and the beginning of happinesse.
Hence then we maie see, and weie the worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the doctrine of the Church, which
sheweth the waie vnto eternal life &amp; blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
to al men. But humane reason is much
deceaued here. For when it seeth manie nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of men at this daie to want the worde of
God, it forgeth destinies, and is carried-awaie
with Stoical imaginations, so that contrarie
vnto Gods worde, it thinketh that God is an
accepter of persons, and wil not the saluation
of al men, but onelie of à fewe. When this was
obiected to Paul,<note place="margin">Rom. 10, 18</note> he made this answere; <hi>Haue
theie not heard? No doubt their sound went-out
through al the earth, and their words into the ends
of the world.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Tim. 2, 4.</note> So that the Gospel hath soun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
ouer the whole earth; wherebie God do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
testifie, that he would haue all men to be
saued.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="371" facs="tcp:19032:199"/>
But manie at this daie neither haue, neither
doe theie heare the Gospel? That is verie true.
But the reason our Lord yeeldeth, where he
saith,<note place="margin">Mat. 21, 43</note> 
                  <hi>The kingdome of God shalbe taken from you,
and shalbe giuen to à nation, which shal bring-forth
the fruites thereof.</hi> The cause hereof in this
place is expressed plainlie to be the extreme
ingratitude of men toward God. For when he
offereth them saluation, theie doe kil his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,
and abuse Christe with contumelious
speeches. And therefore iustlie he doth pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishe
them in taking the meane of saluation
from the vngrateful. So that the nations of
men, which haue not the worde of God, shold
not bring destinies into our mindes, but these
two thinges rather.<note place="margin">What is to be learned by seeing manie nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons at this daie with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of Christe.</note> First that the displeasure
of God against the contemners of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
is verie greeuous, whereof it is that often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
he suffereth his worde vtterlie to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from the vngrateful, and their seede after
them, who together with their parentes, doe
foster vngodlinesse in their heartes: Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
that, being made more warie by the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of others, we shewe our selues thankefull
to God for his Gospel, bringing forth fruites
worthie the Gospel, which vnlesse we doe,
we shal, as theie are and perchance more gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouslie,
be punished; which thing we maie
learne by the parable of the vine.<note place="margin">Mat. 21, 33</note>
               </p>
               <p>Nowe in what sorte we are to strengthen
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:19032:200"/>
our mindes against Stoical imaginations tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
particulars, we haue else-where decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
especialie vpon the 9. Chapter vnto the
Romans, and vpon the first vnto the Ephes.</p>
               <p>Neither do I meane,<note place="margin">Howe the word brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> that the Word simplie
is à step vnto blessednes, but with an adiunct,
namelie when it is beleeued. For vnlesse we
giue credite vnto the worde when we heare in
the same,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 2, 16.</note> the sound of the Gospel is to vs euen
the sauour of death, that is, the verie waie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
euerlasting miserie, not of it owne nature,
but through our default, and cursed ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.
And that the knowledge of the word, &amp;
faith, are to be ioined-together in the first step,
our Lord sheweth, when he saith, <hi>This is life e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iohn 17, 3.</note>
                  <hi>that theie knowe thee to be the onelie verie
God, and Iesus to be Christ, whom thou hast sent.</hi>
For knowledge comprehendeth both an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
out of the worde, and faith also
proceeding from knowledg. Therefore when
it is saide,<note place="margin">Luk. 11, 28.</note> 
                  <hi>Blessed are theie which heare the word,</hi>
must be vnderstood with a condition of faith.
Nowe whie the hearers of the worde, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuers
are blessed, Paul teacheth, when out of
the 32. Psalme he saith, <hi>Blessed are theie whose
iniquities are forgiuen.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 4, 7.</note> Howe so? Because
theie which beleeue the word of God offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
free reconciliation, haue remission of
sinnes, theie which haue remission of sins, be
righteous; but the righteous shal liue, euen by
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:19032:200"/>
the sentence of the Lawe, an euerlasting life,
which theie begin in this world; theie which
liue an euerlasting life, are blessed; therefore
such as beleeue the Gospel, are blessed, as
theie which are now in the right waie, and goe
on toward happinesse.</p>
               <p>The second step,<note place="margin">The 2. step vnto heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> is through obedience to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
God to proceede in the waie, according
to the rule of the worde, and spirite of faith.
This doth Dauid meane,<note place="margin">Psal. 112, 1.</note> when he saith, <hi>Blessed
is the man that feareth the Lorde, and delighteth
greatlie in his commandementes;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psa. 119, 1.</note> Againe, <hi>Blessed
are those that are vpright in their waie;</hi> and our
Lord when he said,<note place="margin">Matth. 5, 5.</note> 
                  <hi>Blessed are the meeke, blessed
are the peacemakers, blessed are the pure in heart,
blessed are the merciful.</hi> Which formes of
speech containe not, as the Papistes do gesse,
the causes of blessednes; but theie describe the
qualities and studies of such men as are alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
become the heires of the kingdome of
God. For the nature of faith is such, that it stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
vs, in whome it dwelleth, to shewe obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
vnto the Lord; or, as Paule saith, to
serue God through righteousnesse, after such
time as the burden of sinne is remoued-awaie
from vs, and we are made righteous through
the righteousnesse of Christ,<note place="margin">Rom. 10, 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Who is the end of
the lawe for righteousnesse vnto euerie one that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeueth.</hi>
So that the Papistes doe verie il, when
theie doe not rightlie with Paule distinguish
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:19032:201"/>
betweene the proper benefite of Christe, and
our due obedience. For so Paule vnto the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesians
doth write:<note place="margin">Ephes. 2, 8</note> 
                  <hi>By grace are ye saued tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
faith, and that not of your selues, it is the gift
of God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">9.</note> 
                  <hi>not of workes, least anie man should boast
himselfe.</hi> This doth Paule speake of the proper
benefite of Christe, afterward that followeth
which doth concerne our due obedience, and
the cause thereof:<note place="margin">10.</note> 
                  <hi>For we are his workemanship
created in Christ Iesus vnto good workes, which
God hath ordained, that we should walke in them.</hi>
What thing I praie you could be spoken more
plainlie?</p>
               <p>The third step,<note place="margin">The 3. step vnto heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> is, when necessitie requireth,
to keepe on the right waie through the valeie
of teares. For as in the Actes of the Apostles
it is saide,<note place="margin">Act. 14, 22.</note> 
                  <hi>We must through manie afflictions en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into the kingdome of God;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Tim. 3, 12</note> And Paul, <hi>Al that
wil liue godlie in Christ Iesus, shal suffer persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
It can not therefore be otherwise, but
that the godlie going on to heauen ward, must
be enforced to suffer sundrie and diuers trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.<note place="margin">Iob 5, 17.</note>
This Iob doth meane, when he saith: <hi>Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

                  <hi>For he maketh the wound, and bindeth it vp,
he smiteth, and his handes make whole.</hi> For, as
Paul saith,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 11, 32</note> 
                  <hi>When we are iudged, we are chastened
of the Lord, because we should not be condemned
with the world.</hi> And Christ, <hi>Blessed are then

                  <note place="margin">Matt. 5, 10.</note>
                  <hi>Blessed are yee when men reuile you;</hi>

toward which theie goe, while patientlie bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

the waie vnto the kingdome through Christ.</p>
               <p>The fourth step,<note place="margin">The 4. step vnto heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> is, to runne the course of
this life, in the feare of God euen vnto the
last gaspe of life. Hereof spake the Lorde,
when he saide:<note place="margin">Mat. 10, 22.</note> 
                  <hi>He that endureth to the ende, he
shalbe saued.</hi>

which faith,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 1, 9.</note> as Peter saith, <hi>is the saluation of
soules.</hi> Wherebie it is apparent, that blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
is ascribed to the aboue mentioned degrees
with á condition of perseuerance euen to the

And vnto the Hebrues,<note place="margin">Heb. 3, 14.</note> 
                  <hi>We are made partakers

the steppes vnto life, and euerlasting blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
because theie keepe vs in the waie vnto

               <p>Moreouer,<note place="margin">Where the soules of the righteous are vntil the daie of iudgement.</note> the bodies being dead, the soules

there to enioie blessednesse with Christ,
according to the promise: <hi>To daie shalt thou be

                  <note place="margin">Luk. 23, 43.</note> Hereof sprang that wish

                  <hi>I desire to be loosed, and to be with Christ;</hi>
and that voice in the Reuelation,<note place="margin">Reue. 14, 13.</note> 
                  <hi>Blessed are the

for theie rest from their labors, &amp; their workes
followe them.</hi> And although this blessednesse of
the soules be vnspeakeable: yet it is not abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute.
Because perfect blessednesse is of the
whole natures not of à part of man, as alreadie
we haue shewed, as at the last daie shal come
to passe, the bodies being raised. For which
purpose there is à certaine last iudgement ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
of God, in which this ful and absolute
felicitie shal be conferred vpon the Saintes.
So that the Saintes, whose bodies doe sleepe
in the duste, haue receaued alreadie single

               <p>The first robe is the verie felicitie it selfe, &amp;
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:19032:202"/>
the rest of soules in Christ. But the seconde
shal be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> immortalitie and glorie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bodies,
<hi>which shal be fashioned like vnto the glorious bodie

we shal perfectlie be blessed, ioined to God

of God, after which we at the first were
made, and afterwarde redeemed, being refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
in vs. In this image perfecte righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
perfect holinesse, perfect libertie, perfect
wisedome, perfect cleerenes and glorie shall

Which thing Salomon also doeth wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,<note place="margin">Ecclesi. 1, 8.</note>
when he saide, <hi>The eye is not satisfied

saying, Salomon doth signifie, that nothing
sufficeth man before he come vnto God, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioie
God, and blessedlie to rest in him. For
God hath ingraffed such à desire in the heart
of man, that no good thing can suffice him,
besides the soueraigne happinesse: which
hauing once attained, hee resteth therein all
blessed. So that the most perfect state of man
shal be eternal felicitie, the which we begin
here in this life, and in the life to come shall
perfectlie enioie the same. Hitherto belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
that saying of Prosper, <hi>The life to come
is thought to be blessedlie euerlasting, and euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lastinglie

blessed, where certaine securitie is, &amp; se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure

not so liuelie as the felicitie it selfe, but onelie
to stir vs to desire the same, and to make vs to
proceed in the race of godlines, vntil wee at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine

For truelie it is saide of Paule after Isaiah:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 2, 9.</note>

               <p>The thinges which eie hath not seene, neither

                  <hi>Let vs consider that no

more damnable, than through sinne to bee se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated

of blessednes to bee turned vnto moste
lothsome miserie, and from the most pleasant

               </p>
               <p>By this which hath beene saide,<note place="margin">Against the vaine opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning true happines.</note> it is to
confute the vanitie of the Philosophers, who
define mans felicitie otherwise than wee doe.
For if the true happines of man, be such à per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
state, wherein neither anie miserie maie
be feared, nor anie good thing desired, or bee
wanting, as shal be in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> euerlasting life, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into
in this world through godlines we haste<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>;
doubtles they al are much out of the waie,
which doe measure happines, and last &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
ende of man by anie thing in this world, of
what auctoritie soeuer they bee which teach
the same. For they are but dust and ashes, yea
nothing, being compared vnto that master

               <p>Epicurus the ringe-leader of Epicures,<note place="margin">Against the Epicures.</note>
                  <pb n="380" facs="tcp:19032:204"/>
doeth measure the ende of man, by à pleasant
life. For hee taught that the chiefest happines
of man was onelie the pleasure of the bodie,
which consisteth in daintie meats, and drinks,
and deligh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>s of the flesh. But who were his
maisters? Euen verie beastes. For he therefore
iudged pleasure to be the cheefest happinesse,
because beastes also for companie desired, and
followed the same. But Epicurus did nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
wiselie, neither wel in following the les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of beastes, as the Stoikes reprehended
him. For the beastes neither desire pleasure
afore all thinges, but their owne conseruation:
then pleasure as aggreeing to reason. Nowe
howe il this impure opinion of Epicurus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seemeth
man, euerie man, haue he but à meane
capacitie, maie perceaue. For what, I beseech
you, doeth so either weaken the vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
or breake the strength of the bodie, as
bodilie pleasure, if it exceede the lawes of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?
For al the powers of the bodie are quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened
by the work &amp; labor of the mind: but
through idlenesse and voluptuous delightes,
they languish. As it is verie-wel saide of one:
<hi>After the delectation of the bodie, followeth the
destruction of the flesh.</hi> Because naturalie the
companio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of pleasure, is paine. For the cause
of corruption, which is à verie paine, are sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual
delightes. And therefore both Cicero &amp;
Salomon compareth pleasure to an harlot, and
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:19032:204"/>
that fitlie. For Cicero saith, that <hi>pleasure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
vertues, is like an harlot amongest honest
matrons; for by her flatterie shee destroieth man.</hi>
And Salomon,<note place="margin">Prou. 5, 3. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>The lipps of à strange woman drop
as an honie combe, and her mouth is more softe
than oile: but the end of her is bitter as worme-worde.</hi>
For as Bees doe firste giue honie, and
foorthwith pricke with their sting: so bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
pleasure (of which the Epicurs make three
sortes, namelie to feede delicatelie, to drinke
pleasantlie, and to liue lecherouslie, the rest
seruing herevnto, whether they delight the
eies, or please the eares, or prouoke the bodie
by what meanes soeuer vnto pleasure they
cal appurtenaunces) beareth à show of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
while it ticleth the mind by her entice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes,
but in the ende it bringeth moste
bitter sorrowe. Because not onelie the worde
of God condemneth the pleasure of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
as hurtful to the soule; but also the verie
Philosophers too of the wiser kinde.<note place="margin">Antisthenes Critolaus.</note> For An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisthenes
called bodilie pleasure, extreme mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serie.
Critolaus the Peripatetion did not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
cal it extreeme miserie, but saide moreouer
that it was the cause and spring of al euils. Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitas
the Tarentine,<note place="margin">Architas Tare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinus.</note> as Cicero doth report,
saith there is none more deadlie à pestilence
giuen of nature to man, than is the pleasure
of the bodie. For pleasure flaieth counsel, is
an enimie to reason, dazeleth the sight of
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:19032:205"/>
the minde;<note place="margin">Aristotle.</note> and hath no dealing at al with vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.
And Aristotle, did saie, that bodilie
pleasure agreeth to beastes rather then to
men.</p>
               <p>The reasons which the familie of Epicures
hath to confirme the blessednes of man to be
pleasure, are foolish and ridiculous to those,
who know that the end &amp; perfect state of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is to be considered in those things which
make nature perfect, not in those things which
destroie nature. Let vs therefore sende-back
the Epicure to the hogs his masters, or vnto
Penelopes her woers, of whom it seemeth he
learned his philosophie; and let vs beare in
minde the saieng of Iesus the sonne of Sirach;
<hi>He that resisteth pleasure, prolongeth his life.</hi>

               <p>Pindarus capitane of the Lyrikes,<note place="margin">2. Against the opinion of Pinda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus.</note> to currie
fauour with his princes, did thus define the
felicitie of man: <hi>Let him knowe that he is hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie
in the sight of God, who hath glorie with goods.
For that is the onelie happines of man.</hi> But for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch
as riches are outwarde thinges and
glorie is vane, and subiect, oftentimes to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration,
who, I praie you, can bee blessed
thereby: especialie seeing hee is not hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie,
but miserable, whiche feareth anie e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill?</p>
               <p>The Poe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Simonides saith,<note place="margin">3. Against the opinion of Simoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des.</note> the best thing
that man can haue, is he health; the next to that,
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:19032:205"/>
is to bee well fauoured; and the nexte to
that, to gette riches by good meanes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
fraude. This fellowe also followeth
the counsell of his senses, not of reason.
Nowe that such à man is not blessed, it is
manifest by this, that hee is subiecte to the
mutabilitie of fortune, of whome also he stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
in feare.</p>
               <p>Aristotle the chiefe among the Peripa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tetikes,<note place="margin">4. Against the opinion of Aristotle.</note>
had the people, euen the greate Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron
of error, and the peruerse interpreter
of the trueth, for his master. Hee with the
Stoikes doeth well condemne the filthie plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of Epicurus, as more meete for à beast
than for anie man: but hee seeketh with the
wiser men of the multitude, two other
kindes of good thinges; wherein erroneous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
hee doeth place the blessednesse of man.
The one hee calleth ciuil, the other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templatiue.
To these hee annexeth the three
sortes of good thinges, to witte, of the
minde, of the bodie, and externall. Both
his Ciuilian and Contemplator, hee saith,
stande in neede of these thinges, but the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilian
more, and the other lesse. Secondlie
hee placeth the blessednesse of the ciuile
man in vertue; &amp; of the contemplator in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation,
that is in the deepe action of the
minde.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="384" facs="tcp:19032:206"/>
But each felicitie, as he saith, is by prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
bewtified &amp; encreased; &amp; by aduersitie
obscured, &amp; diminished, and oftentimes defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
vtterlie.</p>
               <p>The Stoikes with weightie arguments did
shake this opinion of Aristotle, both for cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
them good thinges, which were not, and

outwarde thinges, which come not nigh
the mind, cannot alter the minde: but the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
minde as of externall thinges he hath set-downe.
But to bee briefe; seeing Aristotles
felicitie is contrarie to our religion, yea and
to reason also, who maie embrace the same as
true? What vertue, I pray you, is perfect with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
godlinesse? What contemplation but is
erroneous, if it haue not the light of Gods hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenlie

as Cicero doth saie, <hi>If à blessed life maie bee lost,
it cannot bee blessed.</hi> Whoso feareth alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

consider more aduisedlie what kinde of
happinesse it is which hee promiseth to his

doe place their chiefest happines, to wit, in
the multitude of children, in aboundance of
riches, in the health of the bodie, in sumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
buildinges, and to bee famous in the

à ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> happie. But because such as abound with
these thinges, doe hange betweene hope and
feare, they are in verie deed moste miserable.
For they doe alwaies feare least some euil doe
happen, and fortune change her face. And
therefore miserable, as I maie saie, is their
blessednesse, which is subiecte to so manie
chances, and whose ende is endles miserie;
as the Psalmes 37. and 73. doe teach. The
vanitie of all these, wee maie ouerthrowe eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
by this onelie argument. Nothing is so great,
or so heaped-together in this life, that it can
suffice him, which desireth more, according
to that of Seneca: <hi>Fortune hath giuen much to
manie men, but enough to none.</hi> Wallowe thou
in pleasures, exceede in banquetting excell
thou Sardanapalus, passe Epicurus, yet thine
vncleane mind wil continualie wish-for som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what

sought, which thou must ouercome. In all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thinges either wee attaine not so much as
wee woulde, because our desire is vnsatiable;
or wee repent that wee haue our wishe; and
when man hath best fortune, then common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
either some woefull chaunce, or à gnaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

<hi>The natural desire of man, is not vane. But all
men naturalie desire to be happie. Therefore this
desire is not vane. But none come vnto this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines
in this life. For in this life nothing maketh

               </p>

to whose mind, Plato his scholer, doth
call the true happines sometime the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation
of the beste, as the waie vnto blisse;
sometime he maketh the loue and imitation
of God the ende of man, or chiefe selicitie,
as that wherein the soueraigne blisse of man
doeth consist. And although Socrates &amp; Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

of God, who by his worde sheweth
vs the readie waie, both vnto the knowledge
of true happines, and also vnto the endles en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioieng

word of God sheweth that onelie pearle, that
soueraigne blisse wherein the minde of man
doth rest: the sweetnes whereof whoso once
hath tasted (for euen in this life also it is also
tasted, though not vnto satietie) he forthwith
begins to abhor al those things, which the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable

But wherefore blessed? Because they haue

For such is the goodnes and mercie of God,

               <p>And forsomuch as this house of God,<note place="margin">How God is serued in his Church.</note> is

God gaue it them, who alwaie worketh

armed with the power of GOD, theie
entered battaile with the worlde. And

therefore Paul saith:<note place="margin">2. Cor. 10, 4.</note>

                  <hi>and bringing into captiuitie e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie

of the Gospel armed with this courage,
do preuaile against the gates of hel. For which

of the infallible hope, which both theie haue
themselues, and shewe to others. This cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
GOD in al ages endueth his ministers

when he saith: <hi>Receaue the holie Ghoste.

Therefore the holie Ghost is that fortitude,
wherebie the ministers of the worde, are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boldened

both maketh the mindes of teachers couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,

the spirite doth giue witnes that the doctrine
of the Gospel is not forged, but from God
himselfe. For it is à great miracle, that the

               <p>Againe, the question maie be aunswered;
that al preachers which teach the word right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
haue the holie Ghost, but not al alike. For

theie haue the holie spirite, as à teacher,

the holie spirite. That holie man of God

Peter had the holie spirite,<note place="margin">Peter.</note> both of teaching

               <p>Moreouer,<note place="margin">Ministers how called.</note> as touching the spirite of tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching,
it is to be noted, that as there is à two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folde
calling by meanes, and without meanes:
So there is à twofolde probation of the spirite
of instruction. For, if the calling be with-out
meanes, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is, by God himselfe, &amp; Iesus Christ,
and not by men after the ordinarie manner, as
was the calling of the Prophets, and Apostles,
the spirite of instruction, without al doubt is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
holie Ghost himselfe, whose doctrine, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he
is true, is also true, firme, and heauenlie, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
al mixture of errors: it hath also heauenlie
miracles, wherebie the trueth of the doctrine
is confirmed. But if the calling be by meanes,
then are the spirites to be tried, whether theie
are of God, and so farre-forth the holie spirite
is to be acknowledged for the teacher, as what
is taught is agreeable to the worde receaued
from the Prophetes, from Christ, and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles.

               </p>
               <p>The second is an obseruation,<note place="margin">Obseruation</note> and collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the principal pointes of heauenlie do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
without which the paines in reading is
to smal purpose. For, as in al artes this care is
necessarie to him that would be substantialie
learned: so litle shal he profite in the sacred
Scripture, which obserueth not the chiefe
heads of religion; neither bringeth al that he
readeth vnto some special common place.</p>
               <p>The thirde is à diligent regard vnto com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
axioms, &amp; sentences, which are as gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
rules, ministring iudgement in doubtful
causes; as Rhetoricia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of general thesees, which
therefore theie call consultations, do iudge of
particulars, and causes in controuersie. Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
maketh obseruation of examples, from
which the determinations of matters in doubt
are fetched oftentimes.</p>
               <p>The fourth is à sure reteining of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
in minde, that when occasion serueth,
theie maie be drawen out of the treasurehouse
of memorie.</p>
               <p>The fift is contemplation, wherebie as it
were at the first sight of the minde, we behold
the whole course of the Scripture. By this we
compare thinges like, and vnlike together; by
this we reconcile contrarie places; and by this
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:19032:215"/>
we seeke definitions, diuisions, distinctions, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations
of obscure places, yea and make
à constitution of the bodie of doctrine.</p>
               <p>The sixt is tradition of elders.<note place="margin">Tradition.</note> This decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
what the holie fathers haue thought of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie
thing. This tradition, if it be confirmed
by the worde of GOD, is of authoritie and
weight. In which respecte wee faithfullie im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
at this daie the Creede, both of the Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cene
councel, of Athanasius, of Ambrose, and
that which is caled the Apostles Creede, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
theie are euident groundes gathered out
of God his worde. But if the tradition be not
proued out of the word of God, then is it, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
contrarie to the worde, and therefore we
abhorre the same, as the voice of the serpent
that seduced Euah; or it is beside the worde,
and we receaue it, in respect of such as deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the same out, vntil it be drawen into an
euil conclusion by the enimies of true do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
               <p>With this knowledge of the heauenlie do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
there should be ioyned,<note place="margin">2. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond thing required in ministers, &amp; preachers of the Gospel.</note> as in al men, so
especialie in the ministers of the Gospel, á
liuelie feeling in the heart; without which,
knowledge doth not profite, but hurt rather,
through the fault of man.<note place="margin">Feeling of the heart.</note> This liuelie sense
proceedeth from faith, and other motions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing
to the Lawe of God, which the holie
spirite stirreth-vp in the heartes of beleeuers.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="404" facs="tcp:19032:216"/>
And this sense is called the path-waie of
God, because as God requireth the same: so
through it we approch, and are ioined vnto
God. And therefore Paule requireth these
two thinges, namelie knowledge, and feeling
together,<note place="margin">Phil. 1, 9.</note> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he thus writeth: <hi>This I praie you,
that your loue maie abound yet more and more in

                  <note place="margin">10.</note> 
                  <hi>and in al iudgement, that ye maie dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
thinges that differ,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">11.</note> 
                  <hi>that ye maie be pure, and
without offence, vntil the daie of Christ, filled with

Christ vnto the glorie,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ende of knowledge.</note> 
                  <hi>and praise of God.</hi> So that
the end of knowledge is, that we should iudge
proue, and approue those thinges, which are
the better, and most profitable. To feeling
is subiect synceritie, which is à good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science
before God, innocencie of life, that we offend
no man, and plentie of fruits of the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of faith, which proceede from the grace of
Iesus Christ, and tend vnto the laude &amp; praise
of God.</p>
               <p>If this liuelie sense with the knowledge of
heauenlie doctrine be not in the teachers of
the Churche,<note place="margin">State of wicked mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisteri.</note> nothing is more cursed in the
whole worlde than theie are. For when
they reproue other me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for sinning, theie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
themselues; when theie lift vp others
with comfort, theie ouer-throwe themselues;
when theie teach others, themselues are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded;
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:19032:216"/>
to be short, whatsoeuer theie doe in
the ministerie, committed to their charge, it
is à testimonie to their owne damnation. For
theie are verie-like the makers of Noahs arke.
For as theie, when the arke was builded, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
Noah, and his familie was saued, perished in
the floud: so these men, shal perish in the
floud of hel fire, when such as gaue credite vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the worde theie preached, shal be saued.
Wherefore let both them, which are in the
ministerie, and them also which purpose to
enter into the same, consider, howe grieuous,
the punishment is, that hangeth-ouer their
heades, if the feeling in the heart, and their life
answere not to their doctrine: againe, what
great glorie is laide-vp for them, if theie doe
builde the Church of Christ with both hands,
namelie with doctrine, and with example. Of
whiche glorie afterwarde we wil entreate.</p>
               <p>Moreouer the teachers of the Churche
ought to shewe the waie of the Lord to men
that goe astraie.<note place="margin">3. The third thing requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the ministers of the Gospel.</note> For which cause theie are
called the guides of the flocke in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
that going-before them both in lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and life, theie maie both prepare the
waie, and animate others to followe them.
And therefore in the prophesie of Isaiah, it is
written:<note place="margin">Isai. 62, 10.</note> 
                  <hi>Go-through, goe-through the gates, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare

of the worde vnderstand, that as theie ought
to goe before other men, both by example of
good life, and sound preaching: so theie must
first before others come into peril. For which

went vp to Hierusalem for to sacrifice, with

that in time to come, were to set-foorth the

As y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people of God through the drie valleis,

greatlie Paule was persecuted, that he maie be

of the seconde Epistle vnto the Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.
Wherefore let the ministers of the gospel
vnderstand, howe theie are called not vnto
pleasures and banqueting, but to suffer great
conflictes, and moste certaine perils; and the
more secure that theie seeme, the nigher theie
are to the snares. For the diuel is an enimie to

the crosse belonging to the ministers of the

endes;<note place="margin">The crosse what it sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth.</note> and also annexe consolations, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies

But in the Church wee speake especialie
of the spiritual. Which is defined to be à crosse
which is taken, and enioined for the washing
awaie the eternall punishment, and sinnes of

&amp; endured. For he taking our cause vpon him
selfe, suffered punishment, not for his owne,
but for our offences, that he might be impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

fault due; that is for a price of redemption;
that the faithful might no more bee counted

Here Dauid in his owne person depainteth
the affections and sorowes of those men, who
in equal balance do weigh thy sinnes.<note place="margin">Howe godlie men doe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> esteeme of their sinnes.</note> For they
conceiue not of their sinnes, as hypocrites and
Atheistes doe, according to their owne iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and fleshlie imagination: but rather ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the maiestie of God that is offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;
to the filthines of sinne; and to the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
which they doe deserue by the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of the lawe. And although worldlie
men seldome haue such motions in their mind
as Dauid and Ezekiah had: yet it is necessarie,
that hee who is iustlie punished for offences
perpetrated, be touched with true sorow for
his sinne without hypocrisie.<note place="margin">Contrition meritorious with the Papistes.</note> But here an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
of the Papistes is to bee taken heed off,
who teach that such a sorowe conceaued for
sinne, doeth merite forgiuenes at the handes
of God. For although this sorow doe go-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the petition of forgiuenesse: yet it is not
the cause of mercie and forgiuenes. But who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
persisteth in weighing his sinne &amp; his pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
together, and procedeth no further,
shall be swalowed vp of desperation, as Cain,
Saul, Iudas, and manie others were.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="414" facs="tcp:19032:221"/>
Thirdlie, in God he must honor his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and his mercie. Of the righteous iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God, it is, that sinnes are punished in
al men: &amp; of his mercie, that they are puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed,
not to their vtter destruction, but for
their saluation, if they despise not the salue.
Vnto his iudgement it belongeth by degrees
of punishment to correct sinneful man, vntill
he come to the last. And, forsomuch as hee
professeth himself to be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Physition of soules,
he doth as it were imitate skilfull Physitions,
who in curing doe vse certaine degrees. Firste
they beginne with gentler sortes of salues: and
if they doe little good, they laie sharper re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies
vnto the wound. And as Hypocrates
doeth saie: <hi>The diseases which medicines do not
heale, the iron doeth heale; those which the iron
healeth not, the fire doeth heale; but such as the
fire doth not heale, theie, of my word are incurable:</hi>
So God doth sometime reproue mans wicked<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes,
by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word; if y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doth not help, he correcteth
with sicknes, infamie, &amp; imprisoment; if they
profit not, he inflameth the fire of his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the mindes of men, and maketh them
agast with the terror of euerlasting torments;
if neither that can heale their cancre, hee lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
them quite as incurable, and giueth them
ouer into à reprobate minde, so that they haue
neither à righte iudgement to discerne
thinges, nor anie sorowe at all, by reason of
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:19032:221"/>
the filth of wickednes, wherein they wallow.
To bee short, God of his iudgement doeth
punish that through his mercie,<note place="margin">Isai. 28, 21.</note> he maie saue:
This is it which Isaiah doth saie: <hi>Hee doeth à
straunge worke, that he maie doe his owne,</hi> that is,
he doeth kill and slaie, that hee maie quicken
and salue. This iudgement and this mercie of
God, are ioined-together of Dauid so often as
he lamenteth his sins, as maie appeare both in
51. &amp; also in sundrie other psalms, but especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alie
in those which are called penitential Psal.</p>
               <p>Last of all, in the Gospell hee must seeke
for counsell, and for comfort. The thiefe whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
hong on the right hand of Christ, confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
his offence and miserie; sawe the falsehood
and crueltie of Satan; had the iudgement of
God also in great reuerence. For being on the
crosse,<note place="margin">Luk. 4, 23.</note> he spake these wordes: <hi>Wee receaue
thinges worthie of that wee haue done.</hi> Beside he
praised the mercie of God fleing vnto Christ,
whome before his eies he sawe embrued with
bloode, and defiled with the spittle of the sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers:
whome notwithstanding he confessed
to be the Physition &amp; Sauior of the world; &amp;
so through beleefe on him was deliuered from
the sicknes of his soule, though not from the
punishment of his bodie. Notwithstanding
hee hearde his comfortable voice, <hi>To daie
thou shalt bee with mee in Paradise.</hi> In like
manner those which with the theife in
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:19032:222" rendition="simple:additions"/>
their deserued paines and affliction do return
vnto Christ, be receaued and healed, although
their sinnes are infinite, and their offences in
quantitie passe the sande of the sea, as Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasses
confessed that his sinnes did. For, as
the mercie of God in Christ is endles, and à
ransome of infinite, and vnestimable price:
So the Physition Christ, who affirmeth that
he <hi>came to saue that was lost,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 18, 11</note> doeth offer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
into all men indifferentlie, and without
respecte vnto anie calleth al men vnto repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.<note place="margin">Mat. 11, 28.</note>
For so he saith: <hi>Come vnto me all ye that
are wearie and laden, and I wil ease you.</hi> Heere he
calleth al that labor, and be loaden albeit with
infinite sinnes; he excludeth none, but admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
al vnto repentance; and ministreth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie
to such as come vnder his handes, and
craue his helpe with the theefe. For first hee
remoueth awaie the cause of affliction, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
sinne, when man at the voice of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
repenteth; when he besprincleth the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
of the penitent with his blood, and
washeth it from deade workes; and withal im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puteth
his righteousnes to the penitent, that
by the same, he maie appeare righteous in the
sight of God, although before man he beareth
the punishment of sinne.</p>
               <p>Beside with inwarde consolation by his
spirite he mittigateth present affliction, &amp; gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
strength to beare y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deserued punishment
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:19032:222" rendition="simple:additions"/>
with à quiet minde. And although the crosse
seeme in mans eies an odious thing; yet is it
(yea, though it be deserued) à sacrifice high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
pleasing God; as we maie see in Dauid, and
in the thiefe. The thiefe was punished for his
enormous wickednes: Dauid suffereth afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for adulterie and murther which hee had
committed. Notwithstanding both the crosse
of that thiefe from the crosse of the other
thiefe hanging on the left-side of Christ; and
the affliction of Dauid from the punishment
of Saule, differed in respecte of their sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and repentant heartes: which beeing
laide vppon the crosse of Christe as vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon

enimies consume Christians, although they were

rather as after trees be hewen-downe, much moe

               <p>And although the verie feare of GOD

               <p>But in à Martyr I require these thinges
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:19032:225"/>
in order. The firste is à firme knowledge,
and demonstration of the doctrine of the
Church: the seconde, a liuelie faith in Christ:
the thirde, a constant confession and defence
of the doctrine: the fourth, courage of mind
to beare the crosse: the fifth, obedience or
patience vnder the crosse: the sixte, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincible
hope: the seauenth, inuocation of
GOD, to which together with the cause he
shoulde commende his soule. All which are
euident in Stephan the Proto-martyr.<note place="margin">Acts. 7, 55. 56, &amp;c.</note> 
                  <hi>For
neither,</hi> as Augustine saith, <hi>can they haue the
life of Martyrs,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Who suffer as Martyrs.</note> 
                  <hi>who haue not the liues of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians;
seeing it is not the punishment, but the
cause that maketh à Martyr.</hi> Wherefore the
punishment of Anabaptistes, and other ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate
heretikes, is not martyrdome, but a
iust punishment due to them by God and the
lawes. Manie fanatical heads indeede approch
without feare vnto the tormentes, but it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they are deluded by Sathan, who ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoreth
by their paines to confirme erroneous
opinions vnto the destruction of the Church.
And therefore let vs duelie consider the cause,
whie we suffer martyrdome, least through the
delusio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> diuel we be bewitched: for to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
persecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to be in prison, to be whipped,
to be kept fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> libertie, to be killed is no praise:
but this is praiseworthie, to haue a good cause.
For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> praise consisteth in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> goodnes of cause,
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:19032:226"/>
not in the bitternesse of punishment. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
would I haue anie man for some cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
opinion not contrarie to the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of religion, to bring himselfe into danger,
especialie if the iudgementes of the godlie
which agree-together in the grounde, are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse,
which notwithstanding maie stande
without shaking the foundation, I meane the
article of faith.</p>
               <p>Heere happilie some enquirer of the
iudgementes of GOD,<note place="margin">Whie God suffereth his Saints to be martyred.</note> maie demaunde,
howe it commeth to passe, that God beeing
most righteous, can suffer his sainctes, whome
most entirelie hee doeth loue, to bee torne
after such an horrible sorte, and to be mang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
and deformed with such contumelies;
and that of Sathan and his members? Heere
wee must open the eie not of reason, but of
faith; not the sense of fleshe, but of the spirit
must be consulted withal, that we maie clere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
beholde the trueth, and knowe that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
commeth to the Sainctes of God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
his prouidence, vnder the shadow where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
they are couered. I confesse indeede it is
à trim sight for the Diuel to see Abel murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of his owne brother; Daniel cast into the
Lyons denne; Iob spoiled of his goodes, and
replenished with botches; Steuen to bee sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned;
yea and all the sainctes with tormentes
and shame, to bee executed to death:
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:19032:226" rendition="simple:additions"/>
But I confesse too, that in the eies of God
<hi>(who testifieth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psa. 116, 15</note> 
                  <hi>that in his sight the death of his
Saintes is pretious)</hi> it is à much more goodlie
sight; yet not of it selfe, but in respect of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent.
And therefore both God and the diuel
also wil the punishment of the saintes, but not
both alike, but with à diuers affection, and
purpose. For God of mercie suffereth his
Saintes to be afflicted; but the diuel persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
them of malice: God, that theie maie be
crowned; the diuel, that theie maie be confou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded:
God, as à Father; the diuel, as à tyran, and
hangman; God, for his owne glorie; the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel,
to his owne confusion. Of these causes Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine
speaketh on this wise: <hi>Euerie wicked
man in himselfe hath à will to hurt, but yet hath
no power in himselfe that he maie hurte, that he
would he is now accused, that he maie through the
secrete dispensation of God, he is giuen to one to be
punished, to another to be proued, to another to be
crowned. To be punished the Israelites were deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered
into the handes of strangers, because theie
had sinned against God. To be proued, Iob was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered
to Satan: And Iob was proued: but Satan
put vnto shame: To be crowned the Martyrs were
tormented of bloudie persecutors. And therefore
à great deale more happie are the martyrs in their
torments, than the moste mightie monarches in
their delitiousnes, riches, honour, and pleasures.</hi>
Which thing Augustine also doth witnesse,
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:19032:227"/>
when he saith: <hi>The men of this world are vnhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilie
happie: but the Martyrs were happilie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happie.
For theie were vnhappie for à time,
but theie are happie for euer.</hi> According
to the worde of the LORDE:<note place="margin">Math. 5, 10</note> 
                  <hi>Blessed
are theie which suffer persecution for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes
sake.</hi> This successe of the Martyrs is
notablie described by the Psalmist in these
words:<note place="margin">Psal. 126, 5 6.</note> 
                  <hi>Theie that doe sowe in teares, shall reape
in ioie. Theie went weeping and carried pretious
seede: but theie shal returne with ioie, and bring
their sheaues.</hi> And hence it is that the holie
Martyrs of God doe cast their eies and their
minde, not vnto the time of sowing, and to
the purpose of Sathan, that would vtterlie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerwhelme
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church of God in the streames
of blood, but especiallie vnto the most ioieful
time, when the sheaues shalbee gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with gladnes, and vnto the reuerend
prouidence of God who after this maner by
his wise counsel wil haue his saintes to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised
in this life, that theie maie be like his
sonne, both in the crosse, &amp; in glorie. Whence
it is that the holie Martyrs of God doe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
them-selues in the middes of tormentes.
For theie knowe,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 4, 17.</note> 
                  <hi>That light affliction which is
but for à moment, causeth vnto them à farre more

as it is in the Epistle vnto the Hebrues; <hi>Chasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing

                  <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioice,
in asmuch as ye are partakers of Christes suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings,
that when his glorie shal appeare, ye maie
be glad and reioice.</hi> By the remembrance of this

against the offence of the crosse, &amp; think-vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
à ioiful euent, to wit, howe theie who in this

to come be eternalie blessed with Christ. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore
it maie be asked with what seruice
are y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> martyrs to be worshipped, especialie for
so much as we see temples to be erected, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the names of martyrs, and of others are pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
and festiual daies ordained in their honor,
&amp; worship? Vnto this question out of Cyril,
where he refelled the slaunders of Iulian, I doe
thus answere: <hi>We doe saie how the holie martyrs
be no Gods; neither haue we vsed to worship them.
But we praise them with great honor, for so much
as valiantlie theie haue foughten for the truth, and
kept the synceritie of the faith.</hi> And Augustine:
<hi>The examples of the saintes are not set before vs,
that we should of them be iustified, but that follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their foote-steps we maie knowe, how he hath
iustified vs, who iustified them.</hi> Therefore
if either temples be erected vnder the names
of Martyrs, or Feastes bee instituted in
their momorie, I mislike it not, so it be done
not for worshippe sake, but onelie to
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:19032:228"/>
retaine them<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>in remembrance, and to recite
their actes, that others maie both thanke God
for their constancie, and imitate their exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
if anie occasion shal seeme to require the
same. The thinges which Monkes doe tell
of martyrs, are but meere fables and illusions;
As that Martyrs at the houre of their martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
haue begged of God, that so manie as
beare their passions in memorie, and worship
them vpon fasting, and ember daies, maie be
deliuered from certaine diseases. Which their
lies are so abhominable, as nothing can be
more. For did the holie martyrs make such a
request, theie were extreame blasphemers of
God his holie Name.</p>
               <p>Besides the Papistes doe faigne howe the
martyrs of God for three causes are to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped.<note place="margin">Martyrs are not to be worshipped.</note>
The first whereof is the neede we
stand in; the second, the glorie of the martyrs;
the thirde, the reuerence of God. But al these
rotten reasons are ouerthrown, as it were with
a thunder-bolt from heauen, by this saieng of
the Lord:<note place="margin">Mat. 4, 10.</note> 
                  <hi>Thou shalt worship the Lorde thie God,
and him onelie shalt thou serue.</hi> If then necessitie
doe presse thee downe, followe the example
of Dauid:<note place="margin">Psal. 121, 2.</note> who saith, <hi>Mine helpe commeth from
the Lord, which hath made the heauen, and the
earth.</hi> For that is the commandement of the
Lord,<note place="margin">Psal. 50, 15.</note> 
                  <hi>Call-vpon mee in the daie of trouble.</hi> And
the truth it selfe doeth saie:<note place="margin">Iohn. 16, 23.</note> 
                  <hi>Whatsoeuer yee
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:19032:228"/>
shal aske the father in my Name; he wil giue it you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And whereas theie saie, the glorie of
Saints is more knowen through calling-vpon
them, to witte while we obtaine that which
we aske by the helpe of them, that is open
blasphemie, and reproch against the sonne of
God, yea and most filthie idolatrie, which all
the saintes do abhorre.</p>
               <p>Neither is that of greater force, that theie
saie, the reuerence toward God doth require,
that a sinner who hath offended God, should
not approch vnto God himselfe without a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron,
As though that patron did not suffice,
whome we haue in heauen,<note place="margin">1. Iohn 2, 1.</note> euen Iesus Christe
the righteous. <hi>If anie man sinne,</hi> saith Iohn, <hi>we
haue an aduocate with the Father, Iesus Christ,
the iust.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                  <hi>And he is the reconciliation for our
sinnes: and not for ours onelie, but also for the sinne
of the whole world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore the Papistes doe both de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue,
and are deceaued of Satan, who hath
brought the worship of Saints into the world,
euen vtterlie to abolish, or at the least to ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish
the office of our onelie Mediator Iesus
Christ; to make the Saintes infamous; and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nallie,
that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> idolatrous worshippers of Saints
maie be partakers of his eternal tormentes.</p>
               <p>So then omitting fables, and delusions of
the diuel, let vs imitate the examples of the
saintes in al their wel-doing; and prepare we
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:19032:229"/>
our selues to enter into troubles for the truth
of God, so long as we goe on warfare vpon
this earth. And that this is the true vse of the

               <p>THis fourth member touching the teachers
of the Church, is an allegorical image of
the ministers of the worde. This pleasant al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legorie
doeth admonish vs of manie thinges.
First it sendeth vs vnto the verie fountaine,<note place="margin">God à wel, and in what sense.</note>
namelie vnto God himselfe. And God is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
á well, both because he hath al good things

                  <hi>My soule thirsteth for God, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen

two euils:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ierem. 2, 13.</note> 
                  <hi>they haue forsaken mee the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane

broken pittes that can holde no water.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iohn. 4, 10. 14.</note> And the
Lorde in the Gospel calleth himselfe <hi>à Well.</hi>
The water issuing from this fountane,<note place="margin">The water of God, what; Ioel. 2, 28.</note> is both
the gift of the holie ghost; Therefore saith the
Prophet: <hi>I wil powre-out my spirit vpon all flesh;</hi>
and also the doctrine of the Gospel, or the
promise of Christ. These are wholesome wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
indeede, wherewithall the hot, and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
consciences are cooled. And y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doctrine
puffeth not vp, but is spiritual, and withal coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
the heart from the lustes of the worlde, &amp;
inflameth with the loue of GOD. Which
wholesome waters Peter calleth the wordes of
eternal life,<note place="margin">Iohn. 6, 68.</note> when he saith: <hi>Master, to whome
shal wee goe? Thou hast the wordes of eternal life.</hi>
Therefore in the Reuelation Christ saith:<note place="margin">Reuel. 21, 6.</note> 
                  <hi>I wil
giue to him that is à thirst, of the wel of the water
of life freelie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as this liuing water is offered through
the preaching of the Gospel:<note place="margin">The water of life howe receaued.</note> so by faith it is
drawen, and taken, according to the wordes of
the Lorde:<note place="margin">Iohn. 6, 35.</note> 
                  <hi>He that beleeueth in me, shal neuer

<hi>With ioie shall yee drawe waters out of the wels of

and bee filled. Because no man, as Bernard
saith, <hi>is cleane from filth, all men haue neede of
the well of mercie, and with à like desire shoulde
hasten vnto this well with Noah, Daniel, &amp; Iob.</hi>
And the Lorde saith, <hi>Whosoeuer drinketh of the
water that I shal giue him,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iohn. 4, 14.</note> 
                  <hi>shall neuer be more à

                  <note place="margin">Zach. 14 8.</note>
that is the preaching of the Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
doctrine, which hauing proceeded from
Iudea, and Ierusalem, shall bee sowed after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde

               <p>Thirdlie it calleth vs back from puddles,

doctrine is, how the ministerie of the worde

Isaiah speaketh on this wise:<note place="margin">Isai. 55, 10.</note> 
                  <hi>As the raine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth

thing whereto I sent it.</hi> As if he saide, The worde
of promise, which at my commandement ye
are to preach, shal euermore be of force. For as
the raine which at my bidding watereth the
earth, and maketh it fruiteful, so that of á litle
seede the husbandmen gather such an haruest,
that not onlie, theie feede their owne familie
therewithal but also haue sufficient seede for
the yeare ensuing: so also shal the seede of my

               </q>
               <p>He signifieth how the teachers of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church
shall not want enimies, whome notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
they shall ouercome through the power
of GOD, wherewith they are strengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
               <p>Moreouer the enimies with whome the
souldiers of the Church,<note place="margin">Enimies of the Church who.</note> that is, the preachers
of the worde do encounter, they are the diuel
and his garde, tyrantes, sophisters, hypocrits,
and Epicures. Against these enimies the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
of the Gospell enter into the feelde be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
armed with spirituall armor; of which ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor
wee haue alreadie spoken<note n="*" place="margin">In the first parte, Chap. 3. Page. 18. 19.</note>. The Diuel
he laieth snares both for the doctrine, and for
the life of the ministers of the worde, that by
either,<note place="margin">Purpose of Satan.</note> or by both, he maie ouerthrowe vs. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
this enimie we are to fight by synceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of doctrine, by innocencie of life, and by
ardent calling-vppon the Lorde of hoastes.
<hi>Submit your selues to God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 4, 7.</note> saith Iames, <hi>resist the
diuel, and he wil flie from you.</hi> And as he is obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:19032:233"/>
to GOD which giueth credite to his
worde, and liueth according vnto the same:
So hee resisteth the Diuel, inuading the
worde and the life, who retaineth synceritie
of doctrine, liueth innocentlie, and calleth
earnestlie vppon GOD. But when this
thadgeth not well with him, that is, when
hee is not able either to corrupte the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
or to marre the life, hee flieth, and
confesseth himselfe to bee ouercome. And,
because hee is much more mightier than
man is, this promise is deepelie to be engra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
in the heart, <hi>And he will flie from you,</hi> that
is, nothing will hurt you, he shall not ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe
you by his subtilties, so longe as yee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide
grounded vpon faith.<note place="margin">1. Iohn. 5, 4.</note> 
                  <hi>For faith is the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie
of the world,</hi> that is of the diuel and of al
his warriers.</p>
               <p>But for somuch as there is perpetual warre
betweene Satan and the Church of Christ, we
ought then especialie to be in armes, when he
seemeth to flie awaie. For he flieth not as one
without al hope of anie buckling againe, but
that after an other waie he maie returne out of
his ambushes with greater force. For as he is
vnconstant and craftie, and of greate experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:
so hee setteth vppon the ministers of
the Gospell nowe this waie, and then
an other waie, and therebie sometime hee
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:19032:234"/>
he maketh great slaughter, as maie appeare
in heretikes of al ages, among whome there
haue ben manie verie learned, &amp; godlie men,
but being snarled and vtterlie blinded with
the nets of Satan, and arguments of blind rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
theie haue yeelded. And therefore the
souldiers of God, and guiders of the Church
of Christ, wil stand in the fore-fronte against
the diuel, vnder the banner of Christ, keeping
faith and à good conscience by all maner prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
and supplications, praieng alwaies in the
spirite, and in watching therin with al earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
that vtterance maie be giuen to them in
the opening of their mouth with boldenesse,
that theie maie make the mysterie of God to

               <p>For as their better part, to wit, the minde is

                  <hi>But I shall be like à greene oliue tree in the

On the otherside both Christ, and Paul,
yea and infinite Martyrs and doctors of the

               <p>The contrarietie of these sayinges, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
maie easilie be reconciled, if we marke
the causes wel. He that by fleeing seeketh his
owne, and not the things which are Christes,
is much to blame. Contrariewise, he that by
flieng seeketh the glorie of God, and not his
owne co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie, offendeth not. And therfore
saith Augustine: <hi>The seruant of God sinneth not,
though seeing the rage of tyrantes, greedelie bent
to destroie his soule, he changeth his aboade, if so
be that he commend his flocke to the hie shepherde

I answerere, when thou art in the hands

distinction of Augustine is to be had in mind:<note place="margin">Au. Ep. 180.</note>
                  <hi>When persecution is hoat, the ministers of Christe
are to flie, if so be that either there is no congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
where they are, or if there bee, when there
be ministers enough to fulfil the ministerie, which
haue not such cause to flie. But when the people
shal abide, and all the ministers flie awaie, what
else doe they showe themselues, but euen cursed
hirelings without all care of the sheepe?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But if Tyrantes doe persecute without all
respect all the ministers of the gospel, &amp; spare
the common people, what is then to be done?
Hereunto Augustine doeth answere,</hi> That ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
made earnest prayer vnto God, they are by
lot to chuse who shal flee, and who shal tarie. For
in so doing both good regard is had for the present
state of the Church, and also it is wel prouided, that
when the teachers of the Church be once killed, it
shall want no ministers for all that to instructe
them.</p>
               <p>Sophisters and Sycophantes being puffed-vp

The scope of whome is, that the

depraued with humane, or diuelishe deuises,
the Church, whose life is the puritie of Gods

               <p>Thirdlie, they are to eschewe all vnproper

<pb n="445" facs="tcp:19032:236"/>
Finalie, if so instructed, they are not yet able

the words, that he had nothing to saie, but only this
that he did thinke so, &amp; that there was none other

old man: If thou beleeuest these things to be so, said
he, arise and folow me vnto Demonicus, &amp; receaue

This proposition of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> praier is vpholde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with
two reasons, the former whereof goeth-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
the other followeth the proposition. For
petitions are not wont to bee proponed sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie,
and nakedlie, but most commonlie they
are adorned with argumentes of persuasion,
often they are set out with epithetes applied
to the thinge which is asked, the more to
moue.</p>
               <p>The former reason,<note place="margin">1. Reason.</note> is contained in these
wordes, <hi>O Lord God of hoastes,</hi> and it is taken
from the power of God, as if hee saide; For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch
as thou art that almightie Lorde of
hoastes, whome nothing can resiste, but all
thinges doe yeelde to thy gouernment, it is à
verie easie thing for you to maintaine and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fende
your Church, against all manner eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
which it hath. And therefore I beseech
you, showe foorth this your power in defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the Church against the furie both of the
diuels and wicked men, which partlie by
snares, and partlie in open feelde doe set-vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
your Church.</p>
               <p>The latter reason whereby the petition is
adorned,<note place="margin">The latter reason.</note> and vpholden, is this, <hi>O God of Iaa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kob.</hi>
This reason is taken from the loue of
GOD towarde the Church. For when he
mentioneth Iaakob, hee hath à respecte vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the promise made vnto Iaakob the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew
of Abraham, and to his seede, that is,
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:19032:242"/>
to so manie as by the faith of the promise bee
receaued into the familie of Iaakob, that is into
the Church. And the promise made to Iaakob
is founded in the blessed seede Iesus Christ;
therfore it is so much as if he had saide: <hi>Heare
my prayer, for our Lord and mediators sake euen
Iesus Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In all our praiers let vs haue à considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of these two causes; the former whereof
teacheth how God is able to accomplish that
which wee desire; the other how that he wil,
&amp; that because of his fatherlie promise. These
two causes the Lorde ioineth-together in the
forme of praier which he commendeth to his
disciples,<note place="margin">Matth. 6, 9.</note> when hee saith: <hi>After this manner
praie yee, Our Father which art in heauen.</hi> For,
when we saie, <hi>Our father,</hi> we signifie y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fatherly
goodwil of God toward his sonnes, that is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> faithful: And when we ad, <hi>Which art
in heauen,</hi> we shew y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> diuine maiestie &amp; power
of God wherby he is able to do whatsoeuer he
will. For he will doe whatsoeuer he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised.
For the promise is voluntarie and free.</p>
               <p>Furthermore of these two thinges are ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered.
The first is how theie alone can right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
and effectuallie praie, who haue the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise;
the seconde, that the force of praier de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth
not vppon the dignitie of man, but
of the mercie of GOD which promiseth to
heare all, that through faith vppon the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:19032:242"/>
doe call vpon him.</p>

               </epigraph>
               <p>THe repetition of the praier is also adorned
with two reasons, the former whereof con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth
both the aboue mentioned, For it is
taken both from the power, and also from the
willingnes of God. For when he saith, <hi>O our
protector, or shield,</hi> he doth insinuate both the
power whereby hee can, and the willingnes
wherebie God will assist. And when hee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
also, <hi>Looke vpon the face of thine annointed:</hi>
He fetcheth his reason in like sorte from the
vertue of the promise. For when God an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed
Dauid for king ouer his people, hee
promised withall to helpe him so often as
through faith hee called vppon him. And
therefore in à certaine Psalme hee saith,<note place="margin">Psal. 32, 7.</note> 
                  <hi>Thou
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:19032:243"/>
preseruest me from trouble.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 32. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>Saue thou mee that
being saued, I maie praise thy name.</hi> Verie manie
such like sentences are in the Psalmes.</p>
               <p>Moreouer this reason is fitlie applied to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie
godlie man in his lawful vocation. For, as
Dauid was called of God vnto the kingdome;
and therfore he craueth of God that he would
defende his owne ordinance: So euerie one
that is called vnto anie function, whether it be
ciuill or ecclesiastical, shoulde perswade him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
that his calling is of God, and therefore
that God wil defende his owne ordinance, &amp;
heare such as call vppon him through faith.
This comfort they doe lacke, which rush-vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
euerie function through fraude without

THE reason of the last proposition, <hi>Looke v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
the face of thine annointed,</hi> that is, grant
that I, who am made à king of you, maie be
restored to my kinglie dignitie. And although
in this mine exile I coulde get mee the fauor
of the kinges my neighbors, yea and dwell &amp;
liue pleasantlie together with them: yet more
doe I esteeme the Church of God, where the
worde is preached, and according to the word
of God both praiers be made, and sacrifices of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered,
than the glorious palaces of kinges: yea
and so am I affected, that I woulde chuse to
haue the basest and vilest office in the Church
of God, than without the Church in the pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces
of wicked kinges which neither knowe
nor call vppon the God of Israel, to florishe
with riches, power, honors, and pleasure.</p>
               <p>So that this place doeth teach what an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
it is to bee à citizen of the Church of
God; so that the most contemptible function
in the Church is to bee desired before y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
glorie of worldlie kings &amp; princes, which
without the householde of God, doe either
serue idols, or bee meere Atheistes, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
none other GOD besides their bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But how came this affection in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> most holie
king Dauid? The reason of this affection is not
seene with the eies of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> body, but only with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
                     <pb n="460" facs="tcp:19032:244"/>
eies of faith; it is not learned in the courtes, &amp;
pallaces of worldlie kinges, but in the sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arie
of God: as Dauid himself acknowledgeth,
when he saith:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 73, 16</note> I thought to know this <hi>(namelie
whie the Church is oppressed, and the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked

vntil I w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

I their endes.<note place="margin">18.</note> Surelie thou hast sette
them in slipperie places, &amp; castest them downe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

They perished for their sinne:<note place="margin">23.</note> yet I was alwaie with
thee,<note place="margin">24.</note> thou hast helde by my right hand. Thou wilt
guid me by thy counsel, and afterward receaue me
to glorie.</p>
               <p>Dauid therefore by the eies of faith not
onelie considereth the glorie of the church, &amp;
the future happinesse of the citizens of the
same; but also thinketh vppon the most la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable
destruction of those men, who call
not vppon God in his congregation. Of both
which, that is, of the happines of the Church,
and damnation of the vngodlie, Dauid him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
speaketh on this wise:<note place="margin">Psal. 73, 27</note> 
                  <hi>Lo, theie which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawe
themselues from thee,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">28.</note> 
                  <hi>shall perish; thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroiest
al them which go à whoring from thee. As
for me it is good for me to draw-neere vnto GOD;
therefore I haue put my trust in the Lorde God,
that I maie declare al thie workes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But what is the cause whie so manie migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
men of the worlde,<note place="margin">Whie the wicked goe on in wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes.</note> doe not consider their
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:19032:244" rendition="simple:additions"/>
endes, the better to order their liues as they
shoulde? The causes hereof are three, as Paul
saith, namelie, the vanitie of mind; the blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of their vnderstanding; and the hardnes
of their heart. The vanitie of minde bringeth
to passe, that such honest things as are thought
to bee embraced by à dreame as it were, doe
forth-with vanishe-awaie without profite.
Blindnes of vnderstanding doth so carrie the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
awaie, that of those principles of vertue im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed
naturallie in the mindes of men, they
followe nothing but errors. And through
their hardnes of heart, they are touched with
no feare of God. Whereof it is, that with
à reprobate minde wee embrace for goodnes
in deede, colored good thinges; for true riches,
false; vaine glorie for true praise; beastlie and
moste filthie pleasure for true delight; and
for the right preheminence, vaine arrogan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie.</p>
               <p>Of this vanitie, blindnesse, and hardnesse,
the Lorde by the Prophete Ieremiah, spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
on this wise:<note place="margin">Ierem. 4, 27.</note> 
                  <hi>My people is foolishe, theie
haue not knowen mee, they are foolishe children,
and haue none vnderstanding; they are wise to doe
euill, but to doe well theie haue no knoweledge.</hi>
Whence it proceedeth that, according to the
saying of Salomon, <hi>Theie reioce in doing euill,
and delight in the frowardnesse of the wicked.</hi>
To which kinde of men Isaiah crieth with à
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:19032:245"/>
lamentable voice, Wo, when he saith: <hi>Wo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

                  <hi>&amp; pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
in their owne vnderstanding.</hi> For one daie
through the most righteous iudgement of
God they shall bee condemned to euerlasting
tormentes. Notwithstanding Epicures which
delight wholie in their filthie delightes, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
because they thinke there is no God at
all; or if there be à God, they suppose hee will
not be angrie, seeing hee is all mercifull; or if
hee will be angrie, that hee will not alwaies
keepe hatred in remembrance, they doe not
regarde anie whit the wrath of God. But
this extreme vanitie both the daie of doome
in the sight of all creatures, of diuels, of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
and of men, shall reprooue, and also
the verie conscience, which is à witnesse
of à iudgement to come doth speake against.</p>

               <p>THIS is an Aetiologe. For it rendreth the

in the Church, rather than to enioie euen the

which are peculiar to the citizens of God

doe lacke, but also are wrapped in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie
miseries. Wherefore they are to bee il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrated
by waie of Antithesis, that each maie
appeare, namelie both howe great the glorie
of the Church, and contrariwise howe much
the miserie of those is who are without the
Church.<note place="margin">1. Blessing of the Church.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The first good thing or benefite of the
Church is, that God himselfe is in the same as
à most bright Sunne; which thing I do refer
both vnto the cleare knowledge of God; and
vnto the affections agreeing with the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge;
and also vnto the manifold consolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:19032:246"/>
which the godlie doe take through the
light of this sunne. For as from the Sunne
which we do behold, proceedeth to the world
both light, heate, and beames, wherebie all
things are quickened, and nourished: So from
God, who is an inuisible Sunne of the Church,
there proceedeth both light, that is à cleare
knowledge of God; and heate, that is, the
burning affections of hope, faith, and loue;
and also beames, which are the manifold con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solations
wherewithall the soules of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>are
quickened, nourished, and made merie.</p>
               <p>This Sunne, as it ariseth vpon such as feare
God: So it goeth-down from negligent, wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
and prophane folkes. And therefore
great heede is to be taken, least the godlie doe
suffer this Sunne to be darkened, and hidden
from them. For as it is à most certaine token
of death to à sicke man; as Hippocrates saith, if
he dreame that this visible Sunne is hidden, or
obscured: So à most certain death of the soule
is nigh at hand, if our Sunne Christe be darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by abolishing or corrupting of the true
doctrine. So that so manie as are desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of this Sunne, as are all theie which be
without the Church, they can not bee other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
than most miserable. For, they being
blinde and ignorant of God, both doe groape
in the grosse darkenes of ignorance; and are
beaten-downe with an horrible amazement
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:19032:246"/>
of their mindes, when sinne sheweth it selfe
abroade in their consciences. And although
the consciences of manie seeme to be seared as
it were with an hot iron, as if it were voide
from all feeling of sinne: yet at the point and
paine of death, it is awakened, yea &amp; it driueth
the miserable soule vnto desperation.</p>
               <p>The seconde benefite of the Church is,<note place="margin">The second blessing of the Church.</note> that
God himselfe who is the Sunne, is also to
the Church in place of. à shielde wherewith
the householde of the Church are compassed,
protected, and saued against the kingdome of

where it is saide: <hi>Let all them that trust in thee,
reioice and triumph for euer, and couer thou them:
and let them that loue thy name, reioice in thee.
For thou,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">12.</note>

                  <hi>Thou hast giuen mee the shielde of thy
saluation, and thy right hand hath staied mee.</hi> For
it seemeth good in the sight of God, that the
godlie shold not only be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>passed about with
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> crowne of his good wil, but also be happie
through euerlasting blessednes. When Paul
writeth vnto the Ephesians,<note place="margin">Ephes. 6, 16.</note> 
                  <hi>Take vnto you
the shielde of faith, wherewith yee maie quench

y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> then we are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>passed-about with the shield
of faith,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 1, 18</note> when reteining an vnshakened faith
of doctrine with à confidence of mercie,<note place="margin">19.</note> and
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:19032:247"/>
à good conscience, wee fight à good fight.</p>
               <p>Now what thing, I praie you can be more
miserable than the enimies of God, who haue

and <hi>glorie.</hi> For thus hee saith, <hi>The Lorde will

also adorning the Church with an vnspotted

or righteousnes. Nowe forsomuch, as the

But they which are without the Church,
be destitute of this grace, guiltie, &amp; damned in

that beleeueth.</hi> Hee is perfect by obedience,
which loueth obedience to God warde more
than all thinges of the worlde. Yet is not
this perfection an absolutnes of worke accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the rule of the law: but it is a purpose,
an endeuorment, and a studie of the minde,
whereby a man daielie more and more goeth
forwarde vnto the marke of perfection.</p>
               <p>Ths endeuorment throught the approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

                  <pb n="468" facs="tcp:19032:248"/>
And that this Christian perfection is to
be referred vnto the will, and affection of the
heart, these testimonies ensuing doe witnesse:
<hi>Feare the Lorde,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iosh. 24 14.</note>

my sonne, knowe thou the God of thy father, and
serue him with à perfect heart, and with à willing

doeth testifie howe hee fulfilled the same,
when hee saide,<note place="margin">Isai. 38, 3.</note> 
                  <hi>I beseech thee, Lorde, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
now how I haue walked before thee in trueth,
and with à perfect hart, and haue done that which
is good in thy sight.</hi> And this perfection Paul re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth
when he saith,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>Fight à good fight, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
faith and à good conscience.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">19.</note> For through
faith the obedience of Christe, which is the
fulfilling of the Lawe, is obteined: &amp; à good
conscience is kept by a willingnes to obeie,
whereby a godlie man preferreth obedience
towarde God before all thinges; although ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
cannot fulfill the same in such absolute forme
as the rule of the lawe doeth require.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, when the Psalmist doeth saie:
<hi>No good thing will he depriue them of which walk
innocentlie,</hi> it is to bee vnderstood concerning
the rewarding of the obedience showen
through faith. For in this place hee speaketh
not of the causes of saluation: but of the effect
of faith, wherewith being iustified, we are sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued:
And therefore this and such like senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:19032:248"/>
of which sort there be manie in the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
be thus to bee vnfolded. They y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> walke
innocentlie shall not bee depriued of good
thinges. Whie so? Because they which walke
innocentlie, doe beleeue: And al beleeuers are
righteous through Christ his righteousnesse
imputed vnto them: To the righteous, life
and abundance of all good thinges, in such
sorte is proposed, that they shal desire nothing
to the consummating of true happines. And
therefore so manie as walke innocentlie shall
not be depriued of good thinges. After which
sort the like sentences are to bee vntied, that
wee maie be led from the proper effect vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the proper cause; and againe, conclude fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the proper cause other effectes adioined and
following of the same, as when it is saide;
<hi>Blessed are they which suffer persecution for the
confession of Christ:</hi> heere mention is made not
of the cause of blessednes, but of the effecte of
faith, and of that which necessarilie doth fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe
faith. And therefore the sentence is thus
to be opened. They are blessed which suffer
persecution for the confession of Christ. Why
so? Because they doe beleeue. For it is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
effect of faith to confesse Christe in the
time of persecution. But the faithfull bee
righteous through Christe his obedience.
And the righteous doe liue, and are blessed
by the hope of eternall felicitie. Therefore
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:19032:249"/>
they who suffer persecution for the confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Christ, are blessed.</p>
               <p>Nowe the holie scripture vseth this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of speech, for two causes. One is, that we
shoulde iudge of true and liuelie faith by the
naturall properties which it hath, leaste for
the true faith wee embrace a fained and false
faith. Another is, that we maie be stirred-vp
with the promise of the rewarde of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
the more cheerefullie to doe our dueties,
and not waxe negligent in respect of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold
difficulties which happen manie times,
and make manie slouthful.</p>
               <p>But touching this point wee haue spoken
more at large aboue, where wee confuted the
errors of Papistes, who verie naughtilie doe
confounde the causes and effectes; and manie
times of the qualities, affections, and workes
of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> saintes, do make the causes of iustification
and saluation, whose errors bee ouerthrowen
by the pretious bloode of our onelie media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.
For in the matter of iustification al mans
merites are quite contrarie vnto the merite of
Christ his death.</p>
               <p>Last of all, seeing the wicked which wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

And therefore confidence dependeth
vpon the promise of free mercie: Free mercie
dependeth vpon fatherlie kindenes. Fatherlie
kindenes is grounded in the merite of the
sonne: the merite of the sonne is the ransome
for the sinnes of the whole world; which ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
is by faith applied to man. For as the
medicine not being applied vnto the diseased

promise of fre mercie in Iesus Christ although
of it selfe it be true and strong: yet doeth it
not profit man vnlesse he haue faith where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by

               <p>And yet maie it not bee thought that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
through faith is made in respect of
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:19032:250"/>
the merite, or dignitie of the beleeuing man,
but for Iesus Christ his sake, whome man

he maie be purged from sinne, and endued
with his righteousnes, wherebie God maie ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept

and for which it promiseth life.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding after that man is iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by faith,<note place="margin">Effects of faith.</note> he is to liue by the virtue of the
spirite of faith. For it cannot be that à man at

of the same. Hence it is that the scripture
doth iudge of faith by the properties thereof,

FOrsomuch as Dauid in this place doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
those blessed that trust in God; and
no man can be blessed vnlesse he be righteous.

they be righteous; for no man euer yet was, or

what is the true sentence of the Church of

               <p>The fourth, of the rewarde of the good

THe first order of testimonies concerneth
the extreme right of the lawe according to
the rule of Gods iustice, which is the lawe
it selfe. Nowe the extreme right of the lawe,
is to bestowe life and saluation vppon none
vnlesse by the sentence of the lawe hee be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced

of persons to adiudge so manie to the cursse,

as to bee condemned is by God through
the accusement of Moses or the law, the verie
conscience of man bearing witnesse againste
him named to be guiltie for transgressing the
lawe to bee pronounced vniust, and to bee
adiudged to eternal death as accursed of God:
So to be iustified,<note place="margin">Iustificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what;</note> is by God, through the qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
of Moses or the Lawe, the verie consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence

<pb n="478" facs="tcp:19032:253"/>
life as blessed of GOD, and that in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specte
of the couenant betweene GOD and
man.</p>
               <p>This being set downe, I will propose à de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration,
whereby it shall appeare that no
mortall man, since the fal of our first parentes,
can legalie be iustified before the tribunal seat
of God, Iesus Christ onely excepted, who is
both God and man, pure from all sinne, &amp; ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutelie
righteous according to the law. And
the demonstration is this.</p>
               <p>Whosoeuer doeth perfectlie fulfill the
lawe of God, is righteous by the lawe, and
heire of eternall life by the promise of God.
And contrariwise, hee that doeth not fulfill
the lawe, is accurssed, and subiect to the wrath
of God, and to eternall paines, according to
the sentence of the lawe.</p>
               <p>But no man since the fall of our first pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentes,
Christ onelie excepted, was euer found
that coulde fulfill the lawe of God.</p>
               <p>Therefore, no man is righteous by the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of the lawe, and heire of eternal life, by
the couenant of God, but Christ alone, who
beeing free from contagion of sinne, did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectlie
fulfill the lawe: but all other besides
him, are by nature subiect to the cursse, to
the wrath of GOD, and to eternall tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes.</p>
               <p>The maior is proued from the extreme
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:19032:253"/>
right of the lawe, that is, from the promises
and threateninges of God his lawe. And this
no man will denie, as apparent by the worde
of God: but the minor is in controuersie. For
both the Pelagians, and the Papistes doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecte
the minor, as vntrue: but theie builde
not both vpon the same foundation.<note place="margin">Pelagius.</note> Pelagius,
because hee tooke-awaie originall sinne, and
taught how sin was sent-ouer to the posteritie
of Ada<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not by propagation, but by immitation
onely, ascribed to the power of man, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> theie
could by their natural strength of them selues
fulfil the lawe of God, and by the merites of
good workes attaine euerlasting life. And,
forsomuch as erroneouslie hee supposed that
Christ was à meere man, and yet for all that
yeelded perfect obedience to the lawe, hee
concluded that other men likewise, if they
woulde, might obserue the lawe, and thereby
be iustified, and saued.</p>
               <p>But howe weake,<note place="margin">Against Pelagius.</note> yea howe false the
foundation of Pelagius is, the scripture in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
places doeth euidentlie declare. For in
that hee saith, howe sinne is sent-ouer to the
posteritie of Adam by imitation onelie, it
is most vntrue, as Paule in his first Chapter
vnto the Romanes doth most cleerelie teach,
where he handleth this verie argument, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
that wee are guiltie not by imitation, but
by propagation. <hi>As by one man,</hi> saith hee,
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:19032:254"/>
                  <hi>sinne entered into the worlde, and death by sinne,
and so death went ouer all men: forsomuch as all
men haue sinned.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 5, 12.</note> Againe, <hi>Death raigned from A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam

not after the like maner of the transgression of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">14.</note>
Are not these wordes quite contrarie to
the saying of Pelagius, which imagineth that
sinne is sent-ouer by imitation onely? Againe,
<hi>By the offence of one, manie are dead,</hi> that is, all
which were borne of Adam according to the

of man is corrupted, and guiltie. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
vnto the Ephesians Paul saith, <hi>Wee were
by nature the children of wrath, so wel as others.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="481" facs="tcp:19032:254"/>
The foundation therefore of Pelagius being
taken awaie, the building, wherevpon he had
builded, doth of it selfe come vnto the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d.
So that when Pelagius doth argue thus: <hi>We
are borne without original sinne, and onelie by i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitating
sinful Adam we are made guiltie; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
by the power of nature we can fulfil the lawe:</hi>
the Antecedent is constantlie to be denied, as
that which is contrarie both to the course of
the whole scripture, &amp; to the iudgement of al
good writers.</p>
               <p>And whereas the saide Pelagius doth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
that Christ was onelie man &amp; not God
too, and yet notwithstanding yeelded ful o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
to the lawe; and therefore others al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
maie fulfil the same, it is à friuolous argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and ouerthrowne by the consent of the
whole Scripture.<note place="margin">Christ not a meere man, as the Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians did teach.</note> For the whole Scripture
doth commend Christ God and man to vs;
saith he is the onelie sauiour; testifieth that
he is the beholder of heartes; and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth
him to be present in all places.</p>
               <p>Now y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Papists which also denie the minor
of our argument, builde vpon another foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
to wit vpon à false definition of God
his lawe. For with the Pharisees theie thinke
that the lawe doth onelie restraine the hande,
as theie saie, and requireth onelie outward ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil
workes, which when men doe, theie saie
how theie are iust before God, and doe merit
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:19032:255"/>
by their obedience eternal life, original sinne
being abolished through the death of Christ.
And therefore theie define the iustification of
the vngodlie, to be à remissio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of sinnes; and à
perfection of good works.</p>
               <p>But how vane and friuolous this toieng
of the Papistes, is, first the Law it selfe, which
brideleth concupiscence, doth shewe. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condlie,
Paul compareth the Lawe of nature
&amp; of men together, as things cleane contrarie.
<hi>We know,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom 7, 14.</note> saith he, <hi>that the law is spiritual, but I
am carnal, soulde vnder sinne.</hi> By which sai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eng
he doth signifie, that the carnal man, as
carnall, can not yeelde spirituall obedience
to the Lawe. He calleth him carnal, which
in another place he calleth <hi>à natural man, who
hath not the spirite,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iude verse. 19.</note> as Iude doth interpret the
same, that is, which is not borne anewe by
the holie Ghost. Thirdlie the Law it selfe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth
à perfect, pure, and constant loue both
of GOD, and our neighbour: which loue
vndoubtedlie is not an external and outward
worke, but an inwarde and spiritual, exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
the puritie of affections, which are not
to be founde in men that are not regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated.
Last of al, the interpretation of
Christ, which he himselfe opposeth against
the Pharisees, doth sufficientlie confute this
dreame of the Papistes.</p>
               <p>Moreouer hauing thus laide open the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:19032:255"/>
of Pelagius and of the Papistes, I wil
gather foure demonstrations out of Paul,
wherewith I wil confirme the minor of our
demonstration, which is, that no mortal man
can yeelde no perfect obedience to the lawe
of God.</p>
               <p>The first is taken from the common cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
of mans nature. For al men from
their birth are vncleane and guiltie: nowe
seeing from an vnpure and stinking foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
there cannot chuse, but issue foule and
filthie water, it cannot be, that an vncleane
man, can yeelde pure and cleane obedience.
For so saith Salomon,<note place="margin">Eccle. 7. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>Surelie there is no man
iust in the earth, that doth good and sinneth not.</hi>
And Iob,<note place="margin">Iob. 14, 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Who can bring à cleane thing out of
filthinesse? there is not one.</hi> For al the sorte
of vs do proceede from à sinneful masse. For
the effecte cannot be better than the cause.
So that this argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is strong: <hi>Theie which are
vncleane, cannot yeelde pure obedience: Al men
by nature are vncleane, Christ alone excepted, who
was exempted from the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon law of such as are
borne: Therfore none can yeelde pure obedience to
the lawe of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The second is taken from the general ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,<note place="margin">The second argument.</note>
or punishment of guiltines in al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
Whosoeuer be subiect to death, which is the
punishment for violating Gods law, theie are
breakers of God his Lawe; otherwise God
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:19032:256"/>
should be an vniust iudge for punishing the
innocent: but now Paul confesseth, <hi>that the
iudgement of God is according to trueth.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 2, 2.</note> But al
men are subiect to death, as the to punishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
for violating Gods lawe, which thing the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable
experience of al men from time to
time, doth testifie. Therefore al men are brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
of God his lawe. How then can theie be
righteous by the lawe?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The thirde is taken from the testimonies
of Scripture,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The 3. Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.</note> 
                  <hi>which are the verie voice of God

Euangelistes, and writinges of the Apostles.
In Moses it is written,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gene. 6. 5.</note> The Lorde sawe that
the wickednesse of man was greate in the earth,

I know verilie that it is so:<note place="margin">Iob. 9. 2.</note> for howe should man

                  <hi>The same Iob saith againe,</hi>

of Paul, who vnto the Romanes writeth after
this wise,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 3. 9. 10.</note> We haue alredie proued, <hi>saith he,</hi> that
al, both Iewes and Gentiles are vnder sinne. As
it is written,<note place="margin">11. 12. 13.</note> there is none righteous, no not one.
There is none that vnderstandeth, there is none
that seeketh God. Theie haue al gone out of the
waie; theie haue beene made altogether vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table;
there is none that doth good, no not one.
Their throte is an open sepulchre; theie haue v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
their tongues to deceite; the poison of aspes is
vnder their lippes.<note place="margin">14, 15. 16, 17.</note> Whose mouth is ful of cursing

Destruction and calamitie are in their waies; and
the waie of peace theie haue not knowne. The
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:19032:257"/>
feare of God is not before their eies. <hi>Of these &amp;
such like testimonies our proposition is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
which is, that no man perfectlie can ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil
the lawe of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fourth is taken from the necessitie,<note place="margin">The fourth argument.</note>
and ende of the mediator giuen betwene God
and men. For if man by his natural strength
could haue fulfilled the lawe of God, he had
not needed à mediator. For he had beene
righteous by the workes of the lawe; and had
by the couenant of GOD obteined eternal
life.<note place="margin">Leuit. 18, 5.</note> For it is the couenant of God: <hi>If à
man doe my commaundementes, he shal liue in
them.</hi> But nowe seeing man hath neede of
à mediator and reconciler, doubtlesse he brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
the lawe, and is guiltie, vnrighteous,
and accursed. Therefore the scripture, which
conteineth either the promise, or the exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Messiah, doth accuse mankinde of
sinne, and sendeth vnto the mediator, paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fier,
and intercessor. Hence Paul fetcheth an
argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in his second chapter vnto the Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians
when,<note place="margin">Gal 2, 21.</note> he saith, <hi>If righteousnesse be by the
Lawe, then Christ died without à cause:</hi> that
is, the Sonne of God in mans nature, in vaine
did humble himselfe, euen vnto the death of
the crosse, if man by the lawe maie be iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
whereas the Sonne of God tooke the
nature of man vpon him, that he might abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishe
sinne, bring euerlasting righteousnesse,
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:19032:257"/>
and therein cause vs to be adopted into the
sonnes of God. Let the Papistes take the
lawe in this place for what part it pleaseth
them: yet the same conclusion must follow.
For whether righteousnesse be by the lawe
moral, or by the iudicial, or by the ceremonial,
or by altogether, the same absurditie doth fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
namelie, <hi>that Christ died without à cause.</hi> If
he died in vaine, he was also borne in vaine, &amp;
al his benefitie are in vaine. By these foure in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincible
argumentes, the iudgement of the
Church, which thinketh together with the
whole Scripture, that no man can be iustified
by the workes of the lawe, forsomuch as man
yeeldeth not pure, perfect, &amp; continual obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
therevnto, is confirmed.</p>
               <p>Nowe,<note place="margin">Touching the vse of the lawe.</note> this being so, to wit, that no man
can obserue perfectlie the comaundementes
of God; nor by the works of the lawe be iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
before God, it maie be demaunded, what
maie be the vse of the law. For we must of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie
acknowledge that the lawe is not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen-out
in vaine. Vnto this question we
must make this answere: Although by the
workes of the lawe no man is iustified before
God, because no man is able to satisfie the
same: yet is there à diuers vse of the same,
which is to be considered according to the
condition of the states of men. I doe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitte
the external and political vse, which
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:19032:258"/>
is to gouerne outward manners by discipline
agreeing with the law: because we now are in
hande with that vse of the law which concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
the conscience of man before the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
seate of God. Therfore before iustificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
&amp; regeneratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,<note place="margin">Vse of the Lawe in the conscience.</note> this is the vse of the law in the
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science of man, namely to teach, to accuse, &amp;
to condemne. It teacheth both what is to be
done, and what is to be auoided of him, that
seketh life by the lawe: It accuseth the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressor;
it pronounceth him guiltie, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth;
and that to this ende, that the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
hauing confessed his wickednes, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
both the wrath of God, and his owne
miserie, may sue for fauor, which thing he is
not able to attaine of the law, by the strength
of nature. Whereby the law is to the wounded
conscience an occasion of seeking Christ the
Physition. And hereof is the law called <hi>A
Schoolemaster vnto Christ.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 3. 24.</note> Hitherto belongeth
that of Paule to the Galathians.<note place="margin">22.</note> 
                  <hi>The scripture
hath concluded al vnder sinne, that the promise by
the faith of Iesus Christ, should be giuen to them
that beleeue.</hi> This selfe same thing doeth the
Lord teach in a parable of the debter, where a
certaine king doth of his seruaunt,<note place="margin">Matt. 8, 23. 24. &amp;c.</note> whom he
knew was not able to paie his debt, demaunde
ten thousand talents due to him by the lawe:
which thing he did to the ende that the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant
confessing his pouertie, might flie to the
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:19032:258"/>
mercie of his Lord, therby to obtaine a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
discharge of the whole debt. By this
parable the vse of God his law in the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
of men before free forgiuenes of the
whole debt and iustification, is depainted. For
as this debtor payeth nothing of his debt, but
is freely forgiue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: so the law in the act of iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
is vtterlie idle, as y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which is neither the
cause, nor a parte of our righteousnes as it is
wrought of vs.<note place="margin">The vse of the Law af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter mans iustification.</note> But after that man is iustified,
the spiritual vse of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law is, to prescribe those
things which belong vnto a spiritual man, or
a rule of spiritual seruing of God. And so the
promises of the law be fulfilled in the faithful
through Christ.</p>
               <p>These things beeing thus learned,<note place="margin">A confutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their argumentes which think that by the workes of the Law me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are iustified.</note> it is no hard
thing to refel the arguments of them, who
conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that by the wotkes of the law men are
iustified before God. Therfore when out of
Moses they do obiect: <hi>He that doth the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements
shal liue in them:</hi> Therfore by the
workes of the law man is iustified: It is to be
answered that the argument is vntrue.<note place="margin">Leuit. 18. 5.</note> For by
the law it must be considered what the law in
al respects, or the iustice of God doth require,
not what ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is able to do; that we may flie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mercie of God, confessing our weakenes,
especialie seeing it is apparent, that no man is
able perfectlie to obserue the law.</p>
               <p>Yet more forceablie they do vrge, and they
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:19032:259"/>
obiect vnto vs the saying of our Lord, <hi>If thou
wilt enter into life,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matt. 19. 17</note> 
                  <hi>keepe the commaundementes.</hi>
Hereof theie conclude à condition of keeping
the commaundementes of God, and that by
keeping the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> men are are iustified, yea &amp; saued.
But what the Lord ment by those words, the
parable which euen now we mencioned doth
teach. For as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> King there exacteth of his deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ten thousand talents, and frankelie forgaue
the whole det to him which had nothing
to paie, but flied vnto the mercie of his cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor:
So the the Lorde vnto the proude hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite
doth saie: <hi>If thou wilt enter into life,
keepe the commaundements:</hi> to the ende that
the hypocrite discending into himselfe, might
confesse his filthinesse, and pouertie, and so
craue pardon;<note place="margin">Luk 7, 48.</note> which had he done, he had heard
with the sinful woman, <hi>Thee sinnes are forgiuen
thee.</hi> We must therfore acknowledg how the
obseruation of God his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundements is pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nounced
both by Moses &amp; Christ himselfe to
be the right &amp; most readie waie vnto life: but
the faulte is in our selues, whie by that waie,
though it be verie direct, we enter not into life.
For the condition cannot be perfourmed of
vs, as aboue it hath beene showen. So that by
the commaundementes the effect is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
because the condition is not obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
which is, <hi>If thou doe the Lawe,</hi> but the
defect of al men rather, that acknowledging
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:19032:259"/>
our imperfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, we maie flie vnto the mercie
of God. And this is the doctrine of Paul con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the vse of the lawe before conuersion:
<hi>By the lawe</hi> saith he,<note place="margin">Rom. 3, 20<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>commeth the knowledge of
sinne.</hi> Yet this knowledge is not to the ende
that we shoulde die in our sinnes: but that we
shoulde seeke Christ, as Paul saith in another
place,<note place="margin">Rom. 11. 32.</note> 
                  <hi>He hath shut-vp al in vnbeleefe, that he

the opinion of them, who with the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees
compounde Christian righteousnesse
both of workes and faith, as it were of causes

be hindered. For doubtlesse it pleaseth po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical
fellowes and ignorant folkes marue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louslie,
when the lawe and the Gospel, or
faith and workes in the iustification of man
before God are coupled-together. For thus
theie saie, we are debters of the lawe, we grant
à great defecte in vs, which Christ perfour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth.
Therefore let vs doe what we can, &amp;
beg that which is behinde of Christ. And
so theie ascribe à parte of righteousnesse to
their owne workes, and merites; and à parte
to Christ his merites: So, that some doe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate
more, and some lesse of Christ his
merites, according as theie doe abounde, or
want. Theie who thus doe thinke, doubtlesse
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:19032:260"/>
haue no parte of Christ his fauour, as most
sacrilegious, who arrogantlie doe take à part
of Christ his office, which is to saie, to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
against whom both the whole Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and the consent of the true Church is
opposed.</p>
               <p>But in this place let vs onelie set Paul the
Apostle, and doctor of the Gentiles against
them, who in manie places disputeth to the
ouerthrowing of this Pharisaical opinion.
As Romaines,<note place="margin">Rom. 3. 21.</note> 3. <hi>The righteousnesse of God is
made manifest without the Law,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 4, 13.</note> Rom. 4. <hi>The

                  <note place="margin">14.</note> 
                  <hi>faith is made voide, and the promise is

most plainelie doth take iustification
from the Lawe, yea, and from al workes too;
and ascribeth the same to faith alone, teaching
that the promise is voide, and faith à vaine
fiction, if before God we are iustified by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
works, that is, if the workes of the Lawe
be either causes, or partes of our iustification

they cannot sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d together, as causes or parts of
righteousnes or saluation.<note place="margin">Rom. 11, 6.</note> 
                  <hi>If it be of grace</hi> (saith
he) <hi>it is no more of works; or els were grace no more
grace: but if it be of workes, it is no more of grace;
or else worke were no worke.</hi> For, as Augustine
saith, <hi>it is grace no way, which is not free grace
euery way.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ephe. 2, 8. 9.</note> Hitherto belongeth that of Paule
in an other place, <hi>By grace are ye saued through
faith, &amp; that not of your selues; it is the gift of god,
not of workes, least any man should boast himselfe.</hi>
Could any thing be spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> more plainly? Here
Paul saith not as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Papists do <hi>of faith and works;</hi>
but he excludeth workes, that grace may be
grace; that saluation may be à gifte; and that no
man should glorie in the sight of God, as brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
any merit, which should moue god to iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie
him. This boasting is excluded also by
the Apostle in another place, where he saith,
<hi>where is then the reioicing?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 3, 27. 28.</note> 
                  <hi>it is excluded. By what
Lawe? of workes? Naie, but by the Lawe of faith.
Therfore we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude that à man is iustified by faith
without the workes of the Lawe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hereby I suppose it is more cleere than the
daie, that theie do erre, which compound
Christian righteousnes of faith and workes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
as it were of causes &amp; partes. Moreouer
theie, who seke for licentiousnes of life from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
doctrine of free iustification, shalbe answered,
God willing, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> third sort of testimonies.<note n="*" place="margin">Or in the chapter im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatlie following.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="495" facs="tcp:19032:261"/>
Now then,<note place="margin">True iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> what,</note> hauing laid open the errors tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
the equitie of the Gospell, I will plainly
deliuer, and shew which is the true waie to be
iustified according to the word of God, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
gospel. To be iustified therfore according to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
Gospel, is, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beleeuing ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who is absolued
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al guilt of sinne, &amp; redeemed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the curse
of the law, by God to be pronounced free for
the ransome sake paide by the mediator; to be
made righteous by the righteousnes of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator
imputed to him; and finaly, to be adiud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to eternal life, as a beleeued sonne in the
beloued, freelie for the mediator Christ his
sake.</p>
               <p>So then,<note place="margin">3. Thinges required in iustification.</note> for him that would be righteous
before God, three things are necessarie. One is,
that beeing absolued from sinne, &amp; redeemed
from the cursse of the law, he be a free man; an
other is, that he haue righteousnes, wherby he
may in deede be, and be thought righteous; the
thirde, that beeing made righteous, he be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opted
for a sonne, and be liked and loued of
God, as a beloued in the beloued. These bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings
no man can giue but God onely; and
therfore Christian righteousnesse is sometime
called <hi>The righteousnesse of GOD,</hi> because it
is God that iustifieth; sometime <hi>The righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of Christ,</hi> for that his obedience, beeing
imputed to vs, is made our righteousnesse;
and sometime <hi>The righteousnesse of Faith,</hi>
                  <pb n="496" facs="tcp:19032:262"/>
forsomuch as it is free, as that which through
faith is apprehended, while we beleue the gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell.<note place="margin">Luk. 24, 47.</note>
Therfore the Lord saith, <hi>Repentance and
remission of sinnes must be preached in my name a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
al nations.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Remission of sinnes what;</note> The remission of sinnes is the
verie absolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from guiltines, &amp; the redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from the cursse of libertie. With this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
two other things are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ioined, namelie
righteousnes &amp; adoptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or free acceptatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
life eternal. Hetherto also belong the words
of the Angel vnto the Virgin:<note place="margin">Matt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1, 21.</note> 
                  <hi>Thou shalt cal his
name Iesus: for he shal saue his people from their
sinnes.</hi> Here by the word of saluation, al the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefites
of the mediator be vnderstood. But
of these things we wil entreate particularlie,
the more distinctlie and cleerelie to vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
these benefites which we obteine by Christ.</p>
               <p>First therfore we attaine remission of sinnes,
as Paul saith, by the bloud of Christ. For the
obedience of Christ vpon the crosse, is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> price
whereby the iustice of God is satisfied for the
sinnes of al those which through faith do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert.
For so saith Paul: <hi>whom</hi> (meaning Christ)
<hi>God hath set to be a reconciliation through faith
in his blood.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 3, 23.</note> So that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> merit of Christ his bloud
is the clea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sing of sinnes, which bloud is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a sufficient ransome, because it is the bloud
of the sonne of God. Therfore in the Acts it is
saide:<note place="margin">Act. 20, 28.</note> 
                  <hi>that God hath purchased the Church with
his owne bloud.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="497" facs="tcp:19032:262"/>
And that he which hath remission of sinnes,
that is, which is absolued from the guiltines of
sinne, is also redeemed from the cursse of the
lawe, and partaker of the libertie of God his
children,<note place="margin">Gala. 13, 13</note> these sentences do approue. <hi>Christ
hath redeemed vs from the cursse of the law, when
he was made a cursse for vs.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ioh. 8, 34. 36</note> Againe, <hi>Whosoeuer
committeth sinne, is the seruant of sinne. If the
sonne therefore shal make you free, ye shalbe free in
deede.</hi> So then whosoeuer do ascribe euen the
least merite of cleansing sinnes to any other
thing beside the blood of Christ, they do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
Christ his blood, and extenuat the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of the Lordes death: of which merit we are
then made partakers, when we beleeue in Iesus
Christ.<note place="margin">Rom. 3, 25.</note> Therefore Paul doth say, <hi>through faith
in his blood,</hi> that is, when a man knowing the
promise of grace, doth verilie beleeue that his
sinnes are forgiuen him for the blood sake of
Christ, he is truelie partaker of the merit of the
Lord his death, through which he is absolued
from sinne; redeemed from the condemnation
of the law; and set free from the bondage of
sinne and Satan.</p>
               <p>With the remission of sinnes righteousnes
is ioyned, wherby the beleeuer is iustified, that
is, becommeth in verie deede, and is iudged
righteous before God. And this righteousnes
is the second benefit of Christ, in our iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Which righteousnes is nothing else, than
<pb n="598" facs="tcp:19032:263"/>
à perfect fulfilling of the lawe,<note place="margin">True righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse what.</note> done indeede
by Christe, but ascribed or imputed to vs
that beleeue.<note place="margin">Rom. 10, 4.</note> For so saith Paul, <hi>Christe is
the ende of the lawe for righteousnes vnto eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
one that beleeueth,</hi> that is, so manie as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue,
haue that which the Lawe requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,
namelie righteousnes, but not done of
them, but imputed to them. For so saith
Paul; <hi>To him that worketh not, but beleeueth
in him that iustifieth the vngodlie,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 4, 5.</note> 
                  <hi>his faith is
counted for righteousnes.</hi> Now that this righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes
that is imputed to vs, is Christ his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
the compariso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which Paul doth make,
witnesseth.<note place="margin">Rom. 5, 19.</note> 
                  <hi>As by one mans disobedience,</hi> saith
he, <hi>manie were made sinners: So by the obedience
of one, shal manie also be made righteous,</hi> meaning
so manie as beleue.<note place="margin">2. Cor. 5, 21.</note> And in another place, <hi>He
hath made him to be sinne for vs which knewe no
sinne, that we should be made the righteousnes of
God in him,</hi> that is, Christ was made for vs
sinne, which is à sinner through the imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the guiltinesse of al our sinnes to him,
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we might be made righteous with God, and
that by the righteousnes, not sticking within
vs, but which, being in Christ, is imputed
of God to vs through faith. Then we are so
the righteousnes of God in him, as he is sinne
in vs, to wit through imputation. And this is
it which Augustine doth saie: <hi>Our sinnes, he
made his owne sins, that he might make his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:19032:263"/>
to be ours.</hi> Herevnto both Moses, the
Psalmes &amp; Prophets, do agree. Moses he wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth:<note place="margin">Gene. 3. 15.</note>
                  <hi>The seede of the woman shal bruse the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents

                  <note place="margin">Gene. 22<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> Again, <hi>In thy seede</hi> (which is Christ)
<hi>shal all the nations of the earth be blessed.</hi> This
blessing cannot be without y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> remission of sins,
righteousnes, and allowance of God. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
blessing be through Christ, deliuerance
also fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the cursse is through him; &amp; through
the remission of sinnes (we atteine) imputation
of righteousnes and God his fauor. And in the
Psalme it is,<note place="margin">Psal. 22, 31</note> 
                  <hi>They shal declare his righteousnes
to à people,</hi> that is, the Church shal preach, not
mans righteousnes by workes or ceremonies,
but the righteousnes of Christ which shalbe
imputed <hi>for righteousnes to so manie as beleeue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 10, 4.</note>
The Prophet Isaiah saith,<note place="margin">Isai. 53, 11.</note> 
                  <hi>By his knowledge shal
my righteous seruant iustifie manie: for he shal
beare their iniquities.</hi> This testimonie is verie
notable, for it teacheth how sinnes be washed
awaie through y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sacrifice of Christ; it teacheth
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Christ y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> righteous by his righteousnes doth
make others righteous; &amp; it teacheth also y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
is made through y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> knowledge of the

of Christ,<note place="margin">True know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Christ, what.</note> And y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is effectual knowledge,
whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the knowledg of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> minde, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beleefe of
the heart is ioined. Also by y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Prophet Ieremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah,<note place="margin">Iere. 23, 6.</note>
it is writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, <hi>This is the name wherby theie shal
cal him, the lord our righteousnes.</hi> Here y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prophet
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:19032:264"/>
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendeth Christ his diuinitie, and also pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth
howe we are iustified through his
righteousnes. Touching the application, the
same Prophet speaketh on this wise: <hi>Blessed
is the man that trusteth in the Lord,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iere. 17, 7.</note> 
                  <hi>and whose
hope the Lord is.</hi> Now he trusteth in the Lord,
who beleeueth, that being iustified by his
righteousnesse, he pleaseth God. For the
obedience of Christ, God and man, is the
most absolute perfourmance of the lawe; the
which sufficeth al, because it is the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of man who is God. This the Prophet
declareth when he saith, <hi>The Lord is our righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse.</hi>
So that from our heartes we must
beleeue, how the righteousnesse, wherebie
we are iust before God, is not anie qualitie,
or action in our selues, but the obedience of
Christ imputed to the faithful. So doth Paul
most expreslie distinguish betweene y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse
of man, and of Christ, when he
saith:<note place="margin">Phil. 3, 8.</note> 
                  <hi>I doe iudge al thinges but doung, that I
might winne Christ, and might be founde in him
not hauing mine own righteousnes which is of the
lawe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">9.</note> 
                  <hi>but that which is through the faith of Christ,
eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the righteousnes which is of God through faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nowe, if we haue remission of sinnes, and
righteousnesse through faith, to wit per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecte
righteousnesse, which is of Christe Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>su,
doubtlesse we are no more vnder the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
sentence of the lawe,<note place="margin">Deut. 27, 26</note> which is, <hi>Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:19032:264"/>
is he that confirmeth not al the workes of the
lawe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gala. 3, 10.</note> 
                  <hi>to doe them.</hi> And this meaneth Paul where
he saith,<note place="margin">Rom. 6, 14.</note> 
                  <hi>We are vnder the lawe</hi> (which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth)
<hi>but vnder grace</hi> (which iustifieth.)
Whie so?<note place="margin">Rom. 5, 18.</note> 
                  <hi>For that as through the offence of one</hi>
(to wit Adam,) <hi>the fault came on al men to
condemnation: so by the iustifieng of one</hi> (namelie
Christ) <hi>Grace abounded towarde al men to the
iustification of life.</hi> That is, As the sinne of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
was the cause of condemnation vnto e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
death: So the righteousnes of Christ is
the cause of iustification vnto eternal life.<note place="margin">Rom. 8, 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Now
then,</hi> as Paul saith, <hi>there is no condemnation to
them that are in Christ Iesu.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                  <hi>For theie are free fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the lawe of sin &amp; of death,</hi> through Christ the
deliuerer.</p>
               <p>The third thing which we saide was requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
for to make a man righteous before God,
is, that being adorned with Christ his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes,
he be adopted for the sonne of God,
and accepted vnto eternal life. For, as by faith
hee obteineth remission of sinnes, and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes:
so likewise by the same faith, we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine
the right of adoptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and the dignitie of
Gods children,<note place="margin">Ioh. 1, 12.</note> according to that of Iohn, <hi>He
gaue power to be the sonnes of God, euen to them
that beleeue in his name,</hi> That is, he conferred
this heauenlie honor vpon the faithful that
theie both be, and be counted the sonnes of
God.<note place="margin">Rom. 8, 15.</note> And Paul: <hi>ye haue not receiued the spirite
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:19032:265"/>
of bondage to feare againe: but ye haue receiued
the spirite of adoption, wherbie we crie, Abba,

                  <note place="margin">16.</note> 
                  <hi>The same spirite beareth witnes with

                  <note place="margin">17.</note> 
                  <hi>that we are the children of God. If we

to be considered, to wit, as it is in the life be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
through faith; and as it shalbe consuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the bodies shal rise againe. Both these
adoptions haue their glorie. For by the adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
begu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we haue peace with God, which is,

worke-together for the best to vs,</hi> yea such things
as doe seeme most bitter. Wherof it is, that the
saintes, euen in the crosse, wherebie theie are
made like the onelie begotten Sonne of God,
doe reioice; according to the saying of Paul:
<hi>We doe reioice in tribulations,</hi>

the most comfortable sight of God. Of this
longing for glorie the Apostle speaketh when
he saith:<note place="margin">Rom. 5, 2.</note> 
                  <hi>We reioice vnder the hope of the glorie
of God.</hi> Together with this adoption, the
which at the last iudgement shalbe perfected,
formal righteousnes, wherebie we shalbe like
vnto God for euermore, is ioined. Which
righteousnes the Apostle saith we doe waite
for,<note place="margin">Gal. 5, 5.</note> when he saith: <hi>We through the spirit waite
for the hope of righteousnes through faith.</hi> And
what ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner of righteousnes that shalbe, Iohn

               <p>Out of the things which hitherto we haue
spoken, touching the iustification of man by
the method of composition, this definition
maie be framed.<note place="margin">Iustification what.</note> Man his iustification before
God is an absoluing of the beleeuing man
from sinne; an imputation of Christ his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes;
and à receiuing of him vnto eternal

               <p>Nowe the more fullie to open this our iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification,<note place="margin">Causes of mans iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</note>
let vs in order, yet verie brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
beholde the causes. The cause therefore
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:19032:266"/>
preparing is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> preaching of the gospel, which
maketh vs to acknowledge and to feele our
infirmitie, &amp; iust damnation. The which sense
Paul doth terme <hi>the spirit of feare,</hi> because at
the preaching of the law it is raised vp in men
through the holie spirite.<note place="margin">Rom. 8, 15.</note>
               </p>
               <p>When Peter in the Acts vpon the day of Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecost,
had accused his countreimen the Iewes,
for violating both tables of the Lord, they con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceiued
in their minde the spirit of feare, that is,
a wonderful dolor and griefe, or pricking in
their consciences for their sinnes. Therfore af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
in their perplexitie, doubtfulnes, and
despairing as it were,<note place="margin">Act. 2, 38.</note> he biddeth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>to amende
their liues, and be baptized euery one of them in
the name of Iesus Christ,</hi> which was in deede a
preaching of the gospel. This conuersion is
made through faith, which men do conceaue
through the holie ghost, when they hearken
vnto the gospel. By this faith Christ wholy,
<hi>who of God is made vnto vs wisedome and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 1, 30. 31.</note>
                  <hi>and sanctification, and redemption,</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued,
<hi>that he that reioyceth, doe reioyce in the
Lord,</hi> and praise him euerlastingly. And this is
that knowledge of saluation, hid from the wise
and men of vnderstanding of this worlde, but
reuealed to the Church, through the worde of
the gospel.</p>

workes do iustifie; 3. Wherein we and the
Papists do differ about good works.</head>
               <p>ALthough the fruite of the righteousnes of
faith, is neuer to be separated from faith:
yet with al diligence is it to be distinguished
from our iustification. For the proper benefit
of Christ, which we obteine by faith alone, is
one thing; and our due obedience, which, as the
fruite out of the tree springeth from faith,
through which we be regenerate, &amp; borne the
the sonnes of God, is another. Wherof it is
that by the natural properties that it hath, we
iudge of a liuely faith; euen as by the frute we
iudge of the tree. Hence it is, that in this order
of testimonies, the worde <hi>to iustifie,</hi> hath an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
sense, than in the afore mentioned orders
it had.<note place="margin">Iustification what.</note> For in this place <hi>to iustifie,</hi> signifieth to
shew and declare a man to be righteous. As in
the Epistle of Iames man is saide <hi>to be iustified
by workes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iam. 2, 24.</note> because through workes he sheweth
and declareth himselfe to be righteous. And
in the scripturs oftentimes theie are pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
blessed, which giue themselues to good
workes: not that good workes be causes, or do
merit happinesse; but for that they are true to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:19032:267"/>
of their cause, which is faith, or the spirit
of faith,<note place="margin">Rom. 8, 14.</note> 
                  <hi>For so many as are led by the spirit of God,
they are the sonnes of God.</hi> And hence it is that
the Lord in the gospel after Matthew saith,
<hi>Blessed are the meeke;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matt. 5, 5. 7. 9. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>blessed are the merciful;
blessed are the peacemakers; blessed are the patient.</hi>
For these virtues, if they be true, and not hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritical
showes of virtue, do proceede from
faith, whereby righteousnesse is laid holde on;
and they be vndoubted markes of the children
of God, declaring the adoption. Therfore this
rule is to be helde in memorie: when diuers ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectes
doe depende alike of one and the same
cause, the consequent doth holde from one ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
vnto the other, because of their common
dependance. In Luke it is written, of the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,<note place="margin">Luk. 7, 47.</note> how <hi>many sinnes were forgiuen her: for
she loued much.</hi> Now, because both, I meane re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of sinnes, and loue, depend of faith, as
of a proper cause, the argument is good from
loue vnto the remission of sinne, because of
their common dependance. Sophists, who
thinke that Christ descended from the cause
vnto the effect, and made loue the cause of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of sinnes, do peruert the meaning of
Christ: as by the parable which the Lorde
bringeth-forth before them, it is manifest.
<hi>There was a certaine lender,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luk. 7, 41.</note> saith he, <hi>which had
twoo debtors: the one ought fiue hundred pence,
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:19032:267"/>
and the other fiftie:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">42.</note> 
                  <hi>when they bad nothing to pay,
he forgaue them both. Which of them therefore,
tel me,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">43.</note> 
                  <hi>wil loue him most? Simon answered, and
saide, I suppose that he, to whom be forgaue most.
Afterwarde,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">50.</note> 
                  <hi>he saide to the woman, Thy faith
hath saued thee, goe in peace.</hi> Doth not the Lord
here plainly declare, that remission of sinnes
doth go before loue, and both, to wit, remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
and loue to depende of faith, as of their
verie cause? For many times effectes, whereof
some doe follow others, which notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
shoulde be referred vnto their proper
cause, to auoyde the confusion of causes and
effects, be ascribed to one and the same cause.
Hitherto belongeth the rule of Augustine,
<hi>When,</hi> saith he, <hi>we do finde such places in the
Scriptures as do seeme to attribute righteousnesse
to workes, special regarde must be had vnto the
foundation from which they do spring.</hi> And when
they proceede from faith, they are to be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed
vnto the roote. For example, Blessed
is he that iudgeth wisely of the poore; the
Lorde shal deliuer him in the time of trouble.
Here mercie toward the needie and poore is
not set for a cause of blessednesse. For mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
is a particular worke whereby the law of
God is not satisfied. But such manner of
speech Dauid vseth, because the effecte is a
most certaine argument of the cause it hath.
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:19032:268"/>
So that the man which hath mercie on the
poore is blessed, because he beleeueth. Now
then through faith he pleaseth, the worke also
pleaseth; not for the perfectnes thereof, but
for that God accepteth it; because the person
is not vnder the lawe, but vnder grace.</p>
               <p>And that it is necessarie, that the workes,
which God accepteth of, must proceede from
faith,<note place="margin">Rom 14, 23</note> it is manifest. <hi>For whatsoeuer is not of
faith,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 11, 6.</note> 
                  <hi>is sinne.</hi> And, <hi>without faith, it is impossible
to please God.</hi> The Lorde himselfe doth saie,
<hi>Without me ye can doe nothing.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ioh. 15, 5. 4</note> 
                  <hi>As the branch
cannot beare fruite of it selfe, except it abide in
the vine:</hi> No more can man doe anie thing,
vnlesse he abide in Christ through faith. For
before we be regenerate, we are euil trees,
<hi>Which cannot but bring foorth euill fruite;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matt. 7, 18.</note> 
                  <hi>wee
are the children of wrath,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eeph. 2, 3.</note> and dead in sinne; we
are flesh,<note place="margin">Rom. 8, 7.</note> 
                  <hi>Whose wisedome is enmitie against God;</hi>
we are natural me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,<note place="margin">1. Cor, 2, 14</note> 
                  <hi>which perceiue not the things
of the spirit of God.</hi> And therefore whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
God promiseth to such as do good works,
that must not be promised indifferentlie to al:
but onelie to such as obeie through faith. For,
seeing the iust doe please by faith, theie doe
necessarilie bring foorth the fruites of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse
of faith, namelie good workes, which
no more can be separated from the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of faith, than the natural propertie from
the subiect. Wherefore as the argument is
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:19032:268"/>
alwaie good from the subsistence of anie sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect,
vnto the natural propertie of the same;
and contrariwise, the propertie being set, the
subiect of necessitie must be seene: so faith
which iustifieth man, being set, good workes,
which are y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> properties of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> spirit of faith, are
necessarilie set. And againe, good works being
set, faith, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which theie do spring, must needs
be set: So whersoeuer faith is not, good workes
are not, &amp; wher good works be not, ther is not
faith, the cause of good works. Therfore saith
Paul,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 1, 18. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>Fight à good sight, hauing faith and à good
conscience, which some haue put awaie, and as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
faith, haue made shipwracke.</hi> So often
then as promises doe seeme to be annexed to
good workes, we are to make recourse vnto
the roote, and ground, namelie faith. For,
as there be two beginnings of thinges, one is
that theie be; the other that they be known: so
faith, as the beginning of being, worketh so,
that thou art righteous; and good workes, as
the beginning of knowledge, bring it to passe
that thou art knowne to be righteous. Hence
the Lorde at the last daie wil propose the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of knowledge to the righteousnesse
of faith which shalbe apparent in the sight of
al creatures.<note place="margin">Mat. 25, 34 35<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> For thus he wil saie: <hi>Come ye blessed
of my father, inherit ye the kingdome prepared for
you from the foundations of the world. For I was
an hungred, and ye gaue me meat; I thirsted, and
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:19032:269"/>
ye gaue me drinke; I was à stranger, and ye lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
me.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">36.</note> 
                  <hi>I was naked, and ye cloathed me; I was
sick, and ye visited me; I was in prison, and ye came
vnto me.</hi> Here the Lorde wil not haue the
workes of mercie toward his members, to
be merites of the heauenlie kingdome; but
by certaine tokens he declareth who are the
sonnes of God, vpon whom the kingdome
of God freelie for Christ his sake without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
merites of man, shalbe bestowed. For so
saith Paul,<note place="margin">Rom. 6, 23.</note> 
                  <hi>The gift of God is eternal life, through
Iesus Christ our Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And although by that which hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
hath beene spoken, it is none harde thing
to iudge howe our doctrine concerning good
workes differeth from the papistical ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations:
Yet that the more distinctlie and
particularlie this difference maie be seene,
I wil adde somewhat more here-vnto, and
that for two causes: the firste, to shewe the
vanitie of those men, who hearing that both
we, and the Papistes doe require good
woorkes, doe thinke that we striue not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
matters of importance, but onelie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
words, and that of pride onelie to gaine-saie.
Wherebie theie doe sufficientlie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wraie
themselues to know nothing touching
this controuersie of so great importance, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which al our saluation doth depend. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condlie,
that godlie auditors maie be rightlie
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:19032:269"/>
instructed in this matter, and necessarie do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine;
&amp; maie haue alwaie in à readines wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
to answer such as indeuour to ouerthrow
our religion, and slaunder the same without
reason, either of meere malice, or of grosse
ignorance.</p>
               <p>The difference therefore betweene vs and
the Papistes touching good workes consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth
in foure thinges, to wit, in the matter,
efficient causes; in the manner; and in the oft
doing of good woorkes. If we shal proue
this thing by euident argumentes, I thinke
there is none but wil graunt, if so be he wil
yeelde vnto the truth, rather than to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
of his own minde, that for iust causes we
are prouoked thus to contend.</p>
               <p>The firste difference therefore is taken
from the matter of workes.<note place="margin">1. Differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, concerning the matter of good workes.</note> For the Papistes
doe place their chiefest workes, and worship
in the traditions of men, the which theie pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
before Gods comaundementes: which
traditions for al that partelie be in their kinde
indifferent,<note place="margin">Of Papistes works what the chiefe.</note> as appointed fastes, and certaine
songues, but in their vse and ende vtterlie
wicked;<note place="margin">Papistical traditions of what sorts.</note> because theie put à confidence in
them, while theie perswade themselues that
by obseruing of them, theie doe merite the
remission of sinnes: partlie theie are super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious,
&amp; meerelie ethnical, as hallowing of
water, of fire, of herbes, of candles with infinit
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:19032:270"/>
such toies, wherevnto also theie doe ascribe
the power to abolish sinne, and driue awaie
diuels: and partlie theie are apparantlie wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
as such are that are contrarie to the word
of God, as is the inuocation of saintes; the
marchandise of masses; the worshipping of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages;
the bearing about, &amp; adoratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of bread.
These and the like traditions, the Papistes
with fire and sworde doe vphould, caring
little or nothing at al for the breach of God
his commaundements, as euidentlie appeareth
by the verie punishmentes which theie doe
appoint.<note place="margin">Howe the Papistes doe regarde the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes of God.</note> For in the Papacie the contempt
of the idolatrous Masse is more sharpelie pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished,
than adulterie or incest. A much
more heinous offence is it among the Papists
to eate flesh vpon à Fridaie, than to kil à man
vpon anie daie. Wherebie it is apparent that
the Papistes doe preferre their traditions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the commaundementes of God:<note place="margin">The proper note of An<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tichrist.</note> which
thing is the proper note of Antichrist. For,
as theie contemne the sentence pronounced
against the Pharisees,<note place="margin">Mark. 7, 7.</note> which is, <hi>Theie worship
me in vaine, teaching for doctrine mans traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:</hi>
So theie doe rashlie arrogate to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
power to make lawes in the Church of
God: which thing is doubtlesse none other
thing than to exalt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues aboue God, who
chalengeth to himselfe alone the authoritie
to enact lawes in his owne kingdome.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="513" facs="tcp:19032:270"/>
But we doe submit our selues to God,<note place="margin">The princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal good workes of Protestants.</note> whose
commandements we both doe beleeue, and
teach also to be the rules of good workes.
But the commaundementes and traditions of
men, we do not acknowledg for the seruice of
of God, but rather with Paul we pronounce
them to be <hi>the doctrine of diuels.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Tim. 4, 1.</note> For this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement
of God, <hi>Walke in my preceptes,
and not in the preceptes of your fathers,</hi> we doe
preferre before the authoritie of al men what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer,
and of Angels. Nowe let the godlie
reader iudge, wether it be more conuenient
to yeelde to the Papistes or to vs, in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
or substance of good works. For my part,
I thinke no man is so mad, as to obeie men,
who both can deceiue, and maie be deceiued,
rather than God that cannot erre.</p>
               <p>The second difference is fetcht from the

               <p>But we with Christ, the Prophets, and

vnto the actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of virtue, or à good worke,

be required. The iudgement of the minde,
God, by his light, that is, by his word, wherin
the holie spirit worketh, doth inlighten, that
we maie both knowe what pleaseth, and what
displeaseth God, à certaine some whereof is
proponed in the tenne commaundementes,
and more at large are opened in the writinges
of the Prophets and Apostles. And this is it
which Dauid saith,<note place="margin">Psal. 119, 105.</note> 
                  <hi>Thy word is à lanterne vnto
my feete.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondlie God maketh the wil of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
good, while he doth renue the same
in the regenerate by his holie spirite.<note place="margin">The wil of man.</note> The wil,
as it is à natural facultie, hath in it selfe no qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
at al; but is altogether such, as y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is which
it imbraceth. If the thing be good, the wil is
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:19032:271"/>
good; but if the thing be euil, it is euil. And
therefore Damascene doth rightlie define it,
<hi>That the wil it selfe is of nature: but diuerslie to
wil, is proper to the person.</hi> And Chrysostome,
<hi>The wil is ingraffed and bredde in vs by nature,
and it is also of God.</hi> And the wil of this or
that thing is ours, and our iudgement, that is
not of nature, but of the person. But nowe,
when the state of the person doth change, the
qualitie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wil must change also of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
But that the person is wicked, as that
which is led by the sense of the flesh, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandeth
not the thinges which are of the
spirite of God, before regeneration, it hath
aboue<note n="*" place="margin">In the 3. Chap. of this 4. part.</note> beene declared. And therefore
there is no doubt, but the wil of à person not
iustified, is euil, that is, wicked, set againste
God, the slaue to sinne, albeit it worketh
freelie, and not constreinedlie. For volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarilie
it chooseth euil for good things. This
will of man, before regeneration, would haue
God altogether either not to be able, or not
willing to reuenge, or ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t altogether of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
wickednes it hath committed. And therefore
that woulde that he were not à God, which
so much as in it is, would haue him to be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of no power, or not righteous, or i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnorant.
Cruel, and altogether curssed malice
is it, to desire that the power, iustice, and
wisedome of God should perish.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="516" facs="tcp:19032:272"/>
But, forsomuch as in iustification, man is
at once both regenerated, and made à newe
creature in Christ Iesus, according to the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of this newe state, the wil of the person
taketh à newe qualitie, so that the wil which
before regeration was euil, the slaue of sinne,
and enimie to God, is nowe made good, free,
à friend of God, and deliting in his commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements.
For the minde being lightened by
the worde, and the heart through faith being
purified, the wil commaundeth those thinges,
which the sound iudgement of the mind doth
allow, and wherevnto the pure affections doe
incline. Therefore as the regenerate man is à
newe creature: so the wil of à newe man, is
created anewe by the holie Ghost; euen as
Dauid declareth when he saith:<note place="margin">Psal. 51, 10</note> 
                  <hi>Create in me
à cleane heart, ô God, and renne à right spirit
within me.</hi> By the hearte he vnderstandeth
both pure affections, and also à wil obeying
pure affections: by à right spirite he meaneth
the election of the wil, and purpose in that
which is good. So that it is the worke of God
his spirit, that the wil is made good where it
was euil; which being made good, it worketh
cheerefullie (yet through grace) and not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strainedlie,
otherwise wil should not be wil.</p>
               <p>In the thirde place, the iudgement of the
minde being reformed by the word; and the
wil renewed through the holie Ghost, the
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:19032:272"/>
strength also by little &amp; little is restored, and,
according to the measure of faith, doe grow,
wherbie we begin to doe somewhat which
pleaseth God, although in this life we shal
neuer be able to satisfie the lawe, according
to the rigor of his iustice. The repairing of
this strength is wrought by the virtue of the
death, burial, and resurrection of Christ in
the faithful. This virtue of Christ is after
à sorte depainted in our baptisme, as Paul
teacheth in his 6. chapter vnto the Romanes.
Moreouer, when the person which is iuste
through faith, keepeth à good conscience, and
thinketh continualie of going forwarde, his
defections are wel taken; for he is not vnder
the lawe, but vnder grace.</p>
               <p>The thirde difference betweene the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes
and vs about good workes,<note place="margin">3. Differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce about good workes.</note> is taken
from the manner. For theie doe thinke that
to be a good worke, when that is externallie
done, that is commaunded. For theie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
no more vnto the forme of à good work,
than the action it selfe.</p>
               <p>But wee with Augustine doe pronounce,
that à worke ought then to be called and
thought good, when the thing commaunded
is done as it should be, according to the mind
of the commaunder. The hypocritical Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risee
giueth almes; and the iustified Publican
giueth almes in like sorte. His, that is the
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:19032:273"/>
Pharisies almes the Papists define to be a good
worke; whereas before God it is abhominable:
but we pronounce the Publicane his almes a
good worke, not onely because it is comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
but specialy because through faith, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the Publicane was iustified, it was done to
the glorie of God. And therefore it hath the
forme of a good worke, when the worke com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
of God, by a person iustified through
faith, is done principaly for God his glorie.
And a worke so done, whether it be an inward
or an outward work, is the spiritual seruice of
God.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, wheras certain ciuil works, done
euen of such as are not iustified by faith, are
profitable and do good to manie, and therfore
thought good works<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I grant they are so caled,
and be such too, but in vse, not in seruice. For
whatsoeuer an impure person doth, it is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure
&amp; abominable before God. And though
God sometime doe recompence such workes
with rewardes, he doth it for the vse sake, not
because they are the seruice that pleaseth him,
or be good of themselues.</p>
               <p>The fourth thing wherin we dissent from
the Papists in the doctrine of good workes,<note place="margin">4. Differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce about good workes.</note> is
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> diuersitie of ends. For they do appoint other
endes of good works than we do, which folow
the direction of God his worde. For they say
good works are to be done, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we may deserue
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:19032:273"/>
fauor, &amp; be iustified through our works before
God. But how false &amp; absurd this Pharisaical
opinion is, we haue already in the first order of
testimonies declared. That no works do merit
fauor iustificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, it is hereby manifest, because
<hi>an euil tree ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not bring forth good fruite.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matt. 7, 18.</note> Therfore
what can a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not renued, seeing he is wicked,
vnpure, without vnderstanding, vnprofitable,
merit by vnpure works? Again, if a man be iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified
by works before God, it must needes of
necessitie be, either because he fulfilleth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whol
law, according to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rule of God his iustice, or
in respect of particular obseruing som certaine
commandement. But each is false. For as aboue
<note n="*" place="margin">Chap. 3. of this fourth part.</note>we haue proued, no mortal man can fulfil the
whole law of God, neither before conuersion
nor after. Secondly, it is manifest that none is
iustified by a particular fact, both because it is
not the fulfilling of the law, which is required
vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> righteousnes of the law; &amp; also for that
he <hi>which faileth in one commandement,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iam. 2, 10.</note> as Iames
doth say, <hi>is guiltie of al.</hi> Then seeing no man
may be iustified neither by the whole law, nor
by a part of the same, in vane doe the Papists
contend, that the ende of the lawe is, that men
by their owne workes should be iustified in
the sight of God.</p>
               <p>But we do teach that good workes be ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to be don,<note place="margin">The true ende of good workes.</note> that being iustified by faith, we
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:19032:274"/>
may giue due obedience to God, as children to
a most louing father; that we may be founde
liuely branches, and bearing frute in the true
vine, which is Iesus Christ; that men seeing our
good workes, may glorifie God, and be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked
vnto wel doing by our example; that
through good works we may be directed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hauen of blessednes; that by good workes,
as by an vndoubted marke of Gods children,
we may shew our selues enimies to Satan, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
in baptisme we renounced; y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we may encrease
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ioy of the angels in heauen, which are much
delited with the repentance of men, aud with
holines of life; and that by workes we may be
knowne, and declared to be truly righteous,
that is, that we be not deceaued with a vaine
shew of faith, as it happeneth vnto hypocrits,
as Iames in his seconde chapter declareth; for
whom to be iustified is to be declared and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
righteous before the world.<note place="margin">Iam. 2, 23.</note> 
                  <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham
beleeued, aud is was imputed vnto him for
righteousnes.</hi> Bu when at the commaundement
of God, he was readie to kil his onely sonne,
by his willingnes to obey, he declared how he
was righteous, not onely to others, but also to
himselfe. For liuely faith hath this propertie,
that it preferreth obedience toward God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
al worldly things, be they neuer so deere,
as appeareth in Abraham. So that he which is
so affected, that he desireth nothing so much
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:19032:274"/>
as to obey God, and to preferre obedience to
him-ward before al things els, he hath a most
certaine token of a liuely faith, and of the spirit
of Christ, wherby he is moued, dwelling with
in him.<note place="margin">Rom. 8, 14.</note> 
                  <hi>For so many as are led by the spirit of God,</hi>
saith Paule, <hi>they are the sonnes of God,</hi> to wit,
through faith, a true note wherof is that moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the spirite, wherby we are moued to
yeelde obedience to God with al readines; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
we continualy do feele a combat of the
flesh with the spirit, which fight vndoubtedly
in this life, shal neuer cease.</p>
               <p>The summe of this difference, tendeth to
this point. The papists do make workes to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue
and to procure saluation: we with Paul
number them among the effectes of faith, and
fruits of the righteousnes of faith. The Papists
doe place the perfection of righteousnes in
works; we define them to be an obedience be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon,
pleasing God, because of the perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that is
righteous, which obedience can no more be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
from free iustification, than the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
propertie from the subiect it hath, as heate
from fire, as aboue hath been showen.</p>

THe fourth order, as we proposed, is tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
the rewarde of good workes, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the promises of god, which the godly,
without iustification, do lawfully behold, and
through faith expect the things promised, as
Moses is written by faith <hi>to haue had respect vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the recompence of the reward.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 11, 26.</note> Moreouer, the
rewarde is promised to good works, somtime
simply to euery man, sometime specialy to this
or that man for a particular worke, which is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
in some certain thing. And that right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
without error we may iudge of such co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon
and special promises, this principle is to be
kept in minde, namely, that al promises with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Christ be to none effecte. For, if as Paul
saith,<note place="margin">2. Cor, 1, 20.</note> 
                  <hi>al the promises of God are in Christ yea and
Amen,</hi> that is, firme and ratified; it foloweth,
that no promises without Christ can take ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
&amp; be firme. Whereof this also is gathered,
that none obedience without Christ, doth me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
reward. Now this foundation being cast,
let vs entreate of the promises of rewarde, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
vnto the difference which we haue
proposed.</p>
               <p>Therefore when reward is promised simply
or in general to euery man for good workes,
as when both in the Psalmes, and also in Paul
it is said,<note place="margin">Psal. 62, 12.</note> 
                  <hi>He wil reward euery one according to
his workes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 2, 6.</note> the promise must be applied by a
distinction. For such a promise hath a double
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:19032:275"/>
respect. Because it is to be referred either vnto
the vnregenerate, or vnto the regenerate. If
it be applied vnto the vnregenerate, which are
without Christ, by the principle which we
haue set downe, it must needes folow that it is
neither ratified, nor performable: wherefore it
is referred vnto the first order of testimonies.
For it proponeth the iudgement of the lawe
concerning the rewardes of good workes. But
forsomuch as an impossible condition, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,<note place="margin">Leuit. 18, 5.</note>
                  <hi>if a man do my commaundements, he shal liue
in them,</hi> is annexed, it cannot be, but that the
vnregenerate are subiect vnto this damnatorie
sentence of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law,<note place="margin">Gala 3, 13.</note> 
                  <hi>Curssed is euery man that con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tinueth
not in al things which be written in the
booke of the law,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Deut. 27, 26</note> 
                  <hi>to do them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if such a promise be referred vnto the
regenerate in Christ, the promise is firme and
perfourmed,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 1, 20.</note> 
                  <hi>in whom al promises are yea and
Amen.</hi> But moe thinges in order be to be
noted in this place.<note place="margin">Rigor of the law.</note> Firste, how in the rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate
the rigor of the lawe is taken away,
which rigor consisteth in three thinges, that is
to say, that none obedience liketh God, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
it be perfect; that life is not promised, but
to them which fulfil the lawe; that the cursse is
denounced to al which offend, yea in the least
thing.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we are to thinke, that a man
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:19032:276"/>
nowe beleeuing, pleaseth God, as beloued
in the beloued; and as an heire of eternal life
for Christ his righteousnes imputed to him,
which is the waie of life and saluation, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to these wordes of Paul,<note place="margin">Rom. 10, 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Christ is the end
of the lawe for righteousnesse to euerie one that
beleeueth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdlie, it is to be considered, that of the
beleeuing man, whom for Christ his sake he
accepteth, God requireth obedience; and that
as à moste louing father he promiseth à re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde
to him not of det for anie goodnes, or
price of the work; but of meere grace, through
fatherlie kindenes, wherbie he imbraceth the
beleeuing man in Christ Iesus.</p>
               <p>Fourthlie, we must haue in minde that
workes so done through faith, be testimonies
of religion, euen as proper effectes be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
arguments of the cause, from which
theie proceede. And therefore is the Lorde
saide to rewarde euerie one according to his
workes,<note place="margin">Rom. 2, 6.</note> as when Paul saith, <hi>God wil rewarde
euerie man according to his workes,</hi> which
workes be tokens of faith, and most vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
arguments of the feare of God. Of these
workes mention shalbe made at the last daie,
that al creatures maie acknowledg the iustice
of God in iudging.</p>
               <p>But if à special promise be made in à cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
thing (as when Tobiah doth saie:<note place="margin">Tob. 12, 9.</note> 
                  <hi>Almes
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:19032:276"/>
doth deliuer from death, &amp; doth purge al sin,</hi> and
maketh men to finde life; and Daniel, <hi>Breake
off thine iniquities by mercie towarde the poore:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Dani. 4, 24.</note>
                  <hi>for that shalbe à salue for thine error,)</hi> this rule,
which dependeth vpon the principle which
we haue aboue set-downe, is to be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred.</p>
               <p>Touching à particular fact, we must iudge
according to the qualitie either of the deede,
or of the person that doth it. If we iudge
by the qualitie of the deede, it is moste
true, that no deedes of man, be theie manie
or fewe, can satisfie the lawe of God, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
<note n="*" place="margin">Chap. 2. of this fourth part.</note>in the firste order of testimonies we
haue declared: and therefore he cannot merit
either righteousnes, or life. But if according
to the qualitie of the person we doe iudge,
the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t wil be diuers, as the persons be.
For the person that worketh, either hath faith,
or he hath not. If the person which worketh,
hath faith, his worke done according to the
lawe doth please, and is imputed to him for
righteousnes, that is, it is thought to be righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
for so much as it pleaseth God in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of the person. But if the person that
worketh hath no faith, it is impossible that
the worke should please, while this rule shal
holde,<note place="margin">Rom. 18, 23.</note> 
                  <hi>whatsoeuer is not done of faith, is sinne.</hi>
And therefore diligentlie it would be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
what good workes be of themselues;
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:19032:277"/>
and of what account in respect of the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers.
Of themselues theie are of no valure,
neither doe theie merit anie whit: because
theie are not the fulfilling of the lawe.<note place="margin">Phil. 3, 8.</note> Before

y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vilest doung, as Paul speaketh, and abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable:
but after that righteousnes is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed

               <p>Now returne we vnto the saying of Tobias,
touching which I do saie first y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in the old tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation
which à little before I cited, the words
be verie corruptlie red. For according to the
Greek, theie should be thus red: <hi>Almes or libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie
doth deliuer fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> death,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tob. 12, 9.</note> 
                  <hi>and doth purge al sin.
Those which exercise almes &amp; righteousnes, shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be
filled with life.</hi> This sente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be applied
to the Pharisee, or to anie man y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is not regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat.
For, as the almes here co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended is à parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
work: so in the vnregenerat it is manie
waies polluted: So that it is to be referred vnto

<pb n="527" facs="tcp:19032:277"/>
cle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al iniquitie. But the last particle in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
