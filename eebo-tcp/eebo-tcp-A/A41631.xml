            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>
               </hi> Beg no Patronage,
I need no Apology.
Truth is the best,
&amp; indeed only true
Patroness: if in any
thing I have offended her, let it
be as a Null among Ciphers, and
signify nothing. As Popish Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
use to say concerning the
Church and Fathers. If any
thing be writ or said against
them, let it be unwrit, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said.
Though I should seem to
Apologise, it shall not be for any
<pb facs="tcp:53793:4"/>
thing I have writ; but only for
writing, in an Age, wherein
Letters are either neglected, or
distasted. We have lately sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fetted
of Knowledge, and now
disgorge, and nauseate it: or if
any Books be read, they are only
such as we disdain to read twice;
Pamphlets and Stories of Fact,
or angry Disputes concerning
the Times. In times of Action,
whosoever would appear consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable,
and make any moment
in Business, must pursue one of
the Extremes, and desperately
run up to the hight of it: &amp; so in
Writing, Preaching, or the like;
to speak plausibly of the Times, or
vehemently to oppose them, most
advanceth Fame and Followers.
Yea in all other Times, either to
Flatter Princes, and humor the
<pb facs="tcp:53793:4"/>
Vices and Vanities of the Age, or
Satyrically to lash them, hath
been the common Art of Writing;
which I wittingly waive, and
leave to others. Sober and Solid
Truth passes on in a streight
Line through the Crowd of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
and Confusions, without any
great noise or show of it self. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
good Books, as they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable,
so they are very chargea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
We may not call them our
own when we have bought them;
nor when we have read them. To
understand them rightly, <hi>didi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisse
fideliter,</hi> will cost almost as
much as to indit<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e them; and to
practice them far more. Men
think it sufficient to turn over
the Leavs, but never care to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Fruit: without which a
Book is wholly lost; writ and
<pb facs="tcp:53793:5"/>
read to no purpose. For my own
part, though I know writing of
Books to be a very mean employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and of no great efficacy;
when such writing as the famous
<hi>Talbot</hi> set on his Sword, <hi>Pro
vincere inimicos meos,</hi> is by
many counted the best Logike and
Rhetorike, and most authentike:
yet I am content to make use of
it, because I have no better
antidote against Idleness, and the
inconveniencies thereof. Having
often consulted with my self<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how
a man might live most happily
both here and hereafter, I used to
commit my Thoughts to Writing:
finding by experience, that as
Meditation is the Glass of the
Soul, so Writing steels it, and
strengthens the Reflection: re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenting
our scattered Notions
<pb facs="tcp:53793:5"/>
in a more entire and exact man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;
and imprinting them first
on our own spirits. I have lately
collected my loose Papers, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested
them into Method; and
now present them to the publike
view: that so others, if they
please, may share with me: and
if I may communicate some consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
benefit to any one Reader,
I shall account my endeavours
very well bestowed. However
they shall return into my own
Brest, and be alwaies welcome at
Home.</p>

<hi>Happy men if they Knew it,</hi> is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

the review and gazing on

the Mind to the very ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most

comprehend. These beget Love,
which is an Appetite of union.
Knowledge presents the Object to
the Soul, but Love resigns the Soul
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:53793:7"/>
to the Object, embracing and
mingling with it, and so sucks out
all the sweetness that is in it. This
heat of Love begets Joy and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,
as a flame of Light flowing
from it: and this Rejoycing in the
Object is the most perfect Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
thereof. True Happiness con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
both in the true Taste of the
Soul, and also in the truth of the
Thing it self. An ingenious Poem,
or pleasant Fable, made only to
take the ear, raise quicker affections
in the mind of the Reader, then
the bare nakedness of more profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Truth. There is indeed a truth,
of Art in witty fictions, which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
matter of delight, yet it argues
great vanity, to be more affected
with the Embroidery of an artificial
Ly, then with the Plain work of
better Instructions. There are other
meer deceptions. The outward
Senses deceiv the Fansie, and which
is more strange, the Fansie can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv
the very Senses, and operate on
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:53793:8"/>
them as much as the Thing it self,
not only as in a Dream, but when
they are waking and most intent.
He who sate in the empty Theater,
and seemed to see most wonderfull
Tragedies, was in a farther degree
of vanity then common Spectators,
who contemplated an <hi>Hercules.</hi> or
<hi>Achilles,</hi> or a great Prince in the
person of some mean fellow, whom
they knew to be most unlike to
them, but his Fansie was both Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctator
and Actor, which is a double
delusion. I do not think, as <hi>Avi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenna,</hi>
that Fansie can work mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
or as <hi>Paracelsus,</hi> that it can
create any thing: but though it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
form a Being, it can frame a
Fantasm, acting it within its own
Theater, and also delude the Senses
by it, which is as much as it receiveth
from them even of those things
which we really see or hear: For
the Thing it self remains without us
where it was, and that which comes
to the Fansie, is only a Show or Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parition
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:53793:8"/>
thereof. Thus Fansie irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tateth
the Bodily Humors, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voketh
the Affections; and those
Imaginary Objects of Joy, or Fear
may as really affect the Mind, as if
they were reall. But the worst of
all are Intellectuall Errors, and false
Judgments, for these seduce the
Mind it self (which being rectified
would correct the inferior Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties)
and betray us to vice and sin.
As the Heathen worshipped almost
all things eminently delectable or
formidable, Pleasures, War, Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases,
Riches, Honor, Virtue, Princes,
a Good and Bad <hi>Genius,</hi> Gods Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernall
and Infernall, and any thing
rather then the true Deity, so we
still commit morall Idolatry with
the same things, by our fals opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and adoration of them. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation
of any vain thing, as of
a Beauty, or the like, doth strangely
infect the soul, tainting and dying it
with the Image of the Object. But
above all, vain Admiration ravisheth
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:53793:9"/>
most: I call that a vain Admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which is not grounded upon
Knowledge, but meer Ignorance, &amp;
such as would be abated by a right
Undestanding. As he who sees on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
what is presented on the Stage,
is more affected with the Show, then
they in the Tiring room, whose eys
are conscious to the dressing &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonating
of the Actors. Thus to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
nothing, was by the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
(whose ambition was to know
all things in their causes) made a
chief part of true Happiness: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the Admiration of things truly
admirable, is a farther degree of
Happiness: when we rationally
know by what may be known, that
there is more excellency in the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
then we do or can know, and
therefore justly admire it. So we
admire the Divine Glory, which is
the highest enjoyment we can have
of the Infinity thereof. All these are
only Juglings and deceptions of the
Mind, but vain Love bewitcheth
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:53793:9"/>
and wholly possesseth it: and the
Delight which it causeth is as fals
and vain: for there can be no true
Happiness in being deceived: nor
doth the Pleasure extend further, or
last longer then the Delusion. A
Dream may satiate Imagination,
but cannot fill the Belly: and when
a man wakes he finds himself more
hungry and unsatisfied. These En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantments
of the Mind dissolv in
a moment at the presence of Truth,
who as she is the Daughter of Time
will at last arise like a bright Sun,
and chase away all those vain sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows.
In the mean time the more
we are ravished with the sense of
any fals Happiness, and thereby
withdrawn from that which is true,
we are so much the more truly Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy.</p>

Of the Degrees of Happiness.</head>
               <p>HAppiness is founded in Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge:
and therefore only
Knowing Creatures are capable
thereof, and according to their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
degrees of Knowledge, they
are capable of severall degrees
of Happiness. There are many
Worlds in one, and severall Shows
and Faces of the same things.
The first and lowest is the gross
Body of Heaven and Earth, which
though to us it appear glorious
and beautifull, is in it self dark
and dull, and without apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
The Iron seems to embrace the
Loadstone with great delight, and
to be rapt with an amorous Extasie,
so as <hi>Thales</hi> thought it animall, and
yet that motion is as void of the
least sense of pleasure, as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
inclination of Gravity to the
Center. The next is a World of
Sense, which is a Theater of <hi>Species</hi>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:53793:10"/>
and Emanations arising from the
former, being purified and subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
to the hight of Sense, which
by a conjunction with them, begets
a lively and sprightfull delight. The
least Bee finds more pleasure in
making and tasting a little Honey,
then the Sun &amp; all the self moving
Planets in their perpetuall Courses,
&amp; benign Influences, or the Plants in
their most flourishing Vegetations.
Another World is the Shop of Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,
which is a faculty more spirituall
then Sense, refining and composing
the simple <hi>Species</hi> thereof into va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
forms and figures: and as it
thus works within doors, so it also
apprehends the Beauty and Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of exterior objects: which is
greater matter of delight then to
view them at large. It hath also a
power of Meditating &amp; Admiring,
which is an higher kind of enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
then Sense. Naturalists sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
Insects, and some such Animals
to be wholly without Imagination;
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:53793:11"/>
but certainly the more perfect enjoy
it in a very notable degree. That
Discourse whereof they seem to
partake, is only the work of Fansie,
and a collation of sensitive notions.
Yet though Beasts excell Man in his
outward Senses, he probably excels
them all in Imagination: it being a
faculty in the next degree to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and much advanced by it.
Hence we so far exceed them in all
Mechanicall Artifices: Nature hath
furnished us with Hands, as fit In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments
for such Workmen, and
so with a larger portion of this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious
faculty to direct and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
them. Certainly Man hath
more acquaintance with the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and doth not only enjoy much
pleasure in the apprehension of
Beauty, Harmony, &amp; Elegancy; but
also in the very prevarications ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of:
we admire strange Deformities,
and behold them with Mirth and
Delight and are much affected with
Humors and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ooleries, which are
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:53793:11"/>
as Satyrs or Monsters of the Mind<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Therfore Nature hath bestowed on
us Laughter, to express some extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
Affection, whereof no
other Sensitive Souls are capable.
This excellency of Fansie, though
somewhat above the nature of
Beasts, is yet below Reason and
Judgment, for many men who have
least thereof, excell in the other by
a certain naturall aptness and feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city.
Beyond this Sphere of Fansie
is the Intellectuall Orb, or World
of Intelligences, which is an Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
of Sciences, furnished with
higher and more abstracted Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
whereby the Mind discovers
the very <hi>Idea</hi> and Module of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and her wise Government by
Causes and Effects, the Law of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
and Policy, the being of Spirits,
and Divinity it self. Out of this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectuall
World Beasts are wholly
excluded. Language is the chief In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument
of a Rationall Life, which
they want. As in Speaking or Books
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:53793:12"/>
they may hear and see what is Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
namely the Sound and Letters,
but understand not what is signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by them, so though they hear the
same Voice of Nature, and view the
same Book of the World with us,
yet they understand not the Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible,
or Philosophicall part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
which is a Scene of things as far
above Sense as that is above Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.
<hi>Adam</hi> had a larger share of
Paradise then the Brutes, though he
fed like them on Herbs and Fruits:
and joyed more in contemplating
their Natures, and translating them
into fit Names, then we now do in
feasting on their Carcases. Man
chiefly excells in these spirituall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights,
not only by apprehending all
other things, but also by reflecting
on Himself. It is a pleasant thing to
behold our face in a Glass, much
more to see our own Soul, which is
both Face, Mirror, and Ey. But
the least sight of Divine Glory ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visheth
the Soul with the greatest
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:53793:12"/>
joy. Here the Mind having mounted
the utmost Circle of Natures
Globe, taketh her flight, and passeth
over into Infinity, and there enjoys
not only the perfection of all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Good, but finds out another
and better Nature, and a new
World of Worlds: As God is the
chiefest Good, so Man being capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of Knowing him, is also capable
of the highest Happiness.</p>

Of Perfect Happiness.</head>
               <p>THE severall degrees of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
are capable of a proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable
Happiness and perfect Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
must be perfectly adequate
and proportionate to Knowledge:
for whatsoever the Soul can appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend,
it may in some kind enjoy,
and there cannot be perfect Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
without perfect Enjoyment.
Beasts have no other end of living,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:53793:13"/>
but to live: put them into pleasant
pastures, and leav them to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to eat and drink, and follow
the motions of their own nature,
they are Happy enough; because
they know no better or greater
thing to desire. When I hear the
Nightingall singing in a Wood,
though Poets Fansie her to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
of I know not what injuries,
I conceiv her then perched welnigh
on the top of her highest felicity,
free from care and grief, and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
her self with her warbling
notes. Surely these inferior Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turus
attain a neerer degree of their
perfect Happiness then Man doth
of his. A little satisfies a small sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,
whereas larger Bodies require
more. The Soul of Man, though fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite,
hath some apprehension of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity:
and therefore nothing less
will satisfie it: the very negative
Knowledge therof doth forbid any
finite thing to be the adequate Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
of Man, whose vast and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:53793:13"/>
boundless Appetite exceedeth every
thing which hath bounds and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits,
and can swallow down the
whole World at one draught: like
the ut most Sphere, whose concavity
comprehendeth all things, and the
convexity thereof joyneth to an
endless immensity: though as Man
cannot directly and affirmatively
apprehend Infinity, so neither is he
capable of an Infinite Enjoyment:
yet the least defect or want of that
Infinite Good which he naturally
coveteth, being Infinite, doth more
unsatisfie then any finite delight can
content him: for so much as is
wanting of requisite Happiness, is
filled up with Vanity and Vexation.
All men have not a distinct appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension,
and explicite desire of an
Infinite Good, yet the same Instinct
being naturally in all, the Soul is
insensibly carryed out unto it, and
cannot finish the progress of her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire,
till she have gained that which
is beyond all apprehension, and all
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:53793:14"/>
desire. Vulgar spirits tasting some
drops of finite Goodness in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
Creatures, suppose that by an
endless multiplication of them they
shall at last attain that Infinite
Good which is the utmost object of
the Mind: and therefore never
cease adding House to House, Land
to Land, and World to World, and
so think to piece up an Infinite
Good with an endless variety of
finite Good things: though the
more they have, the more they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitely
desire, as drawing neerer
toward an Infinite Good, which is
that endless end to which they are
implicitely tending. Others through
their boundless Lusts, and vast Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations
fansie to themselves some
kind of Infinity, or at least a Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of rest, in the finite Objects of
their particular desires; thinking if
they may accomplish some petty
design, to which they are wholly
devoted, that then they shall be
perfectly Happy; and flattering
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:53793:14"/>
themselves like the Yong man in
the Comedy, who boasted, if he
might but enjoy his Mistress, <hi>Ipsam
fortunam anteibo fortunis meis.</hi>
Hence the Mind of Man while it is
in the pursute thereof, and hath any
farther expectation whereon to
feed, goes on cheerfully and with
much delight, hunting after this
shadow of fansied felicity: but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
once arrived at the utmost Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod,
is soon confuted by its own
Experience, and the vehemence of
this vast Appetite suddenly lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishes,
and the Soul shrinks up,
and pines away in shame and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content.
There is many a petty Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser,
who takes more pleasure in mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplying
a few pence, then if he had
been born Heir of the whole
Earth. There is more ravishing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in wooing, and courting, and
the Romances of Love before En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment
then after. Give a <hi>Pyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhus</hi>
the Empire of the whole world
at once, and you undo him. The
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:53793:15"/>
Game is more pleasing to such Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors,
then both the Stakes without
it. Hence also is that common and
naturall affectation of Novelty:
because the Mind being unsatisfied
with any thing it hath already, still
coveteth more. New things please
at first, but are afterward found to
be as vain as the rest. But as no fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
thing can fully satisfie the
Mind of Man, so it is most evident
that no multiplication of finites can
make up an infinite: for all the
Parts being finite and numerable,
the whole must necessarily be finite
also. Therefore it must be One In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
Good, in the Enjoyment
whereof the true Happiness of Man
doth consist, and which as the Chief
Good renders all those finite things
Good by a subordination to it self,
as the utmost End. This was the
chief study of all the ancient Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers,
to find out the Chief
Good: and by their severall opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
concerning it, they were distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:53793:15"/>
into their severall Sects. It
is the Elixar of Life, the true Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers
stone, which infuses a
Golden tincture into all inferior
Metalls, and cures all the diseases of
the Soul, by reducing it to a right
temper. <hi>Solomon</hi> hath discovered it
to the World: a Work worthy of
a King, not only of <hi>Israel,</hi> but of
the whole Earth, being so profitable
a Good to all Mankind. Great Wits
bewail the loss of his Naturall Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,

which is the Perfection of all the

whom God and Man had prepared
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:53793:16"/>

great Estate, and have got more
Wisdom then all that have been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
me in Ierusalem: yea my heart
had great experience of Wisdom and
Knowledge: and I gave my heart to
know Wisdom: and to know madness
and folly.</hi> The felicity of <hi>Augustus</hi>
was purchased, but <hi>Solomons</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary.
He was the Son of King
<hi>David,</hi> and came to a great Estate
in the early Spring of his Youth, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soon
as he was capable of enjoying
it. His Father left him a greater
Treasure then any History can pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralell:
and his Empire extended it
self from the border of <hi>Egypt</hi> to
the River <hi>Euphrates,</hi> a morsell suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
for any one mans mouth, if
any thing might suffice. Thus were
all things ready for this great work
brought to his hand, and while he
like the <hi>Halcyon</hi> was bringing it
forth, the silent alm of undisturbed
Peace seemed purposely to favor
the Design. As his Materials, so his
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:53793:17"/>
Wisdom and Skill of using them
was not acquired by labor and
long study, but given by speciall In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration.
He was wiser then all the
Kings and Philosophers in the
world. Nor was he of a severe and
Stoical temper, as <hi>Cat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

a most criticall palat and curious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
of all humane delights, and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
exercised it in tasting them.
<hi>Whatsoever his eyes desired he kept it
not from them, nor witheld his heart
from any joy, for his heart rejoyced in
all his labors,</hi> yea he laid hold on
Madness and Folly, that so he might
squeez out all the juyce and sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
that is in them. He went so far
as to try what was in the mad Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors
and Follies of Jo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>all men:
only he was not enchanted with
this Circean cup, but the <hi>Moli</hi> of
his Wisdom remained with him: so
that he was most fitly instructed to
make both the Search and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port.
And least men should dream
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:53793:17"/>
of any Golden Age before him, or
any new Inventions, and Sophisms
of Cookery, or Engines of Pleasure
since his time, he prevents the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
and tels us, <hi>That which is
done, is that which shall be done, and
there is no new thing under the Sun.</hi>
The Earth affords the same provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and Man is endued with the
same Senses and Faculties to make
use of them: and though some new
thing may be added, it is of the
same kind with the former; and
there being such a Vanity in the
whole frame of Nature, it must cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
be as vain as the rest. As for
his own part he knew how to enjoy
as much in one Age as any, <hi>and none
can hasten more then he.</hi> Thus having
ascended the highest <hi>Olympus</hi> of
earthly felicity, and viewing all
things, both before, and behind, and
round about him, he proclaims to
all below, who might suppose him
to have attained the very Heaven
of Happiness, that he found nothing
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:53793:18"/>
but empty air. <hi>Vanity of Vanities,
all is Vanity.</hi> For weighing the Pains
of Mans Life with the Pay, and his
Miseries with his Pleasures, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth
there is nothing to be got by
the bargain: So that he praised the
Dead more then the Living, and the
Unborn then them both. Lastly,
that all men might for ever despair
of finding any such Happiness in
this World, he averreth the Vanity
thereof to be so great, and so far
from being filled, that it cannot be
fathomed. <hi>That which is crooked
cannot be made straight, and that
which is wanting cannot be numbred.</hi>
Wherefore not to believ him who
hath made such a perfect Inquiry, is
of all Vanities the greatest, and
addeth Vexation to it, which he
shall never want, who seeks that
which cannot be found: whereas a
sober acknowledgement of this Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
may prevent the Vexation.
Content is the Deputy of outward
felicity, and supplies the place
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:53793:18"/>
where its absent. The first step to
true Happiness is to see the vanity of
all worldly things: that so knowing
where it is not, we may seek it
where it is.</p>

of the Solar light: or as the meanest
members of the Body are in man
the instruments of a Rational life,
which in a carcase are Dead, and in
beasts meerly Sensual. Thus the very
reliques of Nature may be rightly
enjoyed, as partaking of the Chief
Good and in order to it, though
none of them do now retain their
first Perfection. And indeed it is
folly and madness in any man to
neglect the least and meanest Good
which God and Nature have provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
for him. We will begin with
the Goods of the Body, as the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
of all. The Body, though not
at all allied to the Soul, yet is mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:53793:19"/>
to it, and brings some Portion
along with it. It is reported of
<hi>Apollonius Tyaneus</hi> that he had a
familiar Spirit ingaged in a Jewell:
such is the Soul of man in the Body:
by which conjunction he becomes a
Little World, not only as a Map or
<hi>Index,</hi> but as an <hi>Epitome</hi> of the
whole: whereby he is made capable
of enjoying all in himself, differing
from the Angels in his Body, as
from Beasts in his Soul: For An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical
Spirits enjoy no sensible
pleasures, otherwise then by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual
speculation, their nature
being far above them: Whereas
man enjoyes them by sense and
experience in his Body and sensitive
part, which is connatural unto them.
Not that we may flatter our selvs,
and prefer our natures before the
Angelical, or disparage our hope of
a more glorious state when we shall
be like unto the Angels, but onely
to assert our present nature and
conjunct state, which is made up of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:53793:20"/>
the meanest parts of the Body as
well as of the highest faculties of the
Soul: and as Soul and Body do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
together, so may the delights of
the one with the pleasures of the
other. But no bodily good can pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
be the highest Happiness or
Chief good of Man: For though
the Body contain the Soul, yet it
cannot fill it, no not the Body of
the whole Universe. To prove Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
delights far greater and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then Corporeal, we need not the
authority of a <hi>Solomon,</hi> we have the
confession of a <hi>Iulian,</hi> though an
Apostate from the true Happiness of
the Soul; yet he professed the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of the Body, far below a great
Spirit. Apostates of all other men
most strictly embrace this present
world, and study to extract the
greatest sweetness it can afford, their
desires being greatly enlarged with
the tast which they had of the Chief
good, and they have reason to do
so, for at the best they make but a
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:53793:20"/>
bad bargain: but all fall not in the
same manner, some fall forward
with their faces toward the earth
and wallow in the mire of sensuall
uncleanness, as <hi>Nicholas</hi> the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine
and his beastly Sect: others of
a more generous and sublime Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
by supine gazing on the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
from which they fell, and bark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at the Stars which they left fixed
in their Orbs, such were <hi>Lucian,
Iulian,</hi> and the Devils. It seems
Spiritual wickedness is most sublime
and delightful, much more Spiritual
virtues and graces, which are the
proper perfections of the Soul.
<hi>Averroes</hi> and the rest of the <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bian</hi>
Philosophers are ashamed of
that sensual and beastly Paradise
which their <hi>Mahomet</hi> provided for
them, as most unworthy of the soul
of Man, and far short of his true
Happiness.</p>

Of Health.</head>
               <p>HEalth is the temperate Zone
or habitable part of Mans
Life. As sleep is the image of
Death, so is sickness of Hell, being
rightly termed a Dying Life, whereof
Death many times is the sole Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian.
Many Princes dwell in stately
Palaces, whose souls are ill seated in
Cadaverous bodies. Health is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
the Peasants prerogative
which no riches can purchase of him:
whereas if he could be bought out
of it, he might sell it at the dearest
rates: what would not a rich man
give to another to undertake the
pain of the Stone or Gout for him,
could they be laid upon others as
outward burdens and labors are?
Health in Great men is a great
advantage. <hi>Henry the fourth of
France</hi> was bred hardly among the
Peasants, which preserved his life,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:53793:21"/>
and prepared him for those great
Actions, which he afterward per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.
<hi>Cicero</hi> reporteth of one
of the <hi>Scipio's,</hi> that he had equalled
<hi>Africanus,</hi> if he had not been kept
under by perpetual sickness<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Besides,
health is the very Paradise of all Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual
Pleasures in which they grow
and flourish: yet Courtiers usually
corrupt it by a licentious course of
life, and so disable both Body and
Mind, not only for the performing
of Civill Actions, but also for the
enjoying of Naturall Pleasures
which they so much affect. So un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
is the vice of voluptuousness
that it destroyeth Health, which is
its own foundation. As Health
consists in Temperament, so the best
way to preserve it is Temperance.
Diseases caused by emptiness may
be more dangerous, but there is
more danger in exceeding. Hence
are most of our vulgar sicknesses,
Feavers, Pests, Catarrhs, and Coughs,
the Trumpeters of Death. Violence
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:53793:22"/>
and excess may be good Physike, but
are bad Diet, unless we dare ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
on them, as <hi>Mithridates</hi> used
Poison, to fortifie our selvs against
casual extremities. But a sober and
discreet mixture of both seems most
conform to the various occasions
of life. The Ecclesiastical Order
was to fast the Eve before a Feast;
but the Physical rule holds as well
afterward till it be digested; and
the best kind of fasting is to eat a
little. Excess of Affections, especially
Malignant, as Fear, Grief, Envy, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,
and all Anxiety of mind, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyes
the body more then that of
Food: but delightful objects and
pleasant studies are the minds Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations.
Keep both Body and
Mind clean and fresh, freeing them
from all burdensom and offensive
things. But <hi>Tiberius</hi> his Aphorism,
That every man is his own best Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician
is worth all others, being most
true as to the preservation of the
ordinary state of Health, though not
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:53793:22"/>
in extraordinary cases, or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grown
Diseases, which must be help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the hand of Art; Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
first founded the Art of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sike,
and no Experience like that
within a mans self: and <hi>Tiberius</hi>
his life set a <hi>Probatum est</hi> to his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorism,
for though he was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
most licentious and libidinous,
yet he preserved himself in good
health to a reasonable old age, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
seventy and eight years. He
was indeed of a strong constitution,
but we find the same effect in men
very crazy and more sober, as <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates,
Galen,</hi> and others, who
first studied their own cases, and
thence became most eminent Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians:
Though Health be very
pretious, yet it may be overvalued;
some are so curious of it that they
fear the least blast and shadow of
Inconvenience, as he who imagined
himself made all of Glass and was
afraid lest every knock should break
him; whereas indeed this tender
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:53793:23"/>
niceness is rather a destroier then a
preserver of Health. <hi>Caesar</hi> by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall
imployment and hard usage
overcame two constant Diseases,

and many in our late Wars, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
were thought weak and infirm,
being put upon Service and the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of suffering, have proved
able and hardy beyond expectation.
However health must be adventured
as well as life, <hi>Pro salute publicae.
Pompey</hi> said, <hi>Necesse est ut eam non
ut vivam,</hi> when the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
was concerned. He who
makes health his chief good and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most

live, and prolongs his time to no

               <head>VII.
Of Strength.</head>
               <p>STrength is the Issue Male of
Health, and Beauty the Female;
the conjunction of both is very
rare and the perfection of Hero's.
We will speak of them severally.
There are two kinds of Strength, one
of Acting, the other of Enduring.
The former is the meniall servant of
a Mans self, and he who is not his
own best Man, is his slaves slave, and
a voluntary Criple. There are many
offices of life which cannot hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somly
be performed by others, as
necessary Actions, and all Exercises.
The manner of the <hi>Turks</hi> to sit on
Carpets shooting their Arrows, and
have their slaves fetch them, is an
unmanly Exercise. Some are so vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
idle, that they commit the very
dressing &amp; undressing of themselvs
to their servants, which is a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manish
Fashion; there may be
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:53793:24"/>
some state in it, but certainly no
convenience. A small competency
of Strenght sufficeth for common
Actions, and Agility serveth the
turn better then Robust Force. Gross
and fat bodies are more strong in
their Center, but have a less Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
or Sphere of activity, being
burdens to the earth and themselvs:
Light and nimble bodies, though of
less Strength, have more<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> use and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment
of it. The want of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
proportion of ordinary
Strength, renders the Body more
infirm and defective then any extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
measure thereof can ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
in happiness: for even in
those things, whereof there can be
no excess, and so a mediocrity can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be the perfection, yet it is the
Center and hart of the whole. It
may seem strange that Strength
should be increased by sickness and
distemper, which is an Infirmity, as
in Feavers, Madness, Anger, yea
sometimes by fear it self. But this
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:53793:24"/>
Strength arising from a sudden con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flux
of spirits is not solid and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent,
consisting rather in a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
quickness then in a constant
endeavour; and this extraordinary
expence of spirits ends afterward
in a greater weakness. Besides, in
Man there may be another reason
more strange then the former, which
is, that the mind by doubting and
disputing gives a check to the full
&amp; free delivery of Bodily Strength
(whereas in such cases Reason is
suspended) and the same power
doth many times effect that by a
nimble impulse, which it could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
do by a dull contention. Prudent
Caution is an hindrance in Action,
yet in that it prevents the occasion
it is better then Strength, the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
whereof betrays us to Duels
and Dangers. The other which is
the Strength of Bearing is as neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
in the life of man as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
yea in all bodily action there
is some striving and suffering, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:53793:25"/>
if there be a want of natural
ability. Lameness adds pain to
weakness, and a crooked back is its
own burden. A hardy carcase is a
strong Brest-work or Fortification
to the soul: Hardiness in the one
being analogous to Patience in the
other, yea the former facilitates the
latter, and many times saves it the
labor. No Bodily Suffering in this
life can be extream, for when it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth,
nature yieldeth and giveth
up the Ghost, and as long as she af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordeth
strength it is baseness not to
bear. He who inures his Body to
Suffering beforehand, hath so much
the less to endure afterward, so that
it comes not upon him all at once.
But Mans Happines cannot consist in
Bodily Strength, it being not seat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in his Spiritual, but in his Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real
part. Reason, as hath been
shewed, may hinder Strength by
Caution and declination, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
back it with a good Resolution,
and wisely manage it with Discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:53793:25"/>
but adds no sensible for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e to
it: Nor doth the mind act its own
body as an Angel doth an assumed
carcase. Yet hath Nature armed
man with such a proportion of
Strength, by which, with the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of his Wit he is able to tame
or subdue any Beast, at School-play,
as we say, with Instruments and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines,
though not by downright
Blows. Thus I esteem <hi>Archimedes</hi>
a stronger man then <hi>Milo,</hi> for he
by his Engines could perform far
more then the other by his Arms:
and so was <hi>Caesar</hi> a greater Souldier
then either <hi>Hercules</hi> or <hi>Achilles,</hi>
really effecting greater things by a
wise conduct of his affairs then are
fabled of the others: and perhaps
the Monopoly of Gun-powder
when it was first invented might
have effected more then them all,
and conquered the whole World.
As for this strength of enduring,
Man hath naturally less of it then
most of Beasts, not only as he is
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:53793:26"/>
more tenderly bred, and his Body
mollified with warm clothing, but
in his very constitution, being more
infirm in his Infancy, and more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crepit
in his Old Age.</p>

            <div n="8" type="part">
               <head>VIII.
Of Beauty.</head>
               <p>STrength is a Tyrant, but Beauty
a naturall and lawfull Prince,
born to reign, as the Philosopher
observeth. There is a kind of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
Magike in it which bewitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
us we know not how; as inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
<hi>Xenophon</hi> in the person of
<hi>Critobulus</hi> elegantly expresseth it.
The very first sight and presence of
it attracteth the eies of every be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder,
like the sudden appearance
of a Candle in a dark room. It is
the most excellent Object of the
most excellent Sense, the darling of
Fansy, which tradeth in Images and
<hi>Idea's</hi> within, and meeting with such
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:53793:26"/>
curious pieces abroad entertaineth
them with great delight. And if it
were true, that the Soul is the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitect
of its own Body (as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
the Body is prepared and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for the Soul) it were a very
good reason why it should so much
delight in the beautiful composure
of anothers Body, which it intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in its own: as an Artist is much
affected with any excellent Work of
the same kind. This <hi>Venus</hi> of
Beauty is the Mother of vulgar
Love, and so also of that which
they call Heroicall: though the
Graces attend her, and Virtue the
true Beauty of the soul bear her
company, yet she usually acts the
chief part in the Play, but alwaies
the first: the very Picture of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loclea</hi>
first enamoured <hi>Pyrocles. By
it,</hi> saith <hi>Siracides, Love is kindled as
with a flame.</hi> It is the chief ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
in Loves <hi>Philtrum,</hi> which so
much enchanteth the minds of men,
ravishing and transporting the soul,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:53793:27"/>
and putting it into a strange exta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy
of delight; and is indeed the
chief of all sensuall pleasures, the
inmost Bower in Fools Paradise, as
<hi>Ausonius</hi> describeth it,
<q>Myrtrus amentes ubi lucus opa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat
Amantes.</q>
where they live together in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
shade of wanton Vanity and
pleasing Madness. Surely this most
generous and glorious Affection
was never intended by God and
Nature for so mean an Object, nor
for any created excellency, but for
him who is the Beauty of all Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
to whom <hi>Solomon</hi> in his <hi>Canti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi>
doth rightly apply it, and the
blessed Spirits in Heaven perfectly
exercise and enjoy it in their Beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficall
Vision. But vain men having
set their hearts upon an Earthly
Beauty, Idolize it with a Divine
Love; and we may observ them in
their courting and dallying, still to
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:53793:27"/>
run out into Deifying Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and Divine Adoration:
which plainly shews that the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Instinct and Inclination of Love
ascends toward a Divinity, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thus debased by Lust, is prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally
spent upon an inferior Object.
Yet this created Beauty is a chief
excellency of Nature, and a Beam of
that Infinite Brightness. As the
erect Posture of Mans Body, so his
Face, which is the chief part thereof,
being composed of greater variety
of curious Lineaments, and fairer
Colors, is more excellent then any
Beasts, Generally all kind of Beauty
is of great esteem. In building or
furnishing of an House, the Show
and Sight cost as much as Conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency.
In Apparell, Fashion and
Comeliness are as dear as Usefulnes.
Handsomeness in an Horse doth as
much advance his price, as Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
In Civill conversation, <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosa
facies muta commendatio est,</hi>
bespeaking and gaining favor and
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:53793:28"/>
good will, which is no small advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
in humane affairs, and certainly
the greatest of worldly comforts.
<hi>Absolom</hi> gained much upon the
People by his Beauty. It preferred
<hi>Alcibiades</hi> to the love and care of
his Master <hi>Socrates.</hi> It endeareth
Children to their own Parents, and
is many times a sufficient Portion in
Marriage. It prevails much by its
own proper authority, but is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
setter off to great For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,
and true Virtues; as Varnish
to Colors, or the refraction of
Light upon Metals. But the vanity
thereof doth sufficiently appear in
it self, being but a meer <hi>Superficies</hi>
of the Body, which is the far meaner
part of Man, and not so much as
skin deep, as some allow it, for turn
the skin outward, and it will appear
to be the Reverse of all Beauty, and
a most horrid Spectacle of Bloud
and Rawness: So that indeed this
beautifull Idoll is not much more
then the reflection of it from the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:53793:28"/>
Glass, which is but a meer <hi>Spectrum</hi>
or Shadow. Either Beauty is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
excellency, or rather Fansy,
which is the Judge thereof, is such a
wanton Spirit, that it is not alwaies
constant to it self; for it is not only
variously apprehended by severall
men, as it is said the <hi>Aethiopians</hi>
paint the Devill white: but the same
persons at severall times variously
judge of it. The <hi>Persians</hi> highly
esteemed an Hawk-Nose, because
their <hi>Cyrus</hi> was so shaped. <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>
Courtiers wried their Necks
like him, and the <hi>Roman</hi> Ladies affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
the color of <hi>Poppaea's</hi> Hair.
The <hi>Irish</hi> do the like: and we alter
the cut of our Heads and Beards al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
every year, and I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded,
if it were as much in our
power, we should have as many new
fashions and changes of our Bodies
as we have of our Garments and At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tires.
But whatsoever the true va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
of Beauty may be, surely the
owner enjoyeth it only at the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:53793:29"/>
hand, either from the Glass, as
the Flower thereof, or from the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor
of others, which is the best Fruit
it yieldeth.</p>

Of the Goods of Fortune.</head>
               <p>THE Gifts of Fortune are the
Good things of the great Body
of the World: and are of three
sorts, Riches, Objects of Pleasure,
and Titles of Honor: which one
rightly terms the Worlds Trinity.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Ambitiosus Honos, &amp; Opes, &amp;
Foeda Voluptas,</l>

habet.</l>
               </q>
               <p>These three make up the whole
Inventory of Fortune, and are all
summed up in a Crown, or the Roi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
State, which the Heathen called
the fairest Gift that the Gods be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:53793:29"/>
on mortall men. Besides it
hath a peculiar Prerogative, which is,
that Grandeur or Supremacy, which
we commonly call <hi>Majesty,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
no inferior condition is capable.
Princes are in this sense more then
men, Political Giants, like <hi>Briareus</hi>
having an hundred hands, yea thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands,
and millions of hands, with
all which they act good or ill. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gum
ingenia sunt fata temporum.</hi>
We cannot well discourse of the
goods of Fortune without this,
which is the greatest of all, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is the summary of them,
eminently including all in it self, we
will particularly insist on it, not as
a Civill Institution, though of the
best kind, but as a Personal Felicity;
which is so great and so much admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by other men, that the labour
lies most on the other hand to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate
the Vanity thereof. The
World hath always declaimed
against usurping Tyrants, and
Philosophers have as much cried
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:53793:30"/>
down their happiness. They are
Kings of a Bastard kind, which yet
commonly afterward obtain a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimation.
Certainly Tyranny,
even in lawfull Princes, is as great
a misery to themselvs as to the
people. It is the happiness of Christ's
Kingdom, <hi>That his people shall be
willing in the day of his power.</hi> The
love of the Subjects makes Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty
pleasant, without which
it is like the Kingdom of Satan, a
very Hell of Disorder and Discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.
All men admire a Crown,
because they see the lustre, but feel
not the weight of it; this seems
lighter, because they never wore it,
and that greater then it is, because
they cannot wear it: we naturally
admire that which we cannot attain
as well as that which we cannot un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,
looking upon it as Pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
and Sacred. Therefore it is a
very hard thing to give a clear de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration
of the Vanity of this
opinion, which cannot be confuted
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:53793:30"/>
by experience. The <hi>Spanish</hi> Page,
who in a high distemper of Fansy
imagined himself a great Emperor,
and was maintained in that Humor
by his Lord, had some kind of tast
thereof. The Scripture expresseth
the greatest Glory and Pomp of
Princes in no better a Phrase then,
<hi>Much Fansy:</hi> There are some more
reall tasts of Royalty, which any
private man may have. Every Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of a Family is a King within
doors. The best pedigree of law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Monarchy is from it, and Princes
still affect to be called Fathers of
the Country. Though Families are
subordinate to Kingdoms, yet it is
true of Kingdoms as well as of
them, <hi>Omne sub regno graviore
regnum est:</hi> the greatest Potentates
are not Omnipotent, but as much
crossed in their wills as others, who
as they have lesser Abilities, so they
have lower Designs. Thus may pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
men <hi>Degustare Imperium,</hi> even
that Empire which is without them,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:53793:31"/>
and over others, but certainly every
man may be <hi>Rex Stoicus,</hi> a King in
his own Microcosm: which he who
knows how to rule well, may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise
a Crown. But the most satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory
Evidence is that which may
be collected from Princes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selvs,
especially such who have had
the experience of a Private life, and
so can best judge of both. Such
commonly prove the ablest and the
wisest, enjoying and improving Roi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty
to the utmost. <hi>Sylla</hi> the Happy
laid aside his Dictatorship, because
he esteemed a Private life more
Happy. <hi>Augustus</hi> was partly of
the same mind, and deliberated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
it, but not so confident. As
<hi>Periander</hi> said of Tyranny, It was a
hard thing to keep, and dangerous
not to keep. Our common saying is
very true, That the best Condition
of life, is between a Constable and
a Justice of Peace, if the Constable
and the Justice would support such
in that middle estate: but common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:53793:31"/>
men in Office take a pride and a
delight in oppressing Private men:
they think Justice but an ordinary
and dull thing, Injustice is more
eminent and extraordinary: so that
many wise men, who would fain
live quietly, are necessitated to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
of Authority, and part with
some of their Happiness to secure
the rest. Yet <hi>Dioclesian,</hi> though he
judged it absolutely necessary to
continue the Empire, voluntarily
left it, and would never after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>assume
it, though he were highly
threatned to it. In <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi>
himself, who professed it his Chief
Good to be Chief, <hi>Insultare omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um
capitibus,</hi> and had rather be the
best man in a Parish, as we say, then
second in the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> yea,
was not contented with the Thing,
unless he might also have the Name
of a King (which partly intimates
the Vani<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

addicted to either of them, but hath
placed them among his greatest
pleasures: Now the one being the
naturall pleasure of the Body, and
the other of the Mind, a common
Plebeian may enjoy both as fully as
any of them. What shall we then
say of Fidling, and Fooling, and
the vain Humors of weaker Princes?
Surely a wise man would judge a

of those yong <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors.</p>

Of Riches.</head>
               <p>MOney is the eldest Son and
Heir of Fortune, Lord Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount,
and universall King in every
particular Kingdom. The Image
and Superscription of <hi>Caesar</hi> on his
Coin is more powerfull then <hi>Caesar</hi>
himself. Witty men have many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited
disparagements of it, calling
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:53793:32"/>
it, The Excrement of Earth, Metall
turned up Trump, and the like:
but they speak of it in its Naturall
capacity, whereas they ought to
consider it in its Politike, as Money,
and not at Metall: &amp; so it is rightly
defined, the Measure of all commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
things. In this sense <hi>Petronius</hi>
calls it, <hi>Iovem in arca:</hi> and they
who profess an absolute contempt
of it, must also despise all externall
things, whereof it is the price and
value: and without a competency
whereof the outward Man cannot
be maintained: for particular men
having impropriated all the Good
things of the World necessary for
the life of Man, they will be left in
a worse condition then Brute
Beasts, who are either nourished by
Men, or may Forrage for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selvs.
Wherefore leaving such who
have Bodies, and yet despise the
means of preserving them, to feed
on their airy notions, we will dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
of the severall Estates and
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:53793:33"/>
Revenues of others who too much
admire them, and show what Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
every Degree and <hi>Census</hi> of
them may contribute to the life of
Man. The first sort are such as have
all their Estates in their own Hands,
that is, live upon their daily labors,
being slaves to every man who will
hire them: which is a condition al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
as servile as to be enslaved to
one proper Master, the one being
of Necessity, as the other of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsion.
For this reason the <hi>Iews</hi>
generally refuse even Mechanicall
Trades, as bordering upon the same
inconvenience, and are commonly
either Merchants or Physicians. Yet
this mean Condition hath a blessing
in it, for as such are sure never to
gain much, so they are sure never to
want much, so long as Health and
Strength last. Rich men need their
Labors as much as they need their
Riches. An able Body may well
earn its own Living. The second
sort is of them whose Revenues are
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:53793:33"/>
sufficient to maintain them in a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
and free kind of life, or at
least so as they may command Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and need not be commanded
by it, taking as much or as little
thereof as they please; which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
it the best of Recreations, and
takes off the Burden and wearisom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of it. This sort of men, though
not the richest, may live as happily
as any, if they do not wrong them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selvs
by covetous Desires, or too
pressing Emploiments. The last are
such as have an Excessive and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous
Estate, which as it is a great
advantage of doing Liberall and
Magnificent things, so it is a very
great tentation, not only to Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
but also to Luxury and Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality.
A great Estate, without
great Abilities to manage it, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be improved to the hight in the
right use of it, but that the greatest
part of the Water will run beside
the Mill: on the one hand Vain
Company, Parasiticall Servants,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:53793:34"/>
French Cooks and Tailors, Game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
Usurers, and such Birds of
prey will devour most of it: on the
other hand Covetousness will rust
it, and bury it like a hid Treasure or
Talent in the ground. Of all three
the middle is the safest, and <hi>Agars
Dimensum</hi> the best, if a man can
think so as he did. Yet the highest
Degree of an inferior Rank doth
not only excell in the same, but is
more valuable in the true Accompt
of Estates, then the lowest Degree
of an higher Rank. As for example,
A rich Yeoman if he turn Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
may be a poor and mean Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,
and a rich Gentleman
made a Lord, may be a poor and
mean Lord, not only in the Estimate
of Honor, for that is another consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
but even in this Accompt
of Riches, with relation to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of Honor, for the Estate must
alwaies hold a proportion with the
State and Port which a man bears.
Again, the Rates of particular things
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:53793:34"/>
are wisely to be considered, as well
as the quality of Estates in generall.
The first consideration to be had in
Expence, is of things Necessary, as
of Food, Raiment, and the like.
<hi>Diogenes</hi> wondered that a Statue
should be sold for more then a
bushell of Wheat. The second is of
things Usefull and Convenient. It
is very ill Husbandry to want any
cheap conveniencies, and it is far
better laying out money upon small
Wares of daily use, then upon cost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Trifles. To want a good Book, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is somwhat dear according
to the rate of Printing, or not to
have the best advise in a Case of
Physike or Law, because it may cost
a little more, is foolish; for such
Intellectuall things are worth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
if they be not worth far more
then they cost. The last considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is of Ornament and Delight, as
Jewels, Flowers, Pictures, and such
like rarities of Nature or Art,
which are also valuable in their kind,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:53793:35"/>
and are commodities fit for super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous
Estates. Rich men seem pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely
to have inhanced the price
of them, that so they might have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
of laying out their great
Riches for themselvs, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
they could never spend in an
ordinary way. The Vulgar honor
Great men for those things, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
them according to the price
which is set upon them: but a Wise
man, who considers their true and
naturall worth, need not envy them
the Happiness of a fair Diamond, or
strange Tulip, or <hi>Michael Angelo's</hi>
Masterpiece. Or if these things be
so valuable, why should we not as
highly value such Ornaments of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
as cannot be bought for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney:
Beauty is a richer Ornament
then gorgeous Apparell, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet
Elegancy then great Cost.
When others presented <hi>Socrates</hi>
with their severall Gifts, poor <hi>Aes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chines</hi>
presented himself, and outvied
them all with a Complement.
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:53793:35"/>
Credit and Reputation are the
greatest Expenditors, Garbs and
Fashions of Apparell, Sumptuous
Entertainments, the Pomp of Festi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals
and Funerals, and the like,
which are the Customes of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
are more chargable then the
Customes and Imposts of Princes.
The bravest Minds could be content
with the lest, but they stand upon
their Honor, and others make them
pay for it. The strangest Humor is
of the Covetous, who least need
Money, and yet most affect it, and
of Prodigalls, who most need it,
and least regard it. The way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
both, is so to spend, as a man
may continue spending through the
whole course of his Life, and leav to
his to spend after him. The first is a
Debt which he owes to Himself, the
second to Posterity. But no Money
can purchase true and perfect Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness,
because it trades only in the
Market of things commutable, and
cannot buy out the proper Goods
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:53793:36"/>
either of Body or Mind. <hi>Crassus</hi>
counted him a Rich man who could
maintain an Army with his own
Revenues: and indeed he spake the
most of Riches, for he who hath an
Estate to keep an Army, may have
an Army to keep his Estate: yet we
have a sad Instance of the contrary
in the same man: for both he and
his great Army, with his Son and
Heir fell together, and left his
great Estate to others. The Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of such great Rich men in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
times, may teach us to despise
the poor Pedlers of our times, who
spend all their lives in gaining some
few Thousands, and when they have
scraped together all they can, dy
Beggers in comparison of a <hi>Crassus,</hi>
or a <hi>Seneca:</hi> and so are defeated of
their chiefest ambition, which is to
be said to dy Rich.</p>

               <p>MOney is the Pandar of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
and Purveior generall
for the Flesh: as he said to his Soul,
<hi>Thou hast much Goods laid up for

of Pleasures Spirituall, which <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheus</hi>

is the reward of Virtue:</hi> and our
Wise man expresseth more soberly,
<hi>A Good Conscience is a continuall
Feast:</hi> but of those Pleasures to
which these Metaphors allude: not
as they are the native Pleasures of
the Body, but the outward Objects
and Instruments thereof which the
World affords, and the Body uses;
the Divine Oracle tells us, <hi>There is
nothing better for a man, then that
he should eat, and drink, and make
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:53793:37"/>
his Soul enjoy good in his labor.</hi> Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
is the Pay of Nature, which
turns Work it self into Sport: Yet
there are are some strange Spirits,
who seek to put off their own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and are displeased with the
very Pleasures thereof, differing
from other men, as though they
were Creatures of another <hi>Species.</hi>
Such were some of the ancient Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers,
who affecting to be sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
&amp; supervulgar, and taking ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of the common inclination
to Excess in Pleasures, resolved upon
the contrary Extreme, that so others
being conscious to themselvs of their
own Infirmity, might admire them as
more then Men. But it is a great
and universall Error to admire
things for their difficulty and rarity
rather then value them according
to their true worth: We are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
so fond of this Humor, that if
we do but hear of any strange
thing, we love to enlarge it, and act
it in Buskins. Difficulty seems to
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:53793:37"/>
add the honor of a Miracle, which
is Sacred and Religious: but such
are the Miracles of Juglers and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanters,
whereas all Gods Miracles
are of great use and efficacy. There
are difficult trifles and difficult vices.
To starv a mans self is as sinfull as it
is difficult. It hath been the practice
of Superstitious persons in all Ages
to torture themselvs like <hi>Baals</hi>
Priests: as though to destroy or
wrong Nature, were to worship the
God of Nature, <hi>Who will have Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and not Sacrifice;</hi> Mercy to our
selvs, as well as to others. It is true,
there is Spirituall Physike as well as
Naturall: but neither Feasting nor
Fasting are a Christians constant
Diet. Discreet Sobriety is the best
use of Nature, not only most whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some,
but also most pleasant, Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
is the best Sawce: for it sawceth
the Palat, as others do the Meat:
and the reducing of our Stomach to
our Diet, yields more sweetness and
delight, then the fitting of our Diet
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:53793:38"/>
to our Stomach. The first exhalati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Corporeall Spirits are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
freshest and quickest: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we should never set our Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
on tilt, nor jade our Recreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
<hi>Too much Honey is not good.</hi>
Surfetting is ever nauseous and cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous,
and so a forfeiture of that
Pleasure wherein it exceedeth. The
best way of enjoying Pleasures, is
fairly and soberly to entertain them
when they offer themselvs, not
Gnathonically to hunt after them,
or feed on them with longing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
which cannot be satisfied. Thus
a sober man may enjoy more even of
those outward Pleasures then all the
mad <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors: and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
they did over-run the purest
part of Pleasure by cloying their
Appetite, and dulling the Relish
thereof, and therefore invented
new prodigious Pleasures, as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
satisfied with naturall and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary.
As a Bear is mad after Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
so some men, by reason of their
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:53793:38"/>
naturall Constitution, or unnaturall
Lusts, are so madly set upon some
particular Pleasures, that whensoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the Objects thereof are present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unto them, they cannot possibly
forbear, prostituting Fame, and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
Reason, Religion, and all to
their foolish Fansies and vain De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires.
The Vanity of all these world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Pleasures appears in this, that if
they be strong and quick, they are
very short, and if they last longer,
they are very dull: and the Griefs
and Miseries to which we are all
subject, are far greater in proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
then our Pleasure. A Fit of the
Stone or Gout puts us into an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasy
of Pain, more acute and lasting
then the greatest ravishments of any
bodily Pleasures: nor was ever such
an Instrument of Pleasure invented,
as the Rack, the Cross, the <hi>Persian</hi>
Boat, the Bull of <hi>Phalaris,</hi> were ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
and tormenting. Many Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
are very shamefull, but all have
something of Levity in them, which
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:53793:39"/>
is expressed by our Laughing, Play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Dallying, and the like relaxati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Body or Mind. This shows
that we should only use them as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations,
and not make them our
constant Business, or Course of Life.</p>

Of Honor.</head>
               <p>HOnor moves in an higher
Sphere then Pleasure, and
commonly Retrograde to it: For
Honor consists in Action, but Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
in Recreation. Honor is the
price or value of any thing set upon
it by God or Man. Every Creature
is Gods Coin, and he hath stamped
upon it the valuation of that worth
and excellency which is in it, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to that <hi>Classis</hi> in which it is
ranked, and the particular Eminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of it in its own Kind. This is
<hi>Honor in honor abili,</hi> true naturall
Honor, though not honored by
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:53793:39"/>
men, as Beauty is truly beautifull,
though no Ey see it. The other is
Mans Estimate or Indication there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
which is <hi>Honor in honorante,</hi> and
this is the Honor whereof we now
speak, as one of the Goods of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.
Civill Honors are very neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
in a State, for thereby the State
it self becomes more Honorable, &amp;
more compact within it self, by an
orderly disposition of all the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
in their severall places and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees.
The <hi>Romans</hi> made the best
use of it of any State in the World.
They divided themselvs into three
sorts, <hi>Nobles, Knights, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi>
as their highest, middle, and
lowest Ranks: and all of them
were capable of most honorable
Emploiments and Offices of State;
so that they who were not born to
Honor, might acquire it, and they
who were might augment it; from
their Birth they were stiled <hi>Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,
Plebeian, Patrician,</hi> and the
like; from their Offices, <hi>Consular,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:53793:40"/>
Praetorian, Quaestorian, Senatorian,</hi>
and the like: from their Actions,
<hi>Triumphall, African, Asiatike, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the Country,</hi> and the like:
and though Titles of Honor were
not to be purchased for Money
among them, yet in their Censing
they had some consideration of
mens Estates: For he who well
husbandeth his private Estate doth
thereby enrich the Commonwealth,
and bears a greater share of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
Charge. Their Images or Arms
were not Ensigns of the Family, but
of the Person; and no man was
permitted to set up his own Image,
till he had ascended the Curule
Chair, which was a Personall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement.
Continuation of a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
race for many ages is a great
blessing of God upon it, and the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
of the Ancestor, an Heirlome
as due to the Posterity, as any Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norary
Estate annexed unto it, yet
certainly Personall Honor is the
worthier, and the best foundation
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:53793:40"/>
of the other; though that prevail
far more in the favor and opinion
of men; so that whereas New men
by their most honorable perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances
can hardly defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selvs
from contempt, Hereditary
Nobility is as hardly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> lost by the
greatest vices; Though the Law
and Princes who first bestowed it,
revoke it for Treason or other for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture
thereof, yet I know not how
something still sticks in the Minds of
men, and the Character of their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Nobility seems indeleble: so
Fatall is it to be born, or not to be
born of Great Parents in the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the world. The Case is the
same with that between Protestants
and Papists concerning Antiquity:
the Papists deduce it through many
Successions, but the Protestants de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
it from the first Originall. <hi>God
hath made us all of one Bloud,</hi> and
<hi>We are also his Off-spring,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend
from one common Ancestor.
But it must be so as the World will
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:53793:41"/>
have it, and wise men should not be
too Philosophicall herein; for it is
Politically good and usefull in the
generall, at least far better then a
confused equality. The best Rule
for all things of this nature, is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
greatly to affect them nor dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain
them. The greatest Happiness
of Honor is the favourable respect
and inclination of others, which of
all outward things, Honor and
Beauty, (the Escutcheon of Nature)
do most effectually procure; and
the Good will of men is a very
great Comfort, sweetning a mans
whole Life, and entertaining him in
all Companies; but the very same
thing sufficiently demonstrates the
Vanity thereof, that it is in the
power of others, whose Humors are
as inconstant as the Waves, and
their Breath as vain as the Winds.
The very Ensigns of Honor show
what it is; the <hi>Trophies, Banners,
Escutcheons Crests Pictures, Images,</hi>
and the like. <hi>Vespasian</hi> was tired
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:53793:41"/>
with a Triumph, the greatest solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
and show of Honor that ever
was instituted among men: and
certainly it could not but weary a
grave and wise man to be carried up
and down the Streets to make a
show to the People.</p>

and there have been some
such Monarchs of Learning, as
have been singularly excellent in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
all Arts and Sciences. <hi>Animus
cujusque est quisque:</hi> The Mind is
the Man. The <hi>Genius</hi> of a Wise
man seems to differ almost as much
from a Fools, as a Man doth from
a Beast. It is true, all souls are
equall in their Kind and Faculties<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
but certainly not in the degrees of
their Powers and Virtues. In Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
where the Spirits of just men
shall be made perfect, yet they
shall all differ one from another
in Glory, which is the perfection
of their Grace. <hi>Homo homini quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum
tum interest?</hi> and as the enjoiment
of the Chief Good is the proper
perfection of the Mind, so the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:53793:43"/>
or Baseness thereof is best
discovered by the higher or lower
moving thereof toward this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.
Some mens Minds are set
wholly upon drudging and moiling,
which is a condition not much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
Beasts. Others have a Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor
of Gaming, others of Dally<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Sporting, of Eating and
Drinking and making themselvs
Merry, such as think themselvs no
mean Fools, of making themselvs
Famous in the World, of Rising
higher and higher, like seeled Doves
they know not whither. Some of
Learning much, and Practising little;
some of Ruling others, and yet
neglect themselvs; others of Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
and Governing themselvs, and
yet neglect their Chief Good, which
is infinitely above themselvs, setting
up those inferior ends instead there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
Like <hi>Barclays Heraleon,</hi> we have
all some particular Madness and
private Fansy. It is commonly
said, that <hi>Men are twice Children,</hi>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:53793:43"/>
or rather the follies of Childhood
grow up into our whole life in
greater degrees &amp; more maturity.
The old Adage is very opposite,
<hi>Children play with Nuts, and elder
men with Oaths,</hi> then which no sport
can be more foolish and dangerous.
Thus do mens Ends and Aims dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
their Principles. The White
of the Ey and the White of the
Mark are tied together with a
direct Line. Every Creature in its
several kind hath a natural <hi>Acme</hi>
or Period of perfection to which it
tends, and which it endeavors to
attain with all the power and vigor
it hath, only Man degenerates into
lower and baser Ends then that
for which he was made, busying
himself about some particular De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,
and so goes on from one thing
to another, neglecting that highest
and chiefest Good, whereof he is
capable, which is the greatest Error
of Life, and brings upon him the
curse of <hi>Cain,</hi> rendring him a Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gabond
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:53793:44"/>
on the face of the Earth,
and makes him wander up and
down like a Begger, knocking at
every door, and crying out to every
Creature, <hi>Who will show us any
Good?</hi> Never thinking to gain this
setled Estate of Universall and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Happiness, which may supply all
his wants, and maintain him in a
State of perfect Felicity; but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
chuses to live miserably upon
the scraps of the Creatures, shark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and shifting as well as he may, to
support this frail life, and satisfy the
necessities thereof: and at last
wishes he may dy like a Beast, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
lived like a Beast, and made
no provision for an Eternal Life. The
Jewel of Mans true Happiness is to
be found in this Treasury of the
Mind, yet not among the inferior
and particular Goods thereof, but
in the fruition of the Chief and
Universal Good, without which all
the rest are vain, and of no value.</p>

Of Learning.</head>
               <p>THe first and lowest of the
Goods of the Mind, is Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or Speculative Knowledge, that
<hi>Pabulum Animae</hi> which never sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiates,
but is more increased by feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and not diminished by commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating.
No sort of men who
ever had any tast of Letters have
distasted or despised them; Whether
they have been Beggers or Kings;
as <hi>Diogenes,</hi> and <hi>Alexander;</hi> Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers,
or Scholars, as <hi>Aristippus</hi> and
<hi>Plato;</hi> Souldiers, or Gownmen, as
<hi>Caesar,</hi> and <hi>Cicero;</hi> Epicures or
Stoikes, as <hi>Horace,</hi> and <hi>Brutus;</hi>
Christians, or Heathens, as <hi>Paul</hi> and
the <hi>Athenians.</hi> The fame of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is far less then the inward plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
and delight thereof. <hi>Antisthenes</hi>
being asked what he gained by it,
answered, That he could talk with
himself, so that he needed not to
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:53793:45"/>
go abroad and be beholding to
others for exercise or delight. It is
no small Happiness to live comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
within doors: and to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
our selves with our own
Thoughts, being never less alone
then when we are alone. Intellectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
Contemplation is more pleasant
then Sight, and Generation of the
Mind then that of the Body. The
lowest and meanest part of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is, that which we commonly call
Pedantical, consisting in the forms
and Paedagogy of Art, as Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar
and all other Humane Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
though such be very usefull in
their kind, and may conduce much
toward that knowledge which is
Natural and Real, as being the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments
and vehicles thereof: yet
the Knowledg of the Things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selvs
being the End of them is far
more excellent: and the more or
less they contribute thereunto, they
are so much the more or less consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable.
The common Infirmity of
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:53793:45"/>
this kind of Learning is to be more
curious then needfull. What a
strange madness is it in our Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticasters
to trouble the world
with their diversity of opinions
concerning the right pronunciation
of an <hi>Iota,</hi> or the Orthography of
a word, as whether we should write
<hi>Foelix</hi> or <hi>Felix,</hi> rather then study<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to be so? Not much unlike is
the Humor of Critikes, who study
Cabalistical Interpretations of Clas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sike
Authors. The Fiction concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Grammarian is very witty
who consulted <hi>Homer</hi> in Hell why
he began his <hi>Ilias</hi> with <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and
he answers him, because it came
into his head to do so. Nor much
better is our too great affectation of
old and obsolete Languages: though
something may be pick'd out of
them: yet as there are some Mines
which have some Grains of Gold
in them, but so few that men think
it not worth their labor to extract
them: So in all those Studies, it is
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:53793:46"/>
first to be considered whether the
Profit will answer the Pains: cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
it is a great vanity to cry up
that for the only Learning, which
conduceth least to Practice, and the
true Happiness of Man, only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is rare and difficult. To
know that which few know, better
pleaseth and more advanceth Fame,
then to know that which all should
practice. This is that kind of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
which puffeth up rather then
edifieth: and you shall observ
generally a strange tumor in the
Professors thereof; like Courtiers
and men of Ceremony, who being
exactly curious in their Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and <hi>Puntilio's,</hi> which others
despise, and therefore neglect, think
themselvs the only Brave men. Next
above this kind of Learning is Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story,
or the Knowledge of former
Times and Actions of men, which
is very profitable, ripening and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
the Mind for Business, by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting
it with the greatest Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:53793:46"/>
of the World: yet there is
much Pedantry in the Study thereof,
where men are most curious in the
most inconsiderable passages and
circumstances, and most affected
with the antiquated pieces thereof,
seeking to set together some scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
fragments and remains which
are very uncertain and conjecturall,
&amp; such as Time, the best of Critikes,
hath resigned to Dust and Oblivion.</p>
               <p>The most excellent Learning is
the Study of Nature and the works
of God, of Morall Virtue, and
true Piety, and the like, which more
immediatly concern the Happiness
of Man: yet in those also there
may be as much Pedantry, and
more dangerous then the former:
when this Knowledge of Practical
things terminates only in Speculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Notion. There is nothing
more hurtfull to Man then such Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantical
Knowledge: it fills the
Head with Conceits and <hi>Caprichio's,</hi>
the Life with Fooleries and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malities,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:53793:47"/>
the Schole with Sects and
Opinions, the Church with Schism
and Superstition. As <hi>Aristip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus</hi>
compared the Sophisters of
his time to the meaner sort of
<hi>Penelope's</hi> Suitors, who were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
by her Maids, but never
had the sight of her self: So they
studied only such Arts and Sciences
as are the Hand-maids of Wisdom
to dress and adorn her, but were
not acquainted with this Mistress of
Life. It is reported of a great and
wise Nobleman of this Nation, who
being entertained by the University,
and brought to view the publike
Scholes, the Logike-Schole, the
Rhetorike-Schole, the Physike-Schole,
the Divinity-Schole, and the
rest; after he had seen them all,
asked the Scholars whether they
had one Schole more, namely a
Schole of Discretion. Such wise
men as <hi>Solomon, Xenophon, Caesar,</hi>
and others, being also learned, have
by their Wisdom directed Learning
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:53793:47"/>
to the right end, and improved it
to the hight, gaining honor by it,
and being themselvs an honor to it.
Bare Learning, though of the best
kind, is but a Map of Happiness,
and no reall Felicity.</p>

            <div n="15" type="part">
               <head>XV.
Of Wisdom.</head>
               <p>WIsdom or Prudence is the
Art of Living. It is a
cheap Caterer, a neat Cook, a wise
Steward and Dispenser of all things.
The first and fundamental part of
Wisdom is a clear and solid Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
whereby a man, like a well-sented
Hound, rightly pursues all
the windings and turnings in the
whole course of Business, and as it
is said of <hi>Achitophel,</hi> speaks Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
foreseeing and foretelling the
success of things by the strength of
this sagacious faculty, which the
poreblinde Vulgar cannot discern:
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:53793:48"/>
and such commonly were the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels
Oracles: for he having a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ken of things then men, saw
them rising and coming on before
them, and so foretold them. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Fortune of all Humane af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
is so britle, that the least crack
may endanger the whole fabrike,
and therefore none but God can
certainly foreknow; there must be
another subsidiary Art to second the
former, which as a present and ready
Wit to obviate or advance sudden
Accidents: for as there is no Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
so secure but hath some flaws in
it, so there is scarcely any so despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
but hath some opportunity of
recovery, even to the last, as it is
said of eternal Salvation, <hi>Inter
pontem, &amp; fontem,</hi> if a man have
the grace to lay hold on it. <hi>Caesar</hi>
herein excelled all men: as <hi>Lucan</hi>
saith of him,
<q>
                     <l>— Semper feliciter usus.</l>
                     <l>Praecipiti cursu bellorum, &amp; tempore
rapto<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:53793:48"/>
He who is quick in Action, had
need be quick of Apprehension:
and he who is sure of the latter, may
more safely venture on the former;
both together work Miracles. Thus
<hi>Caesar</hi> effected his great Designs: he
seldom lost any opportunity, but
was sure to clap up a good bargain
for himself whensoever it was offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
which is the most thriving way
in the world. Craft is of a bastard
kind and supposititious to Wisdom.
Though Stratagems may be usefull
in VVar, where all depends upon
sudden action, and they on whom
they are practised are Enemies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand,
and so more lawfull: yet
even in that, <hi>Scipio</hi> gained more by
the reputation of his Justice and
Fidelity, then <hi>Hannibal</hi> by all his
Cunning: Certainly he was more
to be honored and better beloved.
But in all Civill and Domestike af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
fair and square dealing, joined
with good discretion, is generally
as effectual, and alwaies more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable.
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:53793:49"/>
The next part is Action
and Execution. It is an universall
Law imposed upon all men, <hi>That in
the sweat of our face, we must earn
our Bread.</hi> He who shuns Labor
runs upon Inconvenience, which is
far more troublesome, and so the
Burden returns upon him with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Pressure. Many men of large
Abilities relying wholly upon their
Wit, and neglecting the use of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
means, suffer others less
able, but more active and industri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
to go beyond them. The way
to dispatch much, is to be alwayes
doing, to keep beforehand with
Business, and rid it off our hands
as fast as it comes on, which makes
it go away merrily. Order and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
are good helps, but not to be
too precisely observ'd, especially such
as consist in Imaginary Lines and
Figures; as to defer to begin a
business till the beginning of a Day,
a Week, or a Year; whereas per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
the end of the time precedent
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:53793:49"/>
may be as good an Opportunity,
and so much the better, because it is
sooner. Lastly there are certain Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies
and Forms which must
neither be affected nor neglected.
To be of a sober and grave carriage,
to use a civill respect toward the
Person, but yet retain the thing,
yielding in Circumstances, that we
may better hold the Substance. We
must live according to Fashion and
Custom as far as lawfully we may.
To salute, to visite, to court, and
such like civill Complements are
very commendable. It is the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happiness
of some Learned and
Wise men, who because they see
through the vanity of these things,
do not only despise them, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
against the World for them,
so long, till the World exclaim on
them. Though Wisdom be the
most curious Artifice of the Mind,
effecting those things which Poets
imagine, and Historians relate, yet
it is also vain and uncertain. The
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:53793:50"/>
wisest man knows not always how
to levell his Ordnance aright, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the inconstant waving of the
whole sea of Business; and all great
enterprises and dealings in the
World are like Cranes, or such other
mighty Engines, which if they be
well managed, perform Wonders;
but if the foot once slip, or the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
fail, it may knock out his brains
who uses it. But the worst and
greatest opposition is from the
wickedness of men. <hi>The whole
World lies in sin,</hi> which a Good
man cannot forbear to oppose,
though it be most contrary to all
rules of Policy, and may prove the
certain ruine of himself. Many a
man against whom the World hath
nothing to say, but in the matter
of his God, hath been undone only
by his Piety. <hi>Machiavel</hi> hath
truly observed, that the way of
Christian Religion, if strictly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued,
is directly contrary to the
way of Policy. As our Saviour said
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:53793:50"/>
of himself, so may all his Servants
say likewise. <hi>Their Kingdom is not
of this world:</hi> The Jewes have a
Proverb much to the same purpose
concerning such great dealers in the
world. <hi>That a greater Huckster can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be innocent:</hi> which makes me
wonder at those ancient Worthies,
<hi>Ioseph, Moses, Daniel,</hi> and the rest,
how they could govern great Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires,
&amp; yet continue so strictly Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
&amp; Religious: but I consider that
they were assisted by an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
Spirit, and sometimes God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
was fain to help them out with
a Miracle. But to <hi>fear God and keep
his Commandments,</hi> is the only Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and will at last, when the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compts
of the whole World shall
be cast up, be found to be the best
Preferment, and highest Happiness.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>SOlomon</hi> saith, <hi>He who ruleth his

taketh a City:</hi> Yea it is no small
advantage in Civill affairs for a
man to have the command of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
upon all occasions, standing
upon the shore of a firm Mind, and
beholding others tossed on the Sea
of their own Passions, and so suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
them like great Whales to
beat themselvs till they become
tame and tractable. The greatest
Conquerors have been conquered
by their Lusts, which we may truly
stile, as <hi>Diogenes</hi> doth Kings Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubines,
<hi>Regum Reginas.</hi> The end
of true Philosophy is to rectifie the
Soul: The strange effect thereof in
<hi>Polemon</hi> may seem a kind of Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical
Conversion; who coming
into the Schole of <hi>Xenocrates</hi> with
his drunken company crowned with
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:53793:51"/>
Garlands, purposely to outface him
and his Philosophy; <hi>Xenocrates</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on with his Lecture of Temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
pressed it so far, and wrought
so much upon him, that he imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly
abandoned his former course
of Life, and became his Disciple,
succeeding him in the same Schole,
and proved the most strict of the
whole Sect. But though Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to God, from whom Man is
wholy alienated, cannot be wrought
without Divine Grace, yet as there
are Remainders of Bodily Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
so also some seeds and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of Moral Virtue, which may
be advantaged by a good Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Body, and greatly improved
by Education and Instruction: In
this the Philosophers went too far,
that they attributed to Man a full
liberty and power of governing
himself and all his affairs by the
absolute Soveraignty of his own
Spirit; and indeed the Poets seem
better Divines in their Expressions
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:53793:52"/>
to this purpose then the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,
beginning their Poems with
<hi>A Iove principium,</hi> or the invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a Deity: and ascribing the
acts of their greatest Hero's to some
Tutelar God. We may, yea we
ought to exercise and improve any
power we have in our selves, but we
must always depend upon God for
his blessing and assistance herein, as
well as for the obtaining his super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
Grace. The Spirit of a Man
is very Malleable, if it be carefully
and wisely handled. The first and
most immediate Issues of the Mind
are our Thoughts, being as it were
the Animal Spirits thereof, whereby
it acts all its Business, or like <hi>Leu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cippus</hi>
his Atomes, the Seeds of the
Spiritual World: which while they
float in a vast Inanity are lost, and
come to nothing, but being fixed
and embodied, prove most beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and excellent Forms. He who
intendeth what he doth, is most
like to do what he intendeth: Yet
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:53793:52"/>
we must not be so intent upon any
thing, as to loose the command of
our selvs. Delightfull Studies are
like strong Wines drunk in with
pleasure, but after fill the head with
a throng of unruly Spirits, which
distemper and intoxicate it. In such
cases it is good to entertain some
other Studies as pleasing, and so
pass from one to another, till the
Mind be lull'd asleep. Some by
the help of a Game at Chess, which
is a most studious and sollicitous
Sport, have escaped the Tyranny of
their serious Anxieties. As we must
thus manage our Minds, so we must
govern them by a right Judgment
and pure Reason, abstracted from
all Fancies and Opinions. Some are
wholly led by Traditions, and the
Authority of others, or by their
own Education and Custom, which
is a slavery of the Mind worse then
that of the Body. Some on the
other side do so much affect liberty
of Spirit, that they conceive a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:53793:53"/>
prejudice against all common
Truths, because they are backed by
such common advantages, though
they are not grounded upon them.
But a cleer and free Spirit seeketh
Truth it self, and entertaineth it
wheresoever he findeth it, which is
the right temper of a true Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher.
The truest Philosophy, and
that which distinguishes it from So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phistry,
is to deduce it from Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to Action: and instead of
Disputing to prove it by Exercise
and Example. There is commonly
a great distance, and in some a kind
of contrariety between Theory and
Practice: for that Good which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gages
the Will and the whole Man
to Practice, is not simple Right, but
rather Profit; not Duty but Benefit.
Thus though the Mind judge a
thing to be Just and Honest, and so
fit to be done in general, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
judgeth it Unprofitable, and so
not Convenient for him to do, his
Practical Judgment opposeth and
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:53793:53"/>
overcometh his Speculative. He seeth
better and followeth worse, that is,
worse in point of Right, but not
worse as he deemeth, in point of
Profit. <hi>Cicero</hi> like a true Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher,
in his excellent Book of Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
harps upon the right string, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Honesty to be the greatest U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility,
yea one and the same thing;
and so indeed they are in themselvs,
but the Mind of Man apprehends
them under several Notions: The
fallacy consists in this, that we look
only upon the particular present
Good, though far less, and do not
consider the more universall and
greater Good to which it ought to
be subordinate, and being opposed,
becomes Evill, for so it is the
loss of a greater Good then it self.
A Temperate man looking upon the
Wine as it is red in the Glass, is by
his Appetite incited to drink there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
as well as a Drunkard, and knows
there is a natural Good and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santness
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:53793:54"/>
in it: but when he wisely
considers the whole state of his
Body and Mind, and thereupon
finds it will do him more Hurt then
Good, he most willingly abstains
from it as Evil. So a man who hath
a Member gangraenated, as he looks
upon it particularly, is loth to loose
it with so much pain, but consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that it is better for him to part
with it, then that the whole Body
should perish, he as willingly abdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates
it, as he would pull out an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
sticking in his side. Thus if in
all our actions we would seriously
reflect upon the whole Nature of
Man, and of the universe, and upon
God the Creator of all, we should
clearly understand that this great
King and Governor of all hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
such Common Laws for
the safety of the whole Empire,
and the true Good of every Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
that though Justice may seem
contrary to some particular and
lesser Good, yet it is most conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:53793:54"/>
to our Chief Good and true
Happiness, to which the others
must be reduced. And thus we
may gain the Practical Judgment
of a right Philosopher: but yet
in the Executive part we shall meet
with many difficulties through hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
frailty and naturall impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
which must be overcome by
constant Exercise. Acts of Virtue
confirm Habits, and Habits facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
Acts. <hi>Virtus docetur arte, vita
discitur.</hi> There are so many Errors
and Lusts within the Soul, and such
Temptations without, that this

yet without true Piety he were

Of the Sceptikes and Cynikes.</head>
               <p>THere is scarcely any Humor of
Men or Manner of Living, that
hath any shadow of Happiness,
which the Philosophers have not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
and drest up in its best Attire,
and so presented it to the World
for the Chief Good: only Money,
that common Idoll of other men,
was never professedly set up by any
Philosopher: as <hi>Luther</hi> said of
himself, that he had been tempred
to all sins except Covetousness.
The strangest kind of Philosophy,
or rather the contradiction of all
Philosophy, is Scepticism, which
sprang up after all the rest, out of
their Differences and Disputes. In
all Ages when Scepticism abounds
it is a most certain Symptome of
the declination of true Philosophy,
and a prognostike of a general de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay
thereof ensuing, which we may
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:53793:55"/>
justly suspect in these times, wherein
plain and solid Truth is every
where arrained, and men affecting
the name of a Great Wit and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of Spirit, leave the beaten
path of true Learning and Wisdom
and wander at large in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of their own Imaginations:
which at first much please and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
them, but afterward prove
vain and unsatisfactory: and then
they grow malecontent, and quarrel
with all Learning, Knowledge, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and Religion, like distracted
men, who by too strong an intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of their Imagination have hurt
their <hi>Cranium;</hi> so these by too much
nicety and subtilty of Wit strain
their <hi>Criterion.</hi> But the most dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
is Practical Scepticism, which
depends upon the other; and yet
the other many times proceedeth
from it. Men of loose and vitious
lives, indulgent to their own <hi>Genius,</hi>
cannot endure to be controlled nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by others, nor by their own
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:53793:56"/>
Judgments: and therefore affect a
Licenciousness in Thinking as well
as in Acting. Others who are Dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall
enough in Opinion prove
Scepticall in Practice, having a
Form of Knowledge, but denying
the Power thereof: yea many who
have proceeded very far in the
Practice thereof, being at last con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed
by adverse Fortune, renounce
Truth, and Virtue, and Religion,
and yield up all to her: as <hi>Brutus</hi>
said when he came to dy,
<q>O Virtus, colui te ut rem, at tu no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
inane es!</q>
                  <hi>Socrates</hi> indeed professed, that he
knew only this, that he knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing:
which was a modest com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
arising from a thirsting desire
of knowing more, not an abando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of that he had already: for he
was a constant Teacher and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structer
of others, and most clear
and positive in all his Instructions,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:53793:56"/>
which is farthest from Scepticism:
yea he was so contrary to it, that he
affirmed it to be Madness and Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedness
to enquire of the Gods
themselvs concerning those things
which men by their own reason and
understanding might comprehend,
as it is not to enquire of them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
future Contingencies, which
no Humane Reason can certainly
foreknow. That Speech of <hi>Socrates</hi>
was rather in opposition to the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phisters,
who know least, and yet
were most peremptory in their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
and imposed them on others.
Confidence without Reason, or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
Truth upon trust is a great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment
to sound Knowledge: but
to despair of knowing any thing,
and so to sit down in perpetuall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strust,
is an absolute bar to all
Knowledge. Sceptikes place the
Happiness of the Mind in a Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity
or Indifferency to all Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.
There is undoubtedly one
Truth, but they say there is no Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:53793:57"/>
which hath not a contrary Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
so that Man cannot certainly
know it. To what end then is
Reason bestowed upon Man, if he
can only hunt after Truth, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
find it out? He who despaireth
to finde it, looseth it, as well as he
who mistakes it. A man in a Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
meeting with many severall
waies, and not knowing which to
take, must enquire, and judge, and
satisfy himself as well as he may, and
so proceed: for should he stand
still and spend the whole day in
doubting and musing, he should
certainly run into the same incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience
which he seeks to avoid:
whereas by pursuing the most like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
way, he may more probably ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish
his intended Journey. If
the danger of Erring, to which all
Humane Nature is subject, were a
sufficient excuse, not only Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
but also all Action should
cease. Judges should not judge,
Teachers should not teach, Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:53793:57"/>
of Physike or any other Art
should not practice. Men should
doubt of acting or not acting any
thing, living, or not living, &amp; so to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
the Waves of uncertainty, sink
into the Sea of confusion. Sceptikes
are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly in the Schole captious,
in Life Satyrists, in the State Neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trall,
in Religion Scoffers and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spisers,
which are all as destructive
Errors to Humane society, as can
arise from any Dogmatical opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
They generally incline to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
and are vehement in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
and yet know not but that
their contrary Reason may be as
weak as the other; And thus to
presume that their own Negative
Arguments are right and true is as
much Dogmatical as any positive
Affirmation, which shows the false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and perversity of this Humor,
which if it were true to it self the
professors thereof should suspend
all Reason whereby they act as
Men, and only sit still and look
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:53793:58"/>
about them like Beasts. As the Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes
were opposite to all Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,
so were the Cynikes to all
Humanity: for considering the
certain Miseries and uncertain Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
of the Life of Man, they jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
it best to contract themselvs
and all their affairs into as narrow
a compass as they could, discharging
themselvs of whatsoever was more
then necessary. <hi>Diogenes</hi> seeing a
Boy drink out of his Hand, threw
away his Dish: and <hi>Crates</hi> wished
that the Stones of the River were
Bread, as the Water is Drink, that
so he might be furnished with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Provision by Nature. Hence
they despised both the Flattery and
Fury of Fortune, harding their
Minds and Bodies against her, by
lying in the Snow in Winter, and
in the hot Sands in Summer, beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
of Statues, and provoking
common Whores to scold with
them. Though Scepticism may seem
Modesty, &amp; Cynicism Humility, and
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:53793:58"/>
Poverty of spirit as well as of all
outward things, yet these Humors
puff up the Mind with a conceit of
Liberty &amp; Greatness as much as any.
<hi>Diogenes</hi> when he stood in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket
to be sold for a slave, and others
cried out, Who will buy a good
Slave? cried out as fast, Who will
buy a good Master? and his beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vior
toward <hi>Alexander</hi> was such,
that it made him wish himself <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes</hi>
if he were not <hi>Alexander.</hi> No
mean condition could suffice him,
nor could he like <hi>Parmenio,</hi> divide
Empires, but resolved to conquer
the World either by subduing, or
by despising it. But this cannot be
the true Happiness of Man, for
though preparation and obstinacy
are great advantages in suffering,
whereby the very Boies of <hi>Sparta</hi>
turned torments into sport and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise,
yet he is truly wise, who can
both endure Evill, and enjoy Good,
which is a temper most sutable to
the whole State of Man: and the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:53793:59"/>
one without the other but an half
part of Wisdom joyned with as
much Folly, for it orders but one
half of the Life of Man, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroies
the other. This strange and
uncouth Sect had another Humor,
far wors then the former, to despise
&amp; deride all others: which plainly
discovers the vanity and petulancy
thereof. Some have so great a Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of wit, that they make wit their
greatest Felicity, jesting themselvs
out of all that is earnest, and will not
suffer any solid Truth to fix upon
them; but like fools, make a sport
of every thing. Others think to jeer
men out of their follies, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
them by abusing them: Such
Satyricall scoffs and quips are like
Squibs and Crackers, which do
harm in Festivalls, and no good in
Fights: imbittering and provoking
ingen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ous spirits, and marring the
best Reproofs, turning Physike into
Poison. To make a sport of other
mens Infirmities, is as impious and
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:53793:59"/>
inhumane, as to laugh at their mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.
<hi>Heraclitus</hi> was far more chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
herein then <hi>Democritus:</hi> yet
such is the naturall pravity and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignancy
of Men, that they delight
almost as much in speaking<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
hearing ill of others, as in their own
praises; whereas the nature of the
Tong is not to wound, but to supple
and heal. But the worst of this sort,
and indeed rather a Divell then a
Man, was <hi>Timon the Athenian,</hi> who
hated all Mankind. It may be said
of such <hi>Misanthropi,</hi> as it was of
that conceited <hi>Misogynus,</hi> whose
Mistress was <hi>Nullae,</hi> that it was like
to prove a happy Match; for he
loved <hi>Nulla,</hi> and <hi>Nullae</hi> loved him.
They who hate all, deserv to be ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of all; which is a condition so
far from Happiness, that no Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
thing can be more contrary
unto it.</p>

Of the Cyreniakes and Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reans.</head>
               <p>THE Cyreniakes were most
contrary to the Cynikes, as
may appear by the discourse which
passed between the two grand Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of the Sects. <hi>Aristippus</hi> told
<hi>Diogenes,</hi> That if he knew how to
live at Court, he should not need to
eat Herbs, and <hi>Diogenes</hi> answered
him again, That if he knew how to
eat Herbs, he should not need to
live at Court. These Cyreniakes
did not profess any state of univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall
Happiness, but pieced and patch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it up with particular acts of
Pleasure, chiefly Corporeall. Their
main Argument which they use to
defend this sensuall Philosophy, is a
sufficient Confutation thereof. They
say that Man, while he is yet a Child,
and not deluded with false opinions,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:53793:60"/>
doth naturally delight in Bodily
Pleasure, and is offended with the
least Pain, which only proveth it a
Childish Felicity, and not far from
Brutish, an Infant little differing
from a Beast, being strong in Sense,
and weak in Reason: but to make
any Corporeall thing the Chief
Good of a Rationall Soul, is most
Irrationall. This sensuall Lust or
Love of Pleasure is alwaies accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
with a gross self-love, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
proceedeth from it: which the
Cyreniakes did openly profess and
avow, making the whole world
their Circumference, and themselvs
the Center. <hi>Aristippus</hi> went so far,
as to cast off Naturall Affection to
his Children, who are the next to a
mans Self, yea as Limbs and Parts
of the Parent: when he abdicated
his Son, he approved it to be as just
and naturall, as to cut off his Hair,
or pair his Nails when they grow
offensive. <hi>Theodorus</hi> was so infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
for these gross opinions, that
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:53793:61"/>
he was commonly called, The Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ist,
and again Ironically, a God:
for indeed he who denieth God, is
his own God, making himself his
utmost end, which is to Deify him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
<hi>Aristippus</hi> is the Patron of vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuous
Courtiers, and merry
Companions; though he had few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
successors in the Schole, he hath
most followers in the World. This
Geniall kind of Happiness consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in easy and delightfull Studies,
pleasant Discourses, amorous Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies,
Feastings, Maskings, Revellings,
and all kind of Courtship and Jovi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality,
All which ravish weaker
Minds, who when they enter into
Princes Courts, think them the only
Heaven upon Earth, and their pomp
and pleasure the very Life of the
Gods, as the Cynike fitly stiled
them, <hi>Miracula Stultorum.</hi> Mens
spirits are no where better disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
then in a Court. Vain men
having once tasted of the delights
thereof, can hardly ever after en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:53793:61"/>
to live privately , whereas a
sober man will love a private life
better then ever he did before. That
which is most to be lamented, is the
loss of many a Brave and Gallant
man through this Humor of Genia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.
How sad a thing is it to see the
companions of an <hi>Vlysses</hi> charmed
by this <hi>Circe,</hi> and transformed into
Beasts, men like <hi>Aristippus,</hi> of
great Wit and Learning, or as <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronius,
Pares negotiis,</hi> fit for Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and of excellent Abilities, to
make no other use of them, then to
trifle away their time more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santly,
and ruine themselvs more
wittily, as strong Must resolving
wholly into Spume and Vapor? All
Ages are full of such Examples, but
never did any man fool away a
great Spirit, and a greater Fortune,
like <hi>Mark Anthony;</hi> who was so
far bewitched with his <hi>Cleopatra,</hi>
that in the heat of the Battell of
<hi>Actium,</hi> when the Empire of the
World, his life, and all lay at stake,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:53793:62"/>
he fled from <hi>Augustus</hi> to pursue
her; whereas if he had fled from
her, he might very probably have
pursued <hi>Augustus.</hi> The Epicure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
far excell the Cyreniakes: for
though they make Pleasure their
Chief Good, yet they refine it from
the dross and dregs, and exalt it
from the particular acts and moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
thereof, to a constant state of
universall Delight: gratifying the
Mind with all pleasing things, and
defending it from grief and pertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation,
in the midst of externall
pains: which opinion, if rightly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood,
holds forth as high an
Happiness as this World can afford,
marshalling the severall sorts of
Pleasures according to their severall
natures and degrees, and making
the Pleasure of Virtue to be Chief:
for the enjoying whereof we should
cheerfully endure any inferior pains
or miseries. Yet they placed not
this Happiness in the goodness of
Virtue, but in the Pleasure thereof,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:53793:62"/>
But the Chief Good, and the Chief
Happines differ only in the Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and not in the Thing: For this
Pleasure of Virtue cannot be had or
enjoied without the Love of Virtue,
from which it doth arise: To do a
virtuous action without Love and
Delight, is no Virtue; and to do
it with the greatest Delight, is the
greatest Virtue: and thus <hi>Epicurus</hi>
well expresseth himself; That Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
may be separated from all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things, but not from Virtue:
for all other things must be subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate
to Virtue, orherwise there is
no true Pleasure in them. But as <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi>
observeth, the Epicurean Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
was very sublime and Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phicall,
had their Practice been an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable
unto it. <hi>Horace</hi> plainly
confesseth himself<hi>—Epicuri de grege
porcum.</hi> Those outward Pleasures,
though admitted only as subservi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to Virtue, so prevailed against
it, that leaving the Mistress, they fell
in love with the Maid, and instead
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:53793:63"/>
of making Virtue the Chief Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
made Pleasure the Chief Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.
Thus was this most excellent
Opinion, which drest up Virtue in
her fairest habit, and presented her
most lovely aspect to the Minds of
men vitiated by a corrupt Practice.
<hi>Epicurus</hi> is the Institutor of a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
and Sedentary Life, prescribing
to dwell in a Garden of Pleasure,
enjoying the purest delights of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and entertaining our selvs
with most beautifull Contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
or good Society, free from all
cares and troubles. <hi>Pomponius At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticus</hi>
was a most exact man in this
kind of Life, and far more happy
then all the great Conquerors of his
time, who troubled the World and
themselvs with their vast Designs,
and great Enterprises. This <hi>Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>
thought to be the Happiness of
God; and did not only separate
him from the care of Men, but also
Men from the care of God: esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all Religion as Superstition, or
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:53793:63"/>
the impertinent curiosity of a fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Mind. Yea, he seems to sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
us from the mutuall care of one
another, by withdrawing us from
all publike affairs, which must main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
every private State: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we ought to share in the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
as well as in the Benefit; and
when it becomes our Duty, is also
part of our Happiness.</p>

               <p>Comparing the Soul and Body of
Man to Heaven and Earth. The
Mind, which he calls a Heavenly
seed, is pure and Ethereall, enjoying
perpetuall peace in all its motions,
like the Heavenly Orbs. But the
Body, like the Earth, of which it is
made, is dull and heavy, and the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
as the Aire or middle Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
between both, by Vapors as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending
from the Earthly members,
fill the Soul with Clouds and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pests,
which darken and imprison
the Heavenly Light. Now the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:53793:64"/>
Stoikes would have us live above
these Clouds, like Angels and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits:
but we can no more live in
this World without Affections, then
without Bodies: nor may we affect
a Separate state in this Life. The Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall
and Sensitive parts of Man
are not two distinct Persons, as an
Horse and his Rider; but rather
like the Poeticall ficton of the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taur,
who was both Horse and Rider
in one, so that the one being wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
the other feels it, and sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thizes
with it. Thus the Mind rules
the Fansy and Affections, and they
excite or damp the Corporeall spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
and cause fluxes and refluxes of
them: and so likewise the Body by
the Humors thereof irritates the
Fansy and Affections, and they
tempt and sollicite the Mind: but
as the Inferior part cannot compell
the Superior, so the Superior may
not abdicate or sequester the Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior.
Wherefore it may be justly
admired how the Stoikes, who made
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:53793:65"/>
it their Chief End to live according
to the Nature of the Universe,
should not allow Man to live ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Universality of his
own Nature, in the full latitude and
extent thereof. It is an high expro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration
of God and Nature, to
think that these Affections were
placed in us, only to be opposed and
trampled on, as evill: whereas in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
they are of greatest use, being
the Wings of the Soul, and quickest
Inciters of Action. What a dull
thing were Generation and Nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
if there were no Concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scence?
What comfort in educating
Children without Naturall Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
What spur to mutuall Opitula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
if there were no pity? So
that to deprive Man of his Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which mediate between the
Soul<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Body, is to murder
himself; to forbid natural Affection,
is to ruine whole Families: to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Pity, is to wrong all Mankind:
which last is the most bloudy and
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:53793:65"/>
barbarous Sentence in all the Stoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
Philosophy: for though they
allow some other Faculties in the
Rationall part, analagous to those
Sensitive Affections which appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
Good (and undoubtedly the
Angels have some such Powers of
exercising their Love and Hate, Joy
and Grief, and the like) yet they
wholly exclude Pity, as well as Fear
and Grief, from a wise man, because
these pierce and wound the Soul;
though being rightly exercised, they
may be as instrumentall to Reason,
and produce as happy effects as the
other. But these and such like are
Philosophicall Conceits and Brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
like the Poeticall labors of
<hi>Hercules,</hi> as much exceeding the
condition of the Soul, as the other
the strength of the Body: and their
own Practice commonly confuted
their Opinion. <hi>Dionysius,</hi> one of
that Sect, being vexed with a very
sore pain in his eies, was forced to
confess that Pain is no indifferent
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:53793:66"/>
thing. <hi>Antigonus</hi> caused a servant to
step in suddenly, and tell <hi>Perseus,</hi>
the Scholar of <hi>Zeno,</hi> that the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
had plundered his house,
whereupon perceiving him very
much troubled, he convinced him
that Riches were no such indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
thing as he professed. To take
away Affections is unnaturall, but
not to manage them rightly, is irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall,
and so against the Nature of
Man, whose Reason is his Guide
and Governor, instead of all those
Naturall Instincts in Brute Beasts,
which move and limit their Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
and therefore when Man neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects
to rule them by Reason, they
hurry him away violently beyond
the fury and lust of Beasts. Wee
should never be wholly acted and
possessed by them, as a Sea is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally
troubled with a Tempest:
but keep them alway in our own
hand and power, as <hi>Vlysses</hi> did the
Winds in a Bottle, letting them
out more or less, as he pleased.
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:53793:66"/>
There are three severall waies of
governing them. First, by the Light
of Understanding and right Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
to dissolv and dissipate the
Cloud of Passion. Secondly, by
keeping under the Body (the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors
and Vapors whereof do feed
and nourish our Affections) to tame
them. Thirdly by committing them
among themselvs, and tempeting
one with another, to break them.
The Peripatetikes, who were more
accurate and judicious in the study
of Nature then the Stoikes, or any
other Sect of Philosophers, allow
Man all things whatsoever which do
belong to his Nature, to make up
his perfect Happiness; not only the
exercise of his Affections, but all
other good things where of he is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
from the highest to the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est.
Both Stoiker and Peripate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes
agree the Chief Happiness of
Man to be Virtue, but the Stoikes
place it in the Habit of Virtue, and
the Peripatetikes in the Act<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:53793:67"/>
yet the Stoikes were generally
greater Practicers and Actors of
Virtue then the Peripatetikes. But
these two Opinions may be thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled.
The Stoikes intend such
an Habit of Virtue which produceth
the Acts thereof, and the Peripate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes
such Acts of Virtue as flow
from the Habit thereof: and so the
Habituall Felicity of the Soul con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth
in the Habit of Virtue, and
the Actuall Felicity in virtuous A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.
The Foundation is the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit,
but the Act or Exercise is the
Perfection. A virtuous Intention or
Endeavor is some kind of Exercise
of the Habit, and instead of the Act,
but not so noble and illustrious, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it wanteth an outward exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence.
<hi>Aristotles</hi> Happy man is an
Hero or <hi>Hercules,</hi> made up of all
Humane Excellencies. His Zodiake
of Virtues reacheth from Head to
Feet, from Magnanimity to Urba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.
Both which, though some se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer
Christians have arrained as vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:53793:67"/>
and exceeding the just pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
of Virtue in both extremes,
yet certainly in a sober sense may
well be allowed. True Magnanimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is not opposed to Humility, but
to Baseness and Meanness of Spirit,
yea it consenteth with Humility a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Pride. <hi>Africanus,</hi> the most
perfect example of all <hi>Aristotles</hi>
Virtues, is famous for both. His
Magnanimity was so great, that
his very stately deportment and
outward presence, as <hi>Livy</hi> report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
of him, drew many out of the
Country round about to behold
him, and his Greatness of Spirit was
sufficiently testified by his Great
Actions: and yet his Humility was
as great, both in his private conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation,
and also in his most willing
submission to the Commonwealth;
so that he waived all those fair ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
he had of making himself
as absolute as <hi>Caesar:</hi> and by a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
recess, yielded to the inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
and ingratitude of the People,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:53793:68"/>
rather then he would make any
commotion in the State. Nor is
Urbanity an enemy ot Gravity, but
to Rusticity, and opposeth Levity
as much as it. <hi>Socrates, Cato Major,</hi>
and other sober men have been ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
pleasant and facetious. <hi>Xenophon</hi>
was very virtuous, and no less ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant.
I do not affect to defame
Philosophy, nor by depressing it, to
exalt Christianity: but rather suck
out of every Flower whatsoever
may make an Ingredient of this U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversall
Happiness of Man. The
chief thing wanting in all those Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers
is true Piety, which is the
same proportionably toward God,
as Virtue is toward Man, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if there be any Happiness in
Virtue, it cannot be perfect, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
true, without Piety.</p>

Of the Platonikes, and of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates.</head>
               <p>ARistotle is called the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher,
and <hi>Plato</hi> the Divine.
<hi>Aristotle</hi> was a man of the sharpest
Reason among all the Philosophers;
but he relied so much on Reason,
that he both neglected Sense, and
sensible Experiments, and denied
Faith and Divine Mysteries. His
Rationall discourses and Metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicall
notions are most probable,
and exactly Philosophicall: but
his Empiricall observations very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain,
and unworthy so great a
Philosopher: and his opinions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
matters of Faith, as the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
of the World, and dissolution
thereof, most false and absurd. As
Physicians and Chymicall Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
have exceeded him in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
so the Platonikes and Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gists
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:53793:69"/>
in the latter. <hi>Plato</hi> having tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
into <hi>Egypt,</hi> was there by the
Priests instructed in their Mysticall
Divinity, which the <hi>Egyptians</hi> most
probably received from <hi>Ioseph,</hi> and
the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> corrupting it with
their own Idolatry and Traditions.
But he as a Philosopher endeavored
to refine it with the <hi>Graecian</hi> Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy,
which he had learned from his
Master <hi>Socrates,</hi> and his own Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations.
We may find in him some
fragments, and little Aires of the
most profound Mysteries in Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
but so broken and imperfect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
that they are rather matter of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration
to us Christians to read
them in a Heathen, then any cleer
information or evidence of the
Truth. He attributes much to the
authority of the Ancients, as better
and wiser then Posterity, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds
no Word of Divine Truth
on which to ground a Belief. Yet
he happily hit upon the true End
and Chief Happiness of Man, which
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:53793:69"/>
is to be made like unto God by a
conjunction of the Mind with him,
erecting Piety above Virtues and
so leads us into another World, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting
us familiarly with God,
and Angels, and spirituall <hi>Idea's,</hi> by
abstracting the Soul from those in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior
and Corporeall things, and
advancing it to the Contemplation
of the first Cause, and Creator of all
things: which is a most beautifull
and glorious Vision, and a great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
to true Piety and Religion.
Yet notwithstanding these high spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations,
he seems to fall short in
the Practice of Divinity. I do not
speak of his own exemplary Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
but of his Practicall docu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and rules concerning true
Piety and the power of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
As <hi>Aristotle</hi> in his Naturall
Philosophy, so he in his Divinity are
generally more Notional then Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticall.
Of the Philosophers who
either preceded or succeeded, <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi>
was certainly the ablest and
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:53793:70"/>
wisest, and himself the most perfect
Example of his own Doctrine,
<hi>Heraclitus, Pythagoras,</hi> and others
before him are dark and obscure,
full of Imaginary Fansies and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balisticall
conceits. The seaven
Wise men may be all summed up in
one <hi>Socrates. Plato, Aristotle,</hi> and
all who followed him are more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
and Sophisticall: nor could
any of his own Scholars exactly
follow him, but presently degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
into vain Opinions, and a
more licentious Life: nor do we
read of any distinct Sect of Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes,
but rather all succeeding Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy,
and the severall sorts
thereof, were Branches growing up
out of this Root. <hi>Plato</hi> followed
him in Divinity, seeking to improve
it with Mysticall traditions, <hi>Xeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon</hi>
was most like him in Civil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation,
but more Glorious and
Active. The Peripatetikes follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his Study of Nature: but are
more subtile and Sophisticall. The
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:53793:70"/>
Stoikes chose his study of Virtue
and professing to live according to
the Universal Nature: but stretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it to a strange severity and most
unnaturall Inhumanity. The Cyre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niakes
and Epicureans pretended to
his pure delights and freer use of
Pleasures: but defiled them with
gross voluptuousness. The Cynikes
emulated his contempt of all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary
things, and that excellent
sentence, <hi>That he who needeth least,
is most like God,</hi> but became Brutish
and Nasty. The Sceptikes his op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
the presumptuous confidence
of the Sophisters, pursuing it so far
that they overthrew all his founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Truth and Knowledge. He
had a very clear and right Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
of all the Affairs of Life
from the meanest and most Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall,
to the highest and most In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectuall,
and made it his Business
to edifie others, that every man
with whom he conversed might be
bettered by his company: which is
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:53793:71"/>
a most Noble and Divine emploi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Observ his discourses in the
Streets with Strangers and Passen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
in the Shops with Artificers, in
his House with his Family, in his
Meetings and <hi>Symposiums</hi> with
merry Company, in his Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
with his Scholars, and in
publike Assemblies with the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens;
and you shall finde in
them all most apposite and solid In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions
concerning all occasions
of Life, Private, Domesticall, Civill,
Military, Naturall, and Divine, in a
free and familiar way of arguing by
mutuall Conference, and a rationall
Induction through undeniable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions,
without any cunning So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phistry
or flourishing Rhetorike,
and yet more perswasive and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall
then either. He was absolutely
the best Master of Life among all
Heathen. <hi>Horace</hi> a good Critike,
though herein he prefer <hi>Homer,</hi>
and the Poets before <hi>Chrysippus,</hi>
and <hi>Crantor,</hi> and such other curious
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:53793:71"/>
disputers; yet instructs his Poet to
borrow Matter from Socraticall
Philosophy.
<q>Rem tibi Socraticae possnnt ostendere
chartae.</q>
But the most strange and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
thing in him was his familiar
conversing with a God, or <hi>Daemon,</hi>
who, as he professeth, ever certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
advised in all doubtfull affairs. It
hath been a known Policy in many
Great men to make their Laws and
Counsells seem Oraculous, by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
that a Deity dictated unto
them: So did <hi>Numa, Sertorius,
Mahomet,</hi> and others: but none of
them so credibly true as this. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
God might inspire him with
an extraordinary Spirit of Naturall
Wisdom, &amp; perhaps with a Spirit of
Divination in this way of Counsell
and Advice concerning future and
contingent things: as he did revele
higher and more divine things to
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:53793:72"/>
                  <hi>Balaam,</hi> and the <hi>Sybills:</hi> yet I dare
not with <hi>Erasmus</hi> almost Canonize
him for a Saint, nor with Socinians
be confident of his Salvation. <hi>Xeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon</hi>
in his Apology for him tells us
how he worshipped the same Gods
which the City worshipped, and
taught him to sacrifice to their false
Gods. As the Oracle of <hi>Apollo</hi> did
him the honor to pronounce him
the Wisest of men, so he requited it
by acknowledging him a God, and
accepting his Testimoniall. Though
probably, as we may guess by <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to's</hi>
discourses, he esteemed those
inferior Gods as <hi>Daemons</hi> and Spirits
of a more Divine nature then Men,
yet this doth not excuse him of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,
nor can such worshiping of
Angels or Spirits be allowed in any
true Divinity. And though he were
most free from Vulgar or Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phicall
pride, yet there are strong
arguments of suspition, that he
was guilty of that spirituall pride
which most opposeth Salvation. In
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:53793:72"/>
his Life, and at his Death he judged
himself the best of Men, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth
litle or no confession of Sin,
or any thing like Christian Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
Without which there can be no
true conversion to God nor Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with him, and without
Divine Communion the Soul can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
attain her true and perfect
Happiness.</p>

that Duty and Worship
which we ow unto him, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warding
us with that Happiness
which we may enjoy in him, both
which consist together in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
of the Mind and Will of
Man with the Mind and Will of
God. As the highest Knowledge of
God which the Heathen attained,
was dark and doubtfull, so was their
service weak and saint. The <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>
inscribed their Altar, <hi>To the
unknown God,</hi> and their Worship
was as vain and ignorant. <hi>Whom
therefore,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>ye igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly
worship, him declare I unto
you:</hi> Where he plainly sheweth the
difference between Heathenish
Worship of God and true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
They had some glimmering ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:53793:74"/>
of God, <hi>If haply they
might feel after him, and find him,
though he be not far from every one
of us:</hi> but they abused it with their
Idolatry, and corrupted it with
their Lives, being so taught by their
Priests and Poets, who made Gods
of Men, and Men of Gods, attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting
Divine Virtues to their <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro's,</hi>
and Humane Vices to their
Deities. Yea the Philosophers, who
justly condemn them for this dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Impiety, yet fall short of the
Glory of God, gazing on him at a
great distance, and retaining this
Knowledge as a Secret or Mystery
in Nature, being indeed afraid of
the People, who were prepossessed
with their own Idolatry, which was
the Religion of the Stat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, and
therefore might not be contradict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
or disputed. And it is observable
of all such Nationall Religions,
that they may be more safely abused
then denied. The Poets were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
to corrupt their Divinity
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:53793:75"/>
with their Fables, rather then the
Philosophers to reduce it to Truth.
<hi>Socrates</hi> himself so far complied
with this Policy of State, that he
prescribed to worship God accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the manner of the Country,
subjecting the rule of Gods worship
to the Laws and Customes of Men:
which shows the weakness of the
highest Philosophy in the practicall
part of Religion, which is the life
and strength thereof; Whereas the
Apostle directly encounters the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenian</hi>
Idolatry, and plainly
preaches unto the People the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the true Deity, of Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
Providence, Sin, Redemption,
Repentance, Resurrection, and the
last Judgement. All false Religions
are most Cabalisticall and reserved,
thereby seeking to gain the reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Sacred, and are satisfied with
a vain Admiration, and blind Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
but true Religion freely and
clearly reveals it self to the world,
not concealing the most difficult
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:53793:75"/>
points, and Mysterious parts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of:
though sublime Truths be most
offensive to weak Minds. <hi>Immanis
verit as proxima est mendacio,</hi> that
is, in their apprehensions who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
well undestand it, yet being
sure of it self, and like a great Light,
impossible to be hid, it shines forth
in its own beams, and fears not to
appear as it is, however men may
entertain it. The Jews and Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
had commonly a more familiar
knowledge of the highest points in
Divinity, then the greatest Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,
and though all do not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
the power &amp; efficacy thereof,
yet some Holy men have exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
transcended the best of Heathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
Devotion. But nothing more
discovers their weak Knowledge of
true Piety, then their ignorance of
the true nature of Sin, which is the
contrary, or privation thereof.
They speak of it generally under the
notion of Vice, as it is a depravati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Nature, and common Enemy
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:53793:76"/>
to Mankind, but rise not to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
aggravation thereof, which is
the transgression of the Roiall Law
of an Infinite God, and a direct op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of the Creature to the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator,
wherein the very Sinfulness
thereof doth consist: as <hi>David</hi>
clearly saw and confessed, <hi>Against
thee, thee only have I sinned.</hi> So
likewise all their Doctrine of Moral
Virtue, whereof they so much boast,
tendeth to their own Praise and
Merit, the Good of others, and the
perfection of the Universe, rather
then the Glory of God, which is the
only Religious and Supreme End,
infusing Holiness into all inferior
actions, by subordinating them to
it self. True Religion consists in a
true Belief, and true Love of God.
There is in all men some kind of
Belief of God, but being conscious
to themselvs, they fly from him as
their greatest Contrary; as it is
said of the Divels, <hi>They believ and
tremble.</hi> This terror and trembling
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:53793:76"/>
puts Atheists upon a strife, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor
within themselvs to cast off
their Belief, which yet they can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
do, but that at some time or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it will recoil upon them with
greater trouble and horror of Mind.
It makes the Superstitious to fear
and worship God as a severe Master
in a base and servile manner, with
the drudgery of Duties, especially
such as are most rigorous and cruell.
It makes Hypocrites to bribe their
Own Consciences, and flatter God
with a show of Holiness, which is
rather a worshipping of Men then
God. Thus Poets frame a Religion
according to their own Fansy; and
Philosophers according to their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect
Reason; and Statesmen
shape it according to Policy and
Reason of State; and the Religious
dress it up in severall forms and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shions
according to Tradition, and
their own Humors; and naturally
every man propounds to himself
such a Religion as will serve his own
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:53793:77"/>
turn, and whereby he may be sure to
be saved: yea some are so unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to exclude all others which
are not exactly of their size. But the

Of Faith.</head>
               <p>REason is most properly exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised
in things of Nature, and
Faith in matters of Religion; it
being the Echo of Divine Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
yet not meerly as an Echo,
which reporteth the sound without
any sense of Hearing; nor the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:53793:77"/>
of a Parasiticall assentation, <hi>Ais
aio, negas nego,</hi> which is a Flattery
furthest from Belief; nor the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
Implicite Faith depending upon
the Authority of men; but an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectuall
assent, and a Voluntary
consent to that which is reveled by
God. Our Great Wits set up Reason
instead of Faith, and the light of
Nature against Divine Light, which
is at once to deprive man of his
highest Faculty, and God of his
greatest Grace. As if because a Dog
usually hunts by Sent, we should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
that he can see by Sight. Faith
in generall is as naturall to a Man
as Reason, and he may aswell know
by Believing as by Discoursing: yea,
it is a more clear and certain know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the very Objects of Reason
then Reason it self, by relying on a
Divine Authority. <hi>Through saith,</hi>
faith the Apostle, <hi>we understand that
the Worlds were framed by the word of
God, so that the things which are seen,
were not made of things which do ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear:</hi>
                  <pb n="144" facs="tcp:53793:78"/>
which yet may be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
by the strength of naturall
Reason, for he saith elsewhere. <hi>That
the invisible things of God from the
Creation of the World are clearly seen,
being understood by the things that
are made, even his eternall power and
Godhead:</hi> but the same VVord
which created the VVorld, creates a
Belief in a spirituall Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
Belief is in this life in stead of
Intuition, &amp; shall at last be resolved
into it. Naturalists admire <hi>Socrates,</hi>
and cry him up for an high Instance
of the sufficiency of naturall Light
to instruct a man in the way of true
Virtue and Piety, and they willingly
admit of those Inspirations of a
God or <hi>Daemon</hi> whereof he speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
and yet will not allow the like
to Christians in the ordinary way
of a spiritual Belief. Faith and
Reason, like <hi>Antipodes,</hi> seem con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
but both meet in their Center,
Truth. Right Reason leads us to
Faith, but leavs us there, and resigns
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:53793:78"/>
us up to it. If God were not omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent
he could not justly not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably
command us to believ
whatsoever he saith, but being such,
it is most irrationall not to believ
him: for this were to confine the
Infinite Creator of all things within
the Finite Circle of this World and
the Sphere of Nature, which is the
utmost extent of the Ken of Reason.
Surely this whole Universe is but a
small portion of his power &amp; work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manship,
who is able to create new
Worlds, and a new Nature of
things: but this is the most naturall
corruption of the Mind of Man, to
exalt it self against the Glory of
God, by setting up Naturall Light
against Faith, as Works against
Grace, and so confine God within
our Compass, as Conjurers deal
with Spirits, Certainly <hi>Adam</hi> in his
primitive state was generally capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of believing any Divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
which were or might be
presented unto him. That very
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:53793:79"/>
Commandment concerning the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
fruit was a Statute specially
enacted and published by God, and
no part of the Common Law writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in his hart: and his first sin was
Infidelity, since which we are all
naturally most prone to it, and the
Saving Grace or Remedy is Faith:
<hi>Adams</hi> Faith was a work whereby
he was to be justified, and the chief
part of his obedience, and such a
Faith was also in Christ the second
<hi>Adam</hi> believing in God concerning
those things which as Man he could
not foreknow. But this Kind differs
much from Evangelicall Faith, which
doth not justifie as a work, but as an
Instrumentall Mean, whereby we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
unto our selvs the Merits of
another. Yet though there be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
in Mans Nature Faith as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well
as Reason, there is no saving
Faith left in him but only such a
malignant Faith as is in the Divels,
for as the Naturall man cannot
know the things of God by a Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticall
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:53793:79"/>
Knowledge, producing Love
and Obedience, unless he be first
taught of God, so neither can he so
know Christ nor believ in him, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
it be given to him to believ.
<hi>This is Life Eternall, that they might
know thee the only true God, and Iesus
Christ him whom thou hast sent.</hi> God
is said to confound the wisdome of
the Wise by the Gospel of Faith,
which declareth unto them, that
without believing they cannot be
saved, and yet without a superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
Grace they cannot believ.
Thus being confounded in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and not knowing how to
escape, they break through all, and
will not allow others that Faith
which they have not themselvs
though they cannot deny that it is
possible for God to do that which
is believed nor is it improbable that
he should make them believ it for
whom he hath prepared it. As God
is the chief Good and perfect Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
of the soul, so by Faith, which
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:53793:80"/>
is the highest Knowledge we have in
this world, the Soul enjoyes him, and
by him the most excellent Gifts and
Graces whereof it is capable.</p>

Of the Scriptures.</head>
               <p>THe Scripture of Word of God
in Paradise was the Morall
Law written in Mans heart, and the
revelation of extraordinary com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.
After the fall God immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly
preached to <hi>Adam,</hi> &amp; while the
Church was confined within Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
lie taught them by Visions and
Revelations; but when he began
to found the Nationall Church of
the Jews, he delivered unto them
written Laws and the Examples of
former times, from the very first
Creation, and so proceeded by
Propheticall revelation to the End
of the World, and then was the
Scripture finished and sealed up by
the last of the Apostles, as a perfect
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:53793:80"/>
Institution, or Pandect of all things
requisite to be known or believed
for the salvation of Man. The First
Evidence of the Divinity of the
Scripture, is that of all other
Books in the world, it most clearly
and familiarly discovers unto us
the God of Nature in a most glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
and worthy manner. The Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
this, that the Morall Law, and
the summ of all Duties toward God
and Man are in it most perfectly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared.
Though since the fall there
may still remain in the Mind of
Man some scattered fragments and
obscure characters thereof, yet they
are so much defaced and disordered,
that they cannot be plainly read,
nor otherwise restored then by set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
forth the second Edition by the
same Author, according to the first
Originall: without which we might
have spent our whole Lives, as the
Philosophers did, in doubting and
disputing, while we should be
practicing and obeying. The Third,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:53793:81"/>
that it fully describeth the whole
History of the world from the first
Creation to the Dissolution there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of;
joining with those Precepts of
the Law the Examples and Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of all Ages. The Last, that the
Divine Sentence, <hi>Nosse teipsum,</hi> of
which <hi>Iuvenal</hi> saith, <hi>Coelo descendit,</hi>
is not only prescribed herein, but
also performed by this clear Mirror,
whereby the Face of the Soul and
the Secrets of the Hart are made
manifest; and therefore we ought
to confess that God is in it of a
truth. These Arguments which are
naturall and rationall Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
may be some perswasion to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev
these supernaturall Truths with
which they are accompanied. As a
man whom we know to be grave
and true in all his other Discourses,
is the more credited in relating
things strange and wonderfull: or
as <hi>Socrates</hi> said of the writings of
<hi>Heraclitus,</hi> What he understood was
very good, and so he did believ
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:53793:81"/>
that to be which he understood not.
And in the matters of Faith which
the Scriptures revele unto us there is
no Unreasonableness, though they
are above Reason, nor Inconsistency
among themselvs, yea the wholy
Symmetry and Analogy of Faith is
more glorious and beautifull then
the very Law of Nature and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
it self. This blessed Harmony
and just Proportion is the surest <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex</hi>
of all the parts, and the best
Interpreter of the most doubtfull
points: the neglect whereof hath
introduced all Errors and Heresies
in the Church, which are no other
then the Monstrous Mutilations,
Excrescences, or Distortions of the
particular Members of the Body of
Faith not corresponding to the
Whole, commonly occasioned by
wresting the Text, or too curious
criticising upon it. Though that
which is pick'd out of it sometimes
may be true in it self, yet if it be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the scope and meaning, it is a
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:53793:82"/>
belying of the Holy Spirit, making
him speak that which he never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended:
and this emboldens to
do the like another time, for the
maintaining of such Opinions as are
neither true in this Text, nor in the
Thing. This is the dangerous Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor
of our Age, wherein men hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
after new Notions and sublime
Mysteries, gather up all these Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goricall
and Sophisticall Expositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which <hi>Calvin</hi> and other sound
Textuaries have with great Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
rejected, and so patch up a
new kind of Divinity with these
<hi>Cento's</hi> of Scripture and their own
specious Conceptions and strange
Fansies. As for the Stile of Scripture,
it is very admirable, though by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the Idioms of the Times and
Languages wherein it was wrote it
may now seem to us uncouth
and strange; yet, if we rightly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
it, we shall finde in it a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
mixture of Simplicity and
Majesty, Perspicuity and Mystery,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:53793:82"/>
being sometimes dark and cloudy,
and sometimes again thundring and
lightning, and shooting flashes of
sacred fire into the hart of the
Reader, piercing even to the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

and of the Joints and Marrow. The

is used as a Charm or Exor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

proved an holy spell to <hi>Francis Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi>
metamorphosing him from
an Atheist to a Christian. I cannot
but wonder how <hi>Politian,</hi> or any
judicious Critik, could so far under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value
the Scripture, as to disparage
and despise it. Certainly, though it
express not so much elegancy as to
humor vain minds, yet it hath suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to defend it self from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
and is most apt and genuine
for the Divine matter which it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth:
we may justly suspect
they never faithfully studied it, nor
well relished the matter and scope
thereof; and then no wonder if
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:53793:83"/>
they contemn it, as many Wise men
do their <hi>Tully</hi> and <hi>Virgil,</hi> because
they were never well versed in
them, nor rightly understand their
Art and Intention. But a true Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,

                  <hi>IN the beginning God created the

made the World, and no Ey saw

and best knows how and when he
will do it, hath most evidently set it
forth in his Word: whereas the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers
speak doubtfully of it,
and are strangely perplexed and
troubled about it. Divine Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
proceeds from Causes to Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,
and begins with God the first
Cause of all things: but they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:53793:83"/>
to the way of Humane Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
proceed from Effects to Causes,
and so travailing to the utmost end
of Natures Firm Land, find out those
first created Principles of Matter,
and Atomes which are but the Dust
of Matter, and a Chaos or Heap of
all things, and discovering nothing
beyond these but a Vast Ocean and
Gulf of Infinity, rather turn back
into the bosome of Nature, and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe
this self-creating power, which
is infinite and eternall, to those low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
and meanest things, then to an
infinite and eternall Creator, though
God seemeth purposely so to have
ordered the Course of Nature that
the most perfect things should be
constituted of things less perfect,
that thereby we might be led on to
the acknowledgement of him: for if
the Superior Natures, as Angels and
Men, had produced the inferior, we
might more reasonably have sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
them to be the first Causes of
themselvs and others: but to deify
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:53793:84"/>
Matter, or Atomes, and make them
our Creators, is most irrationall.
Though Philosophy seems to doubt
it, yet all Religions and all Nations
have confessed an Eternall Creator.
Every Creature is a Letter of his
Name, and the beautifull Fabrike of
the whole World plainly spels a
Deity: and as the Creatures prove
a Creator, so also they prove both
what he is not, that is, not like them,
finite and vain; and in some sort
what he is, that is, the infinite per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of all these excellencies
which are in them, and infinitely
more in himself then them all. Thus
<hi>David</hi> argues. <hi>He that planted the
Ear shall he not hear, and he that
framed the Ey shal not he see, He that
teacheth Man Knowledge shall not he
know?</hi> That is God in his own Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
and Infinite manner doth see,
and hear, and understand all things,
as we do in our finite and imperfect
manner: the Excellency thereof
must be attributed to him, but the
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:53793:84"/>
Imperfection must be removed
from him. So he is said to be angry
at sin, that is, he is a perfect enemy
to all Sin; but Passion and Offense,
which is an Infirmity in us, may not
be conceived of him. Thus God
himself vouchsafeth to condiscend
to our capacities, interpreting and
translating himself into our Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
by Anthropopathies and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thropomorphies,
and the like. If
we might only speak properly of
him, it were impossible for us to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
or apprehend him: for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can be univocally predicated
of God, and the Creature, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
an infinite disproportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them. So God is infinitely
Good not by any multiplication of
degrees above us which do not alter
the <hi>Species</hi> of Goodness, but in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
kind of Infinite Goodness, for
no multiplication of degrees can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise
to an Infinity. As our Savior
said. <hi>There is none Good but God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> that
is, as he is Good; so we may also
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:53793:85"/>
say, There is none but God, that
is, as he is whose Name is <hi>Iam.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
our Notions of Essence and
Goodness being Finite, the expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
thereof cannot perfectly declare
him who is Infinite, and therefore
are not properly predicated of him:
but those and the like highest Titles
of Nature, as <hi>Substance, Spirit, Act,</hi>
must be understood of him infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
otherwise then of us: for, <hi>To
whom shall we liken God, or what like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
shall we compare unto him?</hi> He
is that Rule of Goodness, that Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
and Metaphysicall Good
whereof we speak at large, and
therefore Abstracts do better ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
him, then Concretes and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectives.
He is <hi>Being, Bonity, Power,
Wisdom, Iustice, Mercy it self,</hi> and so
it is said, <hi>God is Love,</hi> not properly,
but potentially and infinitly, and as
he is One, because he is Infinite, so
also because he is Infinite all these
must necessarily be One in him, yea
One with himself: for an Infinite
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:53793:85"/>
cannot consist of Parts, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be all Infinite, because they are
many, and if they be Finite, cannot
make up one Infinite. Therefore the
highest conception we can have of
God is, that he is <hi>One Infinite Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
in himself,</hi> which is eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and virtually all Perfections of the
Creatures: and the most perfect
knowledge we have of him is, that
we cannot perfectly know him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
we do know him to be thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitly
perfect: yet is this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
sufficient to make us perfectly
happy in the enjoiment of him,
whom we know to be virtually and
effectually all Finite Good, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
Good in himself. Let us
therefore look round about the
whole frame of Nature, and view
all the parts thereof, considering all
their Excellencies as so many Raies
of Divine Glory, whereof he is the
Sun from which they proceed, and
on whom they depend, compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending
all in himself as their first
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:53793:86"/>
Cause, in whom they were potenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
before they were created. Then
let us ascend above the highest Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
and the whole Compass of
Nature, which cannot contain him,
and go forth out of this World into
that vast and boundless Temple of
Immensity and Eternity which he
inhabiteth, and at once universally
possesseth, and so return into the
bosome of that Infinity out of
which we have proceeded. Let us
consider the possible effects of an
unlimitted Power, and we shall
find Worlds very cheap with him,
who made this great Globe out of
nothing. Let us contemplate that
Infinite Goodness which exceedeth
all Covetousness, and that Glory
which surpasseth all Ambition, and
ground all upon the reall foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Being it self, and so fill and
overwhelm our selvs in this Ocean
of endless Perfection. From this
hight of Contemplation let us look
back again upon the World, which
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:53793:86"/>
will appear to us but as a shadow
of his Being, a Molehill full of busy
Ants, or a show of self-moving Pup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets,
acting their parts upon a Stage
set up for that purpose, which must
be taken down when the Play is
done. This is true Liberty and Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Mind, full of truth and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,
and worthy our selvs whom
God hath made capable thereof.
They who travail over diverse
Countries, thereby greatly enlarge
their Spirits, and reflect upon that
corner of the Earth in which they
were born with other Eies then
when they set forth; The fansy of
<hi>Lucian,</hi> who placeth <hi>Charon</hi> on the
top of an high hill viewing all the
affairs of living men, and looking
on their greatest Cities as litle Birds
nests, is very pleasant. <hi>Socrates</hi> by
making himself a Citizen of the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverse,
became an Universall Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.
But all those Contemplations
are still bounded within the Circle
of a finite Nature. Let us escape out
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:53793:87"/>
of this Prison of the World, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>franchise
our Souls by restoring
them to their native and perfect Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.
Let us realize and eternize
all things by enjoying them in him
who is All in All, which is such an
Ingredient in all our Good things,
as doth not only Sanctify, but Deify
them, and without which they are
as vain and nothing in the Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as they are in their own Being
without him. Thus the Soul being
united to God by that Union, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes
of his Unity and Universality,
resting on him as in its Center, and
enjoying all the Creatures as so
many Lines Streaming from him,
and again reflecting unto him,
having no other Inclination, Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
nor End, but only God himself,
in whom it dwells and abides for

which is a World of Mysteries and

chiefly of Nature and Reason. Now
these being two severall Worlds or
Natures of things, it is as irrationall
to measure matters of Faith by
Reason, as it is to weigh the Aire,
or measure a Spirit. It begins with
the great Mystery of Mysteries, the
Trinity, and so proceeding to the
Incarnation of the Son of God, end<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
in our Mysticall Union with Christ
and God. The Deity of the Creator
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:53793:88"/>
may be plainly proved by the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,
which is the Work and Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
thereof, but Divines say that the
Works of the Trinity out of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selvs
are undivided, and so nothing
in Nature can lead us to that distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of Persons in the Godhead,
nor demonstrate it to us. Yet there
is nothing in this great Mystery
contrary to Reason, though it be
far above it: for they are not three
Infinites, not three and one in the
same consideration, but three in
one, that is, three Persons in one
Nature. The Nature and Unity of
God are both Infinitely diverse
from ours, &amp; therefore unless Finite
Reason should limit Infinity, it must
acknowledge that it may be so, and
Faith beleeveth that it is so: but
neither Reason nor Faith can pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
comprehend how it is so, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is infinitely and incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensibly
so. The Incarnation of the
Son of God is a Mystery almost as
wonderfull as the former, and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:53793:88"/>
setteth forth the Mystery of
the other: for God the Son only is
incarnate, and not God the Father,
nor God the Holy Ghost, though
they all equally partake of the same
Divine Nature which is incarnate.
Besides there are two Natures infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
diverse united in one Person.
Therefore Arrians and Socinians
who deny the Divinity of Christ, do
also deny the Trinity, which is the
ground thereof. This Mystery is so
far above all naturall Reason, that it
cannot possibly be comprehended
by it, and therefore most improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to be the Invention or Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
thereof: for certainly Reason
would rather have produced some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
like it self, or at least that
which it might in some sort com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend,
as all false Religions have
done. The sinfulness of all men doth
evidently demonstrate the necessity
of a Savior, and the nature of sin,
being a transgression of the Divine
Law of the Creator, binding the
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:53793:89"/>
Creature to perfect and perpetuall
obedience, shews the necessity of a
Divine Savior. <hi>There is no other
Name under Heaven given among
men whereby we may be saved,</hi> nor
hath any Religion or Philosophy
offered to the World any other
probable way of Mans Salvation:
and yet the Mind of Man is natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
so far from Saving Faith, that it
hardly entertains an Historicall
Faith of Christs Divinity and Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.
Men have stretched their
Reason and Fansy to the utmost to
find out any other way of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
rather then accept of this which
is most Glorious and Divine. Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers
seem to weigh our Virtues
with our Vices, and according to
the preponderation of either, deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
us Good or Bad, and so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver,
us up to Reward or Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
Whereas Man being bound
to perfect obedience to the very ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
capacity of his Nature, the
least Sin attaints the Soul, as one Act
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:53793:89"/>
of Treason makes a Traitor. The
Poets Fansy a Purgatory in another
world wherein all are to be clensed
and purified, as <hi>Virgil</hi> describes
it,

But though we should admit of
such a washing away the Filth of
sin, yet this is no abolition of the
Guilt. Imprisonment is no paiment,
and punishment no satisfaction, but
the perpetuall Vengeance of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satisfied
Justice; and can no more
restore a past defect, then make that
which is done to be undone. <hi>Iulian</hi>
the Apostate in despight of Christ
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:53793:90"/>
set up a Poeticall Savior, <hi>Aescula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius</hi>
the God of Physike, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
down in the beams of the Sun
his father should purge the World
from Sin and Evill. But this is a
Creed of his own making, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
by none but himself. Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenish
Religion taught the purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
away of sin by the bloud of
Bulls and Goats; which shows the
common opinion of the World,
that there should be some bloudy
Sacrifice for sin. But certainly if a
mans own sufferings cannot expiate
Sin, much less the Suffering of Brute
Creatures <hi>Mahomet</hi> and others
have pretended to be Saviors of the
World, but none knows how, nor
doth all their Doctrine hold forth
any probable Color or Shadow of
effecting it: whereas the Incarnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of that Son of God who took
upon him the Humanity, to that
very end that he might satisfy for
Man, and so was no otherwise obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to obedience, and by his Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:53793:90"/>
infuseth an Infinite Virtue into
all his merits, and is able to rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate
aswell as redeem, doth most
perfectly sute with our necessities,
and fully supply them. His own
Doctrine, Life, and Death are the
best Arguments of his Divinity, yet
doth he not want other testimonies,
The Sacrifices of the Patriarchs and
the Jewish Types, did prefigure
him. The Prophets were his Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bingers
to bespeak places and sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
for him. The Martyrs his He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralds
to proclaim him to the World,
dying in that Belief which the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Man so much opposeth; and
the whole World either hath or
shall both persecute and embrace it.
The third great Mystery is our U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with God and Christ, who
hath praied, <hi>that we might be one as
he and his Father are one;</hi> not Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentially,
nor Personally, but Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually,
so as no other Creature is
united to God. For Man being
made last of all the Creatures, as the
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:53793:91"/>
summ and <hi>Epitome</hi> of the rest, Christ
by taking upon him the Humane
Nature, invested himself with the
whole World; and though he hath
purchased all the inferior Creatures
for the use of Man, and the Elect
Angels as ministring Spirits may par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
of a Confirmation in their
good estate, yet the Conjugall Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is contracted between God and
Mankind in a more speciall and
immediate manner. Nor is this a
Naturall Union, such as was that
between <hi>Adam</hi> and all his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity,
whereby sin is derived to
them, but Spirituall by a more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
&amp; personall application, Christ
apprehending us by his Spirit, and
we him by Faith. Now as the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of God and the Soul is that
wherein our Happiness consists, so
this being the highest &amp; neerest U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
advances Man to a further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
therof then any other Creature
whatsoever. And this is the highest
Evidence of the Mediatorship of
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:53793:91"/>
Jesus Christ. For God being Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite,
and the whole World Finite,
and so Infinitely below him, though
after he had perfected the first Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,
<hi>he rested from his Works,</hi> yet
he rested not in them as in his Son,
whom he begat from all Eternity, &amp;
in whom he only rests satisfied, and
declared from Heaven that he is well
pleased. And though he pronounc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them <hi>very good,</hi> that is, in their
kind, yet in respect of himself, who
only is truly and Infinitely Good,
they are all as Vain and Null. But
Jesus Christ thus Espousing the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,
and Endowing it with his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity,
gathers up all in himself, &amp; so
presents both together as an Object
Infinite and adaequate to his Father.
Let us therefore entertain this bless<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Savior with the full embraces of
our Soul, and think no other thing
worthy our affections who have
such a glorious Object presented
unto us. When we read the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of mighty Kings, and the great
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:53793:92"/>
Captains of the World, our Minds
are filled with honorable thoughts
of them, and we applaud them with
great delight. The very Romances
of Heroike Love work strangely
upon our Fansies, and we are ready
with the Tyrant to wish over selvs a
part in them; whereas here we have
the only Son of God, the King of
Glory, the mighty Conqueror of
Principalities and Powers, yea of
Death, and Hell, and Sin, triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
over all the strength of Evill,
<hi>the chiefest among ten thousand, yea
fairer then the Children of men, The
brightness of his Fathers Glory, and
express Image of his Person,</hi> who
having set his hart on the most
wretched and deformed Soul of
Man, left his Fathers Court, laid
aside his Roiall Robes, taking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him, not the Disguise, but <hi>the
Form of a servant,</hi> living in the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est,
and laying down his life in the
basest and most cruell manner, for
her sake, whose Love was less then
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:53793:92"/>
her Desert, and Enmity against him
greater then her Misery, Espousing
her to himself, and at once infusing
both Love, and Beauty, putting his
own Crown upon her Head, and so
bringing her home to his Fathers
House to live with himself in eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
Bliss. This is the high Peroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
of Divine Love, to love the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lovely,
and make them Lovely; to
purchase the Poor, and make them
Rich; to affect the Unwilling, and
make them Willing; to pity the
Miserable, and make them Happy; <hi>O
my Lord, and my God! thou Beauty
of all Beauties, and Perfection of all
Perfections! The God of Love, yea
Love it self! Teach me the Law of
Divine Love, and enflame me with
this Celestiall flame, inspire me with
thine own Spirit, and let me live in
thy Life, rejoycing in the pure foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of thy Ioy, and resting in the
Bosom of thy eternall Rest.</hi>

               <p>WE enjoy God only in

There is a Spirituall Drunkenness
and Madness, which in some is so
strong and prevalent, that it ends in
a naturall Madness, and distemper
of the brain, which is hurt and taint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the vehement impression of
these Imaginations as much as with
the Fansies of Carnall Love, or
Pride, or any other violent affections
which commonly distract men, <hi>Be not
drunk with Wine wherein is excess,
but be filled with the Spirit,</hi> saith the
Apostle, shewing, that in Wine, and
in all the spirits of Creatures there
may be excess and inebriatiation,
only the Spirit of God doth fill and
satisfy the Soul with Spirituall
Grace, which yet some who would
seem more Spirituall then others
least regard, and rather affect extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
and miraculous Gifts which
have ceased long since: having been
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:53793:94"/>
chiefly exercised in three extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
seasons and upon extraordina-occasions;
by <hi>Moses</hi> who deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Law to the <hi>Iews;</hi> by <hi>Elias</hi>
and <hi>Elisha</hi> who restored the Law
which they had made void; and
lastly by Christ and his Apostles who
preached the Gospel, with the last
of whom they seem to have expired:
for soon after when the ceasing of
the Heathenish Oracles was objected
by the Christians against <hi>Iulian</hi> the
Apostate, he retotred upon them
the ceasing of their Prophecies.
Some suppose that these extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Gifts shall be restored unto the
Church when she shall be fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
out of the Antichristian
Eclips, but why might we not rather
expect to have found them in our
first Reformers. <hi>Luther</hi> was a man
of an extraordinary Faith, and yet
wrought no Miracles. The Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists
at the same time affected
them, and pretended to them, but
were found Vain and Fanatike.
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:53793:94"/>
Though some of them were meer
Impostors, yet others verily believed
that they were divinely inspired.
The Miracles of Saints and Martyrs
since the Apostolicall times seem ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Legends and Fables then cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible
Stories. The confident per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions
of a strong, Faith may seem
somewhat like a Prophecy, though
far different from it, and of another
kind: and so the Judgements of
some wise men have been taken
for Predictions; whereas Prophecy
is not so much the confirmation of a
mans own Spirit in the ordinary
way of believing or judging, as an
extraordinary revelation of Future
things immediately and expresly by
God, perhaps in a rapture or extasy,
when he who uttereth it, least un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandeth
it. Also there may be a
power of casting out Divels by
Praier and Fasting; which is not
now to be performed as formerly
by any speciall Gift, with a word of
command certainly effecting it; but
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:53793:95"/>
in the ordinary way of Praier,
which God is pleased to honor
with an equall effect. There are also
Miracles of Providence as we may
so call them, whereby God is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to deliver his Church out of her
greatest streights in an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
manner, and by unexpected
means, as he did formerly by Signs
and Wonders, and Miracles of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
Such was the recovery of
<hi>Germany</hi> by the same hand which
first betraied the Protestant Cause:
<hi>Maurice Duke of Saxony</hi> after all
his Successes and Preferment,
strangely revolting from <hi>Charles
the fifth</hi> to the contrary party: the
defeating of the Spanish <hi>Aramado,</hi>
as <hi>Drake</hi> termed it, with Squibs; the
discovery of the Gunpowder Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
by a Letter, or whatsoever o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Indicium</hi> there was of it: yea
the preservation of Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
in all Ages, maugre all Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions
and Heresies, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storing
of it in these latter dayes
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:53793:95"/>
without a Miracle, is none of the
least Miracles. Certainly the clear
revelation of the Mysteries of Faith,
and the manifestation of the Graces
of Gods Spirit in the Harts and
Lives of men are evident testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
that God hath not forsaken his
Church; the least dram of true
Grace being more valuable then all
Miraculous Gifts whatsoever, and
the principall end thereof. As for
Enthusiasms and Revelations they
were of use in former times, and
very necessary before Scripture was
finished, being either Scripture, or
instead of Scripture; but since <hi>St.
Iohns</hi> time, who wrote the last
Book of Scripture in the <hi>Isle of
Pathmos</hi> under <hi>Domitian,</hi> they seem
also to have ceased: for if this were
true they ought to be believed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
with Scripture, being the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
and infallible Word of
God as well as it, which is now the
only rule and measure of Faith, suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to make the man of God
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:53793:96"/>
perfect. But all those Fansies are
not so dangerous as other Spirituall
Errors in the Foundation and Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentials
of Faith, to which such
Spirits are very prone, striving to
ascend above Truth asmuch as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
fall short of it. Thus by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alting
the free Grace and Spirit of
God they destroy the Morall Law,
and with the Penalty take away the
Precept or Commanding power;
though the Law be as obligatory in
it self and prevalent over the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
of a Good man without it as
with it, and most perfectly consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent
with Grace, which enableth us
to perform what the Law com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth.
Others trample on the
very Ordinances and Duties of the
Gospel, presuming to finde a neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
way to Heaven then God hath
appointed. There are new fashions
and dresses of Religion very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
and popular, as all Novelties
are, especially such as seem more sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime
and Spirituall. But the old
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:53793:96"/>
Orthodox Truth, is the best, and still
prevaileth at last. There is no Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
in the world which hath been
so curiously scanned and throughly
sifted in every Point and <hi>Puntilio</hi>
thereof, as Christianity: the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Scepticisms, and most subtile Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticisms
and niceties of Wit have
been exercised about it, and the
whole Body thereof like the Body
of our Savior hanging upon the
Cross, vexed and tortured in every
joint, and yet it continues whole
and entire; though there may be
some prints of the Nails and Spears
of Heretikes remaining upon it, yet
not a bone thereof may be broken,
which plainly proves it to be Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
&amp; Divine, preserved only by
the Author of it. <hi>Paracelsus</hi> threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
that he would deal with the
Pope &amp; <hi>Luther</hi> as he had done with
<hi>Galen</hi> and <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and probably if
he had undertaken it we should have
had some such Mercuriall Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy
from him as is now vented in
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:53793:97"/>
our times. The difference seems
not much unlike. Sound Divines, like
Galenists administer solid and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiall
Truth, whereas our Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celsian
Preachers deal in Quintes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sences
and Spirits, and the like Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mistry
of Divinity, and cloth them
with strange words and Mysticall
expressions. Divinity hath found
the same usage in these times with
all other Arts and Sciences, and the
same Humor of this fantastike Age
runs through all. Men think to
advance Learning by fine Conceits
and strong Lines, as they call them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
which have enervated the solid part
thereof: so do these emasculate Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
by their vain Opinions and
quaint Expressions. There is no
greater Bane of true Piety then Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
on the right hand, and sublime
Heresy; especially when it grows
Popular and is generally received.
Yet Truth is no less Truth though
all the World should be in an Error.
One <hi>Athanasius</hi> may stand to his
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:53793:97"/>
Creed in the midst of an Arrian
Empire. As a man who sees the Sun
shine, though all others should say
the contrary, is no whit less as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
of it, because he sees it. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
we can hardly guess at things
which are before us, how much less
can we find out Spirituall and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Truth, or practice what we
know? Let us therefore pray to
God for his Spirit, who first reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
it to the world, and who only
can lead us into all Truth, and into
all Grace, which is our true Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>

               <head>VII.
Of a Christian Life.</head>
               <p>THe great work of the Spirit of
God in our Harts is the new
Creature, and the effect thereof
new Life. <hi>Christian Life is the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joiment
of all things,</hi> for enjoying
Christ, who is Heir of all things, and
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:53793:98"/>
hath purchased all with his bloud,
we enjoy all things by a new and
better Title, and in a more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
and Spirituall manner, as the
Fruits of his Redemption, and Gifts
of his Love. It is generally affimed
by Divines, that true Grace chiefly
respects Gods Glory, and our own
Happiness in a subsequent and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior
manner, so that we should be
willing to suffer even the pains of
Hell it self for the Glory of God;
which is a fine Notion and an high
Expression: but if rightly consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
we shall find no such distinction
in the Thing it self. Indeed if we
take Happiness for a releaf from
Pains, or a Paradise of Pleasure, or
any other thing then the very en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joiment
of God and Christ, it is a
true Sentence: but the highest Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
of the Soul being that very
enjoiment, the one cannot be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
nor really distinguished
from the other. He who truly loves
the Person of another, without any
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:53793:98"/>
collaterall respects, loves to love it,
and this Love being most true and
pure is also must lovely and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.
Thus doth Divine Love pay it
self, and as Virtue, so much more
Grace, is its own Reward. This is
that blessed Communion and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partnership
of profit and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
which God affordeth us with
himself, which is no equalling of our
selvs with him, but consists in the
very subordination of our selvs to
him. To glorify him is our highest
Glory, to bless him our truest Bless<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness:
his Will and our Good do
most perfectly and intirely concen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
To divide these, is to cut in
sunder the very intrinsecall bond of
our Union with him: and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
apprehension is the greatest
deceit and highest prejudice that can
be against the service of God: for
it keeps the Soul at a perpetuall
distance, and frights it out of the
way of Piety: whereas the right
understanding hereof ingages it
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:53793:99"/>
most fully and freely, with the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
embraces of Duty and Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit.
As true Philosophy resolvs Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty
into Utility, so doth true Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity
resolv<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Grace into Glory.
While the Soul remains corrupt and
contrary to God, it cannot enjoy
him nor any Happiness in him, but
a new Nature begets new Principles
and new Enjoiments: and it being
the highest perfection of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to be conformable to God and
united to him, is also our highest
Happinness: for the perfection of
every Nature affordeth the greatest
and truest Pleasure. Now what can
we rationally desire more then to
be most Happy? why then should
we not rather desire a right consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
of Soul which produceth true
Happiness, then the false Happiness
of a corrupt Mind? Sin is as much
against every mans generall and
implicite Intention, which is to be
Happy, as it is against Gods express
Command, which is that we should
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:53793:99"/>
be Holy. Nor doth the Command
of God and his absolute Sovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
over us diminish the freest Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of a rectified Soul. <hi>Perfectum
imperium cum perfecta libertate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistit.</hi>
God is Good, and doth Good,
and commands nothing but Good:
which is but like the Latine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement,
<hi>Iubeo te valere,</hi> I bid you
farewell. By Conversion the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
Will is made a Willing
Will, and to such the Command of
God sounds only thus, Do what
you will. A wicked man saith, <hi>Quod
libet licet,</hi> but a Godly man inverts
it, <hi>Quod licet libet.</hi> Thus most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturally
and harmoniously hath
the great Creator and Governor of
the World subordinated all to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
without the least discord or of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.
It is sin which hath wrought
all confusion and malignity in our
Nature, and all the mischief in the
VVorld. As our Being is founded
in our dependance on God, so is
our VVell-being in our subordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:53793:100"/>
to him, and it is impossible it
should be otherwise. The perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his Nature is to be perfectly
supreme, and the perfection of our
Nature is to be perfectly subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
and subject to him, whose <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
is perfect Freedome.</hi> Thus we
enjoy all things in him as they are
eminently in himself, and as he
giveth us all things richly to enjoy.
As a VVoman married to a Rich
man enjoieth him and all his estate,
though she useth no more thereof
then what is fit for her, which is the
right enjoyment of all. God maketh
<hi>all things work together for the
best to them that love him,</hi> and so
they enjoy the best of all; aswell
of that which he giveth, as of that
which he denieth. <hi>Adam</hi> should
have enjoied the forbidden fruit by
forbearing, and not by eating: as
Sin is a Privation of Good, so the
only enjoiment thereof is Privative,
or Relative to Grace, which is the
Contrary thereof: and as it is Duty
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:53793:100"/>
to omit things which are to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
so it a kind of Enjoiment
not to use things which are not to
be used. It is the great Error of
Men, that they cannot understand
this kind of Enjoiment aswell as the
other, but are taken with every bait
of Pleasure, and led captive by the
Divell at his will: finding some sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Delight in sinfull Pleasures, as a
corrupt Stomach longeth for cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
Food, and abhorreth that
which is better and more whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some.
But unless the Divell could
turn the Tables of the VVorld, and
put God and his party to the loos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
side, it is most impossible that
there should be any true Happiness
in any other thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or in any other
way then as he hath appointed
and prescribed. Nor can it be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably
imagined that God should
suffer his friends to loose by him, or
his Enemies to shark any thing from
him who is Lord of all. If Intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
could afford more pleasure
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:53793:101"/>
then Temperance, <hi>Heliogabalus</hi>
should have been more happy then
<hi>Adam</hi> in Paradise: yea if there were
the least reall delight in Sin there
could be no perfect Hell, where men
shall most perfectly Sin, and most
perfectly be tormented with their
Sins, which are the prepared fuell
thereof, &amp; though now they neither
glow or burn, shall then consume
them with unquenchable fire. Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
men, like Prodigals, live riotous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and run in debt for it; but the
time will come when they must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pay
both Principall and Interest,
and so shall gain nothing by all
their Voluptuousness. <hi>Sardanapalus</hi>
his Accompt was not rightly cast
up. <hi>Haec habui quae edi</hi>—for he
lost more by what he spent, then by
what he left. We will now descend
to the Particulars of this Universall
Enjoiment of a Christian Life.</p>

Of Nature.</head>
               <p>THe first part of a Christian Life
is the Enjoyment of Nature,
and of the VVorks of God, wherein
a Christian far excelleth the wisest
Philosopher, and moves above him
in his own Sphere. Vulgar Minds
view the face of Nature, as a Brute
Beast doth a Picture, regarding on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Surface and Show rudely and
at large. The Philosopher, as an
Artist, contemplates the curious
VVorkmanship thereof, observing
with much pleasure and delight the
proper Colors, and comely Features
and Shadows, and the whole Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posure
of the beautifull Image; as
the Painter answered him who
wondered at his gazing on an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Piece. O, said he, if you
had mine eies you would be affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with it as I am<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But a Christian
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:53793:102"/>
looks upon Nature, as a Lover doth
on the Picture of his Beloved, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting
more in the Resemblance
then in the Table. Thus <hi>David</hi>
rightly enjoyed Nature in his pious
Contemplations thereof. So he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
his excellent Hymn of the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
of the VVorld. <hi>Bless the
Lord O my soul! O Lord my God
thou art very great! Thou art clothed
with Honor and Majesty! Thou co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verest
thy self with Light as with a
Garment!</hi> &amp;c. and he concludes
in the same manner, <hi>I will sing unto
the Lord as long as I live, I will sing
praises unto the Lord while I have a
being, my meditation of him shall be
sweet, I will be glad in the Lord.</hi> So
when he reflects upon the litle
VVorld, Himself. <hi>I will praise thee,
for I am fearfully and wonderfully
made; marvailous are thy works,
and that my Soul knoweth right well.</hi>
So comparing both together. <hi>When
I consider the Heavens, the work of
thy fingers, the Moon and Starrs
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:53793:102"/>
which thou hast ordained, what is
Man that thou art mindfull of him,
and the Son of Man that thou visitest
him?</hi> &amp;c. Naturalists are much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
with the Sucly of Nature, and
Poets express a fluent and sweet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in describing her, but there is
more Life and Spirit and Angelicall
Speculation in one of <hi>Davids
Psalms</hi> then in all their writings;
this Spirituall use thereof being
more sublime and divine then any
naturall contemplations: as the
Cardinall plainly confessed, when
he found a Countriman meditating
on a Toad, and blessing God who
made him a Man. As <hi>Adam</hi> was
created in a state of Perfection, so he
had a great advantage of us in other
respects, being created in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
maturity of Understanding, and
rising up suddenly from the Earth
out of which he was taken, whereby
he had a quicker and fresher view
of the World then we whose Minds
are dulled through Custome and
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:53793:103"/>
Use, and the edge of our appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions
much rebated thereby. Let
us therefore make triall whither
the Imagination of such an advant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
may not somewhat excite and
sharpen our understanding. Let a
man suppose himself <hi>made,</hi> as <hi>David</hi>
speaks Metaphorically, <hi>in the lowest
parts of the Earth,</hi> in an adult State
of Body and Mind: Surely if he
could well discern it, he would judge
it to be the common dunghill of the
VVorld, and would wonder to find
any Metalls or Jewells hid in the
rubbish thereof. And then coming
neerer the Surface, and meeting
with heaps of rotten Carcases, and a
few noisome Living Creatures, he
would deem it a very Grave and
Hell of all things; and could never
expect that it should produce any
thing but filth and corruption. But
then lifting up his head above the
Ground, and seeing it covered with
the curious Tapestry of Herbs and
Flowers, spread for him as a
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:53793:103"/>
Prince to tread on, painted with
the variety of all pleasant Colors,
and perfumed with most fragrant
Odors, and enriched with many se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
and excellent Virtues; then
beholding the Armies of standing
Corn, and Forrests of goodly Trees
crowned with innumerable Leavs
and Fruits; and perceiving the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
kinds of Beasts and Birds, like
so many <hi>Automata</hi> or self-moving
Engins, stirring up and down about
him in their severall Postures and
Motions, he must needs stand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed
at so strange a sight, and
praise the fruitfulness of the womb
which bare them. But looking
back upon the deep and wide Sea
which threatens the shore with his
insulting waves, he would fear least
that roaring Monster should step in
among them, and swallow up all in
his devouring Jaws; till he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv
how when he is swoln to the
hight of his pride and fury, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
to retreat and fall back into
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:53793:104"/>
his native den, without doing the
least hurt, and fetches off the tall
ships, carrying them away upon his
Back, and furnishes all the Aquae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts
of the Earth with fresh
Springs and Streams, ministring
drink to the whole Family. Again,
considering the pure Aire which he
scarcely felt or perceived, and yet
is so far from Inanity that it fills up
all the Chinks and Cranies of the
VVorld, fanning the Earth with the
VVings of VVind, and driving the
great Ships to and fro with various
Gales of Breath, sometimes causing
a quiet Calm and universall peace
among the Elements, and suddenly
muffling the face of Heaven with
black Clouds, and rowsing up the
sleepy Ocean, tossing and tumbling
it over and over, and tearing the
Bowells of the Earth, making the
Sturdy Mountains to tremble, and
the Rocks cleav in sunder, is again
as suddenly pacified he knows not
how nor by whose perswasion; how
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:53793:104"/>
it carrieth about the Limbikes of
the Clouds which distill down fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
showers, and drop fatness on
the Earth, and in a moment con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey
all the Gifts and Blessings of
Heaven to it. Lastly, contemplating
those vast Orbs or Worlds of Light
in their swift Motions and perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
Courses, which never fail one
minute of their appointed Time,
nor wander an inch out of their
constant Way, blessing the Earth
with their very smiles, and illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
it with their Glorious Light;
he must necessarily acknowledge
and adore the great Creator, who
hath founded this stately Globe,
and doth manage the Universall
Empire of Nature by Secret Laws
and inward Principles. And though
he cannot discern him by outward
Sight, yet his Understanding will
as easily discover him, as it doth an
invisible Spirit in a living Body. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
as a Christian he tasts the bloud
of his Savior in all things, which
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:53793:105"/>
renders those reliques and frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of nature more sweet to him
then all the first Paradise of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
was to <hi>Adam.</hi>

Of Providence.</head>
               <p>A Theists, though partly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
by Nature, draw their
chief arguments against a Deity
from Providence and the present
state of things: whereas indeed this
is the greater argument against
them, and such as fortifies the other:
for had Nature still flowed in a
constant Stream of Causes and
Effects, she might more probably
have been supposed to be the only
Fountain of all things: but when
we see Nature, which alwaies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth
the Best, not able to fulfill
her own Laws, nor effect her In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions,
and so fall short of that
end which she prescribes to her self,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:53793:105"/>
we may plainly perceiv that there is
a higher Power which over-rules
her; <hi>for the Creature was made sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to Vanity, not willingly, but by
reason of him who hath subjected the
same in hope.</hi> Again, she being thus
lapsed and diseased might easily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay
and perish, if the same Power
did not still preserv and continue
her in all her <hi>Species,</hi> though Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidualls
dy daily. How litle excess
of drought or heat destroies the
hopes of the whole Year. A pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentiall
Aire may infect the whole
world, and an Age of successive
Famines and Pests might prove an
universall destruction of all Living
Creatures. <hi>But he left not himself
without witness, in that he doth good,
giving us rain from heaven, and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
seasons, and filling our harts with
food and gladness.</hi> Let a man serious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
consider how Strangely his own
Life is preserved; how many se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
Ingredients are requisite to
patch it up; how many sorts of
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:53793:106"/>
Materialls are necessary to build an
House; how many Utensiles to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
it; how many kinds of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
are spent in feeding him, and
almost as many in clothing him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
all other occasionall Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Life: and he may justly
wonder at the daily provision which
God hath made for him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Let him
also consider how many possible
Deaths lurk in his own bowells, and
the innumerable hosts of externall
Dangers which beleaguer him on
every side; how many invisible
Arrows fly about his ears continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
and yet how few have hit him,
and none hitherto mortally wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him; and he shall find the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of those things, which now
he so much neglects, strangely affect
him. <hi>Vives</hi> reports of a <hi>Iew,</hi> that
having gone over a deep river on a
narrow plank in a dark night, and
comming the next day to see what
danger he had escaped, fell down
dead with astonishment. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:53793:106"/>
sort of men walk in the dark,
and so regard not these things, but
like adventurous Soldiers are hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with past success, though their
fellows fall daily on every side.
Stoikes satisfy themselvs with their
Opinion of a Fatall Necessity, so
the <hi>Turks</hi> say, their Destinies are
written on their foreheads, which
is a desperate Humor, but no Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity:
and upon such a conceit to
neglect the means of our own pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation,
adds Guilt to Misery,
and deprives us of no small comfort
in suffering, that we were not wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to our selvs for the prevention
of it. But as it is the Destiny of such
men to perish, so it is their Destiny
to perish by their own folly, which
is a double Evill: And so <hi>Zeno</hi> the
Stoike could answer his servant whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
he would have excused his fault, by
pleading that it was his Fate: he
telling him, that it was his Fate also
to be beaten. Politicians think to
build above Providence, and to set
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:53793:107"/>
their Mountain so sure that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be moved: but how easily are
the greatest designs and wisest
counsells overturned by the least
and most unexpected accidents?
<hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> was a man of the larg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
abilities, and no less perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.
He so far prosecuted all
naturall means, as if no man had
more distrusted his Fortune, and yet
so much relied on his Fortune, as if
he had needed no other means:
when he was in that extremity
wherein he could make no use of his
Wit or Strength, he boasts of it,
and trusts to it alone: <hi>Caesarem ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>his
&amp; Fortunam ejus.</hi> He so often
succeeded well in such cases, that he
kept an <hi>Ephemeris</hi> thereof. God
who had ordained him to be the
Founder of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire did
strangely excite and support his
Spirit: and though it cannot be
presumed that he had any know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of Divine Revelations and
Prophecies concerning himself, yet
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:53793:107"/>
he seems to have had some kind of
Belief of the thing, I mean an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
Confidence and Assurance
of success. We shall find him as
great an Instance of Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
both in his Rise and Fall, as
ever was in the World. We will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
with his Civill War, and recite
only his own observations. First he
had the good hap to deal with an
Army without a Generall, and then
with a Generall without an Army:
both which met together might
probably have match'd him. He
was so put to it by <hi>Petreius</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>franius</hi>
at <hi>Ilerda in Spain,</hi> that it
was reported at <hi>Rome</hi> they had end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the War; which might have
been made good if <hi>Pompey</hi> had
come to their aid through <hi>Mauri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tania,</hi>
as was expected. Again, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the great Battail of <hi>Pharsalia,</hi>
when he was assaulted in his tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
he was so far worsted, that he
plainly confessed he had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered,
if <hi>Pompey</hi> then had known
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:53793:108"/>
how to conquer. Lastly, in the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail
of <hi>Munda</hi> he was put to fight
for his safety, as at other times for
Honor: <hi>Labienus</hi> only by wheeling
about with his Horse for advantage
was apprehended by the rest to fly,
and so resigned the Victory to him:
so small a matter doth many times
turn the Dy of War over and over,
and determine the greatest affairs
of the World: and the most secret
conspiracies many times leak and
run out at the least hole. <hi>Caesar</hi>
escaped a most imminent danger of
being murdered at supper in the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptian</hi>
Court, if the Conspirators
had then attempted it: and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
when they were fully
prepared for the action, his Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
who had no other direction
then the strange Instinct of a
naturall fearfulness, was thereby
put upon the search, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
the Treason: which was
as weak a Guard to his Person, as
the Geese to the <hi>Capitol,</hi> yet both
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:53793:108"/>
proved effectuall. But when God
had determined to ruine him, we
shall see how no advantages, no
warning could preserv him. He
alwaies held <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Cassius</hi> in
suspect, and professed some fear of
those pale lean fellows. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spirators
were many, the business
long in agitation, the danger fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told
by <hi>Spurinna,</hi> his wife dream'd
of it, and had almost staid him, Hee
had a Paper of the whole Plot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
into his hands as he was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Senate, and had begun to
read it; the Conspirators them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selvs
were daunted, and thought
they had been betrai'd, yet all this
could not preserv him from being
slain in the midst of the Senate, and
made a sacrifice to <hi>Pompeys</hi> Image.
Now let all the great Captains and
Counsellors of the World learn to
acknowledge an over-ruling Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and submit all their Power
and Policy to the Beck of a Divine
Will. A Christian enjoies Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:53793:109"/>
by referring himself to Gods
Protection, and so walks constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in a streight way in the midst of
all changes and vicissitudes with
aequanimity of Spirit, being most as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured,
that though he cannot well
understand the Particulars, yet the
Summ of all shall be Gods Glory
and his own Good, which is that
Happiness to which he is tending.</p>

Of Prosperity.</head>
               <p>PRosperity and Adversity are the
different Issues of the same Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
being the severall dispensations
of Providence: and as they have
the same Root, so they yield the
same Golden Fruit of Happiness.
<hi>I have learned,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>in
whatsoever state I am, therewith to be
content,</hi> Both may be enjoied with
Content, but learning and skill to
do it are requisite. Men think it an
easy thing to be happy in Prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:53793:109"/>
accounting that the only Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness;
though they know not
how to enjoy it. As if a Mariner
sailing with wind and tide he
knows not whither, should think
he is making a very good Voiage.
There is a silent and still stream of
Fortune, wherein some men swim
down quietly from the spring of
their Birth to the common Ocean
of Death, so that <hi>they do not much
remember the daies of their Life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
God answereth them in the joy
of their hart.</hi> This is that kind of
Prosperity so much commended by
Philosophers and Poets: <hi>Beatus
ille qui procul negotiis, &amp;c.</hi> A pretty
kind of idle Felicity, a Pastime,
or sweet Sleep, stealing away our
Time with the soft hand of ease and
rest, and at last shutting it up like a
fair Day in the common Darkness of
Death with others. There is also a
strong Gale of success carrying on
the Designs of some Great Men,
who adventure themselvs and all
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:53793:110"/>
their fortunes on the Ocean of the
World, in such a constant course of
Prosperity, that they never meet
with any cross winds. Many of the
<hi>Graecian</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Captains pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
alwaies victorious, and were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
beaten by any. Many rich men
thrive perpetually, and never suffer
any considerable loss: yet this is no
other then a busy Dream, or a Play
well acted: as <hi>Augustus</hi> the most
fortunate Prince intimated, who
when he was going off the Stage,
took his leav of his friends like an
Actor, <hi>Valete, et Plaudite.</hi> The right
way of enjoying Prosperity is
rightly to understand it, and the
true worth and nature of it. The
Covetous and Querulous, like sick
men, are never satisfied, but under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value
all the Good things which
they possess, and because they have
not what they would, neglect to
enjoy what they have. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
Prodigalls and Parasites, like
Children, Idolize every trifle; which
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:53793:110"/>
over-weening Opinion as much hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
true enjoiment as the diminish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Humor and Discontent of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and ends in the same Insatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
wherein the other begins.
A Christian looking upon all his
Prosperity as the effect of Gods
Providence, enjoies it in another
manner then any worldly man. The
ancient <hi>Hebrews</hi> seem to have had
a most familiar knowledge of Gods
Providence. When <hi>Isaac</hi> asked the
supposititious <hi>Esau</hi> concerning his
Venison. <hi>How is it that thou hast
found it so quickly my Son?</hi> He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
<hi>Because the Lord thy God
brought it to me.</hi> Though he lied in
the thing, yet the Phrase discovers
what apprehensions they had of the
most common mercies, which also
<hi>Isaac</hi> elegantly expresseth, speaking
of the pleasant sent of his Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<hi>See! the smell of my Son, is
as the smell of a field which the Lord
hath blessed.</hi> When we thus look
upon God as <hi>the Father of Lights,</hi>
                  <pb n="210" facs="tcp:53793:111"/>
the author and giver of every good
and perfect Gift, we see him as
easily begetting and multiplying
Mercies as the Sun doth Beams;
This takes away all Anxiety and
Fear of loss or want, which doth
more diminish the Comfort of
them then that Care and Labor
which they cost in purchasing. Again,
as Gods chief intention in bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Gifts, is to allure and bring
us home to himself, so a Christian
accepts them upon the same tearms,
as the Pledges of his love and Favor.
A Penny, which is the Earnest of
some great Bargain is another man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of thing then an ordinary Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
being given and received under
another notion: and this is the right
way to improve and sublimate Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity
to the hight more then any
Ambitious Humor or vain Sensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality
can do; <hi>eating and drinking
with a merry hart, for God accepteth
our works,</hi> and so we may well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
his Gifts. But though outward
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:53793:111"/>
Prosperity be a Jewell in the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sury
of Gods Mercy, yet it is not
the White Stone of his Justice. The
very Heathen, who were most af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
with sensible Divinity, knew
how to distinguish between the
Cause and the Success. They who
insist on this argument commonly
want a better, and will not stand
to it themselvs when they are
worsted. Decision by the Sword,
even in a lawfull War is like wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
Batail in a VVrit of Right, which
the purer light of Christianity hath
antiquated, as very uncertain and
unwarrantable. Success is the
Blessing of God upon a Good
Cause, and his Curse upon a Bad. It
is at most but a concurrent wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
which signifies nothing of it
self, the Justice of the thing is its
own best proof. God hath not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
that his Church and People
shall not suffer; but that though
they suffer they shall not perish, like
the bush which burned but was not
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:53793:112"/>
consumed: and that in the day
wherein he hath appointed to judge
the world they shall prevail and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph
for ever over all Injustice and
Oppression. But to improve Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
to the use of all advantages,
which it puts into our hands, though
otherwise irregular and unlawfull,
and to justify it by Gods Providence
giving us such an opportunity, is as
if a man should plead that he may
do any evill which is in his power,
and justify it by this, that God hath
given him the power and opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of doing it; and so make Gods
Providence patronize his Lusts, and
<hi>turn his Grace into wantonness.</hi>
Though Adversity be a necessary
preparation for Heaven, by reason
of our corruption, which is best
mortified by it, yet Prosperity in
it self is as fair and ready a way, and
the beginning thereof to the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
He is certainly a most Happy
man who can so enjoy it, as to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
as much by it as by Adversity.
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:53793:112"/>
Judgements drive, but <hi>Mercy leads
to repentance.</hi> This is an excellent
temper of Spirit, most pleasing to
God, and comfortable to our selvs,
but very rarely to be found in

               <p>THere is such a various mixture
of Prosperity and Adversity
in the Life of man, that he who
knows not how to enjoy both, can
never live happily in either.

Many mens spirits are like tender
and delicate Bodies, which have a
Most quick and exact sense of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
but a litle Pain kills them: like
Flies, very brisk and busy in the
Summer of Prosperity, but when
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:53793:113"/>
the Winter of Adversity overtakes
them, dead in the nest. <hi>Man is born
to misery,</hi> and Christians have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
a double Portion of it, and
of all Christians the best and strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
are usually exercised with the
greatest Afflictions, or made such
thereby. If therefore there were no
Enjoiment nor Fruit of suffering,
they should then be indeed of all
men most miserable: but as it is
Gods usuall way of dealing with his
Children, so his Promises and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedictions
run generally that way.
Though Affliction hath no naturall
Good in it self, yet it produceth
much Morall Good; yea it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth
the naturall Good, and
correcteth the Morall evill which is
in Prosperity: for Prosperity is as
Diet, but Adversity as Physike, which
recovereth from Surfets, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth
to a right tast. Though
Prosperity be more honorable in it
self, yet the Virtues of Adversity
are more honorable then of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity.

And those reall Conquerors are
most famous who have encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
the greatest Adversaries. Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity
overcome is the highest
Glory, and well undergone the
greatest Virtue. The Poets feign
of <hi>Hercules,</hi> not only that he slew
Tyrants and Monsters, but also that
he bore the whole weight of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
on his shoulders; shewing
thereby, that Virtue is as well exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised
in Bearing as in Acting.
Have you not heard, saith <hi>Iames,</hi>
of the Patience of <hi>Iob,</hi> as of
a most famous and memorable
thing: and it is indeed very admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to contemplate him assaulted
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:53793:114"/>
by Satan, and overcoming only by
enduring. Satan had challenged
<hi>Iob</hi> before God, that he would
make him curse him to his face: and
God permits him to try him, and
torture him to the utmost, only
sparing his Life, which was no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
but a lengthening of his
fuffering: yet <hi>Iob</hi> armed with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but Patience, like a Rock in
the midst of the waves, repells all
his assaults: standing so firm, that
he cannot force him to a complaint,
which is the most naturall Infirmity
of men in such a condition; nor
extort one foolish word from him.
<hi>In all this Iob sinned not, nor charged
God foolishly:</hi> yea, instead of Cursing
he falls to Blessing. <hi>The Lord hath
given, and the Lord hath taken away,
and blessed be the Name of the Lord:</hi>
which was a far greater torment to
Satan then all his could be to <hi>Iob.
Iulius Caesar</hi> when he had almost
lost the field at <hi>Munda,</hi> was ready
to have kill'd himself: so great a
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:53793:114"/>
Conqueror knew not how to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer
Adversity: and yet no man is
totally vanquished by it, till he
yield to it.
<q>Quicquid erit superanda omnis
Fortuna ferendo est.</q>
Though we loose all, we may still
<hi>possess our souls in Patience.</hi> This is
our last Reserv, and that strong
Hold whereunto he who is beaten
out of the Field may alwaies retire,
and cannot be forced out of it but
by surrendring it. The common
sort of men in Adversity are like
Children when they are whipt; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
wholly surprised with Grief
and Horror, never striving to keep
it from the Hart, but give up all
presently; betraying themselvs by
an utter despondency of Spirit, and
neglect of all Remedies or Cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls;
and so ly whining under the
power of their Adversary, bemoan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and pittying themselvs to no
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:53793:115"/>
purpose: which is a most evident
Sign of an absolute conquest, and
sinks the Soul wholly under water;
whereas Patience keeps up the
Head: yea many conspire with
their miseries, and are, as <hi>Quinti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>
expresseth it, <hi>Ambitiosi in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,</hi>
augmenting and aggravating
them as much as they can; as though
they found some Pleasure in Griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and some Musike in their mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Ditties: Or else Sturdily and
Sullenly bear their Afflictions with
a setled obstinacy of Mind, like
strong Bodies, on whom no Physike
can work when they most need it,
and so their Disease proves incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.
This is to out-brave God and
Nature, and rather to fly and shun
the sense of Affliction, then to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer
it. Men of Pleasure seek to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
it by inordinate and unseason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Mirth, Gaming, Drinking, and
Surfetting on the remainders of the
Feast of Prosperity, which is to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse
both: Politicians strive by all
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:53793:115"/>
means to make an Escape and get
out of Adversity, turning and wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
every way, like an Eel, as long
as there is any Life; but care not
to profit by it, or perhaps grow
wiser, but not better. Philosophers
fortify against it by the strength of
naturall Reason: as he said con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the death of his Son, <hi>Scio me
genuisse mortalem;</hi> accounting it a
gallant thing to be no more affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the death of a Man then the
breaking of a Pitcher. Only a
Christian <hi>Fruitur malis,</hi> which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
a most admirable Enjoiment.
Angels excell in strength, Doing the
will of God, but Christians in Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering:
and a patient enduring of
necessary evills, is next to a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
Martyrdome. A Christian
<hi>heareth the Rod and who hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed</hi>
it, which teaches him to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
and sweetens his suffering more
then all the Arts and shifts of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
men whereby they fence against
it. He hath a most acute sense of the
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:53793:116"/>
Pain, as feeling the anger of a God
in it, and yet bears it patiently as
the hand of his Father, who chasten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
every Son whom he loveth,
punishing for Sin, that so he may
punish from Sin: and so enjoieth the
Love of God and more comfort in
all his Evills, then worldly men do
in all their Good things.</p>

Of Death.</head>
               <p>DEath in it self, as it is a ces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
of Life, is an indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
or midle thing between Good
and Evill, and paralell with not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Born. In the Ages which have
preceded we did not live, and in the
succeeding we shall not live; the first
is a negative Death, the second a
privative. Therefore we may as
reasonably griev that we were born
no sooner, as that we shall live no
longer. Our very Life is a continuall
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:53793:116"/>
Death: for that which is past is
dead already: <hi>Quicquid retro est
mors habet,</hi> and when Death at
last shall shut up all and put a full
period to the Whole, it shall do no
more then what every moment doth
to the severall Parts. The last Sand
in the Glass runs out in the same
manner as the first. Therefore Death
should not seem so strange and
monstrous being thus familiarly
conversant with us every moment.
The difference between this Mortall
Life and Immortality is like that
between a Lease for years and an
Estate in Fee Simple: both go hand
in hand together, and equally
spend the same minutes of Time;
but the one still runs on, whereas
the other stops in a certain period.
Immortality looseth nothing by
spending, being renewed as fast as
it decaieth, and continueth still the
same Term; which the other doth
not, but is diminished by every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Fools flatter themselvs, and
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:53793:117"/>
suppose a kind of Immortality in
the present Instant of Life; because
it sufficeth for the present, aswell as
Immortality it self: and they hope
still to continue one year or day, or
moment longer. Thus the momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tany
and uncertain condition of
Life, which should most mortify, is
by vain men abused to the contrary.
Consider Death in relation to the
Evill things of this Life, and so it is a
Release from them all, and no part
of them: Diseases, Pains, Griefs,
and all those sad grones and ougly
faces which are put upon Death be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to Life which many times ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciseth
more cruelty and tyranny
then Death. Racking is a greater
pain then Beheading, yet not so
deadly. Assoon as Death enters
upon the Stage the Tragedy is done.
In relation to the Good things of
Life it is a totall deprivation of
them, and the Grave of all our
worldly affairs aswel as of our selvs;
yea as to our share and interest
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:53793:117"/>
therein, a dissolution of all this
World. The Tyrants wish, That the
whole Earth might perish with him,
took effect in himself: Death
laugheth at all the Actions of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
men, and stepping in when he
pleaseth, dasheth all in peices. Death
stops the mighty Conqueror in the
full Career of his Victories, and bids
him quit the field. Death deposeth
all Kings, and reduceth them to the
common equality of their originals.
Death sweeps down the great Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tician,
and the curious Cobweb of
his high Designs. Death silences the
learned Clerk, and makes the Poet
cease in the midst of his work, like
the Poeticall Swan,
<q>
                     <l>— Qui fixus arundine carmen</l>

               <p>The arguments which the World
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:53793:119"/>
commonly draws from Death are
very strange. Epicures say, Let us
eat and drink for to morrow we
shall dy. Certainly Death is the
worst Master of Revells. The Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
will live Poor, that he may dy
Rich: whereas indeed none dy
Rich, but the richest depart as poor
and naked out of this world as any,
leaving all their welth to others.
Glorious men dy daringly, that so
they may be famous after Death:
yet all their Fame is but as a stately
Monument set over their Graves.
Miserable men invoke Death and
fly to it as their only Remedy:
but they are the worst Physicians
who cure by killing. These and the
like are false enjoiments of Death,
and to no good end. The reference
it hath to another World, as it is a
parting Line between Life and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
doth best instruct us rightly
to enjoy it. <hi>Whatsoever thy hand
findeth to do,</hi> saith the Wiseman, <hi>do
it with thy might, for there is no work,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:53793:119"/>
nor device, nor knowledge, nor wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
in the Grave whither thou goest.</hi>
He makes Death an incitement to
Work, not an invitation to Play:
and the chief VVork and Business
of our Life is to gain eternall Life.
<hi>Blessed are the dead who dy in the
Lord, that they may rest from their
labors, and their works do follow them.</hi>
All other Works, all Arts and Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
and the vast Projects and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Enterprises which fill the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
of the World, end in the
Grave, <hi>In that very day his thoughts
perish:</hi> those only are our Stock
and Provision for another VVorld.
Thus a Christian enjoies Death by
being familiarly acquainted with
him, and taking him by the hand,
goes along with him in all his steps
and motions, dying dayly to the
World, and living to God and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:
and when Death at last sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
him to depart, he willingly
resigns up all as things which no
longer concern him. He looks upon
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:53793:120"/>
Heaven as a Kingdom in Reversion
after his own Life, and looses no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in the mean time by staying
for it: while he lives he encreases
his future Glory, and when he dies
he goes to possess it. Men of this
world, whose hope is only in this
Life, put Death far from them,
though it be most naturall and
nigh unto them, and the most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of all future things: and when
Death appears and stares them in
the face, they behold him as a most
strange and horrid thing; either dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
away through fear and astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as <hi>Nabal</hi> did; or enraged,
like a wild Bull in a net, as the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
<hi>Duke of Biron;</hi> or with <hi>Iudas</hi>
desperately plunge themselvs into
Hell; like <hi>Empedocles,</hi> who cast him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self

               <p>SIn is the Death of Souls, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of Perdition, which like the
<hi>Cici</hi> or Worm in <hi>Ionas</hi> Gourd, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
the world almost assoon as

is almost as wonderfull as the
Mystery of Grace and Godliness;
that it should be so exceeding sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
and that being such it could
possibly enter into the VVorld,
when it was so perfectly constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that there was no cleft or cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
in it, by which Sin might creep
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:53793:121"/>
forth &amp; enter into it, untill it made
way for it self. Before <hi>Adam</hi> by
fatall experience acquired the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of Good and Evill, Sin might
seem an incredible thing: for how
could it be imagined that a reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
Creature, of perfect under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
and exact integrity, made
only to serv and obey his Creator,
and conscious that all his Happiness
consisted therein, should rebell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him, and at once plunge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
and all his Posterity into ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
Misery? As there was no
reason for Sin, so neither was there
any root or ground out of which
it should spring, only a bare Possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of doing that which was most
unreasonable and unnaturall. <hi>God
made Man upright, but they have
sought out many inventions,</hi> he was
fain to seek out and invent the way
of undoing himself, and to create
Sin, which God had not made. But
that which is most wonderfull in
Sin, and which hath puzled the most
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:53793:121"/>
profound Doctors, is the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Gods Permission and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;
how and why he should
suffer such an Enemy to himself and
all his Creatures, to invade the
World and ruin the whole Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
It is certainly the greatest
quarrell and highest blasphemy
which the Divells and damned have
against God, that he should make
them to damn them, and it is the
strongest argument in the corrupt
minds of the sinners of this VVorld
who have not yet felt the Hell of
Sin, that it is no such great matter
as Divines would perswade them:
thinking, that because God doth
permit it, therefore he will also to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerate
it. This is the strange and
prodigious birth of Sin, and the
Nature of it is answerable thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to:
for it is no less then the doing of
that w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> we ought not to do, or the
not doing of that which we ought
to do, and what we ought not to do
is in the very next degree to what
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:53793:122"/>
we cannot do. Chast <hi>Ioseph</hi> puts the
one for the other. <hi>How can I do
this wickedness and sin against God?</hi>
making morall Entity and Bonity
as convertible as Naturall, and
Gods Interdiction as restraining as
his Interposition. This Monster
assoon as it is born is so strong and
adult in mischief, that it destroieth
the Womb that bare it, and infect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the whole Sphere of its activi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
though acts of Sin make it
grow, yet the first birth thereof
makes it a complete Body, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
an universall and eternall
punishment. It hath blasted the
whole inferior world and laid the
foundations of Hell it self: hence
are all the Evills in Nature, all the
disorders in Humane society, and
villanies of Men. The Story of the
<hi>Italian,</hi> who first made his Enemy
deny God, and then Stab'd him, and
so at once murdered both Body and
Soul, declares the perfect malignity
thereof: and should the dire im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precations
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:53793:122"/>
of revengefull Spirits be
alwaies executed on others, we
should create Divells and Hells e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to destroy all Mankind. But
all this is the least and lowest Evill
in it; the perfection thereof con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
in the contrariety and enmity
against God. It is called a Law of
Sin, as being directly opposite to
the Law of God: for what God
saith, <hi>Thou shalt do,</hi> Sin saith, <hi>Thou
shalt not do,</hi> and what he saith, <hi>Thou
shalt not do,</hi> Sin saith, <hi>Thou shalt do;</hi>
and so inverts the whole Decalogue,
and the very Law of Nature, rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
God of his Creature, and setting
it up against him, and in his throne.
No created Majesty can endure
a Consort, much less Divine,
which is most absolutely and
infinitely Supreme. It is true, Sin can
never effect what it intends, and
therefore wicked men think it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
because it cannot hurt and
wrong God: but a declared intent
is Treason, even among men, much
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:53793:123"/>
more by the Law of God, who is
chieifly served or disserved by our
Spirits and Wills: yea this shows
the most perfect malice of Sin, that
it fights against a Majesty which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be wronged; and breeds a
more haughty disdain and just re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
in him whom it opposeth, to
be defied by so base and Enemy. Men
may say, they do not intend to
hurt God; yet they do trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress
and offend his Law, which is
to offend himself, though the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
may be to do God good ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.
If therefore there be any such
difference in Nature, as Good and
Evill; if there be any Monster or
Mischief in the World, Sin is really
the worst of Evills, being most
contrary to the Chief Good: and
in this relation it is infinitely evill,
though as it is a finite act it cannot
be really and properly infinite, for
then it should be an Enemy equall
to God: but it comes as neer to
infinite as possibly it can: and if the
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:53793:123"/>
Soul were infinite it would Sin infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely,
as being eternall it will sin
eternally: yea it is as it were infinite
to us, for we cannot measure nor
comprehend the utmost extent of
the sinfulness thereof, no more then
we can number the particular acts.
Let us therefore stand amazed at the
sight of this <hi>Hydra,</hi> this killing and
never dying Serpent, devouring all
Good, and propagating all Evill.
Now what enjoiment can there
be of such a perfect Evill. Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
next to the Grace of God a
Christian reaps the greatest Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
from it; yea Grace it self, which
delivereth from Sin, cannot be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joied
without the enjoiment of Sin
from which it delivereth: and the
more horrid and hellish Sin is, the
more doth the Love of God appear
in delivering us from it, and in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
the little spark of his Grace
in the midst of an Ocean of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
There is no such Antipathy
in Nature, as between Holiness and
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:53793:124"/>
Unholiness, the contrariety of Vice
and Virtue is far short of it: Grace
is the highest perfection of the Soul,
and Sin the greatest imperfection.
As sin is the occasion of our greatest
Good and highest Preferment, so it
is also of Gods greatest Glory, and
therein we should rejoice. <hi>There is
more Ioy in Heaven over one Sinner
that repenteth, then over ninety and
nine Iust persons who need no repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</hi>
Thus the more we hate it, the
more we enjoy it, and our greatest
abhorrency doth most excite this
affection of holy Joy: and this is
the high priviledge of a Christian,
to enjoy that which is most contrary
unto him, not only by forbearing
it, but also by Gods forgiving and
recovering out of it to a state of
higher Perfection and Happiness.</p>

of the Restauration of the Soul.</head>
               <p>THe Restauration of the Soul is
the Conversion of it from Sin
to God, as the Corruption thereof
was a defection from God to Sin.
This is a greater and more glorious
work then the first Creation, and
the utmost Design of God in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the VVorld. As in an inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
Poem, which is the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Fancy, the chief excellency is
the Plot, and the excellency of
the Plot is the strange difficulty
and intricacy of the <hi>Epitasis,</hi> or
troublesome state of the Business,
which is afterward beyond all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
cleared up, and resolved
into an happy <hi>Catastrophe:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
if it should be carried on in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
course of Prosperity, it would
seem very flat and dull without art
or wit. Thus God having made all
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:53793:125"/>
things for himself, and the manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station
of of his own Glory, as the
wisest end which he could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
to himself, was not satisfied
with the first work of Creation,
though exceeding good and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
in its kind: but assoon as it was
finished, suffered Sin to enter upon
the Stage, bringing Death and Hell
along with it, and so to confound
and destroy all. This was the <hi>Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus
vindice nodus,</hi> such as all the
Wit of Men and Angels could not
unty, till God himself came down
from Heaven, and resolved it into
this more glorious work of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption;
which is an uncreating
of Sin, and a creating of Grace:
God cannot make <hi>Factum infectum,</hi>
but by pardoning Sin he makes it
<hi>Quasi infectum:</hi> Sin remitted is as
though it had never been co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted.
Thus Justice it self justifies the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just,
and being overcome it tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs.
Justice and Mercy could
not meet together in any other
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:53793:125"/>
way, and there is no other Instance
in the whole History of the VVorld
of any act of God which doth so
perfectly exercise all his Attributes,
&amp; manifest all his Glory, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
fulfill the end of Creation.
As God justifies the Ungodly, so he
makes him Godly, which is the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
part of this great work, and no
less wonderfull then the former.
If the entrance of Sin into the
VVorld be so stupendious, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsion
thereof is much more. The
Peripatetikes suppose the Soul of
Man to be like a plain Table, or as
we say, a blank Paper, on which
Good or Evill may be imprinted,
and so equally indifferent to both.
But other Heathens have confessed
the contrary, <hi>Nam vitiis nemo sine
nascitur</hi>—and all Christianity is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it. If their Opinion were true,
probably some one man among so
many millions might have lived
pure from Sin, perhaps through the
whole course of his life, or for a
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:53793:126"/>
year, or day, or hour; or at least
might perform some one action per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
good, which none ever did.
Therefore the Platonikes, say the
Soul is like a Chariot drawn with
two Horses, whereof one is fair and
generous, the other deformed and
resty. The first is the Rationall part,
the second the Sensuall: some Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonicall
Divines call them Flesh
and Spirit; but it is most evident
that not only the inferior faculties,
but also the superior are corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
otherwise the inferior could
not draw them away; they being
able of themselvs to put forth their
own acts pure and incorrupt; the
Mind is free and cannot sin but
from it self, though it may be tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and urged by others. On the
contrary, sometimes the Mind urges
the inferior faculties to sin beyond
the common bounds of their nature,
and the utmost desires of Beasts:
besides, there are many rationall
and spirituall Sins wherein the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:53793:126"/>
Faculties have no share. The
Pelagians seem to grant a mixture
of both principles of Good and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
in every Faculty, and that by
our own endeavors the Good Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
may be so exercised and exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that it may prevail against the
other: but then why might it not
proceed so far, as wholly to extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
the other? for by prevailing
in part, it gains some farther degree
of strength, and the other looseth
as much; and a greater strength of
Good may more probably prevail
against a lesser strength of Evill,
then a lesser strength of Good
could against a greater strength of
Evill; or if the Good can never
overcome the evill, then every act
flowing from both, will be mixt
and imperfect, and can merit no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but the just indignation of a
pure and perfect God, and so leav
us in the same state of misery in
which it found us. The Semipelagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
therefore, who have spun out
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:53793:127"/>
this thread to the utmost fineness
which it will bear without break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
say, there is indeed left in Man
a free will to Good, but such as
cannot act the Good it would with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a Divine assistance; yet the
Will of Man freely inclining it self
to Good, inclines God to assist him
with his Grace: and that God e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally
foreseeing this Good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination,
did therefore, and not
otherwise, pre-ordain such to Grace
and Salvation; So that God doth
not turn the Will, which they say is
contrary to the freedom thereof,
but concur with it in promoting it.
Thus they think they have fairly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided
this great Controversy, by
parting the stakes between Gods
Grace and Mans Will: but <hi>they
erre, not knowing the Scriptures, nor
the power of God,</hi> subordinating the
will of God to the will of Man, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then the will of Man to the
will of God, and make this greatest
work of Redemption lesser then
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:53793:127"/>
that the Creation, which proceeded
from nothing. Though it may be a
problematicall Question in Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
whether one sin doth naturally
of it self destroy all Grace, yet it is
most true, that the eating of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
fruit was such a Criticall and
Fatall sin which did incurr the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of Death, by which this Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
Death of Grace is chiefly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
and so judicially produced
the same effect; for as one sin may
be punished with another, so may
it be punished with all Sin, by virtue
of such a precedent Compact: and
thus is that Originall Sin imputed
and derived unto us, not only by
naturall propagation: for then all
other sins of Parents should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend
upon their Children in the
same manner: but as that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
was a triall of Mans universall
obedience, so the breach thereof
was an universall sin, and the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
equall unto it. Yet the will of
Man remains free in its own nature,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:53793:128"/>
else it should not freely sin, and so
not sin at all; nor doth necessity
take away freedom; for God doth
most necessarily, and yet most free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
will his own Glory; and the
will of man doth necessarily and
freely will Good, reall or appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent:
yea in the very act of willing
it is necessarily determined to one
particular object, and yet doth then
will most freely, that is, not as
Beasts, through Appetite and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct,
but with a Rationall Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
The will of man is free accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Law of Nature, and by
that very Law it is impossible that
it should be so free as not to be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate
to God, and manageable
by his supernaturall and infinite
power, in such a supernaturall and
infinite manner as doth not destroy
the will it self, not the freedom of
it, which is of the nature thereof:
for if God should not govern the
will of Men and Angels, as well as
all other things, he should not rule
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:53793:128"/>
and order the highest acts of his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blest
Creatures; nor can there be
any Pre-vision in God, without this
Pre-ordination. Providence in the
Word signifieth Foreseeing, but in
the Thing Fore-ordaining, because
God by foreseeing doth fore-or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain;
and so that distinction where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
they so much depend falls to the
ground, which <hi>Tully</hi> ingenuously
confesseth, and therefore denying
Fate, denyeth also Oracles and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Prescience; and <hi>Bradwardine</hi>
disputeth it affirmatively thus; He
who made this World, and all things
therein did certainly foresee what
he made, and it being eternally
true, that whatsoever hath been, is,
or shall be in the World, should be
before it was, God who is omnisci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
must certainly foreknow it;
now this certain foreknowledge in
God could not be grounded on the
things themselvs which should be,
for the World had yet no being,
but was a meer Nothing; and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:53793:129"/>
could not be the Cause nor
Object of Gods foreknowledge of
things which should be, but God
himself, or as the Platonikes and
Schoolmen speak, the <hi>Idea</hi> in the
Mind of God, which is in himself,
and of himself; and according to
which the thing was produced, in
that manner as he had ordained;
otherwise the foresight of God
could not be infallible, nor any
foresight at all; and therefore on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
God can certainly foreknow, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he only can certainly pre-or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain;
and there can be no exempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Will of Man more then
of the actions of any other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
The vast consequences there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
and that grand objection con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
sin, <hi>Why doth he yet finde
fault, for who hath resisted his Will?</hi>
are resolved by the great Apostle
so fully, that if all the Cavils of men
against this Truth were now pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
unto him, he could not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
them more directly then he
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:53793:129"/>
doth; nor is it possible for any mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
man to satisfie him whom the
Spirit of God Speaking so expresly
in that place doth not satisfie. As
one saith, At the day of Judgement
we shall fully understand his 9. Chap.
to the <hi>Romans:</hi> This being the
great and generall Case between
God and Sinners, is reserved for
that great and generall Assises;
<hi>That God may be justified in his say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and might overcome when he is
judged.</hi> And the more proud men
do now exalt themselvs against this
Truth, the more should a Christian
admire and enjoy the wounderfull
work of his Conversion, which as it
is supernaturall, so it is incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensible,
and say of his new Birth, as
<hi>David</hi> said of his naturall Birth,
<hi>Fearfully and wonderfully am I made.</hi>

Spirituall Regeneration and the

Being of it self is morally nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Good nor Evill, out capable or
either. Thus Grace, though Acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall,
is more valuable then the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of the Soul. Grace is that
which the Scripture calleth <hi>A Good
and Honest Hart,</hi> that is, Ingenuity
or Goodness toward God; As the
word <hi>Piety</hi> generally signifieth a
good disposition toward all Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
So the Poet calleth his <hi>Aeneas
Pious,</hi> as well for his officious duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
toward his Father <hi>Anchises,</hi>
as for his religious devotion toward
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:53793:130"/>
his goods. The contrary hereof is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a direct malignity, or Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criticall
and double dealing with
God. This Ingenuity consists in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
Discretion, or <hi>Ingenium,</hi> and
a towardly Disposition, or <hi>Indoles</hi>
of the Soul. Discretion, or a right
discerning between things that dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
is the genuine sense of divine
Goodness, and the sinfulness of Sin;
whereby the Mind clearly beholds
the Beauty of the one, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
of the other, and is so sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
and filled with this Light, that
there is no reserv of any contrary
opinion, or secret subtilty of a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
wit, lurking in any corner,
which may prevail against it, and
seduce the Soul from God. Good
Disposition is the bias or inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Soul toward God, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
from Sin, a rising from an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Sympathy with the one, and
Antipathy against the other. These
two beget a Christian Nobility and
Gallantry of Spirit<hi>—in coctum
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:53793:131"/>
generoso pectus honesto.</hi> The Mind
thus setled and fortified within it
self, is able to encounter all the
proud Fansies and vain Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of men, whereby they exalt
themselvs against Heaven; to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise
the greatest prosperity of the
most glorious Sinners, to nauseate
the Circean Cup of their sweetest
pleasures, and scorn the witty impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties
of a <hi>Lucian,</hi> or a <hi>Iulian,</hi> and
the whole Stage of profane Scof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers;

of persecution. Hence proceeds an
inward Joy and sweet Delight in
God and all Goodness, as naturally
pleasing to the new Nature of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified

Conqueror that ever was in the
world, was eminently acted by this
Spirit, being the most profound and
powerfull Preacher of the Gospell
of Grace, and the highest Example
thereof in himself. And though this
spirit of Grace were not perfect in
them, much less in common Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
yet it is that true <hi>Genius</hi> thereof
in all, striving and prevailing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the evill spirit of Corruption
in them; and being the very Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteristicall
note of true Conversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and that which Divines call
<hi>Sincerity.</hi> Of all particular Graces,
the first and fundamentall is Faith
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:53793:132"/>
in Christ, because this unites the
Soul to him who is the Fountain of
this new Life, sucking from him a
Divine influence, and deriving it to
all other Graces, and so mingling it
self with them, resigns all back again
to Christ, not as works or merits,
but as his Gifts and Graces, by him
to be presented to God. This Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall
Faith doth more perfectly
unite the Soul to Christ and God
by him, then all the inherent Grace
of <hi>Adam;</hi> and this union of Faith
is perfected in a more high and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
Love, which also flows from
it; for as we are now more behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to God, so we are more obliged
to love him, and God also loves
most where he gives most. This
Love begets Obedience, Love being
the most serviceable and active Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of the Soul, and not only
binds us to the Command, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gages
us of it self to become like to
him whom we do love: nor can
there be any mutuall delight be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:53793:132"/>
God and the Soul without
likeness. <hi>Can two walk together ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
they be agreed?</hi> Glory being
Grace perfected, where there is no
Grace, there can be no Glory. As
Christ, though he suffered for sin, yet
would not endure the least stain
thereof in himself, so though a
Christian by his suffering is freed
from the curse of Sin, yet is he no
less an enemy to all Sin. And as the
Grace of God doth not restrain
him from commanding, by which
he worketh Grace in us, so neither
should it hinder us from using the
means by which it is conveied to
us. This obedience of a Christian,
though very weak and imperfect
in it self, yet being performed
in the Strength of Christ, is more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
to God then all the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
obedience of <hi>Adam.</hi> There is
no condition which hath not a
Grace fit for it, whereby it may be
sweetned and sanctified, which is
the happy Enjoiment thereof, a
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:53793:133"/>
Heaven within, though there be a
Hell without. <hi>In the world,</hi> saith

Graces, or the Souls <hi>Gymna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sium,</hi>
the ordinary way wherein
God hath appointed to meet us and
converse with us, and so instead of
all those extraordinary manifestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of his presence in former times.
As in our Naturall and Civill life he
hath ordained severall Callings and
Emploiments for the well spending
of our time, and advancing our tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
Estates, so also in the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
life he hath instituted certain
Ordinances and Duties for the act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and improving of our Graces.
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:53793:133"/>
They who live without a Calling
and some constant Business, wander
up and down in the Wilderness of
Vanity and Vice, &amp; such as despise
or neglect Duties, prove as extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
and licentious in Religion.
There is a double Error concerning
them. Some are very strict and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous
in Duties, but rest in the
work done, and count them by their
Beads, or measure them by their
Hourglass, rather then weigh them
in the Balance of the Sanctuary; not
regarding how and with what Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
they perform them: whereas
the very Heathens esteemed it no
Litation, if there were any notable
defect in the Intralls; but sacrificed
again, taking that for none, yea
worse then none, as being omnious
and unlucky. Others speak so much
of the Spirit and inward part of the
Duty, that they wholly neglect the
Body thereof: but there is a great
difference between a Body and a
Carcase. Outward worship with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:53793:134"/>
Spirit and Truth is a dead Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>case,
but with it is a living Body.
They pretend to the Spirit, and wait
for the impulses and motions there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
but neglect the waies aud means
which the Spirit hath prescribed in
his Word, and if we strictly observ
them, we shall find such generally to
be as formally Spirituall; as others
are formall in Duties; full of words
and notions, and placing all religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in them God hath purposely or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
solemn and set Duties to
restrain our wandring Spirits, and
bind them to his service, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
through the manifold di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versions
of worldly occasions, or
this vain pretension of waiting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Spirit, we should wholly
neglect. <hi>David</hi> was a most holy
and spirituall man, and his <hi>Psalms</hi>
as full of spirituall life and vigor as
any part of the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> yet
we may observ in them; how com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
he begins heavily and with
much diffidence, &amp; so quickning by
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:53793:134"/>
degrees, concludes with much as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance
of Faith and Spirituall Joy.
Therefore Duties are not to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred,
because we are dull and
indisposed, but so much rather to be
practiced; that thereby we may
gather heat and life: and we have
no warrant otherwise to expect the
Spirit of God then in his own way.
Our Spirits are like Instruments of
Musike which must be often tuned,
or like Watches which must be
wound up daily. The morning and
evening sacrifices under the Law
seem to typify to us under the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
the spirituall offering up of
Christ at the beginning and end of
the day. Duties are the Diet of the
Soul, and it is best to make constant
and set meals of them; though as
our naturall food, they may be ite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
or deferred upon speciall oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions:
but to omit them for any
long time is dangerous, and wholly
to neglect them, deadly. Christian
Duties, whereof we now speak,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:53793:135"/>
are either such as God hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
in the way of naturall wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
which we ow unto him; as to
pray, preach, meditate, confer, and
the like, and in these there is nothing
ceremoniall or servile, more then in
the Worship it self which is exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised
by them: or such as are speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
and extraordinarily instituted
by God; as the Sacraments: and
being such, may not be rejected, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
we should plainly resist God: or
else such as are mixt of both, and so
partake of the nature and reason of
both, as morall Duties circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated
by Divine Institution. As for
those proud and foolish Spirits,
who say they are above Ordinances
and Duties, they may aswell say
they are above all Religion and
God himself. The right enjoiment
of Duties is first to attend them as
our main business, without which
we do not use them, much less injoy
them. <hi>Mary</hi> was as much busied in
hearing Christ, as <hi>Martha</hi> was about
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:53793:135"/>
his entertainment. The Heathen
Priests began with, <hi>Hoc age:</hi> they
thought it a very irreligious thing to
be remiss and vain, though in a vain
Religion. When a Coal fell upon the
hand of him who held the Censer,
while <hi>Alexander</hi> was sacrificing, he
rather suffered it to be burnt, then stir
it. To Attention we must join Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Spirit: as we must love God,
so also we must serv him, <hi>withall our
heart, withall our Soul, and with all
our might.</hi> Good intervenient
thoughts may be generally good,
but are very sinful in this particular
circumstance; Again we must mingle
every Duty as well as Hearing with
Faith, beginning, proceeding, and
ending all in Christ, who is the
great and universall Ordinance of
God. As our Spirit doth animate
the Duty on our part, so doth the
Spirit of God on his part. This com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of our Spirits with the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of God in the Duty, is the happy
enjoiment thereof, which renders it
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:53793:136"/>
as spirituall as immediate influxes of
the Spirit in any extraordinary way.
Hence proceeds Joy and Delight:
men of action naturally delight in
Business, chiefly such as they find
profitable to them. As profit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets
delight, so delight begets pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit.
<hi>Be not slothfull in Business, fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
in Spirit, serving the Lord.</hi> God
doth not impose Duties upon us as
tasks and burdens, as a Master exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciseth
his Servant; but as a Teacher
his Scholar, for his instruction and
education. They are the Paedagogy
of Heaven, preparing us for it: this
apprehension of them takes off all
the drudgery and servility from
them, and renders them our reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
and willing service, most profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to our selvs, and acceptable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God.</p>

Of Conscience.</head>
               <p>COnscience is the greatest obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
to Duty; the supreme
Dictator, and chief Magistrate in the
Soul, and not only as a Magistrate
externally imposing Laws and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
but rather as a <hi>Genius</hi> or
<hi>Daemon</hi> within us, speaking Oracles,
and exercising a Divine authority
over us; which must be exactly sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
in every point with a direct
and active obedience: and in this
respect it hath some kind of co-ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
power and authority with God
himself: for as Conscience without
Divine authority will not justify an
action, so God will not accept it
without the concurrent authority of
Conscience: there must be as it were
mutuall Indentures between both
parties: God first indites and seals
the deed, and Conscience must also
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:53793:137"/>
seal the Counterpart: without the
one our service is unlawfull, and
without the other unreasonable.
This double authority being requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
to every action, any contrariety
or diversity between them, puts the
Soul into a strange confusion: for
whether we do follow an erring
Conscience we sin, or whether we do
not we sin, and when the Conscience
doubts and hangs in suspense be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
two contrary opinions, not
knowing which way to take, like
<hi>Pentheus,</hi> who thought he saw
<q>Et solem geminum, &amp; geminus se
ostendere Thebas.</q>
it sins whether it goes one way or
other, or neither, if the case be such,
as the thing ought to be done, or not
done. This miserable condition in
which the Soul is thus intangled
proceeds from the naturall corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
thereof, which is a difformity
from the Mind of God, and that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:53793:137"/>
authority, as a right Judgment
is a conformity thereunto: yet men
secretly charge it upon God as a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
exactor of that which is beyond
their understanding, and think very
hardly of him, that they should be
involved in this Labyrinth of Error,
and put into such a necessity of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning;
though this proceed not from
any darkness of Truth, which is a
most pure and clear Light, but the
blindness which is in their Minds. To
avoid this, Naturalists and Socinians
suppose him a good easy and indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
God, content with any thing,
and well liking to be served with
their good meaning, subordinating
the authority of God to Conscience,
rather then the authority of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
to God: and so to deify their
corrupt Reason, debase &amp; dishonor
the Deity. Others who are not so
impudent as to expect a toleration
for their Consciences from God,
yet exact it from men. It is true, no
humane authority can force the
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:53793:138"/>
Conscience, which to imagine is as
ridiculous as that there should be
a Law made against thinking: but if
it may not restrain words and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which are things overt, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to the outward man, it is an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
of God to no purpose, for
where there is no Law, every man
may act according to his own
Conscience, and if he may do so
where there is a Law, the Law is
vain, and of no force or authority.
This is another difficulty of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
when the publike and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritative
Judgment, and the private
differ, but more easily resolved then
the former. If the thing be unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
it is better to obey God then
Man; yet God who hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
us to be active in such cases,
hath also commanded us to be pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
in suffering; which is the only
lawfull escape he hath reserved for
such as are under lawfull authority:
and which neither destroieth the
publike authority, nor our private
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:53793:138"/>
Conscience. But proud and furious
Spirits, impatient of suffering, and
despising this low and humble way
of passive obedience, whereof Christ
himself, &amp; all his Apostles have given
us both the precept and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
will rather confound all
Laws and Bonds of Humane Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
then be crost in their own wills.
A right Conscience will preserv it
self in a right way, and by right
means, both in doing and suffering,
otherwise Martyrdome it self should
be only Patience perforce, and the
hight of Christian Grace inferior
to Heathenish Virtue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> As Religion
is a chief Bond of Humane Society,
and indeed the very Spirit and Soul
thereof, which governeth the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
man; so the differences and
dissentions about it have alwaies
proved dangerous, and sometimes
fatall to the State: and therefore
may be no more to lerated then civil
Seditions: What confusion and
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:53793:139"/>
mischief did the Arrian Heresy
work in the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire: the
different expositions of the <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metan</hi>
Law serv to foment the wars
between the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Persians:</hi>
So doth the Popish and Protestant
Doctrine among Christians; and
the Lutheran and Calvinisticall, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minian
and Antiarminian among
Protestants. The most strange and
prodigious villanies which were
ever acted among men have been
commonly the effects of an erring
Conscience. Such was <hi>Agamemnons</hi>
sacrificing his Daughter, whereof
<hi>Lucretius</hi> doth so much complain;
<hi>Orestes</hi> his killing of his mother, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
perswaded to it, as <hi>Euripides</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateth,
by the oracle of <hi>Apollo.</hi> The
Vespers, Massacres, Powderplots of
false and furious Zelots, the most im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious
Paricides, Rebellions, and
Treasons of Anabaptisticall Spirits
have been the Dictates of their fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike
Consciences. An evill Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:53793:139"/>
is the greatest Tyrant; a mans
own evill Spirit, or the Divell with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
him, possessing and ingaging the
whole man, and disturbing the
world. Yet because of the Errors in
Conscience, and much mischief pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
from them, to abdicate
Conscience it self is a most desperate
and profane Humor, destroying all
sense of Good or Evill, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding
Heaven with Hell, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
a good and right Conscience is
like the Holy Spirit, our best Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector
and Comforter, As we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
serv God without it, so nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can we enjoy any actuall
Happiness in him without the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
thereof; <hi>his Spirit bearing
witness with our Spirit that we are
his Children.</hi> This is both the
<hi>Basis</hi> and <hi>Acme</hi> of the Soul, the
foundation and perfection of a
Christian life, being indeed the
most roiall and generous thing in
Man. <hi>Horace</hi> his description there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:53793:140"/>
is, as <hi>Calvin</hi> observeth, too
high for a Heathen; but true of a
<hi>David,</hi> and a right Christian.

Of the last Iudgement.</head>
               <p>Conscience is the supreme Judge
within a man, but very erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
in matter of Right, though
seldom erring in matter of Fact: nor
is it alwaies rectified by the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of others, whereof their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
are also Dictators: yea the
very Providence of God in this
world, which men look upon as his
Judgement at present, supposing him
alwaies to favor the Victorious, is
so various, &amp; many times so contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
that many times a <hi>Cato</hi> may justly
prefer the other side. But certainly
there is such a thing in nature as
Justice, though she have long since
left the earth; and <hi>the Iudge of all
the earth must do right,</hi> and doth
immediately pass sentence upon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
evill act assoon as it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:53793:141"/>
though it be not speedily
executed. The greater the present
confusion of all things is, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
is the certainty of the last Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
God never made a world to
no purpose, and Rationall Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
which are his chief Subjects,
only to rebell against him. The
Heathen were so perplexed with the
consideration hereof, having no
certain knowledge of this last
Judgement, that sometimes they
thought there was no God, <hi>Esse
deos credamne?</hi> — denying the
very Creed of Nature, and surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
the belief of a Deity to their
doubting of his Providence, it seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
more credible to them that
there is no God, then that he
should be unjust. Sometimes they
thought God did not regard these
inferior things, but only made a
sport and pastime of them.

                     <pb n="272" facs="tcp:53793:142"/>
Ludit in humanis divina potentia

Sometimes they thought one God
favored one side, and another the
other.

The Manichees went so far in this
Opinion as to set up an universall
and standing Paire of contrary
Gods, whereof one is the Author
of Good, and the other of Evill:
which is the naturall Idolatry of
many barbarous Nations. The My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries
of Providence have puzled
the whole world: and indeed it is so
strange an Administration, that there
seems to be left no more then what
is meerly necessary for the preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the world. Assoon as any
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:53793:142"/>
Family or State grows up to a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity,
they have their period, and
are thrown down again: and when
any man becomes strictly honest and
religious, he can hardly be suffered
to breath, nor enjoy a common be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
among men. <hi>Aristides</hi> the Just,
and <hi>Socrates</hi> who lived as he taught,
could not be endured in the most
learned City of the world. Even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
Christians the power and life
of that Religion which is generally
professed, is most opposed; whereas
they who have been most forward
in any false Religion have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
most honored. Certainly there
is another manner of account to be
taken of these things, or else we
must suppose God to be a most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discreet
<hi>Phaeton</hi> &amp; unwise Governor
of the World, which is very irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
and irrationall. God can no
more rest in this confusion of all
things, then he could in the first
<hi>Chaos;</hi> but will a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

the perfect module of his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:53793:143"/>
and Justice, and the cerrain
expectation thereof is that which
doth easily absolv him, and answer
all objections: for then shall this
Face of Providence which now to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
us seems monstrous and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
as it shall look toward
God, appear most beautifull, not
only in the principall lineaments
thereof, but in every hair of the
least circumstance: then shall every
thing attain that perfection for
which it was ordained and design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by him, and be set in its right
place and order, never to be remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
or disordered any more. The first
Creation was but an Embrion of
this other world of perfection,
which shall be then completed: and
so shall ensue that eternall Sabbath,
wherein God shall rest and reign
for ever. The chief materials of this
new World are Angels and Men,
the everlasting Monuments of his
Mercy and Justice, who are now in
a continuall progress toward the
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:53793:143"/>
most contrary terms of extreme
Happiness and Misery. Then shall
Truth and Error, Good and Evill,
be as cleerly distinguished and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
by all, as now the Eye doth
judge of Colors, Black and White,
Light and Darkness, and every one
receive according to his Deeds: so
that there shall not be one farthing
got or lost by all this forbearance.
Though Hell hath most of men, yet
Heaven had the first, who died a
Martyr: and God will have some
of both sorts in all Ages and Parts
of the World to fill both places.

Though he thought a <hi>Brutus</hi> or a
<hi>Cato</hi> could hardly be found in any

tells us that better then they <hi>shall
come from the East, and West, and sit
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:53793:144"/>
down with Abraham, Isaac, and
Iacob in the Kingdome of God:</hi> and
they in Heaven sing unto him. <hi>Thou
hast redeemed us unto God out of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Kindred, and Tong, and People,
and Nation;</hi> As when any man hath
filled up the measure of his Sin or
Grace he is taken out of this world;
so when the whole number of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
and Saints shall be accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
then shall the World it self cease
and be resolved into this perfect
Kingdome. Christ shall have his
mystical Body made of all his Saints,
as so many members of severall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions;
and the Divell shall have
his made up of sinners of all sorts
and Sizes; and God shall be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
glorified in both. God made
the first world in order, measure, and
weight, much more this second
world, which must be most perfect
and perpetuall. The perfection of
this perfection, and that wherein
God is most glorified, is the salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Man: therefore as the first
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:53793:144"/>
man that died was saved, so <hi>the dead
in Christ shall rise first:</hi> though there
shall be more of the damned, which
is also to set forth the singular and
extraordinary Grace of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the blessed, yet there is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
manifestation of Gods Glory in
them that are saved then in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Justice is equally ballanced by
rewarding the good, and punishing
the bad: but the saving of one Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
which is an act of free Grace
and Bounty, far exceeds both: and
damnation, which is but a due pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,
holds no proportion with
it. There is more merit in the blood
of Christ, by which we are saved,
then demerit in the Divells and all
the damned. A Christian enjoies this
day of Judgement by a constant and
joifull expectation thereof, which is
so terrible unto others: and as God
will then reduce all the confusions
of this world into a state of perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
so shall all the reproches and
sufferings of the Saints end in eternal
Glory and Blessedness.</p>

can hardly deny the last, unless we
also deny the first. God who is the
great Judge will not only pass sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
which is but an <hi>Idea</hi> of Justice,
but also execute it upon the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
which is the life and existence
thereof. Therefore every Religion
hath instituted some kind of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and Hell, places of reward and
punishment sutable to it self: and
the more pure and spirituall the
Religion is, the more exact are the
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:53793:145"/>
Heaven and Hell belonging to it:
for as it deals with God himself, so
it doth with his Justice and Mercy.
The Barbarous Nations suppose that
after Death they shall be transpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
beyond I know not what
Mountains, and there receiv some
childish rewards. The Poets have
their <hi>Elysium</hi> and <hi>Tartarus,</hi> and
have furnished them with severall
kinds of Pleasures and Pains. The
<hi>Turks</hi> fansy a Paradise of all car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
Delights, and a place of corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reall
Torments, very gross and sensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
neerer Poetry then Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
The Papists acknowledge a true
Heaven and Hell; but as they deal
with all other parts of Religion, so
to these they add some, Suburbs, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Limbo's</hi> and Purgatories of
their own invention. But the
Scriptures set forth the true Heaven
and the true Hell, in a most perfect
manner, becommig the Mercy and
Justice of an Infinite God, and befit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Spiritual nature of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:53793:146"/>
capable thereof. Wicked men
perswade themselvs that God who
made them will not damn them, or
at most that they shall only suffer to
the purging away of their Sin: and
then afterward — <hi>Vbi mille ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam
volvere per annos, as Origen</hi>
held even of the Divells, they shall
be released: because their Sins can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
hurt God, therefore they think
God will not hurt them. <hi>Thou
thoughtest,</hi> saith God, <hi>I was altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
such a one as thy self: but I will
reprove thee, and set thy sins in order
before thine Eies.</hi> He is so far from
any such blind and dull negligence,
that he will bring forth all their sins,
and set every one of them in order,
attired with all their Circumstances,
and exactly proportion punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to them by a most just and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
compensation. He who would
suffer none to escape in this life
whom he had cursed with a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Curse, but most severely pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
the foolish pity of <hi>Saul,</hi> in
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:53793:146"/>
sparing <hi>Agag;</hi> and <hi>Achan</hi> for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
only a wedge of Gold and
a <hi>Babylonish</hi> Garment of the spoil
of that execrated City; who drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the old World with a Deluge,
and saved only eight Persons in the
Ark, will certainly in a most exact
manner execute his great <hi>Anathema</hi>
and finall doom against Sinners,
whereof those former examples
seem to be but the types, and the
evidences of his severe wrath; the
perfection whereof is reserved for
Hell. These things are no Monkery,
nor Christian Poetry, no <hi>Bruta ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mina,</hi>
but most certain truths
grounded on Reason and Scripture.
<hi>God is not slack, as men count slack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
nor rigid as they count rigor:
but as he perfectly hates Sin, so he
will perfectly punish it; and go to
the very utmost <hi>Apex</hi> and <hi>Puntilio</hi>
of Justice, that so his Justice may
be manifested to the utmost. Hell
is the privation of all Good things,
depriving the irreligious Cardinall
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:53793:147"/>
at once both of his part in <hi>Paris,</hi>
and of his part in Paradise.
There the voluptuous <hi>Dives</hi> hath
not the least drop of water to cool
the tip of his tong, but is exprobra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and tormented aswell with the
remembrance of the good things
which he formerly enjoied, as of the
evill thing he suffers. But Heaven it
self is that which doth infinitely
provoke the envy of the Divells
and the Damned; making the great
Tyrants and cruell Persecuters of
the world to gnash their teeth, when
they behold a poor <hi>Lazarus,</hi> whom
thay disdained to diet with their
dogs, advanced to so high a Glory,
and trampling on their captive
necks. Hence they conceiv as much
torment, as they see the Saints enjoy
of bliss: for this is the nature of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Envy, to be as much vexed in it
self, as it apprehendeth Happiness
in another. <hi>Coelum est altera Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henna
damnatorum.</hi> The sensible
sufferings of Hell are the other part
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:53793:147"/>
thereof, the <hi>Tunica molesta,</hi> which
covers the whole Man all over with
pain and misery. The pains of the
Body are set out by the terrible vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence
of Fire and Sulphur, which
are put for the whole power of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
armed with all its weapons
and engines, and sharpned to the
quickest activity it hath, yea be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the present condition thereof,
as the Body it self shall be then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified,
only to endure those tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
which now would consume it
in a moment: Yea, through this
Hellish discord and distemper it
shall become a most perfect engine
of its own Misery, more then all
the externall impressions of <hi>Sicilian</hi>
or <hi>Turkish</hi> tortures, the tedious
Tragedy of <hi>Raviliac,</hi> or the horrible
Disease of a dying <hi>Antiochus.</hi> But
the Soul, which is the chief Sinner,
shall be chief Mourner at its own
Funerall. God who made it, and
knows how to punish it, shall cause
his wrath to pierce into the very In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:53793:148"/>
and Vitalls of it, which no
other Creature can reach. His
dreadfull Ey shall shoot beams of
Vengeance through and through
the damned Spirits. Every wicked
man carrieth about him his own
Hell, and layeth up barrells of
Gunpowder against that time:
which when the breath of the Lord
like a flame of fire shall once have
kindled, will blow him up, and fill
the Soul and all the faculties thereof
with an universall conflagration. Sin
is the fuell of this fire which shall
never fail: for neither shall the
Guilt thereof be purged away by
Suffering, nor the Power be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
by Punishing, but they shall
for ever rage and blaspheme his
name through the sense of their pain
and anguish, and for ever be punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for it. Thus shall God to the
utmost fight against the damned, and
they against him to all Eternity.
<hi>There shall be no discharge in that
was.</hi> This Wheel of Eternity is that
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:53793:148"/>
on which the Soul shall be perfectly
broken; that Abyss which renders
the pit of Hell bottomless, and the
continuall sense thereof is the most
bitter Ingredient in every moment
of suffering, making the Soul endure
all at once, through the constant ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
of a succeeding perpetui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
Eternity begets that Monster,
Despair, which like a <hi>Medusa's</hi>
head, astonisheth with its very
aspect, and strangles Hope, which is
the breath of the Soul: as it is said,
<hi>Dum spiro spero,</hi> so it may be invert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<hi>Dum spero spiro.</hi> Other miseries
may wound the Spirit, but Despair
kils it dead. Now a Christian en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joies
Hell in a contrary manner, as
the damned are tormented with
the sight of Heaven. <hi>Gehenna est
alterum Coelum beatornm.</hi> The mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series
of this Life commend Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
unto us, much more the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Hell. Deliverance from
great dangers affect the Soul far
more then perpetuall security.
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:53793:149"/>
When a man shall consider with
himself, that he was in the same
condemnation with others, and yet
is pardoned and preferred while
they are executed, it will make him
hug himself, and fill his Soul with
the sense of a double delight, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
as much joy in his delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
as there is torment in others
suffering.

It is at present a naturall delight,
but not without some tincture of
cruelty to behold the Tragedy of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:
but when the Justice of God
hath once past sentence upon the
damned, as they shall for ever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
from him, so shall they also de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
from us: and then all Humane
Relations, the grounds of Pity shall
cease, and be swallowed up in the
Love of God; so that we shall as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:53793:149"/>
rejoyce in his Justice, and their
Punishment, as God himself, who
hath said, <hi>He will laugh at their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.
Let the Saints be joifull in
Glory, let them sing upon their beds:
Let the high praises of God be in

in their Hand; To execute venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
upon the Heathen, and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
upon the People; To bind their
Kings with Chains, and their Nobles

them the judgement written. This

Of Heaven.</head>
               <p>HEaven is the contrary of Hell,
but far more glorious then
Hell is miserable. It is not only a
paradise, or reduction of Man to his
primitive state of perfection, but an
higher exaltation of his nature, as
far above it in Glory, as it is in si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation.
Though Man was created
perfect according to that state in
which he was then made, yet he was
capable of an higher perfection;
and that capacity was not imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
but the foundation of this
greater perfection; not a want of
any thing which he then ought to
have, but only an absence of that
which he might afterward have. As
a Child in the womb is a perfect
Child, and of a more excellent na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
then the <hi>Foetus</hi> of any Beast,
though it be not perfect in all the
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:53793:150"/>
degrees and operations of Man; so
is Man in the womb of this World:
or as the Apostle expresseth it by a
Grane or Seed, which is a perfect
Grane, but not a perfect Ear of
Corn, though it be the Seed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
As Redemption was the End of
Creation, so is Glorification the
End of Humane Perfection. The
Body shall be changed in qualities,
but not in substance, for it must still
continue the same, and not be tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiated.
It shall be cleansed
and purified, not only from all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
imperfections, as Pains, and
Diseases, and all Distempers, or
Deformities; but also be stripped
of all those naturall Virtues, which
are inferior perfections, serv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to supply the present ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities
thereof, as Eating, Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Matrimony, and the like. For
as in the naturall state Augmentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ceaseth, when a man hath at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
his <hi>Acme,</hi> so shall Nutrition
and Generation, when he shall thus
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:53793:151"/>
be perfected in himself, and in his
whole <hi>Species.</hi> Then also all the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of these inferior delights shall
cease. As it is the sumptuous excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
of a great feast to want all
grosser meats, being furnished with
more curious dainties; so it is the
super-excellency of Heaven to want
them all. The Crowns and Scepters
of the most glorious Princes, their
rich Treasures, their Pomps, and
Triumphs, and Roiall State, and all
the Glory of the world, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
of the sons of men are so
much inferior and heterogeneall to
Heaven, that they cannot mingle
with the pure nature thereof: and
so far from adding the least mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to that weight of Glory, that
like the dust of the Balance, they
would rather defile it: which
shows the perfect Vanity of all
those worldly things whereof we
formerly discoursed, though in this
Life they are the Handmaids of
Happiness, to do the drudgery
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:53793:151"/>
thereof, yet must they then, when
there shall be no more use of them,
turned out of their service. Surely
<hi>Mahomets</hi> Heaven is very mean
and base which is made up of the
dross and refuse of the true Heaven
of Christians. The Body being thus
stripped of all those Husks, shall be
endued with all Glorious qualities,
and perfectly fitted to serv and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
the Soul, which now is forced
to drudge for the Body, and lay in
Provision for it, as the Wise man
saith, <hi>All labor is for his mouth, and
yet the Appetite is not satisfied:</hi> but
then the main and only Business shall
be Spirituall; and therefore the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
calls it a Spiritual Body, not a
Spirit, but advanced to the neerest
likeness whereof it is capable, and
made as fit an Instrument for the
Spirit as may be. Probably it
shall be purified and sublimated to
the perfection of the Celestiall
matter, which is the purest part o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
the whole Body of the world, and
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:53793:152"/>
the Country or Region wherein
Man shall live for ever: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as now living on the Earth his
Body is sutable and connaturall to
it, so when he shall be taken up to
Heaven it shall be refined to the
temper thereof: and shall need
none of <hi>Mahomets</hi> Loadstones to
lift it up, but like the Stars in their
Orbs move in the highest Heaven
of Heavens most freely and natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
Thus the Apostle speaking of the
resurrection of the Body seems to
argue, <hi>Flesh and Blood cannot inherit
the Kingdom of God, neither can Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
inherit Incorruption:</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
<hi>The first Man was of the Earth
Earthly, the second Man is the Lord
from Heaven; as we have born the
Image of the Earthly, so we shall also
bear the Image of the Heavenly.</hi> This
is the highest perfection whereof
the Body is capable, and was reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
for Christ the second <hi>Adam,</hi> and
his glorified members: as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
doth also infer. <hi>Howbeit that
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:53793:152"/>
was not first which was Spirituall, but
that which was Naturall, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
that which was Spirituall.</hi> As
God is the Light of that place, so the
Soul is the Ey which shall see him,
and immediately enjoy him: and as
the Body, so the Soul much more
shall then be discharged of all Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections,
as Errors, Lusts, and the
like: Reason and Discourse, yea,
Faith it self shall then be resolved
into Vision; Desire into Joy, and
Hope into Fruition. Not only all
Sin shall be excluded out of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
but also many inferior Graces,
which now serv to bring us thither.
The Soul shall then attain an higher
perfection then it hath or can have in
this world: God saith, <hi>No man can
see him and live,</hi> that is, no living Man
can possibly see him, though the
common <hi>Iews</hi> did interp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>therwise, as appears by the Story of
<hi>Manoah,</hi> yet <hi>Moses</hi> who saw as
much of God as man could do, did
not therefore dy. But he saw only his
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:53793:153"/>
Backparts, or Attributes, which are
but the demonstrations of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
in Heaven we shall <hi>behold
him face to face, and know him as we
are known;</hi> according to the utmost
capacity of finite Creatures: and
thus the Soul shall be wholly filled
with the sight of God, as the Ey is
filled with Light, possessing and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying
it in it self, and changed by
it into the same Glory. Then shall
we also love God as we are loved of
him; yea, as he loves himself accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to our finite capacity; and so
accordingly partake of the same
Happiness which he enjoieth in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self:
which is a most wonderfull
and inconceivable Blessedness; and
therefore sensuall and carnall men
who are only acquainted with the
Creatures, wholly neglect it, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

true Christian may satisfy himself
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:53793:153"/>
with this, that though he cannot
comprehend this future Blessedness
fully and particularly, yet in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
he believs it to be the highest
and purest Happiness whereof he is
capable. Every Vessell of Mercy, as
a Vessell, shall be made only to hold
Mercy, and be wholly filled with it;
Yet shall not all the Saints be equall
in Glory, but differ therein, as in
Grace: for though all the Spirits of
Just men shall be then made perfect,
yet they shall be proportionably
perfected in Glory according to
their degrees of Grace, by an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithmeticall,
not by a Geometricall
proportion: as in the Parable of
the Talents, He who gained two
Talents, was made Ruler over two
Cities in his Lords Kingdome: and
he who gained five Talents was
made Ruler over five Cities. There
is no proportion between <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>
and Cities, yet there is a proportion
between Two and Two, and beween
Five and Five. Thus shall we be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compensed
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:53793:154"/>
according to our works,
though not for our works: and this
may be as great and quick an inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
to working, as the proud opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of merit, attaining the same ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
and ending in the same reward
of Blessedness. And though there
cannot properly be any merit in the
Creature, but only a performance
of Covenants; yet the obedience
of Angels, through that Grace
which was first implanted in their
Nature, and never forfeited, is far
short of this free Grace of God in
Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which as it is a manifestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
