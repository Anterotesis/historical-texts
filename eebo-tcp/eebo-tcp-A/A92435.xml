         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
REMONSTRANCE
OF THE
APPRENTICES
In and about London.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S we do no leſs wonder at the wiſe orderings and Government of God in theſe many changes and viciſſitudes, which within
theſe twelve years have befallen theſe miſerable and deſtracted Nations, then thoſe who pretend to be guided by theſe lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Providences (as they call them) meaſuring and calculating by them, not God, but by their own ends and intereſts of
one another; ſo we hope we ſhall not uncharitably be cenſured if we preſume alſo (with reverence we ſpeak it) to conſtrue
ſome of theſe Diſpenſations otherwiſe then thoſe men will think fit or allow, being confident how e're we may erre in the
inſcrutable ways and counſels of God, we ſhall hardly erre in the diſcovering and inveſtigating the practices and contrivements
of thoſe men, who have and do exalt themſelvs by the depreſſion and debaſement of the whole Kingdom: And therefore for the encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of one another in theſe our Juſt and Honoſt Reſolutions, we have preſumed to publiſh this our REMONSTRANCE, to the
end the World may ſee that we are not totally degenerated (as our Enemies ſlander us) from the Ancient Spirit of Honour and Gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
for which this Renowned City hath been ſo long and deſervedly Famed. We could take an Eſtimate of our ſelves from the repute
the Parliament had of Us in the years 43, 44, 45, &amp;c. were it not that we take no pleaſure in the remembrance of our unhappy Valour, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
waſted a great deal of brave Blood in the purchaſing of our ſhame, and in ſerving the ambitious Deſigns of ſome Grandees, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs
we have ſeen fruſtrated and diſappointed as well as our good intentions deluded; But we intend not to inſiſt on our Reputation,
thereby to raiſe any opinion or expectation of us or our Abi'ities and Power, (we could pleaſe our ſelves better in the remembrance of that
peaceable and quiet poſture this deteſtable War found us in) further then to vindicate and aſſert this our REMONSTRANCE from
being deemed or cenſured frivolous, and our Concernments mean and inconſiderable, whereas our ſhare and part in either a well eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
or ſubverted Government is of as much moment as any conditions of Engliſhmen whatſoever; and that, were it the purpoſe of this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
we could plainly and fully prove. Seeing therefore the many imminent and impendent dangers, which highly threaten theſe Nations,
and in particular Our Selves, both in the decay and loſs of Trade, and ſome other dormant wills, which time we fear will ſoon bring to light,
we do Declare and Remonſtrate,</p>
            <p>1. As for <hi>Religion</hi> we are not ignorant what a blind it hath been to us in preciptating us into very dangerous Actions, when we knew not
what it was, nor what a Cloak and Colour it hath been for the moſt enormous perpetrations, we may ſadly compare it (we mean here the
name of it) to that Trojan Horſe, which that people with ſo much reverence and ſolemnity received and entertained, being filled within with
armed men, that preſently ſacked their City. We cannot well ſay whether more Sects or Miſchiefs have ſprung meerly from hence; &amp; therefore
it is high time now we ſhould conſider how to attain the ſubſtance of that whoſe ſhadow hath coſt ſo dearly. For our parts we do declare,
That the Religion eſtabliſhed in this Kingdom by Law in the Reins of our three laſt Princes, with ſome amendment in Diſcipline, is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
true and perfect pattern of Divine Worſhip. We are very ſenſible what Inconveniencies Innovations bring with them, we ſhrewdly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>j<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cture 
that that cry of <hi>No Biſhops</hi> hath been ſadly ecchoed with the complaint of <hi>No Trade,</hi> eſpecially to the Rabble that were moſt clamo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
in that <hi>Crucifige.</hi> We will not preſume to interpoſe our opinion in matters Eccleſiaſtical any further, we intend not to give Laws to
any, but this is generally our own private judgement, by which (as God ſhall pleaſe) we are reſolved to ſtand or fall.</p>
            <p>2. We will aſſert with our Lives and Fortunes the Laws of this Land and Liberty of the Subject, as for the ſubſequent clauſe the
freedome of Parliament, we will not be ſo ridiculous as to mention it, it being exploded and hiſt like the Members themſelves out of doors;
yet we cannot but caſt a tranſient eye upon that buſineſſe, and ſee how juſtly thoſe men are repayed, who for a pretended violation of
their privileges ſo forwardly imbrued this Nation in blood, and now cannot find any one that will expend a tear for their total diſſolution,
Orphans and Widows tears they have too many. But to return from this digreſſion, wee look upon the Laws as our Birth-right, that diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butive
part of Juſtice, that gives to every one his due, we have therefore highly wondered at the ſtrange Attemps of this late Parliament,
who by their forfeitures, ſales, undue and arbitrary proceedings in all Courts of Iuſtice in erecting new ones, have left ſuch a model of
Tyranny, that we fear it may be a Iuſtifiable precedent for any exorbitant Practices of ſucceeding Governours. We hope however that
though our Laws have run ſo long in ſo bad and corrupt a Channel, yet the freedome of the Air (more ſerene and quiet times which we
hope are approaching) may purge them of that ill ſmack they have contracted in the conveyance, and that the filth will ſettle with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in the bottom, and when we have reſcued and ſecured our LAWS (as we will endeavour to doe if the ſame FORCE continue as
hath done for theſe many years laſt paſt) from uſurpation, we ſhall not need to trouble our ſelves concerning the LIBERTY of the SUB<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>JECT,
that being bound up ſafe and ſecure in the Iuſtice and due execution of the LAWS.</p>
            <p>3. We ſhall now ſpeak more peculiarly in relation to the Eſtate and condition we are now in, that is, in reference to TRADE ſo dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
and decayed, that we know no fitter Heroglyphick of it than thoſe ſeven <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s lean Kine; ſince theſe ſeven years laſt paſt have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
devoured the Wealth and Credit that this CITY had for ſeven hundred years before. The other two RELIGION and LAWS are
as the <hi>Eſſe</hi> but to us conſidered ſimply and abſtractedly, as Citizens TRADE is that <hi>bene eſſe</hi> the proſperity and felicity of this place; and as
the Aegyptians gathered the fertility of their Country by the increaſe of the River <hi>Nile,</hi> ſo may wee the Plenty and Riches of ours by the
increaſe of TRADE. That Maxime of keeping us poor and there will be the more Souldiers is none of the falſeſt, but whoſe part ſuch
Souldiers will take is all the diſpute; we think the Advice of <hi>Henry</hi> the 4th to his Son the Prince was more prudential, where ſpeaking of
this City, ſaith he, keep their purſes faſt and you keep their hearts; For though the ripe iniquity of the late times and that exceſſe of plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
(never known before in LONDON) accelerated this Judgement on us, yet are we ready to redeem our Errors, and if God ſhall put an
opportunity in our hands will find or make away out of this Laborynth, into which by the cunning inſinuations of ſome deſperate Perſons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
us we were formerly ſeduced.</p>
            <p>But for what TRADE ſhall we now declare, or what means are there viſible to advance it, ſince the Spaniard hates us, the Dutch be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traies
us, the French ſlights us, neither have we any ſecurity either of Perſons or Eſtates in their Dominions, further than their will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure;
and how can we reaſonably expect that abroad which we cannot promiſe to our ſelves at home; we cannot hope like the Army to
live by an Inland TRADE, ſure we muſt not ſend all our Commodities for <hi>Iamaca?</hi> what will be the iſſue? why before all's gone, as the
Parliament Dined with us, ſo the Army muſt Break-faſt with us, and perhaps for Supper may meet with the <hi>Sicilian</hi> Veſpers.</p>
            <p>There is only one expedient to recover and retreive our Religion, Laws, and Trade, that is a returning to the Condition and State of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
where we begun, in the doing whereof, it <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
