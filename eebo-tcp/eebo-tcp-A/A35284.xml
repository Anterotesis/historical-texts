            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>My Lord,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>PErhaps Your Lordſhip may admire to ſee your Name fixt before this trifle; But it is the Fate of Perſons of Your obliging temper, to receive Perſecutions of this nature, in return of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour and Indulgence; which I muſt confeſs is ſo ill a requital, as it may make Your Lordſhip cautious hence-forwards of beſtowing Your Favours, ſince this muſt be the troubleſome conſequence. But Greatneſs like Beauty attracts all on whom it ſmiles; And We frail writing ſinners cannot content our ſelves with the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret enjoyment; but think half the pleaſure loſt, if we do not boaſt of it to the world. This vanity occaſions your Lordſhip the preſent trouble; And next to this, a deſign to over-aw with Your Name, any the briskeſt enemies this Poem may meet with; For when I tell 'em, Your Lordſhip thinks it not much unworthy your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, they will judge moderately of it; at leaſt, not be too forward in cenſuring any thing, which you are plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to defend. The enemies it ha's already met with have been fewer, then a Play in Verſe, (and an ill one too,) could expect; conſidering how many there are, that exclaim againſt Rhime, though never ſo well writ. Some of 'em I'me afraid do it from the ſame unjuſt picque that Women of cruel hearts, but peaceable Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ever have againſt a Mode, wherewith they deſpair to kill. But I ſhall not much concern my ſelf with their little quarrel; I am fortunate enough in your Lordſhips approbation, and can diſpenſe with the reſt of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.
<pb facs="tcp:54729:4"/>
And this I am bold to affirm though I have not the Honour of much acquaintance with your Lordſhip; for it is ſufficient that I have ſeen in ſome little sketches of your Pen excellent Maſteries and a Spirit inimitable; and that I have been entertained by others with the wit, which your Lordſhip with a gentile &amp; careleſs freedom, ſprinkles in your ordinary converſe, and often ſupplies vulgar and neceſſitous wits wherewith to enrich them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and ſometimes to treat their friends; and when your Lordſhip is pleaſed to aſcend above us, You do it with a ſtrange readineſs and agility of mind, and by ſwift and eaſy motions attain to heights, which others by much climbing dull induſtry, and conſtraint cannot reach. Nor is this vaſt wit crowded together in a little Soul, where it wants freedom, and is uneaſy, but fills up the ſpaces of a large and generous mind, infinitely delighting to oblige all, but eſpecially to encourage any bloſſoming merits; and ready to forgive large and voluminous faults for the ſake of any one thing tolerably ſaid or done. And now the world ſure will not blame me that I eſteem my ſelf extremely happy in Your Favour, and ſecure in Your Patronage; and this being to me, like ſome great and ſudden Fortune to the poor, I know not how to manage my own tranſports, but muſt make my brags to my Friends. This my Lord, is a great infirmity, but it is incident to humane Nature, and very common with all of our Tribe; and I do not doubt but your Lordſhip will pardon it among other defects to</p>

            <l>WIth how much patience have you heard to day</l>
            <l>The whining noiſe of a dull Rhiming Play?</l>
            <l>This obstinate incorrigible Rhime,</l>
            <l>Though laſht by all the Criticks of the time;</l>
            <l>Our dulleſt writers can no more forbear,</l>
            <l>Then your ill faces Vizard Maſcks to wear,</l>
            <l>Yet you appear'd ſo grave and ſo devout,</l>
            <l>You neither hiſt nor stamp to put us out,</l>
            <l>A thing our Criticks would no more ha' done,</l>
            <l>Then to a dull Phanatick meeting gone;</l>
            <l>And there amongſt a ſerious whining Throng,</l>
            <l>Stay'd out a holding forth of nine hours long.</l>
            <l>As for the Play our Author will not dare,</l>
            <l>Like you good men of Trade to praiſe his Ware:</l>
            <l>But unskill<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d Cuſtomers he may adviſe;</l>
            <l>Then Sirs, ſince on your verdict it relies,</l>
            <l>Reſolve to ſave the Play before you go,</l>
            <l>For fear it ſhuld be good for ought you know.</l>
            <l>How 'ere it makes Heroick Virtue ſhine</l>
            <l>In Royal Breaſts, where it ſhews moſt Divine.</l>
            <l>And ſo does Kings and Monarchy advance,</l>
            <l>Nay guarded with the names of <hi>Charles</hi> and <hi>France,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Names that now ſhake the world, ſure you'l not dare</l>
            <l>To damn a Play, where tbeſe united are;</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:54729:44"/>
Let it be ne're ſo bad, who dares arreſt</l>
            <l>The meaneſt ſlave, that wears the Royal Creſt?</l>
            <l>Joyn not with ſmall Caballs of wit, that pry,</l>
            <l>How they may damn the Play, and no one ſpye;</l>
            <l>Being much aſhamed in theſe tame Wars t' appear,</l>
            <l>when their high mettle may be ſhewn elſewhere.</l>
            <l>Now they'r divided let's have aid from you,</l>
            <l>Them and their factious party to ſubdue;</l>
            <l>Then e're the Parliament of Wits that ſate,</l>
            <l>And govern'd here like a proud petty State,</l>
            <l>Return from Sea in a triumpkant rage,</l>
            <l>We'l get a full poſseſſion of the Stage;</l>
            <l>Mean while our Poet with your Forces joyn'd,</l>
            <l>May damn the Rump of Wits that ſtay behind.</l>
