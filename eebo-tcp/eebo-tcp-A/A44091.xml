            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>A Day or Two ago, upon my Return out of the Country, I receiv'd your <hi>Letter,</hi> which had lain some time expecting me: In which you are pleas'd to advise me, concerning a <hi>Report</hi> industriously spread abroad, by the Abettors of our present <hi>Schism,</hi> That the <hi>Treatise</hi> against it, which I lately Translated out of the <hi>Baroccian</hi> MS. is <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially,</hi> and <hi>Deceitfully</hi> publish't; That there are some <hi>Canons</hi> belonging to it omitted, which would, if publisht, have <hi>unravel'd</hi> the Whole. I had heard of such a Report before I receiv'd your <hi>Letter,</hi> but I rather admir'd at the <hi>Heat</hi> and <hi>Iudgment</hi> of those
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:103389:3"/>
that first rais'd it, then thought it worthy to be taken notice off by me, and refuted. I could hardly believe, that they, that were the Authors of it, were really in <hi>earnest,</hi> when first the <hi>Noise</hi> was made; and, if they were in earnest, I knew that their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were <hi>determin'd</hi> by so strong a <hi>Biuss</hi> of <hi>Resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> and <hi>Zeal</hi> for a <hi>Cause,</hi> that all men must easily perceive it. I could not perswade my self, that any Person of common <hi>Ingenuity</hi> and <hi>Candour,</hi> could be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve me guilty of so <hi>dull</hi> a Piece of <hi>Knavery,</hi> a <hi>Kna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very</hi> so easily <hi>discoverable,</hi> and that by my own <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</hi> It was really very <hi>entertaining</hi> to observe, to what little <hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>Shiftings</hi> our Adversaries were reduc'd. I plainly saw by their <hi>Passion,</hi> and their holding up <hi>dirty Hands,</hi> that I had given 'em a <hi>Fall.</hi> And I could not wonder, that so <hi>small</hi> a Person as your Friend should be so <hi>stigmatiz'd,</hi> when even <hi>Cecilianus,</hi> the great Arch-Bishop of <hi>Carthage,</hi> was, by the Schismatical <hi>Donatists,</hi> call'd downright <note n="*" place="margin">

               <hi>Knave,</hi> in a Letter to the Emperour <hi>Constantine</hi>; and that too, tho He himself had <hi>Iudicially</hi> acquitted him, and declar'd him a worthy Arch-Bishop. 'Tis this is the <hi>Humour,</hi> and indeed the <hi>Vnhappiness,</hi> of Mankind: If in your <hi>Opinions,</hi> or <hi>Actions,</hi> you chance to run counter to a <hi>Party,</hi> there is no expecting of <hi>Quarter:</hi> you are fallen in among <hi>Rapparees,</hi> and, if it lies in their power, <hi>God have mercy upon you,</hi> you will certainly <hi>fall</hi> by one <hi>Weapon</hi> or other; you must either be a <hi>Fool</hi> or a <hi>Knave.</hi> Where the <hi>Bluntness</hi> of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer will not <hi>pierce,</hi> there the <hi>Sharpness</hi> of the latter must be try'd. They will <hi>stab</hi> one at the <hi>Heart,</hi> if they cannot <hi>knock</hi> one on the <hi>Head.</hi> This they will be sure to endeavour to do: but the best of it is, it

                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> I was confident it would prove so with me: I knew it was impossible, that the <hi>Dirt,</hi> wherewith I was so freely and bountifully <hi>bespatter'd,</hi> should <hi>stick</hi> long upon me, that a little <hi>Time</hi> would of course <hi>dry</hi> it off; and if not so, 'twould however come out by the least <hi>Rubbing.</hi> The Design of those, that first blew abroad that strange and <hi>improbable</hi> Rumour, was so obvious to all, that would give themselves leave to <hi>Think,</hi> that I could not imagine, any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of sound Understanding could possibly give Ear to it: The <hi>Fort</hi> I had <hi>happily</hi> rais'd was very <hi>strong</hi> and <hi>impregnable, well-man'd</hi> with stout and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querable <hi>Veterans</hi>; and who could not see through so common and usual a <hi>Stratagem,</hi> as that of a <hi>False Report?</hi> What else could be done to keep up the <hi>sink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> Spirits of the Adverse Party? It was necessary they should be <hi>perswaded,</hi> that tho there was an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of many <hi>Brave</hi> Men upon the <hi>Walls,</hi> yet there lay in the <hi>Town</hi> conceal'd, a much stronger Party, <hi>Well-wishers</hi> to Them, that would shew Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves shortly, discover the <hi>Weakness</hi> of the rest, and deliver up the <hi>Place.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These Considerations, <hi>Sir,</hi> made me altogether <hi>secure,</hi> and <hi>regardless</hi> of that <hi>idle</hi> and <hi>unlikely Tale:</hi> But you blame me, you say; I must not any longer despise it; It is still, as you tell me, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd, and by many believ'd. And the Author of a <hi>Pamphlet</hi> entitl'd, <hi>An Apology for the New Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp;c.</hi> has made a publick Complaint of my <hi>Disin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity</hi> in this matter? He says, he is <hi>assur'd by his Friends in Oxford,</hi> that that <hi>Collection of Canons,</hi> which follows our <hi>Tract</hi> in the MS. is a part of the <hi>Tract,</hi> and that it shews plainly, that the Author
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:103389:4"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the <hi>Tract,</hi> when he contends, That <hi>A Bishop un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly depos'd ought not to make a Division in the Church provided his Successor be Orthodox,</hi> is to be understood of onely a <hi>Synodical Deprivation</hi>; By which he means, that the Author of the Treatise supposes, that, if a Bishop unjustly depriv'd, be depriv'd by a <hi>Secular Power,</hi> and not by a <hi>Synod of Bishops,</hi> then he is not oblig'd not to make a Separation. Upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, I see 'tis high time to <hi>rowse</hi> up my self a little, since <hi>the Philistins are</hi> so much <hi>upon me.</hi> I shall now, <hi>Sir,</hi> obey your Commands, in laying before you those <hi>Canons</hi> which our Adversaries so much boast off, and the <hi>Reasons</hi> why I did not publish 'em to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Treatise; That you your self may judge what a <hi>Nothing</hi> that is, that has made such a <hi>Bounce</hi>; that 'tis onely <hi>meer Powder,</hi> that can hurt no one else but the Person that <hi>Fires.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the first place, <hi>Sir,</hi> I must assure you, That when I transcrib'd our <hi>Treatise</hi> out of the <hi>Baroccian</hi> MS. I did it as an <hi>Historian,</hi> or a <hi>Philologer,</hi> or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever else you will call it, not imagining then, I should ever send it abroad upon such an Occasion: If therefore the aforesaid <hi>Canons</hi> do truly belong to the <hi>Treatise,</hi> it is to be imputed to the <hi>error</hi> and <hi>mistake</hi> of my <hi>Iudgment,</hi> and not to an <hi>ill Design,</hi> that they are omitted. I perus'd 'em, I remember, at that time, and they seem'd to me (as still they do) not at all to belong to the <hi>Treatise.</hi> They are written, I grant, in the same hand, and immediatly follow the <hi>Treatise,</hi> but (for God-sake!) what then? Are they therefore a part of the foregoing Treatise? What a wretched Judgment must that needs be, that can draw so strange a Conclusion? Here I cannot but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn you that <hi>Story,</hi> which once, I remember, you told
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:103389:4"/>
me, of that poor Country Person who would needs have the <hi>Book-binder</hi>'s <hi>Leaf</hi> to be a part of his <hi>Bible:</hi> He was told, it came after the <hi>Index</hi> that was in that Bible, and was not at all to the Purpose; no matter for that, it was Printed, he said, in the very same Letter, and must therefore needs be a Part. If you pittied the <hi>Simpleness</hi> of that poor Man, what, <hi>Sir,</hi> will you say, when you see even <hi>Learned</hi> and otherwise <hi>Worthy</hi> Men so much prostitute their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to <hi>Resentment</hi> and the <hi>serving of a Cause,</hi> that rather then not be <hi>Reveng'd</hi> on the <hi>saucy</hi> Publisher of so <hi>pestilent</hi> a Treatise, and supply their Adherents with an <hi>Antidote</hi> against it, they will let themselves down to the lowest degree of <hi>Absurdness?</hi> We grant that our <hi>Treatise</hi> and the <hi>Canons,</hi> that follow it, are written in a <hi>Hand</hi> somewhat different from the rest of the <hi>Volume:</hi> But what can be thence concluded? Are our Adversaries so extreamly Strangers to MS. Volumes, as not to know, that, as they consist very often of several Treatises, and of several Hands, so many times they have <hi>two</hi> Tracts together, or more, of one Hand? This is true in particular of that very Volume, out of which our <hi>Treatise</hi> was publisht. The other Parts of the Volume, besides our <hi>Treatise</hi> and the <hi>Canons,</hi> are not all written in the same Hand, but in several: In one Hand two or three Treatises, in another two or three Others; it being made up of the Pieces of several Volumes bound together.</p>
            <p>First, <hi>Sir,</hi> it is to be observ'd, That he that Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrib'd that Volume, out of which the Leaves of our <hi>Treatise</hi> and the <hi>Canons</hi> were taken, and put into that in which they now ly; He, I say, that Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrib'd our <hi>Treatise</hi> and the <hi>Canons,</hi> seems himself to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:103389:5"/>
have took 'em for two distinct Pieces: For between the <hi>Abstract,</hi> or <hi>Summary,</hi> of the <hi>Treatise</hi> and the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the <hi>Canons,</hi> there is somewhat a <hi>wider</hi> Space, than between the Lines of the <hi>Treatise,</hi> or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Treatise</hi> and the <hi>Abstract</hi> of it. And what (I pray) if the <hi>Canons</hi> had been written just close upon the Treatise? I can shew you some <hi>Scores</hi> of Examples of <hi>Collections</hi> or <hi>Treatises</hi> wholy distinct, so closely connected in the Writing, without any Note of Distinction, that no one, but he that reads 'em, can possibly take 'em to be distinct. Who so little ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with this sort of Learning, as not to know, that <hi>Librarians,</hi> or Transcribers of Books, were oftentimes ignorant Persons, that did not at all under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand what they wrote, but, like <hi>Horace</hi>'s Painter, <hi>join'd</hi> oftentimes <hi>the Head of a Man to the Neck of a Horse?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Second place it is to be observ'd, That the <hi>Treatise</hi> as it is in the MS. and as it is publisht, is thus concluded: TO CONCLUDE ALL IN A WORD; ONE THING ONELY <hi>was requir'd by the Church (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> &amp;c.) that the new Bishop should profess the same (Orthodox) Faith with the other that was depos'd, but as for other Complaints and Accusations, except it were Heresy, she never made any Examination into them.</hi> What Person of so little Sagacity and Judgment, as not to see, that here the <hi>whole</hi> Treatise is ended?</p>
            <p>In the Third place, I shall give you as clear and plain a Demonstration, as can possibly be brought for the Confirmation of any thing of this Nature. It is this: Between the <hi>Conclusion</hi> of the <hi>Treatise,</hi> and the foresaid <hi>Collection of Canons,</hi> there comes in, in the MS. the <hi>Abstract</hi> or <hi>Summary</hi> of the Treatise,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:103389:5"/>
which stands, as it were, for an <hi>Index,</hi> as 'tis pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisht in borh the Editions. I cannot but admire, how it possibly could enter into any Man's Head, that that is a part of the <hi>Treatise,</hi> which follows the <hi>Abstract</hi> or <hi>Epitome</hi> of the Treatise.</p>
            <p>In the Fourth place, it is to be obsetv'd, and this is likewise as clear a Demonstration as any one can possibly desire, That the Canons which follow our Treatise are barely transcrib'd, not at all connected by any words of the Transcriber; Not a word of his in either the beginning, or the end, or mixt with 'em, as I know by comparing them with those that are Printed; When yet it is certain, that the Author of our Treatise does every where use his <hi>own</hi> Style. Neither does he make any mention, in any part of his Treatise, that he would subjoin any <hi>Canons.</hi> If the <hi>Canons</hi> had belong'd to the <hi>Treatise,</hi> 'tis ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd to imagine that the Author would have said no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of 'em, not exprest his Design in transcribing 'em. And if he had produc'd 'em, as our Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries would have it believ'd, to shew that in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going <hi>Treatise,</hi> he understood onely a <hi>Synodical De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privation,</hi> why does he not somewhere say so? Why make no mention of a <hi>Synodical Deprivation?</hi> Why leave us to judge of his <hi>meaning</hi> by his <hi>gaping?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This News, <hi>Sir,</hi> I know, will surprize you, which I tell you concerning the <hi>bareness</hi> of the Canons, that they are <hi>nakedly</hi> transcrib'd without any one Word added by the Transcriber; For you tell me, I remember, in your Letter, that they that talk of this Matter, are wont to bring this for an Argument that the <hi>Canons</hi> belong to the <hi>Treatise,</hi> That there are added some Words at the end of the <hi>Canons,</hi> which plainly refer to the <hi>Treatise.</hi> And for this,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:103389:6"/>
as you say, the Authority of a very great Man is wont to be quoted. Let me tell you, <hi>Sir,</hi> I can now <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

               </gap> 
               <hi>about</hi> with a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. It is true, The thing has been all along confidently affirm'd by a very great Man, as you very deservedly call him: But take my Word for't, You will hear no more of that Matter. I enquir'd, <hi>Sir,</hi> lately of that Learned and otherwise very Accurate Person, What Words those were which he meant; and I found he had mistaken a Part of the last of the Canons for the Words of the Transcriber. This is strange, <hi>you</hi> will say: I, for my part, shall say nothing of it; but leave it for others to judge. But this I must add, that the Words which were alleg'd by that Gentleman to be the Transcriber's own, supposing they were the <hi>Transcriber's,</hi> (as we know very well they are not) do contain nothing in 'em, that could prove the Transcriber to have been the same Man with our Author. There is nothing from whence it might be gather'd that the <hi>Canons</hi> did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to our <hi>Treatise;</hi> not a <hi>Tittle</hi> from whence it might be prov'd that our Author therefore transcrib'd 'em, to shew that he meant a <hi>Synodical Deprivation.</hi> You will judge of this by and by, by reading the Words your self. You will easily see, that Men, whose <hi>Eyes</hi> have contracted a <hi>Yellowness</hi> (whatsoever otherwise their <hi>Temper</hi> or <hi>Constitution</hi> may be,) read every thing agreeably to the <hi>Colour</hi> in their <hi>Heads.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I come now lastly to the <hi>Canons</hi> themselves; Let them speak for themselves: We need nothing else to refute the strange <hi>Fancy</hi> and <hi>Dream</hi> of our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries. The Argument, you know, of the <hi>Treatise,</hi> is to shew by many Examples, That it's <hi>contrary</hi> to the <hi>Practice</hi> of the <hi>Antients,</hi> for a Bishop unjustly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to recede from the Communion of an <hi>Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:103389:6"/>
Successor. Pray look with both Eyes, and see if you can possibly find in the <hi>Canons</hi> any thing truly pertinent to that particular Subject. The Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument and Design of them, is against private Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticles without a lawfull Presbyter: against a Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter or a Deacon's withdrawing from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of his Bishop without a just Cause: that a Bishop being condemn'd by the Bishops of the same Province, it shall not be in the power of the Bishops of another Province to take the matter into their Cognisance: against such Presbyters as shall sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from their Bishops on pretence of some Crimes they can charge 'em with, before they be legally convicted: against such Bishops as shall pretend to condemn their <hi>Metropolitan,</hi> and to leave his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion on pretence of his Vices, before he is legally condemn'd: and lastly, against such Metropolitans as shall act in like manner with relation to their <hi>Patriarch.</hi> I shall here translate you these Canons in the same order as they ly in the MS. In Doctor <hi>Beveridge</hi>'s <hi>Synodicon</hi> you may read 'em all in the Original.</p>

And if he goes on to raise Troubles and Seditions in the Church, let him be punisht by the Civil Power as a Rioter.</hi> How could this Canon be produc'd by the Author of our Treatise as pertinent to the Subject of it?

            <p>
               <hi>The XIII. Canon of the Council call'd the First and Second. The Devil scattering Heretical Seeds in the Church of Christ, and seeing them cut off at the Root by the Sword of the Spirit, has pitcht on another Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, and endeavours to divide the Body of Christ, by the Madness of Schismaticks<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The holy Council, in order to prevent this Snare as well as the other, has decreed, That if any Presbyter or Deacon having condemn'd his Bishop for any Crimes, shall dare to depart from his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, and refuse to recite his Name in the Publick Prayers of the Church, according to the usual Custom, before he be Synodically tryed and perfectly condemn'd, that Person shall be depos'd and depriv'd of all his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in the Priesthood. For any one plac't in the order of a Presbyter, if he takes upon him to prevent the Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:103389:8"/>
of the Metropolitan, and to condemn and pass Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence on his Father and Bishop, he is not worthy of the Honour or Name of a Presbyter. And they that adhere to such as have done so, if they are of the Priesthood, let them likewise be depriv'd of their Honour; if Monks, or of the Laity, let 'em be Excommunicated, till they leave the Schismatical Party, and return to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective Bishop.</hi> I shall pass a Remark on this, and the other two which follow, together.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The XIV. Canon of the same Council. If a Bishop upon charging his Metropolitan with a Crime, shall with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw from his Communion, and refuse to recite his Name in the publick Service of the Church according to Custom, before he is Synodically tryed; the holy Council decrees he be depos'd, upon Proof that he made such a Schism. For all Men ought to observe their proper Duties, and the Presbyter must not despise his Bishop, nor the Bishop his Metropolitan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The XV. Canon of the same. What has been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed concerning Presbyters, Bishops, and Metropolitans, the same is yet more reasonable with relation to Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs. If therefore any Presbyter, or Bishop, or Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan, shall dare to recede from the Communion of his Patriarch, and does not, according to Custom, recite his Name in the Publick-Service of the Church, but makes a Schism before his Patriarch has been Synodically try'd, and perfectly condemn'd; the holy Synod ordains, That, upon Proof made of such a Schism, he be depos'd.</hi>

               <hi>And these things are ordained and ratified concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing those who upon pretence of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Crimes shall separate from their respective Bishops, and make a Schism, and break the Communion of the Church. For they that separate
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:103389:8"/>
themselves from the Communion of their Bishop, for a Heresy condemn'd by the holy Fathers and Councils, he publickly professing and preaching the Heresy, shall be so far from being obnoxious to any Canonical Punishment, on the account of such a Separation, that they shall be honour'd as becomes true Believers. For in such a case they do not condemn true Bishops, but false Ones and they do not break the Vnity of the Church by a Schism, but endeavour to deliver the Church from Schisms and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions.</hi> Here ends the <hi>Collection of Canons.</hi> That which follows immediatly in the MS. is altogether forreign both to them and the Treatise, a Fragment of a Story concerning <hi>Artaxares</hi> and <hi>Chosroes</hi> of <hi>Persia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now, <hi>Sir,</hi> you have read all the so much cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated Canons, which have rais'd so great Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and been made the common <hi>Defence</hi> of those that have been prest with the Authority of the <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford Antiquity.</hi> When you light on any of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries of the <hi>Oxford Antiquity,</hi> pray shew 'em free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to them, and desire them to make their best of 'em: Much good may they do 'em. If you meet with any of 'em so very <hi>Iudicious,</hi> as to lay any Stress on the Mention that is made, in these Three last Canons, of a <hi>Synodical Deprivation</hi>; pray desire them to be so just to you, as to give you a Reason. Let 'em give you a Proof that those <hi>Canons</hi> are a Part of the <hi>Treatise.</hi> Let 'em shew how it makes for their Cause, that in them there is mention made of a <hi>Synodical Deprivation</hi>; how it proves that the Author of our Treatise is onely to be understood of a <hi>Synodical</hi> Deprivation. Desire 'em but to open their Eyes, and then they will plainly see, that the whole Design of those <hi>Canons,</hi> is onely against a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration from our Bishops, and the throwing off
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:103389:9"/>
Canonical Obedience upon our own private Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Pretences; that the Vices or Crimes of a Bishop ought not to be made an Occasion of a <hi>Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> unless he be <hi>legally</hi> and fully condemn'd and depriv'd. This is still the Doctrine of our Church; and what we in <hi>England</hi> call <hi>Legal,</hi> the <hi>Greeks,</hi> when they spoke with relation to Bishops, call'd a <hi>Synodical</hi> Deprivation, 'cause the ordinary way of Depriving Bishops amongst them, was by the <hi>Metropolitan,</hi> and the rest of the Bishops of the Province; who, <hi>by the Consent of the Emperour,</hi> were constituted the <hi>ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary</hi> Judges of the Causes of Bishops.</p>
            <p>I shall here add, that it is easy for any Man of Judgment to observe, That therefore the <hi>Canons,</hi> which we have above produc'd, were by some Body tackt to our <hi>Treatise</hi> in the MS. because of some kind of Relation which they seem to have to the <hi>General</hi> or <hi>Material</hi> Subject of the Treatise, <hi>viz. Schism</hi> and <hi>Bishops,</hi> tho they have not any Pertinency or Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the <hi>Formal</hi> or <hi>Particular</hi> Subject of it, <hi>The adhering to an Orthodox Bishop in possession, tho the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Bishop was unjustly turn'd out.</hi> We know, that most of those MS. Volumes, which now our Libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries afford us, were nothing else but so many Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes as it were of <hi>Common Places,</hi> in which Men of Learning and Study heapt together such Things as seem'd to them something akin. And hence it is, that in most Theological MSS. or at least in very many, you meet with <hi>Canons</hi> of Councils disperst up and down according to the Subject of the Treatise foregoing. Hence likewise many Fragments of the Fathers subjoin'd to Discourses of Divinity, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers out of the Historians subjoin'd to Historical Treatises, and the like. A Thousand Instances of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:103389:9"/>
this may be easily produc'd, if need were; but I shall not spend Pains and Paper in what will easily be granted by all that are acquainted with MSS.</p>
            <p>I must not here omit, that besides the Copy of our Treatise which we ow to the <hi>Baroccian</hi> Volume, there is at this time extant another in <hi>France.</hi> It is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd by the famous <hi>Cotelerius</hi> in his Notes upon the Third Volume of his <hi>Monumenta Ecclesiae Graecae.</hi> He quotes it under the Title of a Treatise <note n="*" place="margin">Offendi pariter in opusculo nunc inedito, olim si Deus dede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Concerning the famous Schism which was rais'd upon the account of</hi> Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sephus <hi>the Presbyter,</hi> and he says he intended to publish it. That that which he mentions is the same with our Treatise, appears by a certain Quotation of <hi>one of the Epistles of Methodius out of the Second Book of Nico,</hi> which is produc'd by <hi>Cotelerius</hi> out of it, and is in the very same words in our Treatise. Since I publisht the Treatise, I receiv'd this Observation from the Famous and Learned Mr. <hi>Dodwel.</hi> Now if any one is so very unwilling to be convinc'd, as not to be satisfied with what we have hitherto said, and he thinks it worth his Curiosity, he would do very well to desire an account of this <hi>Copy</hi> from some Body at <hi>Paris.</hi> It is, I suppose, to be found in the King's Library there, tho <hi>Cotelerius</hi> makes no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion where he had it. Five Hundred to One, but a Month or Six Weeks hence we may have a Report spread abroad, that Advice has been sent from <hi>Paris,</hi> that the aforesaid <hi>Canons</hi> are found in the MS. there in the self same manner as at <hi>Oxford.</hi> A spurious Letter, as from some considerable Man, the <hi>Libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:103389:10"/>
himself, or some other, will do very well for that purpose. This would be but a very dull <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posture,</hi> since the Canons make nothing to the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of the <hi>Treatise:</hi> However I shall here let you know, that it often happens, that Two distinct MS. Copies of a Treatise have the same things subjoin'd at the end of the Treatise. And the Reason is plain, <hi>viz<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Because they were either transcrib'd from one another, or are both <hi>descended</hi> from the same. I know, This is very Dry <hi>Food</hi> for a Person of so deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate and nice a <hi>Digestion</hi> as you are; But however I shall give you one Instance. We have here in <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> amongst the <hi>Baroccian</hi> MSS. a Copy of <hi>Anastasius Sinaita (Nicaenus</hi> some men miscall him) his <hi>Quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiones Theologicae</hi>; at the End of which there are added many Fragments of several Authors, which by the manner of Writing you would take to be part of the <hi>Work:</hi> Another ancient Copy of the same <hi>Work</hi> is extant in the aforesaid Library at <hi>Paris,</hi> in which the same Fragments are exactly found, as I know by a particular account of that Volume which I have met with; And yet it is certain that the Frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, we speak off, are not part of the Work of <hi>Anastasius,</hi> but annex'd to it by some ancient Libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian. Concerning the Schism which was rais'd upon the account of <hi>Iosephus the Presbyter,</hi> of which there is mention in the <hi>Paris</hi> Copy, as the occasion of our Treatises being written, I shall tell you something by and by.</p>
            <p>Before I utterly dismiss this Cause, I shall begg your leave to observe, that the <hi>Council</hi> call'd <hi>First and Second,</hi> to which the Three last of the Canons above translated, do belong, was a Council call'd under <hi>Photius</hi> the Patriarch of <hi>Constantinople</hi>; in
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:103389:10"/>
which the said <hi>Photius,</hi> tho made a Patriarch by the Emperour when <hi>Ignatius</hi> the Patriarch was <hi>unjustly</hi> depos'd by the Emperour's bare Authority, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd and own'd as rightful Patriarch, and that whilst <hi>Ignatius</hi> was living. And 'tis further observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, That that same Council consisted of so many Bishops as to be call'd by <hi>Balsamon,</hi> the learned Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch of <hi>Antioch,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>And thus much, <hi>Sir,</hi> for our <hi>Canons.</hi> The next thing I observe in your Letter, is what you tell me concerning a very learned and elaborate <hi>Answer,</hi> which you say is ready to be publisht, and very much talkt on, against the <hi>Oxford Antiquity.</hi> As for that, <hi>Sir,</hi> It is no News to Me, and no more than I ever expected.

               </gap> desire 'em to demonstrate, if they can, the Two general <hi>Propositions</hi> which follow.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That the Civil Government has not any Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in it self to deprive a Bishop of his Bishoprick, who refuses to own it, and to submit to it.</hi> And here they
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:103389:12"/>
are desired to consider, that the <hi>Civil Power</hi> or the <hi>Temporal Governors</hi> are no less of God's own Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion than <hi>Bishops</hi> or the <hi>Governors of the Church,</hi> that both are equally <hi>Iure Divino</hi> with this onely differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that the former are instituted by God for our Peace and Happiness here in this World, the latter to conduct us to Happiness in that which is to come; That the <hi>Secular</hi> Government is antecedent to the <hi>Spiritual;</hi> That when Christ came into the world to establish a Church, he came not to abolish any Law that was necessary for the support of the Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Government, not to set up a Church that was any ways opposite to it; But that he himself submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Secular Government which he found e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablisht, and commanded his Followers to do so; That after his Death the Apostles likewise did so, and commanded likewise all their Followers and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors to do the same, to submit to the Temporal Power <hi>as the Ordinance of God.</hi> It is plain that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour by establishing a Church, intended the establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of such things onely as might well consist with the Safety and the <hi>Essentials</hi> of Government. From hence it follows, that none has receiv'd any Power or Commission from Christ to preach the Gospel, or to preside over the Church in any Country, but with this <hi>Supposition,</hi> and on this <hi>Condition,</hi> that he own and submit to the Temporal Government which God has ordained in that Country. It is, I say, with this <hi>Supposition,</hi> That he gives his Bishops, and his Ministers, a Commission to preside over the Church, and to preach his Gospel in such or such a Country; It is upon the same Condition that the Church ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points 'em to preside or preach in that Place; and it is upon the same Condition that they are receiv'd,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:103389:12"/>
allow'd off, and protected by the State. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they fail of the Performance of that necessary Condition, their <hi>Commission</hi> then ceases as to that particular Government, which they cannot, or will not submit to. They become Deprivable by the State, and the Church is to constitute others who are willing to submit to the State, and whom the State shall approve of as fit to be trusted by it in that Post. Thus for Matters of Heresy; Christ has given no Authority to any to preach in his Name, or to govern in his Church, but on this <hi>Condition,</hi> that they preach and maintain the true Faith. If that <hi>Condition</hi> be not observ'd, the Church is then to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive 'em. In the Case of Heresy it belongs to the Church to Deprive, that being the proper Judge of that Question, What is the true Faith? In the Case of Rebellion, or of Non-submission to the Government, it belongs to the Government, as being the proper Judge of what is necessary for its own Support.</p>
            <p>I lay down this as a <hi>Principle,</hi> on which both the Power of the Church, of Depriving for <hi>Spiritual,</hi> and likewise the Power of the State, of Depriving for <hi>Political</hi> Crimes, does depend.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Query,</hi> What Security the <hi>Civil Government,</hi> which is God's own Institution, and antecedent to the <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical,</hi> can have, if a Bishop, that refuses to own it, and to submit to its Authority, may not be De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd by it? What Security can it have, Especially considering, that Men of that Character are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally Persons of very great Power and Authority, and may easily go a great way in the Subversion of a Government, by the Influence of their Eloquence, and their great Reputation for Learning and Piety? In such a Case is the Bishop to be Depriv'd by a Synod
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:103389:13"/>
of Bishops? Here a Second <hi>Query</hi> will follow, What if <hi>all</hi> the Bishops, that are under a Government should conspire against it? And what if we suppose, that there's onely one Bishop within the Bounds of that Government, a thing that has often happen'd; What must be done in that Case? Will our Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries grant, that, supposing a Bishop should conspire against the Government or Rebel, the Government has Authority to imprison him, or to banish him; but not to <hi>Deprive</hi> him of his Bishoprick, so as that another may be plac'd in his See? If this be the Plea of our Adversaries, I shall then desire to be satisfied in one <hi>Query</hi> more. How does this consist with the Nature and End of Church Government? How can He continue a Pastor that is <hi>utterly</hi> banish'd from his Flock, and render'd <hi>utterly</hi> uncapable of doing the Duty of his Charge? Shall the Neighbour Bishops be his Delegates, and act by his Power and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity? But what if we recur to our former Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, that all the Bishops of a Kingdom are Rebels? When they are all banish'd by the State, who then must govern the Church? Who <hi>ordain,</hi> and do other Duties that are proper to a Bishop? Or supposing that there is but one Bishop; when he is sent into perpetual Banishment, how must his Office be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd? When in the first Planting of the Christian Religion in the several Parts of the World there was onely one Bishop in a Country, as at first in many Countries there was onely one, if that one had been banish'd for Rebellion, pray, what should the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians there planted have done? Should they have liv'd without any Bishop during all his Life that was banish'd, or ought they not rather to have got a new one to govern 'em, to supply the Church with inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:103389:13"/>
Clergy, and the like? Here, <hi>Sir,</hi> I shall put you in mind of those words of the great St. <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> which are urg'd in the Preface to the <hi>Oxford An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity;</hi> when he was unjustly banish'd he charg'd his People, That <hi>as they hop'd for Salvation,</hi> they should be obedient to that Bishop who should succeed him as to himself, <hi>For the Church,</hi> says he, <hi>cannot be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Bishop.</hi> And yet it is certain, that that great Man did never <hi>resign</hi> his Bishoprick, but continued to act as a Bishop of the Catholick Church during all the time of his Banishment, that is, as long as he liv'd. I shall onely add, that if the Banishment of a Bishop be not design'd to be perpetual, as that of St. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostom</hi> was, but onely for a Time, then there may not be any Necessity that another should be plac'd in his See. And this was the Reason, why, when St. <hi>Athanasius,</hi> the Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> was banish'd by the Emperour <hi>Constantine,</hi> there was no new Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch created. That He was banish'd onely for a Time, and that the Emperour <hi>Constantine</hi> intended to recall him, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store him to his Bishoprick, is expresly attested by the Younger Emperour <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> in his <note n="*" place="margin">

            <p>The Solution, <hi>Sir,</hi> of these <hi>Queries,</hi> which I have propos'd, will prove, if I am not mistaken, a Work of no great Ease. I should gladly see the <hi>Knot</hi> fairly <hi>untied,</hi> without any <hi>Cutting</hi> and Violence.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> 1. How does it consist with the Safety of the Church and of Religion, if the Secular Governour has Authority to turn out a Bishop? Then all Bishops may depend on his Sentence, and the Church and Religion be <hi>precarious.</hi> An <hi>Orthodox</hi> Bishop may be depos'd, and a <hi>Heretick</hi> placed in his See.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> It cannot be avoided but that the Church and Religion must be always, in some measure, Precari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and depend upon the Civil Magistrat. If the Governour be an Enemy to Religion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there is no a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding Oppression, wheresoever we lodge the true Power of Depriving a Bishop. Now to answer di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly the Objection: If the Civil Governour should turn out our <hi>Orthodox</hi> Bishops, and put in <hi>Hereticks</hi> in their Places, or put in none at all in their places, then the Church is obliged to adhere to the old Ones turn'd out, or, if there be a necessity, to procure new Ones
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:103389:14"/>
that are <hi>Orthodox.</hi> Thus if the Civil Magistrat should forbid the Christian Religion to be preach'd in his Country, he is not to be obey'd, because it is the Will of our Saviour that his Gospel should be preach'd to all Nations, as far as the Preaching of it does consist with those <hi>Rules</hi> that are truly <hi>essential</hi> to Government. And when <hi>Decius</hi> the Emperour aim'd to root out the Christian Religion in the City of <hi>Rome</hi> by destroying the Bishop <hi>Fabianus,</hi> and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biding that any new Bishop should be Created in his Place; there was no Obligation on the Christians of that Church to obey his Will or Decree, since they did not pretend to choose such a Person as refus'd to submit to his Government. And therefore, tho they defer'd the Election of a new Bishop for above Sixteen Months, for fear of the Emperour, who then resided ar <hi>Rome, Propter rerum &amp; temporum difficultates,</hi> as the <hi>Clergy</hi> tell St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> in a Letter, yet as soon as the Emperour was engag'd in a Civil War, and had therefore remov'd from that City, they set about an Election, and plac'd <hi>Cornelius</hi> in the Chair. This Principle will secure Religion from depending on the Will of a Governour no less than that of our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries, who would have Bishops to be Deprivable onely by Bishops. That likewise may have its ill Consequences, for what if those Bishops, who are suppos'd to Deprive another, should themselves be Heretical, or no true Friends to the Church?</p>
            <p>This Rule is still to be observ'd, that neither the <hi>Civil</hi> nor the <hi>Ecclesiastical Power</hi> may so far <hi>usurp</hi> upon one another as to lessen that Authority which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for the <hi>Subsistence</hi> of Each. Where on either side their Pretensions exceed their due Bounds, there all there Authority ceases. We must neither erect a
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:103389:15"/>
               <hi>Protestant</hi> Popedom, nor yet an <hi>Erastian</hi> Kingdom: Not so <hi>interpret</hi> one <hi>Text</hi> as make it <hi>fall out</hi> with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. There is, as in other Things, so likewise in this, a sort of an <hi>Analogy of Faith:</hi> As they both pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from God; so they cannot in their own Natures disagree in the least. Neither must there such <hi>Maxims</hi> be advanc'd as may make 'em <hi>wage War</hi> with one another. So to order the <hi>Temporal</hi> Government as not to have Regard to the <hi>Spiritual,</hi> is <hi>Prophaness, Irreligion</hi> and <hi>Atheism</hi>; and to lay down such Rules in Favour of the <hi>Spiritual</hi> as that it may <hi>Top</hi> upon the <hi>Temporal</hi> is no less a <hi>Crime</hi> than it is a <hi>Vanity.</hi> In a Word: He cannot <hi>give to God</hi> all <hi>the Things that areGods,</hi> that does not <hi>give to Cesar the Things that are Cesars.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> 2. But it is not in the power of the Civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment to take away that which it could not give, the <hi>Orders</hi> and Character of a Bishop.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> This Objection supposes that when a Bishop is depriv'd of his particular Bishoprick, his <hi>Orders</hi> are taken away, and he is not any longer a Bishop. If the thing be so; look they to it, who refuse to submit to the Civil Government which God has set over 'em. It appears from what has been said, that our Saviour has given no Commission to exercise the Office of a Bishop in such a particular Place, but to such as sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the Government of that Country in which they reside: and if they are not Bishops but in that one Place where first they were design'd to preside, if they have not (I say) any larger Commission, then whenever they refuse to acknowledge the Civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, their whole Commission is void, and they are not any longer Bishops. They are not depriv'd of their Orders by the Civil Power, but their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission which they receiv'd from Christ to exercise
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:103389:15"/>
the Office of a Bishop in that particular Place, is of it self void, as being given only on <hi>Condition,</hi> as soon as they <hi>appear</hi> to be Enemies to the Government, and are so declar'd. Look they, I say, to that. But it is not our opinion, that a Bishop is utterly <hi>Degraded</hi> whensoever he is justly <hi>Depriv'd.</hi> Neither is it agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Notions and Practice of our Church. For if the Character of a Bishop does depend upon the having a Bishoprick, how can a Bishop remain a Bishop after Resignation? How can he be restor'd after (lawful) Deprivation without a new Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? How can he be translated without a new Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation from one Bishoprick to another, if, when he was Ordain'd, he was only Ordain'd to this or that particular Bishoprick? How can he <hi>Ordain,</hi> or do the Offices of a Bishop, out of his own Diocess? If the People of his City or Diocess should be all destroy'd by Wars, or be utterly disperst and lost, how can he remain invested with the Character of a Bishop? And as it is not agreeable to the Doctrine and Practice of our Church, so neither to the general Notions and Practice of the Ancients, as shall easily and plainly be made out, as soon as Occasion is given. At pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent it will be enough, to remind you of what is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove observ'd concerning St. <hi>Chrysostom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Tho it be not my Design at present to enter upon the Authority of the Antients, yet I cannot forbear to take notice of a very strange Weakness of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (for so I must call it) which <hi>Lucifer Calaritanus</hi> has discover'd in his Books to the Emp. <hi>Constantius in behalf of St. Athanasius.</hi> He affirms, amongst other things, that another Bishop ought not to be put into St. <hi>Athanasius</hi>'s Place, as was done at that time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>Athanasius</hi> was living. By which he seems to
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:103389:16"/>
intimate that a Bishop could not be at all <hi>Depriv'd;</hi> but his meaning is, that he could not be Depriv'd by the Emperor. So he says: But how does he prove it? He does not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<note place="margin">

putting a Heretick into his Place. This we know.

By what Authority did St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and his Synod, pretend to call <hi>Therapius</hi> to account, a Bishop as well as themselves? How could they pretend to have Power to turn that Presbyter again out of the Church, as they plainly intimate they had? They deriv'd, you will say, this Authority from the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of the Church.</hi> So Patriarchs, Metropolitans, Arch-Bishops are set over Bishops by the <hi>Consent of the Church,</hi> tho' by Christ's Institution all Bishops are equal. <hi>Query,</hi> Whether the <hi>Consent of the Church of England</hi> (were there nothing else to be alleg'd) be not enough to justify a Lay-Deprivation? If a Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch or Metropolitan can Deprive a Bishop by the Authority of the Church, why may not a <hi>Lay-Iudge</hi> do the like?</p>

            </p>
            <p>As the Authority of the Civil Power, of which we have hitherto spoken, is agreeable to <hi>Principles</hi> and <hi>Reason,</hi> so likewise is it to the Practice and Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of the antient Church. To make this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, and to put an End, if it be possible, to this Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versy, I shall present you, when occasion is given, with <hi>A History of that Authority,</hi> (viz. <hi>of the Civil Power over Ecclesiastical Persons, as well in Depriving as in otherwise punishing) throughout all ages,</hi> more espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially that of the first Christian Emperour. I shall treat concerning that Matter with all the Fairness
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:103389:21"/>
and Impartiality that becomes a faithful Historian, and a real Lover of Truth, concealing nothing that may seem to make for the Cause of our Adversaries. Yet this I shall demonstrat, that tho in the time of <hi>Constantius</hi> some persecuted Bishops were pleas'd to deny that the Emperour had any Autority at all over Bishops, yet the Emperour <hi>Constantine</hi> himself (so great a Lover and Honorer of Bishops as he was) and likewise the succeeding <hi>Orthodox</hi> Emperours, did oftentimes Judge and Deprive Bishops by their own bare Authority: That the Church in the time of that Emperour, as well as in after Ages, submitted to and acknowleg'd that Authority: That those Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal <hi>Canons</hi> which ordain that Bishops (even for Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical Crimes) are to be depriv'd onely by Bishops, did never oblige any Secular Government, but as they were allow'd off, and so made <hi>Laws,</hi> by that Government. I could willingly give you a <hi>Forecast</hi> of a few illustrious Examples of Bishops depriv'd by the Emperour's sole Authority, and the Church's owning and acknowledging that Authority; but I find I have already exceeded what first I design'd on this Subject, and have done like a great many others, who, designing onely a <hi>Lodge,</hi> have been in danger of building 'em a <hi>Seat.</hi> I shall now proceed to the second general Proposition which our Adversaries are desir'd to make out, which is this,</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That it is agreeable to the Practice of the Ancient Christians, for a Bishop unjustly depos'd</hi> (whether by the Emperour, or by Bishops) <hi>to withdraw himself from the Communion of his Successor tho' his Successor were not a Heretick.</hi> Let this be their Proposition: If they prove not that, they prove nothing. And the contrary is plainly demonstrated in our Treatise.
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:103389:21"/>
There are Two things, you tell me, besides the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons</hi> above spoken off, which our Adversaries are wont to allege in Answer to that Treatise. They First endeavour to weaken the Authority of it, and Secondly they pretend that the Examples which it produces, are all of Bishops <hi>Synodically</hi> depriv'd, and therefore not to our Purpose. In answer to this se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Exception, I shall undertake to demonstrat these Two things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That the Ancients had no greater regard to an unjust Synodical Deprivation, than they had to an unjust Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Deprivation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That several of those Bishops that are mention'd in our Treatise, were not Depriv'd Synodically, or by Bishops, but by the Emperour's sole Power and Authority.</hi> Neither did they <hi>resign</hi> their Bishopricks, but were violently turn'd out.</p>
            <p>As for the Objections of our Adversaries against the Authority of our Treatise, tho' I know not of any Treatise of that age and nature that deserves to be more esteem'd, yet to wave all impertinent Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputes, and to shew that what we assert is not ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on that onely Bottom, we will fairly make 'em this Offer: We will lay aside, if they please, the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of that Treatise, and enter the <hi>Lists</hi> with new <hi>Weapons.</hi> This is the Pr<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>position we shall take upon us to demonstrat:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That its contrary to the general Practice of the ancient Bishops, to recede, upon their being unjustly Depriv'd whether by the Emperour onely or by a Synod, from the Communion of an Orthodox Successor.</hi> I say, the <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> Practice: That's enough for us to demonstrat. For what if our Adversaries can produce us one or two Exceptions? How will that excuse Bishops who
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:103389:22"/>
have always profest a great and due regard for the <hi>general</hi> Practice of the Ancients.</p>
            <p>I must not conclude before I have told you, as I promis'd you, what <hi>Schism</hi> th<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

               <hi>Presbyter,</hi> which, as appears by <hi>Cotelerius</hi>'s Copy, was the occasion of the writing our Treatise. You must know, <hi>Sir,</hi> in short, that in the Year 1266. <hi>Arsenius</hi> the Patr. of <hi>CP.</hi> was depos'd by a <hi>Synod,</hi> whereof the Emp. <hi>Michael Palae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ologus</hi> sat <hi>President,</hi> partly for certain Crimes of which he was accus'd, but chiefly for Contumacy in refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to give his Appearance. He knew that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour was his Enemy, and therefore he pleaded that 'twas contrary to the <hi>Canons</hi> for Him to sit Judge in the Cause of a Bishop. The <hi>Synod</hi> (a very great one) both acknowleg'd and asserted the Emperour's Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and alleg'd, it was agreeable both to <hi>Reason</hi> and the <hi>Practice of the Ancients. Germanus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Adrianople,</hi> who was put into <hi>Arsenius</hi>'s Place, resign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after a few Months, <hi>Iosephus,</hi> the Emperour's Confessor and an Abbot, was advanc'd to that Honour. Hence a rose a famous <hi>Schism</hi> amongst the Monks and the Common-people, some adhering to <hi>Arsenius,</hi> as unjustly Depriv'd, others being averse to <hi>Iosephus</hi> because they lookt upon him to have been formerly Excommunicated by <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">

Bishop was put into <hi>Arsenius</hi>'s Place, whilst he was alive; for they presently began it, as it plainly appears from <hi>Pachymeres,</hi> as soon as <hi>Arsenius</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd, before his Place was fill'd up; that is, they withdrew from the Communion (not of the Church in general, but onely) of those Bishops that Depriv'd Him: so <hi>Pachymeres</hi> expresly says of the Bishop of <hi>Alexandria.</hi> —Those Persons that refus'd to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with <hi>Iosephus</hi> upon the Account of <hi>Arse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>'s Deprivation, the Author of our Treatise en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to convince, by shewing by many Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Bishops unjustly Depriv'd, part of them by <hi>Synods,</hi> and part by the Emperour alone, how con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary it was to the Practice of the Ancients to violate the Peace of the Church on the account of such un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just or uncanonical Deprivations.</p>
            <p>Being now assur'd what <hi>Schism</hi> that was, that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion'd the writing of our <hi>Treatise,</hi> we cannot any longer be ignorant of the true <hi>Age</hi> of the <hi>Author.</hi> It cannot reasonably be doubted, but that our <hi>Treatise</hi> was written about the beginning of the <hi>Schism,</hi> and of <hi>Iosephus</hi>'s Patriarchate, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Year 1267<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for <hi>Iosephus</hi> was consecrated Patriarch the First of <hi>Ianu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary</hi> 126<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

It may further be gather'd out of the Sixth Book of <hi>Nicephorus Gregoras,</hi> that this Schism lasted no longer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> than the Year 1275<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for he tells us the manner how it was ended, just after he had spoken of <hi>Gregorius</hi> (Georgius)
