            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Day and Night, and almost given evrie thing a contrarie, so hath
hee made Peace and Warre to haue an interchanging course on

such order as shall bee enjoyned by the commander. Let the

themselues apart, which cannot well bee set downe but in

               <p>The third is, in marching by the enemie, and discharging

               <p>The fourth sort is by divyding the front and reare by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions,
six foote distant, and marching away by the enemie,
and discharging vpon them halfe strings, the first halfe string
marching thorow the division from the right to the left:
the second halfe string discharging vpon the enemie, and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
by the reare or last ranke vnto the left halfe string.</p>
               <p>The fift sort is by divyding the right and left division six
foote distant one from another, the first halfe rankes dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
vpon the enemie, and falling off from the right hand
vnto the reare, the one halfe ranke falleth off by the right

               <p>For brevities sake I deferre all or most kynds of frames

selfe, which Godwilling wil be more profitable to the young
Souldier, than many tables of motions, which are hinderance
to the mynd.</p>
               <p>Heeretofore I haue set foorth briefly and shortly the due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and partes that everie particular officer ought to bee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
with, that hee may bee found qualified for the fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of his place, and discharging the commandement he hath
over a private company. Now my discourse draweth mee
a little higher to the heads, and chiefest officers in an army,
by whom the whole body of the inferior companies are to
bee directed; for as the senses of our body haue residence
in the head to governe the rest of the body, and the sense
of touching and feeing onely is spred abroad thorow the
rest of the parts thereof, that every particular member may
haue functions for the execution of these offices wherevnto
they are appoynted by nature, even so it is in the body of
an armie, from whose chiftane, as from the head should bee
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:507:15"/>
deryved all sort of sense, and in the rest of the inferior mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
should bee found a ready obedience to bee disposed
vpon according to the influence and government that hee
shall thinke most expedient: Now as the health and good
order of the body depend so vpon the constitution of the
head, that if it bee distempered, or the senses troubled, the
actions of the whole man are of that same kynd confuted
and perverted, so the proceedings of an army receaue their
beginning and successe, according to the sense and vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of those who governe therein, and therefore I haue
thought it expedient to speake alittle of them lykewayes,
that everie one at his first entrie into a campe may know
how all things ought to bee rightlie governed, and to whom
hee ought obedience if any thing should fall amisse, so that
from the lowest degree to the highest they bee not ignorant
how the rule of perfection may be aymed at and obteined.</p>
