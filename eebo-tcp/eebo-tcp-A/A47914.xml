            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THis Title may perhaps give the Reader an expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if not a Curiosity to hear more then the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour is willing to tell him: For it is his intent, only to expose the Mistery of the <hi>Contrivance,</hi> of our late Troubles, without the names of the <hi>Persons;</hi> and to shew that the great work of Destroying <hi>three Kingdoms</hi> was only the Project, and Influence of a Private Cabal: and that the Rebellion it self was excited and carry'd on by the Force, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of an <hi>Imposcure</hi> then of a <hi>Confederacy;</hi> The Generality of the people, being powerfully, and artificially Possess'd by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Patrons of our Religious, and Civill Liberties, that <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery</hi> and <hi>Arbitrary Power</hi> were breaking in upon us, and the design promoted by the Interest of a Court-Faction; It could not chuse but create in them the tenderest affection imaginable for the one Party, and as violent a Detestation for the other: Especially considering that the <hi>Person</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>King</hi> were as yet <hi>Sacred;</hi> and uot any man open'd his Mouth, but for his <hi>Honour,</hi> and <hi>safety;</hi> the <hi>Purity</hi> of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> and the Peace of the <hi>Kingdome.</hi> For such was the Reverence the Nation had, at that time, for the <hi>King,</hi> and the <hi>Law,</hi> that the least word against the Government had spoyl'd all.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Double-refining spirit</hi> came into the World, even with <hi>the Reformation it self;</hi> when by flying from one Extreme to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it left the Truth in the middle; which <hi>Calvin</hi> himself rakes notice of in a Letter to the <hi>Protector</hi> (in <hi>Ed.</hi> 6.) <hi>There are two sorts of Seditious men</hi> (says he, speaking of the <hi>Papists</hi> and the <hi>Puritans) and against both these must the sword be drawn; For they oppose the King, and God himself.</hi> It was the same Spirit that mov'd the Distemper afterward at <hi>Frankfort;</hi> and the same still, that made such havock in <hi>Scotland;</hi> and flew in the face of Q. <hi>Eliz.</hi> her <hi>Parliaments</hi> and <hi>Councill:</hi> till she was forced to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press it by Severity and Rigour. Her successor King <hi>James,</hi> after a long Persecution in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and a fresh attempt upon him

at <hi>Hampton Court,</hi> by the same Faction: took them up roundly, once for all, and so past the rest of his days in some measure of quiet. But the Plot succeeded better under King <hi>Charles;</hi> when taking advantage of his Majesties necessitys, with the Infinite goodness of his Nature, that made him apt to believe the best of all men, and a Popular mixture in the House of Commons, that was still ready for their turn, they pursu'd him with <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Entitled, <hi>A Remonstrance of the State of the Kingdome,</hi> they accomplished their ends, under ehe Countenance of the <hi>Fifth.</hi> By what steps, and Methods they gained their Poynt, comes now to be consider'd.</p>
            <p>Their first advance toward a <hi>Sedition,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">The Schism led the way to the Sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> was the introducing of a <hi>Schism;</hi> by distinguishing themselves, under the Name of the <hi>Godly Party,</hi> from the rest of the Nation: which they found to be the safest way of approach, and the most plausible expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient. To this end they brought in <hi>Lecturers</hi> over the Heads of <hi>Parochial Ministers;</hi> whose maintenance being dependent upon the Faction, made them wholly at the devotion of their Patrons.</p>
            <p>They had their <hi>Emissaries</hi> also in all Corporations,<note place="margin">Emissaries in Corporations</note> and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous  parts of the Kingdom, that were appointed as <hi>Feoffees,</hi> to deal for <hi>Impropriations,</hi> under the charitable pretext of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a better <hi>Provision</hi> for the <hi>Ministry.</hi> And these were men of publick business in the World, as Clergy-men, Lawyers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> well known, and made famous for their Zeal, by the Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of so pious an Undertaking. By this project they advanced considerable Sums of Money; but the Incumbents little the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for it: For either it stuck to the <hi>Feoffees</hi> fingers, or it was applyed to other uses; and with the <hi>Tithe</hi> of a <hi>Parsonage</hi> in one place, a <hi>Lecture</hi> was set up in another.</p>
            <p>After the Choice of fit Instruments; their next work was to secure them from any trouble of <hi>Church-Censures:</hi> To which end, they bought some <hi>Headship</hi> or other in an University, for some Eminent man of their own way, for the training up of Novices in their Discipline. <note place="margin">Seminaries of Novices.</note> And then they had a kind of a <hi>Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical Seminary</hi> at St. <hi>Antholines</hi> in <hi>London;</hi> where their Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples were in a manner, upon a Probation, for Abilities, and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections: and out of this Nursery they furnish'd most of their New-bought <hi>Impropriations.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:95840:3"/>
These young <hi>Emissaries</hi> of theirs had their Salary, and were subordinate to a <hi>Classis</hi> or <hi>Clero-Laicall Consistory,</hi> to be trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted <note place="margin">Their Agents were upon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

And yet this Consistory did not so strictly confine themselves to their Own Members; but upon Letters Testimonial from the Patriarchs of the Party, that such or such a man was fit for their turn; or had given proof of his fidelity to the Cause, by undergoing some sentence for contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Orders of the Church, and persisting Obstinately in that disobedience: to such a man, (I say) in such a Case, they commonly allow'd a Preference. And the better to avoid the danger of the Spiritual Courts, they made it their business to provide <hi>Commissaries</hi> of their Own Leaven, where they had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny special Plantation. And Lastly, to make sure of their Agents, that they should not fall off when they had serv'd their own turns, they kept them only as <hi>Pentioners at pleasure,</hi> and liable to be turn'd out at any time, either if they cool'd in the <hi>Holy Cause,</hi> or fail'd of Preaching according to the direction of the <hi>Conclave.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let it be noted here by the by, that the design and mischief <note place="margin">Their Lectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers are sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd by our Conventicles.</note> of those <hi>Lecturers,</hi> when they could nor so well Congregate in <hi>Private Meetings,</hi> is, in our days, supply'd, if not outdone, by a greater number of <hi>Conventicles;</hi> to the very same Intent; and God grant it prove not with the like effect.</p>
            <p>They were as yet but upon the <hi>Preparatory</hi> to the great work of their <hi>Thorough Reformation;</hi> which in plain <hi>English</hi> was the <note place="margin">The People were poyson'd from the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit.</note> 
               <hi>Dissolution</hi> of the <hi>Government.</hi> So that the Pulpits had nothing more to do at present, then to dispose and accommodate the Humours and Affections of the People. The Common Subject of the Pulpit (and they all sung the same Song) was <hi>First</hi> to irritate the Multitude against Popery: which had been well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, if they had not, <hi>Secondly,</hi> by sly Insinuations, under the Notion of <hi>Arminianism,</hi> intimated the Church of <hi>England</hi> to be leaning that way. By this Artifice the People were quickly brought into a dislike of the <hi>English Communion;</hi> and by degrees into as fierce an Aversion to the One Church, as to the Other. Now whatsoever the <hi>Government Lost,</hi> the <hi>Faction Gain'd:</hi> And those <hi>Pedantique Levites,</hi> that brought so many dreadfull Judgments upon this Nation themselves; were by the Credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, Tumultuary Rabble cry'd up and Idolized, as the very <hi>Moses</hi>'s that stood in the Gap to avert them. Having by this means render'd the Government <hi>Odious,</hi> and given some credit
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95840:4"/>
to the <hi>Schism;</hi> their next Instruction was, to make Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Numbers, the quality and the sobriety of the Persons aggriev'd; to possesse the one side with a confidence, and the <note place="margin">The boast of their Num bers.</note> other with an apprehension of their strength! <hi>Thousands of Souls ready to Famish,</hi> (they cry) <hi>for want of the Bread of Life. How many Insufficient negligent and scandalous Pastors? How many Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations destitute of able, Faithfull Teachers; Preaching in season and out of season, and labouring in the Word? Alas! they dare not consent to any Addition to, or Diminution of Christs Worship, or to the Use of the Inventions of Men, in Gods Service. They desire only the Freedom that Christ and his Apostles have left unto the Churches; and to serve God according to the Example of the best Reformed Churches abroad. This is the Case of Thousands of the upright of the Land.</hi> Let it be understood, that the <hi>Press</hi> all this while kept pace with the <hi>Pulpit;</hi> only now and then there started out a Party upon the Forelorn, to make Discoveries, and try the Temper of the Government. Some scap'd, and others were taken, and censur'd; as <hi>Leighton, Burton, Prin,</hi> and <hi>Bastwick,</hi> who only shewed themselves inconsiderately before their Friends were ready to Second them.</p>
            <p>We shall see now how they changed their stile with their Condition; and how their boldness encreased with their Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest. <note place="margin">They grow upon the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</note> Their grievances at first, were only a dark and a doubtfull Prospect of <hi>Popery,</hi> and <hi>Popish Innovations</hi> afar off; and an anx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iety of thought for the calamities that were coming upon Gods People through the corruptions of the Times. But success o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening their Eyes, they are coming now to discover more and more Popery nearer hand: They find the <hi>Church-men</hi> to be <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pishly affected;</hi> the <hi>Liturgy</hi> to be no other then an <hi>English Mass-Book;</hi> the <hi>Hierarchy</hi> it self and all the <hi>Courts,</hi> and <hi>Officers</hi> depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon it, to be directly <hi>Anti-Christian:</hi> They charge his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty to be <hi>Popishly affected,</hi> and all that will not renounce him, to be either flat <hi>Papists</hi> or <hi>Worse,</hi> imposing <hi>Protestations, Covenants, Engagements</hi> of <hi>Confederacy</hi> against both <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Church;</hi> and Oaths of <hi>Abjuration:</hi> as the <hi>Tests</hi> of a <hi>Loyall Protestant:</hi> passing an <hi>Anathema</hi> upon any man that interposes betwixt their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, and their Soveraign: They prostitute the Sacred Function for Mony; they suck the blood of <hi>Widdows</hi> and of <hi>Orphans;</hi> By vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence taking possession of <hi>Eighty five Livings</hi> at one clap, out of <hi>Ninety seaven,</hi> within the Walls of <hi>London;</hi> exposing so many Reverend, and Loyal Divines with their Families, to the wide

               <hi>Think not to save your selves by an unrighteous saving of them, who are the Lords, and the Peoples known Enemies, you may not imagine to obtain the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of those against whom you will not do Justice: For certainly, if you act not like Gods in this particular, against men truly obnoxious to Justice; they will be like Devils against you. Observe that place,</hi> 1 Kings 22. 31. <hi>compared with</hi> Cap. 20. <hi>It is said in</hi> Chap. 20. <hi>that the King of</hi> Syria <hi>came against</hi> Israel, <hi>and by the mighty power of God, he and his Army were overthrown, and the King was taken Prisoner. Now the mind of God was (which he then discover'd only by that present Providence) that Justice should have been executed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, but it was not. Whereupon the Prophet comes with ashes upon his face, and waited for the King of</hi> Israel, <hi>in the way where he should return; and as the King passed by, he cry'd unto him, thus saith the Lord, because thou hast let go a man whom I appointed for Destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, therefore thy Life shall go for his Life. Now see how the King of</hi> Syria, <hi>after this, answers</hi> Ahab's <hi>love: about three years after,</hi> Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el <hi>and</hi> Syria <hi>engaged in a new War, and the King of</hi> Syria <hi>gives command unto his Souldiers, that they should fight neither against small nor great, but against the King of</hi> Israel. Benhadads <hi>Life was once in</hi> Ahabs <hi>hand, and he ventur'd Gods displeasure, to let him go. But see how</hi> Benhadad <hi>rewards him for it? Fight neither against Small nor Great, but against the King of</hi> Israel, <hi>Honourable, and Worthy. If God do not lead you to do Justice upon those that have been great Actors in shedding Innocent Blood, never think to gain their Love by sparing of them; for they will, if Opportunity be ever offer'd, return again upon you. And then they will not fight against the poor,</hi>

            <p>For the compassing of these accursed ends, they still accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated <note place="margin">Baits for all Parties.</note> themselves to the matter they had to work upon.

For there was no good to be done upon the <hi>Imperial Monarchy</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> without First confounding the <hi>Subordinate Monarchy</hi> of the City of <hi>London,</hi> and creating a perfect Understanding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the <hi>Caball,</hi> and the <hi>Common-Council:</hi> which was very much facilitated, by casting out the Loyal, and Orthodox Clergy, and teaching all the Pulpits in <hi>London</hi> to speak the same Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage with <hi>Margarets Westminster.</hi> But let us consider the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the City of <hi>London,</hi> First, in the due, and Regular Administration of it; and then in its corruptions, and by what means it come afterwards to be debauch'd.</p>
            <p>The City of <hi>London,</hi> was long before the Conquest, Govern'd <note place="margin">The Legal Government of the City of <hi>London.</hi>
               </note> by <hi>Port-Reeves:</hi> and so down to <hi>Richard</hi> the <hi>First,</hi> who gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them several Priviledges in acknowledgment of the Good Offices they had render'd him. But the <hi>First Charter</hi> they had for the Choice of their Own <hi>Mayor,</hi> or <hi>Government,</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd upon them by <hi>King John,</hi> in these words. <hi>Know ye that we have granted to our Barons</hi> (or <hi>Freemen) of our City of</hi> London, <hi>that they may chuse unto themselves a</hi> Mayor <hi>of themselves.</hi> And their following Charter of <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Third</hi> runs thus. <hi>We grant also unto the said Citizens, that they may yearly present to our Barons of the Exchequer (we or our Heirs not being at</hi> Westminster) <hi>every Mayor which they shall first chuse in the City of</hi> London, <hi>to the end they may be by them admitted as Mayor.</hi> In a following Charter of <hi>Ed. 2. That the Mayor and Sheriffs of the City aforesaid, may be chosen by the Citizens of the said City; according to the Tenour of the Charter of our Progenitors, (sometimes Kings of</hi> England) <hi>to that end made; and not otherwise.</hi> The Charter of <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. runs to the

Mayor, Commonalty and Citizens of <hi>London, Conjunctim.</hi> The Charter of <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. is thus. <hi>We have granted further for Us and our Heirs, and by this our present Charter confirm'd to the Mayor, and Aldermen of the City aforesaid; that if any customs in the said City hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto obtained and used, be in any part Difficult or Defective, or any thing</hi> in the same newly happening, where before there was no remedy Ordained, and have need of amending, the said <hi>Mayor</hi> and <hi>Aldermen,</hi> and their Successours with the assent of the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manalty</hi> of the same City, may add and ordain a remedy meet, faithfull, and consonant to reason, for the Common profit of the Citizens of the same City, as oft, and at such time as to them shall be thought expedient.</p>
            <p>We have the rather cited these clauses in favour of the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <note place="margin">The Charter of the Lord Mayor and Aldermen</note> Government of the City; in regard that they have been so often, and so earnestly perverted another way. The <hi>Charter</hi> we see, is directed to the <hi>Lord Mayor</hi> and <hi>Aldermen</hi> of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; the Power is granted to them, to propose the making or mending of Laws, as they see occasion; only by the affent, or dissent of the Commons, they are ratifyed or hindred. And those Laws are only Acts of Common-Council, that is to say, not of the Commonalty alone, but of the Lord Mayor, Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and Commons, in concurrence. Some there are that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake the word <hi>Conjunctim,</hi> and would have <hi>Jointly,</hi> to be <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually:</hi> as if one could not have a <hi>greater</hi> interest or Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and <hi>another a lesse,</hi> though in a <hi>Joint Commission.</hi> The Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, in short, of summoning, and Dissolving Common-Councils, and of putting any thing to the question, does legally reside only in the Lord Mayor. And the <hi>Active Power</hi> in the <hi>Making</hi> of a Law, and the <hi>Negative</hi> Voice in the <hi>Hindering</hi> of a Law, have been by long Prescription and usage, in the Lord Mayor and Aldermen. And these being <hi>customs of the City,</hi> every <hi>Freeman</hi> is to support and maintain them by the Obligation of his Oath. And in farther proof that the Lord Mayor and Aldermen are by their Charter invested with the Powers aforesaid; We shall need only to enform our selves who they are that in case of any publick Disorder, are made answerable for the Misdemeanour. <hi>Richard</hi> the <hi>Second</hi> granted a Commission <hi>to enquire of all and singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Errours, Defects, and Misprisions in the City of</hi> London, <hi>for want of Good Government in the</hi> Mayor, Sheriffs <hi>and</hi> Aldermen <hi>of the said City.</hi> And for the <hi>Errours, Defects,</hi> and <hi>Misprisions,</hi> in their Government sound, they were fin'd 3000. <hi>Marks;</hi> the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties</hi>

            <p>We have here given you a short view of the Orderly Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of this glorious City; which is perchance one of the best qualify'd Establishments both for King and People, under the cope of Heaven. We are now coming to lay open by what Arts and Contrivances it came to be corrupted; and in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, to lay Violent hands upon it self: Which is a story that may serve some for curiosity, and others for Edification.</p>
            <p>The People being extreamly discomposed in their minds upon the Apprehension of <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Arbitrary Power;</hi> and <note place="margin">In what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the People were wrought upon.</note> shaken also in their <hi>Allegiance,</hi> upon a strong Impression that it was a design in their Governours themselves to introduce it. It was no hard matter to inveigle them into <hi>Petitions</hi> for Relief, <hi>Protestations, Associations</hi> and <hi>Covenants,</hi> for the Common de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of themselves, in the preservation of their <hi>Liberties</hi> and <hi>Religion;</hi> and into a favourable Entertainment of any plausible pretext even for the Justification of Violence it self: Especially the <hi>Sedition</hi> coming once to be Baptized <hi>Gods cause,</hi> and suppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Doctrine of <hi>Necessity</hi> and the unsearchable <hi>Instinct</hi> and <hi>Equity of the Law of Nature:</hi> And all this too, Recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and Inculcated to them by the men of the whole World, upon whose Conduct and Integrity, they would venture their very Souls, Bodies and Estates. Being thus perswaded, and possess'd; the coming in of the <hi>Scots</hi> serv'd them both for a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of the ground of their fears, and for an Authority to follow that Pattern in their Proceedings; both causes being founded upon the same Bottom, and both Parties united in the same Conspiracy. So that this opportunity was likewise im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by all sorts of ayery Phantastical Plots, frivolous and childish reports, to cherish the Delusion: And now was the time for <hi>Tumults</hi> and <hi>Out-rages</hi> upon publique Ministers, and Bishops, nay and upon the King himself; till by Arms and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries they forc'd him away from his Palace, when yet they had the confidence to charge his Sacred Majesty with making War upon his Parliament. But this would not yet do their business, till they got Possession of the <hi>Militia;</hi> which at length they did: the Presses and the Pulpits all this while giving life and credit to their Proceedings.</p>

Upon the tuning of mens minds for <hi>Innovations,</hi> by making them sick of the present state of things; <note place="margin">The Artifice of Petitions.</note> the People were easily prevail'd upon to <hi>Petition</hi> for what they so much wish'd for and desir'd: and this was the second step toward the <hi>Tyranny,</hi> and <hi>Slavery</hi> that ensu'd upon it.

               <hi>first to Petition, then to Protest, then to Dictate, and at last to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</hi> The Faction made use of Petitions as common House<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breakers do of screws; they got in by little and little, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much noise, and so Risled the Government: Or they did rather like the counterfeit Glasiers, that took down the Glasse at Noonday under colour of mending the Windows, and then Robb'd the House.</p>
            <p>To make a right Judgment upon a Popular Petition we should first consider the matter of it<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> Secondly, the wording of it. Thirdly, the manner of Promoting it. Fourthly, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable intent of it. And Lastly, we should do well to consult History and Experience to see what effects such Petitions have commonly produced.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Subject-Matter</hi> of Popular Petitions, it is either for publique concernment or private; Generall or particular: That is to say concerning the whole Body of the People, or on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly some <hi>part</hi> of it. It is either within the Petitioners <hi>Cognizance,</hi> and <hi>Understanding,</hi> or it is not; It varies according to the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances of <hi>Times, Occasions,</hi> and <hi>Parties:</hi> and it often falls out, especially where it treats of <hi>Reformation,</hi> that the one half of it is a <hi>Petition,</hi> and the other a <hi>Libell.</hi> The Case of that is purely <hi>Private,</hi> or <hi>Particular,</hi> cannot properly be call'd <hi>Popular;</hi> and so not to our purpose. There are likewise <hi>Mixt Cases</hi> of <hi>Publick</hi> and <hi>Private;</hi> as in the Calamities of <hi>War, Pestilence, Fires, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>udations</hi> and the like; where <hi>Numerous Subscriptions</hi> are matter of <hi>Attestation,</hi> rather then <hi>Clamour;</hi> on the behalf of such and such <hi>Known,</hi> and <hi>Particular Sufferers.</hi> Now there is a great heed to be given to the Petitions of men both that <hi>Understand</hi> what it is they ask, and whom the Law has made <hi>Competent Judges</hi> of it. But where the Question is, the Redresse of <hi>Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances</hi> in matter of <hi>State,</hi> the <hi>Complaining</hi> part of the <hi>Petition</hi> makes it only <hi>a more Artificiall Scandall:</hi> Besides the dangerous boldness of Intermeddling in points which they neither have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing <hi>to do withall,</hi> nor one jot <hi>Understand.</hi> Such as the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition

            <p>They took away his Power also of <hi>Dissolving</hi> them, and kept him to his seat, till they thought fit to discharge him.</p>

            <p>To bring this Pamphlet to a Conclusion, we shall only say this further in justification of it, that it was written with a very <hi>Honest Intention;</hi> that the matter of <hi>Fact</hi> is partly upon <hi>Certain Knowledg,</hi> and partly upon the credit of very <hi>Warrantable Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers.</hi> The principal Scope of it was, to lay open the <hi>Mistery</hi> and <hi>Method</hi> of the <hi>Late Rebellion;</hi> and so to expose it, that the <hi>same Project,</hi> and <hi>Model</hi> may not be made use of for <hi>Another.</hi>
