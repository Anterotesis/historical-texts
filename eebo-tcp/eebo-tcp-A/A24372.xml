            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The Imperialiſts, who could not be diſcouraged by any Difficulties, advanced towards the Enemy, to force them to a Battel: And, about five in the Evening, the Fight begun, which was very ſharp for ſome time; but our Men preſſed ſo hard upon the Turks, that they at laſt broke their Body, and put them to flight: It is reckoned, that above 6000 were ſlain, and the Slaughter would have been much greater, had not the coming on of the Night hindered our purſuit. We took 29 pieces of Cannon, all the Enemies Tents, Baggage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the next day our Troops entered, without any oppoſition, into <hi>Niſſa,</hi> which is fortified with ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Redoubts, a good Ditch, and Paliſſado's.</p>

               <p>ON the 9th inſtant, about four in the Afternoon, we ſtormed the Counterſcarp with 8000 Men, the Brandenburghers on the Right, and the Hollanders and Munſteriens on the Left; and, after a warm diſpute of about two hours, made our ſelves Maſters of it, and of two Half-Moons, with the loſs on our ſide of about 800 Men kill'd and wounded, and 600 of the Enemy. At the ſame time the Imperialiſts attack'd and took the Hornwork, with little loſs; and afterwards lodged themſelves like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe on the Counterſcarp. During the Aſſault, as well on the Counterſcarp as the Hornwork, the Enemy ſprang ſeveral Mines, but with little effect. After the Fight was over, Count <hi>Alsfelt,</hi> the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, deſired a Suſpenſion of Arms for two hours, (which was granted;) and offered to ſurrender the place upon certain Conditions, one of which was, <hi>That</hi> 20 <hi>Perſons ſhould be permitted to march out mask'd</hi>; but the Elector of <hi>Brandenburgh</hi> abſolutely rejected them. In the Night we lodged our ſelves in the Ravelins, the Contregard, and in the Ditch; and fixed our Miners to the Body of the place. The next morning the Enemy again beat a Parley, and, Hoſtages being exchanged, three Officers were ſent out of the Town with new Propoſals; but his Electoral Highneſs would only allow the Gariſon to be Priſoners of War; however the Treaty ſtill continues, and the Suſpenſion is prolonged till this day at Noon; and if the Beſieged do not, by that time, accept of the Terms that are offered them, we ſhall ſtorm the Town.</p>
               <p>The principal Officers kill'd or wounded in the Aſſault on the Counterſcarp are, The Lieutenant Generals <hi>Delwich</hi> and <hi>Swarts</hi> lightly wounded; the Major-General Baron <hi>de Heyde</hi> wounded in the Arm, and Major General <hi>Belling</hi> in the Shoulder; Colonel <hi>Kroeſmarke</hi> and Colonel <hi>Swerin</hi> kill'd; and Colonel Count <hi>de Dona</hi> wounded. Lieutenant-Colonel <hi>Natſmer</hi> wounded; Major <hi>Prus</hi> kill'd; and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor <hi>Grand</hi> dangerouſly wounded; with ſeveral other inferior Officers kill'd and wounded.</p>
               <p>Yeſterday the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> received by an Expreſs the News of another defeat of the Turks near <hi>Niſſa.</hi>
